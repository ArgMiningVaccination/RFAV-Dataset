We have shown in mouse models that invasive bacterial disease starts after rare events of within -macrophage replication of bacteria which then shed back into the blood causing invasive disease. Through two clinical trials, we ha ve access to human spleens and liver segments which can be maintained viable by ex vivo organ perfusion. Infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae shows efficient clearance by the different splenic macrophages sub -types including CD68+CD163+CD169 periarteriolar sheath macrophages. These first observations at the whole organ level indicate that in both upon human red pulp and the perifollicular sheath macrophages, rare cells are permissive to intracellular bacterial replication. Apoptosis, visualised with anti -cleaved -caspase 3 antibodies, is observed about eight times more frequently in CD169+ macrophages when compared to other cell types. As in mice, the CD169+ ma crophages appear to be \"stressed\" during encounter with invasive bacteria and we hypothesis that, also in humans, the CD169+ macrophages could be the weak element in our defence from invasive infection. Vancomycin disrupts macrophage antifungal immunit Rebecca Drummond1,3 1Institute of Microbiology and Infection, School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham , UK; 2Division of Natural Sciences, School of Biosciences, University of Kent, Canterbury, UK; 3Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College and Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham , UK Prolonged antibiotic use is a controllable risk factor for systemic cand idiasis. In recent years, antibiotics have been shown to have off -target detrimental effects on immune cells, but whether antibiotics disrupt antifungal immunity is unknown. We recently found that the antibiotic vancomycin enhanced mortality from invasive candidiasis in mice, whereas other antibiotics (e.g. metronidazole) did not affect susceptibility. To examine the mechanisms by which vancomycin impairs anti -Candida immunity, we explored how vancomycin pre -treatment of bone -marrow derived macrophages (BMD Ms) impacted their responses to C. albicans challenge. Vancomycin - treated macrophages had reduced fungal killing, although phagocytosis of yeast cells was only modestly affected. Instead, vancomycin -treated macrophages exhibited impaired mitochondrial func tion, in which they failed to upregulate their respiratory capacity when stimulated with Candida. We used confocal microscopy to examine the mitochondria, which showed reduced mitochondrial mass, reduced membrane potential and morphological changes in vanc omycin -treated macrophages that have been previously linked to dysfunctional metabolic activity. Indeed, both an unbiased metabolite screen and bulk RNA -sequencing revealed several dysregulated pathways linked with mitochondrial dysfunction. For example, v ancomycin -treated macrophages have an early upregulation of genes involved in inflammasome activation and pyroptosis, along with enhanced expression of mitochondrial -localised anti -inflammatory enzymes and lipids that have not been previously explored in t he context of antifungal immunity. Our ongoing studies aim to determine which of these mediators prevents fungal killing by the vancomycin -treated macrophages. Taken together, our results improve our understanding of the pathways regulating antifungal immu nity in macrophages and suggest that antibiotic -induced susceptibility to C. albicans may be partly driven by disrupted macrophage function. Complement and inflammatory marker analysis in women with obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome 2Tommy's National Centre for Miscarriage 3Birmingham Women's Children's NHS Foundation Trust, UK; 4Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, UK Background Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) affects >6000 couples/year in the UK, having significant physical and psychological consequences. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune condition, associated with increased thrombosis risk. APS is commonly identified through its obstetric features (OAPS), being the most frequent treatable RPL risk factor. However, the mechanism underlying RPL - APS association remains unidentified. Methods annexin V , plasma and serum of women with OAPS (N=44), RPL without APS (RPL) (N=48), and healthy controls (N=50) were investigated via ELISA. Results Both C3a (p=0.0052) and IL -5 (p=0.0044) levels were elevated in OAPS, compared to RPL. Annexin V was reduced in both the RPL and OAPS cohorts (p=0.0069), while Granzyme B appeared decreased in RPL (p=0.0266), but not OAPS. Conclusions Increased C3a in OAPS indicates complement dysregulation, although not affecting t he terminal complement complex (SC5b -9). Elevated IL -5, also seen in OAPS, may promote B cell survival and differentiation, enhancing autoantibody production. Reduction in annexin V, which inhibits prothrombin activation, was not limited to OAPS, but also seen in the RPL cohort. Interestingly, granzyme B decrease, which is also linked to the coagulation/fibrinolysis pathway dysregulation, was only seen in women with RPL without APS. Although RPL has not been independently associated with thrombosis, our fin dings indicate that pro - thrombotic dysregulation underlies this condition, regardless of APS status. We are aiming combine this work with antiphospholipid antibody profile assessment, to identify women in increased risk of subsequent pregnancy loss, promot ing a personalised approach to antenatal treatment. Large E -cadherin+ CD103+ CD8+ T cells invade biliary epithelial cells through interactions with - catenin Scott P Davies1, 2, Vincenzo Ronca1, 2, 3, 4, Grace E Wootton1, 2, 4 ,7, Amber G Bozward1 ,2 ,4 ,7, R\u00e9mi Fiancette1, 2, Gary M Reynolds1, 2, Natalia Osei -Bordom1, 2, Richardson1,2,4,7, Liam M Grover5, 6 and Ye H Oo1, 2, 4, 7 1Centre for Liver and Gastrointestinal Research, Institute of Biomedical Research, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, UK ; 2NIHR Birmingham Biomedical Research Centre, University of Birmingham and University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, UK ; 3Division of Gastroenterology, Center for Autoimmune Liver Dise ases, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano Bicocca, Italy ; 4European Reference Network on Hepatological Diseases (ERN Rare -Liver), Birmingham, UK ; 5School of Chemical Engineering, University of Birmingham, UK ; 6Healthcare Technologies I nstitute, University of Birmingham, UK ; 7Birmingham Advanced Cellular Therapy Facility, University of Birmingham, UK Background The liver is a hotspot for lymphocyte -based cell -in-cell structures (CICs). Recently, the presence of CD8+ T cells within bilia ry epithelial cells (BEC) has also been demonstrated histologically. We aim to further characterise these T cells and their mechanism of internalisation. Methods We developed a high -content imaging (HCI) co -culture platform to quantify and characterize th e internalisation of human T cells into primary human BEC. This assay was used to observe the effect of T cell receptor (TCR) activation, to compare CD8+ T cells to CD4+ T cells, and to investigate the effect of small molecular inhibitors. T cell phenotypi ng was performed in vitro using flow cytometry and in vivo using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Individual sub -populations of CD8+ T cells were isolated using fluorescence -activated cell sorting (FACS). Results CD8+ T cell internalization into BEC was more f requent amongst larger cells and 48 hr following TCR - mediated activation. CD8+ T cells invaded BEC more frequently compared to CD4+ T cells. CD8+ T cells expressed CD103+ and CD69+ both in vitro and in vivo when internalising into BEC. Inhibitors of Phosph oinositide 3 -kinase (PI3K) signaling, and actin remodeling, significantly reduced this invasion. E-cadherin expression by CD8+ T cells correlated with frequency of internalisation. Furthermore, CD8+ T cells interactions with BEC surfaces were enriched with E-cadherin and -catenin. FACS - sorted E -cadherin+ CD8+ T cells were larger than E -cadherin - CD8+ T cells and invaded BEC more frequently. Conclusions We unveil a distinct cell -in-cell structure in the liver, whereby BEC are invaded by E -cadherin+ CD103+ C D69+ CD8+ T cells. Blockade of lag3 synergizes responses to anti -PD-L1 through increasing duration of T cell receptor signalling Lozan Sheriff and David Bending University of Birmingham, UK Background: PD -1 and its ligand PD -L1 are attractive candidates for cancer immunotherapy and their blockade has shown clinical efficacy in several cancer types. We recently developed a new metric, \"TCR.strong\", that represents five genes (IRF8, OX40, STAT4, TNIP3, ICOS) to anti -PD1 immunotherapy in CD4+T cells. However, despite these successes, most patients fail to respond to single agent immunotherapy and adverse event rates are frequently high. Combinations of immunotherapy have largely been selected on an empi rical basis and deeper mechanistic insight is lacking. Here we sought to rationally identify more effective immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) combinations. Methods: We utilised an accelerated adaptive tolerance model, using Tg4 Nr4a3 -Tocky mice to explore T cell phenotypic changes in response to anti -PD-L1 or combinatorial anti -PD-L1 and anti - Lag3 immunotherapy. We performed RNAseq on rechallenged cells and modulated the length of TCR sinalling using pharmalogical inhibitor to understand how TCR sinal durati on regulates key T cell activation markers. Results: Combination therapy increased T cell activation and prolonged expression of the TCR.strong metric, which was driven by an increased duration of TCR signalling. RNAseq revealed that combinatorial thera py sustained a wide range of genes indicative of strong TCR signalling, which was not the case for monotherapy. In addition, T cells showed enhanced metabolic enzyme expression and ribosomal biogenesis. Conclusions: Our -blockade of PD -L1 and Lag3 results in synergistic T cell activation which is driven by an increased duration of TCR signalling, which results in augmented metabolism and biosynthesis. Phosphoinositide acyl chain saturation drives CD8+ effector changes support CD8+ effector T (Teff) cell differentiation is not well understood. Here we show that, although naive T cells are rich in polyunsaturated phosphoinositides (PIPn with 3-4 double bonds), Teff PIPn marked by sat urated fatty acyl chains (0 -2 double bonds). PIPn are precursors for second messengers. Polyunsaturated phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) exclusively supported signaling immediately upon T cell antigen receptor activation. In late Teff cells, activi ty of phospholipase C -1, the enzyme cleaves PIP2 into downstream mediators, waned, and saturated PIPn became essential for sustained signaling. Saturated PIP was more rapidly converted to PIP2 with subsequent recruitment of phospholipase C - 1, and lo ss of saturated PIPn impaired Teff cell fitness and function, even in cells with abundant polyunsaturated PIPn. Glucose was the substrate for de novo PIPn synthesis, and was rapidly utilized for saturated PIP2 generation. Thus, separate PIPn pools with dis tinct acyl chain compositions and metabolic dependencies drive important signaling events to initiate and then sustain effector function during CD8+ T cell differentiation. Poster presentations P.01 Using fluorescent ligands as flow cytometry prob es: 1Division of Physiology, Pharmacology and Neuroscience, School of Life Sciences, University of Nottingham, UK; 2Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, School of Medicine, Biodiscovery Institute, University of Nottingham, UK; 3Centre of Membrane Proteins and Rec eptors, University of Birmingham and Nottingham, The Midlands, UK; 4Division of Biomolecular Science and Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Biodiscovery Institute, University of Nottingham, UK Adenosine is a molecule responsible for tissue homeostasi s, with upregulation of levels in stressed/damaged tissues. In the tumour microenvironment, high levels of adenosine lead to suppression of immune cells which are attempting to attack or control the tumour, resulting in failure of immunotherapy. Adenosine signals via four G -protein coupled receptors: A1, A2A, A2B and A3. These have been shown to be expressed at the gene level in macrophages, one of the key immune cells in the tumour. Because of their complex structure, it is difficult to generate tradition al antibodies against the adenosine receptors (AR), making flow cytometry analysis of AR expression challenging. Recently, we have been developing fluorescent ligands based on small molecules specific to AR as a tool for characterising AR expression and fu nction on primary cells. Two ligands specific to the A2A and A2B ARs have been generated and validated and are highly selective antagonists of the respective AR. We used these newly synthesised fluorescent ligands to investigate the expression profile of A 2A and A2B AR in human primary macrophages via flow cytometry. Preliminary data indicate that these ligands bind and can be displaced by unlabelled ligand, indicating AR -specific binding on macrophages, and once confirmed, will demonstrate the utility of t hese ligands to characterise AR levels on primary cells. Depending on macrophage subset, results indicate different levels of A2A and A2B. Future work aims to study the role of macrophage polarisation on AR profile and levels, to confirm which AR should be primary therapeutic targets in cancer immunotherapy. P.02 Streptococcus uberis exploits NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the envelope serine protease SUB1154 Abbie Tomes , Prof Notti ngham, UK Bovine mastitis is an intramammary inflammatory disease which severely impacts dairy productivity, animal welfare and the sustainability of milk production. Streptococcus uberis is the major cause of bovine mastitis in the UK. In contrast to other mastitis pathogens, S. uberis does not stimulate an innate response from epithelial tissues; initial recognition of infection is via macrophages found within milk. Paradoxically, triggering this defence response promotes bacterial colonisation. Challenge studies with S. uberis in dairy cattle have indicated the importance of a bacterial cell surface serine protease (SUB1154). This protein is essential for high level colonisation. Initial investigation indicated that this protein activated the NLRP3 inflammasome in bovine mammary macrophages resulting in the release of IL -1 (cytokine indicative of NLRP3 activation). The aim of this project is to determine the role of the SUB1154 protein in the inflammasomal pathway. Bovine mammary macrophages isolated from milk we re challenged with heat -killed strains of S. uberis and/or purified SUB1154. In the absence of SUB1154, IL -1 is not produced, but production of IL-1 was restored following supplementation with the purified protein, indicating the importance of SUB1154 in the NLRP3 inflammasomal pathway. Current analysis IL Omar S. Qureshi2 1Neuropharmacology Research Group, Institute of Clinical Sciences, University of Birmingham, UK; 2Celentyx Ltd, Birmingham, UK; 3Department of Neuroscience and Behaviour, Division of Psychiatry, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil; 4Population Health Science, B ristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK; 5Institute for Mental Health, School of Psychology, University of Birmingham, UK Designing suitable biomarker assays to evaluate target engagement of therapeutic agents supports hypothesis testing in clinical trials. As an example, we have used phospho flow cytometry to investigate the phosphorylation of STAT3 in response to the inflammatory cytokine IL -6 across various human immune cell subsets including CD4 and CD8 T cells, NK and NK differentially induced phospho -STAT3 across immune subsets. We have used this assay to compare two therapeutic agents targeting the IL -6 pathway, tocilizumab and ruxolitinib. Tocilizumab blocks IL -6 signaling at the IL -6 eptor whereas ruxolitinib IL -6- evoked STAT3 phosphorylation through inhibition of JAK1/2. We compare and contrast the sensitivity of human immune cell subsets to these two inhibitors by measuring the induction of STAT3 phosphorylation by a 'low' a of IL -6. On-going studies are utilising this approach to investigate the nature of IL -6 signaling in health and disease. P.04 Effect of GM -CSF on the immune response of human monocytes against C. albicans Khawalah Abid Munshi , Dan Singh, Darryl Miguel Camara, Martinez -Pomares University of Nottingham , UK colony -stimulating factor (GM -CSF) is a cytokine known for its role in regulating inflammation during fungal infections. GM -CSF can promote survival, adhesion and movement of immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophi ls and increases antifungal activity during infections, by promoting production of reactive oxygen species, phagocytosis, and cytokine secretion. This research aims to study the interaction between human inflammatory monocytes and C. albicans, focusing on the role of C -type lectin receptors (CLRs). CLRs have been implicated in fungal recognition by binding components of the fungal cell wall. We hypothesize that by investigating GM -CSF-driven changes in monocytes during C. albicans infection, we will unveil novel biological processes implicated in protection against infection. These findings will inform on the suitability of GM -CSF as a therapeutic agent against fungi. We have established an infection assay in which GM -CSF-treated monocytes are exposed to C. albicans using monocytes treated with macrophage colony -stimulating factor (M -CSF) as controls. GM -CSF-monocytes upregulate the Dectin -1 and compared to -CSF-monocytes. They also display enhanced phagocytic activity against zymosan. We expose GM -CSF and M -CSF-monocytes to C. albicans (strain CS -5314) (MOI=1, 37oC, in the presence of human serum) for 1 and 3 h. These conditions promote hyphae formation hence monocytes are exposed to C. albicans dis playing a major virulence attribute. Read outs include CFUs, cytokine production and microscopic examination. CFU were reduced dramatically during the assay at 1 and 3 h in the presence and absence of monocytes with a slight increased when monocytes (GM -CSF or M - CSF-treated) are present. GM -CSF promotes secretion of TNF -, IL -6 and IL -1 in response to infection with some TNF - already produced by uninfected GM -CSF-monocytes. Preliminary image analysis confirmed rapid hyphae formation during infection to ge nerate a long hypha after 3 h in the absence of monocytes. Importantly, presence of monocytes reduced hyphae formation, with this effect being more evident in the case of GM -CSF-treated cells. Further work aims to further characterise the impact of GM -CSF on monocyte responses to C. albicans infection and the contribution of specific signalling pathways to these responses. P.05 A family -wide assessment of latent STAT transcription factor interactions reveals divergent Trent University , UK The conversion of STAT proteins from latent to active transcription factors is central to cytokine signalling. Triggered by t heir signal -induced tyrosine phosphorylation, it is the assembly of a range of cytokine -specific STAT homo - and heterodimers that marks a key step in the transition of hitherto latent proteins to transcription activators. In contrast, the constitutive self -assembly of latent STATs and how it relates to the functioning of activated STATs, is understood less well. To provide a more complete picture, we developed a co -localization -based assay and tested all 28 possible combinations of the seven unphosphorylate d STAT (U -STAT) proteins in living cells. We identified five U -STAT STAT5A:STAT5B and performed semi -quantitative assessments of the forces and characterizations of binding interfaces that support them. One STAT protein STAT6 was found to be monomeric. This comprehensive analysis of latent STAT self -assembly lays bare considerable structural and functional diversity in the ways that link STAT dimerization before and after activation. P.06 Exploring Affinity -Dependent Metabolic Imprinting of Anti Gudgeon, Sarah Dimeloe, Heather Long University of Birmingham, UK T cell responses to viral infections are mediat ed by their recognition of specific viral peptide -MHC complexes by the T cell receptor (TCR). T cell functions are underpinned by changes in metabolism in response to TCR ligation, whereby the metabolic network is reprogrammed to meet the demands of the ce ll and support cell survival and growth. This project is focused on Epstein -Barr virus (EBV) antigen -specific T cells; primary EBV infection affects over 90% of the worldwide population and in some individuals, long -term carriage of EBV infection is associ ated with the development of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), numerous cancer types (eg. endemic Burkitt's lymphoma) and lymphoproliferative diseases. To investigate the immune profiles and metabolism of EBV antigen -specific T cells, preliminary experiments have assessed the HLA type of healthy donors and detected EBV antigen -specific T cells using peptide -MHC combined with metabolic probe staining, to assess mitochondrial mass and membrane potential, as well as fatty acid uptake. Tetramer staining has also been combined with SCENITH analysis, to explore the dependence of cells on certain metabolic pathways. This project aims to explore the relationship between TCR binding affinity and the phenotype of EBV-spec ific T cells. Therefore, going forward, peptide -specific T cells will be expanded in vitro, to generate T cell clones with unique TCRs and of different affinities for further metabolic exploration. P.07 Hypoxia impairs CD8+ T A, Gudgeon E, Stavrou V, Maslowski KM, Bending DA, Tennant D and Dimeloe S University of Birmingham, UK Introduction Hypoxia in the tumour microenvironment (TME) may drive immunosuppression and progre ssion of disease. We describe CD8+ T cell anti -tumour function in hypoxia by analysing immune functions, metabolism, and signalling pathways, and interrogating underlying mechanisms. Methods CD8+ T cells isolated from human peripheral blood are incubated o vernight in normoxia (21% oxygen) or hypoxia (1% oxygen) to allow oxygen level equilibration. Subsequently, cells are activated by anti -CD3/anti -CD28 antibodies and analysed. Results CD8+ T cells stimulated under hypoxia demonstrate impaired T cell activa tion (CD25 expression) and profound suppression of IFN - not TNF - . Granzyme -B expression, CD107a externalisation, and tumour cell killing are also unaffected by hypoxia indicating distinct effects on specific T cell functions. A defect in CD2 8, but not T cell receptor signalling, is observed in hypoxia, accompanied by reduced NFAT translocation to the nucleus. This signalling defect lies at the level of mTOR with impact on downstream targets. Analysis of distinct CD8+ T cell subpopulations con firmed hypoxia impacts all to a similar extent, including memory populations that encounter antigen in the hypoxic TME. Stable isotope -based metabolic tracing identified that activation -induced increases in glycolysis, glucose oxidation, and glutaminolysis are reduced in hypoxic vs. normoxic cells - consistent with impaired mTOR activity - which may underpin their impaired effector function. Conclusion Hypoxia impairs CD8+ T cell signalling, activation and specific effector functions. This occurs alongside diminished metabolic reprogramming upon activation. Further work will interrogate the mechanistic basis of mTOR suppression and interrogate activity of these pathways within patient tumour samples from hypoxic non -typable influenzae in older is associated with reduced CD36 expression Kylie Belchamber , Aaron Scott, Elizabeth Sapey University of Birmingham, UK Advanced age is a risk factor for pulmonary infections, which are the leading cause of death in older adults. The mechanism behind increased susceptibility to infection is poorly understood, but changes in macrophage function, including phagocytosis, due t o inflammageing may be implicated. Monocyte derived macrophages (MDM) from healthy young adults (<35 years) and non -frail older adults (>65 years, frailty score 1 -3) were exposed to measured by flow cytometry, alongside co -current expression of receptors CD36, TLR2 and TLR4. MDM phagocytosis of NTHI was significantly reduced in older adult s compared to young (61% vs. 33%, p<0.05). Phagocytosis of SP, and efferocytosis of AN was not changed. Baseline CD36 expression was significantly reduced in older vs. young adults (60% vs. 29%, p<0.05). In older adults, MDM phagocytosis of expression compared to baseline (47% vs. 29%, p<0.05) but remained significantly decreased compared to young adults (47% vs. 70%, p<0.05), whereas phagocytosis of SP (p<0.05) and efferocytosis of AN (p<0.01) increased CD36 expression to that of younge r adults. There was no change in expression of TLR2 or TLR4. Impaired phagocytosis of NTHI by older adult macrophages is associated with impaired ability to elevate CD36 expression. CD36 forms heterodimers with TLR2 and TLR4 to aid LPS recognition, and trigger signalling cascades. Thus, impaired CD36 regulation presents a mechanism for dysregulated NHTI phagocytosis in older adults, which may be targeted as a novel therapy for age -related infections. P.09 Therapeutic potential of a multi -tumour antigen ptide for Stephanie McArdle1 Research Centre, Nottingham Trent University, UK; 2Center for Vaccine Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark Glioblastoma (GBM), advanced prostate cancer (PCa) and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) have poor survival rates and limited treatments. Targeting residual tumour cells following treatment can prove crucial to avoid recurrence, with vaccines representi ng an appealing strategy due to their potential to engage the immune system. Cancer/testis antigens HAGE and NY -ESO-1 as well as tumour antigen WT1 are promising candidates for vaccine development; their expression can be upregulated by low dose decitabine (DAC) treatment, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. In addition, the novel adjuvant CAF\u00ae09b can induce CD8+ T cell responses against these antigens. A panel of human GBM, PCa and TNBC cell lines was treated with DAC and tested for these antigens using qPC R and western blot. TNBC tissue microarrays the 3 (IHC). sequences derived from these antigens were combined with CAF\u00ae09b and used for the immunisation of HHDII/DR1 mice. Antigen -derived peptides were tested for immunogenicity using an IFNg ELISpot assay and antigenic activation of T cells from blood was assessed by flow cytometry using pentamer staining. The expression of the 3 antigens in GBM, PCa and TNBC cell lines indicated that low -dose DAC t reatment induced antigen upregulation at the transcript and protein levels. IHC staining of human TNBC confirmed the expression of the antigens. The splenocytes derived from CAF\u00ae09b -adjuvanted HAGE/NY r esponses, and the pentamer -stained blood suggested the presence of antigen -activated CD8+ T cells. Our vaccine is therefore a good candidate for vaccine development with clinical potential. P.10 Therapeutic efficacy of a prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) d erived peptide -based vaccine administered with CAF\u00ae09b adjuvant tested Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent Univer sity, Nottingham, UK; 2Department Copenhagen, Denmark Sipuleucel -T, the only available FDA approved vaccine for advanced prostate cancer has extended the overall survival of the patients by 4.1 mon ths, but it remains expensive and only available in the US. Dr. McArdle et al group has identified and patented a mutated PAP -derived 42 (MutPAP42mer) amino -acid long sequence. The immunological properties of this PAP derived 42mer peptide together with a 15 AA long PAP derived sequence (PAP15mer) was investigated in two mouse models, HHDII/DR1 and C57BL/6 mice with the use of novel cationic liposomal adjuvant CAF\u00ae09b. Vaccine specific immune responses were measured by ELISPOT assay. CD3+ T cells were isola ted from splenocytes, stimulated ex -vivo with IL2 and PAP peptides and were co -cultured with PCa cell lines to assess cytotoxic capability by using 'CCK -8 Cell counting kit'. Results obtained so far confirm the immunogenicity and in -vitro cytotoxic efficac y of Mut PAP42mer vaccine using CAF\u00ae09 as an adjuvant. Mut 42mer vaccine could induce CD8+ and CD4+ specific responses and the vaccine specific T cells were able to recognise and kill PCa target cell lines in -vitro. Presence of PCa associated MDSCs were al so identified. Immunosuppressive nature of TME associated with PCa, makes immunotherapies less effective in treating PCa. MutPAP42mer/CAF\u00ae09 is both immunogenic and able to generate T -cells capable of recognising and killing PAP -expressing targets. We will also assess wether blocking B2 adrenergic receptor mediated signalling along with PAP -derived 42mer peptide with CAF\u00aeO9 vaccine impact the growth of TRAMP -C2 cells injected into C57BL/6 mice. P.11 Engineering amino acid uptake promotes CAR T adaption the and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, UK ; 2Institute of Cancer and Genomics, University of Birmingham, UK; 3J-Pharma Co. Ltd, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan ; 4School of Sport, Exercise and Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Birmingham, UK Cancer cells take up amino acids from the extracellular space to drive cell proliferation and viability. Similar mechanisms are applied by immune cells, resulting in the competition between conventional T cells, or indeed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and tumour cells, for the limited availability of amino acids within the environment. We demonstrate that T cells can be re -engineered to express SLC7A5 or SLC7A11 transmembrane amino acid transporters alongside CARs. Transporter modifications increase CAR T -cell proliferation under low tryptophan or cystine conditions with no loss of CAR cytotoxicity or increased exhau stion. The adaptation of CAR -T to tumour environment, results in an increase of the AML clearance in murine models. Transcriptomic and phenotypic analysis reveals downstream, SLC7A5/SLC7A11 -modified CAR T cells upregulate intracellular arginase expression and activity. Thus, CAR T cells can be adapted to the amino acid metabolic microenvironment of cancer, a hitherto recognized but unaddressed barrier for successful CAR T -cell therapy. P.12 Re-wiring of TCR signalling pathways during CD 8 T cell exhaustion Thomas Elliot , David Bending University of Birmingham , UK Expression of Nr4a family genes is a biomarker of TCR engagement, and fluorescent reporters of Nr4a gene expression can be used to track TCR signals. Comparative analysis of Nr4 a1 and Nr4a3 reporter systems has revealed differential regulation by signalling pathways that diverge downstream of the TCR. Nr4a1 expression, which is independent of NFAT signalling, is responsive to low strength signals such as positive selection in the thymus and tonic self -antigen recognition in the spleen. In contrast, NFAT dependent Nr4a3 expression requires stronger TCR signals. We utilised sub -cutaneous injection of MC38 carcinoma cells to model chronic antigen recognition in the tumour microenviro nment. Whilst antigen specific CD8 TILs do express Nr4a1 during early stages of tumour development, it is shut down by day 13. This is associated with a concurrent up -regulation of negative regulators of TCR signalling such as PD -1 and CD39. Nr4a1 expressi on was restricted in SLAMF6 - TIM-3+ exhausted CD8 T cells and SLAMF6+ TIM -3- stem -like CD8 T cells. Nr4a1 expression was unaltered by blockade of PD -L1 and injection of anti -CD3 only drove Nr4a1 expression in a small subset of cells. In contrast to Nr4a1, Nr4a3 expression is maintained in CD8 TILs. This suggests that chronically stimulated CD8 T cells can sustain NFAT signalling whilst shutting down other pathways. In vitro chronic stimulation of purified CD8 T cells demonstrated typical features of exhaustion, and re - capitulated reduced Nr4a1 expression. P.13 Preventing graft -versus -host disease Elif Yildiz, Renad Immunology a nd Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, UK Background:Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) have been shown to play a central role in immune tolerance and the suppression of transplant rejection. Redirecting the specificity of Treg to alloantigen may enhan ce their therapeutic potential, however, the persistent presence of alloantigen may lead to Treg exhaustion/deletion. Therefore, we propose that generating Treg that recognise exogenous molecules may limit the timeframe and site of activation which may lim it the aforementioned caveats of this approach. Methods: Murine splenic Treg were isolated and expanded with anti -CD3/CD28 beads in the presence IL -2 and TGF in vitro. A viral vector containing the rearranged V14 and V7 chains of an iNKT T cell TCR was generated and used to retrovirally transduce expanded Treg on day 2; the transduction efficiency was determined by flow cytometry and the suppressive capacity of such Treg was evaluated using a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) in vitro. Results:We found t hat Treg cultured with beads and IL -2/TGF underwent significant expansion with limited contaminant cells. Additionally, expanded Treg were receptive to transduction as 60% expressed a functional iNKT TCR compared to mock transduced Treg after 7 days. More over, purified transduced Treg were able to suppress alloreactive T cell proliferation and expansion in the presence of GalCer -CD1d. Conclusion:Taken together, we have shown that Treg can be retrovirally -transduced with an iNKT TCR that re -directs speci ficity to glycolipid/CD1d and increases suppression ability. Therefore, this study suggests that redirecting the specificity of Treg to known antigens may enhance the ability of such cells to control allograft rejection, GVHD and autoimmunity.

P.16 Application of Tg4 Nur77 -Tempo mice to identify effective immunotherapy combinations Emma K Jennings , Lozan Sheriff and David Bending Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham , UK Nur77, part of the Nr4a receptor family, reporter mice are valuable tools for studying T cell receptor (TCR) signalling. Nur77 is activated by TCR signal ling and plays key roles in T cell differentiation. We have previously reported, using a GFP reporter system, that Nur77 is highly sensitive to TCR signalling, making it a key model to explore moderate T cell responses. Utilising our recently developed Nu r77-Timer rapidly expressed in lymphocytes (Tempo) reporter mice, we have further explored the dynamics of Nur77 expression following in vivo TCR stimulation of Tg4 Nur77 -Tempo mice with of 4Y analysis, we investigated Nur77 -Tempo dynamics as well as expression of membrane receptors associated with strong TCR signals (ICOS and OX40) in our system. We explore the effects of agonistic and inhibitory checkpoint modulation prior to peptide restimulation, both in vivo and in vitro. Our data using Nur77 -Tempo mice has revealed that anti -PD-L1 therapy leads to increased TCR signal strength during re -challenge. In addition, we create a nove l in vivo/in vitro hybrid platform to screen for potential effective immunotherapy combinations that boost T cell activation. We show, using the Tg4 Nur77 -Tempo model, that Nur77 -Tempo mice are a powerful tool for studying T cell responses to a wide range of TCR signal strengths. In addition, we show that Nur77 expression increases proportionally with the dose of peptide rechallenge received, with PD -L1 therapy augmenting T the immune landscape: Optimising the multiplex immunohistochemistry images of Tissue -Resident Memory T cell in Breast Cancer Qianya Xu , Judith Ramage, Andrew Jackson, Shakhnoza Jumaniyazova, Zhiyuan Cheng University of Nottingham, UK Background: Tissue -resident memory T cell (TRM) have been described as tissue resident non - circulating memory T cells. The TRM gene signature has been shown to be a favourable prognostic marker in triple -negative breast cancer (TNBC) in study using sin gle-cell . upregulated on -cells upon TCR stimulation. Futhermore, CD8+CD39+CD103+ has been shown to define activated tissue resident CD8 T -cells. The aim of this study was to optimise a panel of antibodies for multipl ex fluorescence immunohistochemistry(mIHC) to study the composition and spatial location of TRM in tumours from 2000 breast cancer patients. Method: A panel of 6 antibodies and DAPI TRM markers, while pan -cytokeratin was used as a marker for tumour epithelium. Results: Our mIHC optimising result showed the ideal condition for each marker. Phenotype subtypes can be divided into single -positive, double -positive, triple -positive, and negative -staine d cells detected in both intra -epithelial and intra -stromal in breast cancer tissue microarray using Inform software (machine learning). Conclusion: This research indicated an optimal condition of the mIHC stain for Nottingham breast cancer, which will be applied for staining a tissue microarray containing tumour cores from 2000 breast cancer patients. in Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Respiratory Sciences, University of Leicester, UK; 2NIHR Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, Glenfield Leicester NHS Trust, Leicester , UK; 3National College, London , UK; 4Department of Respiratory Medicine, Glenfield Hospital, University Hospitals of Leicester, UK Rationale: Peripheral blood leukocyte characteristics are poorly understood in p atients with Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA), a rare disease whereby blood and tissue eosinophilia feature. Objectives: We wanted to measure the absolute counts of leukocytes in the blood of EGPA patients, specifically granulocytes (eo sinophils, neutrophils, basophils), cells Lymphoid cells (ILC2s)) and T cell subsets (T1, 2, 17). We also wanted to asses eosinophil activation status at baseline. Methods: Lithium -heparin whole blood was collected from stab le EGPA patients (n=5) and healthy volunteers (n=9). Leukocyte populations were measured using cytometry. Absolute cell counts are presented per 100uL. Activation status was measured using CD11a/CD18, with results presented as a ratio to FMO control, with a low ratio meaning less activation. EGPA patients were on continued benralizumab, mepolizumab and/or oral steroid at time of blood collection. Results: Granulocyte counts were similar between EGPA and health. ILC2 and B cell counts were significantly lowe r in EGPA compared to health (p=0.027 and p=0.019 respectively). All T helper (Th) and cytotoxic T (Tc) cell subsets were similar, however Th17 cells counts were significantly lower in EGPA than in health (p=0.017). Baseline eosinophil activation in health y donors was bimodally distributed. Eosinophil activation in EGPA was similar to lowly activated eosinophils in health (p=0.083). Conclusion: ILC2, B and Th17 cells are decreased in EGPA patients compared to health. There is heterogeneity present in eosi nophil activation between healthy donors, which warrants further investigation to establish biological and clinical relevance. P.19 Defining the surface proteome of 1School of Biosciences, Health and Life Sciences, Aston University, UK ; 2Aston Centre for Membrane Proteins and Lipids Research (AMPL), Aston University, UK ; 3NanoFCM Co. Ltd, D6 Thane Road, Nottingham, UK As cells die in vivo they a re removed by phagocytes in a process that resolves inflammation and prevents disease. For clearance of dying (apoptotic) cells to be efficient and timely, dying cells release extracellular vesicles (EV) to attract phagocytes to sites of cell death. Crucia lly, this interaction of EV with the immune system underpins the control of inflammation, a process central to health, regenerative medicine and many inflammatory diseases. Multiparametric single -EV analysis is a next generation approach enabling in -depth characterisation and identification of novel EV subpopulations. A significant challenge, however, is EV heterogeneity. In particular, EV vary greatly in size (<50nm - >1\u00b5m). NanoFCM have developed a novel platform that combines the capabilities of flow cyt ometry at the nano -scale with high sensitivity (40nm limit of scatter detection) and specificity (simultaneous scatter and fluorescence detection). This will enable comprehensive EV phenotyping at a scale that has previously been difficult to detect. Throu gh collaboration between Aston University and NanoFCM, the EV surface will be probed at high resolution to establish a fundamental atlas of the surface proteome of apoptotic cell -derived EVs (ACdEVs) across the entire size range. ACdEV surface proteome wil l be linked to function as we address the following key questions: what are the key components of ACdEV that enable communication with the immune system? Do ACdEV of differing sizes and sources interact in a similar manner with the immune system? Is it pos sible to produce a synthetic ACdEV with a defined surface proteome to mimic of ACdEV function? P.20 Increased IEL expansion following Salmonella infection in -deficient mice Scarfe L. , Mackie G. M., Copland A., Maslowski M. University of Birmingham, UK Maintenance of intestinal integrity is dependent on crosstalk between epithelial, stromal and immune cells and the gut microbiota. Nod -like (NLR) apoptosis inhibitory proteins NLRC4 upon recognition of gram -negative bacteria, leading to pyroptosis/apoptosis, intestinal epithelial cell expulsion and release of IL -1, IL -18 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). This is essential to limit bacterial dissemin ation, with NAIP KO mice experiencing gut epithelial barrier collapse four days after Salmonella infection, driven by TNF release. NAIPs also appear to have homeostatic roles within the intestinal epithelium, as our group has previously shown that NAIPs su ppress colonic tumourigenesis but enhance colonic inflammation. We aimed to further understand the role of NAIPs on the intraepithelial lymphocyte compartment during infection with Salmonella Typhimuirum. Following Salmonella infection, NAIP KO mice had in creased numbers of TCRCD8 and TCR+ intraepithelial lymphocytes, suggesting a possible source of TNF during barrier collapse. This effect may be driven by the increased bacterial burden in colon and mesenteric lymph node tissue we observed in NAIP KO mice. Using colonic organoids, we have also identified altered basal levels of prostaglandins (PGF2) and IL -15/IL -15R complex, which could explain altered IEC proliferation and survival. Our ongoing studies aim to further evaluate the mechanisms and impac t on mucosal immunity in response to inflammatory challenge. P.21 Fancy a cigarette? Addressing the need of an ethically sound mouse model to define the immunopathophysiological mechanisms of cigarette smoke -induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Laura Bartlett1, David Onion1, Paddy Tighe1, Adam Watkins2, Lucy Fairclough1 1School of Life Sciences, University of Nottingham, UK ; 2School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, UK Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a long -term and pr ogressive respiratory condition most frequently caused by chronic cigarette smoking and characterised by marked pulmonary and systemic inflammation. As a disease, COPD places a significant burden on global medical and economic resources, and treatment revo lves largely around symptom management and intervention during exacerbations. Murine models are frequently used to investigate key immunopathogenic mechanisms driving disease, yet despite being a topic of significant focus, findings from animal models are limited in their scope due to limited investigative techniques. As such our understanding of the role of immunity in COPD pathogenesis and persistence is relatively insufficient, and in addition most current models do not actively reflect human disease or the three Rs of animal research: replacement, refinement and reduction. Our research group therefore aims to develop a novel 3Rs friendly murine model of COPD using an intranasal cigarette smoke extract (CSE) exposure method to investigate the role of pulm onary and systemic inflammation on COPD pathogenesis. We have developed and validated an extensive 24 marker spectral flow panel and 18 gene RT -qPCR panel to thoroughly investigate the phenotypes and effector functions of numerous immune cell types and inf lammatory genes known to play a role in COPD pathophysiology. Here we describe the step -by-step processes utilised and challenges faced to develop and validate the investigative techniques used for the model, as well as current findings from the beginning of our pilot study. P.22 Therapeutic STmaroA preferentially invade proliferating cells in typhimurium home to and colonise tumours, where it induces tumour regression via mechanisms including metabolic competition, reducing tumour stemness and inducing an immune response. In this study, we aimed to further understand the mechanism by which attenuated STm specifically target tumour stem cells. Using a range of invasion machinery - deficient STm, coupled with pharmacological inhibitors, we identify type -3 secretion system component SipB engagement with host membrane chole sterol as essential for intracellular invasion of STm into tumour organoids. Previous studies have shown that cell -surface cholesterol is maximal during mitosis, and we show that STm preferentially invade ki67+ cells and blockade of proliferation invasion. Although SipB -deficient STm cannot sipB -deficient STM into Apcmin/+ mice led to colonisation of polyps, and thus still have the potential to affect tumour metabolic landscape and immune inf iltration. Bulk RNA -sequencing patient -derived and mouse tumour organoids infected with STmaroA or STmaroA in combination with a cholesterol -sequestering compound allowed comparison of extracellular and intracellular bacteria on tumours in vitro. Intr acellular infection led to upregulation of a range of chemokines and innate pathways, whereas extracellular bacteria induced enrichment of genes involved in metabolic pathways, which may drive differential immune responses in vivo. We propose that preferen tial invasion of fast -dividing cancer stem cells by Salmonella via SipB\u00ac -cholesterol interaction diminishes the stem cell pool within the tumour, as well as altered chemokine production. We next aim to identify to what extent intracellular invasion is need ed for therapeutic efficacy. P.23 Exploiting immune cells by Multiplex to improve the Immune score in colorectal cancer Zhiyuan Cheng , Shakhnoza Jumaniyazova, Mohammad Ilyas and Judith M Ramag e University of Nottingham, UK Background: Immunoscore is a long -tested classification system for colorectal cancer (CRC), which relies on quantification of CD3/CD8 infiltration in tumor or invasive margin. However, this system only exploits 4 four paramet ers (two proteins, two tissue regions) to build classification due to the limitation of Immunohistochemistry so that other immune cells contribute to tumor immune network (such as macrophages, T help cells) have been ignored and tissue regions are limited. This study aims to define the immune neighborhoods and link these with patient's prognosis. Method: Six different antibodies CD68, used for multiplex in 4000 tissue microarray (TMA) cores of 1000 CRC patients, which relies on Akoya multiplex kit/Leica Novolink detection system and Akoya Fusion platform. Akoya Inform was chosen as the machine learning software for tissue/cell segmentation and phenotype identification. The cytomap was used for unsupervised cluster and R for other bioinformatic analysis. All bioinformatics results will be evaluated based on clinical data of CRC. Result and Conclusion: CD4+, CD8+, and CD68+ cells positively correlate with CRC patient survival. Unsupervised cluster reveals several clearly distinguished clusters in different CRC patients by combing CD34, epithelial cell adhesion molecule and MHC -II with immune cells together, which could possibly explain comprehensive immune network in CRC. P.24 Long -chain fatty aci d uptake from the bone marrow microenvironment suppresses T cell function in Multiple Myeloma Gudgeon Hospital, Wolverhampton , UK Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a plasma B cell mal ignancy that develops in the bone marrow (BM) and is preceded by the asymptomatic condition monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Despite observations that T cell function is dysregulated in MM, checkpoint blockade therapies have not b een successful, indicating that alternative mechanisms operate in the BM microenvironment to suppress T cell activity. Here, we assessed T cell phenotype, function and metabolism in matched peripheral blood (PB) and BM samples from healthy aged -matched don ors and across the spectrum of MM disease progression. We identify that BM CD8+ T cell abundance and cytokine expression decrease with MM development, and furthermore, that CD8+ T cell function is consistently impaired within BM samples compared to matched PB, confirming suppression within the BM microenvironment. These changes were accompanied by decreased mitochondrial mass and an elevated capacity of T cells to take up long -chain fatty acids. In vitro approaches confirmed that uptake of BM lipids reduces BM CD8+ T cell mitochondrial mass and supresses cytokine expression, which were decreased by culture in autologous BM plasma but rescued by lipid removal. This work gives new insight into the pathology of MM disease and suggests new ways to restore T cell function of MM bone marrow. P.25 Optimising the multiplex immunohistochemistry images of macrophages (TAMs) are one of the most abundant immune components in breast cancer (BC). The current understanding of the heterogeneity of phenotypic manifest ations of different macrophage subpopulations indicates the need for simultaneous assessment of several specific macrophage markers, which increases the accuracy of identifying a particular macrophage subpopulation. This would allow us to identify novel pr ognostic and predictive markers of cancer. Compared to Caucasian breast cancer patients, African women present with notoriously more aggressive breast cancer tumours, at a younger age, with diagnosis at a later stage and with a large number of triple -negat ive cases. These factors result in a higher mortality rate. However, despite the higher mortality rate, immune infiltration of African women's breast cancers is poorly studied. Method. We use a Breast cancer TMA assembled from Ghanaian women, an African p opulation to describe the development and optimisation of a seven FFPE tissue. Results. We identified many factors that influenced the quality of the acquired imag es. Macrophage subtypes can be divided into single -positive, double -positive, and negative -stained cells detected in both intra -epithelial and intra -stromal in BC. Conclusion. This research indicated an optimal condition of the m stain for Nottingham and African BC, which will be applied for staining a TMA containing tumour cores from 2000 BC patients for Nottingham and 400 African BC patients. Then, the clinicopathological data from both the African and Nottingham cohorts will be compared. P.26 Maternal Vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae leads to long -lasting immunity to offspring Jamie Matthew Darby2, Alisha Chetty2, Adam Cunningham3, William Horsnell1,2 1Institute of Microbiology and Infection, Collage of Medical and Dental Sciences , University of Birmingham , UK; 2Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Division of Immunology, University of Cape Town , South Africa; 3Institute of Infectious Disease and Immunotherapy, Collage of Medical and Dental Sciences, University o f Birmingham , UK Maternal Vaccination to provide protection to the unborn infant is an attractive way to prevent infections in the early weeks and months of life. Despite this, the efficacy or mechanisms underpinning this approach are not well studied. The leading cause of child mortality by infection worldwide is Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), particularly in low -to-middle -income countries (LMIC). This prevalence of infection could be due to vaccines (e.g. Prevnar13 (PCV13)) not being administered until the infant is 8 weeks old. Therefore, in children there is a window of susceptibility to this infection that could be addressed through maternal vaccination. We have used novel mouse models of maternal vaccination (MV) with PCV13 and ch allenges using pneumococcus to identify the features of acquired immunity. Maternally vaccinated (MV'd) offspring acquired surprisingly long -lasting antibody responses as well as reduced bacterial burdens in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), lung and bloo d suggesting protection against invasive pneumococcal disease is present. Moreover, MV'd offspring have distinct immune signatures associated with increase maternal cell populations. MV'd offspring display distinct enhanced levels of immune control in the BAL, increased maternal B and plasma cell populations in the lung and bone marrow as well as bone marrow cells that secrete PCV13 -specific antibodies. Therefore, MV suggests long -lasting immunity to infection and potentially has discrete impacts on host i mmune homeostasis. P.27 NRK1 fine species abundance during CD4+ T cell activation to regulate their function and exhaustion Victoria Stavrou , Nancy Gudgeon, Myah Ali, Emma Bishop, Taylor Fulton ca Mann, Adam Boufersaoui, Jennie Roberts, Silke Heising, Gareth Lavery and Sarah Dimeloe University of Birmingham, UK Activation of CD4+ T cells drives transcriptional and translational changes, accompanied by key metabolic redox co -factors supporting this, and are linked to abundance of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH), through activity of the pentose phosphate pathway(PPP), which couples NADP/H oxidation to GSH/GSSG reduction. NAD can be synthesised de novo or salvaged from nicotinamide (NAM), (NMN), by NAM phosphoribosyl to NMN, thereby directing it into the salvage pathway. Contribution of NRK1 to NAD(P)/H synthesis in T cells and its role in their biology has not yet been studied. We obser ve NRK1 is upregulated in human and murine CD4+ T cells upon activation. In human cells, this is TCR - and CD28 -dependent and requires ERK, NFAT, SRK, Pi3K and Akt activity. Provision of human CD4+ T cells with exogenous NR increases NAD/H and NADP/H as exp ected, particularly is However, surprisingly, NR treatment of NAMPT -competent cells suppresses rather than supports cytokine secretion and prevents exhaustion. Consistently, CD4+ T cells from NRK1 -deficient mice demonstrate decreased NAD/H abundance but increased activation and cytokine secretion vs. WT cells. T cell cytokine suppression by NR was associated with decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) abundance, whilst NRK1 -KO CD4+ T cells demonstrate increased ROS, alongside decrease d GSH/GSSG ratios. Taken together, the data suggest NRK1 activity in CD4+ T cells \"tops up\" NAD(P)/H levels generated by NAMPT to maintain optimal GSH abundance and control of ROS. In its absence, increased ROS signalling promotes T cell activation, cytoki ne secretion and exhaustion. Consistent with this, PPP inhibition prevents suppression of IFN - by NR. P.28 -cell responses Kawakami2, David Bending1 and Rebecca Drummond1 1University of Birmingham, UK ; 2Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan The recruitment and activation of CD4 T -cells within the CNS during infection is only partially understood. We have used a model of cryptococcal meningitis, a lethal fungal neurological infection that is dependent on CD4 T -cells for protection, to delineate the cell populations and events regulating entry of CD4 T -cells to the fungal -infected brain. We developed a novel TCR tr ansgenic mouse model (CnTII -Tocky) to analyze anti -fungal CD4 T -cell responses and the role of myeloid cells in these responses. This model reports Nr4a3 -dependent TCR signaling activity and cytokine production of Cryptococcus -specific CD4 T -cells during i n vivo infection, enabling us to correlate T - cell numbers, proliferation, fungal burden, TCR signaling and cytokine production in the same animal. Using these mice, we show that fungal -specific CD4 T -cells only migrate into the CNS during acute meningitis but not chronic infection. Infiltrating CD4 T -cells had undergone rounds of division, produced IFN and did not engage their TCR as they expressed low TCR and reduced Nr4a3 - dependent TCR signaling. Acute meningitis induced high numbers of inflammatory CX CL10+ macrophages. Single -cell RNA -seq analysis of macrophages revealed significant heterogeneity however antigen presentation and T -cell engagement pathways were largely localized to one population that shared characteristics with border macrophages. In c ontrast, CNS -resident microglia did not significantly upregulate genes involved with T -cell activation and appeared relatively unchanged in both acute and chronic CNS infection models. Taken together, our results show that monocyte -derived macrophages infi ltrate the CNS CXCL10 to recruit IFN -producing T -cells, which have limited TCR -dependent interactions with CNS -resident myeloid cells. In contrast, chronic infection suppresses the development of the macrophage population for CNS recruitment of T -cells. Taken together, we have delineated a complex series of events that regulate CD4 T -cells entry to the CNS during cryptococcal meningitis, revealing several novel targets for immune -based therapies for this life -threa tening infection. P.29 Immature granulocyte counts and red cell distribution width may be used to predict survival outcome in alcoholic hepatitis Reenam Shamim Khan1, Laura Lalor 1University of Birmingham, UK ; 2Liver Unit, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham , UK Introduction: Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is an acute inflammatory form of alcohol -related liver disease, with significant short -term mortality when severe. Prediction of which pa tients will do poorly remains a clinical challenge. In this study we use readily available automated haematology analysers to investigate whether blood cell parameters help in the diagnosis of AH, and can identify which patients have the highest short -term mortality risk. Methods: In this prospective study, blood samples were obtained from inpatients with alcoholic hepatitis (AH) (n=39), patients with alcohol -related liver cirrhosis, including abstinent patients (ALD - A) (n=39) and those that were actively d rinking (ALD -D) (n=11). Samples were run on the Sysmex -XN 1000 haematology analyser. Patient demographics and clinical outcomes (disease severity, as measured by the Glasgow Alcoholic Hepatitis Score (GAHS), and survival up to 1 year) was obtained from ele ctronic hospital records and compared to healthy controls (n=39). Results: Patients with AH had significantly elevated immature granulocyte (IG) counts, compared to HC (p<0.0001), ALD -A (p<0.0001) and ALD -D (p=0.04). AH patients also had increased red -cell distribution width (RCDW), compared to HC (p<0.0001), ALD -A (p<0.0001) and ALD -D (p=0.0040). In AH, IG counts and (r= 0.4323, p=0.0075 and r=0.6315, p<0.0001). Patients who died by 28 days follow up had significantly higher immature granulocyte counts (p<0.00001) and higher RCDW (p=0.008) than patients who survived. Conclusion: IG counts and RCDW, easily obtained on automated haematology analysers, help distinguish patients with AH and could identify patients at highest ris k of short term mortality to help inform clinical management strategies. P.30 Towards a B cell Vaccine for Tumour expressed Self -Antigens F. Escobar -Riquelme , M. Price, K -M Toellner, Y. Zhang University of Birmingham , UK Targeting tumour antigens is mayor challenge in cancer -immunotherapy. We try to use vaccination to induce antibodies targeting self -antigens expressed on tumour vessels. We have shown that a conjugate vaccine can induce autoantibodies specific to the tumour endothelial antigen Robo4, which is selectively expressed on tumour vascular endothelium, but not or low on healthy vasculature. By linking the extracellular domain of Robo4 to a common carrier protein, autoreactive B cells could recruit T cell help specific for the carrier. This pr otocol could efficiently induce specific anti-Robo4 antibodies and suppress tumour growth in a Lewis Lung carcinoma (LLC1) mouse model. This project aims to optimise the vaccine -induced antibody response to Robo4 in LLC1 tumours and understand how the vacc ine breaches immune tolerance in cancer. As most patients have pre -existing T cell memory to tetanus, we decided to use the non -toxic fragment C of tetanus toxin (TTc) as the carrier protein. Our data shows that vaccination of mice with Robo4 -TTc in adjuva nt can efficiently induce the production of Robo4 -specific antibodies, particularly IgG1. Moreover, the injection of Robo4 -TTc retarded the tumour growth in a LLC1 model. Further we discovered increase in NK cell, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell and dendritic cell populations in tumours after Robo4 vaccination. LLC1 is a non -inflamed, poorly immunogenic tumour, resistant to immune -checkpoint therapy (ICT). Our data indicate that this vaccination strategy may have potential to improve the results of cancer therapy for ICT-resistant \"cold\" tumours. Keywords: Cancer -immunotherapy, Vaccine, Robo4, Lung cancer. liver Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, UK SARS -CoV-2 is the coronavirus responsible for the 2020 COVID -19 pandemic, and commences infection in the human respiratory tract. We now appreciate that there are multiple anatomical sites that har bour infection beyond the lungs, causing significant pathology. During infection, features of transient liver damage have been reported, as measured by peripheral blood liver enzymes released by damaged hepatocytes. In most patients, liver injury resolves after recovery. However, the long - term impact of infection in the liver has not been investigated. Furthermore, it is suggested that SARS -CoV-2 infection may sensitise the liver for increased damage following other infections, such as adenovirus. To study the impact of SARS -CoV-2 variants of concern on liver pathobiology, we developed a high content immunofluorescence -based assay in hepatoma cell lines. Huh -7 and interferon pathway RIG -I deficient Huh -7.5 cells were characterised for susceptibility and perm issibility to the ancestral strain, and variants of concern Alpha, Delta, Omicron BA1 and Omicron BA2 that have been widely spread in the UK over the past three years. Our data showed that hepatoma cell lines were susceptible and supported SARS -CoV-2 repli cation despite less than those of human lung epithelial cell line A549 -ACE2 and the gold -standard cell line for coronavirus infection, Vero cells. This was explained by the low ACE2 receptor expression in the hepatoma cell lines. Overall, our model is suit able to study infection, syncytia formation and variant neutralisation in liver, lung, and kidney epithelial cells, and could be adapted to test emerging variants of SARS - CoV-2 in other human and non -human adherent cell lines.
