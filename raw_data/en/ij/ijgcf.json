To provide participants with information about the Cross Cultural Curriculum so that they can utilize the information and materials with tribal and federal personnel on their reservations. I 2. To introduce the curriculum and the individual modules and the most appropriate use of the materials. 3. To provide an overview of all sections of the curriculum so that federal I criminal justice personnel will gain a greater understanding of Native people and their culture and traditions. I I I I I I In recent years, federal employees have been working with Native American victims of crime in increasing numbers. In 1989, the Office for Victims began funding on-reservation programs through the Victim Assistance in Indian Country (VAIC) discretionary grant program. As increasing numbers of Indian victims of crime have come into the criminal justice system, U.S. Attorneys, Federal Victim/Witness Coordinators, FBI Agents, and other federal personnel who are predominantly non-Indian, have encountered cultural differences in working with Native American crime victims. This curriculum and video will present some of the realities of the delivery of services to Native victims by victim assistance programs with the goal of increasing understanding of how VAIC programs may differ from similar non- Indian programs. Any discussion of Native programs must begin with the caveat that all tribes are different and that there is no single correct way to deal with all Indian persons and/or programs. Non-Indian personnel working within Indian Country must educate themselves regarding the Indian Nations in their jurisdiction. An Overview of \"A Cross Cultural Curriculum for Federal Criminal Justice Personnel\" workshop is being offered on Wednesday, September 29, 1999, from 3:30 - 5:00 in the Oklahoma South Room Tulsa, Oklahoma 1999 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 7 th Indian Nations Conference I I I I Pre-Conference Institute September 27, 1999 i \"Introduction to the Children's Advocacy Center Model\" Teresa Cain and Roe Bubar, JD Learning Objectives: i 1. To increase understanding of the history, philosophy and benefits of the Children's Advocacy Center multidisciplinary approach to child abuse. 2. Identify the common program components of the CAC model, and explore the unique programmatic options that have been adopted by tribes to meet the needs of child victims of abuse in Indian Country. 3. Define what steps are commonly taken in moving from concept to reality in developing a multidisciplinary team and Child Advocacy Center. I I I I I I I I I This interactive session will provide information on how the Children's Advocacy Center multidisciplinary approach can help to meet the needs of child victims of abuse in Indian Country. Common program component of the CAC model will be identified, and the unique programmatic options that have been adopted by tribes will be explored. Steps commonly taken in moving from concept to reality in developing MDTs and CACs will be covered. A Children's Advocacy Center is a child-focused, facility-based program in which representatives from many disciplines meet to discuss and make decisions about investigation, treatment, and prosecution of child abuse cases. The multidisciplinary team approach brings together under one umbrella all the professionals and agencies needed to offer comprehensive services: law enforcement, child protective services, prosecution, mental health and the medical community. CACs are community-based programs designed by professionals and volunteers to meet the unique needs of a community and minimize the potential for revictimization of children. This comprehensive approach ensures that children receive child-focused services in a child-friendly environment - one in which the child's need come first!

Bavolek, Ph.D. (An adaptation) Definition: A physically abused child is o'ne who has received injuries from shaking, beating, striking, or burning. . ,! I I II I I Physical Indicators: You should consider the possibility of physical abuse when any of the following conditions exists. . The child shows evidence of ~eoeated ~njuTies. There are signs of new injuries before old injuries have healed (skin abrasions, fractures, etc.). . The historv is not c_R.D2u~%~I~ with ~. The way the child states how the injuries were received is not consistent with the type of injury (falling on the playground and bruises or welts on the legs or arms, or buttocks). . The ~ ~R~RI~ of ~ D a in. Internal injuries have developed which may be the result of punching, kicking, or hitting the child in the midsection. . . 2hl child has unexplained i/L~. The child refuses to state how the injury occurred or offers several contradictory explanations as to the origin of the injury. ~ ~ are ~ ~n~ ~ ~ ~n the ~ J~R.~. The injuries of physically abused children usually appear on both sides of the body (both sides of the back or buttocks, both legs or arms, etc~) and are clustered around a particular bodily area. A child who is repeatedly spanked on the buttocks will show evidence of bruises on both sides without evidence of trauma to other bodily areas. ~. The child shovsEu~Irumlof~~~ a. On the face, llps, or mouth b. On the large areas of the torso, back, buttocks, or thighs Page 33 C d. e. On both sides of the body 1 ~ I In unusual or clustered patterns Reflective of an instrument used to inflict the injury (rope,.paddle, coat hanger, stock, etc.) Burns a. circular burns separately or in a series received from cigars or cigarettes usually inflicted on: -- the palm~ of the hands -- the soles of the feet -- the arms -- scalp b. Immersion burns indicative of dunking in hot liqui Such burns usually have a clear line o/__immersion which differentiates abuse from accidental injurie Areas commonly traumatized are: -- the hands up to the wr~st (glove-like in appearance) -- the feet just above the ankles (sock-like in appearance) -- the buttocks and genital areas C. Caustic burns resulting from chemicals (acid, etc.) being splashed or poured on the child. d. Reflecting patterns that show the shape of the object (iron, grill, etc.) that was used to inflict the injury. e.

Spiral fractures of the long bones of the acres and legs : ~ : . : c. Multiple fractures (arms, legs, etc.] \\ Page 3 4 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 1 I I d. In-any child under the age of two, many fractu:es may not be outwardly visible. The following signs may indicate a bone fracture: -- tenderness and swelling of body part -- child is reluctant \"to move that part of the body -- child tries to protect that part of the body from contact with others X-ray is the only resource to document bone fractures and dislocations in very young children. But, X-rays will never be taken unless someone is suspicious and requests further investigation. Ocular injuries a. Dislocated lens, retinal and subretinal hemo~rhag~ usually caused by grabbing the child and shaking the child violently. b. Bruises or \"black eyes\" caused by t:auma to the ocular region. Kt~uUm~ ~ Injuries (blisters, bruises] occur as a result of the child being tied with a rope or cord. The injuries commonly appear around: -- the mouth (being gagged) -- the wrists and/or ankles (being tied) -- the neck or torso (being hung) E~u~ trauma a. Bald patches on scalp resulting from hair pulling b. Seizures in a child with no previous history of such. The seizures may be manifestations of cephalic hematomas or subdural hematomas caused % Page 3 5 i~EJJ~L~i~and Abrasions a. Mouth, lips, or gums b. External genitalia Behavioral Indicators and Characteristics of Abused Children It is often said that the most severe trauma a child suffers as a result of abuse is not physical but emotional. The physical wounds often heal--but the emotional scars that have resulted from acts of violence may last a lifetime. These emotional scars may =anifest themselves in the following behaviors: . Extreme fricht. Some children manifest extreme fright at the prospect of any physical contact; they whimper and attempt to hide under the sheets, for example. . Apathy. Some children exhibit profound apathy to the point of appearing to be in a stupor; they may not withdraw from tactile stimulation. . ~I~%KiA.q. A child's behavior may resemble what is known as \"shell shock\" in adults. They display a profound blunting of all external manifestations of inner life. They may: a. Sit or lie motionless b. Be devoid of facial expression c. Be unresponsive to all attempts at evoking recognition of the external world . ~S_q/_~h~. Harsh physical punishment of a child often leads to development of serious violent and delinquent behaviors. . ~. Serious emotional illnesses may develop as a result of severe and persistent physical abuse. Self-destructive behavior, suicidal attempts and self-mutilations are significantly higher in abused children than in nonabused children. . Pseudo ~L~t/~. Children develop extremely precocious skills in initiating, social contact.~with adults as a means of guarding and pcoteccinq themselves..: ~ ~ Page 3 6 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I i ! . HvDervlqilan~e. Some abused children become hyper- vigilant. These children: I I I ae b. c.

To increase understanding of the benefits of the Children's Advocacy Center multidisciplinary approach to child victims of abuse. 5. Identify the common program components of the CAC model, and explore programmatic options that have been adopted by tribes to meet the needs of child victims of abuse in Indian Country. 6. Define steps that are commonly taken in developing a multidisciplinary team and Child Advocacy Center. A Children's Advocacy Center is a child-focused, facility-based program in which representatives from many disciplines meet to discuss and make decisions about investigation, treatment, and prosecution of child abuse cases. The multidisciplinary team approach brings together all the professionals and agencies needed to offer comprehensive services: law enforcement, child protective services, prosecution, mental health and the medical community. This workshop will address the actions of the team in organizing and maintaining a mutlidisciplinary team as well as a Children' Advocacy Center.

The need for coordinated interdisciplinary approaches to child abuse is great in Indian Country, and nine tribes are now working to fully develop their own CACs customized to meet the needs of their communities. The CAC model is particularly suited to federal policy of tribal self-determination and leadership. Implementation of the interdisciplinary approach is largely determined by cultural and geographic factors ~t, vell as the resources available, and is limited only by the vision of the community. A Children's Advocacy Center is a child-focused, facility-based program in which representatives from many disciplines meet to discuss and make decisions about investigation, treatment, and prosecution of child abuse cases. The multi-disciplinary team approach brings together under one umbrella all the professionals and agencies needed to offer comprehensive services: law enforcement, child protective services, prosecution, mental health and the medical community. CACs are community-based programs designed by professionals and volunteers to meet the unique needs of a community and prevent the further victimization of children. This comprehensive approach ensures that children receive child-focused services in a child-friendly environment - one in which the child's needs comes first! The CAC approach is a flexible one. Some centers operate as independent nonprofit organizations in a free-standing facility such as a renovated house. Others are agency-affiliated and may share space and resources. What unites the CACs is that the needs of the child and non- offending family members are quickly and effectively met through the following core components: Separate, child-friendly space for interviewing and providing services to child victims and their non-offending family members Involvement of specially trained professionals from the six core disciplines: law enforcement, child protective services, prosecution, mental health, medical and victims advocacy Coordinated multidisciplinary investigative team Regular interdisciplinary ease review or staffing and intensive ease follow-up In an effort to assist communities in improving their response to child abuse through development of CACs, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) established four Regional Children's Advocacy Centers to provide information, consultation, training and technical assistance. An area of special emphasis for the Western Regional Children's Advocacy Center has been the development of strategies to meet the needs of Native American and Native Alaskan communities and the challenges of creating interdisciplinary approaches that involve tribal, county, state and/or federal jurisdictions. The RCACs assist communities in the following areas: Assessing the community's capacity to provide services Assisting in the development of comprehensive, multidiseiplinary responses to child abuse Encouraging open communication and case coordination among the professionals and agencies involved in child protection efforts Enhancing professional skills among the interdisciplinary partners Identifying and developing funding and marketing strategies I Strengthening the organizational Capacity of CACs Assisting with plans for: program expansion Increasing community understanding of child abuse and community readiness to support multidisciplinary teams and CACs For additional information on Children's Advocacy Centers, please contact your Regional Child Advocacy Center or the National Network of Children's Advocacy Centers: Western Regional Children's Advocacy Center Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming (800) 582 - 2203 or wrcac@rmi.net Teresa Cain, Executive Director \"Y., lg- Midwest Regional Children's Advocacy Center Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota (888) 422 - 2955 or julie.pape@childrenshc.org Julie Pape, Project Director Northeastern Regional Children's Advocacy Center Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, New Jersey (800) 662 - 4124 or ru'cac@cacphila.org Ann Lynn, Project Coordinator Southern Regional Children 's Advocacy Center Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas, Texas, District of Columbia, Delaware, Oklahoma, West Virginia (800) 747 - 8122 or srcac~aol.com Carolyn Gilbert, Project Director National Children's Alliance (800) 239 - 9950 or info@nca-online.org Nancy Chandler, Executive Director For additional information on the tribally-sponsored Children's Advocacy Centers, please contact: Crow Creek The Children's Safe Place - Ft.

EXERCISE FOUR: RESTITUTION Restitution is another word that you may or may not be familiar with, but one that is important in your treatment. To make restitution means to pay back or make up for a wrong that you have committed. For you, this means that you should try to pay back the community or people you have harmed by your sexual offense. The most obvious person harmed by your offense was the victim or victims of your offenses. The next most obvious people are the families of the vietirns. But there are others, too. You have harmed your own family by engaging in inappropriate sexual behavior and you have harmed the community you live in. Thus, you need to think about restitution or paying back, in several ways. First, you should think about possible restitution to your victim and the victim's parents. This might involve a face-to-face meeting with the victim or it may involve writing a letter. Often, however, your victims do not want any contact with you. This will be determined by the therapists and they will either arrange for further eo .~.uqi.'.eation or inform you that they do not want contact with you. Nevertheless, it is important to think through in your own mind what you couldsay to the victim and the parents as part of your restitution. In the group session, you will discuss the things that should go in such a letter. List, in the space below, things that you think should go in the letter. During the discussion in group, you should add to your list. Points to Include in the Letter to My Victim and in a Letter to My Victim's Parents: 1. I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I . I . . I .

I I Editors\" Introduction I \"Don't Shoot, We're Your Children\": Have We Gone Too Far in Our Response to Adolescent Sexual Abusers and Children With Sexual Behavior Problems? Fifteen years ago, when we first began working with adolescent sex offenders, treatment providers faced many obstacles. There were no treatment models uniquely designed from scratch for this population. No true experimental research had been used to evaluate the effectiveness of either customary or spe- cialized interventions. There were no prospective data on the natural course of behavior in these young- sters. And there were no prospective data on the risk factors for developing the behavior. No empirically derived typologies existed. No actuarial risk assess- ment was available. Of course, the need to respond to social problems cannot and does not wait for better data. So, like our colleagues, we proceeded with some trepidation, knowing that we were largely working in the dark, and borrowed treatment models used with other populations and for other problems. We mixed and matched. We used informed guesswork, tried to remain guided by theory and professional standards, and hoped. Now, 15 Fears later, things have changed. Unfortu- nately, much of what has changed has not been the state of our knowledge about many of the central questions needed to intelligently design interven- flops. Certainly, we have much more information about many important questions--general psycho- logical characteristics, program descriptions, behav- ior patterns, relapse rates following intervention, fam- ily characteristics, and so forth. However. not one of the basic critical questions described above has been answered more than tentatively, if at all. There are still no true experimental studies comparing outcomes of treated versus untreated adolescents and no prospec- CHILD MALTRE.&TMENT. Yol. 3. No. 4. November 1998 314-316 O 1998 Sage Public=dons. Inc. 314 five data on either risk factors or the natural course of the behavior; there are only the beginnings of empiri- cal typologies and no actuarial risk assessment. Largely, the field is still using treatment models and assumptions borrowed and adapted from programs developed for incarcerated adult pedophiles. These things have not changed. Disturbingly, what has changed is the conviction that we have found the right track. The field has evolved conventional wisdoms that, like all conven- tional wisdoms, became accepted as fact when re- peated and reinforced often enough. In some cases, they may shade into dogma. These might include beliefs, for example, that sex offender-specific treat- ment is the only acceptable and effecdve approach and that all teens and children who have performed inappropriate sexual behaviors must receive it; that a history of personal victimization is usually present, is a direct cause of abusive sexual behavior, and must be a focus of treatment; that denial must be broken; that hard, in-your-face confrontation is synonymous with good therapy; that treatment must be long term and involve highly restrictive conditions; that deviant arousal, deviant fantasies, grooming, and deceit are intrinsic features; that parents and families of offend- ers are generally dysfunctional; that long-term resi- dential placement is commonly required; that the behaviors always involve an offense cycle or pattern that must be identified; that these teenagers and their parents must face the fact that they have a compulsive, incurable, life-long disorder;, and that these young- sters are such dangerous predatory criminals that neighborhoods must be notified of their presence. Despite their wide acceptance, it is our opinion that clear, empirical scientific support for each and every one of these conventional wisdoms is either minimal or nonexistent.

Bonnet I EDITORS' INTRODUCTION offenders who have been in treatment programs are typically modest (around 5%-15%), despite wide- spread public and professional assumptions to the conu-ar T. However, we do not know if this represents any difference from relapse rates of untreated adoles- cents. Empirically, we cannot say whether treatment helps, hurts, or makes no difference. Furthermore, the available data do not support any one type of treatment over another with the exception of tenta- tively supporting the delinquency-focused muldsys- temic treatment over individual counseling. One thing the data does support is the fact that nonsexual problems appear to be vasdy more common than do sexual ones for these teenagers. The Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers (KrSA; 1997) has endorsed the position that \"poor social competency skills and deficits in self-esteem can best explain sex- ual deviance in juveniles, rather than the paraphilic interests and psychopathic characteristics that are more common in adult offenders\" and that \"there is little evidence to support the assumption that the majority of juvenile sexual offenders are destined to become adult sexual offenders, or that these youths engage in acts of sexual perpetration for the same reasons as their adult counterparts\" (pp. 1-2). Given this, perhaps it is time to emphasize some flexibility and compassion in which treatments we choose and to which individual youngsters we apply them and to realize that individual need, not dogma~ should dic- tate what must be accomplished. The potential benefit of intervening with youthful sexual abusers is a real one. The fact remains that a significant amount of child sexual abuse and related behaviors are committed by children and teenagers. The fact remains that some currently unknown, but probably not insignificant, proportion of youthful abusers continue abusive behavior into adulthood and that adult abusers who have adolescent onsets may be responsible for a higher-than-usual number of events. To the extent that we can identify ~ose truly at risk and work productively with them, our commu- nities will be safer. But in the process, we should not forget that these are our children. And, as profession- als committed to children's rights and welfare, we should think carefully about their rights and welfare before responding to their behavior.

CHILD MALTREATMENT I NOVEMBER 1998 I 318 Becker I KNOWLEDGE OF SEX-OFFENDING ADOLESCENTS I avoid labeling the youth as having a paraphilia (sexual disorder). Given the lack of theoretically driven research and longitudinal studies, caution is also advised in making statements that juveniles who have engaged in sexu- ally inappropriate behaviors will have to be monitored for the rest of their lives and that juveniles should have to register as sexual offenders even if they have en- gaged in only one sexual behavior that is considered norm violating. Caution is further urged in the man- dating of registration or community notification for all juveniles who have committed sexual offenses. More research is needed to help us understand which juveniles represent true risks to the community and are in need of monitoring. The etiologies and developmental course of sexual offending behaviors in juveniles has yet to be deter- mined. What we do know from existing literature is that they are a heterogeneous group. Given this, fur- ther research is needed to develop typologies and then to tailor treatment and intervention to the spe- cific needs of the youth. We can no longer afford to take the one-size-fits-all approach with these adoles- cents. It has not been empirically supported, is poten- tiaUy costly, and, in some cases, may be detrimental to youth and their families. With these cautions in mind, this review will provide a summary of what has been reported in the literature regarding characteristics of juvenile sexual offenders, assessment findings, and treatment reports. The literature reviewed will be limited to adolescent offenders and does not include literature concerning prepubertal children with sex- ual behavior problems. IL'~OLOGI]E:S OF SEXUAL OYF]E2qDING BEHAVIORS Researchers have proposed a number of theories to explain the etiology of sexually inappropriate be- havior in adults; however, to date, there is no generally accepted theory regardingjuvcnile sexual offending. A number of factors have received empirical and clinical attention in the literature, including maltreat- ment experiences, exposure to pornography, sub- stance abuse, and exposure to aggressive role models (Becker & Hunter, 1996). Currently, two models have been described in the literature. Ryan, Lane, Davis, and Isaac (1987) identify the sexual abuse o/de. This model begins with the adolescent having a negative self-image, Which results in an increased probability of maladaptive coping strategies when confronted with negative responses to himself or herself. The negative self-image also leads the individual to predict a negative reaction from others. To protect against this anticipated rejection, the adolescent will become socially isolated and withdrawn and will begin to fan- tasiz e to compensate for his or her feelings of lack of control or powerlessness. Finally, the sexual offense itself is physically carried out, leading to more nega- tive serf-imaging and thoughts of rejection. As can be seen, this is a repetitive o/de. Becker and Kaplan's (1088) model proposed that the first sexual offense results from a combination of individual characteristics, such as lack of social skills and a history of nonsexual deviance, [amily variables including family relationships, and social-environ- mental variables such as social isolation and antisocial behavior. Following the commission of the first sex crime, the juvenile can embark on three possible paths: (a) the dead-end path on which he or she commits no further crimes; (b) the delinquency path on which the individual not only commits other sex- ual offenses, but also engages in general non-sex offenses and deviant behaviors; and (c) the sexual- interest pattern path on which the adolescent contin- ues to commit sex crimes and often develops a paraphilic arousal pattern. It is important to note that neither of these two models have been empirically derived, nor have they been empirically validated. The Becker/Kaplan model was derived through clini- cal observations. Ryan et al.'s (1087) basic assump- tion is that to prevent further offending, offenders must have a framework on which to analyze their thoughts and feelings so they can self-monitor and modify their behavior prior to offending. Recently, Kobayashi, Sales, Becker, Figueredo, & Kaplan (1995) used structural equation modeling to test a theoretical model of the etiology of deviant sexual aggression by adolescent males. The tested model included several family factors including per- ceived parental deviance, child physical and sexual abuse history, and child bonding with parents. These authors report that the results indicated that physical abuse by fathers and sexual abuse by males increased sexual aggression by adolescents. Bonding to mothers was found to decrease sexual aggression. Weinrott (1996) has recently critiqued this study and noted its methodological flaws; however, he noted that the two findings that emerged regarding physical and sexual victimization by males being associated with greater sexual aggression and bonding to mothers tending to mitigate the relationship may well hold up on replication. In reviewing the literature on etiology and deveb opmental progression of sexual aggression, Weinrott (1996) notes that most explanations ofjuvenile sexual crime are too simplistic or are applied universally. He recommended improved integration of findings from typology research and etiological studies, noting that distinct types of juvenile sexual offenders should be CHILD MALTREATMENT I NOVEMBER 1998 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 320 Becker I KNOWLEDGE OF SEX-OFFENDING ADOLESCENTS I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I dal/y in regard to extramarital affairs. Kaplan, Becket, and Cunningham-Rathner (1988) interviewed 27 par- ents of adolescent incest perpetrators regarding demographic characteristics, prior history of victimi- zation and abuse, and parents' attitudes about their sons engaging in incestuous behaviors. Of the parents interviewed, 70% were the offenders' mothers. Ninety-three percent reported they had never been psychiatrically hospitalized, 96% had no prior history of nonsexual arrest, and only 9% had been arrested for a sex crime. Of the parents, 27% disclosed that they themselves had been physically abused and 30% disclosed that they had been sexually abused. Com- paring mothers of adolescent incest offenders with parents ofnonincest sexual offenders, the majority of the incest perpetrators had mothers who were not living with adult partners (Kaplan, Becker, & Martinez, 1990). Graves et al. (1996), in the course of their meta- analysis, provide data on family structure and family interaction pattern as well as on parental use of alco- hol and drugs and parental psychiatric illness. Con- siderably more of the juvenile assault offenders (78%) lived in single-parent families than did pedophilic offenders (44%) and mixed offenders (37%). How- ever, 53% of the pedophilic youth reported living with foster families and blended families. The mixed offense offenders more often were living in single- parent families (37%) or with their biological fami- lies (36%). In regard to family interaction pattern, the follow- ing four dichotomous variables were analyzed (flexible/ structured, chaotic/rigid, separated/connected, and disengaged/enmeshed). Graves et al. (1996) report that the pedophilic and sexually assaulted youth tended to come from chaotic/rigid and disen- gaged/enmeshed families. These authors noted that although the majority of sexual offenders came from homes employing pathological interactions, some of the youth came from homes that had been coded as hap/~ Data on parental alcohol abuse indicated that more of the pedophilic participants' mothers (43%) reported abusing alcohol, compared to 39% of those of the mixed offenders' and 17% of those of the sexual assault offenders. Data on drug usage indi- cated that 69% of the fathers and 43% of the mothers had used or abused illicit drugs. Regarding parental psychiatric illness, illness had been noted in '29% of the mothers ofpedophilicyouth compared to 13% of the mixed offense offenders. For the fathers, 18% of the Fathers ofpedophilic youth and 5% of the fathers of the mixed offense offenders were noted to have psychiatric disorders. Similarly, these authors found that 12% of the Fathers and 20% of the mothers of youth with sexual behavior problems had psychiatric illnesses. Graves et al. (1996) discussed the conceptual and methodological implications of research and limita- tions of research conducted to date. As these authors note, a critical issue relates to sampling procedures--- studies to date have underestimated upper-class fami- lies, and research conducted to date has provided limited information on the families x)f these youth. A second issue relates to conceptualization. For exam- ple, the U.S. Department of Justice reports only aggre- gate data, as opposed to specifying subgroups of sex- ual offenders. Also, many of the instruments that have been used to assess juvenile sexual offenders have not been standardized. Harris (1997) has reviewed the literature on juvenile sexual offenders and developed a matrix of assessment instruments that have been used to assess adolescent sexual offenders. Many of the instruments that have been reported in the litera- ture to assess offenders do not present data on reli- ability and validity. CHARACTERISTICS OF ADOLESCENT FEMALES There has been an increasing awareness that juve- nile females also engage in sexual-offending behavior (Fehrenbach & Monastersky, 1988; Hunter, Lcxier, Goodwin, Browne, & Dennis, 1998; Matthews, Hunter, & Vuz, 1997). Fehrenbach and Monastersky (1988) reported on 28 female adolescents who were seen at a juvenile sexual offender program at the University of Washington. Of the female adolescents, 15 had been referred for rape and 13 for indecent liberties. Indecent//berg/e.swere defined as sexual touch- ing of victims or as offenders having victims touch offenders. All behaviors were short of penetration. Rape was defined as either anal or vaginal intercourse or penetration of victims with objects. Of the 28 fe- male adolescents, 36% had assaulted males, 57% had committed offenses against females, and two of the offenders had assaulted both male and female victims. All of the victims were known to the offenders. Four- teen percent had committed a delinquent act not involving a person--for example, theft. Of this popu- lation, 21% reported that they had been physically abused, and 50% reported they had been sexually abused. Hunter et al. (1993) reported on 10 adolescent females who were receiving treatment in a residential treatment program for emotionally and behaviorally maladjusted youth. The average age of the females was 15 (range being 13 to 17 years of age). The authors assessed developmental/psychiatric charac- teristics, maltreatment experiences, and perpetration CHILD MALTREATMENT I NOVEMBER 1998 322 Becker I KNOWLEDGE OF SEX-OFFENDING ADOLESCENTS I COMIPARISON OF SEX AND NON-SEXUAL O~ER GROUPS In general, there has been a paucity of studies comparing juvenile sexual offenders with nonsexual delinquents. Ford and Linney (1995) compared three groups of juvenile offenders: juvenile sexual offend- ers, violent non-sexual offenders, and status offend- ers. Youth were in residence in one of four types of facilities: a facility to which youth were temporarily committed for diagnostic evaluations, a residential facility that provided services to status offenders, or two long-term residential facilities. The juvenile sex- ual offender group consisted of youth who had com- mitted sexual offenses against children (at least 5 years younger than offenders) and those who had committed offenses against peers or adults. Measures included: demographic and background informa- tion, structured interview, the Conflict Tactic Scale (CTS), the Children's Assertive Behavior Scale (CABS), the Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Orientation-Behavior Questionnaire (FIRO-B), and the Piers-Harris Children's Self-C0ncept Scale (PHCSC). The groups did not differ as to age, living situation (the majority lived in single-parent house- holds), family offense history, or intelligence (the majority fell in the low-average range). However, differences were found in offense his, tory. More than 60% of the child molesters were adjudicated on a first offense, whereas two thirds of the rapists had three or more prior offenses, usually for status or property offenses. Differences were ob- served on the CTS. Those youth who had committed sexual offenses against children had experienced more parental violence than did the status offenders and rapists. The child molesters also had been sexu- ally victimized at a greater frequency than were the other groups--52% for the child molesters versus 17% for rapists and violent non-sexual offenders and versus 15% for status offenders. Although no statistY call}, significant differences were found on the PHCSC, the child molesters reported experiencing problems on \"the following four scales: Displays of Problematic Behavior, Attitudes Toward Their Physi- cal Appearances, Dysphoric Mood and Anxiety, and Popularity With Peers. On the CABS, the violent of. fenders reported that their friends got into more trouble than did the other groups. Significant differ- ences were observed on the HRO-B--the child mo- lesters reported the greatest desire to control inter- personal relationships. The groups also differed on exposure to soft- and hard-core pornography. Al- though 42% of the sexual offenders reported expo- sure to hard-core sexual magazines, only 29% of the violent and status offenders reported such exposure. I Furthermore, the sexual offenders were exposed at earlier ages (5 to 8 years of age). Given that many of the rapists had prior offense histories for status and property offenses, one might hypothesize that their I sexual offending was part of an overall pattern of conduct-disordered behavior and, consequently, would not differ significantly from the other two [] groups on many of the variables other than early n exposure to pornography. Recently, Jacobs, Kennedy, and Mayer (1997) as- i sessed 156 juvenile delinquents who had been com- B mitred to the Dozier School for Boys in Florida. The 156 youth were divided into two groups of equal number. Half of the youth had committed sexual n offenses against younger or peer victims. The other half were non-sexual offenders and had been com- mitted for both violent and nonviolent offenses. These youth were assessed and compared on delin- I quency history, intelligence, academic achievement, and psychopathology. The sexual offender group was aa older than was the non-sexual offender group at first I referral to the state (12.7 vs. 12.0) and had fewer prior delinquent referrals (12 vs. 17) and fewer prior com- mitments to the state for delinquent acts (2.5 vs. 3.~5). I No significant difference was found for IQ scores or for academic achievement testing. Furthermore, no statistically significant findings were apparent on the Hare Psychopathy Checldist-R (PCL,R). The total I score for the sexual offenders was 97.24, compared to 26.19 for the non-sexual offenders. The juvenile sex- m ual offenders in this study of incarcerated youth were n quite versatile in their conduct-disordered behaviors u as assessed by the PCR, which maybe due to the fact that only the more dangerous and delinquent youth are incarcerated, whereas the less violent or delin- quent youth receive treatment in the community. Hastings, Anderson, and Hemphill (1997) also as- sessed daily stress, coping behaviors, and problem | behavio .rs as well as cognitive distortions of adolescent sexual offenders, conduct-disordered youth, and a i control group of adolescents. The juvenile sexual i offenders were recruited from both outpatient and i inpatient treatment programs. The conduct-disor- dered youth were recruited from a group home. As- i sessment instruments included a coping and problem [] experiences scale, a daily hassle questionnaire, the Revised Behavior Problem Checklist (RBPC), and an I automatic thought questionnaire-revised. Significant I differences were found on the Coping scale and the RPBC. Conduct-disordered youth scored higher than did the adolescent sexual offenders and control n group on avoiding problems. The conduct-disor- dered youth also endorsed more frequent use of hav- ing sex with someone and hitting someone when n CHILD MALTREATMENT/NOVEMBER 1998 I I 324 Becker I KNOWLEDGE OF SEX-OFFENDING ADOLESCENTS I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I offender groups. They note the importance of tailor- ing treatment to address the specific psychopatholo- gics of these youth. These MMPI studies provide evi- dence that personality assessment may be used for both developing typologies as well as assisting in de- lineating the focus of treatment for youth who have sexual behavior problems. In addition to the MMPI, the Millon Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI) has been used to evaluate and compare the personality characteristics of adolescents who molested children (victims less than 12 years of age) and those who offended against their peers (vic- tims at least 13 years of age and no less than 2 years younger than offenders) (Carpenter, Peed, & East- man, 1995). Results indicated that adolescents who had offended against children scored significantly higher on the schizoid, avoidant' and dependent scales, compared to the adolescents who committed sexual offenses against their peers. Furthermore, the child victim group scores on the Dependent scale were within the clinically significant range. There were no significant differences between the two groups on the Histrionic, Narcissistic, and Antisocial scales. However, the degree of narcissism among those adolescents who offended against their peers was within the clinically significant range. Both groups' scores were within the clinically significant range on the Antisocial Personality Scale. This study is of importance in that it contrasted two groups of adolescent offenders and found that although both scored within the clinical range on the Antisocial scale, the peer offenders showed more narcissistic traits, whereas the child offenders showed more schiz- oid, dependent, and avoidant traits. Perhaps conduct disorder underlies both groups; however, the child offenders may have difficulty in relating to peers, may avoid them, and may feel more comfortable with less mature youth. Peer offenders, on the other hand, are more exploitive of adolescents their own age. Personality characteristics of juvenile sexual of. fenders and adolescents who have committed non- sexual crimes also have been assessed using the Ror- schach (McGraw & Pcgg-McNad, 1989). All youth were assessed on an outpatient basis. Two statistically significant differences wcrc found: The sexual of- fender group provided more responses and gave more anatomy responses (hypochondriacal preoccu- pation, repressed hostility, self-absorption) than did the non-sexual offenders. It is important to note, however, that the majority of the sexual offender group also had histories of engaging in nonsexual crimes and that the Rorschach examiner is not always blind to the reason for referral. What is clear from the above cited studies is that results can be influenced by whether the youth are being evaluated and/or receiving treatment on an outpatient basis or whether they are incarcerated. In general, the more serious psychopathology is seen when youth are incarcerated. Also, given that many of the sexual offender youth also had histories of non- sexual offenses, it is not surprising that frequently, no differences are found when compared to nonsexual offenders. Finally, one can never rule 6ut that non- sexual offenders have not committed sex offenses. Some of the comparison groups may in fact contain undetected or undisclosed youth who have also en- gaged in sexually offending behavior. Future research on personality assessment should group participants according to inpatient/outpatient status, types of crimes committed, and gender and age of victims. Furthermore, attempts should be made to distinguish between youth who have only committed sex offenses (no history of nonsexual offenses), youth who have committed both sexual and nonsexual of- fenses, and youth who have only committed sexual offenses. ASSESSMENT OF COMORBrD PSYCHOLOGICAL AND/OR PSYCHIATRIC PROBLF.ALS Clinicians and researchers have reported on the presence of other psychological and psychiatric prob- lems in youth who have committed sexual offenses (Bcckcr 1991; Bcckcr & Stein, 1991; Shanok, Lewis and coUcagues (1979) compared incarcer- ated juvenile sexual offenders to a group of incarcer- ated violent offenders. She found that both groups had a significant prevalence of other psychiatric symp- toms including depression, auditory hallucinadons, paranoia, and thought disorders. Kavoussi et al. (1988) evaluated a sample of adolescent sexual of- fenders sccn on an outpadent basis using DSM-III (APA, 1980) criteria. Conduct disorder was the most common diagnosis (48%). Those who had raped either their peers or adults had a higher prevalence of conduct disorder (75%) compared to those who had molested chUdrcn (38%). Of the adolescents, 20% evidenced some symptoms of adjustment disor- der with depressed mood, and 19% had no diagnos- able DSM-III disorder. Given that the youth in the Lewis ct al. (1979) study wcrc incarcerated and those in the Kavoussi etal. (1988) study were not, one could hypothesize that the lack of serious psychopathology in the Kavoussi ct al. study was duc to the fact that the less disordered adolescents arc allowed to remain in CHILD MALTREATMENT I NOVEMBER 1998 326 Becket I KNOWLEDGE OF SEX-OFFENDING ADOLESCENTS I cant differences between the groups on intelligence, age of victims targeted, presence of official arrests for sexual crimes, or type of abuse they perpetrated. The abused youth began 1.6 years earlier than did the nonabused, had two rimes the number of victims, were more likely to have both male and female vic- rims, and were less likely to abuse only nonfamily members. Cultural/ethnic differences were ob- served, with fewer African American youth reporting that they had been abused than did Caucasian youth. The abused youth had higher scores on Scale Sc (schizophrenia) and marginally higher on Scale Pd (psychopathic deviate) of the MMPI. Abused and nonabused youth did not differ on the Family Adaptation and Cohesion Evaluation Scale (FACES-III). Mixed results were found between the groups on criminality and delinquency, with the non- abused having two times the number of arrests for nonsexual crimes. However, they did not differ on self-reported delinquent behaviors. These authors hy- pothesize that there may be different developmental pathways to sexual offending related to abuse history, with sexually abused youth being more likely to de- velop deviant sexual arousal patterns. This possibility is supported by their earlier age of onset and more victims, specifically, more male victims. PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGIC ASSESSMENT OF MALE ADOLESCENT SEXUAL OFFENDERS Penile plethysmography is one form of assessing sexual arousal. In phallometric assessment, changes in penile tumescence are assessed while the respon- dent is exposed to a variety of sexual and nonsexual stimuli. There is a considerable body of literature on phallometric assessment with adult offenders, and its usefulness is well-established (Murphy & Barbaree, 1994). However, it is less clear how useful it is with adolescents. This form of assessment may be useful to the clinician in assessing some adolescents when used in a manner consistent with the guidelines recom- mended by the Association for the Tfi:atment of Sex- ual Abusers (1997) and the National Task Force on Juvenile Sex Offending (National Adolescent Perpe- trator Network, 1993). There is very little research on phallometric assessment with juvenile offenders (Becker, Hunter, Goodwin, Kaplan, & Martinez, 1992; Becket, Hunter, Stein, & Kaplan, 1989; Becker, Kaplan, & Tenke, 1992; Hunter, Goodwin, & Becker, 1994; Hunter, Becker, & Kaplan, 1995; Kaemingk, Koselka, Becket, & Kaplan, 1995). In general, the data indicates that the relationship between phallometric arousal and certain clinical characteristics appears weaker in an adolescent population than in an adult population. TRF~ As has been noted previously, there is a growing body of literature on reports of treatment outcome; however, there is only one controlled treatment out- come study in the literature. In part, the lack of controlled outcome studies relates td the ethics of randomly assigning offenders who may represent a danger to public safety to a wait-list control group or to a no-treatment control group. In addition, many of the uncontrolled studies have been fraught with methodological problems (Becker & Hunter, 1997). Becker and Kaplan (1993), Becker and Hunter (1997), and Pithers et al. (1995) provide a detailed description of treatment modalities that have been used in the treatment of juvenile sexual offenders. Borduin, Henggeler, Blaske, and Stein (1990) have conducted the only controlled treatment outcome study comparing multisystemic therapy (MST) with individual therapy. MST is an ecologically focused delinquency intervention that is described elsewhere in this issue (Swenson, Schoenwald, Randall, Heng- geler, & Kaufman, 1998 [this issue]). Juveniles were followed for an average of 37 months. Seventy-five percent (75%) of the youth who received individual therapy recidivated, compared with 12.5% of those who received MST. However, sample sizes were very small and the study has yet to be replicated. Kahn and Ghambers (1991) provide data on a retrospective follow-up on 221 juvenile sexual offend- ers treated in 10 programs in the state of Washington (some of the programs were outpatient and some were residential).Juveniles were followed for an aver- age of 20 months. Whereas the sexual recidivism rate was low (7.5%), the overall recidivism rate (nonsexual offenses) was high (44.8%). Schram et al. (1991) re- ported on the results of an extended follow-up of 197 of the juveniles on which Kahn and Ghambers (1991) reported. The rate of sexual reoffenses remained low, with 12.2% having been rearrested and 10% having been convicted of subsequent sex offenses. Becker (1990) provided follow-up data on 80juve- nile sexual offenders who were treated on an outpa- tient basis and followed, in many cases, for up to 2 years. Reddivism data were determined by interview- ing the youth, families, and referral sources. Of the youth, 8% had sexually reoffended. Sixty percent were convicted for nonsexual offenses. Although the above cited studies have reported on the efficacy of specialized treatment programs for juvenile sexual offenders, Lab, Shields, and Schondel CHILD MALTREATMENT I NOVEMBER 1998 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 328 Becker/KNOWLEDGE OF SEX-OFFENDING ADOLESCENTS ictus should be considered for implementation in the area of sexual abuse.

I I I I I I I I I I 7 th Indian Nations Conference \"Working with Sexual Assault Victims and Their Families\" Anne Munch, esq. Learning Objectives: 1. To understand the myths, realities and challenges of sexual assault in our communities. 2. To understand how sexual assault affects the victim and our relationships with them. 3. To learn how to successfully work with victims of sexual assault and their families. This workshop will review how victims of sexual assault are perceived by our society, by themselves, and by our criminal justice system. In looking at this issue, we will examine the myths and realities of sexual assault, and the victim's reactions to sexual violence. We will identify \"do's and don'ts\" of working with victims of sexual assault and their families, and learn effective means of assisting victims and their families through the rigors of the criminal justice system. Tulsa, Oklahoma 1999 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I With Sexual Assault and their Families\" \"Working Vic~ms Seventh National Indian Nations Conference September 28-30, Tulsa Oklahoma I Presented by Anne P. Munch, esq. I I I I I I I I I I . A Statistical Overview a. Children 1L One in four girls and one in six boys are sexually assaulted before age 18. (RrUz~ar.l~2) > Overall, out of home abuse constitutes less than 5% of all sexual abuse cases reported to CPS agencies. Based on reports from 19 states in 1995, about 2% of all forms of confirmed abuse occurred in a daycare or foster care setting. (N=onalCmvn=eetoPreventC~ndA~Jse. 1996) > A 1996 national incidence study conducted by the federal government found that girls are sexually abused three times more offeR than boys. (se=~ s ea-~h.rst. -s=cu~. Summary of the 3 ~ National IrwJdence Study of Child Abuse and Neglece,\" 1996) ). About 115,000 cases of sexual abuse enter child protective services caseloads annually. (McCOy S Daro, Current Trends in Child Abuse Rel:aling Fatalities:The Results of the 1994 Annual F'#ty State Sur~ey, 1995) 29% of all forcible rapes in America occurred when the victim was less than 11 years old. (NWS, \"Rape in Amedcc A Report to the Nation.\" 1992) I I > Women raped before age 18 are twice as likely to be raped as an adult, compared with women who have not been raped before age 18. 18% of women who reported being raped before age 18 said they were also raped after the age of 18, compared with 9% of the women who did not report being raped before age 18.0WAW, \"Prevalence, Incidence. and Consequences of Violence.against Women,\" November 1998) Female survivors of child sexual abuse were four times more likely than non-survivors to have worked as a prostitute; male survivors were eight times as likely. Survivors were 40% more likely to have sex with someone they didn't know. (~v,e~ jour~ of Pub,c He~h. 1991) I b. Date and Acquaintance Rape I Each year an estimated 500,000 women are the victims of some form of rape or sexual assault. I I I ii >\" Women were more likely to report being raped or sexually assaulted by friends or other acquaintances than by intimates, relatives or strangers. II Friends and acquaintances committed about half of all rapes and sexual assaults. Intimates committed an additional 26%. Altogether, offenders known to the victim accounted for about three-quarters of all rapes and sexual assaults. Strangers committed 18% of such assaults. (NCVS. \"VUen=,~,ntWomen: ~s~m the Redes~d Sunny.\" 1995) >, Sixty to seventy-five percent of victims are assaulted by someone who is an acquaintance. 95% of the victims of acquaintance rape do not report the crime to officials. (K~. \"O~end~g O=,e R~'. ~Z) I I I )' 75% of male students and 55% of female students involved in acquaintance rape had been drinking or using drugs. Only 16% of acquaintance rape victims report the crime to the police. (NWS, \"Rape in America: A Repod to the Nation,\" 1992 Women aged 16 to 24 are three times more likely to be raped than other women (us ~t of.~ 1~1) c. Reporting Rates Only sixteen percent of rapes are ever reported to police. Fifty percent of surveyed rape victims said that they would be a lot more likely and 16% would be somewhat more likely to report tapes to police if there was a law prohibiting the news media from disclosing their names and addresses. In a survey of college women, 38% reported sexual victimization, which met the legal definition of a rape or attempted rape, yet only 4% or 1 out of every 25 reported their assault to the police. > (NWS, Rape in Amedc~ A Rep<xt to the Nation,\" 1992) > The FBI estimates that only 37% of all rapes are reported to the police. The Bureau of Justice Statistics are lower, only 30.7% reported the crime. (NCVS, l~e) I I I I I I I I > A three-year study from the Senate Judiciary Committee found that: Approximately 16% of rapes are reported. Of those, about 62% lead to an arrest. Of the cases which result in conviction, half of the convicted rapists spend less than a year incarcerated. Almost a quarter of convicted rapists never go to prison. Rape cases are 40% more likely to be dismissed than cases dealing with robbery. ('r'~ake, 1990) I I I I 2 I I I I I I i I I I I I I I I I I I I I Delayed disclosure by victims of sexual assault is correlated to being a victim of child sexual abuse, the rape being completed (rather than just attempted) and use of avoidance coping mechanisms. Early disclosure was associated with the offender using alcohol before the assault and the victim seeking medical attention after the assault. (u',m=n.'co,~== and cneq~,~ ofA~uR S=o~= American Indian/Alaska Native women were most likely to report rape and physical assault victimization, while Asian Pacific Islander women were least likely to report. Hispanic women were less likely to report rape victimization than non-Hispanic women. (NVAW \"Pre~ale~e, Incidence, and Consequences of Violence Against Women,\" No~mber 1998) d. Offendem Rapists frequently have ongoing sexual relationships with spouses or girlfriends; they rape to fulfill other needs. (us Department d just=. \"Pre~nUng Vlo/ence Against Women,\" June 1995) ;. Weapons were used in only 25% of rapes and attempted rapes. (Bureau of JusSce Statistics, 1991) ~. Several studies reveal that most sexual offenders rape more than once, and most have numerous victims. 2. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder: Understanding the Basics a. What is PTSD? PTSD is defined in the DSM-III-R at section 309.89. The disorder is described as occurring when a person experiences an event that is outside the range of usual human experience and that would be markedly distressing to almost anyone. The traumatic event is then persistently re- experienced in at least one of several ways which include: ;, Recurrent and intrusive distressing recollections of the event >, Recurrent distressing dreams of the event >, Sudden acting or feeling as if the traumatic event were recurring (flashbacks) ), Intense psychological distress at exposure to events that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the event, including anniversaries of the event. PTSD also involves the persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the event or numbing of general responsiveness as indicated by at least three of the following: 3 I Efforts to avoid thoughts or feelings associated with the traumatic event >, Efforts to avoid activities or situations that arouse recollections of the event ;, Inability to recall an important aspect of the traumatic event ;, Diminished interest in significant activities Feeling of detachment or estrangement from others Difficulty expressing and receiving affection \" ~ Sense of a foreshortened future I I I I PTSD also involves persistent symptoms of increased arousal (not present before the event) as indicated by at least two of the following: ;~ Difficulty falling or staying asleep I Irritability or outbursts of anger Difficulty concentrating Hypervigilance I ~, Exaggerated startle response Physiologic reactivity upon exposure to events that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the event. I Victims who suffer from PTSD are thrown back into the initial crisis by =triggers'. These tdggedng events can cause victims to re-experience I crisis reactions, and can include: BE >, Seeing the assailant again (i.D. at trial) I Sensory stimuli (hearing, seeing, smelling, touching, tasting) BB Anniversaries of the event ;, Cdminal justice hearings I b. How common is it for sexual assault survivors to experience PTSD? II > 28% of all crime victims develop PTSD (NU) . > Direct victims of sexual assault, aggravated robbery and family members of homicide are most likely to develop PTSD (NU) i ~, A 1992 study fount that one week after a rape 94% of the survivors evaluated were expedencing PTSD. After 12 weeks, 47% were still experiencing PTSD. (R,\u00a2o~ from Ra~ Ledr~) i > 31% of surveyed rape victims developed rape related PTSD. 3.8 million adult women have suffered from rape related PTSD, and 1.3 million adult Amedcan women are still suffedng the symptoms two years after the rape. (Rape ~n ~ 1~e2) ~: 50% of the women seen at the Sexual Assault Resource Service in Minneapolis in 1993 met the cdteda for PTSD one year after the assault. 4 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I c. What are the stages survivors go through with Rape related PTSD (or Rape Trauma Syndrome)? . Stage one: Acute Immediately following sexual assault Affects to affect and behavior of the victim. > Victim may appear numb 1L , State two: Pseudo-Adjustment state ;~ Several weeks after the event > Victim may be in denial and attempting to reorganize her life > Victim may try to suppress feelings . State Three: > > > > Reactivation state May occur weeks, months or years after assaulL =Triggering event\" may begin stage Victim may seek help in this stage Feelings of shame, guilt and self-doubt dominate her thoughts. Self-blame may allow her to feel a sense of power or control over what has happened to her. Acute distress and anxiety may be evident. (flashbacks, nightmares etc) Victim may be irritable and angry May be depressed or suicidal 4. Stage Four: Anger > When the victim sees that she had no control over what happened, she may become angry or rageful Grief over the impact of the assault on the victim > Control issues become quite dominant and may be evidenced by possessiveness, stubbornness, closed- mindedness, anger toward self, anger toward others for not protecting her, isolation from loved ones, anger toward the system, self inflicted harm. The victim may be motivated into action in this stage 5. Stage Five: Resolution/Integration > No set time for this stage, and it sometimes never comes > Victim realistically accepts the event and resolves feelings about perpetrator > Victim may feel more in control, needing to control others less 5 I 3. Special.considerations for rape survivors from cultural or rural minority I m populations I The rape survivor who lives in a cultural or rural minority may have additional concerns around reporting the rape and following through on the case. Some of those concerns are: II Religious or cultural values that manifest in certain attitudes or beliefs abbut the role of a woman when it comes to sex. II ~, Conservative ChdslJan community ~, Tribal beliefs Drinking? Dancing? Out after dark? Strict stereotypical gender roles The family name ;~ Is there a reputation to uphold? II Will being a rape victim cause a stigma to the family? What about the rapist's family? ;~ Will anyone believe her given who the rapist is? Her social life ~, Does her social life revolve around the small community? ~. Will she be ostracized for coming forward? ~, Will her family and children suffer if she comes forward? Will she split the clan if she reports? ~. Does she know who to call? ), Is there 911 service in the community? ~, Does she know where law enforcement can be found? ~. Is she reluctant to call because she does know law enforcement? I I I I Is she a woman of color in a white society, she may ask: Will they believe me? Will they think I am dirty and ugly? Will they ridicule me? Will they treat the rapist too harshly if I report? Will the Fed's take over the case? Will I be further ostracized if they do? I I I I I I 6 I I I 4. The survivor's concems. What are some of the things to be aware of when working with sexual assault survivors and their families? I a. Reporting: I I I She will not be believed It is her fault >, She will be humiliated even more ~, They won't do anything to the rapist even if she does rep~)r~ What can the family do? ~, Encourage her to consider reporting. Things you can point out are: I Y She can report anonymously > She can report and then change her mind about pursuing the case I ~, She can report and get the sexual assault examination kit done in case she decides to go ahead with the case now or in the future I > She can report so it might not happen to another woman If she reports, she can qualify for victim compensation money to assist her with the support she will need I )> She can report for her own emotional health, and lay the blame where it belong ;~ Support the decision she makes I ~, if she does not want to report, do not take the law into own your hands and go out looking for the perpetrator. Encourage her to consider a rape kit exam and STD tests I ~ Do not become with her if her decision is different than angry the one you think she should make | b. I What now? What is she experiencing after the assault? She may experience an array of feelings, none of which are pleasant, and may include: ~, Shock and disbelief i > Denial Confusion Fear >, Anger I > Depression Anxiety i ~ Low self esteem ~, Guilt >, Suicidal ideation I I 7 I >.

Shyness or quietness should not be mistaken for lack of cooperation. Averted eye contact should not be mistaken for deception. I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I Interviews of Children in Multiple Victim Cases By Blaine D Mcilwaine Considerations in Dealing With Victims Expect initial denial or minimization. Reassure the victim that he or she has done nothing to be ashamed about. Note that the offender has spent more time with the victim than you have. Ambivalence is part of the process, expect some degree of continued contact with the offender. Always consider additional interviews. Establish a List of Potential Future Interviews Remember as your interviews mount up your list of victims will grow quickly.j Your potential future interviews should be of any victims that can be connected to the offender. Consider any person with knowledge of the offenders activities also a potential future interview. - This includes coworkers and neighbors. Preparation for Interviews Where and when you conduct the interview will have a direct impact on its outcome. What aids will you need to help the~,ictims recollection ? - Consider the child's age and verbal skills. - With older children consider bringing various types of calendars, yearbooks or school schedules. Determine the Approximate Number of Victims. With each victim proceed from the general to the specific. Determine the identities of other victims before you obtain any info. that could terminate the interview. Most victims will remember the first time and the last time they went to an offenders residence, or had contact with him. Behavioral Commonalties in Multiple Victim Cases Remember that many multiple victim cases involve preferential molesters. Preferential molesters (pedophiles) are predictable in their approaches to children and in their interaction with them. Can you show any common behavior demonstrated by the offender through the interviews of the children. Preferential Molesters Manifest a true sexual attraction to children. Most molest large numbers ofvictims. They are avid collectors of child pornography. They are fantasy driven and their sexual fantasies focus on children. They have well developed techniques in obtaining victims. Document Patterns of Behavior in Multiple Victim Cases Do the victims statements in general indicate a commonality of behavioral style on the offenders part. Establish his complete interaction with the child. Be sure you are asking the same general questions of each child to show reliability and consistency. Evidence in Multiple Victim Cases What evidence is described to you by the interviews of your victims. Aside from the obvious things like semen, lubricants, etc. Is there evidence the victim has described to you that would corroborate his statement. - Can he describe an item in the offenders house or bedroom ? - Is he aware of any secreted items ? Understanding the Preferential Molester Mindset Pedophiles otten engage in behavior that is in nature. This behavior is dependant on thgir t~tasy world and their inner needs. Their behavior is what we key on in the investigative process which is driven primarily by the interviews of victims. The interview of the victims helps establish our case. Intelligence Information From Interviews Does the offender keep a list of victims or a method of recording the sexual acts. Does the offender use a particular method of approaching the victims. Can the victim describe the words used by the offender. Did the offender make reference to other offenders or other victims. \"Child Erotica\" in Child Sexual Abuse Cases What can your victims tell you about this st form of evidence maintained by Preferential Molesters offenders ? You have to know what it is before you ask the correct questions during the interview. Child erotica is often overlooked in interviews ofvictims and in searches. 2 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I Child Erotica It is a broader term than Child Pornography. It can be defined as any material, relating to children, that serves a sexual purpose for a given individual. It is sometimes referred to as Pedophile Paraphernalia. It is not illegal to possess but it tell us something about the offenders mindset. Problems In Multiple Victim Cases Involving Native American Children Inadequate information on victims and families. Common last names. Inclusion of personnel not familiar with native American customs and values. Community denial and lack of cooperation by parents, guardians and bureaucrats. Investigating Multiple Victim Cases Be alert for any signs ofgroup sexual activity. It is common for a victims to be'shared by other offenders. Offenders can be victims and victims can be offenders. Expect community shock and denial once the investigation becomes public. Overcoming Problems Outside resources to augment the interviewers. Use of people knowledgeable in both multiple victim cases and in working with native Americans. Increase of case prioritization by management at all levels of all disciplines. 3 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I INTERVIEWAND INTERROGATION I !

Mcllwaine C HILD SEXUAL ABUSE INVESTIGATIONS ARE DIFFICULT at best, but the problems are compounded when the crime occurs on an Indian reservation. Indians living on reservations are often geographically isolated. In addition to physical separation from the American main- stream, Indian tribes are culturally distinct. Thejudicial system on Indian reservations is more complicated because multiple federal and tribal law enforcement agencies often have concurrent jurisdiction. The cumulative effect is that Indian reservations can provide safe havens for child molesters, both Indian and non-Indian, who often remain active for man,,, years without detection. A significant problem that many investigators face is that the vic- tim belongs to one cultural group while the investigator belongs to another. The possibility exists that investigators may make inappro- priate decisions due to unfamiliarity with tribal culture and tradi- tions. The authors are Special Agents for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) assigned to the Flagstaff, Arizona, Resident Agency and have over twenty vears of combined experience investi- gating violent crimes on the Hopi and Navajo reservations located in a remote region of northeastern Arizona. The FBI has primary responsibility for investigating violent crimes on both reservations. This study offers a survey of the problems normally associated with investigating child sexual abuse in Indian communities. Material for this study was gathered over a three-year period from 1986 to 1989. Many of the cases cited here are still in adjudication, which precludes\" the use of the defendants' names The list of prob- lems is not exhaustive, but should serve to alert the investigator to some of the difficulties that may be encountered Many Indian people.believe ihat humans must act in harmony with nature to achieve a spiritual understanding of life.

Q 158 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SPRING 1992 traditional ceremonies usually performed by a medicine man. However, each Indian tribe has its own unique customs and cultures. Socially correct behavior in one tribal setting may not be acceptable behavior in a different tribal setting. Nonetheless, American Indian cultures, with few exceptions, have strong sanctions against incest and child sexual abuse (Gail 1987): In spite of the strong sanctions against the sexual abuse of children, sex is not openly discussed in the school or the family setting. . The traditional tribal punishment for the crime of incest is ban- ishment of the offender. A tribal medicine man is then summoned to perform a purification ceremony to bring the victim back into harmo- ny with nature. According to some Indian mythology, the incest offender will suffer certain psychological and physical maladies that will eventually drive the offender to suicide. In the Navajo Indian cul- ture, it is not uncommon for the offender's family to compensate the victim's family by giving them sheep, cattle, turquoise jewelr3\", rugs, or other items of value instead of reporting the incident to the police. The investigator should become familiar with specific tribal cus- toms before conducting in-depth interviews with Native American sexual abuse victims. The following is an example of an investigator who, due to inexperience, assumed that all Indian tribes had similar cultures. In 1987, an investigation on the Navajo Indian reservation focused on a non-Indian teacher employed at a Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) school who was suspected of being a pedophile. It was anticilSated that many Navajo Indian children would have to be inter- viewed. Before conducting the interviews, the investigator consulted an expert who investigated child molestation cases on the Seminole Indian reservation in southern Florida. The expert advised the inves- tigator to tell the Navajo victims that the tribal elders had been noti- fied of the molestation allegations and urged the victims to cooperate fully with the investigators. This technique proved successful with Seminole molestation victims. However, the same approach angered the Navajo victims. The typical response of the Navajo victims was disbelief that the investigator would talk to the tribal elders. The Navajo victims did not cooperate because they knew that an,,\" infor- mation, true or false, spread quickly On the Navajo reservation. The victims were also keenly aware that information, especially' of this nature, could scar their reputations for life. The investigative tech- nique succeeded on the Seminole reservation because the Seminole tribal elders performed a leadership role different from that of the Navajo tribal elders. After receiving several negative responses from victims, a Navajo social worker was consulted and provided the inves- tigator with some basic facts regarding Navajo culture and :,. .... - ................ ......... _~~:_:: ......................... INVESTIGATING CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE 159 The investigator incorporated the advice of the social worker into subsequent interviews, and the victims responded favorably. If the above-mentioned case had focused on only one victim, it could not have been prosecuted without the victim's testimony. However, the teacher involved had molested several students, thus allowing the investigator, by the\" use of the trial-and-error method, time to develop culturally specific interviewing skills. The authors have identified the following interviewing~tech- niques which were successful during interviews with Navajo and Hopi victims. When interviewing Indian children, a confrontational posture should be avoided by not sitting directly in front of the child, but rather by taking a position slightly off to either.side. Direct eye con- tact should also be avoided. Avoiding eye contact and a heightened sense of personal space are normal reactions in the Navajo and Hopi cultures. An inexperienced investigator might interpret these behav- ioral patterns as an indication the child is not being truthful. Exact dates and times are often essential to successfully prose- cute an offender. The investigator may encounter some difficult,, accomplishing this task because time in the Indian culture is often expressed as day or night, by seasons or by ceremonial or religious events. Knowledge of special tribal ceremonies or religious events is a useful method to narrow the time frame within which the crime occurred or better understand the mind set of the victim. In one case, a Hopi male in his teens refused to be interxiewed by investigators. A week later a second attempt to interview him proved successful. Investigators later discovered the victim was reluctant to cooperate because he thought the content of the interview would become public, thus prohibiting his participation, for the first time, in an important tribal ceremony that was to be held the next day. Prior knowledge regarding specific tribal customs can usually be learned in a short period of time and can save the investigator hours of unnecessary work and frustration. The extended family plays an important role in Indian society. Grandparents have customarily assumed the responsibility of teach- ing their grandchildren the oral traditions of the tribe as well as crafts suchas woodcarving, beadwork, weaving, and pottery, making. A child often has numerous aunts, uncles, and/:ousins who provide support and guidance for the child during thegrowing years. It is not out of the ordinary, for a child to be shuttled back and forth between relatives who serve as'substitute parents (Fischlier 1985). Older sib- lings, sometimes very young themselves, are often given the responsi- bility of caring for younger brothers and sisters for long periods of time without adult supervision. This is believed to prepare the chil- I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I . \"- .-. - lOO .~lvtl:,t~lL..~l~ IJ~uI/-~IN IJUAKI P-KLY. ,~I~KINL ~ I~'-JZ I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I dren for their future roles as parents, as well as providing an immedi- ate child care function (Korbin 1980). The advantage of a community where almost everyone is related to or knows everyone else is that there are few secrets and, with per- sistence, the truth will become known. The disadvantage is that infor- marion regarding the investigation, . or other information of any con- sequence, is effectively disseminated throughout the community via what is commonly referred to as the \"moccasin telegraph.\" The inves- tigator must assume that from the onset of the investigation n6thing will remain confidential. In addition, the overwhelming experience of the authors has been that in a closed community environment the abused child may be pressured by parents or relatives to deny or change incriminating facts in an effort to protect a relative or the rep- utation of the family or clan. The members of the Victim's extended family can either enhance or impede an investigation. The investiga- tor's attitude plays an important role in gaining the support of family members. Research has found that sexually abused victims are more likely to come from poor and single-parent families (Fischlier 1985; Gail 1987). The research, however, does not take into account the fact that members of the extended family often substitute for absent or work- ing parents. In general, Indian communities are perceived to have a different standard of living than non-Indian communities. Man,, Native Americans exist and thrive under conditions that would be judged substandard by the surrounding majority culture. Many tradi- tional Navajo families still live in small, one-room homes with no electricity, running water, or other modern conveniences. Navajo families living under these conditions may not see themselves as poor based on tribal traditions. Nonetheless, the unemployment rate, depending on the location of the Indian community, can be as high as 70% (Fischlier 1985). High unemployment can significantly impact the family's ability to meet the financial requirements of even'day life and subject family members to added pressures. The investigator should note that, due to the financial condition of the victim or the victim's family, transportation to and from the courthouse may be problematic. In addition, the jury:s impression of the victim or wit- nesses may need to be considered if the victim does not have, or can not afford, clothing suitable for a courtroom setting. A Navajo Child abuse study found that 50% of abuse and 50% to 80% of neglect cases were alcohol-related, as compared to a 1-7% rate of occurrence in non-Indian communities (White 1977). The study did not indicate how many of the case studies were sexuallv related. but the results do indicate that alcohol is a significant contributing factor in all forms of child abuse. In some families, alcoholism has become a way of life. Alcohol dependence may also afflict many I ..\" .......... \u00a3 ........ ,. ! .............. :..:..: ................................................... INBJESTIGATING CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE 161 members of the extended family. Alcoholism severely disrupts the ability of the parents and members of the extended family to provide the child with traditional values, proper guidance, and support. Tribal governments may not have adequate resources to provide the required follow-up services for the victims of child abuse. The few qualified psychologists and social workers who are available have heavy caseloads and may not be able to offer the victim meaningful long-term therapy. More often than not, the investigator mu~t take responsibility to notify off-reservation social service agencies to obtain necessary assistance for the victims. This type of assistance is often available through victim/witness assistance programs on both the state and federal levels. In one instance, a federal victim/witness coordinator granted a unique request. A family adhering to Navajo traditional customs sent their son, a victim of sexual abuse, to a medicine man in order to have a purification ceremony performed. The family paid for the services of the medicine man with sheep. The coordinator recognized that these actions were in accordance with traditional Navajo customs and reimbursed the family for the sheep. The reimbursement mav seem unusual in the context of Anglo- American society, but the gesture was well received in the Indian community. It is essential that the victim and the victim's family be referred to professional counselors for long-term treatment of the problem. With proper psychological help, the victims will be less like- ly to abuse children when they become adults. Cross-cultural studies suggest that child abuse in a variety of cul- tures increased or became evident for the first time as the culture took steps toward acculturation (Korbin 1980). Over the past century., American Indian communities have experienced an erosion of tradi- tional values and lifestyle. Many Indian children are being raised in institutional settings. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) operates numerous boarding schools for Indian children. Children living in these institutional settings are isolated from the traditional family setting and may not have the proper parent modeling. Limited research suggests that boys living in institutional settings are at an increased risk of becoming victims of sexual abuse (Rimsza 1987). However, the study did not include girls living in institutional set- tings, and the available data are insufficient to accurately identi~\" any high risk subgroups. Over the past few years, it has become evident that the younger generations are rejecting, in increasing numbers, the traditional ways of their parents and grandparents. This rejection results in the loss of historical identity and a breakdown of the support systems provided by the extended family. As a result, parents left without effective fam- ily supports and coping mechanisms are prone to abuse their chil- dren (Gail 1987). In turn, a child who was abused during his child- I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I . .... I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I .'~o. 4. .'.. 162 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SPRING 1992 hood is more likely to abuse children as an adult (Gail 1987). Based on these findings, child sexual abuse in the Indian community may reach epidemic proportions in a few generations if the proper preven- tive steps are not taken in the near future. The authors have identified second-generation victims on the Navajo Indian Reservation. In one instance, a father, himself molest- ed by his non-Indian elementary school teacher, now has two sons who were molested by the same teacher a decade later. In the some vein, a thirty-two-year-old male Indian maintenance worker employed at a BIA boarding school was arrested for molesting five male students in their early teens. Less than two years later, one of the victims was discovered sexually molesting a younger male student in a BIA dormitory. The older student was placed into a counseling program, but, due to insufficient funding and a l~eavy caseload, the social worker was not able to adequately address the needs of the old- er student. The older student eventually became despondent, attempt- ed suicide and was subsequently transferred to a larger city to receive extensive treatment at an in-patient facility. One phenomenon that has been observed is that many Indian pedophiles were molested as children by non-Indian school teachers. The authors have also observed the arrest of a female child molester. The woman was a twenty-six-year-old non-Indian employee at a BIA boarding school located on the Navajo reservation. The woman was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to thirty months in a federal prison for sexually molesting a female student who lived in the BIA dormitory. The investigation revealed that several other female stu- dents living in the same dormitory were also targeted by the female offender; each victim was at a different stage in the seduction pro- cess. These observations have not been followed up by any scientific studies to determine if any general implications exist. Over a three-year period, investigations on the Navajo and Hopi Indian reservations have resulted in the arrest of five teachers for child molestation or related offenses. Of the five teachers arrested, two were non-Indian teachers teaching at BIA schools, two were non- Indian teachers teaching at state-operated schools on the reservation, and one was an Indian teacher teaching at a BIA school. The five teachers lived within a fifty-mile radius and had little if any contact with one another. The teachers were able to avoid detection for long periods of time, in one instance for eighteen years. The method of victimization used by each teacher is typified bv the following case. In 1979, a thirty-four-year-old, non-Indian male was employed by the BIA as an elementary school teacher on the Hopi Indian Reservation. The teacher established a nationally acclaimed reading program that enabled the students tO increase their reading scores dramatically. The teacher's acceptance into the Indian community .-,:.. 103 was signified by his participation in a religious \"hair washing\" cere- mony. The school administration, students, and community at large felt the teacher made outstanding contributions to the educational system on the reservation. After eight years of dedicated service, the teacher was arrested for child molestation. During that period of time, the teacher kept an accurate record of his sexual activities with 142 male students. This case is considered one of the most widespread instances of child molestation in U.S. history. Approximately one out of every twenty school-aged Hop~ /'ndian males was molested by this teacher. The last student named on the list, the most recent victim, was in the second grade, and the first name on the list, the oldest victim, is now in his early twenties. A majority of the students on the list came from poor, dysfunctional families. The teacher singled out these students and provided them with food, a place to stay, and, most importantly, affection. The stu- dents had their choice of dozens of video movies to see and games to play. The teacher took selected students to larger cities off the reser- vation and bought them clothes, shoes, and other items that the stu- dents' families could not afford to purchase. Gradually, over a period of two years, the teacher.seduced the students by first touching them in seemingly innocent ways. The teacher progressed to touching their genitals and eventually to anal intercourse. During the course of the investigation, it was revealed that two police reports had been filed previously and several complaints were directed to the principal's office alleging that the teacher was molesting students. The teacher was so well thought of that in each instance the teacher was exonerat- ed of any wrongdoing. In February. 1987, the teacher was arrested by the FBI and is currently, serving a life sentence in a North Carolina federal prison. Pursuant to an interview and correspondence between the teacher and the authors, the teacher readily admitted to sexually molesting the students but indicated his belief that the good he did for the Hopi Community far outweighed his transgressions. Shortly after the teacher's conviction, fifty-eight of the teacher's victims filed a law suit alleging that the BIA failed to prevent the teacher's misconduct. As part of the out-of-court settlement, fifty-sev- en victims ranging in age from nine to twenty-one and the mother of one victim who ultimately took his own life as a result of being molested will share a $46.5 million award. The settlement also estab- lished counseling and education funds to ensure long-term assistance for the victims and their families. In each case, the five teachers masked their pedophile\" activities so cleverly and developed such a good rapport with community mem- bers that the community was shocked and felt betrayed by the teach- ers. After the initial shock, most communities join forces and support the investigation and subsequent efforts to provide counseling for the I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I - \" ....... : .... 5.1 -~. : ................................ ~ ..... I 164 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SPRING 1992 I victims and their families; however, this is not always the case. The investigator must be acutely aware of the community's perception of the suspected pedophile and the investigation itself. The following I case is an example of how a community's negative reaction took the investigators by surprise. A fifty-year-old, non-Indian.male was employed as a middle I school teacher the The teacher on Navajo Indian Reservation. appeared to be very religious, with an excellent teaching record and a i reputation beyond reproach. The teacher taught at the same'sdhool for eighteen years. During that time, the teacher molested a large number of male students. The only known record of the teacher's vic- I tims were names and dates written on a closet door next to a height chart. The growth of scores of students could be traced by hatch- marks etched progressively higher on the door. The'teacher targeted I students who from dysfunctional families, and often came poor, sought parents' written permission to allow their sons to live at the i teacher's residence on a permanent basis. In several instances, the teacher was granted legal guardianship of the students. Most of the victims lived with the teacher from the time the), were five or six I years old. The investigators approached school administrators regarding the suspected teacher's pedophile activities. In less than an hour's time, the \"moccasin telegraph\" carried the news throughout I the school and the The school administration and teach- community. ers, predominantly non-Indian, rallied behind the suspected teacher i and, in light of the previous well-publicized investigations, accused the investigators of being on a \"witch hunt.\" The investigation was frequ6ntly hindered by the teacher's supporters. Opposition to the I investigation was subtle at first, but soon escalated to actions that bordered on obstruction of justice. One supporting teacher went so far as to file a false criminal complaint against one investigator. In I addition, the allowed only restricted to stu- investigators were access dents during school hours, causing the investigators to travel long i distances in an-attempt to locate and interview victims at home. Many victims could not be found easily because it is not uncommon for a child to reside with different members of the extended family I who live great distances from eac.h other. In addition, houses on the Navajo res:e~ation frequently do not have telephones or addresses and can only.be'f6tind rising landmarks t~or directions. Eventually, a I majority of the members of the Indian community pressured the school administration to cooperate with the investigation in-order to I resolve the crisis. Notwithstanding, the school administrators contin- ued to support the suspected teacher, which resulted in a division in the community generally along racial lines. At one point dining the I investigation, several Navajos who supported the accused teacher employed a medicine man to perform a ceremony that would protect ! ..... : ..................... .2.:_-- ...... ~,z ..... ~ ...~.:..:~..: ............................... INVESTIGATING CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE 165 the teacher and place a hex on the investigators to prevent them from continuing the investigation. When members of the Indian communi- ty who supported the investigation heard about this action, they, in turn, retained a more powerful medicine man to perform a ceremony to counteract the hex. The investigation was long and frustrating but resulted in the arrest and conviction of the teacher. The teacher is now serving a thirty-year sentence in a federal prison. The reaction of the community is an integral part of the investi- gation. The investigator may have to take time to educaie Ischool administrators and members of the community regarding the prob- lem of child molestation. If a child sexual abuse awareness program is not in place at the school, the investigator should encourage the school administration to establish one. As a direct result of the arrests of the five\" school teachers, the Navajo and Hopi tribal governments in conjunction with other feder- al agencies established child sexual abuse awareness programs for school aged children. Shortly after the awareness programs began, there was a noticeable increase in complaints of incest by students. Although these single-victim familial cases do not have the same political impact as a teacher molesting his students, the results are just as devastating. The extent of the incest problem on the Navajo and Hopi reservations is now becoming evident, and new resources must be allocated to address this problem. Interviewing a victim of child sexual abuse can be difficult in most Indian communities. The investigator must first obtain cultural information not readily accessible to outsiders before an effective interview can be conducted. Local tribal law enforcement agencies or social workers will usually provide the necessary, guidance to conduct a culturally correct interview. Background information regarding the victim, the offender, and the crime is as important as the interview itself because it provides a framework for the interxiew and allows the interviewer to become more comfortable with new ideas and per- spectives. Either a male or female can conduct effective interviews if the interviewer can demonstrate a sensitive and caring attitude toward the victim. In the case of an Indian victim, thought should be given to whether an Indian investigator should accompany a non-Indian investigator to interviews. In some cases, the presence of an Indian investigator will provide the victim with support and allow him or her to be more relaxed during the crisis period. However. in other instances, the presence of an Indian investigator may cause the vic- tim to be more inhibited. Since there are few secrets on a reservation. the victim may feel that details of the crime will not remain confiden- tial. The victim's sense of guilt, embarrassment, or shame may be heightened when the facts of the case are discussed in front of anoth- I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I i ..... I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I _ ...... . bFKINt.2 l ~Z er tribal member. Conversely, the non-Indian investigator may elicit similar negative emotions from the victim. The interviewers must be perceptive to the ongoing dynamics of the interview and be prepared to make changes if necessary. The best place to interview a victim is in a neutral setting. As a general rule, the interview should not be conducted in the same place where the crime occurred. The interview should also be conducted in privacy; however, in Indian communities this may not always be pos- sible. The victim's residence may be small, with many other relatives living in the home. Wherever the interview takes place, the setting should be comfortable for the victim as well as the interviewer. A researcher studied the reactions of sexually abused victims and observed that victims may react in one of two ways when interviewed (Rimsza 1987). With the first reaction, the victiiri may become very emotional, cry, express feelings of betrayal, or become outwardly embarrassed. The second reaction is a more controlled one. The vic- tim is calm, cool, and relates details of the assault in a seemingly emotionless manner. Seventy-nine percent of the male victims in the study displayed a controlled reaction, while female victims were divided equally among the controlled and the emotional reactions. The interviewer should also be aware that a victim may develop a strong emotional bond with the offender and vehemently deny having been sexually abused in an attempt to protect the offender. In many cases, presenting the victim with some type of tangible exhibit will loosen the bonds between the victim and the offender. The exhibit does not have to be of evidentiary value but sufficient to lend credibil- ity to the investigator's presentation of the facts. Investigators accustomed to using video cameras, pressure-acti- vated microphones, two-wav mirrors, and other aids may be disap- pointed, because few, if any, of these aids are available on most reser- vations due to the lack of funds to purchase this equipment. The investigator should bring along anatomically correct dolls or other necessary equipment. The authors have found that Indian victims seem to respond equally well when presented with dolls phenotypical- ly Indian or non-Indian. Anatomically correct dolls can be useful dur- ing interviews, especially when .the victims are young. However, investigators need not feel obligated to use the dolls, but should use them only when the victim cannot without difficulty verbalize the facts of the case. Permitting the victim to draw a picture and later discuss the picture is another nonverbal technique to facilitate com- munication. Once the initial flurry, of activity surrounding the investigation and subsequent judicial proceedings is over, the victims are left with the formidable task of reintegrating into the community. This process can be made easier, providing the community supports the victim. I \" \":-':': / ' :. \" ' \":'..\"i:':-.. \" \"~ .... \" . : \"\"::':;~\" \" : .............. INVESTIGATING CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE 167 The authors conducted informal post-investigation interviews with victims and teachers to assess the reintegration process. The teachers indicated that many of the victims suffered from a variety of psycho- logical trauma, including irritability, learning disorders, low self- esteem, and, in extreme cases, suicide attempts. One teacher observed that the victims were-often labeled as such and forced to form their own social subgroups. Several of the students who were interviewed felt they had been ostracized and were someh9w differ- . Ig ent because they had been victims of sexual molestatmn. One male student in his mid teens wanted to begin dating, but was experienc- ing anxiety regarding his sexual identity. The problems cited are only a few of the myriad of challenges the victims must learn to overcome. The investigator's responsibility ends with the prosecution of the offender, but the victim's pain continues lorig\" after the offender's prison sentence has been completed. The successful investigator must first understand local customs and traditions and then determine if a specific behavioral pattern is appropriate within that particular cultural context. Judgments should not be based on a single action but rather on a cluster of the offend- er's or victim's behavioral patterns. Most importantly, flexibility and common sense should be used when interviewing a victim of sexual abuse. What makes sense to the investigator may not always make sense to a victim with a different cultural background.

Permission has been granted from the authors to reprint it in its entirety.) I [ he National Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) Association has implemented a Tribal Court CASA Program designed to assist in the development and enhancement of tribal court programs that provide volun- i teer court-appointed special advocates (CASAs) for Native American children who have been abused or neglected. The overall goal of National CASA is to increase the i number of Indian children who are receiving culturally sensitive representation through indigenous CASA pro- grams in tribal court proceedings. There are currently 14 Tribal Court CASA programs. A I few of these programs have been in operation for years, but many are still in the planning stages. Some tribal court CASA programs serve one community; others serve i more than one community. Most programs provide vol- unteers only in tribal courts, but some provide volunteers in both tribal and state court. The tribal court CASA programs face many obstacles I that have previously inhibited the development of tribal court CASA programs. The current National CASA initia- tive is designed to assist tribal courts to develop the tools to overcome these obstacles. This initiative was imple- I merited in 1995 and many innovative policies and proce- dures have been identified which has been useful for the development of tribal court CASA programs. i The Tribal Court CASA project is assisted by an ad hoc Tribal Court Advisory Committee. The purpose of the advisory committee it to review and consult with Nation- al CASA on the development of Tribal court programs, the I best methods to assist the tribal court programs, and the best methods for adapting CASA to meet the needs of Native American communities. i A comprehensive Tribal Court CASA Meeting and a CASA Tribal Court Advisory Committee Meeting are held every year in connection with the National CASA confer- ence.

Overview of Triba[ Courts and a Historica[ Backdrop of Native American Child WeLfare Poticv In order to appreciate the need to adapt CASA for tribal courts, it is necessary, to provide a brief overview of tribal courts, the historical backdrop of Native American child welfare policy, and the Congressionally recognized need to have Native American child dependency cases heard in tribal courts. Of the more than 500 federally recognized Native American tribes and Alaska Native villages, more than 250 have operational tribal court systems. These courts exer- cise jurisdiction over nearly 70 million acres throughout the country - some in remote locations and other in, or near, urban areas. The tribes themselves vary, widely from the Navajo Nation with more than 200,000 members to bands with fewer than 100 members. Indian tribes possess the inherent sovereign power to \"make their own laws and be ruled by them\" (Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S. 217 [1959]). As Congress reiterated in enact- ing the Indian Tribal Justice Act of 1993 (25 U.S.C. 3601), \"tribal justice systems are an essential part of tribal gov- ernments and serve as important forums for ensuring public health and safety and the political integrity, of tribal governments.\" Tribal courts vary significantly from tribe to tribe. For example, the Navajo Nation court system processes nearly 100,000 cases per year while smaller tribal courts may hear less than 50 cases per year. Other tribal courts, espe- cially in Alaska and the Pueblos of New Mexico, still operate as traditional courts. Many tribal courts have court-annexed traditional or peacemaking court forums. Even those tribal courts which appear similar to non- Indian courts often incorporate tribal customs and tradi- tions in ways which distinguish them from their non-Indian counterparts. These traditional components may include use of Native language, introduction of cus- tomary or common law, a more holistic approach to dispute resolution, inclusion of tile extended family, more fluid communication, invocation of the spiritual realm in ceremonies/prayer, comprehensive problem solving, focus on reparative and restorative justice, and use of customary sanctions. It is also necessary to understand the historical back- drop of Native American child welfare policy. Beginning in the 1800s, the United States implemented an oppres- sive assimilationist policy towards Native Americans and Native American children in particular - forcibly taking Native American children from their homes and sending them to boarding schools where they were severely pun- i.shed for speaking their Native languages and practicing Native customs and religious practices. In more recent years, the removal of Native American children from their homes continued, but more often the children were placed in non-Indian foster care and adop- tive homes at an increasingly alarming rate rather than boarding schools. For example, in 1974, 2S% to 3S% of all Native American children were in some type of out-of- home placement. In response to this extraordinarily high number of out-of-home placements of Native American children, Congress passed the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) in 1978 (2S U.S.C. 1901-1963). As the ICWA Congressional findings concluded: I) that an alarmingly high percentage of Indian fami- lies are broken up by the removal, often unwarrant- ed, of their children from them by nontribal public and private agencies and that an alarmingly high percentage of such children are placed in non- Indian foster and adoptive homes and institutions, and 2) that the States, exercising their recognized jurisdic- tion over Indian child custody proceedings through administrative and judicial bodies, have often failed to recognize the essential tribal relations of Indian people and cultural and social standards prevailing in Indian communities and families. ICWA dearly recognized that \"there is no resource that is more vital to the continued existence and integri- ty of Indian tribes than their children.\" In order to protect the best interests of Native American children and to promote the stability and security of Native Amer- ican tribes and families, Congress set forth two basic jurisdictional and procedural requirements. First, ICWA provides that whenever possible, Native American child dependency cases should be heard in tribal courts where it is presumed that the essential tribal relations and the prevailing cultural and social standards will be respected. Second, for those cases which remain in state courts, ICWA provides a series of procedural safeguards which are designed to address the historic failures of the state court systems to protect Native American children. Training and Technica[ Assistance Needs The Tribal Court CASA Program includes a significant training and technical assistance component which is designed to the assist the current grant programs to achieve their program goals and objectives. Moreover, it is designed to, develop .train!.n.g and technica!assistance. _\" Tribal Court CASA Programs The following is a listing of 14 current tribal court CASA programs.

An extensive needs assessment process has been con- ducted of the 10 tribal court CASA programs which received funding in the 1997-1997 funding cycle. This n needs assessment process identified numerous barriers faced by tribal court CASA programs such as: ll Complex relationships that exist between federal, m state, and tribal agencies; Jurisdictional limitations (including the lack of crim-~ inal jurisdiction over non-Indians and the effects of Public Law 280); Problems with state court recognition of tribal court 1 orders; Isolated location of most reservations (which pre- sents problems in getting services to the community st and necessitates substantial travel for CASA volun- teers and staffi: Protec6m Children o Volume 14 Number 1 e Page 1 I ,, II II Turnover/turmoil as result of tribal elections; I I Lack of community awareness concerning CASA; Difficulty in adapting a non-Indian program to meet the needs of individual Indian communities; Difficulty coordinating with state agencies/programs; I [] Difficulty, in promoting a volunteer program in communities with high poverty and unemployment rates; and I [] The critical need for Indian-specific resources and program materials. Moreover, the needs assessment process identified and I prioritized the training and technical needs of the tribal court CASA programs. I Adaptation Issues - Innovative Polities and Procedures I I I I The following is a partial listing of critical issues con- ceming tribal court CASA adaptation and innovative policies and procedures which are being developed by tribal court CASA programs: II How to Organize Tribal Court CASA Programs: There have been substantial discussions concerning whether a tribal court CASA program should be a private nonprofit organization or a tribal agency and, if a tribal agency, how it fits in the tribal gov- ernmental structure. It is clear that this is critical decision which must be made early in the planning phase and that the factors involved in making the decision will vary from community to community. I [] I I. I I I I How to Recruit Native American Volunteers: There have been continual discussions concerning this critical issue. Many different solutions have been discussed, including community education, brochures/posters, tribal newsletters, tribal resolu- tions, adding CASA provisions to the tribal code, and utilizing students from tribal community col- leges as CASA volunteers. Tribal Resolutions on CASA: On many Indian reservations, the largest employer is the tribe itself. The tribe may hire employees to perform various tribal functions and also to work in tribal enterpris- es, including tribal gaming enterprises. Consequent- ly, one of the innovative recruitment policies recommended for the tribal court CASA programs coricerns working with the tribal government to enact tribal resolutions endorsing the CASA program and giving tribal employees time off from their jobs as tribal employees to perform CASA duties. I Obtaining Credit at Tribal Colleges for CASA Vol- unteers: The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Program (Montana) suc- cessfully worked with the Salish Kootenai College to r II - recruit and train students as CASA volunteers and pro- vided college credit for these students. This program has been very effective and many of the tribal court C.~A programs are planning to replicate the Flathead program through their own tribal colleges. Incorporating Tribal Custom and Tradition: There has been continual discussions concerning the criti- cal issue of incorporating tribal custom and tradition into the tribal court CASA programs. Recommenda- tions concerning this issue have included providing volunteer training on tribal custom and tradition and traditional child rearing'rrlethods, use of tribal language whenever appropriate,, use of peacemak- ing/traditional dispute resolution methods, and use of other traditional methods such as family group conferences. [] Involvement of Tribal Elders: There have also been extensive discussions concerning the related issue of involving tribal elders in the tribal court CASA pro- grams as trainers, volunteers, board members, and program promoters. Tribal elders may have difficulty with some of the writing and/or oral advocacy aspects of the CASA role. Consequently, some pro- grams are experimenting with more supportive efforts of tribal elders such as tape recording of oral recommendations/reports which are then included in a written report prepared by program staff and other types of report writing assistance. Moreover, the idea of partnering tribal elders on CASA volun- teer team with a younger volunteer (such as tribal college student) is being developed. Traditional Proof'am Name/Logo: Some of the pro- grams have decided to use traditional concepts and/or word(s) from their tribal language for the program name of the tribal court CASA program. Other programs have developed traditional program logos. For example, the Grand Traverse CASA Program has developed a program logo which uti- lized tribal custom and tradition to illustrate the CASA program. The Grand Traverse logo includes a bear which represents good medicine stepping in to protect children - like the tribal justice system steps in to protect children. Moreover, the logo represents that the CASA volunteer has to have the same quali- ties as the bear in order to perform their role - the CASA volunteers have to be brave and strong and they can draw upon the strength of the bear to fulfill their role. [] Volunteer Training: The volunteer training discus- sions have focused upon possible training resources (such as state CASA programs), specific tribal c~urt training needs (such as training concerning Indian law and jurisdictional issues), and the need to include tribal custom and tradition issues in a'... ~Jol- unteer training (including the use of tribal eTc, ; as trainers). [] Small Tribal Community Issues: There hz', extensive discussions concerning the spec'.\" Paoe T2 e Volume 14 Number 1 e Protectin\u00a2 Children I1 Ill issues/problem areas facing tribal court CASA pro- grams. Some of these issues are related to the nature of a small rural communit T where everyone knows each other, but other issues are relative to the specif- ic nature of Native American communities. Two issues have been discussed extensively. First, the general consensus has been that the nature of most tribal communities makes it very difficult for tribal court CASA programs/volunteers to maintain the strict role boundaries generally set forth for CASA programs. Second, the nature of most tribal commu- nities (except very, large tribes or those tribes with geographically separated communities) makes it impossible to only assign volunteers to cases in which they do not know the parties. Instead, the tribal court CASA programs are developing an alter- nate method for screening volunteer assignments. Resources/Funding: There is continuing need for more tribal court CASA resources, especially Native American-specific resources. Moreover, there is a continuing need to develop funding strategies to meet the specific needs of the tribal court CASA programs. Future Direction .. A series of technical assistance resources are being i planned and developed to assist current and developin-.. .-- Tribal Court CASA pregrams.

A Court Appointed Special Advocate I (CASA) volunteer is a trained citizen who is appointed by a judge to represent the best interests of a child in court. Children helped by CASA volunteers include those I for whom home placement is being determined in juvenile courL Most of the children are victims of abuse and neglect. I ~/hat is the CASA volunteer's role? I A CASA volunteer provides a judge with carefully researched background of the child to help the court make a sound decision about that child's future. Each I home placement case is as unique as the child involved. The CASA volunteer must determine if it is in a child's best interests I to stay with his or her parents or guardians, be placed in foster care, or be freed for permanent adoption. The CASA i volunteer makes a recommendation on placement to the judge, and follows through on the case until it is permanently resolved. I How does a CASA volunteer investigate a case? I To prepare a recommendation, the CASA volunteer talks with the child, parents, i family members, social workers, school officials, health providers and others who are knowledgeable about the child's I history. The CASA volunteer also reviews all records pertaining to the child -- school, medical and case worker reports; and other documents. I I I How does a CASA volunteer differ from a social service caseworker? Social workers generally are employed by state governments. They sometimes work on as many as 60 to 90 cases at a time and are frequently unable to conduct a comprehensive investigation of each. The CASA worker is a volunteer with more time and a smaller caseload (an average of 1-2 cases at a time). The CASA volunteer does not replace a social worker on a case; he or she is an independent appointee of the court. The CASA volunteer can thoroughly examine a child's case, has knowledge of community resources, and can make a recommendation to the court indepen- dent of state agency restrictions. How does the role of a CASA volunteer differ from an attorney? The CASA volunteer does not provide legal representation in the courtroom. That is the role of the attorney. However, the CASA volunteer does provide crucial background information that assists attorneys in presenting their cases. It is important to remember that CASA volunteers do not represent a child's wishes in court. Rather, they speak to the child's best interests. Is there a \"tvoical\" CASA volunteer?. v- CASA volunteers come from all walks of life, with a variety of professional, educational and ethnic backgrounds. There are more than 38,000 CASA volunteers nationally. Local programs vary in number of volunteers they utilize. Aside from their CASA volunteer work, 52 percent are employed in regular full-time jobs; the majority tend to be professionals. 82% of the volunteers nationwide are women; 18% are men. How does the CASA volunteer relate to the child he or she reores0qt~? \"IL CASA volunteers offer children trust and advocacy during complex legal proceedings. They explain to the child the events that are happening, the reasons they all are in court, and the roles the judge, lawyers, and social workers play. CASA volunteers also encourage the child to express his or her own opinion and hopes, while remaining objective observers. How many cases on the average does ~l CASA volunteer carry at a time? The number varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but an average caseload is one to two. Do lawyers, iudoes and social caseworkers SUOOOrt CASA? Yes. Juvenile and family court judges implement the CASA program in their courtrooms and appoint volunteers. CASA has been endorsed by the American Bar Association, the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention of the U.S. Department of Justice. Does the federal aovemment suooort CASA? CASA is a pdority project of the Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. The office encourages the establishment of new CASA programs, assists established CASA programs, and provides partial funding for the National CASA Association. -more- I How manv CASA oroorams are there? There are now 642 CASA programs in all 50 states, Washington DC and the U.S. Virgin Islands. New programs start up at the average of three or four per month. How effective have CASA Preliminary findings show that children who have been assigned CASA volunteers tend to spend less time in court and less time within the foster care system than those who do not have CASA representation. Judges have observed that CASA children also have better chances of finding permanent homes than non-CASA children. How much time does it reouir0? Each case is differenL A CASA volunteer usually spends about 10 hours doing research and conducting interviews pdor to the first court appearance. More complicated cases take longer. Once initiated into the system, volunteers work about 10-15 hours a month. Are there any other agencies or 0roups that provide the same service? No. There are other chiid advocacy organizations, but CASA is the only program where volunteers are appointed by the court to represent a child's best interests. What children are assigned CASA volunteers? Children who are victims of abuse and neglect who have become wards of the court are assigned CASA volunteers. The program is most common in juvenile and family court cases. What is the role of the National CASA Association? The National CASA Association is a non- profit organization that represents and serves the local CASA programs. It provides training, technical assistance, research, media and public awareness services to members. How is CASA funded? How can I find the CASA Drogrpm in mv community? CASA programs are known by a variety of names, including Guardian ad Litem, ProKids, Child Adv, Pc,~tes , Inc., and Voices for Children, to name a few. If you cannot find a program in your area, contact the National CASA Association for referral. How do I oet more information about becomino a CASA volunteer or ioininq the National CASA Association?

The volunteer continues until the case is permanently resolved. One of the primary benefits of the CASA program is that, unlike other court principals who often rotate cases, the CASA volunteer is a consistent figure in the proceedings, and provides continuity for a child. At the local level, CASA programs are generally funded through a state's department of justice. Many programs are privately funded through service organizations such as the Junior League and the National Council of Jewish Women. The National CASA Association is funded through a combination of pdvate grants, federal funds (U.S. Justice Department), memberships and contributions. i I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I ! i I 7 th Indian Nations Conference Successful Prosecution of Sexual Assault Cases: An Advocates' Perspective Dana Farabee Tulsa, Oklahoma 1999 m mmm mmmm m m m u m m m m m m m m n n m m I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 7 th Indian Nations Conference \"Successful Prosecution of Sexual Assault Cases: An Advocates' Perspective\" Danna Farabee Learning Objectives: 1.

Kenneth Hodder, LISW In this workshop, I would like to share some ideas about the treatment of Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder derived from recently developed successful therapeutic approaches. Over thirty years of outcome studies tell us that successful psychotherapies~all have common elements. A supportive relationship, and a motivated client being the major ingredients. Dr. Bruce Perry, in his extensive work on Post-Traumatic Stress Disordered children, convincingly demonstrates the wisdom of this knowledge in his discussions of the physiological states of traumatized children. In his work with traumatized children, Dr. Perry used heart rate monitoring to establish the arousal rates of the children and came to numerous significant findings about treatment. He argues that of necessity, one must interact with children at the level their arousal state allows. Perry gives the example of asking a child to come to his car to get something. The child became unresponsive. Perry noticed that the child's heart rate had increased dramatically. After looking further into the child's case, he realized he had unwittingly triggered a response associated with molestation by a relative who regularly abused him in his car. Perry and others talk about the importance of recognizing the inherent power difference between adults and children, and I would argue (despite my daily experience with my own teenager), that the power difference is inherently coercive and requires the clinican's careful consideration. Perry recommends therapies which involve ceremony, movement and communal support for the child rather than styles which may by their nature elicit disabling levels of neurological arousal. Treatment goes nowhere without sensitivity to the child's level of arousal. Long before I understood the neurophysiology of this reality, I practiced with the principle that no one could be worked with effectively in therapy until they felt safe. In my work with both children and adults, I have been using elements of some recently developed therapeutic tools. The most important of these I will address today. To relieve traumatic dreams and flashbacks which are a typical part of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, I am using a model developed at the University of New Mexico which involves the integration of the recurring dream or I Page 2 Clinical Notes on P.T.S.D. flashback into a narrative account. The client uses the dream or flashback imagery as the stem of a story which they are asked to reframe in a positive, or at least less upsetting, light. A case exam]hie might be helpful here. Laura, a thirty-two year old woman who was injured when her vehicle was broadsided and rolled, experienced a dark looming presence over her shoulder anytime she drove on a freeway after the accident. While she knew there was nothing there, she found herself pulling her car away from the 'presence', often drifting into another lane and causing danger to herself and other drivers. I asked her to imagine the scenario and make the presence become something which made sense to her. She chose to see a truck overtaking her, a common and mildly arousing experience driving on freeways. Although this experience had been troubling Laura almost daily for the preceeding three months, after just one session in which Laura added a benign ending to her experience, she was no longer bothered by the symptom. I used an adapted E.D.M.R. procedure to augment the positive narrative, and after a two year follow up, there have been no further problems. In the case of recurring dreams or nightmares, the procedure usually involves writing down all that is remembered of the dream and modifying the ending in some way such that the dream is less upsetting. Joey is an eight year old who was sexually and physically abused by his parents, and is being raised in a foster family. He began having dreams of his mother in which she was angry with him and threatened to harm him. Because he is a poor writer and reader, I helped him to =change the dream\" so that his mother came to check on him because she was worried about him, not angry, but upset that he was not feeling good. We talked about this \"reframing\" or ending, Joey liked it and agreed to have his foster mother read it to him before he went to bed a few times a week. After three weeks, the upsetting dream no longer reocurred. In the case of flashbacks of actual events or of upsetting memories, I often use E.M.D.R. or some aspect of it such as desensitization processes, combined with an =eidetic\" imagery to defuse the emotional impact of the event. I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I Page 3 Clinical Notes on P.T.S.D. In my use of E.M.D.R. and Eidetics, I try to access the negative cognition which is often married to the trauma or some aspect of it. As you are aware, the assumption in cognitive therapy suggests that there are counter- productive cognitions or cognitive styles which have negative consequences for clients. For example, Sally, a forty-two year old woman who came to treatment feeling suicidal after her father died, reported significant emotional abuse as a child by her mother who called Sally stupid, daily, and cut all of her hair off on one occasion after Sally had been sick and her father chose to stay home and nurse her. These recollections came up in using E.M.D.R. and were associated with self-concepts of being stupid and ugly and also associated with tremendous guilt. Sally had for many years been promiscuous and had been imprisoned for drug use, behaviors which she used to =deaden [her] pain and prove [her] worth\". In treatment, she was able to improve her self-concept and self-esteem by using imagery of positive interactions with her mother, primarily involving her standing up for herself in a strong and assertive fashion. After six sessions, although with a long way to go, Sally reported her feeling of being stupid, which she initially rated (on a scale of 1-10) at 10 was down to 3, and she had managed to keep from drinking for eight weeks, at the time of this writing, something she had not managed in the past five years. At the community level, for the optimum adjustment, the conditions of a supportive, loving, community are required. In the case of physical abuse, this ideal is often lacking as children and adults are most often abused by someone in their support network. Frequently, protective intervention initiates further abuse or maltreatment in retaliation, by people in the child's or adult's support network, or by an insensitive and imperfect system. It is imperative that everyone who is abused, but most importantly, children, be engaged in healing care in the midst of a supportive network. I have included in this handout a model for use in Indian Nations which was first developed by clinicians of the Navajo Tribe and was used with some success.

Tribes have noted some of the unique issues they face in providing safety to victims of gang violence and/or to ~oano~, members who want to get out. These include the lack of providing \"safe houses\" on the reservation where victhns or ex-gang members can live until the danger they face is subdued. On most reservations, everyone knows everyone and where the), live, tl~e lack of anony]lfity creates problems for safety and protection. Gang affiliation also threatens the make up of extended families because it transcends familial and clan boundaries and sets up conflicting relationships by pitting family and clan members against one another. This type of intra-tribal violence places a burden on tribes to devdop innovative responses, l Tribes are now faced with a completely new reality and need to mobilize to design responses to interdict the growth and operations of gangs and the impact on commtmity protection. Most gang-related crimes are property crimes. Although not as serious as violent crime, acts such as breaking into homes and theft instill fear and insecurity in community members. The elderly and young children appear to be particularly easy targets of gang t Melton, Ada (1997) Final Focus Group Report: Victims of Gang Violence in Native American Cora.n\u00a2nities. U.S. Departnlent of Justice, Office for Victims Of Crime in Washington. D.C. crime because the 3 , cannot adequately protect themselves and are more likely to submit to gang intimidation. The elderly are frequently' victims of ~oano,~ violence, theft, and properly crimes. By contrast, juveniles are more liken to be intimidated by and press~et:t to join oanos and once members, to commil crimes. Data about victims of other crimes'-, such as domestic violence and child physical ,and sexual abuse, reveal that Indian victhns face considerable obstacles to obtaining sen'ices. including: Delayed law elfforcement response to violent crime Lengthy investigations Absent or poor prosecution of cases Lack of inunediate medical care .~1 absence of on-reservation \"safe houses\" and Inseltsitivity to ctdtural needs of victints and witnesses by federal, slate. and tribal service providers. [~/IQUE ISSUES OF GANG VICTIMI ZATION IN INDIAN COM~il_~q~rl TIES Victim issues in Indian conununities need to be understood at multiple levels because the impact of gang violence and victhnizalion extends not only to individual victims, but to families, conmaunities, and the tribes. In addition, Indian gangs catmot be understood without referencing the lfistorical experience of all Indian people. The impact of relocation. genocide, mad cultural oppression by the larger society, over four centuries has contributed greatly to the social problems Findings referred to under the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Act of 1990 (Public Law. 101-630). wlfich was enacted to addre~ the maltreatment of Indian children, cited under-reporting, child sexual abuse, and inadequate funding as areas for refomt such as gang violence in Indian conununities today 3. Issues that Impact In&an Victims Limited resources /or victims. Most tribes are located in remote or rural areas. This tends to narrow the kinds of resources capable of reaching a tribal commtmity, or conversely, that can be provided by the tribe itself. Victims, who generally live in the same communities as offenders or gang members, often are not willing or able to relocate within or outside it. In addition, man 3 , do not possess the f'mancial and family resources to leave the community entirely. Elderly victims are especially reluctant to leave and do not seek victim assistance for fear of being asked to leave their homes. Nonetheless, victims rather than offenders often are removed from the reser~,ation or are pressured into leaving for the sake of safer), and protection. This explicit compronaising of victims' rights erodes citizen confidence in the ability of tribal response systems to offer safety and protection to its citizens. Fearing that their needs c,'mnot be met on the reservation, many tribal citizens withdraw from the community. Lack of system reliabili~. Inadequate f'mancial support for law enforcement sen'ices in Indian commtmities inhibits timely police response to crime and undermines protection and assistance for victims. Victims and witnesses are reluctant to report, because the lag time creates opportunities for gang intimidation and retaliatory tactics. System reliability is further hindered by poor coordination of and minimal commtmication among various tribal, state, and federal entities that become involved with victims in violent gang-related cases. Communication gaps also exist among components of tribal response systems, such as law enforcement, tribal courts, and social sen, ices, and with families. As a result, victims are unsure of where to go for assistance in case processing, notification 3 Indeed. sonic focus group participants referred to Indian gang members themselves as victims--disempowered youth for whom gang membership is a method of survival mid coping. for court appearances, infomlation about the offender, or for compensation and other types of victim assistance. Lack of knowledge and victim-blaming. Some commtmities appear to lack an awareness and tmderstanding of gang violence. Communities often overlook or discount the needs of victims of cane violence because they cannot distinguish ~an~ violence from other kinds of violence (inclu~lg domestic violence). The burden for individuals victimized by their own gang- identified family, members is even greater. These individuals are seen as contTibuting to their own victimization by accepting or tolerating the violence that is committed by their children or extended family who are ~an~o o members. Limited training for service providers. Tribal police, social sen'ices, probation, and other court-related service providers often receive little or no training about the d?ammics of ~an~o o violence and may not recoonize specific crimes as gang-related. Further, they may fail to understand the specific needs of victhns of gang violence or to provide adequate assistance to them. Issues Impacting Indian Families Influence from the dominant society. Influence from non-Indian cultures and lifestyles, along with negative peer influence, have diminished the authorily of parents to discipline their children and to instill in them the cultural values, lifestyle, and traditions of tribal communities. Most destructive to the extended Indian family have been historical govemment policies that are desi~ed to assimilate trims into society at large. Policies such as the reservation system, temfination of federally recognized tribal status, boarding schools, and relocation programs have contributed to an erosion of cultural heritage that continues to influence Indian people today. Lack of involvement with educational systems. Most public school systems do not support Native .american cultural values even when the majority of students are Native American. As a result, parents and students I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I feel alienated from the educational system and perceive themselves as unable to initiate or influence change, such as demanding curricula that address the needs of Indian youth in academic, cultural, and other social and behavioral areas. The lack of an affh-mafive education is a key factor in Indian children dropping out of school. The dropout rate for Indian youth ages 16 to 19 years old is 18 percent, a full eight percent higher than the national averageJ Youth who drop out of school are more likely to join subculture groups, such as gangs. Multi-problem families. Existing family problems such as unemployment, alcoholism. domestic violence, and child abuse and neglect, are also factors in youth susceptibility to ~an~s.o o The needs of crime victinas with such pre-existing problems often are ignored, especially if those problems or the needs of the family appear to be more urgent. Issues Impacting Indian Tribal Communities Lack of education and awareness. Some tribes have organized multi-disciplinary planning groups that are working to empower the community through education and awareness campaigm, mentorship programs for youth, and strategies to prevent or Suppress gang activity. However, the rapid infdtration of gangs into tribal communities has left many tribes unprepared to respond to gang-related crime and violence. Some tribes have minimized gat~g problems in their communities by categorizing youth who display gang-like behavior as \"wannabes.\" However, the perception that gangs are somehow an \"accepted\" or benign .subculture that others simply want to join makes communities more vulnerable to gang entry. Problems that could be best dealt with when they are small and more manageable, through prevention or intervention, are ignored. Youth who are considered \"wannabes,\" usually the 4 Snyder H. And M.

Without the tribal conmltmity as a partner, tribal response systems cannot effectively impose sanctions, rehabilitate offenders, allay victims concerns, or protect the public. Lack of leadership. Victims and tribal citizens do not demand accountability by tribal leaders to address the gang problems in their communities. To demonstrate a conunitted concern for victim fights and needs, it is essenti,'d for tribal leaders institutionalizing viclhn assistance prog~uns. Not only must tribal leaders hold offenders accotmtable for criminal behavior, they must model zero tolerance for violence in their own lives and in their community. Holding offenders accountable is a critical element in the restorative justice approach that is inlaerent in most tribal justice systems. 5 Prejudice. The close-knit nature of many tribal conmaunities can create negative The balanced and restorative justice approach in mainstream society consists of three related objectives: community protection, accountability, and competency developtr~nt of youth who enter the juvenile justice system. In tribal justice systems the restorative justice approach refers to the process used to handle juvenile crime eases through which file victim and offender, smrounded by their family members, confront each other to resolve conflicts. This holistic approach promotes problem solving in a non-adversarial manner and addresses the healing needs of the victim, the offender, and their families. See also, A.P. Melton, h~igenous Justice Systems and Tribal Socie~ in Indian Tribal Courts and Justice, Judieatttre, November-December. 1995 Vol. 79, No. 3. I experiences for victims from fanlilies with highly visible social problems (e.g.. alcoholism, domestic violence, unemployment. sin#e parenthood, etc.). Victims from other tribes or non-tribal communities may encounter similar attitudes. Sometimes offenders who have more power or status in a tribe actually receive more support than the victims they have harmed. Prejudice from outside the tribe hinders the ability of Indian victims to access available resources. Indian people who must rely on non-Indian resources often are refused services because of the perception held by non-Indian agencies that all \"Indian problems\" are the responsibility of the BIA or the Indian Health Service (IHS). Geographic location. Today Indian people are finding success and prosperity working for their tribal governments or tribal- owned businesses, or as entrepreneurs. contradicting the notion that an Indian person must leave the reservation in order to prosper. However, the rural nature and geographic isolation of many tribes continues to strain existing resources and to limit the influx of new ones. Depressed tribal econonlies and limited emplo2ranent opporttmities deprive tribes of a sustainable tax base from wlfich to fund needed services. Issues Impacting Tribal Response Systems Minimal support for tribal systems or for local solutions to local problems. Support for tribes is weakened by the image or belief by insiders and outsiders that Indian people cannot handle their own problems. This promotes the idea that solutions and model programs need to be imported to deal with tribal problems that are similar to problems in mainstream society. While the problems may be similar, solutions need to be designed within the tribal context. Mainstream models for handling crime problems need to be adjusted before the), are applied to problems m Indian Communities. Tribes need to address problems from their perspective and the solutions they design need to be supported. The historical imposition of constitutional governments to replace indigenous governmental structures has caused continuing problems for many tribes. Most have not completely converted to or accepted the underlying \"separation of powers\" doctrine that provides the framework for tripartite govenmlents with executive. le#slative. ,and judicial branches of government. As a result, in tribal 'cohununities with constitutional governments, the judicial branch coltstantly struggles to maintain or obtain autonomy from the other two branches of government. For victims, conflict arises when representatives from either the legislative or executive branch interfere (usually at the request of the contending plaintiff) by assez~ing tribal autbori~, and overriding or ,'unending the judicial process or outcomes. Limited infrastnmture. The basic need to build ilffrastructure includes system development such as law and order codes: stabilizing recun'ing ftmds for basic operations ,and expansion: program development; and facility development. Weak or absent ilffrastructure impedes the abiliB, of tribal response systems to develop effective victim assistance and advocacy programs. This makes tribes more prone to accepting programs that have been designed by criminal justice experts outside Indian country and that are often culturally ilmppmpfiate. Many such programs are experimental and as a result, Indian people often are left with the impression that their conlmunities are viewed merely as laboratories for social scientists. Some communities have responded with innovative approaches. For exmnple, some tribes have designated housing inhabited by Indian eiders as drug-free zones, and some have even demanded that entire tribal conmltmities or reservations be designated as such. In other tribal cormnunities, tribally controlled public housing is made available for the relocation of victims and their families. Still other tribal comlcils have beam to institutionalize assistance services for crime victims, induding victims of g,'mg climes. Tribes are ,also making efforts to empower younger members to employ tribal concepts of law and justice. I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I ..:1 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I Limited financial resources and direct funding streams. Man3: tribes have neither a sufficient tax base nor enough reliable profit- making enterprises to provide f'mancial support for community programs. Such depressed tribal econon'~es rely substantially on state and federal financial assistance. Unlike the states, tribes do not receive fommla grant funds directly from the federal government. Tribes must instead go through the state which subjects them to be treated like a local unit of state government in order to access federal funds. Under federal law, tribes are sovereign nalions. The current situation undermines tribal sovereignty and in essence violates the govenunent-to-gov emment relationship between the tribes and the Federal govemment. Trainotg and technical assistance. State and federal granting agencies provide little or no funding support to tribes to strengthen or revive indigenous systems of law and justice that could address crime in Indian communities. Federal and state granting agencies usually require concrete explanations of proposed pro~'ams, and tribes may have difficulty articulating how proposed systems will work. Information about grants and other types of training and technical assistance resources is available through non-governmental organizatio.ns. Nonetheless, tribes frequently receive inconsistent information about available training and technical assistance from state and federal agencies. As a result, tribes often are uninformed about what is available or about changes that occur in federal and state programs over time. Lack of long-term and comprehensive solutions. Violent crime often results in long- term trauma and injury to victims and their families. The absence of long-term sen'ice and advocacy programs within the tribal comlntmity hinders the ability of victims to heal physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually. In some cases, victim trauma may actually be prolonged. However, long-term solutions require a continuum of care and services model that is non-existent in most tribal connnunities. Limited experience at administrative levels. Elected or appointed tribal govenmaent officials often are unprepared to run govermnental or public affairs when they, assume office. Most do not have prior experience or training as public administrators or public officials. Tiffs. coupled with the short tinae they serve, limits what they can accomplish for their conrmunities. As a result, \" c/mmmni~' members and those outside the commmli~' may have little respect for tribal officials and may label them as incompetent, uncaring, or unwilling to help. A related point is tribal experience with extemal political systems. Tribes have little control over the federal process and lack sufficient political power to influence it. Tribes often ,are unaware of political, changes at the federal level that affect them. such as the disbanding of offices specifically established to address Native Americ,'m concerns. Jurisdictional colliers. In many cases. overlapping legal jurisdictions render Native Americans sinmltaneously subject to tribal. state, and federal criminal jurisdictions. Offenses that occur off tribal lands often me not conunttnicated to tribes or victims and their families. Furthermore, Indian offenders and victims in mainstream law-and-order- systems are often subject to \"assembly .line justice\" that is insensitive to their unique social, cultural, and linguistic needs. Prescribed penalties limit opportunities for appropriate attention to the cultural or individual needs of victims, offenders, or the tribal communities. Sensitivity and respect may be absent, and as a result, victim trauma may be increased. Dependence on external processes and authorities. The reluctance of federal agents to share their investigative findings when federal prosecution is declined hinders the efforts of tribes to investigate and prosecute crime. Although tribes have concurrent jurisdiction over felonies, they often delay tribal prosecution pending the outcome of Federal case proceedings. In either case, delays or gaps in information may lead to a lag hi the provision of victim services and to prolonged or secondary victim trauma. i Lack of communication, coordination. and collaboration. A general lack of conununication between internal and external agencies at all phases of case processing hinders tracking and monitoring offenders, as well as victim notification of case proceedings and outcomes. For example, acts of gang violence committed in public schools often are handled by the school system independent of any input or participation from tribal justice systems. This is a lost opportunity for tribes to intervene early on when problems can still be contained, violence can be averted, and students can remain in school. Limited options. Most tribes do not operate or have access to detention or correctional facilities, and many do not have operational probation and aftercare programs. As a result, tribes cannot impose certain and inmlediate sanctions on violent offenders, nor can they ensure victim safety. In the absence of alternatives, offenders are not held accountable to their victims, and victhns ,are left unprotected. ,an important consideration in the scope of tribal sentencing power is the Indian Civil Rights Act, wlfich prohibits tribes from imposing sanctions that exceed one year in jail and/or a $5.000 fine. As a result, tribal courts are tmable to impose sentences that are commensurate with the severity of violent crimes committed by gangs. The sanctions thus have no deterrent effect, and offenders continue their criminal behavior. Some tribes have adopted comnmnity service, such as painting over graffiti or repairing damaged property, as a sentencing option for some gang offenders. This option demonstrates offender accountability to victims and conmlunity while also sending the message, through highly visible public service, that crime will not be tolerated. It also allows offenders to remain in the community rather than being transferred to off- reservation detention facilities. Limited Management Information Systems The lack of complete and consistent data management and collection systems makes it difficult to establish a universe of reported gang-related crimes and victimization in Indian country. ~qaat is known is based on information tha( is collected in a fr~mented fashion and pieced together to foma an tu.lderstanding of the rates of gang-related crmae, violence mad victinfization in Indian communities. Tribes have little or no information concerning whether victuns are being served, if offender mobility and compliance is being monitored, or whether offenders are being tracked. 'A t related problem is the absence of clear and tmifonn criteria, across tribal conmmnities, that define oano~ and gang-related crinaes. Without clear def'mitions, accurate statistics cammt be collected to detemfine the prevalence of gangs, the magnitude of gang-related crimes. and the types of crime being conn'nitted against citizens.. SOLUTIONS FOR CHANGE Tribes, states, the federal government and citizens must take the following steps to address the various facets of oano violence in Indian communities. Victims hnprove victim services. At the tribal level, victim sen'ices should include assistance from the immediate crisis through the investigation, prosecution, and sentencing processes: provision of immediate shelter and continuing protection: and, crime victim compensation. Case ITacking mechanisnts should be developed. There needs to be an increase in the victim/witness advocacy staff and in probation officers at the tribal ,and Federal level, in order to ensure that victims are fully informed mad that their rights are upheld. Hold public forunts to infoma conununity members of victim assistance services and to educate citizens on how to avoid being victimized. Vicmn advocates and tribes should draw on cultural traditiolts (e.g., ceremonies, rituals, remedies, etc.) to I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I i I ! I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I help victims regain their physical. emotional, mental and spiritual well- being. Community Mobilization Conmmnity awareness programs should educate citizens about their rights, what to do if they are victimized, and resources and services that are available through tribal, state. federal, and non-governmental agencies, both immediatdy after the came and throughout case proceedings. The Depat'mlent of Justice and other related governmental entities should suppoll conmatmity awareness and skill-building through workshops, seminars, and public meetings to teach conmlunities how to generate conm~tmi~' action plans and implement strategies to combat violent crime. Tribal justice institutions should collaboratively sponsor multi- disciplinary task forces and community boards on crime and VlCtlmlzallon. Tribes should develop programs that hwolve whole fanfilies--youth, their parents and their extended family. Tribes should use various media such as electronic bulletin boards, community newsletters, and local TV and radio stations to positively influence Indian children and youth. Youth Development Build linkages between youth, parents, the community and the education system by develophlg school-based, early intervention programs that address truancy, altercations, substance abuse, and conflict resolution. Invoh'e youth in commtmity or tribal government plamfing groups and task forces that have organized to address zanos~, .,anoo o crime, and victim issues. Develop conmmnity-based programs such as UNFIT chapters and Boy, s and Girls Clubs of America. Build competency through programs in job training and employment skills for youth and young adultg. These programs channel energy into positive activities and help young people to develop skills and abilities that can be used in the future. Tribal Governments Newly elected o1\" ,appointed tribal officials should receive training in public affairs, public adnfinistration. and legislative and policy development at the tribal, state anti federal levels. Tribal govenunent officials must lead by exmnple, not by exception. Tribes should develop standards to guide the achninistmtiou of tribal govenunents. Tribal legislatures shotdd enact victim rights legislation that articulates sp.ecific protections for victhns of came. Tribal leaders must demoxtstrate conuuitment and concern for victim fights and needs and must model zero tolerance for violence in their own lives and commmfifies. Law enforcement departments need a process for publicly addressing issues of ethnic and racial discrimination. Law enforcement and judicial practitioners should lead efforts to improve collection and analysis of data about Indian crime, violence, and victhnization. Offenders Federal and state funding agencies should support victim-offender mediation and conflict resolution I forums that are based on tribal concepts of law and justice. Federal and state funding agencies need to support tribes in developing a full range of community-based alternatives to deal with offenders. These alternatives should encompass intervention, should be available at all stages of the tribal justice process, and should include a system of graduated sanctions such as boot caml?s \" , electronic monitoring, commttmty service for restitution, and day treatment. Tribes need support from county, state, and federal governments to access secure detention and correctional facilities for the confinement of violent offenders. The possibility of building facilities that can be shared among tribes should be explored. Without available facilities, certain and immediate punishment for violent criminals is impossible. Increase aftercare programs to integrate offenders back into the community, to assist the offender and tribal commtmity through the transition, and to minimize recidivism. Service providers based in tribal communities (such as tribal probation officers, where they exist) should participate in transition plans for offenders who are confined in off- reservation correctional facilities or treatment programs. Tribal Resources and Funding Opportunities State, federal, and non-govemmental agencies need to enhance financial resources for inpatient and outpatient treatment, confinement, and shelter care or safe havens for victims. Tribes need an adequate level of funding support for infrastructure development and .program operations, to enhance semces, to plan mid develop innovative pro teams, and to address emerging or rapidly growing crime problems. It is essential that tribes obtain flexible, non-conapetitive, direct funding from federal sources. Fedend and state funding agencies should apply their regulations flexibly so that tribes can tailor funded programs to their unique needs, t Tribes should receive funding to develop vohmteer programs, and to train conunu~.'b., members m crisis response, viclma advocacy, mad support services. A victim/witness coordinator should be stationed in each of the 12 Indian Health Service areas throu?.3aout the country. Intergovernmental Communication Relations and Develop model inte~ovemmental a~eements for the v,-wious entities that provide investigation, prosecution, law enforcement, medical, and social services to the tribes. Memoranda of Understanding or A~eement should specify the role of each level of government in processing federal and state offenses and m providing services for victims. Tribes should examhle as potential models the govenmaent-funded strategies other conununities have used to combat om~o violence, and should pursue the sanle sources of funding. Develop coordinated systems for service delivery and referral. Enhance intergovemmental relationships through interdisciplinary training for service providers at the tribal, state and federal levels. Non- governmental agencies should also be invited to attend. The training itself should clarify roles and focus on ensuring continuity of service. I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I Establish a consistem process for communicating to victims and their families and the tribal community. Tribal leaderslfip should establish similar processes for conununicating with state and federal agencies. Conduct monthly or quarterly face-to- face meetings among tribal, state, and federal service providers to share information on cases, conduct case nmnagement, address needs and problems, and discuss grant or funding opportunities. Increase the number of statewide, regional and national meetings for tribal, federal and state representatives to share promising approaches and to discuss crime and victimization in Native American communities. Improve the dissemination of information about federal and state funding available to tribes and explore venues such as the intemet, Native ,aanerican publications, and the media. Cultural Diversity and Sensitivity Training State and program professionals and paraprofessionals need to be culturally sensitive. Furthermore, they should provide services that are tailored to the victim's level of cultttral competence or proficiency. Training for service providers should address tribal lan~mmges, beliefs, practices, tribal conflict resolution approaches, tribal sanctions, socio-economics, and other fundamental elements of Native American culture and life. Tribes must take the lead in defining what is culturally appropriate for their peoples. State and federal agencies must respect and support tribal determinations about the appropriateness of treatment and services, including policies, procedures, and protocols for service delivery. State and federal agencies must also recognize the validity of decisions made by both modem and traditional tribal courts. Data collection and analysis of tribal programs must be culturally sensitive. Data collection instruments should be designed to collect culturally relevant information in a respectful and unintrusiv e manner. Role of the Office for Victims of Crime and Other Federal Agencies In recent years, the U.S. Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) has provided grmlt support and technical assistance in the areas of child maltreatment and victimization, and on building the tribal infrastructure necessary to address it, including the development of policies, codes, and legislation. The stone grant support and technical assistance is needed to address issues of ~an~o o violence, and in particular, to ensure safe~,, security mid protection for victims. Ftmding should be provided directly to the tribes whenever the 3, can meet a particular need ~4thin the community. Office of Justice Progranas (OJ'P) bureaus and offices should pool funding resources that support initiatives in Indian country. Other federal agencies that should be tapped for funding for training and technical assistance for the tribes are the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of the Interior, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Labor. The Deparanent of Justice and related state entities should set aside funding for programs that serve Indian victims who live in off-reservation communities. OVC should develop re~dations and guidelines for states that will ensure equitable Victims of Crime Act funds for tribes. OVC should survey states as to their guidelines for determining victim eligibility for compensation funds. Property crimes terrorize individuals and erode a communiW's sense of security. Crime victims compensation should be available for victims of property, crimes. OVC should support the expansion of the OJP American Indian and Alaska Native Desk, which has helped to reduce the infinfidalion tribes experience when requesting funds. Expansion of the position could be useful in coordinating federal funding to tribes. OJP should streamline the grant process and comolidate monitoring of grants to tribes, so that each tribe has only one or two rather than several grant monitors. OVC and other OJP bureaus and offices must seek tribal input on their vicdm programs and policies through focus group meetings and other re~onal and national gatherings of tribal, state and federal representatives. CONCLUSION Indian people today are equipped with an increasing awareness and understanding of the historical and social aspects of crime and victimization in their communities. Althou#a their culture and languages differ, the various Indian nations share a history of survival and traditions that honor communal harmony and well-being. These commonalties are unique strengths that Native Americans ~411 surely draw upon as they face the challenges of eradicating gang violence, restoring wholeness to victims, and working to strengthen tribal communities. 1N L I I I I I I I I I I I I I i II II i i i ' '%- ~' > N ' AMERICA INDIAN >\" - . ./ DEVELOPMEN\" ASSOCIAT'Es ' .( rT ..~,,ce ! 989, the American \"\" \u00a2'\" .9, De Iopm it ' ,dia,, ve e; m \" ~ A.oc~at.s (AIDAt has been an. impo,tant reSource for India,, ' t,.ibes.

The arrest shall be made even though the assault did no~ take place in the presence of an officer. NOTE: Probable cause is defined as follows: Based on the officer's observations and statements made by the parties involved and witness (if any) the officer using reasonable Judgement believes an assault did occur and the person to be arrested committed the assault. This mandatory arrest provision means that the victim \"need not sign a complaint for an arrest to occur. Further, under the provisions stated above, an officer shall arrest under probable cause even though it may be against the expressed wishes of ~he victim. REPOTTING Whenever an officer investigates an allegation of an incldeng as described in the above paragraphs, whether or notan arrest is made, the officer shall make a written report of the alleged Incldenc and submit that report to hi6/her Supervising Officer. The Supervising Officer will forward eoples of reports of elderly abuse to the Elderly Protection Team and/ or to the Adult Service Worker in the Department of Social Services within 48 working hours. (b) Order Pot Protection There will exist an action known\" as a petition for an order of protection I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I in cases o\u00a3 elderly abuse. (I) A petition for relief under this section may be made, by any family or household member on behalf of himself or herself or on behalf of other household or family member. (2) A petition for relief shall allege the existence of elderly abuse. (3) A petition for relief may be made regardless of whether or not there is a pending lawsuit, complaint, petition or other action between the parties.

Such order for protection shall include restraining the ab~sing party from committing acts of elderly abuse and/or exclude the abusing party from the residence of the elderly person, and protection from retaliation. Within ten (I0) days of servie of such an order, a hearing shall be held, at which time the court shall either dissolve an ex parte order wh/ch has been issued, or shall extend the order for pTotection for a definite period of time not to exceed one (I) year. If the court, after the hearing, issues or extends an order for : protection, the petitioner's court costs and attorney's fees shall be assessed against the (alleged) abuser. (c) Abuse Offender Assessment/Treatment Any indlvldual found guilty of Elderly Abuse, will be referred to the Elderly Protection Team for a mandatory assessment. The assessment will be completed by the following Elderly Protection Team members; a Substance Abuse Counselor, Domestic Violence Counselor, Mental Health Counselor, Adult Servlces/Aglng Social Worker and Elders. Presence of the investigating police officer may also be requested at the assessment. The referral for assessment will be by Order of the Court. The assessment will be initiated within two (2) working days of receipt of referral from Tribal Court. A person assessed may be referred to the offender treatment program for mandatory participation. The treatment program will consist of a minimum of seven (7) sessions and may result in additional referrals to other agencies for specific treatment. The purpose of the assessment/treatment program is to assess treatability and prevent reoccurrences of Elderly Abuse, providing services to perpetrator and victim. Any individual who fails to comply with assessment and treatment will be considered in contempt of court and will be subject to further penalties of the court. The order for assessment may also include, at the request of the Elderly ~Prbtection Team, an authorization for release of information relevant to the assessment process, to facilitate accurate assessmentd\" (d) Limlted~mber Of Court Ordered Subscance AbuseTreacment There w~11 be a llmlt of two (2) court ordered referrals for substance abuse treatment and aftercare program~rithin a three year period for any Indlvidual found guilty of elderly abuse (84-13) pending results and reco---endatlons of Elderly Protection Team assessment (see section I JUL-30-1999 16:03 S.D. DEPT. S.S. MISSION 605 856 2031 P.06/15 assessment). This does not prevent voluntary participation in a substance abuse treatment program. Any voluntary particlpatio~ ~in a substance abuse treatment program by the perpetrator does not count towards the limit of two referrals. Any individual who does not cooperate with or who fails to complete substance abuse treatment as ordered is considered in contempt of the court and is subject to arrest. Any suspension of the original sentence pending completion of the substance abuse treatment ordered shall be revoked and evidence of non-cooperation shall be presented to the court. If probable cause of non-cooperaton is established a bench warrant ~iI be issued and a hearing held within ~hree (3) working days. NOTE: The intent is to prevent the court system from enabling the perpetrator, by offering the opportunity ~o deal with the problem as presented. However, this does not preclude the perpetrators responsibility and liability. If the offense of Elderly Abuse precipitating the order for treatment involved an assaul~ or threat of assaul~, the person shall be held in custody until placement in an alcohol treatmen~ program-is effected. (e) Handatory SentenclngForRepeat 0ffenders Any person convicted of a second:offense o\u00a3 elderly abuse shall be sentenced to not less than half of the maximum sentence for class A crime, pending results and recommendations of the Elderly Protection Team (see section on assessment).

Our Grandparents would tell stories. Elders would talk about the importance of respect; how to speak and act not only in public, but amongst ourselves; how to treat each other. They would always treat us with a warm heart and kindness. Elders made sure we had a warm house, and food to eat, and clothes to wear. Elders would make sure we had a home that we could be proud to bring our friends back to. When we cried, they would comfort us and make us happy. When we were hungry, they made sure we had something to eat. They always treated us with respect and spoke to us in a respectful loving caring way. Elders would teach respect by example. respect ourselves. not always be taking. In the evenings, some were lucky, and had a radio, that would be hooked up to a storage battery and we would listen to the radio for maybe a \u00bd hour. Otherwise we would visit and talk, and tell stories. The stories were lessons; that was real education. The lessons were about how to live, and why respect is important and what can happen if that gets lost. We also learned to give and J I.- 4.0 This is what Elders worry about today. They see this respect falling to other things.

Public Law 280 was a transfer of legal power (jurisdiction) from the federal government to state governments which significantl .v changed the division of legal authority among tribal, federal, and state governments. Congress gave six states (five states initially - California, Minnesota, Nebraska. Oregon. and Wisconsin; and then Alaska upon statehood) extensive criminal and civil jurisdiction over tribal lands within the affected states (the so-called \"mandatory states\"). Pubiic Law 280 also permitted the other states to acquire jurisdiction at their option. Public Law 280 has generally brought about (1) an increased role for state crimina justice systems in \"Indian country\"(a term which is specifically defined in federal statutes j), (2) a virtual elimination of the special federal criminal justice role (and a consequent diminishment of the special relationship between Indian Nations and the federal government), (3) numerous real and perceived obstacles to individual Nations in tlleir development of tribal criminal justice systems, and (4) an increased and confusing state role in civil related matters. Consequently, Public Law 280 presents a series of important issues and concerns for Indian country crime victims and for those involved in a:;sisting these crime victims. Public Law 280, however, is a complicated statute which has been very controversial since the time of its enactment in 1953. It has often been misunderstood and misal~plied by both federal and state governments. Moreover, the practical impact of Public Law 280 has gone way beyond that which was legally required, intended, and contemplated * Jerry Gardner is the Executive Director of the Tribal Law and Polio. Institute, the Administra:m'for the National American Indian Court Judges Association, and an Adjunct Lecturer at the University o] California, Berkeley, School of La~' (Boalt Hall). Ada Pecos Melton is the President of Americtm Indian Development Associates and Administrator for the National Association of Tribal Court Persom~e,'. ' I 8 U.S.C. I 151 defines \"Indian Country\" as \"(a) all Indian lands within the limits of any Indian reservation under thejurisdiction of'the United States Government, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and, including rights -of-way running through the reservation, (b) all dependent Indian communities within the borders of'the United States whether within the original or subsequently acquired territo=y thereof, and whether within or without the limits of'a state, and (c) all Indian allotments, the Indiar tilles to which have not been extinguished, including rights-of-way running through the same.\" 1. W/tat is Public Law 280? Public Law 83-280, the 280 th Public Law enacted by the 83 ,d Congress in 19532. xvas a substantial transfer of jurisdiction from the federal government to the states in Indian country. This transfer of jurisdiction was required (or mandatory) for the states specifically mentioned in the Act and Public Law 280 also permitted other states t~ acquire jurisdiction. Indian Nations, on the other hand, had no choice in the matter. The Indian Nations which were affected by Public Law 280 had to deal with greatly itat:r~ased state power and state control over a broad range of reservation activities without any tribal consent. Before Public Law 280 was enacted, the federal government and Indian tribal courts shared jurisdiction over almost all civil and criminal matters 3 involving Indians in Indian country. The states had no jurisdiction. With the enactment of Public Law 280, affected states received criminal jurisdiction over reservation Indians. Furthermore, Public Law 280 opened state courts to civil litigation that previously had been possible only in tribal or federal courts. In the affected states, the federal government gave up control over crimes in Indian country (those involving Indian perpetrators and/or victims). Indian Nations lost control over many criminal and civil matters within their respective territories due to the policies of the federal and state governments. 2. Why was Public Law 280 Enacted? Practically every analysis of Public Lag, 280 begins with a reference to the pendtdum of federal policy swing between (1) Indian self-determination with an emphasis upon respecting tribal sovereignty and tribal self-government and (2) Indian \"termination\" with an emphasis upon \"terminating\" Indian Nations in order to assimilate their members into the dominant society. Public Law 280 was enacted in the 1950's - a period of termination and assimilation in Indian country - and it must be examined and understood within the context of the time period in which it was enacted. Public Law 280 ga.,; enacted in 1953 at the height of the post-World War II assimilationist period which included (1) the adoption in 1953 of House Concurrent Resolution 108 which estaglished tribal termination as the official federal policy and singled out specific Indian Nati.gns for termination, and (2) the implementation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs \"relocation\" program to encourage Indians to leave the reservations and seek employment in various metropolitan centers 4 2 Act of August 15, ! 953, ch. 505, 67 Stat. 588-590 (now codified as 18 U.S.C. I 162, 28 U.S.C. 1360 and other scattered sections in 18 and 28 U.S.C.). {j . ~, 3 Criminal matters are generally illegal (or criminal) acts which involve a violation of the ~,overnme nt s criminal laws whereas civil matters are generally actions between private parties brought to entbrce a right or gain payment for a wrong. 4 These termination and relocation policies were implemented by Bureau of Indian Affairs Commissioner Dillon S. Myer who had overseenthe internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. 2 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I The federal courts have generally held that Congress may \"authorize\" states to exercise jurisdiction in Indian country. Public Law 280, however, differed from earlier grants of jurisdiction to the states in that it allowed every state to assume jurisdiction at their own \u00b0 option at any time in the future. Most previous grants of jurisdiction to the states\" had been limited to some or all the reservations in a single state. They also had generally followed consultation with the individual state and the affected Indian Nations. L Public Law 280 itself began as an attempt to confer jurisdiction only on the state o f California. Its scope, however, was substantially broadened in the course of the process which lead to its adoption by Congress. The Senate Report of the bill 6 indicates that alleged lawlessness on the reservations and the accompanying threat to state citizens living nearby was the foremost concern of Congress when they passed Public Law 280 in the 1953. Instead of enhancing tribal criminal justice systems, Congress chose to adopt a policy which had the effect of radically shifting the balance of jurisdictional power towards the states and away from the federal government and Indian Nations. 3. Why is Public Law 280 Controversial? From the beginning, Public Law 280 was unsatisfactory to both states and Indian Nations. Public Law 280 inspired widespread criticism and concern from Indians and non-lndians alike. Disagreements arose immediately concerning the scope of powers given to tile states and the methods of assuming that power. Indian Opposition Indian opposition to Public Law 280 has focused upon the one-sided process which imposed state jurisdiction on Indian Nations and the complete failure to recognize tribal sovereignty and tribal self-determination. Public Law 280 required neither the cot.sent of the Indian Nations being affected nor even consultation with these Indian Nations. When he signed it into law. even President Eisenhower expressed misgivings about the lack of tribal consent and urged immediate amendment of the law to require tribal referenda - no such amendment passed Congress until 1968. s Act of June 8, 1940, ch. 276, 54 Stat. 249 (criminal jurisdiction to Kansas); Act of May 31. 1946. ch. 279, 60 Star. 229 (criminal jurisdiction to North Dakota over the Devils Lake Reservation): Act of June 30. 1948, ch. 759, 62 Stat. 1161 (criminal jurisdiction to Iowa over the Sac and Fox Reservation): Act of July 2, 1948, ch. 809, 62 Star. 1224 (criminal jurisdiction to New York) (codified at 25 U.S.C. sec. 232 [1970]): Act of Oct. 5, 1949, ch. 604, 63 Stat. 705 (civil and criminal jurisdiction to California over Agua Caliente Reservation); Act of Sept. 13, 1950, ch. 947, 64 Stat. 845 (civil jurisdiction to New York); (This li:~t does not include the earliest jurisdictional grants to the states, especially the jurisdiction assumed early this century by the State of Oklahoma - It is important to note that Oklahoma Indian Nations were no', directly impacted by Public Law 280 and Oklahoma did not take anY affirmative legislative action under Pt.blic Law 280.) 6 S.REP.No.699, 83d Cong., I s~ sess.5 (1953). State Dissatisfaction State dissatisfaction has focused upon the failure of the Act to provide federal funding Ibr states assuming authority under Public Law 280. The states were handed jurisdiction, but denied the funds necessary to finance it (in today's language - an \"unfunded mandate\"). Furthermore, Public Law 280 has been criticiied as a source of lawlessness rather than as a remedy. Professor Carole Goldberg, the preeminent legal authority on Public l.aw 280. has made a compelling case that Public Law 280 is a law which was allegedly de.sidled to cure the problem of\"lawlessness\" on reservations, but which has actually worsened the problem of lawlessness. As Professor Goldberg has statedT: ... Public Law 280 has itself become the source of lawlessness on reservations. Two different and distinct varieties of lawlessness are discernible. First, jurisdictional vacuums or gaps have been created, often precipitating the u.,:e of self-help remedies that border on or erupt into violence. Sometimes these ~,aps exist because no government has authority. Sometimes they arise because the government(s) that may have authority in theory have no institutional SUF,p,)rt or incentive for the exercise of that authority. I will call this kind of lawlessn,:ss the \"Idgal vacuum\" type. Second, where state law enforcement does inter~,ene, gross abuses of authority are not uncommon. In other words, power is uncabined by the law that it is supposed to constrain it. I will call this kind of lawlessness the \"abuse of authority\" type. 4. How has Public Law 280 been Amended since it Became Law in 1953? Congress amended Public Law 280 in 19688 - fifteen years after it was originally enacted. These 1968 amendments added a tribal consent requirement and authorized states to give back (or retrocede)jurisdiction to the federal government. The tribal consent requirement, however, only applied to future transt~rs ofjurisdi :tion to the states under Public Law 280. It did not apply to transfers of jurisdiction which had already taken place prior to 1968. Not surprisingly, not a single Indian Nation has consented to state jurisdiction since these 1968 amendments were enacted. 9 7 Carole Goldberg-Ambrose, Planting Tail Feathers: Tribal Survival and Public Law 280 (UC L A American Indian Studies Center, 1997), p. 12. 8 These amendments were part of the 1968 Civil Rights Act. They are now codified at 25 U.S.C. scc. 1321- 26. 9 At least two Indian Nations have been forced to accede to Public Law 280 jurisdiction since 1968 through Congressional recognition legislation which provided that Public Law 280 would apply to their res,:rvation either\"notwithstanding the provisions\" of the 1968 amendments (Mashantucket Pequot Nation in Connecticut, Public Law 98-134) or \"as ifthey had consented\" to it (Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo in Texas, Public Law 100-89). 4 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I The 1968 amendments also included a section which enables any state which had previously assumed jurisdiction under Public Law 280 to offer the return (or retrocession) of all or any measure of its jurisdiction to the federal government by sending a rest~iution to the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary then has the discretion (or choice) to accept or reject the return of jurisdiction. Under this amendment, however. Indian Nations do not have a formal role in the retrocession process although Indian Nations have attempted to do so informally. The amendments did not contain any mechanism by which Indian Nations c9uld initiate return jurisdiction on their own or force this retrocession on a 0 unwilling state. 5. Which States are Affected by Public Law 280? [This section could be provided as Exhibit #1 or as a sidebar.] Mandatory States Public Law 280 conferred criminal and civil jurisdiction on six specifically listed states (the so-called mandatory states) as follows: Califomia Minnesota Nebraska Oregon Wisconsin Alaska I\u00b0 All Indian country All Indian countr); except the Red Lake Reservation All Indian country All Indian country, except the Warm Springs Reservation All Indian country All lndian country, except Metlakatla criminal jurisdiction The original exceptions of the Red Lake, Warm Springs, and Metlakatla Reservations were for Iladian Nations which not only successfully demonstrated that they had satisfactory law enforcement mechanisms in place, but successfully objected to being subjected to state jurisdiction. However, most Indian Nations which objected in !'753 were not successful in being excluded from the application of Public Law 280. A few mandatory states have successfully retumed (or retroceded)jurisdiction back to the federal government since the 1968 amendments, including the following: (1) Wisconsin retroceded jurisdiction over the Menominee Reservation in connection with the Menominee Restoration Act (Public Law 93-197). (2) Nebraska retroceded jurisdiction over the Winnebago and Omaha Reservations. (3) Oregon partially retroceded jurisdiction over the Umatilla Reservation. Optional States |0 There were only five mandatory states in the original version of Public Law 280. Alaska was added later by the Act of Aug. 8, 1958, Pub. L. 85-615, 72 Stat.545, in connection with its admission to the Union. Public Law 280 also authorized any non-mandatory state to assume civil and/or cr~ minal jurisdiction over Indian country within its borders. These non-mandatory states had the option of taking partial jurisdiction without tribal consent until after the 1968 amendments were enacted. In some instances, these transfers of jurisdiction under Public Law 280 have also been returned (retroceded) back to the federal government, overturned by the courts, or have never been implemented. The optional states fall into two categories - states with disclaimers in their state constitutions limiting state jurisdiction over Indian country and states without these state constitutional disclaimers. , For the optional states without disclaimers in their state constitutions, the procedure t'or accepting Public Law 280 was straightforward. The following states without disclaimers assumed Public Law 280 jurisdiction either in whole or in part over Indian countr3, within their states: [] Nevada - 1955 (Nevada Revised Statutes section 41.430). [] Florida - 1961 (Florida Statutes Annotated section 285.16). [] Idaho tl - 1963 (subject to tribal consent)(ldaho Code sections 67-5101/3). [] Iowa - 1967 (Iowa Code Annotated sections 1.12-. 14). There were eight optional states with disclaimers in their state constitutions limitirg state jurisdiction over Indian country within their state borders. Congress assumed that these states would have to remove (or repeal) these disclaimers by constitutional amendment before Public Law 280 jurisdiction could be validly transferred. Six of the eight states with disclaimers have enacted legislation claiming full or partial Public Law 280 jurisdiction. Yet five of the six states - Washington, Montana, Arizona, North Dal:ota, and Utah - have not amended their state constitutions and, consequently, their claims of jurisdiction are subject to legal challenges. The following states with disclaimers have assumed jurisdiction either in whole or in part over Indian country within their stales: I Washington 12 - 1957 and 1963 (Washington Revised Code section 37.12.010) I South Dakota - 1957 and 1961 (civil and criminal actions on highv, ays only) (South Dakota Compiled Laws Annotated sections l-1-l 7, 1-2-21 ). [] Montana - 1963 (Montana Revised Code Annotated section 83-802). [] North Dakota-1963 (subject to tribal consent)(North Dakota Cent. Code section 27-19-02). [] Arizona -1967 (air and water pollution)(Arizona Revised Statutes Annotated sections 36-1801, 36-1856). [] Utah - 1971 (Utah Code Annotated sections 63-36-9 to 63-36-21). \" Idaho and Washington asserted jurisdiction over compulsory school attendance, public assistance. domestic relations, mental illness, juvenile delinquency, adoption proceedings, dependent children, and operation of motor vehicles over public roads. i., Idaho and Washington asserted jurisdiction over compulsory school anendance, public assista,cc. domestic relations, mental illness, juvenile delinquency, adoption proceedings, dependent children, and operation of motor vehicles over public roads.

The impact of Public Law 280 is most straightforward with regard to criminal actions. It is important, however, to examine separately the legal impact and the practical impact of Public Law 280. Legal Impact The main'legal impact of Public Law 280 concerning criminal jurisdiction is tha~. i~ (I) extended state criminal jurisdiction and the application of state criminal laws onto Indian reservations within the affected states and (2) eliminated special federal criminal jurisdiction over reservation areas in the affected states. In essence, the criminal jurisdiction sections of Public Law 280 shifted the special federal criminal jurisdiction over reservation areas to the state. The grant of criminal jurisdiction to the state,'; ~vas broader (\"to the same extent that such State has jurisdiction over offenses committed elsewhere within the State\") than the limited federal criminal jurisdiction which existed prior to Public Law 280 and, consequently, it expanded the realm of non-Indian control over reservation activities. Exhibit #2 sets out the differences in criminal jurisdiction between states with Public Law 280 and states without Public Law 280. Practical Impact The practical impact of Public Law 280 has generally been much greater than tht: Act itself legally required. Public Law 280 did not eliminate tribal criminal jurisdictio:~ - in fact, it did not make specific reference to tribal jurisdiction at all. Consequently. most courts and attorneys general have found that Indian Nations retain their inherent sovereign authority with regard to criminal jurisdiction. Thus, although states were delegated broad criminal jurisdiction, that jurisdiction remained concurrent (running together) with the inherent tribal criminal jurisdiction. The federal government, however, viewed Public Law 280 as a license to drop financial and technical support for tribal self-government and tribal governmental institutions in the Public Law 280 states. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) used it as an excuse for redirecting federal support on a wholesale basis away from Indian Nations in the \"Public Law 280 states\" and towards all other Indian Nations. The most striking illustration of this redirected federal support concerns the funding of tribal law enforcement and tribal courts. In many Public Law 280 states, the BIA refused to support tribal law entbrcement and tribal courts on the grounds that Public Law 280 made tribal criminal jurisdiction unnecessary, t3 As a result of the decision to drop federal support for tribal law enforcement and tribal court systems in Public Law 280 states, many Indian Nations in Public Law 280 states still do not have functioning criminal justice systems. The situation has been changing in recent years. An increasing number of Indian Nations in Public Law 280 states arc developing criminal justice systems. In some instances, Indian Nations are creating law 13 Carole Goldberg-Ambrose, Planting Tail Feathers.\" Tribal Sur~,ival and Public Law 280 (UCLA American Indian Studies Center, 1997), pp. 8-12. enforcement and court systems in connection with a formal Public Law 280 retrocession process. In most instances, however, Indian Nations are simply asserting their concurrent criminal jurisdiction.

What is the Effect of Public Law 280 in Civil Actions? The civil jurisdiction impact of Public Law 280 is less straightforward than the criminal jurisdiction impact. In general, it authorized the application of general state adjudicatory j uri sdiction (jurisdiction of courts to judge or adjudicate cases) to reservations in th e affected statbs, but it did not authorize state civil regulatory jurisdiction (jurisdiction of govemment administrative agencies to regulate conduct - see following section). Since federal courts were not authorized to hear many civil actions, Public Law 280 did not transfer federal civil jurisdiction. Instead, it authorized the state to intervene in civil matters (and individuals to file actions in state courts) which had previously been tinder exclusive tribal jurisdiction and, consequently, greatly expanded the realm of non-Indian control over reservation activities. Exhibit #3 sets out the differences in civil jurisdiction between states with Public Law 280 and states without Public Law 280. 8 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I i I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I The practical impact of Public Law 280 with regard to civil jurisdiction was much more substantial than legally required by the Act itself. Public Law 280 did not eliminate tribal civil jurisdiction. However, as a result of the decision to drop federal support Ibr tribal governmental institutions, many Indian Nations in Public Law 280 states were unable to operate court systems. In recent years, an increasing number of these Indian Nations are again developing court systems. It is importafit to note that many of these developing tribal courts are initially asserting civil jurisdiction, especially over Indian Child Welfare and child protection matters. The development of criminal justice systems is often delayed due to the high cost of law enforcement and detention facilities required for~a fully functional tribal criminal justice system. [This exhibit could be placed here or in a shaded box.] Exhibit #3: Civil Jurisdiction on Indian Reservations (Indian Country) States without PL 280 States with PL 280 Tribal Over Indians and non-Indians with limitations Over Indians and non-indians with limitations Federal Same as Off-Reservation (diversity of citizenship, federal question, etc.) Same as Off-Reservation (diversity of citizenship. federal question, etc.) State None, except some suits with non-Indians or on fee lands Over suits involving Indians or non-Indians generally. with exceptions found in PL 280 & What are tile Limitations on Public Law 280? There are a number of important limitations on the application of Public Law 280, including the following: (a) Trust Status: Public Law 280 specifically provided that it did not affect tile trust status of Indian lands. It also did not terminate the trust relationship, end tribal sovereign immunity, or exclude Indians in affected states from receiving benefits under federal Indian programs. (b) Limits to State Authority: States may not apply laws related to such matters as environmental control, land use, gambling, and licenses if those laws are part c, fa general state regulatory scheme. Public Law 280 gave states only law enforcement and civil judicial authority - not regulatory power. It also denied states power to legislate conceming certain matters, particularly property held in trust by the United States and reserved hunting and fishing rights. The state generally cannot tax on Indian reservations. The U. S. Supreme Court 14 has interpreted Public Law 280 as a law designed only to open state courts to civil and criminal actions involvin G reservation Indians and not to subject resei'vations to the full range of state regulation. Finally, there are some matters considered so central to the very definition of the Indian Nations - such as enrollment and certain domestic matters - that state \u00a2otl rts may be excluded from hearing such matters. (c) Municipal and CounO, Laws: Public Law 280 may have established that only statewide laws are applicable to reservation Indians - excluding municipal and count), laws. Courts have generally excluded the application of local laws since Public l,aw 280 was not intended to deny Indian Nations their basic governmental functior~s. (d) Later Federal Laws: Some federal laws enacted after the 1953 enactment of Pttblic Law 280 have reduced the amount of jurisdiction available to the states and simultaneously increased tribal sovereignty and/or federal power. For example, the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act (Public Law 95-608) gave Indian Nations exclusive jurisdiction over certain child custrdy proceedings involving Indian children, and the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (Public Law 100-487) makes enforcement of state gaming laws a federal rather than a state responsibility. 9. How Does Public Law 280 Affect Indian Country Crime Victims? There are many ways in which Public Law 280 may affect crime victims in Indian country, including the following: (a) Federal Role Eliminated.\" In states without Public Law 280, the federal criminal justice system has a special role in Indian Country - crimes are often investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Indian Affairs; m~or crimes and interracial (Indian v. non-Indian) crimes are prosecuted through the United States Attorney's offices; the federal victim witness coordinator is actively involved in these federal cases; etc. In states with Public Law 280, this special federal role is eliminated. (b) Greatly Expanded Role of State Criminal Justice System: In states without Public Law 280, the role of the state criminal justice system in Indian country is generally limited to non-Indian v. non-Indian crimes only. In states with Public Law 28(I, the role of the state criminal justice system in Indian country is essentially the same as outside Indian country. The prior federal role has been transferred to the state, but the grant of criminal jurisdiction to the states is even greater than the prior federal role. ,4 Bryan v. Itasca CounO,, 426 U.S. 373 (1976). I0 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) Consequently, Public Law 280 significantly expanded the realm of non-lndian control over reservation activities. Limited Tribal Criminal Justice Systems in Public Law 280 States: As a result of the limited federal support for tribal law enforcement and tribal court systems in Public Law 280 states, many Indian Nations in Public Law 280 states still do not have functioning criminal justice systems. There may not be any tribal law enforcernent or tribal court system. If a tribal court does exist, it may only exercise jurisdiction over civil actions, lfa tribal criminal justice 'system does exist, it may be informal ~nd/or have only very limited resources available. Possible Choice of Criminal Justice System: Due to the concurrent jurisdiction of the tribal and state criminal justice systems under Public Law 280, it is possible that a victim of crime may face a choice of criminal justice systems (assuming that there is a functioning tribal criminal justice system) or the possibility of two prosecutions by the separate sovereigns (state and tribal). Lawlessness of the \"Legal Vacuum\" Type: Public Law 280 has often created what Professor Goldberg identified as lawlessness of the \"legal vacuum\" type. The jurisdictional vacuums or gaps caused by Public Law 280 have often precipitated the 'use of self-help remedies that border on or erupt into violence. These self-hell~. remedies have developed because (I) no government (either tribal or state) has authority, (2) the perception exists that no government has authority, and/or {3~ the government has authority in theory but no institutional support or incentive for the exercise of that authority. Lawlessness of the \"Abuse of Authority\" Type: Public Law 280 has often created what Professor Goldberg identified as lawlessness of the \"abuse of authority\" type. There have been many instances in which state law enforcement has intervened, but gross abuses of authority have occurred (power is unleashed by the law that is supposed to constrain it). Mistrust and Hostility between Tribal and State Officials/Communities: On many reservations, Public Law 280 has contributed to a continuing history of mistrust and hostility between tribal and state officials/communities. The controversy surrounding Public Law 280 has contributed to this situation, including the state dissatisfaction with the lack of federal funding and the tribal opposition to the broad unilateral imposition of state law. Furthermore, a common Indian perception in many Public Law 280 states is that state law enforcement claims that they have no authority whenever the Indian Nation asks them to intervene (\"legal vacuum\" lawlessness), but that state law enforcement claims that they have this authority whenever the Indian Nation does not want them to intervene (\"abuse of authority\" lawlessness). Obviously, this situation can present many problems for Indian country crime victims. 11 10. How Do I Determine the Impact of Public Law 280 on an Individual Reservation? There are a series of questions which need to be answered in order to determine the impact of Public Law 280 upon individual states and reservations, including the following: (a) Is the state one of the mandatory Public Law 280 states? The mandatory Public Law 280 states are California, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ore~gon. Wisconsin, and Alaska (see Exhibit #I). The mandatory states were provided with full transfer of jurisdiction under Public Law 280. (b) Is the state one of the optional Public Law 280 states and, if so, was it a partial or a full assumption ofjurisdiction ? There are .10 optional Public Law 280 states - Nevada, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Wa.,;hington, South Dakota, Montana, North Dakota, Arizona, and Utah (see Exhibit #1). Unlike the mandatory states, these optional states were able to assume Public Law 280 jurisdiction either in whole or in part. Consequently, it is important to determine the specific application of jurisdiction by the individual state. (In addition, there have been other federal laws granting state jurisdiction for individual reservations or states - see Ibotnotes 3 and 7). ( c) Has the state returned or retroceded Public Law 280jurisdiction or is it otherwise no longer in effect? A number of both the mandatory and optional states have retroceded (or returned) jurisdiction back to the federal government since the 1968 Public Law 280 amendments. In addition, some assertions of jurisdiction have been overturned by the courts or were never implemented. (d) Is the specific reservation affected? In many states, Public Law 280 has been applied to some reservations, but not to other reservations. Even if the state is listed as either a mandatory or an optional Public Law 280 state, it may not apply to all of the reservations within that state. 09 Is there a tribal court system? An increasing number of Indian Nations in Public Law 280 states have developed court systems, but the situation varies substantially from state to state and from tribe to tribe. Tribal courts now exist in most of the optional Public Law 280 states. The development of tribal court systems in the mandatory states has generally been more difficult, especially in Califomia and Alaska. The existence of a tribal court system greatly increases the available remedies and services for crime victims. (g) Does the tribal court assert both civil and criminal jurisdiction? Many of the tribal courts which are being developed in Public Law 280 states initially assert only civil jurisdiction due to the high cost of law enforcement and detention 12 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I i I I I I I I I I I facilities. The rights of a crime victim and the services available to that crime victim may be limited if the only tribal court option is a civil action (for example, a civil domestic violence action does not generally have as much impact as a criminal action since options such as mandatory arrest policies may not be available). ('h) Are there tribal law enforcement services imd facilities? Many Indian Nations in Public Law 280 states have limited law enforcement services and facilities. The rights of a crime victim may be limited if these services/facilities ~re non- existent, limited, or severely rationed due to budgetary limitations. (i) What is the relationship between the tribal criminal justice system and the state criminal justice system? The relationship between the tribal criminal justice system and the state criminal justice system can have a significant impact upon the rights of Indian country crime vicliras, but this relationship varies substantially from state to state. Some Public Law 280 slates have been willing to retrocede Public Law 280 jurisdiction. In some states, this relationship has been particularly difficult, especially in California and Alaska. In other states, the tribal and state justice systems have been able to establish very productive relationships. For example, tribal and state courts in Wisconsin have generally established good working relationships. In fact, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals held that once an Indian Nation has a domestic abuse ordinance in place and a tribal court to enforce it. then the tribal court has exclusive jurisdiction despite Public Law 280. ~5 ,5 St. Germain v.

A-I Contractors has potentially devastating impact for tribal court civil jurisdiction. If the broad lan- guage used in many parts of the decision is ap- plied, then the decision could have impact far be- yond the ~c facts and holding of the case. In fact, many federal and state courts have been ap- plying this broad language and expanding the im- pact of the decision well beyond the specific facts and holding of the case. It is critical, however, to .. .................. ............. :: ................... stress whenever therefore not binding in :~:ii:.:i:~:.~ial/eaa.::!:i:!;: subsequent cases.

This fact finding would then be used to distin- guish (that is, to point out an essential difference; to prove a case cited is inapplicable) the case at hand fi'om the Strate decision. Strate, et al. v. A-I Contractors, et al. 520 U.S. 438 (1997); Decided April 28, 1997. Addressing the jurisdiction of a tribal court over an action arising out of an automobile accident in- volving non-Indians on a state highway right-of- way on Indian lands, the Court holds that a tribe's adjudicative jurisdiction does not exceed its legisla- tive jurisdiction, finding that subject to controlling provisions in treaties and statutes, and the excep- tions outlined in Montana v. United States, 450 U.S. 544 (1981), the civil authority of Indian tribes and tribal courts does not extend to the actions of non-tribal members on non-Indian fee lands. The following are possible ways to distinguish the case at hand from Strafe. ]n order to distinguish (or point out differencexJ from Strate, the court will need to make specific factual findings con- cerning these is.rues. Parties: Both parties in Strate were non-Indian. If any party is Indian (or tribal member), then So'ate does not apply. (Note that the 9\" circuit in Wilson v. Marchington, 127 F.3d 805, does not agree). Nature of the Land: Strate only applies to non- Indian fee land - the Supreme Court held that the nature of the right of way in Strate rendered it equivalent to non-Indian fee land. If the land is trust land (or a tribal road rather than a state road) without similar right of way, then Strate does not apply. Rule of the Road: The Supreme Court in Strafe was simply setting out a straight line rule of the road. The Strate decision, therefore, only applies to high- way accident cases which takes place on state roads. If it was not a highway accident or it did not take place on a state road, then Strate does not apply. Montana Test: Ira greater case can be made for either of the Montana prongs, then Strate does not apply. For example: (1) under con.sensual relation- ships - in Strate, the Court found that the parties were \"strangers\" to the contract or the accident, but a greater case could be made if this was not the case; (2) under political integrity, economic secu- rity, and especially health or safety - a greater case could be made if, for example; any party is Indian (in the overruled Bremner dist.tict court opinion, the court held that \"injury to a single tribal member is sufficient to implicate the interests protected by the second Montana exception.\" - note that this deci- sion, 24 ILR 3213, although it has been overturned actually contained a very good example of a possible methodology for distinguishing Strafe), the non- Indian business is located on the reservation, the non-Indian is a reservation resident, etc. (Also note' that the Montana test should only be applied if non- Indian fee land is at issue.) Treaty or Statute: The Court in Strate frequently qualified its holding by stating that it was \"absent a statute or treaty authorizing the tribe to govern the conduct of non-members on the highway in ques- tion\". If there is a treaty (such as the Navajo Nation Treaty of 1868 with the \"bad men\" clause), then a good argument can be made that Strate does not apply. Black's Law Dictionary defines dicta as follows: Opinions of a judge which do not embody the reso- lution or determination of the court. Expressions in court's opinion which go beyond the facts before the court and therefore are individual views of au- thor of opinion and not binding in subsequent cases. i I1 I i:~!:.S~.!Z!!~i!!~!~!;i:.::i~;:.~i~:;:.:~i~iii~:~:;::~i:~:y::!~i.~.:~:~:~:~i:::.:.~::.!!i:::~!~.~:~.i:i:!:i~:i: i:.:?i:i;ii: :~i::~::i!i/ii:j.~!.: NMCJA Ne~-5 Judicial Update: Court lacks authority to adjudicate the ease; and enjoins the defendants from procex, ding further against the plaintiffs in Crow Tribal Court.

Tribal Courts Navajo Nation Means v. District Court This decision holds that Russell Means is subject to the criminal jurisdiction of the Navajo Na- tion. The Court based its ruling on three principals: (1) The \"set apart for the use and occupation\" and \"bad men\" language of the United States-Navajo Nation Treaty of 1868 recognizes crimi- nal jurisdiction over nonmember Indians by the Navajo Nation. (2) Russell Means gave his con- sent to criminal jurisdiction by \"assuming tribal relations\" with Navajos by becoming a hadane or \"in-law.\" (3) The assertion of criminal jurisdiction over a non- member Indian does not violate equal protection of the law, be- cause any person can become an in-law and there is a Navajo Na- tion governmental interest in maintaining peace and order.

Limiting the Potential Impact of Venetie The 1998 U.S. Supreme Court Venetie decision had devastating consequences for Alaska Natives, but it also presents substantial problems for Indian Na- tious in the lower 48 states since the Court adopted a very restrictive interpretation of the \"dependent Indian community\" prong in the \"Indian country\" definition. Specifically, the Court required that both a federal set-aside and a federal superintendence requirement must be satisfied for a finding of \"dependent Indian community\" rather than the broader tests which had previously been adopted by many circuits. Alaska v. Native Village of Venetie Tribal Gov- ernment, et aL 522 U.S. 520 (1998);Decided February 25, 1998. In an action challenging the authority of the Native Village of Venetie to impose taxes on the conduct of business activities on tribal lands, the U.S. Supreme Court holds the term \"dependent Indian communi- ties\" as employed in the 18 U.S.C. 1151 definition of\"Indian country\" refers to a limited category of Indian lands that are neither reservations or allot- ments and that satisfy two requirements: (1) the lands must have been set aside by the United States for the use of the Indians as Indian lands, and (2) the lands must be under federal superintendence; and concludes that the lands at issue do not constitute Indian country. The following axe two possible methods to address the problems presented by Venetie: First, convert tribal fee land(whether owned by tribe or individual) into trust status whenever possi- ble and as soon as possible. Second, tribal courts should conduct extensive fact t'mding when given the first opportunity to determine ff tribal jurisdiction is appropriate (that is when deter- mining if the land in question is \"Indian Country\" based upon its status as a =dependent Indian commu- nity\"). Specifically, tn'bal courts should make as many specific factual findings concerning both the federal set-aside and the federal superintendence require- ments. In making these factual findings, a tribal court might want to refer to the broader \"dependent Indian community\" tests which had previously been used by federal appellate courts. Although the Supreme Court has limited the \"dependent Indian community\" defini- tion to federal set-aside and federal superintendence, it may be possible over time to incorporate many of the other factors into these two requirements. io I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I !

Message from 1 The Director This bulletin presents basic information for improving the cooperation between Tribal and Federal agencies in handling child sexual abuse cases. It describes how close cooperation between Tribal and Federal law enforcement agencies will ensure effective investigation and prosecution of child abuse cases. The investigation and prosecution of child sexual abuse cases often present a jurisdictional maze. This confusion is the result of difficulty in determining jurisdiction combined with provisions for concurrent jurisdiction of certain cases for Tribal and Federal officials. Due to overlapping jurisdictional lines, law enforcement agencies and service providers often feel compelled to interview child victims multiple times thus producing unnecessary victim trauma. in response to overlapping jurisdictions, many American Indian tribes have developed multi-agency protocols and multidisciplinary teams, children's advocacy centers, and court appointed special advocate (CASA) programs to address jurisdictional concerns and to coordinate the investigation and prosecution of cases and to minimize trauma to child victims. The Federal government has undertaken a number of new initiatives to facilitate Tribal and Federal cooperation: hiring 26 Assistant U.S. Attorneys to work in districts with large Indian populations, establishing a Tribal Justice Office at the U.S. Department of Justice, and creating an American Indian and Alaskan Natives Office at the Justice Department's Office of Justice Programs. These offices are designed to monitor program support and provide technical assistance to the tribes. Kathryn M.

Page 2 of 10 I I I The multijurisdictional responsibilities for investigating incidents of child abuse in Indian Country can produce confusion among service providers and others who work with child sexual abuse victims in Indian Country. A crime committed in Indian Country can be subject to investigation by local law enforcement, consisting of Tribal and/or Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) police; State law enforcement, such as the county sheriff, city police, or State troopers; and/or Federal law enforcement personnel from the BIA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Further, once a case has been investigated, it may be subject to prosecution by one or more jurisdictions, including State, Federal, and/or Tribal courts. I I For victims and service providers alike, this overlapping of investigative and prosecutorial responsibilities can be frustrating. The lack of clear protocols among agencies that may have jurisdiction over crimes in Indian Country has also led to confusion among law enforcement and prosecutorial professionals over who is responsible for criminal investigation and prosecution. I Determining Criminal Jurisdiction I I I I I I I I I I I The determination of which agency has criminal jurisdiction (which includes investigative and prosecutorial responsibilities) over cases in Indian Country is influenced by several factors: where the crime occurred, the type of crime, the race of both the victim and the perpetrator, and statutes specifying Federal, State, and Tribal jurisdiction over certain cases. The law enforcement agency that receives the initial report of the crime may assume the responsibility for determining criminal investigative jurisdiction. Location One factor that affects the determination of criminal jurisdiction is the physical location where the alleged offense occurred. If an offense occurs within Indian Country (as defined by 18 U.S.C. Section 1151, see the text box below), it is subject to preliminary investigation by the police serving that land. However, in many instances both Tribal and BIA law enforcement agencies provide services to an Indian reservation. Tribal police may be the first to respond to a suspected crime, while BIA criminal investigators may perform the actual criminal investigation. Hence, it is critical that the investigative roles be clarified and understood by each agency as well as by the affected parties, (i.e., offender, victim, and the Tribal community). Some tribes have their own Tribal criminal investigators who perform the same duties as BIA criminal investigators. In addition, investigative responsibility for all serious Federal crimes rests with the FBI, regardless of where the crime occurred. Indian Country is defined in 18 U.S.C. Section 1151 as: (a) all land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States Government, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and, including rights-of-way running through the reservation, (b) all dependent Indian communities within the borders of the United States whether within the original or subsequently acquired territory thereof, and whether within or without the limits of a State, and (c) all Indian allotments, the Indian titles to which have not been extinguished, including rights-of-way running through the same. Type of Crime A second factor affecting the determination of criminal jurisdiction is the type of crime. The I http:liwww.ojp.usdoj.govlovclinforesltriballtribalbult.htm 9/15/99 Improving Tribal/Federal Prosecution of Child... Page 3 of 10 Major Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 1153, establishes Federal jurisdiction for 16 major criminal offenses (including child sexual abuse) if the crime was allegedly committed by an Indian defendant. Major Crime Act offenses in Indian Country may be subject to Federal and/or Tribal jurisdiction. The General Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. 1152, provides for Federal criminal jurisdiction over a broader range of possible criminal actions involving interracial crimes in Indian Country. Race A third factor influencing criminal jurisdiction involves the race of the alleged perpetrator and victim. Pursuant to case law, cases that involve a non-Indian perpetrator and a non-Indian victim are within State jurisdiction; in these cases, Tribal and Federal courts exercise no jurisdiction. However, if the perpetrator is Indian, Tribal agencies have jurisdiction. Depending on the type of crime, Federal agencies may also have jurisdiction, as defined by the Major Crimes Act. The race of the perpetrator is also a major factor in prosecution. As the U.S. Supreme Court noted in Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe, 435 U.S. 191 (1978), Tribal courts do not have cdminal jurisdiction over non-Indians (see the text box on page 3). Criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians rests solely with the Federal government. However, Tribal courts do have civil jurisdiction over non-Indians. There are a number of sanctions such as civil infractions, civil contempt for failure to comply with a court order, and exclusion that Tribal courts can apply to non-Indians through civil actions related to child sexual abuse allegations. 18 U.S.C. Section 1153. Offenses committed within Indian Country (a) Any Indian who commits against the person or property of another Indian or other person any of the following offenses, namely, murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, maiming, a felony under chapter 109A [aggravated sexual abuse (including with children), sexual abuse, sexual abuse of a minor or ward, and abusive sexual contact], incest, assault with intent to commit murder, assault with a dangerous weapon, assault resulting in serious bodily injury, an assault against an individual who has not attained the age of 16 years, arson, burglary, robbery, and a felony under section 661 of this title [theft of personal property] within the Indian Country, shall be subject to the same law and penalties as all other persons committing any of the above offenses, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. (b) Any offense referred to in subsection (a) of this section that is not defined and punished by Federal law in force within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States shall be defined and punished in accordance with the laws of the State in which such offense was committed as are in force at the time of such offense. 18 U.S.C. Section 1152. Laws governing Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the general laws of the United States as to the punishment of offenses committed in any place within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, except in the District of Columbia, shall extend to the Indian Country. This section shaft not extend to offenses committed by one Indian against the person or property of another Indian, nor to any Indian committing any offense in the Indian Country who has been punished by the local law of the tribe, or to any case where, by treaty stipulations, the exclusive jurisdiction over such offenses is or may be secured to the Indian tribes respectively.

Page 4 of 10 If an Indian child is abused but the incident takes place outside of Indian Country, the Ti'ibal court has no jurisdiction. The tribe does have an interest in the disposition of any civil custody actions involving a child who is an enrolled member of the tribe or is eligible for enrollment in the tribe through the Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C. Sections 1901-1963. Exhibit 1.

For example, Public Law 83-280 (P.L. 280) transfers Federal criminal jurisdiction in Indian Country to the State (see the text box on the next page). In P.L. 280 states, the tribe and the State have concurrent jurisdiction in both investigation and prosecution provided the tribe has the governmental resources to perform these duties. Just as there are multiple jurisdictions involved in the investigation of child sexual abuse cases, similar jurisdictional concerns exist regarding the prosecution of child sexual abuse cases. Tribal courts have concurrent criminal jurisdiction with Federal courts (and with certain States under P.L. 280) over child sexual abuse cases in Indian Country. Federal jurisdiction over child sexual abuse cases derives from the General Crimes Act or the Major Crimes Act. The Major Crimes Act provides for Federal jurisdiction over specified crimes occurring in Indian Country when the defendant is an Indian and the crime involved is either incest or any felony under Chapter 109 A, 18 U.S.C. Sections 2241-2245. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that charging a defendant in both Federal court and Tribal court does not amount to double jeopardy. In United States v. Wheeler, 435 U.S. 313 (1978), the Court held that if a person, subject to the jurisdiction of the tribe, is tried and convicted in Tribal court for an offense, that same person may be tried by the Federal government for a similar offense arising out of the same incident (see the text box on the next page). Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Indian Tribal courts do not have inherent criminal jurisdiction to try and to punish non-Indians, and hence may not assume such jurisdiction unless specifically authorized to do so by Congress. As the Court noted: Tribes [that] claim authority to try non-Indians [do so] not on the basis of congressional statute or treaty provision but by reasons of their retained national sovereignty. http:llwww.ojp.usdoj.govlovclinforesltriballtribalbult.htm 9/15/99 Improving Tribal/Federal Prosecution of Child... Page 5 of 10 Indian tribes do retain elements of \"quasi-sovereign\" authority after ceding their lands to the United States and announcing their dependence on the Federal Government. But the tribes' retained powers are not such that they are limited only by specific restrictions in treaties or congressional enactments. As the Court of Appeals recognized, Indian tribes are prohibited from exercising both those powers of autonomous States that are expressly terminated by Congress and those powers \"inconsistent with their status.\" The Court did note the increasing sophistication of Indian Tribal court systems, the safeguards for non-Indians included in the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968, and Tribal concerns about the prevalence of non-Indian crime on reservations. Nevertheless, the Court found that these considerations did not outweigh the longstanding principle .that Indian tribes do not have inherent jurisdiction to try and to punish non-Indians for criminal offenses. Public Law 280: A Federal grant of jurisdiction to the States In 1953, Congress adopted an approach, commonly known as Public Law 280 (67 Stat. 588) to change the division of jurisdiction among Federal, State, and Tribal governments. Congress initially gave five States, and later a sixth, extensive criminal and civil jurisdiction over Indian Country and permitted all other States to acquire jurisdiction at their option. In the States where P.L. 280 applies (Alaska, California, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oregon, and Washington), it radically shifts the balance of jurisdictional power toward the States and away from the Federal government and the tribes. It does not, however, confer total jurisdiction on the States, nor does # alter the trust status of Indian lands or terminate the trust relationship between the tribes and the Federal government. It also does not end the sovereign immunity of the tribes [see California v. Quechan Tribe of Indians, 595 F.2nd 1153 (9th Cir. 1979)]. From its inception P.L. 280 engendered criticism from both the States and the tribes. State governments resented the fact that they were given the duty of law enforcement without the means to pay for it; Congress neither appropriated funds for that purpose nor rendered Indian lands taxable by the States. The tribes, on the other hand, resented the fact that State jurisdiction was thrust on them without their consent, and they particularly objected to the provision that additional States could acquire jurisdiction without consulting the concerned tribes. These criticisms prompted Congress to draft a group of amendments to P.L. 280 that was passed as part of the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968. These amendments permitted States to retrocede jurisdiction over Indian Country to the Federal govemment, and also provided that no States in the future could assume this jurisdiction without Tribal consent. As a consequence, there has been almost no expansion of P.L. 280jurisdiction since 1968. In the number of States where it is still in effect, however, P.L. 280 presents jurisdictional questions of considerable complexity. The Wheeler decision allows a person to be criminally charged in both Federal and Tribal court for child sexual abuse. This gives both Tribal and Federal courts greater flexibility in handling child sexual abuse cases. Under the decision, a Tribal prosecutor is allowed to proceed with Tribal court action immediately after a case is reported instead of being required to wait until the Federal prosecutor decides whether to accept or decline the case. Since a decision on Federal prosecution frequently takes several months or more, it is often necessary for the Tribal prosecutor to take action more quickly to punish the perpetrator and send a clear message to the community that child sexual abuse will not be tolerated. However, investigation emanates from each court, and the victim is subjected to multiple interviews. Reaching Agreement From the initial receipt of a report of alleged child sexual abuse, complex jurisdictional considerations arise. Through formal or informal arrangements, Federal, State, Tribal, and http :llwww.ojp.usdoj.govlovclinforesltdballtribalbult.htm 9/15/99 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I Improving Tribal/Federal Prosecution of Child... Page 6 of 10 local police may have agreements clarifying agency roles for investigating certain types of cases in Tribal territory. Confusion regarding criminal jurisdiction can be minimized when such arrangements are described in written protocols that clearly confer responsibility for making initial jurisdictional decisions and outline the nature of the working relationships between the various Tribal, State, and Federal agencies. United States v. Wheeler I I I I The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that when an Indian tribe criminally punishes a tribe member for violating Tribal law, the tribe acts as an independent sovereign and not as an arm of the Federal government, and since Tribal and Federal prosecutions are brought by separate sovereigns, they are not \"for the same offense\" and the Double Jeopardy, Clause thus does not bar one when the other has occurred. The Court stated that: [O]ur cases recognize that the Indian tribes have not given up their full sovereignty. We have recently said, \"Indian tribes are unique aggregations possessing attributes of sovereignty over both their members and their territory....[They] are a good deal more than 'private, voluntary organizations .... '\" In sum, Indian tribes still possess those aspects of sovereignty not withdrawn by treaty or statute, or by implication as a necessary result of their dependent status. (See Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe.) I I I I I I I I I I I Coordinating Criminal Investigation and Prosecution Once criminal jurisdiction has been established, Tribal, State, and Federal coordination of criminal investigation and prosecution of child sexual abuse cases is imperative. The possibility for multiple interviews of child victims is obvious, given the number of jurisdictions and agencies that have a legitimate interest in child sexual abuse cases in Indian Country. It is conceivable, for example, that an incest case could be handled as follows: Tribal police receive an after-hours report of alleged child sexual abuse. A Tribal police officer responds to the crime scene and performs a preliminary investigation. The officer's initial investigation is reviewed by his or her superior and assigned to a BIA criminal investigator for further investigation. The case is also forwarded to the FBI. The BIA criminal investigator and Tribal child protective services worker jointly interview the child and prepare their reports. The criminal investigator's report goes forward through the criminal justice system, and the child protective service worker's report goes through the civil court system. In processing the criminal case, the FBI agent may feel that further investigation needs to be undertaken, including additional interviews of the victim performed by either the agent or the criminal investigator. The case is presented to both the Tribal prosecutor and the U.S. Attorney's Office. One or both of these prosecutors may feel that it is necessary to personally interview the child, perhaps to assess the child's ability to testify in court. The Federal prosecutor may request additional information prior to making a prosecutorial decision. By the end of this scenario, the child could have been interviewed by six separate individuals in six or more separate interviews. Each individual has a legitimate interest in the case and the need to obtain specific information. While tremendous progress has been made in coordinating interviews and reducing the number of persons interviewing child victims, the complexity of multiple jurisdictions in Indian Country poses special challenges to reducing the number of interviews a child endures. OVC has addressed the challenge of I http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/ovc/infores/tribal/tribalbult.htm 9115/99 Improving Tribal/Federal Prosecution of Child... Page 7 of 10 reducing trauma to child victims through the CJA Partnerships for Indian Communities. The goal of the CJA Partnership is to improve the investigation and prosecution of child abuse and child sexual abuse cases in Indian Country in a manner that limits additional trauma to the child victim. Multidisciplinary Teams The development of multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) in Indian Country is an important vehicle for coordinating the investigation, prosecution, and disposition of child sexual abuse cases. To be effective, MDTs must have the participation of all law enforcement, social services, medical, child welfare, victim assistance, and judicial agencies with jurisdiction over child sexual abuse cases. Tribal representation is necessary on existing county or regional MDTs, and State and Federal law enforcement officers and prosecutors must participate in Tribally based MDTs. Participation in such MDTs is mandated for Federal agencies under the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 and the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act (Public Law 101-630) (see the text box on the next page). MDTs offer an ideal opportunity to discuss prosecutorial action. Representatives from U.S. Attorneys' or district attorneys' offices meet with Tribal prosecutors and determine the best venue for initial criminal prosecution. Information on the status of various investigations should be available on a regular basis. Lack of access to information regarding the status of cases has long been a problem for Tribal police and prosecutors, and the MDT offers an appropriate forum to share information and plan strategies. U.S. Department of Justice Initiatives I I I I I I I I I In addition to OVC initiatives, the U.S. Department of Justice (DO J) has undertaken new II projects to improve Federal/Tribal coordination. President Clinton's April 29, 1994, memorandum, \"Government-to-Government Relations with Native American Tribal Governments,\" led to the implementation of several DOJ programs: the Tribal Courts Project to assist tribes in developing and strengthening their courts; the Tribal Court-DOJ I Partnership Project to strengthen Tribal courts and their abilities to respond to family violence and juvenile issues; the addition of 26 assistant U.S. Attorneys to districts with n high Indian populations; the redesign of training programs to ensure that Federal I prosecutors understand the jurisdictional framework of Tribal lands; the addition of 7 criminal lawyers, who have expertise in child sexual abuse in Indian Country m to the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section of DOJ's Criminal Division; the awarding of 68 grants to Tribal domestic violence programs under the Violence Against Women Act grant program; [] a Tribal CAC demonstration project to serve as a model to establish Tribal Children's Advocacy Centers across Indian Country; and the establishment of an Office of Justice n Programs (OJP) American Indian and Alaskan Natives Office to monitor program support and technical assistance to tdbes and to assist in planning and developing new OJP initiatives.

Notes 1. William C. Canby, Jr., \"American Indian Law in a Nutshell\" (U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit). Other Activities There are other actions that State and Federal agencies can undertake to facilitate cooperative relationships with Tribal agencies. These activities include the development of protocols; provision of training to all agencies involved in cases of child sexual abuse (e.g., law enforcement, prosecution, child protection, and medical and mental health); participation in workshops and Tribally sponsored training; inclusion of Tribal representatives on State and Federal committees, planning panels, and review committees; and informal interaction with Tribal service providers. In addition, State and Federal representatives must be willing to travel to reservations for joint meetings, rather than holding all meetings at government locations to ensure the participation of all interested parties. Similarly, Tribal representatives must be willing to cooperate with Federal and State agencies in investigating and prosecuting cases. Conclusion - I I I I Tribal, State, and Federal coordination of criminal investigation and prosecution is critical to ensuring the best treatment of child victims of sexual abuse and the successful resolution of child sexual abuse cases. OVC and the Department of Justice have undertaken projects to improve coordination among Tribal, State, and Federal agencies and will continue to take an active role in fostering cooperation. The information presented here is a starting point for determining criminal jurisdiction in such cases and coordinating investigative and prosecutorial efforts. The CJA Partnerships for Indian Communities (formally the CJA Discretionary Grant Program for Native Americans) funds programs for child abuse victims on Indian reservations and other locations where Federally recognized Indian tribes exist. This program is the only source of Federal funding for Native American tribes that exclusively I http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/ovc/infores/tribal/tribalbult, htm 9/15/99 Improving Tribal/Federal Prosecution of Child... Page 9 of 10 focuses on lessening the trauma to Tribal child victims by improving the criminal justice process. The program provides funds for enhanced investigation and prosecution of such cases, more efficient case coordination, and improved services to victims. I I The Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) was statutorily created as part of the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (VOCA), as amended in 1988, to support programs that benefit crime victims.

Public Law 280 was a transfer of legal power (jurisdiction) from the federal government to state governments which significantly changed the division of legal authority among tribal, federal, and state governments. Congress gave six states (five states initially - California, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oregon, and Wisconsin; and then Alaska upon statehood) extensive criminal and civil jurisdiction over tribal lands within the affected states (the so-called \"mandatory states\"). Public Law 280 also permitted the other states to acquire jurisdiction at their option. Public Law 280 has generally brought about (1) an increased role for state criminal justice systems in \"Indian country\"(a term which is specifically defined in federal statutes~), (2) a virtual elimination of the special federal criminal justice role (and a consequent diminishment of the special relationship between Indian Nations and the federal government), (3) numerous real and perceived obstacles to individual Nations in their development of tribal criminal justice systems, and (4) an increased and confusing state role in civil related matters. Consequently, Public Law 280 presents a series of important issues and concerns for Indian country crime victims and for those involved in assisting these crime victims. Public Law 280, however, is a complicated statute which has been very controversial since the time of its enactment in 1953. It has often been misunderstood and misapplied by both federal and state governments. Moreover, the practical impact of Public Law 280 has gone way beyond that which was legally required, intended, and contemplated. * Jerry Gardner is the Executive Director of the Tribal Law and Policy Institute, the Administrator for the National American Indian Court Judges Association, and an Adjunct Lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law (Boalt Hail). Ada Pecos Melton is the President of American Indian Development Associates and Administrator for the National Association of Tribal Court Personnel. 18 U.S.C. 1151 defines \"Indian Country\" as \"(a) all Indian lands within the limits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States Government, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and, including rights -of-way running through the reservation, (b) all dependent Indian communities within the borders of the United States whether within the original or subsequently acquired territory thereof, and whether within or without the limits of a state, and (c) all Indian allotments, the Indian titles to which have not been extinguished, including rights-of-way running through the same.\" I I I I I I I I I !

Public Law 83-280, the 280 'h Public Law enacted by the 83 ~ Congress in 19532, was a substantial transfer of jurisdiction from the federal government to the states in Indian country. This transfer of jurisdiction was required (or mandatory) for the states specifically mentioned in the Act and Public Law 280 also permitted other states to acquire jurisdiction. Indian Nations, on the other hand, had no choice in the matter. \"The Indian Nations which were affected by Public Law 280 had to deal with greatly increased state power and state control over a broad range of reservation activities without any tribal consent. Before Public Law 280 was enacted, the federal government and Indian tribal courts shared jurisdiction over almost all civil and criminal matters 3 involving Indians in Indian country. The states had no jurisdiction. With the enactment of Public Law 280, affected states received criminal jurisdiction over reservation Indians. Furthermore, Public Law 280 opened state courts to civil litigation that previously had been possible only in tribal or federal courts. In the affected states, the federal government gave up control over crimes in Indian country (those involving Indian perpetrators and/or victims). Indian Nations lost control over many criminal and civil matters within their respective territories due to the policies of the federal and state governments. 2. Why was Public Law 280 Enacted? Practically every analysis of Public Law 280 begins with a reference to the pendulum of federal policy swing between (1) Indian self-determination with an emphasis upon respecting tribal sovereignty and tribal self-government and (2) Indian \"termination\" with an emphasis upon \"terminating\" Indian Nations in order to assimilate their members into the dominant society. Public Law 280 was enacted in the 1950's - a period of termination and assimilation in Indian country - and it must be examined and understood within the context of the time period in which it was enacted. Public Law 280 was enacted in 1953 at the height of the post-World War II assimilationist period which included (1) the adoption in 1953 of House Concurrent Resolution 108 which established tribal termination as the official federal policy and singled out specific Indian Nations for termination, and (2) the implementation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs \"relocation\" z Act of August 15, 1953, ch. 505, 67 Stat. 588-590 (now codified as 18 U.S.C. 1162, 28 U.S.C. 1360 and other scattered sections in 18 and 28 U.S.C.). 3 Criminal matters are generally illegal (or criminal) acts which involve a violation of the government's criminal laws whereas civil matters are generally actions between private parties brought to enforce a right or gain payment for a wrong. program to encourage Indians to leave the reservations and seek employment in various metropolitan centers 4 The federal courts have generally held that Congress may \"authorize\" states to exercise jurisdiction in Indian country. Public Law 280, however, differed from earlier grants of jurisdiction to the states in that it allowed every state to assume jurisdiction at their own option at any time in the future. Most previous grants of jurisdiction to the states 5 had been limited to some or all the reservations in a single state. They also had generally followed consultation with the individual state and the affected Indian Nations. Public Law 280 itself began as an attempt to confer jurisdiction only on the state of California. Its scope, however, was substantially broadened in the course of the process which lead to its adoption by Congress. The Senate Report of the bill 6 indicates that alleged lawlessness on the reservations and the accompanying threat to state citizens living nearby was the foremost concern of Congress when they passed Public Law 280 in the 1953. Instead of enhancing tribal criminal justice systems, Congress chose to adopt a policy which had the effect of radically shifting the balance of jurisdictional power towards the states and away from the federal government and Indian Nations. 3. Why is Public Law 280 Controversial? From the beginning, Public Law 280 was unsatisfactory to both states and Indian Nations. Public Law 280 inspired widespread criticism and concern from Indians and non-Indians alike. Disagreements arose immediately concerning the scope of powers given to the states and the methods of assuming that power. Indian Opposition Indian opposition to Public Law 280 has focused upon the one-sided process which imposed state jurisdiction on Indian Nations and the complete failure to recognize tribal 4 These termination and relocation policies were implemented by Bureau of Indian Affairs Commissioner Dillon S. Myer who had overseen the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. 5 Act of June 8, 1940, ch. 276, 54 Stat. 249 (criminal jurisdiction to Kansas); Act of May 31, 1946, ch. 279, 60 Stat. 229 (criminal jurisdiction to North Dakota over the Devils Lake Reservation); Act of June 30, 1948, eh. 759, 62 Star. 1161 (criminal jurisdiction to Iowa over the Sac and Fox Reservation); Act of July 2, 1948, eh. 809, 62 Stat. 1224 (criminal jurisdiction to New York) (codified at 25 U.S.C. sec. 232 [1970]); Act of Oct. 5, 1949, ch. 604, 63 SLat. 705 (civil and criminal jurisdiction to California over Agua Caliente Reservation); Act of Sept. 13, 1950, ch. 947, 64 Stat. 845 (civil jurisdiction to New York); (This list does not include the earliest jurisdictional grants to the states, especially the jurisdiction assumed early this century by the State of Oklahoma - It is important to note that Oklahoma Indian Nations were not directly impacted by Public Law 280 and Oklahoma did not take any affirmative legislative action under Public Law 280.) 6 S.REP.No.699, 83d Cong., I\" sess.5 (1953). I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I i I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I sovereignty and tribal self-determination. Public Law 280 required neither the consent of the Indian Nations being affected nor even consultation with these Indian Nations. When he signed it into law, even President Eisenhower expressed misgivings about the lack of tribal consent and urged immediate amendment of the law to require tribal referenda - no such amendment passed Congress until 1968. State Dissatisfaction State dissatisfaction has focused upon the failure of the Act to provide federal funding for states assuming authority under Public Law 280. The states were handed jurisdiction, but denied the funds necessary to finance it (in today's language - an \"unfunded mandate\"). Furthermore, Public Law 280 has been criticized as a source of lawlessness rather than as a remedy. Professor Carole Goldberg, the preeminent legal authority on Public Law 280, has made a compelling case that Public Law 280 is a law which was allegedly designed to cure the problem of\"lawlessness\" on reservations, but which has actually worsened the problem of lawlessness. As Professor Goldberg has statedT: ... Public Law 280 has itself become the source of lawlessness on reservations. Two different and distinct varieties of lawlessness are discernible. First, jurisdictional vacuums or gaps have been created, often precipitating the use of self-help remedies that border on or erupt into violence. Sometimes these gaps exist because no govemment has authority. Sometimes they arise because the government(s) that may have authority in theory have no institutional support or incentive for the exercise of that authority. I will call this kind of lawlessness the \"legal vacuum\" type. Second, where state law enforcement does intervene, gross abuses of authority are not uncommon. In other words, power is uncabined by the law that it is supposed to constrain it. I will call this kind of lawlessness the \"abuse of authority\" type. 4. How has Public Law 280 been Amended since it Became Law in 1953? Congress amended Public Law 280 in 1968 s - fifteen years after it was originally enacted. These 1968 amendments added a tribal consent requirement and authorized states to give back (or retrocede)jurisdiction to the federal government. The tribal consent requirement, however, only applied to future transfers of jurisdiction to the states under Public Law 280. It did not apply to transfers of jurisdiction which had 7 Carole Goldberg-Ambrose, Planting Tail Feathers: Tribal Survival and Public Law 280 (UCLA American Indian Studies Center, 1997), p. 12. s These amendments were part of the 1968 Civil Rights Act. They are now codified at 25 U.S.C. sec. 1321-26. 4 already taken place prior to 1968. Not surprisingly, not a single Indian Nation has consented to state jurisdiction since these 1968 amendments were enacted. 9 The 1968 amendments also included a section which enables any state which had previously assumed jurisdiction under Public Law 280 to offer the return (or retrocession) of all or any measure of its jurisdiction to the federal government by sending a resolution to the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary then has the discretion (or choice) to accept or reject the return of jurisdiction. Under this amendment, however, Indian Nations .do not have a formal role in the retrocession process although Indian Nations have attempted to do so informally. The amendments did not contain any mechanism by which Indian Nations could initiate return jurisdiction on their own or force this retrocession on an unwilling state. 5. Which States are Affected by Public Law 280? [This section could be provided as Exhibit #1 or as a sidebar.] Mandatol T States Public Law 280 conferred criminal and civil jurisdiction on six specifically listed states (the so-called mandatory states) as follows: California Minnesota Nebraska Oregon Wisconsin Alaska ~\u00b0 All Indian country All bldian country, except the Red Lake Reservation All Indian country All lndian country, except the Warm Springs Reservation All Indian country All lndian country, except Metlakatla criminal jurisdiction The original exceptions of the Red Lake, Warm Springs, and Metlakatla Reservations were for Indian Nations which not only successfully demonstrated that they had satisfactory law enforcement mechanisms in place, but successfully objected to being subjected to state jurisdiction. However, most Indian Nations which objected in 1953 were not successful in being excluded from the application of Public Law 280. 9 At least two Indian Nations have been forced to accede to Public Law 280 jurisdiction since 1968 through Congressional recognition legislation which provided that Public Law 280 would apply to their reservation either \"notwithstanding the provisions\" of the 1968 amendments (Mashantucket Pequot Nation in Connecticut, Public Law 98-134) or \"as if they had consented\" to it (Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo in Texas, Public Law 100-89). 10 There were only five mandatory states in the original version of Public Law 280. Alaska was added later by the Act of Aug. 8, 1958, Pub. L. 85-615, 72 Stat.545, in connection with its admission to the Union. 5 I I I I I I I I I I I I i I ! ! I n i I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I A few mandatory states have successfully returned (or retroceded) jurisdiction back to the federal government since the 1968 amendments, including the following: (1) Wisconsin retroceded jurisdiction over the Menominee Reservation in connection with the Menominee Restoration Act (Public Law 93-197). (2) Nebraska retroceded jurisdiction over the Winnebago and Omaha Reservations. (3) Oregon partially retroceded jurisdiction over the Umatilla Reservation. Optional States Public Law 280 also authorized any non-mandatory state to assume civil and/or criminal jurisdiction over Indian country within its borders. These non-mandatory states had the option of taking partial jurisdiction without tribal consent until after the 1968 amendments were enacted. In some instances, these transfers of jurisdiction under Public Law 280 have also been returned (retroceded) back to the federal government, overturned by the courts, or have never been implemented. The optional states fall into two categories - states with disclaimers in their state constitutions limiting state jurisdiction over Indian country and states without these state constitutional disclaimers. For the optional states without disclaimers in their state constitutions, the procedure for accepting Public Law 280 was straightforward. The following states without disclaimers assumed Public Law 280 jurisdiction either in whole or in part over Indian country within their states: Nevada Florida Idaho t~ Iowa - 1955 (Nevada Revised Statutes section 41.430). - 1961 (Florida Statutes Annotated section 285.16). - 1963 (subject to tribal consent)(Idaho Code sections 67-5101/3). - 1967 (Iowa Code Annotated sections I. 12-. 14). There were eight optional states with disclaimers in their state constitutions limiting state jurisdiction over Indian country within their state borders. Congress assumed that these states would have to remove (or repeal) these disclaimers by constitutional amendment before Public Law 280 jurisdiction could be validly transferred. Six of the eight states with disclaimers have enacted legislation claiming full or partial Public Law 280 jurisdiction. Yet five of the six states - Washington, Montana, Arizona, North Dakota, and Utah - have not amended their state constitutions and, consequently, their claims of jurisdiction are subject to legal challenges. The following states with disclaimers have assumed jurisdiction either in whole or in part over Indian country within their states: Washington 12 - 1957 and 1963 (Washington Revised Code section 37.12.010) \" Idaho and Washington asserted jurisdiction over compulsory school attendance, public assistance, domestic relations, mental illness, juvenile delinquency, adoption proceedings, dependent children, and operation of motor vehicles over public roads. ~: Idaho and Washington asserted jurisdiction over compulsory school attendance, public assistance, domestic relations, mental illness, juvenile delinquency, adoption proceedings, dependent children, and operation of motor vehicles over public roads. South Dakota - 1957 and 1961 (civil and criminal actions on highways only) (South Dakota Compiled Laws Annotated sections 1-1 - 17, 1-2-21). Montana - 1963 (Montana Revised Code Annotated section 83-802). North Dakota-1963 (subject to tribal consent)(North Dakota Cent. Code section 27-19-02). Arizona -1967 (air and water pollution)(Arizona Revised Statutes Annotated sections 36-180 I, 36-1856). Utah - 1971 (Utah Code Annotated sections 63-36-9 to 63-36-21). 6. What is the Effect of Public Law 280 in Criminal Actions? The impact of Public Law 280 is most straightforward with regard to criminal actions. It is important, however, to examine separately the legal impact and the practical impact of Public Law 280. Legal Impact The main legal impact of Public Law 280 conceming criminal jurisdiction is that it (1) extended state criminal jurisdiction and the application of state criminal laws onto Indian reservations within the affected states and (2) eliminated special federal criminal jurisdiction over reservation areas in the affected states. In essence, the criminal jurisdiction sections of Public Law 280 shifted the special federal criminal jurisdiction over reservation areas to the state. The grant of criminal jurisdiction to the states was broader (\"to the same extent that such State has jurisdiction over offenses committed elsewhere within the State\") than the limited federal criminal jurisdiction which existed prior to Public Law 280 and, consequently, it expanded the realm of non-Indian control over reservation activities. Exhibit #2 sets out the differences in criminal jurisdiction between states with Public Law 280 and states without Public Law 280. Practical Impact The practical impact of Public Law 280 has generally been much greater than the Act itself legally required. Public Law 280 did not eliminate tribal criminal jurisdiction - in fact, it did not make specific reference to tribal jurisdiction at all. Consequently, most courts and attorneys general have found that Indian Nations retain their inherent sovereign authority with regard to criminal jurisdiction. Thus, although states were delegated broad criminal jurisdiction, that jurisdiction remained concurrent (running together) with the inherent tribal criminal jurisdiction. The federal government, however, viewed Public Law 280 as a license to drop financial and I I I I I I I I I I I I i I i l i ! | I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I technical support for tribal self-government and tribal governmental institutions in the Public Law 280 states. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) used it as an excuse for redirecting federal support on a wholesale basis away fi-om Indian Nations in the \"Public Law 280 states\" and towards all other Indian Nations. The most striking illustration of this redirected federal support concems the funding of tribal law enforcement and tribal courts. In many Public Law 280 states, the BIA refused to support tribal law enforcement and tribal courts on the grounds that Public Law 280 made tribal criminal jurisdiction unnecessary. ~3 As a result of the decision to drop federal support for tribal law enforcement and tribal court systems in Public Law 280 states, many Indian Nations in Public Law 280 states still do not have functioning criminal justice systems. The situation has been changing in recent years. An increasing number of Indian Nations in Public Law 280 states are developing criminal justice systems. In some instances, Indian Nations are creating law enforcement and court systems in connection with a formal Public Law 280 retrocession process. In most instances, however, Indian Nations are simply asserting their concurrent criminal jurisdiction.

What is the Effect of Public Law 280 in Civil Actions? The civil jurisdiction impact of Public Law 280 is less straightforward than the criminal jurisdiction impact. In general, it authorized the application of general state adjudicatory jurisdiction (jurisdiction of courts to judge or adjudicate cases) to reservations in the affected states, but it did not authorize state civil regulatory jurisdiction (jurisdiction of govemment administrative agencies to regulate conduct - see following section). Since federal courts were not authorized to hear many civil actions, Public Law 280 did not transfer federal civil jurisdiction. Instead, it authorized the state to intervene in civil matters (and individuals to file actions in state courts) which had previously been under exclusive tribal jurisdiction and, consequently, greatly expanded the realm of non-Indian control over reservation activities. Exhibit #3 sets out the differences in civil jurisdiction between states with Public Law 280 and states without Public Law 280. The practical impact of Public Law 280 with regard to civil jurisdiction was much more substantial than legally required by the Act itself. Public Law 280 did not eliminate tribal civil jurisdiction. However, as a result of the decision to drop federal support for tribal governmental institutions, many Indian Nations in Public Law 280 states were unable to operate court systems. In recent years, an increasing number of these Indian Nations are again developing court systems. It is important to note that many of these developing tribal courts are initially asserting civil jurisdiction, especially over Indian Child Welfare and child protection matters. The development of criminal justice systems is often delayed due to the high cost of law enforcement and detention facilities required for a fully functional tribal criminal justice system.

What are the Limitations on Public Law 280? There are a number of important limitations on the application of Public Law 280, including the following: (a) D'ust Status: Public Law 280 specifically provided that it did not affect the trust status of Indian lands. It also did not terminate the trust relationship, end tribal sovereign immunity, or exclude Indians in affected states from receiving benefits under federal Indian programs. (b) Limits to State Authority: States may not apply laws related to such matters as environmental control, land use, gambling, and licenses if those laws are part of a general state regulatory scheme. Public Law 280 gave states only law enforcement and civil judicial authority - not regulatory power. It also denied states power to legislate concerning certain matters, particularly property held in trust by the United States and reserved hunting and fishing rights. The state generally cannot tax on Indian reservations. The U. S. Supreme Court ~4 has interpreted Public Law 280 as a law designed only to open state courts to civil and criminal actions involving reservation Indians and not to subject reservations to the full range of state regulation. Finally, there are some matters considered so central to the very definition of the Indian Nations - such as enrollment and certain domestic matters - that state courts may be excluded from hearing such matters. (c) Municipal and County Laws: Public Law 280 may have established that only statewide laws are applicable to reservation Indians - excluding municipal and county laws. Courts have generally excluded the application of local laws since Public Law 280 was not intended to deny Indian Nations their basic governmental functions. (d) Later Federal Laws: Some federal laws enacted after the 1953 enactment of Public Law 280 have reduced the amount of jurisdiction available to the states and simultaneously increased tribal sovereignty and/or federal power. For example, the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act (Public Law 95-608) gave Indian Nations exclusive jurisdiction over certain child custody proceedings involving Indian children, and the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (Public Law 100-487) makes enforcement of state gaming laws a federal rather than a state i'esponsibility. ~4 B~an v. Itasca Coun.tv, 426 U.S. 373 (1976). I0 9. How Does Public Law 280 Affect Indian Country Crime Victims? There are many ways in which Public Law 280 may affect crime victims in Indian country, including the following: (a) Federal Role Eliminated: In states without Public Law 280, the federal criminal justice system has a special role in Indian Country - crimes are otten investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Indian Affairs; major crimes and interracial (Indian v. non-Indian) crimes are prosecuted through the United Skates Attorney's offices; the federal victim witness coordinator is actively involved in these federal cases; etc. In states with Public Law 280, this special federal role is eliminated. (b) Greatly Expanded Role of State Criminal Justice System: In states without Public Law 280, the role of the state criminal justice system in Indian country is generally limited to non-Indian v. non-Indian crimes only. In states with Public Law 280, the role of the state criminal justice system in Indian country is essentially the same as outside Indian country. The prior federal role has been transferred to the state, but the grant of criminal jurisdiction to the states is even greater than the prior federal role. Consequently, Public Law 280 significantly expanded the realm of non-Indian control over reservation activities. (c) Limited Tribal Criminal Justice Systems in Public Law 280 States: As a result of the limited federal support for tribal law enforcement and tribal court systems in Public Law 280 states, many Indian Nations in Public Law 280 states still do not have functioning criminal justice systems. There may not be any tribal law enforcement or tribal court system. If a tribal court does exist, it may only exercise jurisdiction over civil actions. If a tribal criminal justice system does exist, it may be informal and/or have only very limited resources available. (d) Possible Choice of Criminal Justice System: Due to the concurrent jurisdiction of the tribal and state criminal justice systems under Public Law 280, it is possible that a victim of crime may face a choice of criminal justice systems (assuming that there is a functioning tribal criminal justice system) or the possibility of two prosecutions by the separate sovereigns (state and tribal). (e) Lawlessness of the \"Legal Vacuum\" Type: Public Law 280 has otten created what Professor Goldberg identified as lawlessness of the \"legal vacuum\" type. The jurisdictional vacuums or gaps caused by Public Law 280 have often precipitated the use of self-help remedies that border on or erupt into violence. These self-help remedies have developed because (I) no government (either tribal or state) has authority, (2) the perception exists that no government has authority, and/or (3) the government has authority in theory but no institutional support or incentive for the exercise of that authority. 11 I I I I I I I I I i I I i I I I g | l I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I (0 (g) Lawlessness of the \"'Abuse of Authority\" Type: Public Law 280 has often created what Professor Goldberg identified as lawlessness of the \"abuse of authority\" type. There have been many instances in which state law enforcement has intervened, but gross abuses of authority have occurred (power is unleashed by the law that is supposed to constrain it). Mistrust and Hostility between Tribal and State Officials/Communities: On many reservations, Public Law 280 has contributed to a continuing history of mistrust and hostility between tribal and state officials/communities. The controversy surrounding Public Law 280 has contributed to this situation, including the state dissatisfaction with the lack of federal funding and the tribal opposition to the broad unilateral imposition of state law. Furthermore, a common Indian perception in many Public Law 280 states is that state law enforcement claims that they have no authority whenever the Indian Nation asks them to intervene (\"legal vacuum\" lawlessness), but that state law enforcement claims that they have this authority whenever the Indian Nation does not want them to intervene (\"abuse of authority\" lawlessness). Obviously, this situation can present many problems for Indian country crime victims. 12 10. How Do I Determine the Impact of Public Law 280 on an Individual Reservation ? There are a series of questions which need to be answered in order to determine the impact of Public Law 280 upon individual states and reservations, including the following: (a) ls the state one of the mandatory Public Law 280 states? The mandatory Public Law 280 states are Califomia, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oregon,\" Wisconsin, and Alaska (see Exhibit #1). The mandatory states were provided with full transfer of jurisdiction under Public Law 280. (b) Is the state one of the optional Public Law 280 states and, if so, was it a partial or a full assumption of jurisdiction ? There are 10 optional Public Law 280 states - Nevada, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Washington, South Dakota, Montana, North Dakota, Arizona, and Utah (see Exhibit #I). Unlike the mandatory states, these optional states were able to assume Public Law 280 jurisdiction either in whole or in part. Consequently, it is important to determine the specific application of jurisdiction by the individual state. (In addition, there have been other federal laws granting state jurisdiction for individual reservations or states - see footnotes 3 and 7). ( c) Has the state returned or retroceded Public Law 280jurisdiction o1\" is it otherwise no longer in effect? A number of both the mandatory and optional states have retroceded (or returned) jurisdiction back to the federal government since the 1968 Public Law 280 amendments. In addition, some assertions of jurisdiction have been overturned by the courts or were never implemented. (d) Is the specific reservation affected? In many states, Public Law 280 has been applied to some reservations, but not to other reservations. Even if the state is listed as either a mandatory or an optional Public Law 280 state, it may not apply to all of the reservations within that state. 09 Is there a tribal court system? An increasing number of Indian Nations in Public Law 280 states have developed court systems, but the situation varies substantially from state to state and from tribe to tribe. Tribal courts now exist in most of the optional Public Law 280 states. The development of tribal court systems in the mandatory states has generally been more difficult, especially in California and Alaska. The existence of a tribal court system greatly increases the available remedies and services for crime victims. (g) Does the tribal court assert both civil and criminal jurisdiction? Many of the tribal courts which are being developed in Public Law 280 states initially assert only civil jurisdiction due to the high cost of law enforcement and detention 13 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I l i I I g I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I facilities. The rights of a crime victim and the services available to that crime victim may be limited if the only tribal court option is a civil action (for example, a civil domestic violence action does not generally have as much impact as a criminal action since options such as mandatory arrest policies may not be available). (h) Are there tribal law enforcement services and facilities? Many Indian Nations in Public Law 280 states have limited law enforcement services and facilities. The rights of a crime victim may be limited if these services/facilities are non- existent, limited, or severely rationed due to budgetary limitations. (i) What is the relationship between the tribal criminal justice system and the state criminal justice system ? The relationship between the tribal criminal justice system and the state criminal justice system can have a significant impact upon the rights of Indian country crime victims, but this relationship varies substantially from state to state. Some Public Law 280 states have been willing to retrocede Public Law 280 jurisdiction. In some states, this relationship has been particularly difficult, especially in California and Alaska. In other states, the tribal and state justice systems have been able to establish very productive relationships. For example, tribal and state courts in Wisconsin have generally established good working relationships. In fact, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals held that once an Indian Nation has a domestic abuse ordinance in place and a tribal court to enforce it, then the tribal court has exclusive jurisdiction despite Public Law 280.

I I I I I I I This presentation will actively identify the qualitative and quantitative differences in thinking and perceiving between oral tradition cultures and written tradition cultures. Of primary focus will be the effective use of language in investigating, reporting, documenting and presenting legal matters and identifying the destructive nature of professional jargon in abuse and neglect cases. Special emphasis will be placed on identifying the strength and value of personal and family stories as teaching tools in concert with traditionally defined storytelling.

I I ! ! | | n I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I Oral Tradition - More Than Storytelling: Listening to Others, Listening to Ourselves Presenter: Achaessa James, Native Child Advocate King County Dependency CASA Program, Seattle, Washington Oral tradition is the foundation of all tribal traditions. Even those First Nations that had written traditions tended to reserve that method for trade and business, using the oral traditions of oration, singing and storytelling as the means for transmitting social and spiritual teachings. ; Oral tradition includes not only a particular way of speaking but also a different way of listening. Today, oral tradition can be used to increase our visibility in the majority culture and our effectiveness in working with Native populations if we remember a few simple concepts: In Business/Social Interactions Respect for others. People raised with an oral tradition learn to listen in silence, without verbal or mental interruption. Oral traditions teach us to open our minds to the words of others, to hear what that person's truth is, to understand that person's perspective, to sit with those words quietly and then, if appropriate, to respond thoughtfully, perhaps comparing or contrasting with our own experience on the same subject. In this way, even if the listener does not agree, the speaker knows that his or her point has been heard and considered. Group decision making benefits as much by this method as one-to-one communication. Speaking lasL When I sit back in a meeting, letting everyone else speak first and interrupt each other, I am scouting their territory. When I finally do speak, I have the leader's ear. By listening respectfully and contemplating thoughtfully, I can either poke holes in another's strategy and show where mine is stronger, or show where their strategy needs support and how I can help them be more effective - either way, I win. Mixed Messages and Meanings. In working with urban Indian populations it is especially important to remember that forced relocation and systemic abuse are not experiences of the distant past. Most non-Native people have the politically enforced perception that these abuses are of the distant past and are not aware that relocation under various guises, including \"vocational training\", was a common governmental practice up until the early 1980's. The Indian Adoption Project was initiated in 1958 between the BIA and the Child Welfare League of America. In 1975 clearinghouse was jointly established for interstate placement of Indian children in non-Indian families. Studies conducted in 1969 and again in 1974 and 1976 showed that, in most states with large Indian populations, 25- 35% of Indian children had been removed from their homes. The institution of the Indian Child Welfare Act in the mid-'70s, was a direct response to this governmentally-sanctioned kidnapping. Despite this federal legislation, Native families in dependency court have, in the majority of cases, not received active representation for the protection of their children. Not to mention the fact that our children are still actively being stolen from their parents through fraudulent adoptions by non-Natives. -I- In light of all this, professionals in the social service community need to be particularly understanding in comprehending the level of mistrust held by Native people for workers that represent \"the system\". An additional complication is the fact that many of our urban Native peoples speak English as a second language or were raised by parents who spoke English as a second language. For clear communication between Native parents and non-Native ICWA workers it is important to be sure that what you're saying is what's being heard and vice versa. Not everyone uses language in the same way and making the extra effort to clarify your words, seek a clearer meaning of the other person's words, and generally ensure that you're both on the same wavelength can savje aJot of confusion and also serves to build trust with your Native client. In Legal Proceedings/Reporting Avoid the use of acronyms and industry jargon. The use of acronyms (e.g., FAS, FAE, DD, AAD, etc.) and jargon (e.g., unstable home, neurological dysfunction, attachment disorder, developmentally delayed, etc.) in the courtroom and reports to the court are ultimately ineffective and potentially destructive unless accompanied by words that paint a real picture of the family and people involved. Acronyms and jargon allow the court to skim a report without ever creating a real image of a real person, making the process an impersonal function of the system. Strive to be descriptive when reporting. Whether in oral testimony or written reporting, give brief details that put a face on your client. The effect is much different when I say \"This child has serious neurological problems\" without adding \"she screams continuously approximately seven of every nine hours of the day and night.\" Or, \"This child is self-mutilating\" as opposed to \"This two-year old child has deep scars that cover her forearms and legs from self-mutilating scratching.\" Descriptive statements awake the indignity of the court and force the judge or commissioner to take the matter more personally and more seriously. Detail allows those not directly involved with a child to comprehend the seriousness of the situation and creates a desire to stay personally informed about the welfare of the particular child. Effective Speaking Awaken the senses. Just as research has proven there are different styles of learning, so there are different styles of listening. A person's \"attention trigger\" may be visual. tactile, auditory, olfactory, taste or memory related. By activating these triggers, your audience will not only listen more closely to what you have to say, but will feel personally involved in the communication - even in a group situation. Gauging your audienc\u00a2 In a one-on-one situation, just a little preliminary observation will give you clues about a person's attention trigger. Do they dress in bright colors? Is the home so full of music that you can't hear yourself speak (and is this acting as a cushion from reality)? Does the home/person have a distinctive smell (comforting or disturbing)? Is the home full of photographs (memory triggers)? Engaging your audience. In singles or groups, you can use language to effectively trigger your listener's attention. Some simple trigger statements: Tactile - \"Is it warm/cool in here or is it just me?\" This causes your audience to check-in with their bodies and grounds them in the room with you. Visual - \"Did you notice how blue the sky was this morning?'\" Again, this causes visually triggered people to go into their -2- l I I I I I I I I I I I I I i ! g il g I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I memory for the answer to this visual question and unconsciously pay more attention to your following words for whatever images you might next stimulate. Oifactor 3, - \"1 passed a bakery on the street this morning and the smell of fresh bread was delicious.\" Again, a memory trigger and subsequent subconscious attention holder. Storytelling Traditional stories, Every Nation has its traditional stories that are valuable teaching tools. These are especially important in integrating the listener into the community culture and strengthening bonds with community members outside of the immediate family. Once a week or once a month storytellings in a neighborhood gathering place have been known to effectively unite a community on unrelated social and neighborhood issues by creating a sense of specific identity for the neighborhood residents. Personal stories. My father's greatest girls to me were the stories of his childhood. I have worked with many families and troubled youth and almost the only time I ever hear a parent talk about their childhood - to their children - is when they are lecturing the child about behavior or money. Personal stories are especially effective in a family setting because you are a real person to your listener (child or adult) - not some unattainable legendary or mythical figure doing fantastic deeds. Your stories are simple and true (or complicated and true) and knowing that you lived through the experience and learned from it is a valuable gift to your seven generations, giving them a guideline to follow as they grow and come to similar points in their lives. Workshop presentation by: Achaessa James, King County Dependency CASA Program 660 Wildwood ravenwriter@msn.com -3- This article published by the National Indian Child Welfare Association, Portland, OR, in their newsletter \"Pathways\" September/October 1998 Volume 13 Number 4 We hear.., but do we really listen? By Achaessa James Oral traditions teach us to open our minds to the words of others, to hear what that person's truth is, to understand that person's perspective, to contemplate those words quietly and then, if appropriate, to respond thoughtfully. When I was growing up, my father could get almost any one to do just about anything. I remember that even the neighborhood bullies never picked on my friends or me, not because they were afraid of my dad (who was strong and barrel-chested, but rather short), but because they thought he was a cool guy. In retrospect I see that my father's talent was not in pleasing or convincing people, but instead, it was his skillful listening that got the results he wanted. This was an ability he gained not by formal schooling but by sitting on the curb, on the rez, next to his Kwakiutl father, learning to carve and inclining his ear to an oral tradition. A tradition that he had to keep in his heart, because he couldn't share it with the white adoptive family that raised him and beat him because of his half-breed heritage. A tradition and a skill that he later passed on to his daughter, in the garden, at the fishing hole, on long drives, wherever we happened to be together. He would talk; I would listen. I would talk; he would listen. Really listen. For the last 20-plus years now, I have worked in the corporate world and the legal profession, and I see that listening is not a strong suit of the majority culture. I have watched people with far more education than my father or I have fall into nothing jobs. At the same time, both he and I, with barely more than a high school education, have taken on work and responsibilities far exceeding our degreed coworkers. And we both earned the reputation for being effective communicators. I Can think of three cultural distinctions that have made a difference in my life and career: Educational system. In today's corporate world, there are multitudes of books, workshops, seminars and do-it- yourself methods for learning \"The Lost Art of Listening.\" I see it as a natural consequence of an educational system based on written tradition, that listening would be a \"lost art.\" Listening requires a flexibility of mind not present in the rote memorization and recital of the written tradition style of learning. The current educational system teaches people to know the answers before the questions are even fully asked--Jane raises her hand and starts waving it at the teacher, squirming in her seat, answer on her lips, straining to be the \"first\" to answer. I I I I i I I I I I I I I l l i l I ! I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I've seen this same behavior by adults in board meetings, department meetings, etc. (well, except for the waving hands). They verbally trip over each other, interrupting coworkers, no single thought ever getting fully presented, each person grasping the chance to be the \"first\" to give the boss the \"right\" answer. The problem is, in most circumstances, there is no one \"right\" answer and the plausible alternatives get lost in the verbal melee. The result? A corporate world that stagnates because of yes-men giving the expected answers. Which is why, today, a company that wants to flourish spends a lot of time and money training its staffin the \"Lost Art of Listening.\" The listening skills that we develop as an oral-tradition culture have proved, for me, to be the secret weapons of the corporate war. When I sit back in a meeting, letting everyone else speak first and interrupt each other, I am scouting their territory. When I finally do speak, I have the boss's ear. By listening respectfully and contemplating thoughtfully, I can either poke holes in their strategy and show where mine is stronger, or show where their strategy needs support and how I can help them be more effective--either way, I win. Respect for others. There remains a distinction between what I will call Native Listeners (oral tradition cultures) and Listening as a Second Language (written tradition cultures), and that is respect. People raised with an oral tradition learn to listen in silence, without verbal or mental interruption. Oral traditions teach us to open our minds to the words of others, to hear what that person's truth is, to understand that person's perspective, to contemplate those words quietly and then, if appropriate, to respond thoughtfully, perhaps comparing or contrasting with our own experience on the same issue. In this way, even if the listener does not agree, the speaker knows that his or her point has been heard and considered. Group decision making benefits as much by this method as one-to-one communication. This is a demonstration of respect at its finest. (And this was my father's secret for motivating others.) By contrast, people raised with a written tradition are ingrained with the belief that the written word is immutable and therefore what they have read is right and always will be right. So, when they take up Listening as a Second Language, they generally never grasp the respect part. They can learn how to sit quietly while you talk. They can even learn how to parrot back parts of what you said. But the entire time they usually have their own script crowding their brains, waiting to leap out of their mouths the minute you're finished speaking. Often, instead of comparing or contrasting your topic with their own experience, they will discuss how something they read was just like what you were talking about. This is not respect, this is competition. Sharing personal stories. One of my father's greatest gifts to me was the stories of his childhood. I have worked with many families and troubled youths, and almost the only time I ever hear parents talk about their childhood--to their child--is when they are lecturing the child about behavior or money. I My favorite recollections are as a tiny girl, snuggling up against my dad before bed, and him telling stories. Stories like the argument between him and Mrs. S about the ducks and the geese when she took the hot poker out of the stove and chased him out of the house because he was right (I learned the difference between ducks and geese, and I also learned that sometimes it's just not worth it to be right over a minor point). Or'the story of him badly spraining his ankle while working in the field and working all day because he knew he would get beaten if he went in early (I learned that even when you're badly hurt you can still go on and not be wounded for life). Or the story about the time when Mr. S came into the barn with the rubber hose'to ~ive my dad his daily beating, and the 14-year-old boy stood there silently with the pitchfork (I leamed that you don't need to be loud to make a point and that eventually we all have to stand up for ourselves). Or the time he cried when he told me about his dead war buddies (I learned that there are some pains you just learn to live with, and that there will be people who love you enough to just sit and hold you while you cry). As a teenager I never got those \"when I was a child\" lectures from my dad because he knew that I already knew what it was like for him as a child. When I came across situations as I was growing up, and on throughout my 40 years, I could look back and see where my father's stories met my need for immediate advice. And even though he's not alive anymore, I can still hear him telling me what he would do in my shoesmbecause he talked story and I listened.

ACTION: Final Program Guidelines. SUMMARY: The Office for Victims of Crime (OVC), Office of Justice Programs (OJP), U.S. Department of Justice (DO J), is publishing Final Program Guidelines to implement the victim assistance grant program as authorized by the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 10601, et seo. (hereafter referred to as VOCA). EFFECTIVE DATE: These guidelines are effective from October 1, 1996 (Federal Fiscal Year 1997 VOCA grant program), until further revised by OVC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jackie McCann Cleland, Director, State Compensation and Assistance Division, 633 Indiana Avenue, N.W., Washington, INFORMATION: VOCA authorizes federal fmancial assistance to states for the purpose of compensating and assisting victims of crime, providing funds for training and technical assistance, and assisting victims of federal crimes. These Program Guidelines provide information on the administration and implementation of the VOCA victim assistance grant program as authorized in Section 1404 of VOCA, Public Law 98-473, as amended, codified 1- at 42 U.S.C. 10603, and contain information under the following headings: Summary of the Comments to the Proposed Prpgram Guidelines;, Background; Allocation of VOCA Victim .Assistance Application Process; Program Requirements; Financial Requirements; Monitoring; and Suspension and Termination of Funding..The Guidelines are based on the experience gained and legal opinions rendered since the inception of the grant program in 1986, and are in accordance with VOCA. These Final Program Guidelines are all inclusive. Thus, they supersede any. Guidelines previously issued by OVC. OVC, in conjunction with DOJ:s Office of Policy Development, and the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within the Office for Management and Budget (OMB), has determined that these Guidelines do not represent a \"significant regulatory action\" for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 and, accordingly, these Program Guidelines were not reviewed by OMB. In addition, these Program Guidelines will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities; therefore, an analysis of the impact of these rules on such entities is not required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, codified at 5 U.S.C. 601, et sea. The program reporting requirements described in the Pro~am Requirements section have been approved by OMB as required under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3504(h). (OMB Approval Number 1121-0014). SUMMARY OF THE REVISIONS TO THE 1997 FINAL PROGRAM GUIDELINES As a result of comments from the field, recent legislative amendments, and modifications of applicable federal regulations, substantive changes were made to four sections of the Proposed I Program Guidelines, including: the Availability of Fu~nds the Application Process, the Program Requirements, and the Financial Requirements. These changes are summarized in the paragraphs below, and incorporated into the complete text of the Final Program Guidelines for Crime Victim Assistance Grants. The Final Program Guidelines also include several technical corrections that are not listed in this summary because they do not affect policy or program implementation. A. Comments from the Field In the interest of reaching a more di. rse audience and making the review and comment process more convenient for victim service advocates and providers, OVC took several steps. In April, 1996, OVC asked the state VOCA victim assistance program administrators for their comments on the effective edition of the VOCA Victim Assistance Final Program Guidelines (published in October 27, 1995). On the basis of their comments and the suggestions of several other victim advocates, OVC developed Proposed VOCA Victim Assistance Program Guidelines. Throughout the year, the OVC Director and staff met individually and in groups with VOCA administrators and subgrantees to discuss revisions to the Guidelines. In November of 1996, OVC mailed copies of the Proposed Guidelines directly to all of the state VOCA victims assistance and victim compensation program administrators, as well to the representatives of approximately 20 national crime victim advocacy organizations. In early December, the Proposed Guidelines were posted on the OVC Website for review and comment by all interested parties. Finally, the Proposed Guidelines were published in the Fede~ Register on February 18, 1997. Since last Spring, OVC has received approximately 90 recommendations, comments, and questions from VOCA administrators, victim service providers, representatives of national victim organizations, and other victim advocates via telephone, mail, fax, and e-mall. The vast majority of the comments supported the proposed changes to the Guidelines. OVC received comments from experts in elder services that helped OVC redefine \"elder abuse\" and include specific direction regarding respite care for elders, emergency nursing home shelter for victims of elder abuse, and inclusion of adult - care providers in community cooperation efforts. These comments were made by state and national organizations, including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services A~'ninistration on Aging and the National Association of State Units on Aging. OVC also received comments from state and national domestic violence organizations, -~uch as the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence and AYUDA, supporting the proposal to expand VOCA-funded emergency legal \"assistance to include child custody and visitation when such assistance is from providers with a demonstrated history of advocacy on behalf of domestic violence victims. All of the comments received were invaluable in helping OVC prepare the Final Victim Assistance Program Guidelines. A summary of the changes occurring as a result of comments from the field are listed below in the order in which they appear in the Final Program Guidelines. 1. Definition of Crime Victim to Include Financial Harm. In Section I., Background, the definition of crime victim has been modified to specifically include victims of financial exploitation. Although VOCA-funded programs cannot restore the f'mancial losses suffered by victims of fraud, victims are eligible for the counseling, criminal justice advocacy, and other support services offered by VOCA-funded victim assistance programs. 2. Training of Adult Protective Services Personnel. The section on the VOCA Victim Assistance Application Process (III.B.2.c.), which lists allowable uses of the administrative cost provision, has been modified to specifically include training for aging and adult protective service providers. 2 I I I I I I l I I I I I I I I I I I I I ! I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 3. Submission of Administrative Cost Provision Budget. Previous editions of the Guidelines required state grantees to submit a budget itemizing projected administrative fund expenditures and a statement describing the types of activities they would support and how the expenditure was expected to improve the administration of the VOCA program. The State Grantee Application Process section (III.B.2.), which describes the administrative cost provision, has been modified to lessen the burden on state grantees. Those states that use administrative funds must submit a statement to OVC that reports only the amount of the total grant that will be used as administrative funds. A special condition will be added to the award document, and periodic OJP financial reviews will be conducted to ensure states' compliance with the Program Guidelines and OJP Financial Guide to determine whether administrative funds have been used for allowable purposes. 4. Training for Non-VOCA Funded Personnel. The State Grantee Application Process section (III.C.), which outlines the allowable use of training funds, has been expanded to specifically include non-VOCA funded staff in addition to VOCA-funded personnel. 5. Submission of Training Cost Provision Budget. In previous editions of the Guidelines, state grantees were required to submit a budget itemizing projected training expenses and a statement describing the needs of the providers and the goals of the training. The section on the State Grantee Application Process (III.C.), has been modified to lessen the burden on states. States using the VOCA training funds must only report the amount of the total grant that will be used for training. States still must comply with OVC the 20% match requirement and other guidance defining allowable uses for training funds. 6. Definition of Victims of Federal Crime. In response to requests for clarification, the Program Requirements section (IV.A.4.), has been modified to include a def'mition of \"victims of federal crime.\" For the purposes of this program, a victim of federal crime is a victim of an offense that violates a federal criminal statute or regulation. Federal crimes also include crimes that occur in an area where the federal government has jurisdiction, such as Indian reservations, some national parks, some federal buildings, and military installations. 7. Definition of Elder Abuse. The Program Requirements section 0V.A.4.) describing grantee eligibility requirements, has been modified so that the definition of \"elder'abu ~.\" now focuses on describing the offense, rathe~ than on characterizing the victim. Hence, the definition, \"abuse of vulnerable adults,\" has been expanded to include \"the mistreatment of older persons through physical, sexual, or psychological violence; neglect; or economic exploitation and fraud.\" 8. Identifying Underserved Victims of Crime. The Program Requirements section (IV.A.4.) describing the state grantee eligibility requirements, has been modified to encourage states to identify gaps in available services, not just by the types of crimes committed, but also by victims' demographic characteristics. Thus, these Final Guidelines ask grantees to examine the possibility that in a given state, \"underserved\" victims may also be defined by demographic characteristics such as their status as senior citizens, non-English speaking residents, disabled persons, members of racial or ethnic minorities, or by virtue of the fact that they are residents of rural or remote areas, or inner cities. 9. Funding New Programs. There was confusion about OVC's intention regarding the funding of new crime victim programs. Hence, language has been added to Section IV, the Program Requirements (IV.B.3.), clarifying that new programs that have not yet demonstrated a record of providing services may be eligible to receive VOCA funding if they can demonstrate that 25-50 percent of their financial support comes from non-federal sources. States are I responsible for establishing the base level of non-federal support required within the 25-50 percent range. 10. Funding Unfunded Mandates. Recently, many state legislatures have passed laws establishing important new rights for crime victims. OVC wishes to clarify that VOCA funds may be used for the purpose of implementing these laws. Therefore, restrictive language from the previous Guidelines has been eliminated. Please note that VOCA crime victh assistance funds still may not be used to supph, t state and local funds that would otherwise be available for crime victim services. 11. Child Abuse and Adult Protective Service Agencies. Section IV., the Program Requirements section (IV.C), which describes the criteria for eligible subrecipient organizations, has been modified to specifically include child abuse programs and treatment facilities and adult protective service agencies. 12. Legal Service Agencies or Programs with Records of Serving Victims of Domestic Violence. The Program Requirements section (IV.C.5.), which lists the local public agencies eligible to receive VOCA subgrant funds, has been modified to specifically include legal service agencies or programs with a demonstrated history of advocacy on behalf of domestic violence victims, including children. 13. State Grantees as Subrecipients. Section IV., the Program Requirements (IV.C.5), has been modified with regard to subgrants to state grantees. Since the intention of the VOCA grant program is to support and enhance the crime victim services provided by community agencies, state grantees that meet the definition of an eligible subrecipient organization may not award themselves more than 10 percent of their annual VOCA award. This limitation applies to all states and territories, except for the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Republic of Palau. . | *\u00b0 14. Nursing Homes as Emergency Shelters.. Under the Program Requirements section:.. .... (IV.E.l.a.), which lists the allowable costs for. direct services, the Guidelines have been modified to clarify that emergency shelter includes short-term nursing home shelter for elder abuse victims for whom no other safe, short-term residence is available. o 1S. Emergency Legal Assistance. The Program Requirements section (IV.E. 1.a0, which lists the allowable services, activities, and cos~ at the subreeipient level, has been modified to allow subgrantees discretion in providing victims of domestic violence with legal assistance such as child custody and visitation proceedings \"when such actions are directly connected to family violence eases and are taken to ensure the health and safety of the victim.\" The allowable \"Contracts for Professional Services\" section (IV.E.2.g.) also has been modified to include ~sistan.ce With emergency custody and visitation proceedings from providers With a demonstrated history of advocacy on behalf of domestic violence victims. 16. Cost of Respite Care. The Program Requirements, section (IV.E.I.c.), has been modified to specifically state that assistance with participation in criminal justice proceedings may include the cost of caring for a dependent adult when this enables a victim to attend court. 17. Cost of Restitution Advocacy on Behalf of Individuals. The Program Requirement section (IV.E.I.c.), has been modified to state clearly that restitution advocacy on behalf of specific crime victims is an allowable activity. 18. Restorative Justice. In many cases, victims are not familiar with the nature and availability of restorative justice programs. Therefore, the Program Requirements section (IV.E.l.h.), has been modified to clarify that restorative justice opportunities, where crime victims meet with perpetrators, are allowable, if I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I il I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I such meetings are requested \"or voluntarily agreed to\" by the victim. In addition, since it is impossible to guarantee the therapeutic value of any activity, this section of the Guidelines has been further modified to state that restorative justice programs must have \"possible beneficial or\" therapeutic value to crime victims. 19. Allowable Costs for Making Services Accessible to Victims with Disabilities. The Program Requirements section (IV.E.2.d.), listing allowable \"non-direct\" costs and services, has been modified to clarify that VOCA funds may be used to purchase items such as braille equipment for the blind or TTY/TTD machines for the deaf, or to make minor building improvements that make services more accessible to victims with disabilities. Additional guidance can be found in the Office of Justice Programs, Office of the Comptroller, Financial Guide. 20. Advanced Technologies; In the Program Requirements section (IV.E.2.f.), OVC offers the states clarification that all subreeipients receiving VOCA funds for advanced technologies such as computers and victim notification systems must meet the usual program eligibility requirements as set forth in the Guidelines. 21. Electronic Submission of Subgrant Award Reports. In the interest of meeting OVC's mandate to collect and maintain accurate and timely information on the disbursai of VOCA funds, the section describing the subgrant award report requirements (V.A.) has been modified. Beginning with the Federal Fiscal Year {FFY) 1997 VOCA grant award, state grantees are required to transmit their Subgrant Award Report information to OVC via the automated subgrant dial-in system within 90 days of the date of the subaward. Grantees can access the system without incurring a long distance telephone charge by utilizing the subgrant dial-in 1-800 number. OVC will no longer accept manual submission of the Subgrant Award Reports. States and territories outside of the continental U.S. are exempt from the requirement to use the subdial system, but these grantees must complete and submit ,the Subgrant Award Report form, O/P 7390/2A, for each VOCA subrecipien't. B. Legislative Changes 1. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (l'ubl[c Law 104-132). The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-132) (hereafter, \"The Antiterrorisra Act\"), was signed into law on April 24, 195. This legislation contained a number of victh related provisions that amended VOCA, including four provisions concerning the \"Availability of (VOCA victim assistance) Grant Funds.\" a. Higher Base Award (II.C.). The Antiterrorism Act increases the base amount for victim assistance grants from $200,000 to $500,000. The territories of Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and American Samoa will continue to receive a base amount of $200,000, with the Republic of Palau's share governed by the Compact of Free Association between the U.S. and the Republic of Paiau. b. OVC Reserve Fund.(II.B.2.). The Antiterrorism Act authorizes the OVC Director to establish a reserve fund, up to $50 million. Reserve fund monies may be used for supplemental gran~ to assist victims of terrorist acts or mass violence occurring within or outside the U.S. The OVC Director may award reserve funds to the following entities: I) States for providing compensation and assistance to their state residents, who, while outside of the borders of the U.S., become victims of a terrorist act or mass violence. The beneficiaries, however, cannot be persons who are already eligible for compensation under the Omnil~uS Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 5~ I 1986. Individuals covered Under- the Omnibus Diplomatic Security. Act include .those.who are taken. captive because of their relationship with the U.S. government as a member of the U.S. Civil Service, as well as other U.S. citizens, nationals, or resident aliens who are taken captive while rendering service to the U.S. similar to that of civil servants. Dependent family members of such persons also are covered under the Act. 2) Eligible state crime victim compensation and assistance programs for providing compensation and emergency relief for the benefit of victims of terrorist acts or mass violence occurring within the U.S. 3) U.S. Attorneys' Offices for use in coordination with state victim compensation and assistance efforts in providing relief to victims of terrorist acts or mass violence occurring within the U.S. 4) Eligible state compensation and assistance programs to offset fluctuation in the funds during years in which the Fund decreases and additional monies are needed to stabilize funding for state programs. c. Unqbligated Grant Funds (II.B.4.).. Beginning with FFY 1997 VOCA grants, funds not obligated by the end of the grant period, up to an annual national maximum of $500,000, will be returned to the Fund, and not to the General Treasury, as was the practice in previous years. Returned funds in excess of $500,000 in a given year shall be returned to the Treasury. Once any portion of a state's grant is returned to the Fund, the funds must be redistributed according to the formula established by VOCA and the Proposed Program 6~ Guidelines. States are encouraged to monitor closely the expenditure of VOCA ....... \" funds throughout the grant period to avoid returning grant monies to OVC and/or the Treasury. d. Grant Period Extended (II.B.3.). The Antiterrorism Act extended the VOCA victim assistance grant\"period from the year of award plus one, to the year of award plus two. Subsequent legislation further extended the grant period tr the year of award plus three. 2. Omnibus Appropriations Act of 1997. The Omnibus Appropriations Act of 1997 (P.L. 104-208) was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Clinton in September, 1996. This Act further extended the grant period to the year of award plus three. This change is effective for all FFY 1997 grants. The Final Program Guidelines clarify that funds are available for obligation beginning October 1 of the year of the award, through September 30 of the FFY three years later. For example, grants awarded in November, 1996 (FFY 1997) are available for obligation beginning October 1, 1996 through September 30, 2000. This modification is contained in the \"Availability of Funds\" section (II.B.3) of the Final Program Guidelines. C. Changes .in Applicable Federal Regulations 1. Mandatory Enrollment in U.S. Treasury Depart .ment's Automated Clearing House (ACH) Vendor Express Program. In accordance with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, the U.S. Treasury Department revised its regulations regarding federal payments. The Final Program Guidelines have been modified to require that, effective July 26, 1996, all federal payments to state VOCA victim assistance and compensation grantees must be made via electronic funds transfer. States that are new award recipients or those that have previously received funds in the form I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I of a paper check from the U.S. Treasury must enroll in the Treasury Department's ACH Vendor Express program through OJP before requesting any federal funds. This means that VOCA grantees can no longer receive drawdowns against their awards via paper check mailed from the Treasury. Grant recipients must enroll in ACH for Treasury to electronically transfer drawdowns directly to their banking institutions. States that are currently on the Letter of Credit Electronic Certification System (LOCES) will be automatically enrolled in the ACH program. Enrollment forms will be included in the award packet. Enrollment in ACH need only be completed once. This modification is included in the \"Application Process\" section (III.A.6.) of the Final Program Guidelines. 2. Higher Audit Threshold. In response to suggestions made by many recipients of federal grant awards, including VOCA grant recipients, OMB Circular A-133 is being revised. Until the revisions are final, state and local government agencies that receive $100,000 or more in federal funds during their state fiscal year are required to submit an organization- wide financial and compliance audit report. Recipients of $25,000 to $I00,000 in federal funds are required to submit a program- or organization-wide audit report as directed by the granting agency. Recipients receiving less than $25,000 in federal funds are not required to submit a program- or organization-wide f'mancial and compliance audit report for that year. Nonprofit organizations and institutions of higher education that ~ $300,000 or more in federal funds per year shall have an organization-wide financial and compliance audit. Grantees must submit audit reports within 13 months after their state fiscal year ends. or an audit of the federal program, and state and local governments receiving less than': $25,000 in any fiscal year were exempt from audit requirements. This modification is contained in the \"Financial Requirements\" section 0V.A.) of the Proposed Program Guidelines. GUIDELINES FOR CRIME VICTIM ASSISTANCE GRANTS I. BACKGROUND In 1984, VOCA established the Crime Victims Fund (Fund) in the U.S. Treasury and authorized the Fund to receive deposits of fines and penalties levied against criminals convicted of federal crimes. Tl'ds Fund provides the source of funding for carrying out all of the activities authorized by VOCA. .- OVC makes annual VOCA crime victim assistance grants from the Fund to states. The primary purpose of these grants is to support the provision of services to victims of crime throughout the Nation. For the purpose of these Program Guidelines, services are defined as those efforts that (1) respond to the emotional and physical needs of crime victims; (2) assist primary and secondary victims of crime to stabilize their lives after a victimization; (3) assist victims to understand and participate in the criminal justice system; and (4) provide victims of crime with a measure of safety and security such as boarding- up broken windows and replacing or repairing locks. For the purpose of the VOCA crime victim assistance grant program, a crime victim is a person who has suffered physical, sexual, financial, or emotional harm as a result of the commission of a crime. I I I Previously, states that received $100,000 or more in federal financial assistance in any fiscal year were required to have a single audit for that year. States and subrecipients receiving at least $25,000, but less than $100,000, in a fiscal year had the option of performing a single audit . VOCA gives latitude to state grantees to determine how VOCA victim assistance grant funds will best be used within each state. However, each state grantee must abide by the minimal requirements outlined in VOCA and these Program Guidelines. I II. ALLOCATION OF VOCA VICTIM ASSISTANCE FUNDS A. Distribution of the Crime Victims Fund OVC administers the deposits made into the Fund for programs and services, as specified in VOCA. The amount of funds available for distribution each year is dependent upon the total deposits into the Fund during the preceding Federal Fiscal Year (October 1 through September 30). Pursuant to Section 1402 (d) of VOCA, deposits into the Fund will be distributed as follows: 1. The first $3,000,000 deposited in the Fund in each fiscal year is available to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC) for administrative costs to carry out the functions of the judicial branch under Sections 3611 and 3612 of Title 18 U.S. Code. (Legislation is being drafted to repeal this provision. If passed by Congress and signed by the President, AOUSC will no longer receive an allocation from the Fund.) 2. Of the next $10,000,000 deposited in the Fund in a particular fiscal year, a. 85% shall be available to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for grants under Section 4(d) of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act for improving the investigation and prosecution of child abuse cases; b. 15% shall be available to the Director of the Office for Victims of Crime for grants under Section 4(d) of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act for assisting Native American Indian tribes in developing, establishing, and operating programs to improve the investigation and prosecution of child abuse eases. 3. Of the remaining amount deposited in the Fund in a particular fiscal year, .. .--., , ... :: . . | a. 48.5% shall be available for victim \" compensation grants; b. 48.5% shall be available for victim assistance grants; and ......:. I I c. 3% shall be available for demonstration projects and training and technical assistance services to eligible crime victim assistance programs and for the financial : \"pport of services to victims of federal \u00a2 me by eligible crime Victim assistance pr on'ams. B. Availability of Funds 1. VOCA Victim Assistance Grant Formula. All states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands, and Palau (hereinafter referred to as \"states\") are eligible to apply for, and receive, VOCA victim assistance grants. See Section 1404(d)(1) of VOCA, codified at 42 U.S.C. 10603(d)(1). I I I I I 2. Reserve Fund. As the result of provisions in the Antiterrorism Act amending VOCA, the OVC Director is authorized to retain funds in a reserve fund, up to $50 million. The Director may utilize the reserve funds in order to: a. Award supplemental grants to assist victims of terrorist acts or mass violence outsi.de or within the U.S. The OVC Director may grant reserve funds for such purposes to the following entities: 1) States for providing compensation and assistance to their state residents, who while outside of the U.S. become victims of a terrorist act or mass violence. The beneficiaries, however, cannot be persons who are already eligible for compensation under the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986. I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I Individuals covered under the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act include persons who are taken captive because of their relationship with the U.S. Government as a member of the U.S. Civil Service, as well as other U.S. citizens, nationals, or resident aliens who are taken captive while rendering service to the U.S. similar to that of civil servants. Dependent family members of such persons also are covered under the Omnibus Diplomatic Security Ac 2) Eligible state crime victim compensation and assistance programs for providing emergency relief, including crisis assistance, training, and technical assistance for the benefit of victims of terrorist acts or mass violence occurring within the U.S. 3) U.S. Attorney's Offices for use in coordination with state victim compensation and assistance efforts in providing relief to vietirns of terrorist acts or mass violence occurring within the U.S. b. Offset Fluctuations in Fund. The Director of OVC may also use the reserve fund to offset fluctuations in Fund deposits for state compensation and assistance programs in years in which the Fund decreases and additional monies are needed to stabilize programs. will be returned to the Crime Victims Fund. In a given fiscal year, no more than $500,000 of the remaining unobligated funds can be returned to the Fund. Amounts in excess of $500,000 shall be returned to the Treasury. Once any portion of a state's grant is returned to the Fund, the funds must be redistributed according to the rules established by VOCA and the Final Program Guidelines, so states are encouraged to monitor closely the expenditure of VOCA funds throughout the grant period to ensure that no funds arc returned. C. Allocation of Funds to States From the Fund deposits available for victim assistance grants, each state grantee receives a base amount of $500,000, except for the territories of Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and American Samoa, which are eligible to receive a base amount of $200,000. The Republic of Palau's share is governed by the Compact of Free Association between the U.S. and the Republic of Palau. The remaining Fund deposits are distributed to each state, based upon the state's population in relation to all other states, as determined by current census data. D. Allocation of Funds within the States The Governor of each state designates the state agency that will administer the VOCA victim assistance grant program. The designated agency establishes policies and procedures, which must meet the minimum requirements of VOCA and the Program Guidelines. I i I I I 3. Grant Period. Federal legislation passed in 1996 also makes victim assistance grant funds available for expenditure throughout the FFY of award as well as in the next three fiscal years. The FFY begins on October 1 and ends on September 30. For example, grants awarded in December, 1996 (FFY 1997) are available for obligation beginning October 1, 1996 through September 30, 2000. 4. Grant Deobligations. VOCA grant funds not obligated at the end of the award period 9 VOCA funds granted to the states are to be used by eligible public and private nonprofit organizations to provide direct services to crime victims. States have sole discretion for determining which organizations will receive funds, and in what amounts, as long as the recipients meet the requirements of VOCA and the Program Guidelines. State grantees are encouraged to develop a VOCA program funding strategy, which should consider the following: the range of victim services I throughout the state and within communities; the unmet needs of crime victims; thg demographic profile of crime victims; the coordinated, cooperative response of community organizations in organizing services for crime victims; the availability of services to crime victims throughout the criminal justice process; and the extent to which other sources of funding are available for services. State grantees are encouraged to expand into new service areas as needs and demographi s of crime change within the state. For example, ,hen professional training, counseling, and de .riefings are made available to victim assistance providers, dispatchers, and law enforcement officers in rural or other remote areas, services to victims in these areas improve dramatically. Victim services in rural or remote areas can also be improved by using VOCA funds to support electronic networking through computers, police radios, and cellular phones. Many state grantees use VOCA funds to stabilize victim services by continuously funding selected organizations. Some state grantees end funding to organizations after several years in order to fund new organizations. Other state grantees limit the number of years an organization may receive VOCA funds. These practices are within the state grantee's discretion and are supported by OVC, when they serve the best interests of crime victims within the state. State grantees may award VOCA funds to organizations that are physically located in an adjacent state, when it is an efficient and cost- effective mechanism available for providing services to victims who reside in the awarding state. When adjacent state awards are made, the amount of the award must be proportional to the number of victims to be served by the adjacent- state organization. OVC recommends that grantees enter into an interstate agreement with the adjacent state to address monitoring of the VOCA subrecipient, auditing federal funds, managing noncompliance issues, and reporting requirements. States must notify 0VC of each VOCA award made to an organization in another state. 20 = . ...... ~*~Z~ ~ b.~I.~.\" Ill. VOCA VICTIM ASSISTANCE APPLICATION PROCESS A. State Grantee Application Process Each year, OVC issues a Program Instruction and Application Kit to each designated state agency. The Application Kit contains the necessary forms and information required to apply for VOCA grant funds, including the Application for Federal Assistance, Standard Form 424. The amount for which each state may apply is included in the Application Kit. At the time of application, state grantees are not required to provide specific information regarding the subrecipients that will receive VOCA victim assistance funds. Completed applications must be submitted on or before the stated deadline, as determined by OVC. In addition to the Application for Federal Assistance, state grantees shall submit the following information: 1. Single Audit Act Information, specifically, the name and address of the designated cognizant federal agency, the federal agency assigned by OMB, and the dates of the state fiscal year. 2. Certifications Regarding Lobbying, Debarment, Suspension, and Other Responsibility Matters; Drug-Free Workplace requirements; Civil Rights Compliance, and any other certifications required by OJP and OVC. I.n addition, states must complete a disclosure form specifying any lobbying activities that are conducted. 3. An assurance that the program will comply with all applicable nondiscrimination requirements. 4. An assurance that in the event a federal or state administrative agency makes a finding of discrimination after a due process hearing, on the grounds of race, color, religion, origin, sex, or disability against the program, .\u00b0..... I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I the program will forward a copy of the finding to OJP, Office for Civil Rights (OCR). 5. The name of the Civil Rights contact person who has lead responsibility for ensuring that all applicable civil fights requirements are met and who shall act as liaison in civil fights matters with OCtL 6. Enrollment in Automated Clearing House (ACH). State agencies that are new award recipients, or those that have previously received funds in the form of a paper cheek from the U.S. Treasury, must enroll in the Treasury Department's ACH Vendor Express program through OJP before any federal funds will be disbursed. States that are currently on the Letter of Credit Electronic Certification System (LOCES) will be automatically enrolled in the ACH program. Enrollment in ACH need only be completed once. 7. Administrative Cost Provision Notification. States must indicate in a letter transmitting their annual grant application whether they intend to use the administrative cost' provision. Additional information about the administrative cost provision is set forth in the following section. B. Administrative Cost Provision for State Grantees Each state grantee may retain up to, but not more than, 5% of each year's grant for administering the VOCA victim assistance grant at the state grantee level with the remaining portion being used exclusively for direct services to crime victims or to train direct service providers in accordance with these Program Guidelines, as authorized in Section 1404C0)(3), codified at 42 U.S.C. 10603 Co)(3). Administrative funds must be expended during the project period for which the grant was awarded. States are not authorized to roll-over administrative funds from one project period to the next. The administrative cost provision is available only to the state grantee and not to VOCA subrecipients. State grantees are not required to match the portion of the grant that is 1t used for administrative purposes. The state administrative agency may charge any federally approved indirect cost rate to this grant However, any indirect costs requested must be paid from the 5 percent administrative funds. This administrative cost provision is to be used by the state grantee to expand, enhance, and/or improve the state's previous l~vel of effort in administering the VOCA victim assistance grant program at the state level and to support activities and costs that impact the delivery .and quality of servi~s to crime victims throughout the state. Thus, grantees will be required to certify that VOCA administrative funds grill not be used to supplant state funds. This information will assist OVC in evaluating requests to use administrative funds. State grantees will not be in violation of the nonsupplantation clause if thereis a decrease in the state's previous financial commitment towards the administration of the VOCA grant programs in the following situations: 1) A serious loss of revenue at the state level, resulting in across-the- board budget restrictions. 2) A decrease in the number of \"state-supported\" staff positions used to meet the state's \"maintenance of effort\" in administering the VOCA grant programs. States are required to notify OVC if there is a decrease in the amount of its previous financial commitment to the cost of administering the VOCA program. State grant.ees are not required to match the portion of the grant that is used for administrative purposes. 1. The following are examples of activities that are directly related to managing the VOCA grant and can be supported with administrative funds: a. Pay salaries and benefits for staff and consultant fees to administer and manage the fmanciai and programmatic aspects of VOCA; ! b. Attend OVC-sponsored and other relevant technical assistance meetings that address issues aad concerns to state administration of victims' programs; c. Monitor VOCA Victim Assistance subrecipients, and potential subrecipients, provide technical assistance, and/or evaluation and assessment of program activities; \" d. T trchase equipment for the state grantee such s computers, software, fax machines, copyi:.~, machines; e. Train VOCA direct service providers; f. Purchase memberships in crime victims organizations and victim-related materials such as curricula, literature, and protocols; and g. Pay for program audit costs; h. Pay for indirect costs at a federally approved indirect cost rate that when applied, does not exceed the 5 percent administrative cost allowance. 2. The following activities impact the delivery and quality of services to crime victims throughout the state and, thus, can be supported by administrative funds: a. Develop strategic plans on a state and/or regional basis, conduct surveys and needs assessments, promote innovative approaches to serving crime victims such as through the use of technology; b. Improve coordination efforts on behalf of crime victims with other federally funded programs and with federal, state, and local agencies and organizations; c. Provide training on crime victim issues to state, public, and nonprofit organizations that serve or assist crime victims such as law enforcement officials, prosecutors, judges, 12 corrections personnel, social service :, workers, child and youth service providers, aging and adult protective service providers, and mental health, and medical professionals; d. Purchase, . print, and/or develop publications such as traL, fing manuals for service providers, victim services directories, and brochures; e. Coordinate and develop, protocols, policies, and procedures that promote systemic change in the ways crime victims are treated and served; and f. Train managers of victim set:vice agencies. Each state grantee that chooses to use administrative funds is required:to submit a statement to OVC reporting the amount of the total grant that will be used as administrative funds. State grantees may notify OVC when the decision is made to exercise this option or at the time the Application for Federal Assistance is submitted. In addition, the grantee must maintain adequate documentation to support the expenditure of these funds. A state may modify projections set forth in their application by notifying OVC, in writing, of the revised amount of the total grant that will be used as administrative funds. Failure to notify OVC of modifications will prevent the state from meeting its obligation to reconcile its State-wide Report with its Final Financial Status Report. Administrative grant funds can only support that portion of a staff person's time devoted to the VOCA assistance program. If the staff person has other functions, the proportion of their time spent on the VOCA assistance program must be documented using regular time and attendance records. The documentation must provide a clear audit trail for the expenditure of grant funds. State grantees may choose to award administrative funds to a \"conduit\" organization that assists in I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I selecting qualified subrecipients and/or reduces the state grantee's administrative burden in implementing the grant program. However, the use of a \"conduit\" organization does not relieve the state grantee from ultimate programmatic and financial responsibilities. The VOCA funds used for training by the state grantee must be matched at 20 percent of the total project cost, cash or in-kind, and the source of the match must be described. For further information regarding match requirements, see the section on Subrecipient Organization Eligibility Requirements (IV.B.). I C. Use of Funds for Trainin~ ' W. PROGRAM REQUIREIVIENTS I I' I I I I I I I I I I I I State grantees have the option of retaining a portion of their VOCA victim assistance grant for conducting state-wide and/or regional trainings of victim services staff. The maximum amount permitted for this purpose is one percent of the state's grant. State grantees that choose to sponsor statewide or regional trainings are not precluded from awarding VOCA funds to subrecipients for other types of staff development. Statewide or regional training supported with training funds should target a diverse audience of victim service providers and allied professionals, including VOCA funded and non-VOCA funded personnel, and should provide opportunities to consider issues related to types of crime, gaps in services, coordination of services, and legislative mandates. Each training activity must occur within the grant period, and all training costs must be obligated prior to the end of the grant period. VOCA grant funds cannot be used to supplant the cost of existing state administrative staff or related state training efforts. Each state grantee that chooses to use training funds is required to submit a statement to OVC reporting the amount of the total grant that will be used to pay for training. Grantees must maintain adequate documentation to support the expenditure of these funds. A state may modify projections set forth in their application by notifying OVC of the revised amount of the total grant that will be used as training funds. Failure to notify OVC of modifications will prevent the state from meeting its obligation to reconcile its State-wide Report with its Final Financial Status Report. A. State Grantee Eligibility Requirements Whenapplying for th, VOCA victim assistance grant, state grantees at required to give assurances that the following conditions or requirements will be met: 1. Must Be an Eligible Organization. States should ensure that only eligible organizations receive VOCA funds, and that these funds are used only for services to vict'.nns of crime, except those funds that the state grantee uses for training victim service providers and/or administrative purposes, as authorized by Section 1404(b) codified at 42 U.S.C. 10603(b). See section E. Services, Activities, and Costs at the Subrecipient Level for examples of direct servicesto crime victims. 2. Nonsupplantation. VOCA crime victim assistance grant funds will be used to enhance or expand services and will not be used to supplant state and local funds that would otherwise be available for crime victim services. See Section 1404(a)(2)(c), codified at 42 U.$.C. I0603(a)(2)(C). This supplantation clause applies to state and local public agencies only. 3. Priority Areas. Priority shall be given to victims of sexual assault, domestic abuse, and child abuse. Thus, a minimum of 10% of each FFY's grant (30% total) will be allocated to each of these categories of crime victims. This grantee requirement does not apply to VOCA subrecipients. Each state grantee must meet this requirement, unless it can demonstrate to OVC that: (I) a 13 ! \"priority\" category is currently receiving significant amounts of financial assistance from the state or other funding sources; (2) a smaller amount of financial assistance, or no assistance, is needed from the VOCA victim assistance grant program; and (3) crime rates for a \"priority\" category have diminished. 4. \"Previously Underserved\" Priority Areas. An additional 10% of each VOCA grant will be allocated to victims of violent crime (other than \"priority\" category victims) who were \"previously underserved.\" These underserved victims of either adult or juvenile offenders may include, but are not limited to, victims of federal crimes; survivors of homicide victims; or victims of assault, robbery, gang violence, hate and bias crimes, intoxicated drivers, bank robbery, economic exploitation and fraud, and eider abuse. For the purposes of this program, a victim of federal crime is a victim of an offense that violates a federal criminal statute or regulation. Federal crimes also include crimes that occur in an area where the federal government has jurisdiction, such as Indian reservations, some national parks, some federal buildings, and military installations. For the purposes of this program, elder abuse is defined as the mistreatment of older persons through physical, sexual, or psychological violence, neglect, or economic exploitation and fraud. To meet the underserved requirement, state grantees must identify crime victims by the types of crimes they have experienced (e.g., drunk driving, sexual assauit, or domestic violence). States are encouraged to also identify gaps in available services by victims' demographic characteristics. For example, in a given state, \"underserved\" victims may be best defined according to their status as senior citizens, non-English speaking residents, persons with disabilities, members of racial or ethnic minorities, or by virtue of the fact that they are 14 residents of rural or remote areas, or inner ..L cities. Each state grantee has latitude for determining the method for identifying \"previously underserved\" crime victims, which may include public hearings, needs assessments, task forces, and meetings with state-wide victim services agencies. Each state grantee must m~et this requirement, unless it can justify to OVC that (a) services to these vlcti~ of violent crime are receiving significant amounts of financial ~, i.~ance from the state or other funding so~ ces; Co) a smaller amount of financial assistar .e, or no assistance, is needed from the VOCA victim assistance grant program; and (c) crime rates for these victims of violent crime have diminished. 5. Financial Record Keeping and Program Monitoring. Appropriate accounting, auditing, and monitoring procedures will be used at the grantee and subrecipient levels so that records are maintained to ensure fiscal control, proper management, and efficient disbursement of the VOCA victim assistance funds, in accordance with the OJP Financial Guide, effective edition. 6. Compliance with Federal Laws. Compliance with all federal laws and regulations applicable to federal assistance programs and with the provisions of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) applicable to grants. 7. Compliance with VOCA. Compliance by the state grantee and subrecipients with the applicable provisions of VOCA and the Final Program Guidelines. 8. Required Reports Submitted to OVC. Programmatic and financial reports shall be submitted. [See program Requirements (Section IV.) and Financial Requirements (Section V.) for reporting requirements and timelines.] I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 9. Civil Rights. Prohibition of Discrimination for Recipients of Federal Funds. No person in any state shall, on the grounds of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, or disability be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be subjected to discrimination under, or denied employment in connection with any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance, pursuant to the following statutes and regulations: Section 809(c), Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 3789d, and Department of Justice Nondiscrimination Regulations, 28 CFR Part 42, Subparts C, D, E, and G; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2000d, et seo.; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 794; Subtitle A, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 12101, et..s_~, and Department of Justice regulations on disability discrimination, 28 CFR Pan 35 and Part 39; Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended, 20 U.S.C. 1681-1683; and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6101, et seo. 10. Obligation to Report Discrimination Finding. In the event a federal or state court or adminis~ative agency makes a finding of discrimination on the grounds of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, or disability against a recipient of VOCA victim assistance funds, state grantees are required to forward a copy of the finding to the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) for OJ-P. 11. Obligation to Report Other Allegations/Findings. In the event of a formal allegation or a finding of fraud, waste, and/or abuse of VOCA funds, state grantees are required to immediately notify OVC of said finding. State grantees are also obliged to apprise 0VC of the status of any on-going investigations. 15 12. Coordination with State VOCA Compensation Program and Federal Eaw Enforcement. OVC encourages state grantees to coordinate their activities with their state's VOCA compensation program and the U.S. Attorneys' Offices and FBI Field Offices within their state. 0nly with an emphasis on coordination will a continuum of services be ensured for all crime victims. Coordination strategies could include inviting Compensation Program Directors and Federal Victim-Witness Coordinators to serve on subgrant review committees; providing Compensation Program Directors and Federal Victim-Witness Coordinators with a list ofVOCA-funded organizations; attending meetings organized by Compensation Program Directors and Federal Victim-Witness Coordinators regarding the provision of victim assistance services; providing training activities for subrecipients to learn about the compensation-program; developing joint guidance, where applicable, on third-party payments to VOCA assistance organizations; and providing training for compensation program staff on the trauma of victimization, particularly for victims of economic crime and survivors of homicide victims. B. Subrecipient Organization Eligibility Requirements VOCA establishes eligibility criteria that must be met by all organizations that receive VOCA funds. These funds arc to be awarded to subrccipients only for providing services to victims of crime through their staff. Each subreeipient organization shall meet the following requirements: 1. Public or Nonprofit Organization. To be eligible to receive VOCA funds, organizations must be operated by public or nonprofit organization, or a combination of such organizations, and provide services to crime victims. I 2. Record of Effective Services. Demonstrate a re6ord of providing effective services to crime victims. This includes having the support and approval of its services by the community, a history of providing direct services in a cost- effective manner, and financial support from other sources. 3. New Programs. Those programs that have not yet demonstrated a record of providing services may be eligible to receive VOCA funding, if they can demonstrate that 25-50 percent of their financial support comes from non-federal sources. It is important that organizations have a variety of funding sources besides federal funding in order to ensure their financial stability. States are responsible for establishing the base level of non-federal support required within the 25-50 percent range. 4. Program Match Requirements. The purpose of matching contributions is to increase the amount of resources available to the projects supported by grant funds. Matching contributions of 20% (cash or in-kind) of the total cost of each VOCA project (VOCA grant plus match) are required for each VOCA-funded project and must be derived from non-federal sources, except as provided in the OJP Financial Gu_qj.~ide effective edition (Part III. Post Award Requirements, Chapter 3. Matching or Cost Sharing). All funds designated as match are restricted to the same uses as the VOCA victim assistance funds and must be expended within the grant period. Match must be provided on a project-by-project basis. Any deviation from this policy must be approved by OVC. For the purposes of this program, in-kind match may include donations of expendable equipment, office supplies, workshop or classroom materials, work space, or the monetary value of time contributed by professionals and technical personnel and other skilled and unskilled labor, if the services they provide are an integral and necessary part ofa funded project. The value placed on donated services must be consistent with the rate of compensation paid for similar work in the subrecipient's organization. If the required ...... skills are not found in thesubrecipient's organization, the rate of compensation must be consistent with the labor market. In either case, fringe benefits may be included in the valuation. The value placed on loaned or donated equipment may not exceed its fair market value. The value of donated space may not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent appraL I of comparable space and facilities in private..-owned buildings in the same~locality. a. Record Keeping. VOCA recipients and their subrecipients must maintain records that clearly show the source, the amount, and the period during which the match was allocated. The basis for determining the value of personal services, materials, equipment, and space must be documented. Volunteer services must be documented, and to the extent feasible, supported by the same methods used by the subrecipient for its own paid employees. The state has primary responsibility for subrecipient compliance with the requirements. State grantees are encouraged not to require excessive amounts of match. b. Exceptions to the 20% Match. eve sets a lower match requirements for. 1) Native American Tribes/Organizations Located on Reservations. The match for new or existing VOCA subrecipients that are Native American tribes/organizations located on reservations is 5% (cash or in-kind) of the total VOCA project. For the purpose of this grant, a Native American tribe/organization is defined as any tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community, which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the U.S. I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I to Native Americans because of their status as Native Americans. A reservation is defined as a tract of land set aside for use of, and occupancy by, Native Americans. 2) The U.S. Virgin Islands, and all other territories and possessions of the U.S., except Puerto Rico, are not required to match VOCA funds. See 48 U.S.C. 1469a(d). 3) OVC may ~ rive the match requirement if. :traordinary need is documented by State VOCA administrators. 5. Volunteers. Subrecipient organizations must use volunteers unless the state grantee determines there is a compelling reason to waive this requirement. A \"compelling reason\" may be a statutory or contractual provision concerning liability or confidentiality of counselor/victim information, which bars using volunteers for certain positions, or the inability to recruit and maintain volunteers after a sustained and aggressive effort. 6. Promote Community Efforts to Aid Crime Victims. Promote, within the community, coordinated public and private efforts to aid crime victims. Coordination may include, but is not limited to, serving on state, federal, local, or Native American task forces, commissions, working groups, coalitions, and/or multi-disciplinary teams. Coordination efforts also include developing written agreements that contribute to better and more comprehensive services to crime victims. Coordination efforts qualify an organ;7~on to receive VOCA victim assistance funds, but are not activities that can be supported with VOCA funds. 7. Help Victims Apply for Compensation Benefits. Such assistance may include identifying and notifying crime victims of the availability of compensation, assisting them with application forms and procedures, obtaining necessary documentation, afi~dr checking on claim status. 8. Comply with Federal Rules Regulating Grants. Subrecipients must comply with the applicable provisions of VOCA, the Program Guidelines, and the requirements of the OJP Financial Guide, effective edition, which in- cludes maintaining appropriate programmatic and financial records that fully disclose the amount and disposition of VOCA funds received. This includes: financial documentation for disbursements; daily time and attendance records specifying time devoted to allowable VOCA victim services;.client files; the portion of the project supplied by other sources of revenue; job description.v, contracts for services; and other records which facilitate an effective audit. 9. Maintain Civil Rights Information. Maintain statutorily required civil rights statistics on victims served by race, national origin, sex, age, and disability, within the timetable established by the state grantee.; and permit reasonable access to its books, documents, papers, and records to determine whether the subrccipient is complying with applicable civil rights laws. This requirement is waived when providing a service, such as telephone counseling, where soliciting the information may be inappropri_ate or offensive to the crime victim. 10. Comply with State Criteria. Subrecipients must abide by any additional eligibility or service criteria as established by the state grantee including submitting statistical and programmatic information on the use and impact of VOCA funds, as requested by the grantee. 11. Services to Victims of Federal Crimes. Subrecipients must provide services to victims of federal crimes on the same basis as victims of state/local crimes. ?. No Charge to Victims for-VOCA-Funded ..E:~'ices. Subrecipients must provide services tct'~rime victims, at no charge, through the VOCA-funded project. Any deviation from this provision requires prior approval by the state grantee. Prior to authorizing subrecipients to generate income, OVC strongly encourages administrators to carefully weigh the following considerations regarding federal funds genera- ring income for subrecipient organizations.. a. The purpose of the VOCA victir- assistance grant program is to pro',,, e services to all crime victims regardle ; of their ability to pay for services rendered or availability of insurance or other third-party payment resources. Crime victims suffer tremendous emotional, physical, and financial losses. It was never the intent of VOCA to exacerbate the impact of the crime by asking the victim to pay for services. b. State grantees must ensure that they and their subrecipients have the capability to track program income in accordance with federal financial accounting requirements. All VOCA-funded program and match income, no matter how large or small, is restricted to the same uses as the VOCA grant. Program income can be problematic because of the required tracking systems needed to monitor VOCA=funded income and ensure ft',at it is used only to make additional services available to crime victims. For example: VOCA often funds only a portion of a counselor's time. Accounting for VOCA program income generated by this counselor is complicated, involving careful record keeping by the counselor, the subrccipient program, and the state. 13. Client-Counselor and Research Information Confidentiality. Maintain confidentiality of client-counselor information, as required by state and federal law. 3.8 14. Confidentiality of Research Information. Except as otherwise provided by federal law, no recipient of monies under VOCA shall use or reveal any research or statistical information furnished under this program by any person and identifiable to any specific private person for any purpose other than the purpose for which such information was obtained in accordance with VOCA. Such information, and any copy of such information, shall be immune from legal process and shall not, without the consent of the person ft~shing such information, be admitted as evidence or used for any purpose in any action, suit, or other judicial, legislative, or administrative proceeding. See Section 1407(- d) of VOCA codified at 42 U.S.C. |0604. These provisions are intended, among other things, to ensure the confidentiality of information provided by crime victims to counselors working for victim services programs receiving VOCA funds. Whatever the scope of application given this provision, it is clear that there is nothing in VOCA or its legislative history to indicate that Congress intended to override or repeal, in effect, a state's existing law governing the disclosure of information which is supportive of VOCA's fundamental goal of helping crime victims. For example, this provision would not act to override or repeal, in effect, a state's existing law pertaining to the mandatory reporting of suspected child abuse. See .P.ennhurst School and Hospital v. HaIderman, et al., 451 U.S. l (1981 ).. Furthermore, this confidentiality provision should not be interpreted to thwart the legitimate informational needs of public agencies. For example, this provision does not prohibit a domestic violence shelter from acknowledging, in response to an inquiry by a law enforcement agency conducting a missing person investigation, that the person is safe in the shelter. Similarly, this provision does not prohibit access to a victim service project by a federal or state agency seeking to determine whether federal and state funds are being utilized in accordance with funding agreements. I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I .C. Eligible Subrecipient Organizations VOCA specifies that an organization must provide services to crime victims and be operated by a public agency or nonprofit organization, or a combination of such agencies or organizations in order to be eligible to receive VOCA funding. Eligible organizations include victim services organizations whose sole mission is to provide services to crime victims. These organizations include, but are not limited to, sexual assault and rape treatment centers, domestic violence programs and shelters, child abuse programs, intervention, questioning of victims and\" witnesses, investigation of the crime,an~l follow-up activities may no_At be paid for wita VOCA funds. 2. Religiously-Affifiated Organizations. Such organizations receiving VOCA funds must ensure that services m-e offered to all crime victims without regard to religious atTdiation and that the receipt of services is not contingent upon participation in a religious activity or event. I centers for missing children, mental health State Victim Compensation 3/ . Crime services, and other community-based victim :Agencies. Compensation programs, including I I I I I I I I I I I I coalitions and support organizations including those who serve survivors of homicide victims. In addition to victim services organizations, whose sole purpose is to serve crime victims, there are many other public and nonprofit organizations that have components which offer services to crime victims. These organizations are eligible to receive VOCA funds, if the funds are used to expand or enhance the delivery of crime victims' services. These organizations include, but are not limited to, the following: I. Criminal Justice Agencies. Such agencies as law enforcement organizations, prosecutors' offices, courts, corrections departments, and probation and paroling authorities are eligible to receive VOCA funds to help pay for victims' services. For example, prosecutor-based victim services may include victim-witness programs, victim notification, and victim impact statements, including statements of pecuniary damages for restitution. Corrections-based victim services may include victim notification, restitution advocacy, victim-offender mediation programs, and victim impact panels. Police- based victim services may include victim crisis units or victim advocates, victim registration and notification, and cellular phone and alarm services for domestic abuse victims. In general, VOCA funds may be used to provide crime victim services that .exceed a law enforcement official's normal duties. Regular law enforcement duties such as crime scene both centralized and decentralized programs, may receive VOCA assistance funds if they offer direct services to crime victims that extend beyond the essential duties of compensation staff such as claims investigations, distribution of-information about compensation and referral to other sources of public and private assistance. Such services would include assisting victims in identifying and accessing needed services and resources. 4. Hospitals and Emergency Medical Facilities. Such organizations must offer crisis counseling, support groups, and/or other types of victim services. In addition, state grantees may only award VOCA funds to a medical facility for the purpose of performing forensic examinations on sexual assault victims if (I) the examination meets the standards established by the state, local prosecutor's office, or state-wide sexual assault coalition; and (2) appropriate crisis counseling and/or other types of victim services are off.red to the victim in conjunction with the examination. 5. Others. State and local public agencies such as mental health service organizations, state/local public child and adult protective services, state grantees, legal services agencies and programs with a demonstrated history of advocacy on behalf of domestic violence victims, and public housing authorities that have components specifically trained to serve 19 I crime victims. Since the intention of the VOCA grant program is to support . and. e .nh. ante the crime victim services provided by community agencies, state grantees that meet the definition of an eligible subrecipient organization may not subaward themselves more than I 0 percent of their annual VOCA award. This limitation applies to all states and territories, except for the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the ..... Republic of Palau. D. Ineli~bh Recipients of VOCA Funds Some public and nonprofit organizations that offer services to crime victims are not eligible to receive VOCA victim assistance funding. These organizations include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. Federal Agencies. This includes U.S. Attorneys Offices and FBI Field Offices. Receipt of VOCA funds would constitute an augmentation of the federal budget with money intended for state agencies. However, private nonprofit organizations that operate on federal land may be eligible subreeipients of VOCA victim assistance grant funds. 2. In-Patient Treatment Facilities. For example, those designed to provide treatment to individuals with drug, alcohol, and/or mental health-related conditions. E. Services, Activities~ and Costs at.the Subre: cipient Level 1. Allowable Costs for Direct Services. The following is a listing of services, activities, and costs that are eligible for support with VOCA victim assistance grant funds within a subrecipient's organization: a. Immediate Health and Safety. Those services which respond to the immediate emotional and physical needs (excluding medical care), of crime victims such as crisis intervention; accompaniment to hospitals for medical examinations; hotline counseling; 2.0 emergency food, clothing, transportation, and shelter (including emergency, short- \"_ -- term nursing home shelter for elder abuse victims for whom no other safe, short-term residence is available); and other .. emergency services that are intended to restore the victim's sense of security. This includes services which offer an immediate measure of safety to crime victims such as boarding-up broken windows and replacing or repairing locks. Also allowable is emergency legal assistance.such as filing restraining orders and obtaining emergency custody/visitation rights when such actions are directly connected to family violence cases and are taken to ensure the health and safety of the victim. b. Mental Health Assistance. Those services and activities that assist the primary and secondary victims of crime in understanding the dynamics of victimization and in stabilizing their lives after a victimization such as counseling, group treatment, and therapy. \"Therapy\" refers to intensive professional psychologi- cal/psychiatric treatment for individuals, couples, and family members related to counseling to provide emotional support in crises arising from the occurrence of crime. This includes the evaluation of mental health needs, as well as the actual delivery of psychotherapy. e. Assistance with Participation in Criminal Justice Proceedings. In addition to the cost of emergency legal services noted above in section a. \"Immediate Health and Safety\", there are other costs associated with helping victims participate in the criminal justice system that also are allowable. These services may include advocacy on behalf of crime victims; accompaniment to criminal justice offices and court; transportation to court; child care or respite care to enable a victim to attend court; notification of victims regarding trial dates, ease disposition information, and parole consideration I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I procedures; and assistance with victim impact statements. State grantees may also fund projects devoted to restitution advocacy on behalf of specific crime victims. VOCA funds cannot be used to pay for non- emergency legal representation such as for divorces, or civil restitution recovery efforts. d. Forensic Examinations. For sexual assault victims, forensic exams are allowable costs ortl}' to the extent that other funding sources (such as state compensation or private insurance or public benefits) are unavailable or insufficient and, such exams conform with state evidentiary collection requirements. State grantees should establish procedures to monitor the use of VOCA victim assistance funds to pay for forensic examinations in sexual assault eases. e. Costs Necessary and Essential to Providing Direct Services. This includes pro-rated costs of rent, telephone service, transportation costs for victims to receive services, emergency transportation costs that enable a victim to participate in the criminal justice system, and local travel expenses for service providers. f. Special Services. Services to assist crime victims with managing practical problems created by the victimization such as acting on behalf of the victim with other service providers, creditors, or employers; assisting the victim to recover property that is retained as evidence; assisting in filing for compensation benefits; and helping to apply for public assistance. g. Personnel Costs. Costs that are directly related to providing direct services, such as staff salaries and fringe benefits, including malpractice insurance; the cost of advertising to recruit VOCA-funded personnel; and the cost of training paid and volunteer staff. h. Restorative Justice. Opportunities for crime victims to meet with perpetrators, if such meetings are requested or voluntarily 21 agreed to by the victim and have possible beneficial or therapeutic value to crime victims. State grantees that plan to fund this type of service should closely review the criteria for conducting these meetings. At a minimum, the following should be considered: (1) the safety and security of the victim; (2) the benefit or therapeutic value to the victim; (3) the procedures for ensuring that participation of the victim and offender are oluntary and that. everyone underst~ ~ the nature of the meeting, (4) the provision of appropriate support and accompaniment for the victim, (5) appropriate \"debriefing\" opportunities for the victim after the meeting or panel, (6) the credentials of the facilitators, and (7) the opportunity for a crime victim to withdraw from the process at any time. State grantees are encouraged to discuss proposals with OVC prior to awarding VOCA funds for this type of activity. VOCA assistance funds cannot be used for victim-offender meetings which serve to replace criminal justice proceedings. 2. Other Allowable Costs and Services. The services, activities, and costs listed below are not generally considered direct crime victim services, but are often a necessary and essential activity to ensure that quality direct services are provided. Before these cos'ts can be supported with VOCA funds, the state grantee and subr.ecipient must agree that direct services to crime victims cannot be offered without support for these expenses; that the subrec- ipient has no other source of support for them; and that only limited amounts of VOCA funds will be used for these purposes. The following list provides examples of such items: a. Skills Training for Staff. VOCA funds designated for training are to be used exclusively for developing the skills of direct service providers .including paid staff and volunteers, so that they are better able to offer quality services to crime victims. An example of skills development is training focused on how to respond to a victim in crisis. VOCA funds can be used for training both VOCA-funded and non-V0CA-funded service providers who work within a VOCA recipient organization, but VOCA funds cannot be used for management and aclministrative training for executive directors, board members, and other individuals that do not provide direct services. b. Training Materials. VOCA funds can be used to purchase materials such as books, training manuals, and videos for direct service providers, within the VOCA-funded organization, and can support the costs of a trainer for in-service staff development. Staff from other organizations can attend in- service training activities that are held for the subrecipient's staff. c. Training Related Travel. VOCA funds can support costs such as travel, meals, lodging, and registration fees to attend training within the state or a similar geographic area. This limitation encourages state grantees and subrecipients to first look for available training within their immediate geographical area, as travel costs will be minimal. However, when needed training is unavailable within the immediate geographical area, state grantees may authorize using VOCA funds to support training outside of the geographical area. For example, VOCA grantees may benefit by attending national conferences that offer skills building training workshops for victim assistance providers. d. Equipment and Furniture. VOCA funds may be used to purchase fianiture and equipment that provides or enhances direct services to crime victims, as demonstrated by the VOCA subrecipient. VOCA funds cannot support the entire cost of an item that is not used exclusively for victim-related activities. However, VOCA funds can support a prorated share of such an :item. In addition, subrecipients cannot use VOCA funds to purchase equipment for another organization or individual to perform a victim-related service. Examples of allowable costs may include beepers; typewriters and word processors; video- tape cameras and players for interviewing children; two-way mirrors; and equipment and furniture for shelters, work spaces, victim waiting rooms, and childr~ :'s play areas. The costs of furniture, equipment such as braille equipment or TTY/TTD machines for the deaf, or minor building alterations/improvements that make victims services more accessible to persons with disabilities are allowable. Refer to the OJP Financial Guide, effective edition, before these types of decisions are made. e. Purchasing or Leasing Vehicles Subrecipients may use VOCA funds to purchase or lease vehicles if they can demonstrate to the state VOCA administrator that such an expenditure is essential to delivering services to crime victims. The VOCA administrator must give ~ approval for all such purchases. f. Advanced Technologies. At times, computers may increase a subrecipient's ability to reach and serve crime victims. For example, automated victim notification systems have dramatically improved the efficiency of victim notification and enhanced victim security. In order to receive a grant for advanced technologies, each subrecipient must meet the program eligibility requirements set forth in section IV.B. of the Guidelines, Subrecipient Organization Eligibility Requirements. In making such expenditures, VOCA subrecipients must describe to the state how the computer equipment will enhance services to crime Q I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I m \u00b0. I I I I I I I I I I I I I i I I I I \u00b0 Q victims; how it will be integrated into and/or enhance the subredpient's current system; the cost of installation; the cost of training staff to use the computer equipment; the on- going operational costs, such as maintenance agreements, supplies; and how these additional costs will be supported. Property insurance is an allowable expense as long as VOCA funds support a prorated share of the cost of the insurance payments. State grantees that authorize equipment to be purchased with VOCA funds must establish policies and procedures on the ar.,quisition and disbursement of the equipment, in the event the subrecipient no longer receives a VOCA grant. At a minimum, property records must be maintained with the following: a description of the property and a serial number or other identifying number; identification of title holder; the acquisition date; the cost and the percentage of VOCA funds supporting the purchase; the location, use, and condition of the property; and any disposition data, including the date of disposal and sale price. (See OJP Financial Guide, effective edition.) g. Contracts for Professional Services. VOCA funds generally should not be used to support contract services. At times, however, it may be necessary for VOCA subrecipients to use a portion of the VOCA grant to contract for specialized services. Examples of these services include assistance in filing restraining orders or establishing emergency custody/visitation rights (the provider must have a demonstrated history of advocacy on behalf of domestic violence victims); forensic examinations on a sexual assault victim to the extent that other funding sources are unavailable or insufficient; emergency psychological or psychiatric services; or sign and/or interpretation for the deaf or for crime victims whose primary language is not English. Subrecipients are prohibited from using a majority of VOCA funds for contracted 23 services which contain administrative, overhead, and other indirect costs included in the hourly or daily rate. h. Operating Costs. Examples of allowable operating costs include supplies; equipment use fees, when supported by usage logs; printing, photocopying, and postage; brochures which describe available services; and books and other victim- related materials. VOCA funds may support administrative time to complete VOCA-required time and attendance sheets and programmatic documentation, reports, and statistics; adminislrative time to maintain crime victims' records; and the pro-rated share of audit costs. i. Supervision of Direct Service Providers. State grantees may provide VOCA funds for supervision of direct service providers when they determine that such supervision is necessary and essential to providing direct services to crime victims. For example, a state grantee may determine that using VOCA funds to support a coordinator of volunteers or interns is a cost-effective way of serving more crime victims. j. Repair and/or Replacement of Essential Items. VOCA funds may be used for repair or replacement of items that contribute to maintaining a healthy and/or safe environment for crime victims, such as a furnace in a shelter. In the event that a vehicle is purchased with VOCA funds, related items, such as routine maintenance and repair costs, and automobile insurance are allowable. State grantees are cautioned to scrutinize each request for expending VOCA funds for such purposes to ensure the following: (I) that the building or vehicle is owned by the subrecipient organization and not rented or leased, (2) all other sources of funding have been ex- hausted, (3) there is no available option for providing the service in another location, (4) that the cost of the repair or replacement is reasonable considering the value of the building or vehicle, and (5) the cost of the repair or replacement is pro-rated among all sources of income. k. Public Presentations. VOCA funds may be used to support presentations that are made in schools, community centers, or other public forums, and that are designed to identify crime victims and provide or refer them to needed services. Specifically, activities and costs related to such programs including presentation materials, brochures, and newspaper notices can be supported by VOCA funds. 3. Non-Allowable Costs and Activities. The following services, activities, and costs, although not exhaustive, cannot be supported with VOCA victim assistance grant funds at the subgrantee level: a. Lobbying and Administrative Advocacy. VOCA funds cannot support victim legislation or administrative reform, whether conducted directly or indirectly. b. Perpetrator Rehabilitation and Counseling. Subrecipients cannot knowingly use VOCA funds to offer rehabilitative services to offenders. Likewise, VOCA funds cannot support services to incarcerated individuals, even when the service pertains to the victimization of that individual. c. Needs Assessments, Surveys, Evaluations, Studies. VOCA program funds may not be used to pay for efforts conducted by individuals, organizations, task forces, or special commissions to study and/or research particular crime victim issues. d. Prosecution Activities VOCA funds cannot be used to pay for activities that are directed at prosecuting an offender and/or improving the criminal justice system's effectiveness and efficiency, such as witness \"\" I notification and management activities and .... \" expert testiinony at a trial. In additi6n; II victim witness protection costs and subsequent lodging and meal expenses are considered part of the criminal justice II agency's responsibility and cannot be supported with VOCA funds, n g e. Fundraising activities. L Indirect Organizational Costs. The costs .~ liability insurance on buildings; capitm raprovements; security guards and body gaards; property losses and expenses; real estate purchases; mortgage payments; and construction may not be supported with VOCA funds. g. Property Loss. Reimbursing crime victims for expenses incurred as a result of a crime such as insurance deductibles, replacement of stolen property, funeral expenses, lost wages, and medical bills is not allowed. h. Most Medical Costs. VOCA funds cannot pay for nursing home care (emergency short-term nursing home shelter as described in section IV.E. 1.a. is allowable), home health-care costs, in- patient treatment costs, hospital care, and other types of emergency and non- emergency medical and/or dental treatment. VOCA victim assistance grant funds cannot support medical costs resulting from a victimization, except for forensic medical examinations for sexual assault victims. L Relocation Expenses. VOCA funds cannot support relocation expenses for crime victims such as moving expenses, security deposits on housing, ongoing rent, and mortgage payments. However, VOCA funds may be used to support staff time in locating resources to assist victims with these expenses. j. Administrative Staff Expenses. Salaries, fees, and reimbursable expenses I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I associated with administrators, board members, executive directors, consultants, coordinators, and other individuals unless these expenses are incurred while providing direct services to crime victims. k. Development of Protocols, Interageney Agreements, and Other Working Agree- ments. These activities benefit crime victims, but they are considered examples of thetypes of activities that subreeipients undertake as part of th-~r role as a victim services organization, x rich in turn qualifies them as an eligible VOt k subreeipient. !. Costs of Sending Individual Crime Victims to Conferences. m. Activities Exclusively Related to Crime Prevention. V. PROGRAM REPORTING-\" REQUIREMENTS State grantees must adhere to all reporting requirements and timelines for submitting the required reports, as indicated below. Failure to do so may result in a hold being placed on the drawdown of the current year's funds, a hold being placed on processing the next year's grant award, or can result in the suspension or termination of a grant. A. Subgrant Award Reports A Subgrant Award Report is required for each organization that receives VOCA funds and uses the funds for such allowable expenses including employee salaries, fringe benefits, supplies, and rent. This requirement applies to all state grantee awards including grants, contracts, or subgrants and to all subrecipient organizations. Subgrant Award Reports are not to be completed for organizations that serve only as conduits for distributing VOCA funds or for organizations that provide limited, emergency services, on an hourly rate. to the VOCA subrecipient organizations. .'qcrviccs :llltl are to be included on th.e subrecipient's Subgrant Award Report. 1. Reporting Deadline. State grantees are required to submit to OVC, within 90 days of making the subaward, Subgrant Award Report information for each subrecipient of VOCA victim assistance grant funds. 2. Electronic Submission. State grantees shall transmit their Subgrant Award Report information to OVC via the automated subgrant system. By utilizing the subgrant dial-in number (1-800/838-0106), grantees can access the system without incurring a long distance telephone charge. States and territories outside of the continental U.S. are exempt from the requirement to use the subdial system, but these grantees must complete and submit the Subgrant Award Report form, OJP 7390/2A, for each VOCA subrecipient. 3. Changes to Subgrant Award Report. If the Subgrant Award Report information changes by the end of the grant period, state grantees must inform OVC of the changes, by revising the information via the automated subgrant subdial system. The total of all Subgrant Award Reports submitted by the state grantee must agree with the Final Financial Status Report (Standard Form 269A) that is submitted at the end of the grant period. B. Performance Report 1. Reporting Deadline. Each state grantee is required to submit specific grant performance data on the OVC-provided Performance Report, form No. OJP 7390/4. by December 31 of each year. 2. Administrative Cost Provision. For those state grantees who opt to use a portion of the VOCA victim assistance grant for administrative costs, the l~erformance Report will be used to describe how the funds were actually used and the impact of the 5% administrative ftmds on lhc state grantee's ability to expand, enhance, and improve services to crime victims. State grantees who choose to use a portion of their VOCA victim assistance grant for administrative costs must maintain a clear audit trail of all costs supported by administrative funds and be able to document the value of the grantee's previous commitment to administering VOCA. VI. FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS As a condition of receiving a grant, state gr~ tees and subrecipients shall adhere to the financia. -,nd administrative provisions set forth in the OJP Financial Guide and applicable OMB Circulars and Common Rules. The following section describes the audit requirements for state grantees and subrecipients, the completion and submission of Financial Status Reports, and actions that result in termination of advance funding. A. Audit Responsibilities for .Grantees and Subrecipients Audits of non-profit institutions and institutions of higher education must comply with the organizational audit requirements of OMB Circular A-133, which states that recipients who expend $300,000 or more during their fiscal year in federal funds during their fiscal year, are required to submit an organization-wide financial and compliance audit report within 13 months after the close of each fiscal year during the term of the award to their cognizant federal agency. State and local units of government must comply with the organizational audit requirements of OMB circular A-128, which states that recipients of $25,000 of federal funds during their fiscal year, are required to submit an audit report to their cognizant agency. Recipients who receive less than $25,000 in federal funds are exempt from the audit requirement. IL Audit Costs Audit costs incurred at the grantee (state) level are determined to be an administrative expense, and ~r 6 may be paid with the allowable five percent, for administration. Subrecipients may use VOCA funds to support the pro-rated share audit costs. C. Financial Status Report for State Grantees Financial Status Reports (269A) are required from all state agencies. A Financial\" Status Report shall be submitted to the Office of the Comptroller for each calendar quarter in which the grant is active. This Report is due even though no obligations or expenditures were incurred during the reporting period. Financial Status Reports shall be submitted to the Office of the Comptroller, by the state, within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter. Calendar quarters end March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31. A Final Financial Status Report is due 120 days after the end of the VOCA grant. D. Termination of Advance Ftinding to State Grantees If the state grantee receiving cash advances by direct Treasury deposit demonstrates an unwillingness or inability to establish procedures that will minimize the time elapsing between cash advances and disbursements, O.IP may terminate advance funding and require the state to finance its operations with its own working capital. Payments to the state will then be made to the state by the ACH Vendor Express method to reimburse the grantee for actual cash disbursements. It is essential that the grantee organization maintain a minimum of cash on hand and that drawdowns of cash are made only when necessary for disbursements. VII. MONITORING A. Office of the Comptroller The Office of the Comptroller conducts periodic reviews of the financial policies, procedures, and records of VOCA grantees and subrecipients. Therefore, upon request, state grantees and subrecipients must allow authorized representatives to access and examine all records, books, papers. I I I I I I I I I I I I I I i I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I il I I case files, or documents related to the grant, use of administrative funds, and all subawards. B. Office for Victims of Crime OVC conducts on-site monitoring in which each state grantee is visited a minimum of once every three years. While on site, OVC personnel will review various documents and files such as (1) program manuals and procedures gov~'ning the VOCA grant program; (2) reports for the grantee and all VOCA subreeipients; (3) the state ,n'antee's kit, procedures, and uidelines for subawarding VOCA funds; and (4) u, other state grantee and subreeipient records and files. In addition, OVC will visit selected subrecipients and will review similar documents such as (1) reports; (2) policies and procedures governing the .organization and the VOCA funds; (3) programmatic records of victims' services; and (4) timekeeping records and other sf2pporting documentation for costs supported by VOCA funds. VIII. SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION OF FUNDING If, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, OVC finds that a state has failed to comply substantially with VOCA, the OJ\"P Financial Guide (effective edition), the Final Program Guidelines, or any implementing regulation or requirement, OVC may suspend or terminate funding to the state and/or take other appropriate action. At such time, states may request a hearing on the justification for the suspension and/or termination of VOCA funds. VOCA subreeipients, within the state, may not request a heating at the federal level. However, VOCA subreeipients who believe that the state grantee has violated a program and/or financial requirement are not precluded from bringing the alleged violation(s) to the attention of OVC. 27 I q.

ACTION: Final Program Guidelines. SUMMARY: The Office for Victims of Crime (OVC), Office of Justice Programs (OIP), U.S. Department of Justice (DOY) is publishing Final Program Guidelines to implement the victim compensation grant program as authorized by the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 10601, et se__eq. ('hereafter referred to as VOCA). EFFECTIVE DATE: From October I, 1996 (Federal Fiscal Year 1997 VOCA grant prograrn), tmtil further revised by OVC. I I ! I I FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: i Jackie McCarm Cleland, Director, State Compensation and Assistance Division, 633 Indiana Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20531; telephone number (202) (This is not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: VOCA provides federal financial assistance to states for the i purpose of compensating and assisting victims of crime, providing funds for training and technical assistance, and assisting victims of federal crimes. IThese Final Program Guidelines provide information on the administration and implementation of the i VOCA victim compensation grant program as authorized in Section 1403 of VOCA, Public Law 98- 473, as anaended, codified at 42 U.S.C. 10602 and 1 10603b, and contain the following information: Summary of the Comments on the Proposed Program Guidelines; Background; Funding Allocation and Application Process; Program Requirements; Financial Requirements; Monitoring; and Suspension and Termination of Funding. These Final Program Guidelir-.s are based on the experience gained and legal op ions rendered since the inception of the grant prol am in 1986, and are iai accordance with VOCA. These Final. Program Guidelines are all inclusive. Thus, they supersede any Guidelines previously issued by OVC. The Office of.lustice Programs, Office for Victims of Crime, in conjunction with the Office of Policy Development, DO], and the Office af l.tLformation and Regulatory Affaks, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), has determined that this rule is not a \"significant regulatory action\" for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and, accordingly, these Final Program Guidelines were not reviewed by OMB. In addition, it has been determined that these Final Program Guidelines will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of sm'Al entities; therefore, an analysis of the impact of these Guidelines on such entities is not required try'~e Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et The program reporting requirements described in the Program Requirements section have been approved by the OMB as required under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3504(h). (OMB Approval Number 1121-0014.) SI/MMARY OF TILE REVISIONS TO TIIE 1997 PROPOSED PROGR.AM GUIDELINES Proposed VOCA Victim Compensation Program Guidelines were distributed to interested individuals and organizations for the purpose of soliciting comments. In September, 1996, OVC asked the state VOCA victim compensation program administrators attending tim an:lttal co;l\"ercacc of the National ssociation of Crime Victim Compensation Boards fACVCB) for their comments. In September, OVC ~o mailed copies of the Proposed Guidelines toall the state VOCA victim compensation and sistanee program administrators, as well as to the eeutive d/rectors of national victim organizations. /C received comments from state VOCA victim mpensation and assistance administrators, ~resentatives of national victim organizations, and e state legislator. In total, over 18 different z)m--tendations, questions, and comments were eiv, '.. a result of the comments from the field, recent islative amendments, and modifications of )licable federal regulations, substantive changes \"e made to four sections of the Proposed Program [deIines, including: the AvailabiliW of Funds, the 91ieation Process, the Program Requirements, and Financial Requirements. These changes are maarized in the paragraphs below, and )rporated into the complete text of the Final ~ram Guidelines for Crime Victim Compensation nts._._,. The Final Program Guidelines also include :rat technical corrections that are not listed in this tmary because they do not affect policy or lementation of the Guidelines. \". .'omments from the Field ~.dministrative Cost Provision. i.\" Indirect Cost. Some respondents questioned OVC's prohibiting the use of these funds for indirect cost and noted that this was inconsistent with rules governing other O.I'P formula grant programs. Thus, tiffs restriction has been eliminated from the \"Availability of Funds\" section of the Final Program Guidelines. 2. Delivery and Quality of Services. Respondents also noted that VOCA compensation programs, like VOCA assistance programs need to measure the impact of. their activities on the delivery and quality of scrvicc.s to crime victims throughout their state. Thus, the following activities can now be supported by VOCA victim compensation administrative funds: a. Improving coordination efforts on behalf of crime victims with other O.IP Offices and Bureaus and with federal, state, and local agencies and organizations; \" b. Providing training on crime victim compensation program issues such as application and eligibility requirements and range \" of compensable expenses, to state, public, and nonprofit organizations that serve or assist crime victims such as law enforcement officials, victim wimess coordinators, corrections personnel, social service workers, victim service providers, and mental health and medical professionals; c. Purchasing, printing, and/or developing applications, brochures and other relevant publications such as training manuals which describe the compensation application process, eligibility criteria, and range of benefits, available for crime victims; and d. Developing protocols, policies, and procedures that promote coordination of victim compensation and victim assistance services and improve the ways crime victims are treated and served; B. Victim Cooperation with Law Enforcement. OVC received numerous inquires concerning the VOCA provision which requires, as a condition of eligibility, that a program promote victim cooperation with the reasonable requests of.law enforcement. ,Many victims of\" crime cannot qualify for compensation because they havc not complied with reporting and cooperating requirements found in most state statutes. \"l'hcrc arc ,ninny cc;~sosls for Ihis. \u00ae Q I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I .dcluding fear of reprisal, a belief by the victim that the police are insensitive, ineffective, or biased, and other reasons. Historically, the most under reported I crimes were rape, sexual assault, and domestic violence. Moreover, when many of these victims do report, they frequently miss the 72-hour reporting I requirement used as a condition of eligibility in most state compensation programs. I In light of these facts, and in to comments response from VOCA program administrators ar ' other crime victim advocates, OVC has modifi~ ' the Final I Program Although state c .me victim Guidelines. compensation programs maintain the authority and -discretion to establish their own standards for I \"reasonable cooperation,\" OVC encourages state compensation program staff'to meet with victims and i victim service providers to carefully review whether state statutes, program guidelines, and policies are responsive to the needs of crime victims and to i determine possible barriers that might impede a victim's cooperation with law enforcement. I Possible impediments include compelling health or safety reasons, such as apprehension regarding personal safety, fear of retaliation, and intimidation by I the offender or others. For example, some victims may be reluctant to cooperate fuIly with law enforcement after receiving threats of violence or even d ....... : :>.k~t themselves and their children from the offender. I Age, psychological, culturaI, or linguistic barriers may also influence the extent of victim cooperation with law enforcement. For instance, there may be I special barriers deterring a child senior young or citizen from \"reasonable cooperation.\" Likewise, embarrassment and shame may delay the reporting of I assault, and cultural and language differences sexual may diminish a victim's access to the criminal justice i . system. In setting the standard for victim cooperation with law i enforcement, the state program should determine how much weight to give to these considerations. I VOCA's ooperatlon with the reasonable requests of f~C * law enforcement\" requirement may be fulfilled by utilizing the following criteria or any other criteria the state believes is necessary to encourage victim cooperation with law enforcement. For example, a state may: 1. Require a victim to report the crime to a law enforcement agency;, 2. Require a victim to report the crime to an appropriate governmental agency, such as child and/or adult protective services, family or juvenile court; or 3. Accept proof of the completion of a medical evidentiary examination, such as medical reports, x-rays, medical photographs, as well as other clinical assessments as evidence of cooperation with law enforcement in cases involving sexual assault or abuse.. Modifications to the \"victim cooperation with law enforcement\" language are contained in the \"Program Requirements\" section of the Final Program Guidelines. II. Legislative Changes A. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-132). The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (Public Law I04-132) (hereinafter-\"The Antiterrorism Act\"), signed into law on April 24, 1996, contained a number of victim related provisions that amended VOCA. Listed below are three provisions that resulted in changes to the \"State Eligibility Criteria\" section of the Final Program Guidelines. 1. State Eligibility Criteria/Mandatory Coverage of Terrorism Victims in State Compensation Statutes. The Antiterrorism Act provides for a new VOCA-eligibility requirement that each state must include \"crimes involving terrorism\" in their definition of\"compensable crimes\". Thus, the state must offer compensation benefits to: a. Residents and non-residents who are injured or killed by a crime involving terrorism occurring within the state; b. Its own residents who are injured or killed in terrorist attacks occtaTing outside the United States or in a state that does not have an eligible crime victim compensation program. The law gives states until April 24, 1997 (Federal Fiscal Year 1998 grant application) to come into compliance with this new eligibility requirement for receiving federal VOCA compensation grants. 2. Means Testing. The Antiterron';m Act also prohibits any federal, state, or local government program that uses federal funds from including victim compensation benefits when determining income eligibility for an applicant, if the applicant needs such assistance (medical or otherwise), in full or in part, because of the commission of a crime against the applicant. 3. Prohibition Against Awards To Convicted Persons Owing Fines. The Antiterrorism Act prohibits states from awarding victim compensation benefits to any person convicted of a federal crime who is delinquent in paying a fine, monetary penalty, or restitution imposed for the offense. This provision, however, will not become effective until the U.S. Attorney General and the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts issue a written determination that the entities administering federal victim programs have access to accurate and efficient criminal debt payment information. As of this date, no such determination has been made, and states are under no obligation to investigate or make determinations on whether a victim owes a federal criminal debt before awarding compensation benefits. The Antiterrorism Act also resulted in three changes to the \"Availability of Funds\" section. 4. OVC Reserve Fund. The Anti-terrorism Act authorizes the OVC Director to establish a reserve fund, up to $50 million, from current year Crime Victims Fund (Fund) deposits which are in excess of 110 percent ofthe total amount deposited in the Fund during the preceding fiscal year.. Reserve fund monies may be used for supplemental grants to assist victims of terrorist acts or mass violence occurring within or outside the U.S. The OVC Director may ar'ard reserve funds to the following entities: a. States for providing compensation and assistance to their state residents, who, while outside of the borders of the United States, become victims of a terrorist act or mass violence. The beneficiaries, however, cannot be persons who are-already eligible fol compensation under the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterroris,-- Act of 1986. Individuals coverea under this Act include those who are taken . captive because of their relationship with the U.S. government as a member of the U.S. Civil Service, as ,,yell as other U.S. citizens, nationals, or resident aliens who are taken captive while rendering service to the U.S. similar to that of-,eiviI servants. Dependent family members of such persons also are covered under the Omnibus Diplomatic Security Act. b. States' eligible crime victim compensation and assistance programs for providing compensation and emergency relief for the benefit of victims of terrorist acts or mass violence occurring within the U.S.; and c. U.S. Attorney's Offices for use in coordination with state victim compensation and assistance efforts in I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I providing relief to victims of terrorist acts or mass violence occurring within the U.S. d. The Director of OVC may also award OVC reserve funds to eligible state compensation and assistance programs to offset fluctuation in the funds during years in which the Fund decreases and additional monies are needed to stabilize funding for state programs. 5. Unobligated Grant Funds. Beginning with FFY 1997 VOCA grants, funds not obligated by the end of the grant period, up to a maximum of $500,000, will be returned to the Fund, and not to the General Treasury, as was the practice in previous years. Returned funds in excess of $500,000 in a given year shall be returned to the Treasury. Once any portion of a state's grant is returned to the Fund, the funds must be redistributed according to the formula established by VOCA and the Final Program Guidelines. States are encouraged to closely monitor the expenditure of VOCA funds throughout the grant period to avoid returning unobligated balances at the end of the grant period. 6. Grant Period Extended. The Antiterrorism Act extended the VOCA victim compensation grant period from the year of award plus one, to the year of award, plus two. (Subsequent legislation further extended the grant period to the year of award, plus three.) B. Omnibus Appropriations Act of 1997. This legislation was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Clinton in September, 1996. This Act further extended the grant period to the year of award plus three. This change is effective for all FFY 1997 grants. The Final Program Guidelines clarify that funds are available for obligation beginning October 1 of the year of the award, through September 30 of the FFY three years later. For example, grants awarded in November, 1996 (FFY 5 1997) are available for obligation beginning October 1, 1996 through September 30, 2000. This modification is contained in the \"Availability of Funds\" section of the Final Program Guidelines. III. (~banges in Applicable Federal Regulations, A. Mandatory Enrollment in U.S. Treasury Department's Automated Clearing House (ACI-F) Vendor Express Program. In accordance with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, the U.S. Treasury Department revised its regulations regarding federal payments. The Final'Program Guidelines have been modified to require that, effective July 26, 1996, all federal payments to VOCA victim compensation grantees must be made via electronic funds transfer. States that are new award recipients, or those that have previously received funds in the form of a paper check from the U.S. Treasury, must enroll in the Treasury Department's ACH Vendor Express program before requesting any federal funds. This means that VOCA grantees can no longer receive drawdowns against their awards via paper check mailed from the Treasury. Grant recipients must enroll in ACH for Treasury to electronically transfer drawdowns directly to their banking institutions. States that are currently on the Letter of Credit Electronic Certification System (LOCES) will be automatically enrolled in ~H program. This modification is .included in the \"Application Process\" section of the Final Program Guidelines. B. Higher Audit Threshold. In response to suggestions made by many recipients of federal grant awards, including VOCA grant recipients, OMB Circular, A-133 was revised, raising the audit threshold to $300,000 for all organizations receiving federal grants. This means that those state compensation programs that expend $300,000 or more in federal funding within the state fiscal year must have an audit made in accordance with OMB Circular A-133, as amended. This rule is effective for all fiscal years that began on or after July l, 1996. Previously, states that received $100,000 or more in federal financial assistance in any fiscal year were required to have a single audit for that year. States and subrecipients receiving at least $25,000, but less than $100,000, in a fiscal year had the option of performing a single audit or an audit of the federal program, and state and local governments receiving less than $25,000 in any fiscal year were exempt from ~udit requirements. This modification is contained in the \"Financial Requirements\" section of the Final ?rogram Guidelines. ~,UIDELINES FOR CRIME ~OMPENSATION GRA2~S VICTIM ' Background n 1984, VOCA established the Crime Victims Fund Fund) in the U.S. Treasury and authorized the Fund o receive deposits ~om fines and penalties levied on :riminals convicted of federal crimes. This Fund )rovides the source of funding for carrying out all of he activities mandated by VOCA. )VC makes annual VOCA crime victim ~)mpensation grants from the Fund to eligible states. ['he primary purpose of these grants is to supplement ;tare efforts to provide financial assistance and eimbursement to crime victims throughout the Nation br costs associated with being a victim of a crime, md to encourage victim cooperation and participation n the criminal justice system. State crime victim ompensation programs may use VOCA :ompensation grant funds to pay for eligible expenses ~rovided by the state compensation statute except for )roperty damage and property losses. ~tates have the responsibility for establishing ~,uidelines and procedures for applying for crime \u00a2ictim compensation benefits which meet the minimal ;tatutory requirements outlined in VOCA and the equirements in these Final Program Guidelines. !I. Fundin~ Allocation and ApDlica~ign process ~,. Distribution of Crime Victim Fund. OVC ~dministers the deposits made into the Fund for )rograms and services, as specified in VOCA. The 6 amount of funds available for distribution each year is dependent upon the total deposits into the Fund in the preceding Federal Fiscal Year. The Federal Courts Administration Act of 1992 removed the cap on the Fund, beginning with FFY 1993 deposits. This Act also eliminated the need for periodic reauthorization of VOCA and the Fund. Thus, under current legislation, the Fund will continue to receive deposits. I e Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act o~ ' 994 provides that the deposits into the Fund are to be aistributed as follows: 1. The first $3,000,000 deposited in @.e Fund in each fiscal year is available to the Administrati,'e Office of United States Courts for adminL tratix, costs to carry out the functions of the judicial branch under Sections 3611 of Title 18, U.S. Code. 2. The next $10,000,000 deposited in the Fund in a particular fiscal year: a. 85% shall be available to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for grants under Section 4(d) of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act for improving the investigation and prosecution of child abuse caseS; o,c,,-. b. 15% shall be available to the Director of the Office for Victims of Crime for grants under Section 4(d) of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act for Assisting Native American Indian Tribes in developing, establishing, and operating programs to improve the investigation and prosecution of child abuse cases. 3. The remaining Fund deposits are distributed as follows: a. 48.5 percent is available for victim compensation grants; I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I b. 48.5 percent is available for victim assistance grants; c. Three percent is available for support of services to federal crime victims and for demonstration, training, and technical assistance grants to eligible crime victim programs. B. Availability of Funds. 1. VOCA Victim Compensation Grant Formula. The Director of OVCwill make an anwml grant to eligible state crime victim compensation programs equal to 40 percent of the amounts awarded by the state program to victims of crime from state sources of revenue during the fiscal year preceding the year of deposits in the Fund (two years prior to the grant year). Note: Amounts paid to compensate victims for property damage or property loss cannot be included in a state's certification for a VOCA victim compensation grant award. If the amount in the Fund is insufficient to award each state 40 percent of its prior year's compensation payout, Section 1403(a)(2) of VOCA provides that all states will be awarded the same reduced percentage of their prior year payout from the available funds. 2. Reserve Fund. As the result of the provisions in the Antiterrorism Act amending VOCA, the OVC Director is authorized to retain funds in a reserve fund, up to $50 million. The Director may utilize the reserve funds in order to: a. Award supplemental grants to assist victims of terrorist acts or mass violence outside or within the U.S. The OVC Director may grant reserve funds for such purposes tO the following entities: I) States for providing compensation and assistance to their state residents, who, while inside their state borders or outside of the borders 0fthe United States, become victims of a terrorist act or mass violence. The beneficiaries, however, cannot be persons who are already eligible for compensation under The Omnibus 7 Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986. Individuals covered under, the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986 include persons who are,taken captive because of their relationship with the U.S. Government as a member of the U.S. Civil Service, as well as other U.S. citizens, nationals, or resident aliens who are taken captive ~ dle rendering service to the U.S. sin.. \"at to that of civil servants. Dependent family members of such persons also are covered under the Omnibus Diplomatic Security Act. 2) States' eligible crime victim compensation and assistance programs for providing emergency relief, including crisis response efforts, training, and teehrdeal assistance for the benefit of victims of terrorist acts or mass violence occurring within the U.S. 3) U.S. Attorney's Offices for use in coordination with state victim compensation and assistance efforts in providing emergency relief to V~t~ns of terrorist acts or mass violence occurring within the U.S. b. Offset Fluctuations in Fund. The OVC director may also use the reserve fund to oft'set fluctuations in Fund deposits for state compensation and assistance programs in years in which the Fund decreases and additional monies are needed to stabilize programs. 3. Grant Period. Federal legislation passed in 1996 also makes victim compensation grant funds available for expenditure throughout the FFY of award as well as in the next three fiscal years. The FFY begins on October I and ends on September 30. State crime victim compensation programs may pay compensation claims retroactively from October 1, even though the VOCA grant may not be awarded until later in the grant period. 4. Grant Deobligations. Funds not obligated by the end of the grant period, up to a total of $500,000, will be returned to the Fund. Once any portion of a state's grant is returned to the Fund, the funds must be redistributed according to the rules established by VOCA and +he Final Program Guidelines, so states are enet raged to monitor closely the expenditure of VOC,,..eunds throughout the grant period. C. Administrative Costs 1. Purpose of Administrative Cost Allowance. Since FFY 1995, the VOCA has allowed up to five percent of crime victim compensation grant funds to be used for administering the state crime victim compensation grant program(s). It is in the state's discretion to use the allowable five percent for program administration. However, any part of the allowable five percent which is not used for administrative purposes must be used for awards of compensation to crime victims. The intent of this provision of VOCA is to support and advance program administration in all operational areas including claims processing , staff development and training, public outreach, and program funding by supporting those activities that will improve program effectiveness and service to crime victims. If a state elects to use up to five percent of their VOCA compensation grant for administrative purposes, only those costs directly associated with administering the program, enhancing overall program operations such as training and public outreach regarding eligiblity requirements and available benefits, and ensuring compliance with federal requirements, can be paid with limited administrative grant funds. Further, states must certify that VOCA funds used for administrative purposes will not be used to supplant state or local funds but will be used to increase the amount of state funds that are available for administering the compensation program. For 8 the purpose of establishing a baseline level of effort, states should maintain documentation as to the overall administrative commitment of the state prior to their use of VOCA administrative grant funds. 2. Allowable Costs. Allowable administrative costs include but are not limited to the following: program personnel, salary and benefits; travel costs for attendance at state, regional, and national compensation training conferences; computer equipment and support services; audit costs; costs involved in the production .and distribution of program brochures and posters, and other program outreach activities; professional fees for computer services and peei review of compensation claims; agency membership dues for victim compensation organizations; program enhancements such as toll-free numbers; special equipment and materials to facilitate service to persons with disabilities, and other reasonable costs directly related to administering a compensation program. The following activities impact the delivery and quality of compensation services to crime victims throughout the state and, thus, can be supported by administrative funds: a. Improving coordination efforts on behalf of crime victims with other O.]'P OffieC~\"-and Bureaus and with federal, state, and local agencies and organizations; b. Providing training on crime victim compensation program issues such as aplieation and eligibility requirements and range of compensable expenses, to state, public, and nonprofit organizations that serve or assist crime victims such as law enforcement officials, victim witness coordinators, corrections personnel, social service workers, victim service providers, and mental health and medical professionals; c. Purchasing, printing, and/or developing applications, brochures and other relevant publications such as training manuals which I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I i I I I I I I I I I describe the compensation application process, eligiblity criteria, and range of beneifts, available for crime victims; d. Developing protocols, policies, and procedures that promote coordination of victim compensation and victim assistance services and improve the ways crime victims arc treated and served; and 3. Salary Costs. Staffsupported by administrative funds under the VOCA crime victim compensation grant must work directly fo r. the compensation program in the same propc.i.'@n as their level of support from VOCA grant glads. If the staffhave other functions, the proportion of time working on the compensation program must be documented using some reasonable method at regular intervals such as time and attendance records on all Tunded staff which demonstrate the portion of staff time spent on compensation related activities. The documentation must provide a clear audit trail for the expenditure of grant funds. Only staff activities directly related to compensation functions can be funded With VOCA administrative funds. Similarly, any equipment purchases or other expenditures charged to the VOCA compensation grant should only be charged proportionate to the percentage of time utilized by the compensation program. Temporary or periodic personnel support, such as qualified peer reviewers for medical and mental health claims, and data processing support services are also allowable. These services may be obtained through contract using VOCA administrative funds. 4. Requirement to Notify OVC of Use of Administrative Funds. Those states that elect to utilize administrative funds under the VOCA compensation grant, arc required to include with their annual application the following information: a. The amount of the total grant that will be used for program administration; b. An itemization of the state's projected expenditures and a general description of the activities that will be supported; c. How these activities will improve the administration of the VOCA program and/or improve services to crin,.~ victims. A state may modify projections set forth in their application by providing 0VC a revised description of their planned use of administrative funds, writing, subsequent to submitting their annual ,pplication. However, the revised description must be reviewed prior to the obligation of any federal funds. Failure to notify OVC of modifications will prevent the state from meeting its obligation to reconcile its State-wide Report with its Final Financial Status Report. D. Application Process I. Application for Federal Assistance. Each year, OVC issues to each eligible state a Program Instruction and Application Kit, which contains the necessary forms and detailed information required to make application for VOCA crime victim compensation grant funds. The amount for which each state may apply is included in the Application Kit. States shall use the Standard Form 424, Application for Federal Assistance, and its attachments to apply for VOCA \"~fi'd'tim compensation grant funds. Applications for VOCA crime victim compensation grants may only be submitted by the state agency designated by the Governor to administer the VOCA grant. Completed applications must be submitted on or before the stated deadline, as determined by OVC. If an eligible state fails to apply for its crime victim compensation allocation by the prescribed deadline, OVC will redistribute federal VOCA crime victim compensation dollars to the VOCA victim assistance grant program as provided by Section 1404(a)(1) of VOCA (42 U.S.C. 10603 (a)(1)), assuming all states have received the statutofily prescribed 40% (percent) of their prior years payouts. 2. Required Attachments to Application. In addition to submission of the Application for Federal Assistance, states shall submit the following information: a. A description of their arrangements for complying with the audit provisions of Circular A-133, as amended. b. Certifications Regarding Lobbying, Debarment, suspension, and Other Responsibility Matters; Drug-Free Workplace eq.uirements; Civil Rights Compliance, and any other certifications required by OYP and OVC. Additionally, states must complete a disclosure form specifying any lobbying activities that arc conducted. c. Crime Victim Compensation Eligible State Payments Certification Form which is furnished by OVC. The amount certified on this Form is used by OVC to determine the annual federal grant award to each eligible state in the following year. This form must be completed and signed by the authorized individual within the agency designated by the Governor to administer the VOCA crime victims compensation grant. For further information concerning the state certification, see the Program Requirements section. d. An assurance that the program will comply with all applicable nondiscrimination requirements; e. An assurance that in the event a federal or \u00a2 state court or federal or state administrative agency makes a finding of discrimination after a due process hearing, on the grounds of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, or disability against the program, the program will forward a copy of the finding to the Office of Justice Programs, Office for Civil Rights (OCR); f. The name of the civil rights contact person who has lead responsibility for ensuring that all lo applicable civil rights requirements are met and who shall act as liaison in civil rights matters with OCR; g. An assurance that programs will maintain information on crime victims receiving services by race, national origin, sex, age, and disabilities, where sach information is voluntarily furnished by claimants. A state may; at its discretion, use the following language when soliciting claimant responses: \"The submission of information regarding race/ethnic background or disabilities is strictly voluntary. A decision to not supply this information will not affect your eligibility for compensation benefits informatioh. However, this information is important. We use it to study the extent to which members of minorities, and persons with disabilities are recipients of compensation benefits and to determine the extent to which outreach efforts should be enhanced to ensure access and services to these populations.\" h. A copy of the state statute authorizing the state's crime victim compensation program. 3. Enrollment in Automated Clearing House. In addition to yearly submission of the grant application and the above-mentioned information and assta~ces, states must be enrolled in the automated clearing house (ACH) so that the U.S. Dep .m~anent of Treasury can electronically transfer the VOCA victim compensation grant directly to the grantee's banking institution. States that are new award recipients, or those that have previously received funds in the form of a paper check fxom the U.S. Treasury, must enroll in the Treasury Department's ACH Vendor Express program before requesting any federal funds. This means that VOCA grantees can no longer receive drawdowns against their awards via paper check mailed from the Treasury. Grant recipients must enroll in ACH for Treasury to electronically transfer drawdowns directly to their banking \"institutions. States that are currenity on the Letter'of Credit Electrocic Certification System (LOCES) will be automatically enrolled in the ACH program. Enrollment in ACH need only be completed once. m i I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I i I I I I I I I I I I I I III. Program Requirements A. State ]Eli~bili~ Criteria. The fundamental criteria for eligibility is the grantee must be an operational state-administered crime victim compensation program. The term \"state\" includes the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands, and any other possession or territory of the United States. Although an authorized program that has not actually paid-out compensation benefit' would be technically eligible under Section 14(, Co)(1) of VOCA, the program would not be entitled t\u00a2 .l VOCA grant because it had not awarded any benefits that could be matched under Section 1403(a)(I). VOCA compensation grant funds may not be used as \"start- up\" funds for a new state program. Section 1403 of VOCA prescribes the conditions and eligibility criteria related to crime victim compensation grants. In order for a state to meet or mainta~ eligibility for a crime victims compensation grant, it must satisfy the following eligibility requirements: I. State Operated Compensation Program for Victims. The program must be operated by a state and offer compensation to victims and survivors of victims of \"compensable crimes,\" including crimes involving terrorism, drunk driving, and domestic violence. The Amendments to VOCA contained in the Antiterrorism Act of 1996 gives states until April 24, 1997 (FFY 1998 grant application) to come into compliance with the new eligibility conditions for receiving federal VOCA compensation grants. The term \"compensable crime\" means a crime, the victims of which are eligible for compensation under the state's eligible crime victim compensation program statute or rule. The range of expenses for which states may award crime victims compensation varies nationwide, although all states must award compensation for medical expenses, including mental health counseling and care; loss of wages; and funeral expenses. 11 2. Means Testing. The Antiterrorism Act prohibits any federal, state, or local government program that uses federal funds from including victim compensation benefits when determining income eligibility for an applicant, if the applicant needs such assistance (medical or otherwise), in full or in part, because of.the commission of a crime against the applicant. 3. Prohibition Against Awarding Compensation to Those Delinquent in Paying Federal Criminal Fines. The Antiterrorism Act prohibits states from awarding victim compensation benefits to any person convicted of a federal crime who is delinquent in paying a fine, monetary penalty, or restitution imposed for the offense. This provision, however,, will not become effective until the U.S. Attortiey General and the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts issue a written determination that ~ entities administering federally-funded victim compensation programs have access to accurate and efficient criminal debt payment tracking information. As of this date, no such determination has been made, and states are under no obligation to investigate or make determinations on whether a victim owes a federal criminal debt, before awarding compensation benefits. 4. Victim Cooperation with Law Enforcement. Encouraging victims to cooperate with law enforcement and to report the crime is important to the effective functioning of the criminal justice system and to preventing further victimization. Although state crime victim compensation programs maintain the authority and discretion to establish their own standards for \"reasonable cooperation,\" OVC encourages state compensation program staff to meet with victims and advocates to carefully review whether state statutes and state program guidelines and policies are responsive to the needs of crime victims and to determine possible barriers that might impede a victim's cooperation with law enforcement. Possible impediments include compelling health or safety reasons, such as apprehension regarding personal safety, fear of retaliation, and intimidation by the offender or others. For example, some victims may be reluctant to cooperate fully with law enforcement after receiving threats of violence or even death against themselves and their children from the offender. Age, psychological, cultural, or linguistic barriers may also influence the extent of victim cooperation with law enforcement. For instance, there may be special barriers deterring a young child or senior citizen from complying fi'll.y with law enforcement. Embarrassment and sh't-..ae may delay the reporting of sexual assault, and cultural and language differences may diminish a victim's access to the criminal justice system. In setting the standard for victim cooperation with law enforcement, the state program should determine how much weight to give to these considerations. VOCA's \"cooperation with the reasonable requests of law enforcement\" requirement may be fulfilled by utilizing the following criteria or any other criteria the state believes is necessary to encourage victim cooperation with law enforcement. For example, a state may: a. Require a victim to report the crime to a law enforcement agency; b. Require a victim to report the crime to an appropriate governmental agency, such as child and/or adult protective services, family court, or juvenile court; or c. Accept proof of the completion of a medical evidentiary examination, such as medical reports, x-rays, medical photographs, as well as other clinical assessments as evidence of cooperation with law enforcement in cases involving sexual assault or abuse. 5. Nonsupplaatation. The state must certify that grants received under this section will not be used 12 to supplant state funds otherwise available to provide crime victim compensation or to administer the state crime victim compensation program. The nonsupplantation provision is intended to assure that states use VOCA funds to augrnent~ not replace, otherwise avairable state funding for crime victim compensation. More specifically, the states may not decrease their financial commitment to crime victim compensation solely because they are receiving' )CA funds for the same purpose. . 6. Compensation for Residents Victimized Outside Their Own State. The \"state must provide compensation to residents of the state who are victims of crimes occurring outside the state, if the crimes would be compensable had they occurred inside that state; and .the crimes occurred in a state not having an eligible crime victim compensation program, or occurred outside the U.S. (If the compensable crime is terrorism as defined in Section 2331 of title 18 of the U.S. Code). The state must make these awards according to the same criteria used to make awards to those who are victimized while in the state. This provision is intended to cover those residents of a state who are victimized in a state whiefrifoes not have an eligible crime victims compensation program for which the victim qualifies. In such instances, the victim would be eligible to apply for crime victim compensation from the State in which he or she resides. 7. Compensation for Non-residents of a State. The state must make compensation awards to victims who are non-residents of the state according to the same criteria used to make awards to victims who are residents of such state. Eligibility for VOCA funds requires the state program to extend itscoverage to all non-residents victimized in the state. Note: For the purposes of this provision, the term \"non-resident\" must, at a minimum, include anyone who is a resident in one I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I II I I II I I I I I I state but victimized in another. A state may, at its discretion, broaden its definition of non-resident to include anyone victimized in the state regardless of whether the victim is a United States resident. This provision is intended to ensure that non- residents of a state, who are victimized in a state that has an eligible compensation program, are provided the opportunity to apply for and receive the same compensation benefits that are available to residen of the state. The provision of reciprocal a,. ,rements with certain other states will not suffice to meet these criteria. .%. 8. Victims of Federal Crime. The state must provide compensation to victims of federal crimes occurring within the state on the same basis that such program provides compensation to victims of state crimes. For example, a victim of a rape, occurring on a federal installation or Indian reservation inside the state, must be afforded the same benefits that would be available to the victim if the rape were classified as a crime against the state. This provision is intended to cover those individuals victimized on military installations, national parks and highways, Native American reservations; and under other circumstances where Federal jurisdiction exists since there is no federal compensation program which provides benefits to victims covered under federal jurisdiction. 9. Unjust Enrichment. Except pursuant to rules issued by the compensation program to prevent unjust enrichment of the offender, the state cannot deny compensation to any victim because of that victim's familial relationship to the offender, or because of the sharing of a residence by the victim and the offender. Unjust enrichment, as the basis for denying crime victims compensation, must be based upon written rules issued by the state crime victims compensation program. \"Rules\" mean either written policies or directives developed and distributed by state crime victim compensation programs or rules adopted by legislative or 13 administrative bodies. Such rules cannot have the effect of denying compensation to a substantial percentage of domestic violence victims. The rules relating to unjust enrichment should be applicable to all claims for compensation although it is recognized that domestic violence eases have the greatest potential for unjust enrichment. In general, programs must balance the goals of making compensation benefits available to victims and preventing unjust enrichment of offenders. State programs are strongly encouraged to work with domestic violence coalitions and repres~.nt~tives to this end. In developing rules, the states are encouraged :o consider the foIlo .wing: a. Legal responsibilities of the offender to the victim under the laws of the state and collateral resources available to the victim from the offender. For example, legal responsibilities may include court-ordered restitution or requirements for spouse and/or family support under the domestic or marital property laws of the state. Collateral resources may include insurance or pension benefits available to the offender to cover the costs incurred by the victim as a result of the crime. However, as with other crimes, vic~tuns of domestic violence should not be penalized when collateral sources of payment are not viable, e.g., when the offender refuses to, or cannot, pay restitution or other civil judgments within a reasonable period of time or when the offender otherwise impedes direct or third party (i.e., insurance) payments. b. Payments to victims of domestic violence which benefit offenders in only a minimal or inconsequential manner would not be considered unjust enrichment. To deny payments, in some instances, could serve to further victimize the claimant. For example, denial of medical or dental expenses solely because the offender has legal responsibility for the charges, but is unwilling, or unable to pay them, could result in the victim's inability to receive treatment. c. Consultation with social services and other concerned governmental entities, as well as with private organizations that support and advocate on behalf of domestic violence victims. d. The special needs of child victims of criminal violence especially when the perpetrator was the parent who may or may not have lived in the same residence. 10. Other Information Requested by the OVC Director. The state must provide such other information and assurances as the Director of OVC may reasonably require. II. Payor of Last Resort. When a victim is eligible to receive benefits from a federal program or federally financed state or local program, such as Medicaid, the state compensation program shall not pay the costs that the federal or federally financed programs covers. Additionally, the federal or federally financed program shall make its payments without regard to the existence of the crime victim compensation program. The compensation program is the payor of last resort with regard to federal or federally financed programs. OVC encourages state grantees to coordinate their VOCA assistance and compensation activities to ensure a continuum of services for crime victims. Coordination may include activities such as: planning meetings; training activities for direct service providers on the general parameters of the state compensation agency's program (e.g., eligibility criteria, completion of claims, and time frames for receiving compensation); providing information on VOCA-funded victim assistance services within the state; and developing joint guidance, where applicable, on third-party payments to VOCA assistance organizations. OVC also requires state grantees to coordinate their activities with the Victim/Witness Coordinator staff within U.S. Attorney Offices to ensure that the Coordinators are aware of available resources for victims of federal crime. B. State Certifications. Guidelines on amotmts to be included as well as amounts to be excluded in a state's certification of payments of crime victims compensation from state funding sources are furnished below: 1. Program Revenue. States must report on the ertification form all sources of state revenue . \"ailable to the crime victi/ns compensation program during the Federal Fiscal Year. In some instances, funds are made available to the crime victims compensation program from other departments or agencies, from supplemental appropriations, donations, or unspent funds carried over from prior years. All state funds which are available during the Federal Fiscal Year should be reported. The amount of certified revenue, excluding VOCA funds, but including all other sources, including carried over funds, must meet or exceed the amount of certified payments to crime victims. 2. Amounts to Be Included. Thetotal amount to be certified by the state program must include only those amounts paid from state funding sources to or on behalf of crime victims during the Federal Fiscal Year (October I to September,0). 3. Compensable Expenses. The range of expenses for which states may award crime victims compensation varies nationwide, although all states must award compensation for medical expenses, including mental health counseling and care; loss of wages; and funeral expenses. Note: The term \"medical expenses\" includes, to the extent provided under the state crime victim compensation program statute, expenses for eyeglasses and other corrective lenses; dental services, devices, and prosthetic devices; and for services rendered in accordance with a method of healing recognized by the law of the state. \"Mental health counseling and care\" means the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of an individuars mental and emotional functioning that 14 I ! I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I is required to alleviate psychological trauma resulting from a compensable crime. \"Such intervention must be provided by a person who meets such standards as may be set by the state for victim mental health counseling and care. Compensable expenses to be included in the annual certification must be authorized by State statute or rule, providing there is rule making authority in state law. States may include expenses, not specifically identified in VOCA, such as pain and suffering; crime scene clean up; replacement costs for clothing and bedding held as evidence; annuities for child victims for loss of support; medically-necessary building modification; medically-necessary devices; and attorney fees related to a victim's claim for compensation. States may also include payments related to forensic sexual assault examinations, even if the victim did not report the crime to law enforcement if such payments are made from funds administered by the compensation program and are allowable under the state's statute or administrative rules. 4. Amounts to Be Excluded. States must exclude, in the certification, VOCA grant funds, compensation for property losses or property damage, audit costs, personnel costs, and any other program administrative costs. 5. Applicable Credits. Any \"applicable credits\" must be deducted from the state certification. The term \"applicable credits\" refers to those receipts or reduction of expenditures, which offset or reduce expense items that are allocable to a particular crime victim compensation claim. Typical examples of applicable credits in state crime victims compensation programs include funds received through a state's subrogation interest in a claimant's civil law suit recovery, restitution, refunds, or other reimbursements. Refunds include amounts from overpayment, erroneous payments made to claimants, uneashed cheeks, etc. Additional guidance regarding applicable credits can be found in OMB Circular A-87, \"Cost Principles for State and Local Governments.\" States must determine how to account for both the receipt and expenditure of restitution and refunds. Note: A state is not required to reduce its certified payment figme by the amount of restitution recoveries received by the state which are not directly related to the payment of crime victim compensation benefits, \"nor when such reimbursements were from payments to victims prior to receiving a VOCA award. 6. Recovery Costs. Salary costs fc-personnel directly involved in recovery efforts Which are directly attributable to the recovery of\" stitution, refunds, and other reimbursements, may be offset against the amount of income received from such reimbursement. Expenses shall be limited to the percentage of those salaries incurred by the state for employees whose primary responsibilities (not less than 75 percent of their tina.e) are directly and specifically related to recovering restitution and other reimbursements. Recovery costs can not be claimed for employees whose salary is derived from federal administrative grant funds. 7. Source of Payments to CHine Victims. There is no financial requirement that state compensation programs identify the source of individual payments to crime victims as either federal or state dollars, nor is there any requirement that restitution recoveries or other refunds be tracked to federal or state doLla~s\u00b0p\"~d out to the victim. C. Incorrect Certifications. If it is determined that a state has made an incorrect certification of payments of crime victims compensation from state funding sources and a VOCA crime victim compensation grant is awarded in error, one of the following two courses of action will be taken: 1. Over Certification. In the event that an over certification comes to the attention of OVC or the Office of the Comptroller, OJP, the necessary steps will be taken to recover funds which were awarded in error. OVC does not have the authority to permit states to keep amounts they were not entitled to as a result ofovercertification. I 15 2. Under Certification. If a state under-certifies amounts paid to crime victims, OVC will not supplement payments to the state in a subsequent year to correct the state's error. Once OVC awards funds in a given PFY, there are no excess funds available to remedy errors of this nature. D. Program Reporting Requirements. Annual Performance Report. States receiving VOCA crime victims compensation grant funds are required to submit\" an Annual Performance Report that is provided by OVC. The Report I quests specific information about claims for compe. \"ation, such as types of crimes compensated, including terrorism, drunk driving and domestic violence, disposition of claims, payments for compensable expenses, and use of administrative and training funds. The Performance Report covers the Federal Fiscal Year ending September 30 and is due to OVC by December 30 of the same year. E. Additional Requirements 1. Civil Rights - Prohibition of Discrimination for Recipients of Federal Funds. No person in any state shall, on the grounds of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, or disability be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be subjected to discrimination under, or denied employment in connection with any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance, pursuant to the following statutes and regulations: Section 809(c), Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 3789d, and Department of Justice Nondiscrimination Regulations, 28 CFR Part 42, Subparts C, D, E, and G; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2000d, ete, Lqlt.; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 794; Subtitle A, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 12101, et e,~q.; and Department of Justice regulations on disability discrimination, 28 CFR Part 35 and Part 39; Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended, 20 U.S.C. 1681-1683; and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6101, et eLe__q. 2. Confidentiality of Research Information. Except as otherwise provided by law, no recipient of monies under VOCA shall use or reveal any research or statistical information gathered under this program by any person, and identifiable to any specific private person, for any purpose other than the purpose for which such information was obtained, in accordance with VOCA. Such information, and any copy of such information, shall be immune from legal process and shall not, without the consent of the person fma'6shing such information, be admitted as evidence or used for any purpose i.r. any action, suit; or other judicial, legislative, ,.. *,iministrative proceeding. [See Section 1407(d) of VOCA, codified at 42 U.S.C. 10604(d)]. This provision is intended, among other things, to assure the confidentiality of information provided by crime victims to employees of VOCA-funded victim compensation programs. However, there is nothing in VOCA or its legislative history to indicate that Congress intended to override o, repeal, in effect, a state's existing law governing the disclosure of information, which is supportive of VOCA's fundamental goal of helping crime victims. For example, this provision would not act to override or repeal, in effect, a state's existing law pertaining to the mandatory reporting of a suspected child abuse. See permhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman. et al., 4~,2d.S. 1 (1981). ~IV, Financial Requirements As a condition of receiving a grant, states agree to insure adherence to the general and specific requirements as set forth in the \"O.rP Financial Guide\" and applicable OMB Circulars and Common Rules. This includes the maintenance of books and records in accordance with generally accepted government accounting principles. States further agree to identify their state fiscal year and federal cognizant audit agency. This section describes the payment of grant funds, termination of advanced funding; financial status reports, and audit requirements. 16 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I i A. I I I I I I I I I I I Audit Responsibilities for States. State compensation programs that expend $300,000 or more in federal financial assistance within the state's fiscal year are required to have an audit in accordance with OMB Circular A-133, as amended. State and local governments expending less than $300,000 in their fiscal year are exempt from audit requirements. This rule is effective for all fiscal years that began on or after July 1, 1996. B. Audit Costs. Although under OMB Circular A- 133 audit costs are generally allowable charges under federal grants, audit costs incurred at the grantee level are determined to be an administrative expense and may be paid with the allowable five percent for administration. Any of the VOCA grant monies used for administrative purposes cannot be included in the state-certified payout. C. Financial Status Report for States. Financial Status Reports (269A) are required from all state agencies. A Financial Status Report shall be submitted to the Office of the Comptroller for each calendar quarter in which the grant is active. This Report is due even when no obligations or expenditures were incurred during the reporting period. Financial Status Reports shall be submitted to the Office of the Comptroller, by the state, within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter. Calendar quarters end March 3 I, June 30, September 30, and December 31. A Final Financial Status Report is due 120 days after the end of the VOCA grant, no later than January 31. I I I I I cash are made disbursements. D. Termination of Advance Funding. If the state grantee receiving cash advances by direct Treasury deposit demonstrates an unwillingness or inability to establish procedures that will minimize the time elapsing between cash advances and disbursements, OJP may terminate advance funding and require the state to finance its operations with its own working capital. Payments to the state will then be made to the state by the ACH Vendor Express method to reimburse the grantee for actual cash disbursements. It is essential that the grantee organization maintain a minimum of cash on hand and that drawdowns of only when necessary for I V. Mgnitorin,, A. Office of the Comptroller~General Accounting Office/Office of the Inspector General. The Office of the Comptroller, the General Accounting Office, and the Office of the Inspector General conduct periodic reviews of the financial policies and procedures and records of VOCA state grantees. Therefore, upon request, states must give authorized representatives the right to access and examine all records, bool , papers, ease files, or other documents related to the, \"ant. B, Office for Victims of Crime. OVC Conducts on- site monitoring in which each state grantee is visited a minimum of once every three years. While on site, OVC personnel will review various documents and files such as (1) financial and program manuals and procedures governing the crime victim compensation grant program; (2) financial records, reports, and audit reports for the state grantee; (3) the state's compensation application, procedures, and guidelines for awarding compensation benefits; (4) a random sampling of victim compensation claim files; and (5) all other applicable state records and files. .VI. Suspension and Termination of Funding_ if, after notice to the grantee, OVC finds that a state has failed to comply substantially with VOC/X~.Ote OJ'P Financial Quide (effective edition), the Final Program Guidelines, or any implementing regulation or requirement, OVC may suspend or terminate funding to the state and/or take other appropriate action. Under the procedures of 28 CFR Part 18 (7-l- 96-Edition), states may request a hearing on the justification for the suspension and/or termination of VOCA funds. 1\"/ I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 7 th Indian Nations Conference Alternative Justice in Indian Country: Indigenous Restorative Principles Lead the Way to a More MeaningfulApproach to Handling Victim Cases Ada Pecos Melton Tulsa, Oklahoma 1999 II I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I il I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 7 th Indian Nations Conference \"Alternative Justice in Indian Country: Indigenous Restorative Justice Principles Lead the Way to a More Meaningful Approach to Handling Victim Cases\" Ada Pecos Melton Learning Objectives: 1.

I Indian Nation Juvenile Justice Systems I I I I I I I I I I I I by Ada Pecos Melton and Elizabeth Bird Background Due to the unique government-to-government relationship the United States has with Indian Nations, the Federal government and its agencies have an important role to play in assisting Indian Nations to address youth crime, violence, and victimization in their communities. In response to the rise in American Indian juvenile crime, violence, and victimization, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) funded four Indian Nations between fiscal years (FY's) 1992 and 1995 to develop culturally relevant community-based programs to address the needs of young Indian offenders and their families. Additionally, OJJDP funded a technical assistance program to assist Indian Nations in the design, development, and implementation of such programs. The experience of this initiative has provided OJJDP with insight into the needs and problems that Indian governments and communities face in dealing with juvenile delinquency, violence, and victimization. Purpose The success of this initiative resulted in an expansion of technical assistance by OJJDP in FY 1996. As a result, OJJDP funded a 3-year training and technical assistance program seeking to increase the capacity of Indian Nations to provide adequate and appropriate juvenile justice responses to youth crime, violence, and victimization. The goal of this ongoing technical assistance program is to help exlui p Indian Nation governments with the necessary information and tools to develop or enhance compre- hensive, systemwide approaches to reduce juvenile delinquency, violence, and victimization and increase the safety of their communities. American Indian Development Associates In FY 1997, American Indian Development Associates (AIDA) was awarded a 3-year cooperative agreement to provide training and technical assistance to American Indian and Alaskan Native governments to develop or enhance their juvenile justice systems. Under the cooperative agreement, AIDA is working to develop a more comprehensive approach to address juvenile delinquency, violence, and victimization in Indian communities. AIDA delivers training and technical assistance in the context of the complex and varying relationships that Indian Nations have with local and State governments and the Federal govern- ment. Equipped with this understanding, AIDA provides training and technical assistance that supports a cooperative and collaborative approach by each of these levels of govern- ment to address the needs of Indian youth and their families. AIDA provides assistance at the request of Indian Nation governments and agencies that serve Indian Nations and Indian youth and families. Once technical assistance requests are categorized, reviewed, and approved, AIDA develops a compre- hensive training and technical assistance delivery plan. A primary goal of all training and technical assistance is to aid communities in developing culturally appropriate and effective ways of dealing with problems faced by Indian youth and their families. Technical assistance is delivered through onsite visits, telephone consultations, and regional training seminars. Technical assistance has included: Juvenile justice and detention needs assessments and program reviews. Seminars on comprehensive juvenile justice planning. Policy and procedure development for coordinated service delivery and referral systems. Development of community-based alternatives to incarceration. Training on indigenous justice approaches and processes to handle juvenile delinquency cases. Training on qualitative data collection and analysis to obtain community perspectives on juvenile delinquency, violence, and victimization. Training and competency development of juvenile justice practitioners, administrators, and tribal leaders in juvenile justice management and probation systems.

I I I I I I I I I I I I I OVERVIEW OF JUSTICE ISSUES FOR INDIAN PEOPLE J ustice issues for Indian Nations are based in. the struggle to find a balance between the demands of the Federal government and the needs of the community. The demands of the Federal government fall into two categories: Federal standards of justice and Federal funding of Indian government including judicial programs. The needs of Indian Nations are threefold: financing for Indian programs, providing for systems that ensure justice and resolve conflict, and ensuring that the Indian customary or traditional mores and values are included in the administration of justice. As one can see, there is a great deal of opportunity for conflict and contradiction for Indian Nations as they wrestle with the administration of justice in their communities. Culturally there are a number of issues that arise in the administration of justice. Indian Nations were relatively free to administer justice within the mores and values of the Indian culture prior to 1968. With a series of Supreme Court cases indicating that the provisions of the U.S. Bill of Rights do not apply to Indian governments and courts, Indian Nations could use traditional dispute resolution processes and handle criminal cases under traditional or customary law. But in 1968, Congress passed the Indian Civil Rights Act (ICRA), 25 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1301-13032 (1968, Suppl. 1986), which made certain provisions of the U.S. Bill of Rights applicable to Indian court proceedings. As a result, there were many concerns that the imposition of American standards of due process and other judicial notions would place traditional Indian jurisprudence in jeopardy. The ICRA amended P.L. 83-280, in that it required states to obtain tribal consent before assuming jurisdiction over Indians in Indian Country. As a result of the ICRA, cases such as In re Gault in which juvenile delinquents were entitled to many of the same rights as adult defendants must be filtered through the ICRA to be applicable in tribal settings. For the Pueblos of New Mexico, for example, ICRA represented a major threat to the traditional Indian court. Concerns were that certain aspects of the ICRA, especially the clauses relating to religion, jury trials, and right to counsel would cause a disruption in the centuries old methods of maintaining community harmony. Additionally, aspects of the statutory law that have been refined through decades of court decisions also posed a threat to traditional justice systems. Due process and equal protection are concepts that have been defined by the American court system. Important questions arise, such as does the ICRA include the various interpretations that the federal courts have concluded or are the Indian Nations free to apply Indian traditional law to develop their own definitions of the provisions in the ICRA? Examples would include the application of what constitutes due process in an Indian Nation court and a federal or state court. These issues were very threatening to the Indian Nations who have strong traditional bases for C\u00a2)1q99 American Indian l~eve.lcmment A.~.~ne.iate.~ the administration of justice that are drastically different from the those that govern state and federal courts. In recent years, Indian Nations have been increasingly concerned with the rising number of violent crimes resulting in some type of victimization occurring in their communities. Violent crimes range from misdemeanor assault and battery, to serious criminal and delinquent offenses such as domestic violence, child abuse, aggravated assault and gang-related offenses; t 2 violent felony crimes such as assault with a deadly weapon, drive-by shootings, sexual assaults, child sexual abuse, and homicides. While all the problems and issues victims face have not been clearly identified or examined there are many indicators that validate the concerns of Indian Nation governments. A 1999 report on American Indians and Crime prepared by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) provide the following insights into victimization experienced by American Indians. The BJS data was derived from American Indian households throughout the U.S. in urban, rural, reservation and off-reservation settings. > Although American Indians and Alaska Natives represent less than one percent (2.3 million) of the U.S. population, American Indians are victimized by violent crime at a rate more than twice that of the general U.S. population. > At least 70% of violence experienced by American Indians is committed by persons not of the same race, a substantially higher rate of interracial violence than experienced by white or black victims. > Violence against Indian women is particularly severe in that it is nearly 50% higher than that reported by black males. American Indians suffered seven rapes or sexual assaults per 1,000 compared to three per 1,000 among blacks two per 1,000 among whites, and one per 1,000 among Asians. ~' Nearly a third of all American Indian crime victims were between the ages of 18 and 24 years old. This group experienced the highest per capita rate of violence by any racial group. ~, In 55% of violent crimes against American Indians, the victims reported the offender was under the influence of alcohol, drugs or both. The arrest rate among American Indians for alcohol related offenses in 1996 was more than double of that among all races. An estimated 63,000 American Indians, about four percent age 18 or older are under the care, custody or control of the criminal justice system on an average day. At the end of 1996, about 16,000 American Indians were held in local jails, a rate of 1,083 per 100,000 adults, the highest of any racial group. Over 65% of the youth in Federal custody are Indian youth. The above data provides an understanding of the magnitude of crime victimization problems faced by Indian people of all ages. Many Indian Nations are limited in resources to adequately respond to the problems and to identify the gaps in services to victims, and bow to effectively ('~|gCy:J Amerle~n Indian F)evelnnment A.~n~.i~te.q 2 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I hold offenders accountable for their actions and obligations to victims and the community. Victims of crime, and often their families and friends, undergo a traumatic experience and disruption in their lives as a result of the crime inflicted upon them. Sometimes the trauma is exacerbated by the way they are treated by the tribal police and tribal justice system, which may appear to victims to be uncaring, insensitive institutions that have no interest in addressing their need for redress and safety and ensuring their rights. Important aspects of victim empowerment are for victims to be in control of their healing and for tribal institutions, such as tribal fourts to be visibly and affirmatively engaged in addressing victim issues and needs. 1 c~q American IndiAn Develnnment A.~.~nci~te.~ 3 m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m I I \":'S\"'\" :\";'\"'\" :\"\" \"\" \":\".\" ~. --\" ~. I Indigenous justice systems and tribal society Indigenous justice systems are based on a holistic philosophy. Law is a way of life, and justice is a part of the life process. by Ada Pecos Melton 'l I I I I I I n many contemporary tribal communities, dual justice sys- tems exist. One is based on what can be called an American para- digm of justice, and the other is based on what can be called an indigenous paradigm. The American paradigm has its roots in the world view of Europeans and is based on a retributive philoso- phy that is hierarchical, adversarial, punitive, and guided by codified laws and written rules, procedures, and guidelines.' The vertical power struc- ture is upward, with decision making limited to a few. The retributive phi- losophy holds that because the victim has suffered, the criminal should suf- fer as well. It is premised on the notion that criminals are wicked people who are responsible for their actions and deserve to be punished.\" Punishment I I ADA PECOS MELTON is director of the American Indian and Alaskan Naive Desk at the Office of Justice Programs.

In the American paradigm, the law is applied through an adversarial sys- tem that places two differing parties in the courtroom to determine a defendant's guilt or innocence, or to declare the winner or loser in a civil case. It focuses on one aspect of a problem, the act involved, which is dis- cussed through adversarial fact finding. The court provides the forum for testing the evidence presented from the differing perspectives and objectives of the parties. Interaction between parties is minimized and i'e- mains hostile throughout. In criminal cases, punitive sanctions limit account- ability of the offender to the state, in- stead of to those he or she has harmed or to the community.

These systems are guided by the unwritten customary laws, traditions, and practices that are learned primarily by example and through the oral teachings of tribal el- ders. s The holistic philosophy is a circle of justice that connects everyone involved with a problem or conflict on a continuum, with everyone focused on the same center.

In October 1995, the Snohomish County (Washington) Superior Court sentenced Guthrie and a robbery accomplice to prison after the two spent a year banished to the Alaska wilderness by a tribal court. Restorative principles refer to the mending process for renewal of dam- aged personal and communal relation- ships. The victim is the focal point, and the goal is to heal and renew the victim's physical, emotional, mental. and spiritual well-being It also in- volves deliberate acts by the offender to regain dignity and trust, and to re- turn to a heahhy physical, emotional. tnen~l, and spiritt,al state These are necessary for the offender and victvm t<~ save face and to restore personal and communal harmony. Reparative principles refer to the process +ff making things right f,, ,~ne- self arid tho~e affected bv the of- fender's behavior. To repair relation- ships, it is essential for the offender to make amends through apolog'],,', asking forgiveness, making restitution, and engaging in acts that demonstrate a sincerity to make things right. The communal aspect allows for crime to be viewed as a natural human error that requires corrective intervention by families and elders or tribal leaders. Thus, offenders remain an integral part of the cornmtmity because of their important role in defining the bound- aries of appropriate and inappropriate behavior and the consequences associ- ated with misconduct.

Law as a way of life The concept of law as a way of life makes law a living concept that one comes to know and understand oh rough experience. Law, as life, is linked to the elaborate relationships in many tribal communities. In some tribes it is exemplified by tribal divi- sions that represent legal systems pre- scribing the individual and kin rela- tionships of members and the responsibilities individual and group members have to one another and to the community? For example, in sev- eral Pueblo tribes, one is born into one of two moieties, or tribal divisions, decided by patrilineal lines. A woman can change membership only through marriage, when she joins her hus- band's moiety. Males generally cannot change their moiety, unless it is done during childhood through adoption or if their mother remarries into the opposite moiety. This illustrates how tribal law becomes a way of life that is set in motion at birth, and continues through an individual's life and death. The indigenous approach requires problems to be handled in their en- tirety. Conflicts are not fragmented, nor is the process compartmentalized into pre-adjudication, pretrial, adjudi- cation, and sentencing stages. These hinder the resoludon process for vic- tims and offenders and delay the resto- ration of relationships and communal harmony. All contributing factors are examined to address the underlying is- sues that precipitated the problem, and everyone affected by a problem participates in the process. This dis- tributive aspect generalizes individual misconduct or criminal behavior to the offender's wider kin group, hence there is a wider sharing of blame and guilt. The offender, along with his or her kinsmen, are held accountable and responsible for correcting behav- ior and repairing relationships. ~ Indigenous systems today The status of tribes as sovereign na- tions are both preconstitutional and extraconsdtutional.

Tribes have personal ju- risdiction over their members and non-member Indians, territorial juris- diction over their lands, and subject- matter jurisdiction over such area~ a.s criminal, juvenile, and civil matters. While limited by the Indian Civil Rights Act in sentencing? tribes have concurrent jurisdiction over the fel- ony crimes enumerated under the Ma- jor Crimes Act. t\u00b0 The forums .fo~. handling disputes differ for each tribe, which may use varying combinations of family and community forums, traditional courts, quasi-modern courts, and modern tribal courts. Family forums, such as family gath- erings and talking circles, are facili- tated by family elders or community leaders. Matters usually involve family problems, marital conflicts, juvenile misconduct, violent or abusive behav- ior, parental misconduct, or property disputes. Customary laws, sanctions, and practices are used. Individuals are summoned to these gatherings follow- ing traditional protocols initiated by the chosen elder. For example, in Pueblo communities the gathering is convened by the aggrieved person's family, which must personally notify the accused and his or her family of the time and place of the gathering. Generally, elders are selected as spokesperson~ responsible for open- ing and closing the meetings with prayers. During the meeting, each side has an opportunity to speak. The vic- tim may speak on his or her own be- half, and the family may assist in con- veying the victim's issues. Extended family members often serve as spokes- persons if the victim is very young or vulnerable. Similarly, a spokesperson may be designated to speak on behalf of the accused, especially if the ac- cused is a juvenile or if other circum- stances prevent the accused from speaking. When the family forum can- not resolve a conflict, the matter may be pursued elsewhere. Offender com- pliance is obligatory and monitored by the Families involved. It is discretion- ary for decisions and agreements to be recorded by the family. Community forums require more formal protocols than family forums, but draw on the families' willingness to Volume 79, Number 3 Judicature 129 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I i I I i I I I I I I I I I I I i discuss the issues, events, or accusa- tions. These are mediated by tribal of- fie-ials or representatives. Some tribes have citizen boards that serve as peace makers or facilitators. Customary laws, sa.nctions, and practices are used. Per- sonai notice is made by tribal represen- ta.fices to the individuals and families involved. Usually, this is all that is nec- essary to compel individuals to meet in both the family and community fo- rums. When necessary, a personal es- cort to the gathering place may be pro- vialed by tribal officials. In some tribal communities notice may be by' mall. In the community fo- rum, the tribal representa- tive acts as facilitator and participates in the resolu- tion process along with the offender and victim and their families. As with the family forum, prayers are said at the beginning and at closure. An unresolved matter may be taken to the next level, however, but tribes may or may not offer an appeal process for the community forum. In the Navajo peacemaker sys- tem, formal charges in the Navajo dis- trict court may be filed. In some Pueblo communities, matters may be pursued through the traditional court. Offender compliance is obligatory and monitored by the families in- voiced and tribal officials. Traditional courts incorporate some modern judicial practices to handle criminal, civil, traffic, andjucenile mab ters, but the process is similar to com- munity forums. These courts exist in tribal communities that have retained an indigenous government structure, such as the Southwest Pueblos. Matters are initiated through written criminal or civil complaints or petitions. Defen- dants are often accompanied by rela- tives to the hearings. Generally, anyone with a legitimate interest in the case is allowed to participate from arraign- ment through sentencing. Heads of tribal government preside and are guided by customary laws and sanc- tions. In some cases written criminal codes with prescribed sanctions may be used. Offender compliance is man- da.ted and monitored by the tribal offi- 150 Judicature Volume 79, Number3 dais with assistance from the families. Noncompliance by offenders may re- sult in more punitive sanctions such as arrest and confinement. Defendants are notified in writing. Ahhough rare, matters may be ap- pealed to the tribal council. In some tribes where a dual system exists, inter- action between the modern American court and traditional court are prohib- ited. That is, one may not pursue a matter in both lower-lecel courts. How- ever, an appeal from either court may be heard by the tribal council, which The indigenous approach\" to justice requires problems to be handled in their entirety. serves as the appellate court. Gener- ally, these courts record proceedings and issue written judgment orders. Quasi-modern tribal courts are based on the Anglo-American legal model. These courts handle criminal, civil, traffic, domestic relations, and ju- venile matters. Written codes, rules, procedures, and guidelines are used, and lay judges preside. Some tribes limit the types of cases handled by these courts. For instance, land dis- putes are handled in several Pueblo communities by family and commu- nity forums. Like traditional courts, noncompliance by offenders may re- sult in more punitive sanctions such as arrest and confinement. These are courts of record, and appellate systems are in place. Modern tribal courts mirror Ameri- can courts. They handle criminal, civil, traffic, domestic relations, andjucenile matters and are guided by written codes, rules, procedures, and guide- lines. They are presided over by law- trained judges and often exist in tribal communities that have a constitutional government. Like traditional courts and quasi-modern tribal courts, non- Novembtr-December 1995 compliance by offender's may result in more punitive sanctions such as arrest and confinement. Like qvasi-modern tribal courts, these are courts of rec- ord, and appellate systems are in place. Some of the quasi-modern and mod- ern courts incorporate indigenous jus- tice methods as an alternative resolu- tion process for jucenile delinquency, child custody, victim-offender cases, and civil matters. The trend of tribal courts is to use the fa~nily and commu- nity forums for matters that are highly interpersonal, either as a diversion al- ternative, as part of sen- ' ' tenting, or for victim-of- fender mediation. Some are court-annexed pro- grams such as the Aherna- fives For First Time Youth Offenders Program spon- sored by the Laguna Pueblo tribal court in New Mexico. Under this pro- gram, juvenile offenders are referred to the village officers, who convene a , community forum. Rec- ommendations for resolv- ing the matter may be court-ordered, or the resolution may be handled in- formally by the the village officers. This joint effort by the court and vil- lage officers allows them to address the problem at the local village level and to intervene early to prevent further delinquency. Characteristics of indigenous law Common terms or references to the law of indigenous societies include customary law, indigenous law, native law, and tribal or native law ways. All refer to the same concept. Customary law is generally derived from custom. Custom in this sense means a long-established practice that has acquired the force of law by com- mon adoption or acquiescence; it does not vary. n Tribal common law is based on the values, mores, and norms of a tribe and expressed in its customs, tradi- tions, and practices. In some tribes, the tribal common law has been set ! 1. Zuni. \"Justice Based on Indigenous Con- ccpu.\" Paper prcscnted at the IndigenousJuslicc Conference: Justice Based on Indian Concepts. ..- _:<. ,.. ~.:~ \",.:,.~.~~.~. out in different court decisions and written opinions over time and has be- come case law. l~ Among several Pueblo communities, the matrilineal system holds that property belongs to the fe- male. In a divorce or separation, prop- erty is divided according to the matrilineal definitions of property ownership and is written into the deci- sions of the traditional or tribal court. Similarly, Navajo courts incorporate Navajo common law in decisions in probate, criminal, and child custody cases, and marital conflicts, ts For many tribes along the Northwest coast such as the Yurok, customary laws dictate the areas where families can conduct their fishing, hunting, and gathering. These areas are passed down from one generation to the next. When someone fishes in another fam- ily's area. it is considered an affront to the entire family. By custom, the 12.

I'l. ld wronged family convenes a family fo- rum as the proper way to handle the matter and to request compensation. Compensation may be with fish, fish- ing gear, feathers, hides, headwork, traditional clothing, or other forms of payment. Among several Pueblo communi- ties, it is customary for discipline to be administered by the fiscale, who is re- sponsible for maintaining the peace and overseeing the welfare of children and youth. It is a general practice for parents to summon the fiscale when their children are unruly or misbehav- ing. The fiscale advises the children about the consequences of their mis- conduct and may reprimand them or refer them and their parents to ser- vices such as counseling. In many tribes, information, beliefs, and customs are handed down orally or by example from one generation to another, t' For example, in the Minto Tribal Court of Alaska the resolution process involves a segment dedicated to \"traditional counseling\" by the fa- cilitator or presiding judge. There is a general practice of \"'advising giving\" November-December 1995 in the traditional courts of the Pueblos and the \"'talking to\" in the Navajo peace making system. This segment is traditionally set aside for the spokes- persons or tribal officials to speak of community values, mores, and the consequences of misbehavior or mis- conduct. Often these are conveyed in parables or creation narratives and be- liefs. Advice is given about harboring vengeful feelings, and everyone is en- couraged to renew relationships. The indigenous justice process Indigenous methods of conflict resolu- tion include traditional dispute resolu- tion, peace making, talking circles, family or community gatherings, and traditional mediation, described only by the language of the tribal commu- nity. All these refer to the methods of resolving problems and to the methods of restorative and reparative justice. The structure of relationships in many tribal communities is paramount to a legal system exemplified by the clan system. Tribal law determines clan identification, which is often matrilineal.

'6 The agreements reached in family and community forums are binding. Participants are compelled to comply through the same interlocking obliga- tions established in individual and community relationships. Compliance and enforcement are important as- pects of indigenous systems because there is little coercion. Accepting punishment does not guarantee that an offender will be accountable. Therefore, it is essendal that offenders perform outward acts to demonstrate their responsibility for correcting be- havior. Offender accountability is es- sential to ensure compliance with de- November-December 1995 cisions and to prevent further crimi- nality or relapse into deviant behavior. Equally important is for punitive sanc- tions to be decided and applied by in- dividuals who were affected by the offender's behavior. Historically, there is little evidence of penal systems in tribal communities. This fact remains today, ahhough there are many who express the need for secure confinement facilities to ad- dress serious and violent crimes. Many customary sanctions to appease vic- tims and to safeguard against ven- geance are still in use. These include public ridicule, public shaming, whip- pings, temporary and permanent ban- ishment, withdrawal of cidzen~ ship rights, financial and labor restitution, and community ser- vice. Some tribes still tem- porarily or permanently banish individuals who commit serious or violent crimes. Among the Warm Springs Tribes in Or- egon, it is customary to refer lawbreakers to the \"whipman,\" who may whip a person for mis- conduct. In the Laguna Aherna- fives for First Time Youth Of- fenders Program, community service is used extensively The indigenous process is also used in offenses where there are no victims, such ~ problems be- tween parents and children, in- dividual misconduct, or alcohol consumption. Family members af- fected by the offender's behavior or who are concerned with the offender's welfare may participate. Many tribal people view crime, delinquency, and other deviant behaviors as symptoms of bigger family problems. Widening the affected target group to include the of- fender, parents, siblings, and other ex- tended family members enlists help from those most familiar with the situa- tion to assist in correcting and prevent- ing more serious crime. The indigenous process can often be extremely uncomfortable and emo- tional because it involves participation by everyone affected, but great care is 15. Mehon. supra n. 6. at 16. 16. Bluehouse and Zion. (199S). taken to provide a safe envir6nment for matters to be discussed. The dis- tributive nature of this process uses the extended family as a resource for the offender, the victim, and the commu- nity to resolve problems, to ensure compliance, to provide protection, and to retain ownership of the problems.\" Preserving indigenous systems Tribes are faced with the inevitable conflict created by two justice para- digms competing for existence in one community. Many Americans be- lieve the law is something to be applied and justice ' is something to be admin- istered. In contrast, tribes traditionally believe law is a way of life and justice is a part of the life process. For one paradigm to ex- ist, it must convert people to follow it. Although it appears that tribal courts follow the Anglo-Ameri- can legal system, many adhere to the traditional values of the tribal justice system. This is largely be- cause tribes have been wary of the ethnocentric view of the Western colonizers who devalued their legal structures and ~anted to replace them with an imported West- ern system. 's Tribes were also re- quired to participate in the Anglo- American legal system in order to protect their lands and people, but they did so without trusting or believ- ing it. This foreign system was im- posed by the federal government, thereby thwarting their efforts to convert the uibes. Attempts to strengthen and re- traditionalize tribal justice systems stem from discontent with the efforts of modern tribal courts to address the crime, delinquency, social, and eco- nomic problems in tribal communities. It is joined by the dominant culture's current disillusionment with justice in this country, which causes doubt about retributive justice and a move toward a more restorative framework.\" This emerging restorative perspective for the American justice system is illus- trated by the following values: All parties should be included in the re- sponse to crime---offenders, victims, and the community. Government and local communities should play complemen- tary roles in that response. Accountabil- iv/is based on offenders understanding the harm caused by their offense, accept- ing responsibility for that harm. and re- pairing it .... [R]estorative justice guides The strong adversarial features of the American justice paradigm will always conflict with the communal nature of most tribes. professionals in the appropriate and eq- uitable use of sanctions to ensure that of- fenders make amends to victims and the community, u Conversion to the American justice paradigm is a difficult choice for tribes, particularly those with a func- tional indigenous justice system. For many, full conversion is not possible because the indigenous justice para- digm is too powerful to abandon. The strong adversarial features of the American justice paradigm will.always conflict with the communal nature of most tribes. For this reason, the inher- ent restorative and reparative features of the indigenous justice paradigm will continue to be more appealing to the majority of tribal people. Nonetheless, it is important for tribes to identify their community strengths and views onjustice, law, and order. The role of'non-Indians is to as- sist and support the tribes in strength- ening theirjustice systems and to sup press the urge tO take over or replace them. It is the sovereign and cultural right of tribes to explain, interpret, change, enact, and apply their own laws, oral and written, through what- ever mechanisms they choose. It is their responsiblli~to teach the knowl- edge and skills embedded in their in- digenous paradigm to their young. American Indian and Alas- kan Native people have the clearest understanding of their indigenous law ways because they live them. They must be the messen- gers of this law to preserve its integrity, authority, power, and meaning to the people. The many intrusions to the tribal way of life have interfered with the natural evolution of the indig- enous justice paradigm, but while slowed, it has never stopped. The tribal resurgence to strengthen and re- traditionalize their judiciaries has reju- venated the evolutionary process. While mainstream society is in the midst of shifting from a retributive jus- tice model to a restorative one, many tribes are strengthening their indig- enous paradigm. In doing so, they are empowering themselves to provide a justice system that has meaning to the people they serve and the power to per- petuate what was preserved by the ancestors and passed on by the elders as testimony of their commitment to the future of tribes. Contemporary American Indian and Alaskan Native people are now faced with making the same commitment to preserve the in- digenous justice system the elders maintained and find ways to perpetu- ate it. ifr$ 17.

I I I I I I I I Recent research indicates that individuals who are motivated to change have greater success in court imposed batterers treatment and are less inclined to re- offend. Appropriate jail programs can play a significant role in shaping the motivation of offenders. While jail administrators used to measure success by the level of safety and security afforded inmates and staff, there is an increasing demand upon jails to become agents in crime prevention. This workshop will describe an innovative domestic violence crime prevention program developed in the Sacramento Main Jail. The program is for pre-trial offenders to address the need to increase the offender's motivation to change and succeed in reducing violence. The audience will learn the value of a victim-centered curriculum and focus when working with batterers and the value of understanding the dynamics from the victim perspective.

C] A minimum of one year ofwceldy sessions, with additional sessions available within the program or through referrals when indicated. O The use of group counselling as the treatment of choice. This approach decreases the batterer's isolation and dependency on the partner and ensures the offender is accountable to the group. O Procedures for conducfng an ongoing assessment of the offender's violent pro- pensities throughout the course of treatment, such as informing the offender at the beginning of the program that the victim and others will be contacted peri- odically to assess whether the violence has stopped.

Hart, Esq., Staff Counsel, PCADV, 1992 I I I I I This paper will examine two issues- the risk to children posed by domestic violence and strategies for intervention to protect children from violent homes and their battered parents. It is imperative that the legal, medical and child abuse prevention communities join together to identify children at risk and to employ strate- gies that will both protect and heal the innocent victims of domestic violence, especially those most powerless, the children from violent homes. Risks posed to children from violent homes. i 1. Child Abuse. Men who batter their wives are likely to assault their children. The battering of women who are mothers usually i predates the infliction of child abuse (Stark & Flitcraft, 1988). At least half of all battering husbands also batter their children (Pagelow, I 1989). The more severe the abuse of the mother, the worse the child abuse (Bowker, Arbitell, and Mc_Ferron, 1988). Abuse of children by a i batterer is more likely when the marriage is dissolving, the couple has separated, and the husband/father is highly committed to contin- i ued dominance and control of the mother and children (Bowker, Arbitell, and McFerron, 1988). Since women and child abuse by husbands and I fathers is instrumental, directed at subjugating, controlling and isolating, when a woman has (Dobash and Dobash, 1979). Woman abuse is also the context for sexual abuse of female children. Where the mother is assaulted by the father, daughters are ex'posed to a risk of sexual abuse 6.51 times greater than girls in non-abu- sive families (Bowker, Arbitell, and McFerron, 1988). Where a male is the perpetrator of child abuse, one study demonstrated that there is a 70 percent chance that any injury to the child will be severe and 80 percent of child fatalities within the family are attributable to fathers and their surrogates 03er~, Lamen, and Mueller, 1986). Data gleaned from PCADV from news- paper clippings in 1990 reveals that every three days a woman or child is killed in the Common- wealth (Pennsylvania) by a batterer/father CYupcavage, 1991). Mothers who are battered are more likely to physically abuse their children than are non- battered women (Walker, 1984; Roy, 1977; Gayford, 1975). 2. Child abduction. Battering men use custodial access to the children as a tool to terrorize battered women or to retaliate for separation. Custodial interference is one of the few battering tactics available to an abuser after separation; thus, it is not surprising that it is used extensively. separated from her batterer and is seeking to Each year more than 350,000 children are establish autonomy and independence from abductedbyparentsinthiscountry;thatis,40.4 I him, his struggle to control and dominate her children are abducted per hour.

I subjugation of the children as a tactic of domi- nance and control of their mother (Stark and Flitcraft, 1988; Bowker, Arbitell and Mc.Fe.rron, 1988). Older children are frequently assaulted when they intervene to defend and protect their mothers (Hilberman and Munson, 1977- 78). Daughters are more likely than sons to become victims of the battering husband manipulations around custody orders, but 46 percent involve concealing the whereabouts of the child or taking the child out of state. Most of these abductions are perpetrated by fathers or their agents. Fully 41 percent occur between the separation of the parents and the divorce. Yet another 41 percent happen after the parents are separated or divorce for more than two years. Three of ten of the abducted children will suffer mild to severe mental harm as a I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I result of the abductions (Finkelhor, Hotaling, and Sedlak, 1990). More than half of these abductions occur in the context of domestic violence (Greif and Heger, 1992). 3. Observation of violence against moth- ers. The majority of the children from violent homes observe the violence inflicted by their fathers upon their mothers; most research sug- gests as many as 90 percent of children from violent homes witness their fathers battering their mothers (Pagelow, 1990; Walker, 1984). One study demonstrated that some fathers de- liberately arrange for the children to witness the violence (Dobash and Dobash, 1979), and other empirical work suggests that the violence occurs only when the children are present 0Rallerstein and Kelly, 1980). Children wit- nessing the violence inflicted on their mothers evidence behavioral, somatic, or emotional problems similar to those experienced by physi- cally abused children 0affe, Wolfe, and Wilson, 1990). Psychosomaticillness is prominent. Boys become aggressive, fighting with siblings and schoolmates, and have temper tantnmas. Girls are more likely to become passive, clinging, and withdrawn (Hiberman and Munson, 1977- 78). Male children who witness the abuse of 4. Separation violence. Many profession- als believe that the most effective thing that a battered mother can do to protect her children is to leave the battering husband. As a cultur we believe that if women leave, they will b~. safe, as will their children. Leave-taking alone does not protect battered women and children. Safety is only assured by strong legal and com- murdty protections. Research confirms that battering men often esculate violence to re-cap ture battered women and children who have sought safety in separa- tion. Battered women seek medical attention for injuries sustained as a consequence of do- mestic violence significantly more often after separation (Stark and Flitcraft, 1988). One in- vestigation demonstrated, that about 75 percent of the calls to law enforcement for intervention and assistance indomestic violence occur after separation from batterers (Langen & Innes, 1986). Another study revealed that half of the homicides of female spouses and partners were committed by men after separation or divorce ('Bamard, et al., 1982). A study in Philadelphia showed that one quarter of the women killr by their partners were killed after separatio. and a significant number were killed while mothers by fathers are more likely to become trying to separate from the assailant (C.asanave men who batter in adulthood than those male & Zal'm, 1986). children from homes free of violence I (Rosenbaum and O'Leary, 1981).

I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I ! I t I I I I I I Strategies to prqtect children from violent homes. Having identified the jeopardy to which children may be exposed in the context of do- mestic violence, it is imperative that profes- sionais identify strategies to safeguard against these risks. 1. Risk identification and safetyplanning. A critical strategy for child protection is prot~ col development by the medical, legal and so- cial service communities to help women recog- nize that they may be battered and that their children may be at risk for abuse. Once bat- tered women have identified that abuse in- Ricted on them and the risk for child abuse, they can then design strategic plans to avert violence whether they elect to remain in resi- dence with the batterer or separate from him. attempt to compel reconciliation, they often choose the visitation arena as a place in which to attempt coerced reconciliation or to penalize the battered partner for refusal to reconcile. As a consequence, visitation musf be a very pro- tected circumstance both for the children from violent homes and battered women. The Domestic Abuse Intervention Project of Duluth, Minnesota began a supervised visita- tion center project several years ago. The facil- ity offers supervised exchange, on-site visits and monitored visits, as well as education and counseling for fathers on parenting and the impact of domestic violence on children. Ser- vices and education are accommodated in a spacious and attractive, but secure, environ- ment. Participants in the program are referred by the courts or child protection services. The center is open twice a week, one weekend day l To accomplish this, professionals, induding and oneday and evening during theweek. The lawyers, doctors and social workers, must con- program safeguards battered women and chil- ! ! sistentiy identify domestic violence and talk about safety planning with battered women clients/patients.

Safety planning for unsupervised vis- its. Planning for unsupervised visits can help l children not only manage fear and anxiety, but In fact, there is strong evidence that bat- can also enable them to develop safety skills tered women's efforts to utilize community and realistic safety plans to minimize the risk of ! ! resources to end the violence are greater when child abuse is present, demonstrating that bat- tered women may be most motivated to change their circumstances when they conclude that it is critical to protect their children from the risks of abuse (Bowker, 1988). Research further re- I veals that child.abuse, whether by fathers or mothers, is likely to diminish once the battered violence during visitation. The process of safety planning fizrther allows children of battered women to understm~d and manage the multi- tude of conflicting feelings they may be experi- encing associated with visiting their fathers. It is critical that professionals help children iden- tify safety issues and build.problem-solving, safety skills. Safety planning for unsupervised mother has been able to access safety services visits may be initiated by professionals but l and achieve separation from the violent father should always be undertaken in consultation (Giles-Sims, 1985; Walker, 1984). with the non-abusive parent. 2. Supervised visitation centers. The sec- ond strategy is a very practical and feasible solution- supervised visitation centers. Much of separation violence is an attempt to coerce reconciliation. Since battering husbands/fa- thers have limited access to battered women to Any safety plan must be realistic. The plan should be simple. It must be age appropriate. The child must be competent to undertake the strategies designed. Perhaps only children above 8 years of age can be active participants in safety strategies. I I I I I I l i I I I I I I I I I I I I I Conclusion I ! I I I I I I Too often professionals do not identify do- mestic violence in the lives of female clients and are uncertain about remedial strategies even if abuse is identified (Hansen & Harway, 1992). Other professionals seek to penalize and blame battered women for failing to protect their chil- dren (Erickson, 1991). The inadequacyof pro- fessional endeavors endangers and isolates mothers and often interrupts the potential for strong alliance between mothers and children in the pursuit of safety. Professional initiatives to empower women so that they can seek lives free of violence and achieve the legal authority to protect their children and themselves from recurrent violence are preferred. Early inter- vention by professionals can avert the risks posed to children and their mothers in the context of domestic violence and can assist women in establishing stable and secure house- holds independent of battering men. Preven- tion efforts may offer children the best hope for violence-free and loving families. I I I References Bergman, A., Larsen, tL M., and Mueller, B.

Potential funding sources for victim assistance services will also be discussed. Tulsa, Oklahoma 1999 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I GENERAL OUTLINE FOR GRANT PROPOSAL Introduction Approximately three sentences - one paragraph. This is a very brief summary of your proposal. In one to two sentences outline the basic purpose of your.proposal. For example: \"The proposed project will provide child sexual abuse treatment services to 30 youth ages 3 - 17 on the Hopi Reservation. ! One sentence should include the amount you are reques\u00a3ing. \"The proposed project requests $50,000 for provision of treatment services.\"Or, you may wish to outline how the money will be used: \"The proposed project requests $50,000 to hire two professional therapists to provide counseling services to child victims.\" The Problem Statement or Statement of Need Why is this Project needed? Give some background to justify your request. If there are unique problems in your area, identify and justify them. If there are some services available in your area, how are they deficient? How will the funding you are requesting impact the problem? You want to just mention this here, you'll go into detail in the Methods section. Most grants will have page limits for all sections. The Problem Statement sets the stage. The information in each section should logically flow from section to section. You will introduce your needs in this section, then you'll outline the goals of your project (which should address the needs you described), then you'll describe how you will meet your goals in the Methods section. The final two sections, Evaluation and Budget, will address how you will evaluate whether you met your goals and how the money you are requesting will allow you to do what you are proposing to do. A grant proposal is a story with a beginning, middle, and end, all of which are connected. Get your reader to care about the \"plot.\" Get them involved, but keep your description simple. Don't use jargon or terms an outsider might not understand. Goals & objectives What are you going to do to address the problem(s) you've just described? Be specific. Make sure the problem statement and the goals are related. If you spent your,time describing the impact of child sexual abuse on teenagers, don't propose a treatment program for elementary age children. I I I I I I I I I I I I I I i I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I to the GOALS section. Make sure that you have a means of evaluating what you said you were going to do. If your goals can't be evaluated, change your goals. vagueness in your goals may become apparent when you try to explain how you will evaluate your goals. This section offers you the opportunity to insure that you have clearly defined, measurable goals. Budget Your budget should reflect the funds needed to meet your goals, as outlined in the Methods section. Following a brief budget summary you should include a detailed budget justification. The justification allows you the opportunity to explain any \"unusual\" expenditures. For example, many Reservations include vast geographic distances. In order to provide effective services you may need to travel large distances which means that you will need to rent a vehicle, pay for gasoline, and vehicle maintenance. In an urban setting, such expenditures may be unnecessary. You can use the budget justification to briefly explain the need for line items to cover these expenses. Make sure that you've introduced the major expenditures earlier in the proposal. There shouldn't be a surprise in the budget. Requesting funding for an Educator in the budget when you've spent your proposal talking about treatment doesn't make sense. So make sure that the funds you request relate directly to information previously provided in your proposal. This outline provides a general overview of information needed for most types of grant applications, including VOCA applications. Prepare a generic grant proposal following this outline, and you should be prepared to ~espond to a Request For Proposals (REP) when you receive one. Preparation will help you avoid last minute rushing. GOOD LUCK!

The values and principles are di~- played in Table 1.1, and each principle is briefly discussed below. I. Children with emotional disturbances should t~ave access to a comprehensive array of services that address their physical, emotional, social, and educational needs, it is axiomatic that children and their families should have access to comprehensive services across physical, emo- tional, social~ and educational domains. The Joint Commission on the Men- tal Health of Children (1969), the President's Commission on Mental Health (1978), and innumerable child mental health experts and advocates have stressed the conviction that a complete and comprehensive network of ser- Table 1.1. Values and Drmciples for the system of care Core Values 1. The system of care should be chi{~ centered and family focused, with the neecis of the chdd and family dictating the types and m,x of services provided. 2. The system of care should be community based, with the locus of services as well as management and decision-making responsibility resting at the community level. 3. The system of care should be culturally competent, with agencies, programs, and services that are responsive to the cultural, racial, and ethnic differences of the populahons they serve. Guiding Principles 1. Children with emotional disturbances should have access to a comprehensive array of services that address their physical, emotional, social, and educational needs. 2. Children with emotional disturbances should receive individualized services in accordance with the unique needs and potentials of each child and guided by an individualized service plan. 3.. Children with emotional disturbances should receive services within the least restrictive. most normative environment that is clinically appropriate. 4. The families and surrogate families of children with emotional disturbances should be full participants in all aspects of the planning and delivery of services. 5. Children wRh emotional disturbances should receive services that are integrate(I, with linkages between child-serving agencies and programs and mechanisms for planning, developing, and coordinating services. 6. Children with emotional disturbances should be provided with case management or similar mechanisms to ensure that multiple services are delivered in a coordinated and therapeutic manner and that they can move through the system of services in accordance with their changing needs. 7. Early identification and intervention for children with emotional disturbances should be promoted by the system of care in order to enhance the likelihood of positive outcomes. 8. Children with emotional disturbances should be ensured smooth transitions to the adult service system as they reach maturity. 9. The rights of children with emotional disturbances should be protected, and effective advocacy efforts for children and adolescents with emotional disturbances should be promoted. 1(3. \" Children with emot=onal d~sturbances should receive services without regard to race, religion, national ongin, sex, physical disability, or other characteristics, and services should be sensitive and responsive to cultural differences and special needs.

Preferred interventions are Ihose thai pro- vide the needed services and. al the same lime. are minimally intrusive in the normal day-In-day routine ol the child and family. An implicit goal of the system of care is In maintain as many children as possible in their ow,~ homes by providing a full range of lamily-|ocused and community-based servkes anti stm|+pollS. In too many cases, children are removed from their homes or placed in environmenls Ihal are more restrictive than Ihey actu- ally need. Although oul-oi+home or proleclive placements may be indicated some of the lime, hequenlly they are used because less reslriclive, com- mnnit)-based alternatives are not available, Accumulaling evidence indi- I I I I I I I I I I cah.s thai, when a comprehensive system uf care is availalde, many children with serious elnoli(mal disturbances can bt, ll)ainlaine, l within lht'ir own homes anti cumnmunilies (Behar. 1985, 1986; Friedmail & Street. 198.5; Sir, sol, 1988, 1993). It also is evident Ihal the needs of a small percentage of youlh with emolional disturbances cannot always be met in the less restrictive .e, eltings. In these cases, even inlensive nonresidential services may m)l meal Ihe ther- apeutic needs of the child and family, and it may not be in the chihl's I.,sl interest In remain with the family. Residential services shouhl be emphDyet| o.ly when more nornlalive, nonresidential options are not elleclive. In Ihe.~. situalions, residential services should be provided in the least restrictive selling possible, with the gclal of rapid reinlegraliml into the family or achievemenl of a stable, permanent placement. Within Ihe residential arena, there are a range of mtmre normative op- lions thai alle,npI tam approximate the child's natural envil.lnlnenl. I:or ex- all+me, therapeutic foster homes and family-style grnup homes create a family-type atmosphere and allow children In allend public schl.mJs and In remain involved in community aclivilies. According In Friedman, If.,se set+ vices have more polential |or helping youngsters realize the goal of return- ing to their own family and school than do residential services thai cut youngsters o|| Irom normalized |amily and educational environmenls (Friedman, 1983; Stroul, 1989). By the same token, residential services, when indicated, shnuhl be In- naiad as close as possible In the child's hi,me in order to cause li|e least disruption ol the child's links In family, friends, agencies, school, and com- munity. Services located close In home maximize the possibility of family involvement in Ihe Irealmen! prcx;ess and are m~Ire likely In prepare the child for successful reinlegration inlu the natural environment. It must be acknowledged thai there may be situations in which treat- sent in inslilulional settings is apprnpriale, In these cases, a child may nved highly specialized services that are not reproducible in a community selling.

Bazron, Karl Dennis, and Marva 1: Belljamin Ghildren of color--that is, children of African American, Lalino/I lispanic, Asian American/l'acific Islander, and Native American/Alaskan Native descent--are the fastest growing population within the United Stales. Ac- cording to the Children's Defense Fund (1991), these children comprised 30% of the population under the age of 19 years in 1990 and will comprise 33% by the year 2000. This trend is expected to continue so that, by the year 2020, children of color will constitute approximately 40% of the child population in the country. These changing demographics portend tremen- dous reliance on these youth for America's continued growth and prosper- ity in the 21st century. The importance of children of color to our future, however, is over- shadowed by the challenges they face in growin~ into productive and healthy citizens in a society where they are at a considerable disadvantage. For example, poverty disproportionately impacts children of color. Accord- ing to the Children's Defense Fund (|994), the peverty rate for children in young families (i.e., families headed by someone younger than age 30), is 29.3% for Caucasian children, 69.3% for African American children, and 52% for Latino children. In addition, the grim litany of problems facing children of color is all too familiar. Higher proportions of children of color die before birth or during infancy; have learning, emotional, and/or phys- ical disabilities; have higher school dropout rates'and fewer higher edvca- lion opportunities; become parents at an early age; enter the child welfare system and are placed out of their homes and communities; are incarcerated in youth delenlion facilities and \"rehabilitated\" into adult correctional sys- tems; or die as a result of homicide, suicide, or unintentional injuries beh~re reaching adulthood (Isaacs, 1993). Any one of these condilions can have a significanl impacl on Ihe e,no- tional well-being of children and adolescents. Yet youlh of color ,,flen have 23 24 / ISAAcS-SHOCKLEY El\" AL. limited access to mental health services. The chances are good that an Af- rican American adolescent with a serious emotional disturbance will end up in the juvenile justice system rathar than in the treatment selling to which his or her Caucasian counterpart would be referred (Comer & Hill, 1985; Gibbs, 1988; Hawkins & Salisbury, ina, 1989; Lewis, Shanok, Cohen, Kligfeld, & Frisone, 1980). A Native American child with serious emotional disturbance will likely go without treatment or be removed legally and geographically from his or her family and tribe (Berlin, 1983; Blum, Harmon, Harris, Bergeisen, & Resnick, 1992; LaFromboise & Low,1989). A Hispanic child with serious emotional dis- turbance will likely be assessed in a language not his or her own (Inclan & I-lerron, 1989; Morales, Ferguson, & Munford, 1986; Ramirez, 1989). An Asian American adolescent with a serious emotional disturbance will likely never come to the attention of the mental health system (Meinhardt, Tom, \"rse, & Yu, 1986; Nagata, 1989). In short, children and adolescents of color often do not get their needs met in the present system (Gibbs & Huang, 1989). Yet, they are more likely to be diagnosed as seriously emotionally disturbed than their Caucasian counterparts. When they do\" enter the system, they will experience more restrictive interventions and fewer community-based alternatives. Cultural trails, behaviors, and beliefs will likely be interpreted as weaknesses and as dysfunctional. The data are clear: Current systems of care provide dif- ferential treatment to children of color (Cummins, 1986; Kaufman, 1987; Ortiz Stehno, |982). By and large, our child-serving systems, including education, have been dismal fail- ures in meeting the needs of youth of color and helping them grow into productive adults. Those who continue to blame the \"victims\" rather than fix our systems are pursuing a course that is myopic, costly, and perilous (McLoyd, 1990). McLoyd and others suggest that, in order to fix child- serving systems, there is a need to understand the cultural, ecological, and structural forces that enhance or impede the healthy development of chil- dren of color. This chapter presents a philosophical framework for improving service delivery to children of color. Although the emphasis is on those youth who suffer from serious emotional disturbances, the framework for a culturally competent system of care can be useful to any child-serving system. The framework grows out of increasing recognition that children and adoles- cents of color are unserved, underserved, or inappropriately served by most pub- lic and private sector mental health systems within the United States (Isaacs & Benjamin, 1991). This framework emphasizes an understanding of the importance of culture and building service systems that recognize, incor- porate, and value diversityma cultural competence model. mm m m m m m m m m m FRAMEWORK FOR CULTURALLY COMPE1ENT CARE / 25 DEFINITION OF CULTURAL COMPETENCE Cultural competence provides systems, agencies, and practitioners with the capacity to respond to the unique needs of populations whose cultures are different from that which might be called Eurocenlric or \"mainstream\" American (Cross, Bazron, Dennis, & Isaacs, 1989). The word \"culture\" is used and defined as \"the integrated pattern of human behavior that in- cludes thoughts, communication styles, actions, customs, beliefs, values, and institutions of a racial, ethnic, religious, or social group\"; the word \"competence\" is defined as \"the capacity to function in a particular way\"mthe skills and abilities to perform a set of tasks successfully (Cross et al., 1989, p. 3). Thus, cultural competence can be defined as a set of con- gruent behaviors, attitudes, practices, and policies that come together in a system or agency or atnong professionals and enable thai system or agency or those pro- fessionals to work effectively in cross-cultural situations. As defined here, cultural competence should lead to the developm'ent of culturally appropriate prevention and treatment strategies. According to Marin (1989), such strategies should l) be based on the cultural values of the targeted group; 2) reflect the subjective cultural characteristics of the members of the targeted group (i.e., their attitudes, expectancies, and norms regarding a particular behavior); and 3) reflect the behavioral preferences and expectations of the members of the group. Five essential elements contribute to a system, agency, or professional becoming more culturally competent (Cross et al., 1989; Isaacs & Benjamin, 1991): valuing diversity, undertaking cultural self-assessment, understand- ing the dynamics of difference, institutionalization of cultural knowledge, and adaptation to diversity. Valuing Diversity The first essential element is to value diversity. To value diversity is to see and respect its worth. A mental health service is strengthened when it ac- cepts that the people it serves are from very different backgrounds and will make different choices based on culture. Although all people share common basic needs, there are vast differences in how people of various cultures go about meeting those needs. These differences are as important as the sim- ilarities. We must begin to see differences as something positive and as something that has value. In valuing diversity, we acknowledge cultural differences and become aware of how these differences affect the helping process. Because American society operates predominantly out of a l'orocentric framework, and its institutions--including those for mental health--are es- tablished based on the values inherent in such a framework, it has been particularly difficult for children and families of color, who often have a m m m m m m m m m .... .I ...... I i I i I I I i i I i I i I i i i 26 / ISAACS-SHOCKLEY ET AL. differing value base, to be effectively served and assisted by American in- stitutions. There are assumptions of cultural blindness and assimilation in- herent in these institutional values andpractices that fail to recognize the richness and values of other cultures. An approach that values diversity would assure that these differences between groups, as well as within groups, are acknowledged and incorporated into programs and services. Cultural Self-Assessment In order to understand the role that culture plays in another's life, it is important that each individual become aware of the role it plays in his or her own life. Many people never acknowledge how .their day-to-day be- haviors and attitudes have been shaped by their own cultural values and reinforced by families, peers, and social institutions. Agencies and systems also have cultures that are reflecled in the way they are structured, the kinds of stall they seek, and the policies and prac- tices that are implemented. Thus, agencies also must undertake a self- assessment process to gain a clearer understanding of the values and attitudes that are at the roots of the organization. When personnel under- stand how their agency is shaped by its culture, then it is easier ior them to assess how the agency interfaces with other cultures. For example, if \"family\" refers to immediate families in one culture and in another cullt, re denotes extended family or kinship networks, Ihen concepts such as \"family involvement\" will mean something different. Recognition and involvement of kinship networks will require some adjustments in agency policies and interventions for an agency that thinks \"immediate\" when family is dis- cussed. Otherwise, their services simply will not work for populations thai conceptualize family in a different way. Thus, in order to provide sensitive and competent care to clients from cultures thai are different from one's own, there must be 1) an awareness of one's own cultural values and beliefs and a recognition of how these influence one's attitudes and behaviors, and 2) an understanding of the cultural valt, es and beliefs of one's clients and how these influence their altitudes and behaviors (Randall-David, 199(I). It should be noted that often staff from the same ethnic group as a client assume thai they understand the client's culture and that there is no need for this lype of cultural self-assessment. However, cultural competence is not a given because there are as many variations withilt cultures as betweell cultures. For example, in African American professional-client relation- ships, there are cultural differences based on geographical Iocalions as well as on socioeconomic and educational differences. Although there is a ten- dency to \"hlmp'\" all Asian Americans or Hispanics into one category, there are many different cultures and languages represented within these groups. Therefore, this need for cultural self-assessment must occur at the individ- FRAMEWORK FOR CUL1URALI..Y COMPIE1ENT CARE ] 27 ual and agency levels even when there is a common elhnicity wilh the clienl/consunler groups. Dynamics of Difference The third essential elemenl of cultural competency is lhat of underslanding and acknowledging the dynamics of difference. When prnfessionals of one culture interact with a population from another, both may misjudge the other's actions based on learned expectations. Each brings to the relation- ship unique histories and the influence of current political relationships between the two groups. Both will bring culturally prescribed patterns of communication, etiquette, and problem solving. Both may bring stereotypes or underlying feelings about serving or being served by someone who is different. African Americans, for example, may exhibit behaviors expressing stress, anger, and frustration that may make the agency staff t, ncomfortable. The agency and its staff must be constantly vigilant about the dynamics of difference in order to avoid misinterpretation and misjudgment. Historical distrust is one such dynamic that often occnrs belween a helper from the dominant culture and a client from an ethnic minority community. Historical discrimination and racism are some of the core un- derpinnings of the relationship between people of color and the dominant Eurocentric culture. Nickens (1990) states that \"many minority communities feel substantial mistrust of the government, its agents and its inf,~rmalion\" (p. 134). For example, just as Native Americans view the intrt~ductit~n t~f alcohol into their culture as a form of genocide, so do many African Amer- icans view the level and types of illegal drugs in their comnumilies as a modern-day form of genocide. They often distrust Ihose who preach a \"war on drugs\" because the war seems to result in a disprnportionale number of deaths and incarcerations for young African American males and females (lsaacs, 1993). Such dynamics of difference must be clearly understood so that effec- tive strategies can be developed to mitigate the impact of historical distrttst and other dynamics of difference that can significantly impede a positive interaction between groups from different cultures. It is important to n()le that the dynam!cs of difference are always a two-way process in a cross- cultural situation. By incorporating an understanding of these dynamics and their origins into service systems, the chances for prodt,clive cross- cultural interventions are enhanced. Institutionalization of Cultural Knowledge An agency must sanction, and in some inslances mandate, the incorporali(~n of cultural knowledge into the service delivery framewc~rk. This kn,~tvledge must be available at every level of the organizalitm. This kn,~wh,dge base should include information about a culture, such as crilical alliludes, val- ues, communication patterns, and laistory. i,nl'~t)rlanl I(1 explnrt, 28 / JSAAcs-SHOCKLEY El\" AL. FRAMEWORK FOR CULTURALLY COMPETENr CAnE / 2g haw cultural values are related to mental health and help-seeking patlerns, concepts of health and wellness, and attitudes toward services and pro- grams. Agencies can institutionalize cultural knowledge lhrough such ap- proaches as required in-service training for staff; collection of journal arti- cles and other print resources; use of consultants, natural helpers, healers, key community leaders, and advisory committees; and linkages with ad- vocacy groups. In other words, an agency must develop specific mecha- nisms tO secure the cultural knowledge it requires to be effective in its interactions with clients. The development of knowledge through culturally competent research and demonstration projects must also be included in strategies to institutionalize cultural knowledge. Adaptation to Diversity The final element of a culturally competent delivery system is the adapta- tion of services and programs to reflect cultural specificity and diversity. The first four elements mean little if organizations do not change the way they work with people or the ways in which they provide services. Agen- cies can adapt or adjust their helping approaches to compensate for and acknowledge cultural differences. Styles of interviewing, focusing on strengths rather than deficits, changing and accepting other definitions of \"family,\" and changing approaches and types of services offered are all ways that agencies can adapt in order to become more culturally competent. THE CULTURAL COMPETENCE CONTINUUM Mason (1989), Cross (1992), and others have developed cultural competence assessment instruments that can be used by individuals and agencies to assess their levels of cultural competence, based on the five essential ele- ments previously discussed, it is important to understand that cultural com- petence is a developmental process. In our society, everyone must work toward this goal, and there is little that prepares us to acknowledge or appreciate multiculturalism. Rather, the primary goal in American society has been assimilation and acculturation. Thus, cultural competence is not something that occurs because one reads a book, or attends a workshop, or goes to an ethnic festival, or happens to be a member of an ethnic group. It is a process born of a commitment to provide quality services and to make a positive difference for clients and communities of color. To better understand where one is in the process of becoming more culturally competent, it is useful to think of the possible ways of responding to cultural differences. If one imagines a continuum that ranges from cul- tural destructiveness to cultural proficiency, there are a variety of possibil- ities between these two extremes. Cross et al. (1989) describe six points m i | m m i i i m I I m along the continuum and the characteristics that might be exhibited by an agency or an individual at each level of the continuum. Cultural Destructiveness The most negative end of the continuum is represented by attitudes, p(~li- cies, and practices that are destructive to cultures and consequently to the individuals within these cultures. The most extreme example of this ori- entation is programs and policies that promote or actively participate in cultural genocide--the purposeful destruction of a culture. The institution of American slavery is a dominant example for African Americans. Another example is the Exclusion Laws of \"1885-1965 (Hune, t977), which prohibited Asians from bringing spouses to this country, imposed immigration quotas, and denied them basic human rights on the state and federal levels. Equally destructive is the process of dehumanizing or subhumanizing clients of color. Historically, some agencies have been actively involved in services that have denied people of color access to their natural helpers or healers, removed children of color from their families on the basis of race, or pur- posely risked the well-being of minority individuals in social or medical experiments without their knowledge or consent. A system that adheres to this extreme assumes that one race is superior and should eradicate '~lesser\" cultures because of their perceived subhuman position. Bigotry coupled with vast power differentials allows the dominant group to disenfranchise, control, exploit, or systematically deslroy the mi- nority population. Although such overt practices had disappeared from the American scene, there is increasing concern that this type of approach is again on the upswing (e.g., the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan, white supremacy groups, skinheads). Cultural Incapacity The next position on the continuum is one at which the system or agencies do not intentionally or consciously seek to be culturally destructive but rather lack the capacity to help clients and communities of color. At this level, the agency or individual remains extremely.biased, believes in the racial superiority of the dominant group, and assumes a paternal posture toward \"lesser\". races. These agencies may disproportionately apply re- sources, discriminate against people of color on the basis of whether they \"know their place,\" and believe in the supremacy of dominant culture help- ers. Such agencies may support segregation as a desirable policy. They may act as agents of oppression by enforcing racist policies and maintaining stereotypes, Such agencies often are characterized by ignorance and an un- realistic fear of people of color. The characteristics of cultural incapacity include discriminator), hiring practices, subtle messages to pe(~ple of color m i i g m | i | m m m m m m m m m m m m m n n mm m m m m ii iii .... 30 / ISAAcs-SHOCKLEY El\" AL. thai they are not valued or welcome, and generally lower expectations of minorily clients. Cullural Blindness .o At lhe n'|idpoint on the conlint, um, the system and its agencies provide services with the express philosophy of being unbiased. They |unction with the belief Ihat color, race, or culture make no difference and th,ll we art' nil the same. Cullurally blind agencies are characlerized by the belief Ihal help- ing approaches traditionally used by the dominant culture are universally applicable; if the system worked as it should, all people~regardless of race or culture~would be served with equal effectiveness. This view reflects a well-intentioned liberal philosophy. However, the conseqt,ences of such a belief are Io make services so ethnocentric as to render lhem virtually use- less to all but the most assimilated people of color. Ethnocentrism refers to misinterpretation and misjudgment based on looking at another person's behavior from one's own cultural reference point and a belief that one's cultt, re is Ihe best and only way to interpret reality. Such services ignore cultural strengths, encourage assimilation, and blame lhe victims for their problems. Members of minority communities are viewed from the cultural'deprivation model, which asserts thai prob- lems are the resull of inadequate cultural resources. Outcome is usually measured by how closely the client approximales a middle-class nonmi- nitrify existence. Inslilulional racism restricts minority access to professional training, staff position, and services. These agencies may participate in special projects with minority pop- ulations when monies are specifically available or with the intent of \"res- cuing\" people .of color. Unfortunately, such projects are often conducted without community guidance and are the first casualties when funds run shorl. Cttllurally blind agencies suffer from a deficit of information and often lack the avenues through which they can obtain needed information. Although these agencies often view themselves as unbiased and responsive to minority needs, their ethnocentrism is reflected in attitude, policy, and practice. Cultural Precompetence As agencies move toward the positive end of the scale, they reach a position called \"cultural precompetence,\" a term chosen because it implies move- ment. The precompetent agency realizes it has weaknesses in serving peo- ple of color and attempts to improve some aspect of its services to a specific population. Such agencies try experiments, hire minority staff, explore how to reach people of color in their service areas, initiate training for their workers on cultural sensilivily, enter inlo needs assessments concerning minority communities, and recruit minorily individuals for their boards of directors or advisory committees. Precompelenl agencies are characterized FRAMEWORK FOR CULTURALLY COMPE'1ENT CARE / 31 by tile desire to deliver quality services and a commitnaent to civil rights. They respond to minority communities' cry for improved services by ask- ing, \"What can we do?\" One danger at this level is a false sense of accomplislnuent or of [allure that prevents tile agency from moving forward along the continuum. An agency may believe Ihal the accomplishmellt of one goal or activity fulfills its obligation to minority communities or may undertake an activity that fails and is lherefore reluctant to try again. Another danger is tokenism. Agencies sometimes hire one c)r more (usually assimilated) workers of color and believe they are then equipped to meet the need. Although hiring staff of color is very important, it is no guarantee that services, access, or sensitivity will be improved. Because professionals of color are trained in the dominant society's frame of refer- ence, they may be little more competent in cross-cultural practice than their co-workers. These professionals, like all others, need training on the ft,nc- tion of cullure and its impact on client populations. The precompelenl agen- cy, however, has begun the process of becoming cultt, rally competent and often only lacks information on what is possible and how to proceed. Basic Cultural Competence Culturally competent agencies are characterized by acceptance and respect for difference, continuing self-assessment regarding ct,lture, careful allen- lion to the dynamics of difference, continuous expansion of cultural knowl- edge and resources, and a variety of adaptations to service models in t~rder to belier meet the changing needs of minority popt, lations. The culturally competent agency works to hire unbiased employees, seeks advice and clm- sultation from the minority community, and actively decides what it is and is not capable of providing to clients of color. Often, there is ongoing dia- logue and input from the minority commt, nily at all levels of the organi- zation and a network with other formal and informal supports within the community. Advanced Cultural Competence or Cultural Proficiency The most positive end of the scale is advanced cultural competence or pro- ficiency. This point on the continuum is characterized by holding culture in high esteem. The culturally proficient agency seeks to add to the know- ledge base of culturally i:ompetent practice by conducting research, devel- oping new lherapeutic approaches based on culture, evaluating and dis- seminaling Ihe results of demonstration projects, and experimenting wilh changes in organizational structures lhal support critical cultural values and beliefs. The culturally proficient agency hires staff who are specialisls in culturally competent practice. Such an agency advocates for culloral compe- tence throughoul the system and for improved relations belween ct,ltures throughout society. 32 / ISAAcs-SHOCKLEY El\" AL. Summary The degree of cultural competence a~.agency achieves is not dependent on any one factor. Attitudes, policies, and practices are Ihree major arenas where development can and must occur if an agency is to move toward cultural competence. Attitudes change to become less elhnocentric and bi- ased. Policies change to become more flexible and culturally sensitive. Prac- tices become more congruent with the culture of the client from initial contact through termination, MAJOR CULTURAL COMPETENCE PRINCIPLES A core set of principles underlie the concept of cultural competence and act as guidelines for developing culturally competent delivery systems (Cross et al., 1989; isaacs & Benjamin, 1991): The family as defined by each culture is the primary system of support and preferred intervention. The syslem musl recognize that minority populations must be at least hi- cultural and that this status creates a unique sel of psychological/emotional issues Io which the sysfem must be equipped to respond. Individuals and families make different choices based on cultural forces; lhese choices musl be considered if services are to be helpful. Practice is driven by culturally preferred choices, not by culturally blind or culture-free interventions. Inherent in cross-cultural interaclions are dynamics that must be acknowl- ed~ged, adjusled Io, and accepted. The service system musl sanction, and in some cases mandate, the incor- poration of cullural knowledge into practice and policy-making activities. Cultural competence involves delermining a client's cultural location in or- der Io apply the helping principle of \"starting where the client is\" and in- cludes understanding the client's level of acculturation and assimilation. Cultural competence involves working in conjunction with nalural, informal support and helping networks within the minority community (e.g., neigh- borhood organizations, churches, spiritual leaders, healers, community lead- ers). Cultural competence embraces and extends the concept of \"'self-deter- mination\" to services offered in communities of co)or. Culturally competent services seek to match Ihe needs and help-seeking be- havior of the client population. Beyond services, culturally competent agencies recognize that they also have a role of advocacy and empowermenl in relationship to their clients and the minority community in which Ihey attempt to deliver highly responsive ser- vices. (Isaacs & Benjamin, 1991, pp. 52-54}. BARRIERS TO CULTURAL COMPETENCE Although cullural competence appears to be a natural and effective ap- proach to the increasing concern about providing acceptable and quality services to clients of color in a cost-effective manner, there are many rests- m m m u m m m m m FRAMEWORK FOR CULTURALLY COMPETENT CAnE / 33 lances and barriers to agencies adopting a cultural competence philosophy and framework. Bernard (1992) and other authors have identified several major barriers to implementation of cultural competence in health and hu- man services agencies. These include The \"isms\"--racism, sexism, classism, and other such \"isms\" \"It's nol culture, it's poverly\"--the inability to accept culture as a factor and arguing against giving it prominence, although there is also greal inertia in addressing poverty as well. This allilude keeps discussion on an intellectual and conceptual level so thai actions to address either are not taken Cultural blindness--that is, the belief that color or culture makes no difference in assessment and treatment and, therefore, there is no need for change \"What's in it for me?\"--insufficient motivation or will Io initiate or par- ticipate in changes \"Full plate'--the claim of a lack of time \"Too many demands'--jumping from crisis to crisis, with a lack of en- ergy to deal with new changes \"No extra funding'reviewing bilingual, bicultural, and ethnic-specific services as \"luxury\" items \"Too much, too fast\"--being overwhelmed and paralyzed by the dra- matic increase of many groups of color; there is an inability to set pri- orities or know \"where to begin\" \"Too difficult to change\"minsufficienl leadership in the organization and inadequate management skills to cope with change \"Powerless\"--a lack of political support and/or resources to implemenl change Some of these barriers and resistances will be recognized fllrough the cultural self-assessment process; others will only become visible when Ihe agency embarks on a course of action to increase its level of cultural com- petence, it is usually helpful to provide outside facilitation and consultation regarding known and unknown resistances to change. It has become very clear that, in order for cultural competence to occur, there must be buy-in from the top leaders in the agency, and there should be specific aclivities undertaken so that buy-in by lower-level slaff occurs. INFUSING CULTURAL COMPETENCE AT ALL LEVELS OF AN AGENCY When many people think of cultural competence, they Ihink only in terms of the direct service provider-client relationship. AIIhough lhis is cerlaiMy an extremely important relationship, most direct service providers do not work in a vacuum. Rather, they work in agencies Ihal have policy makers m m m m m m m m m m I.. I .I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 34 / ISAACS-SHOCKLEY El\" AL. and administrators who play a very important role in setting the policies and program directions for the agency. If direct service providers are ex- pected to be the only staff to incorporate cullural competence in their prac- lice, wilhout supportive policies, surlervision, and program adaptations, then they are being set up to fail. To be effective, cultural competence musl have commitment and atlention from all levels of an nrganization: its policy makers, ils administrators/managers, ils direct service providers, and its consumers/clients. Policy-Making Level The policy makers or planners of services may be board members of privale agencies, public agency officials, legislators, commissioners, and/or task force or advisory board members. Anyone who has a voice in the shaping of policy might be included. At lhis level, there are a number of aclions lhal would enhance cullural competence. These actions may include lhe following: I. Involve communilies of color. Persons of color, living wilhin the affected community, can be recruited and asked In serve on boards, advisory committees, and commissions thal already exisl in the agency or sys- tem. The agency could also create special task forces or advisory groups that are represenlalive of the minority communily In study and address issues of that parlicular community. 2. Set slaudards fi~r cross-cullural services. An agency board may develop standards it expecls ils employees In follow. Standard-setting bodies can incorporate cultural compelence inlo existing standards for services. Slales having licensing requiremenls for professionals mighl add ct, l- rural coml~etence to the required skills of a profession. 3. Sancliou, and in some cases require, parlicipation in lrainiug thai builds cul- lural knowledge anti skills. It is not enough to require that direcl service providers receive training/it is also important that policy makers them- selves receive and participate in such training as well. 4. lucortmrale cultural comt~eleuce iulo executive orders amt legislaliou al Ihe sh!te and lacal govermnenl levels. Policy can be both integrated into ex- isling laws and formulated in new Jaws. 5. Use research aud data Io guide decisian making. Policies can be imple- mented that ensure that adequate and accurate data and informatinn are collected on groups of color, thai research is monitored to avoid cultural bias or intrusion, that minority researchers are utilized and supported, and that the minority community is involved in the research and data-collection process and receives feedback about results and findings. 6. Create a decision-makiug slructure thai allows minority participaliou in the process.

Through the use and expansion o( contracting, more funding can be directed at minority service providers and agencies. Funding agencies also can develop service and staffing requirements (Ihrough performance contracting) thai provide incentives for agencies In become more culturally competent. 8. Develai~ at all levels. Actions such as incorporating cultural competence development into an agency's 5-year plan can help the pob icy maker break the process into manageable parts with reasonable limelines. There also may be a need to develop a specific cultural com- petence action plan. 9. Participate iu resource developmeut aud pro,gram fosteri,\u00a2,. Agencies can ac- lively work in conjunction with communilies of color In enable the cre- alton and healthy growth of a service. Established agencies can assist in the start-up and nurturance of new specialized programs for groups of color and then spin them off In full community self-control. Administrative/Management Level The administralive level of service delivery is composed of agency direc- tors, managers, deparlment heads, supervisors, and a variely of other peo- pie in both public and private organizations. This level interprets and implements policy in addition to creating it. It is at the administrative level of an organizalion lhat cullural is'In set the context for the developnlent of cultural competence. Some of the actions that can be taken at this level include I. Establishing and sanctioning some form of agency self-assessment 2. Ensuring thai persons of color are recruited and retained on staff 3. Ensuring that cultural competence training and skill dew_,lopmenl are included in the agency's staff orientation and il'l-service Iraining 4. Adapting personnel policies to make an agency more culturally com- petent 5. Developing program evaluation mechanisms that specifically largel cli- enls of color to determine lheir perceptions of the agency's effectiveness and lheir satisfaction with services offered 6.

Using the capacily In develop new approaches or adjusl exisling ones 36 / ISAACS-SHOCKLEY El\" AL. Although actions at the administrative level alone cannot bring an agency In cultural compelence, administrators are in key positions to jump start the process. ., Direct Service Provider Level Sound cross-cultural practice begins with a commitment from the direct service provider to offer culturally competent services. Throughout the in- take, assessment, diagnosis, treatment, referral, and termination process, the cvltural competence of the worker is crucial for determining the success of the intervention. Wilson (1982) listed personal attributes, knowledge, and skills thai are essential for a culturally competent service provider: 1 Personal Attributes Personal qualities that reflect genuineness, accurate empathy, nonpossessive warmth, and a capacity to respond flexibly to a range of possible solutions Acceptance of ethnic differences between people A willingness to work with clients of different ethnic minority groups Articulation and clarification of personal values, stereotypes, and biases re- lated to one's own and others' ethnicity and social class, and ways these may accommodate or conflict with the needs of minority clients Personal commitment to change racism and poverty Resolulion about nne's professior|al image in fields that have systematically excluded people of color 2. Knowledge Knowledge of the cullure (history, traditions, values, family systems, artislic expressions) of minority clients Knowledge of the impact of class and elhnicity on behavior, attitudes, and values Knowledge of the help-seeking behaviors of minority groups Knowledge of the role of language, speech patterns, and communicalion styles in etl'mically distinct communities Knowledge of the impact of social policies o.I minority clients Knowledge of the resources (agencies, persons, informal helping networks, research) that can be utilized on behalf of minority clients and communities Knowledge of power relationships within the community, agency, or insti- tution and their impact on minority clients 3. Skills Techniques for learning the cultures of minorily client groups Ability to communicate accurate information on behalf of minority clients and their commvnities Ability to openly discuss racial and ethnic differences and issues and to respond to culturally based cues Ability to assess the meaning ethnicity has for individual clients Ability to differentiate between the symptoms of inlrapsychic stress and stress arising from the social stroclure Inlerviewing techniques reflective of the worker's understanding of the role of language in the client's culture m i m m m m I m I 16 \u00a2 m FRAMEWORK FOR CULTURALLY COMPETENr CARE / 37 . Ability to utilize the concepts of empowerment on behalf of minority clients and communities Capability of using resources on behalf of minority clients and their com- munities Ability to recognize and combat racism, racial stereotypes, and mylhs in individuals and in institutions Ability to evaluate new techniques, research, and knowledge as Io their va- lidity and applicability in working with minorities The direct care provider can gain these skills and this knowledge through training and experience. The personal attributes can be developed through exposure to the positive aspects of cultures. Informalion is a strong tool in the development of cultural competence, and workers should avail themselves of every opportunity to build their cultural knowledge Such knowledge must, however, be coupled with a willingness to let clients and cultural groups determine their own future. Client/Consumer Level Families, as service consumers, also have a role in the development of the cultural competence of the system. Families can become more effective ad- vocates for their children when they gain the skills to articulate the impor- tance of their culture. Families also can be resources in the System's training process by talking about the natural networks and insisting that significant parts of their networks be included in the helping process for their chiklren. Families encountering insensitive services can turn to each other for aid in interfacing With the system. Families linked with other families can provide mutual support and help define issues from Iheir perspectives. CONCLUSION There are many challenges associated with the development of more effec- tive systems of care for responding to the mental health needs of cllildren and adolescents of color and their families. We must begin to meet these challenges through more thoughtful attention to cultural variations (even within our own cultural groups), increased cultural knowledge, attitudinal changes, and the development of more effective programs. Cultural competence has a critical role to play in systems of care and the agencies and services that comprise them. Unless our systems devise a more appropriate way to prevent and intervene in mental health problems among youth of color, we will continue to hinder and restrict healthy de- velopment. We must begin Io direct our energies and resources toward the development of interventions that work for the populations we need Io reach. We cannot develop effective mental health services for children and families of color until we understand the imporlant role that culh,re plays and until we examine our own attitudes and those of the agencies in which we work. Therefore, it is imperalive thai we all become more culturally competent. m n m m m m m m m 1 1 1 / / 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 l l m 1 1 -- I I I IH .... 18 / ISAACS-SHOCKLEY ET AL. ~EFERENCES k'rlin, I.N.

Participants will learn about the role of art in wellness. 2. Participants will learn to create symbols unique to their vision and voice. 3. Participants will learn how to bring elements of this workshop to their families or work situations. A hands-on workshop in the ancient practice of art as medicine using natural sticks and the symbolism of colored yarns and fabric. The talking stick is a tool for listening, in this case, listening to your inner wisdom and the inner quality of your life experiences. Participants will begin with a brief conversation about the loss of voice they may have experienced as in individuals and as a people. We will examine the nature of the creative inner voice and how it has transformed painful or difficult experiences into wisdom, resilience and humor. Following the initial discussion, participants will be invited to select a stick and begin wrapping and winding the sticks with colored yarns and fabric as symbols of their struggles and strengths. Creating a \"talking\" stick provides a powerful way to carry the story of your courage and the uniqueness of your voice to the next generation. When the sticks are completed, an opportunity for discussion will be provided where participants may choose to share their stories and sticks in groups of two or three. There will be a final sharing all together and ideas will be exchanged about how the experience of the talking stick might be used with others, at work or at home. This is a 2 part session and participants are strongly encouraged to attend both sessions.

He was out of control/drunk/high. It didn't hurt that much.\" The abuser, who rarely gets beyond this stage, .says: \"I didn't really hurt her much. She made me angry. I didn't know what I was doing. I was out of control/drunk/high.\" SELF-BLAME This, as we have seen, is an inescapable feature of life with a batterer as well as being a recurring component in three of the stages of the Psychological Reactions to Trauma. SEEKING HELP Law enforcement and social services agencies most often see victims seeking help at the third and fourth stages of the Progression of Abuse. A 1988 study by Dr. Gondolf indicated that helpseeking behavior increases when the positive aspects of a relationship decrease and the cost, in terms of abusiveness and injury, increases. AS~,FVALENCE The victim is irresolute at this stage, trying one alternative after a:~other. It is at this point that she will respond to the batterer's attempts to reconcile, or initiate attempts at reconciliation herself. It is the victim's behavior during this stage which appears to cause the greatest frustration and anger in members of the helping professions. Most often, these attempts at reconciliation do not work, but rather, end in further abuse. She may seek therapy for herself or for the abuser so she can stay in the relationship, or she may leave the relationship for a time and then return. Family therapy is a very common \"solution\" but it is not really a solution since psychotherapists who are trained to focus on the emotions and behaviors of their client, rather than the others in her life, often blame the victim and try to teach her what she can do to keep things quiet for him. The victim is determined to make things work if there's ANY hope. Gondolf found that it was the batterer's being in counseling that was the most powerful predictor of whether the victim will return. This is why it is so dangerous to send batterers to pre-trial diversion. The prosecutor is satisfied, feeling that at least something is being done to help the family, and the victim feels safer, believing that counseling will stop him from abusing her. But both are being lulled into a false sense of security given the current extremely low \"cure\" rate of counseling for batterers. Pre-trial diversion means that there are no immediate sanctions imposed if -- or, more likely, when -- the abuser doesn't complete his contract. Months later, when and if the case comes to trial, the evidence is cold and the batterer has had months to intimidate the victim intonot cooperating with the prosecution and/or to marshall a defense. I - 35 I I I I I I I I I I I I i I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I ~.-~:-.-.: It is in recognition of the difficulty or\" this stage that the Legislature provided sole possession of the home as a form of relief \"from abuse. It is vital to provide the victim with a safe environment in which to make decisions. When victims go to cou~ to terminate their Relief From Abuse Orders, some enlightened judges suggest that victims suspend the sole possession or\" the home provision while retaining the provision restraining the defendant from abusing her so batterers get the message that a return to the home does not mean that the violence can resume, and victims can learn that they no longer have to live with violence. This stage can last for years as the victim slowly gets the strength and support from each voyage to the outer world, so to speak, to overcome her psychological restraints so she can move on to the final stage: LIVLNG WITHOUT VIOLENCE Although a survivor of domestic abuse may live without violence after leaving an abusive relationship, as we have seen in the Psychological Reactions to Trauma, she may .well suffer from long-term depression and P.T.S.S. along with a host of other stress reactions to the violence and trauma she has suffered.

To explore the relationship between confidentiality and safety for battered women. 2. To demonstrate how the trust Native women have for tribal-based domestic violence programs is integral to the value of services. In order for a domestic violence program to be useful for the women using it, it is essential that the confidentiality of the battered women be firmly established. Without that confidentiality, not only is the women's safety precarious, but her trust for the program will be compromised, thus rendering it useless. This workshop will examine how to develop tribal policy to ensure that the confidentiality of battered women is honored, as well as the application of federal data privacy and confidentiality laws that apply within tribal jurisdictions.

Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts (or Drug Courts) are specialized court dockets given the responsibility to handle cases involving alcohol and other drug offenders through comprehensive supervision, drug testing, treatment services, and immediate sanctions and incentives. The drug court concept involved holding the offender accountable by leveraging the coercive power of the criminal justice system to achieve abstinence and alter criminal behavior. The drug court concept is a flexible concept which is consistent with traditional Native justice concepts and methods. Tribal courts have only recently adapted and implemented the drug court concept, but Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts are already achieving positive results.

I II I l I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I JUDICIAL MYTH There are many myths which surround and support American courts and their methods of operation. The federal, state and local courts of the United States are built on structures developed in Europe. American judges pride themselves on being objective and rational; removed from subjectivity and the restraints of religion. They profess to give people justice regardless of race, creed, class or gender. Among the symbols which support such professions of impartiality is the figure of Justice, symbolized as a woman with a blindfold, holding out her scales of judgment. Although a woman is the symbol of justice, the American judicial system is in fact based upon patriarchal attitudes, and patriarchy is necessarily linked with the rise of Christianity. Patriarchy prompts control over women so that they are in fact treated adversely as a group. Such treatment is both subtle and overt, and the systematic oppression and genocide of women during the 15th and 16th centuries in witch burning exemplifies the judicial myths which support court systems. Modem courts are tied to the rise of Christianity in the West, and most western court systems are directly or indirectly the product of received Roman law. Burning Times, a video, examines the fundamental relationship between the rise of Christianity and the resulting oppression of women. Women were healers and knew the art of medical treatment with herbs. By the time of consolidation of the modem nation-states in the fitteenth and sixteenth centuries, and modem nationalism, Christianity reached its apex. Male judges, guided and supported by male clergy, used witchcratt as a justification to torture and bum the woman healers, whom they called witches. Genocide directed against them was the manifestation of male domination entrenched in western law. (Genocide is destructive force directed against an identifiable class of people.) The women of the time possessed non-Christian sacred knowledge which was used to heal. I At the same time, men went to the new medical schools which rediscovered healing methods from Greek and Roman times. The issue then became who would control the healing professions. The womens' knowledge came from non-Christian folklore, and the healing discourses in medical schools came from ancient male writers who received the endorsement of male-dominated Christianity. The v most horrible disease of the time was the Black Plague. Previously, women sought herbal cures, but when the Black Plague scoured Europe, men turned to women for them. Woman healers knew herbs to cure the plague (Burning Times). That conflicted with the rise of male dominance in medicine. To better understand how that conflict resulted in the burning of women as witches, there must be an examination of the transition from early matriarchal cultures, sanctioned by female deities, to the early patriarchal culture, dominated by a fierce male deity of the Old Testament. Barbara Mor, in The Great Cosmic Mother, establishes the existence of an original matriarchal system before the rise of patriarchal society: [T]he period 6 - 4000 B.C. [was] the Magnus Annus of the Neolithic Great Goddess .... Women had been at the top of traditional, Neolithic society, but with the shift from religious, magical authority to masculine, military power, their influence collapsed and they became private property in the new trading and raiding society. Mesolithie society may have seen the domestication of animals, and Neolithic society may have seen the domestication of plants, but what the age after the Neolithic sees is the domestication of women by men. Id., at 240. Barbara Mor establishes the Bronze Age as the beginning of the Male Seed (Id.). Patriarchal religions, which knew God as a male, began around 2000 B.C. Mor called Him t the Olympian God; a god who was rigid. That Olympian God lost alchemical properties and was unable to transmute from one energy form to another. That made him rational, aloof and immortal. The mythology about him was that he was born of, or was a product of, his own will and not birth from Sic. Note our perpetuation of the myth by using a capital letter for the male deity. 2 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I a woman. Concepts of rationality and authority, independent of feminine ties, are characteristics which also were the foundation of justice systems. Male dominance in society in a patriarchal system of living was established at the expense of women: In early patriarchy, women's ancient community tasks were turned into slave labor. Women produced the surplus products on which men based their secular power and control. In the next stage of economic development these slave tasks became the industrial occupations of the workers, while the ruling men (and their \"wives\") were exempt from labor. Women's forced labor, and later working-class labor, freed elite males to become lawyers, judges, doctors, artists, priests, and warriors--specialized, privileged occupations that all others are barred from. Id., at p. 241. Patriarchy produced a class system based on the belief that labor is secular and separate from religion. In the early matriarchal societies, labor benefitted the Goddess Religion. In the secular patriarchal system, men utilized religion to suppress lower classes and women. Religious doctrine became \"The Law\" as it too lost its religious basis, and ... whole bodies of law, religious doctrine, and custom are then assembled to forcibly maintain these men in these positions of power. Patriarchal law, often called \"the Will of God,\" is in fact a wholly secular cynical legal system designed purposely to maintain male power through institutional control of female energy. Under patriarchal legal, religious, and economic-social systems, some men dominate others. But all men benefit from their organized domination of the community of women. Id. Even the source of food became secular and male-dominated. \"Cattle herds took on a secular aspect: They became symbols of male wealtk power, and potency. (It cannot be an accident that the word \"capitalism\" comes from the Latin caput, or capitellum, originally referring to a head of cattle.)\" Id., at p. 238. Thus, religion, society and the economy fell under male control and those basic elements of group living were dominated by men who used them to control women and subordinate classes. I Men also dominated judicial systems. Systems oflaw come from and mimic the priesthood, another male institution. Mot also shows that the we, stem church essentially shaped the common law of England and dominated legal process for centuries. Before the early fourteenth century in England, lawyers and judges were priests. The clergy of the church became the clerks of the court. It was not until the late thirteenth century that the practice of law was secularized and regularized, and judges began to be selected from outside the church. One need only consider the similarities between a church hall and a court of justice to understand, at least on a superficial level, the influence of this religious institution. The symbols of law, framed by its mythology, closely parallel religious symbols. Priests preside over a sacred altar, and judges announce law as prophets (i.e. as the \"mouthpiece\" of God) from sacred code books. The pomp, circumstance and ceremony of the church left their marks on legal proceedings: The bar of justice in courtrooms is like the communion rail in churches, where there is a dividing line between the audience and the sanctuary. When a judge enters the courtroom, everyone rises, just as everyone stands when the priest enters or he heads a procession to start the ceremony. Legal proceedings have predictable and prescribed forms, similar to religious rites. Judges, like priests, utter fitualized pronouncements which vary according to the proceeding or occasion for ceremony. In one instance, priests and judges may perform the same function, namely united a man and a woman in marriage. (Gonzalcz, Vasquez, and Mikkelson, Fundamentals of Court Interpretation, p. 259). In British courts, the wigs worn by judges and lawyers are symbols of their authority. Men shaved their heads due to lice, and wigs provided warmth and a replacement for a head of hair. The wigs for judges are long, falling down to their waists, to show high authority and power. Lawyers wear shorter wigs to show their subordination, but the wig is a symbol of special power and authority 4 I I I I II I I I I I I I I ! I I I ! I I ! I I I I I I I I I I I i. I I I i not possessed by the laity. A British judge's wig has a hole at the back of the place over the head, and that perpetuates the tonsure of the clergy. The tonsure is a part of the skull which is shaved of hair to show priestly authority. The judicial symbol of office and authority specifically shows the religious and clerical origin of English common law. As it developed, only the clergy could read and write, and the clergy were the original judges and lawyers. There is an English judicial custom (now abandoned in England) which also shows the secularization of a process which was originally religious: When an English judge was about to pronounce the death penalty, a clerk would cover the hole in the back of the wig. That was due to a rule ofcanon law that a priest could not shed blood, so an English judge covered his \"tonsure\" to hide that symbol when ordering the death of a defendant. (Sgt. Pulling, Order of the Coif, p. 359.) Roman law and canon law greatly influenced English law. The Catholic Church took its canon law from Roman law, and canon law was the first modern Western legal system. (Harold J. Berman, Law and Revolution, pp. 199-224.) Canon law had religious elements, including the requirement of marriage and jurisdiction over annulments, and it has secular components, including the foundations of Western political systems. Canon law was the culmination of the Roman Empire and its influence and the transmitter of the Roman legal system. (Id. p. 50.) Another element which shows both the transition from religion to secular practice and the secularization of religious functions is language. Latin was the language of the Church, and it developed in seven periods: Late Latin, Medieval Latin, Low Latin, Vulgar Latin, New Latin, and Law Latin. Legal codes and documents were written in Latin for approximately one thousand years. Seventy-five percent of English words come from Latin. Legal terms still use non-Anglicized Latin phrases. They include \"action\" instead of lawsuit; \"consideration\" to mean a benefit to a \"promisor;\" i \"counterpart\" for a duplicate of a document; and \"executed\" instead of signed. While legal practitioners and scholars struggle to demystify the language of law, their efforts are to no avail. (Cnsrtzales, et al,. 2 p. 259.) A curious symbol of the transition fiom religious to secular discourse is the use of the symbol ofjusaice: A blindfolded woman who holds up scales. Secular authorities adopted female goddess symbols of abstract qualities, such as history, the arts and law. The blindfold of goddess Justice is a symbol of fairness, impartiality and a lack of bias. Justice is seen as a female quality, because \"justice depended on the feminine nature principle, which has a profounder kinship .with the nature instum than does the male sex, with its greater susceptibility to the principle of domination.\" (Barbara G. Walker, The Woman's Enevclooedia of Mvths and Secrets, p. 484.) An earlier incarnation of Justice was the Goddess Libra, who was worshipped in Carthage. \"The blind-fold on today's Goddess of Justice was unknown in antiquity. She not only held the scales of every man's fate; she also had the All-Seeing Eye.\" Id., p. 538. Libra's symbol, which is still used in astrology, is the scales, and today they represent the \"weight\" of an individual's case, with a winner and a loser. The blindfold put on Justice by patriarchy strips her of her power. Today, She is a representation of the fairness which is said to be the aspect of the American judicial system. The manipulation of a symbol which had its origins in female religion parallels other changes in gender relationships. Prior to the Medieval era and the Inquisition, according to the video Burning Times, men and women worked side-by-side. Humans saw themselves as being in equality with nature and honored that kind ofrelationship by celebrating the change of seasons. They would dance to bring on spring and with it new crops and the renewal of life. Christmas has its origins in ancient recognition of the Sic. We still use Latin for citation cues and academic communication. 6 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I ! i I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I i I return of longer days (as do many of today's Indian religious ceremonies in New Mexico and Arizona). There were oral traditions of equality in the social order. Originally, people did not believe in hierarchy or male supremacy. There were no elitist groups in egalitarian societies. The social order was tribal, with clan systems oflaw. (Bermart, p. 52.) The original understandings of society as egalitarian were erased in the development of hierarchial systems of law, with class, power and authority wielded by male figures who look to their priestly origins. That hierarchial structure is inherent in the courts ofthe United States, which receive their authority from the Constitution of the United States. The Constitution is the \"Law of the Land,\" and it is the source for the distribution and delegation of power to the federal government and the states. (Gonzalez, p. 96.) The \"justice\" which is administered in American courtrooms is the end product of a series of historical incidents which melted cultures, languages and traditions to create what we have today. (Id., p. 258.) However, the American culture also took from other, non-European, cultures, languages and traditions and it continues to confront a system of law which retains original understandings: Indian law. Donald A. Grinde and Bruce Johansen demonstrate, in their book, Exemplar of Liberty_, that the \"Founding Fathers\" of the United States borrowed some Native American political concepts and symbols for the United States Constitution and the institutions of the American Republic. They frequently borrowed aspects and symbols of native cultures which suited the needs of the time and their desire for political liberty. Native American thought and institutions shaped American beliefs and resulting actions, whether or not the non-Indian founders understood native political and cultural systems in a scientific sense. (Id., p. xviii.) The GreatSeal of the United States incorporates Indian elements, and it is a symbol of the federal judicial system. The seal shows an eagle clutching thirteen arrows and an olive branch. The 7 ! arrows have their source in a meeting between twelve colonies and leaders of the Iroquois Confederacy in 1775. The symbol comes from the Great Law of the Iroquois, which describes an eagle clutching five arrows to symbolize the pow.er and unity of the Iroquois Confederacy. (Id., p. xxi.) The eagle has twelve tail feathers, and twelve jurors sit to decide cases on triai. Twelve is an ancient symbol, shared by many cultures. There were twelve disciples of Christ, and Navajos believe there are twelve divine personages who come at dawn to bless those who are ready to receive the necessities for survival. Navajos also see the eagle as the symbol of the Law of Nature. Most Native Americans believe that the eagle represents foresight, prudence, wisdom and Indian sovereignty. One of the borrowings from Indian culture in American government is that the \"Americans shared the belief of the Iroquois that people should be governed under a fixed corpus of laws.\" (Id, p. ,~od.) While that is a mutual understanding and belief of American law, there is a great divergence in the application of law. American law is the product of patriarchy, while Indian law still retains its original matriarchal foundations to a large extent. One of the continuing practices of patriarchy is code books. When witches, actually wise women, were burned, judges who presided in tribunals used hand books to prompt confessions and determine the degree of punishment. \"The Inquisition's handbook, Malleus Manleficarum, said the accused witch must be \"often and frequently exposed to tortureY (Walker, p. 442.) Today's hand book is the 1985 United States Sentencing Guidelines, which are used to determine the nature and length of sentence imposed on persons who are found guilty of a crime. Hand books were used to target women as \"witches,\" and today's sentencing guidelines give the United States the highest imprisonment rate in the world, mostly members of racial and ethnic minorities. There are two parallel systems of law in the United States: one is patriarchal and the other 8 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I is largely matriarchal. The patriarchal system is based upon power and authority; wealth and class. The matriarchal system is based upon deliberation and discussion; sharing and equality. The Navajo justice system demonstrates the differences. As has been shown, Western law comes largely from male-dominated religious traditions which were secularized. In it, a powerful authority figure -a judge- hears the arguments of the parties and makes a decision for them. It is an absolute win-lose decision. Judgements are said to be guided by impartial standards, i.e. code books and printed legal case decisions. There is an unequal relationship between the judge and the parties before the court, and the judge holds all the power. The.courts, which are institutions, are built on hierarchies of power. That is alien to Navajo thought. A great deal of Navajo thought comes from the conceptualization of life as a female quality. The principle Navajo deity is Changing Woman, and through Her, Navajo justice is based upori egalitarian norms and principles. The teachings of Changing Woman stress equality, balance and reciprocity, and those elements are reflected in Navajo legal practice. In traditional Navajo law, the \"judge\" is the parties themselves, and decisions are reached through discussion, deliberation and consensus. They do not declare a \"winner\" or a \"loser.\" Navajos speak of a conflict as a problem, and they call their judicial procedure \"talking things out.\" They do not refer to code books. A decision is not made by a powerful authority figure, who relies upon supposedly objective standards published in a law book, but by the people themselves. The closest parallel to a \"judge\" in Navajo law is a community leader who guides and teaches parties. That leader does not make a decision for others, but uses the traditional wisdom which he or she possesses to teach those who are in conflict to help guide their decision. This contrast in legal process is important to show the divergent origins and elements of legal i process. The Economic and Social Council of the United Nations is currently undertaking a study of the nature of treaties, agreements and other arrangements between states and their indigenous populations. The study, which is being conducted by Dr. Miguel Alfonso Martinez of Cuba, produced his First Progress Report (1992). In it, Martinez recognizes that the principle of reciprocity t underlies indigenous law, government and economic relationships. (Dr. Miguel Alfonso Martinez, Study on Treaties. Am'cements and Other Constructive Arrarmements between States and Indigenous w Populations: First Pro m'ess Report, pp. 16-17.) Unlike Western law and government, reciprocity, \"the return of a counter value,\" \"creates a relationship between persons or groups, while identifying the latter as separate members of that relationship.\" Reciprocity recognizes the diversity of individuals within the unity of the group. Capitalism is a central element of Western thought, but in indigenous economic organization, \"reciprocity has been set off against redistribution (implying centralization) and market exchange (implying the establishment of prices), or conceived of by degrees.\" (ld.) Reciprocity, which is taught by Changing Woman, is essential in Navajo legal thought and process. Where reciprocal relationships are established and are as they should be, Navajos describe that state of being as hozho. Following the legal process of\"talking things out,\" where disputants and their advisors reach consensus to solve the underlying problem, the parties reach that state and describe it as hozho naha~ii, which recognizes that hozho has been reached. Navajos also believe in distributive justice, which means that available material goods are shared on the basis of availability and need in such reciprocal relationships. Navajos do not rely upon code books. Everyone possesses the wisdom and knowledge which is used to guide a dispute. The wisdom is ceremonial, and the values of the Navajo culture are enshrined in its language, origin explanations, and stories. An individual who does not possess such 10 I I I II I I I I I I II I li I l I I I ! I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I knowledge can learn it in the legal process from a guide; a civil leader called a naat'aanii. The institution of the naat'aanii is important, and it is an example of the inclusion of women in the institutional process, as contrasted with their exclusion from Western legal institutions up to modern times. A Navajo naat'aanii is chosen through the consensus of the community, otten on the basis of t the possession of religious knowledge. The people choose their leaders for wisdom and demonstrated ability to plan for group success and survival. Navajos understand that women possess special knowledge and wisdom. Women are also healers; most oiten \"hand-tremblers\" and herbalists. In Navajo belief~ hand-trembler, who is a medical diagnostician and \"trembles\" her hand over a patient, is guided by a special Spirit who imparts the intuition needed for a successful diagnosis of an illness and advice on the proper healing ceremony or herb to be used to heal it. Similarly, women have always been understood to have leadership qualities based in intuition. They are often selected as naat'aanii out of recognition of the quality. Intuition, a human quality which is valuable to solve problems, is part of the Navajo process of discussion for resolution in consensus. Intuition guides perception, and it is a quality which can be used to guide parties in conflict. Intuition is a filter to identify shared group values to apply to a problem. In the Navajo process of \"talking things out,\" everyone present identifies the common values and understandings which all share. Navajos are practical. They honor tradition, but know that traditional understandings are based upon centuries of trial and error, and resulting understandings ofsuc, cessful ways of doing things. One such traditional concept is k'e, which has no adequate translation into English. Among many things, it means respect and reciprocity, and it is a value which prompts reciprocity in relationships. It too is among the teachings of Changing Woman. As a female deity figure is used in Western law as the symbol of Justice, Changing Woman is the 11 ! Navajo justice figure. There is also a divergence in the use of symbols in Western and Navajo law. In Western law, \"Justice\" is only a symbol, and while a female figure is used to exemplify the application of law for justice, female knowledge does not guide the process. In contrast, Changing Woman is a symbol, but She is more than that. To Navajos, Changing Woman is Mother Earth. She is the source of knowledge and wisdom, including reciprocal relationships. Reciprocal relationships are egalitarian, and has been shown, Western law is based upon wealth and class distinctions and not equality. How does Navajo law work in practice when it comes to the treatment of women and matriarchal understandings7 Navajo women are recovering from over a century of patriarchal thought imposed upon Navajos in law and government. The traditional Navajo legal system was assaulted in 1892, when Western law was imposed upon the Navajo Nation. Despite the introduction of Western-styled forms and procedures, traditional Navajo law and procedure survived. They were reinstitutionalized in the Navajo Nation court system in 1982. According to the Hen. Elbridge Coochise, president of the National American Indian Court Judges Association, most American tribal judges are women. In the Navajo Nation, half the trial judges are women and all the judges in the New Mexico portion of the Navajo Nation are women. There is a greater percentage of women in the Navajo Nation Bar Association than any other American bar organization. Navajo Nation court personnel say that most of the peacemakers in today's Navajo Peacemaker program are women. Additionally, they also report that in situations involving domestic violence, Navajo women prefer the traditional peacemaking procedure to recent Navajo Nation domestic violence legislation based upon general American procedures. It is taking a long time for Navajos to recover from the imposed legacy of paternalistic law 12 I I I I I I i I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 1 and its symbols. Rape was once almost absent from Navajo society; today it is one of the largest categories of offenses prosecuted in the federal courts of the Southwest. Navajo traditional law strongly prohibits violence against women, yet today it is a common problem on the dockets of the Navajo Nation courts. The Navajo judicial system has imported code book provisions to deal with the social problems of sex offenses, domestic violence, alcohol-related crime (including behaviors which are destructive of others and self-destructive acts, such as suicide), gang activity and other social problems. The Navajo Nation courts use the paternalistic methods and symbols of Western law, but its judges and the Navajo People prefer their traditional and female-based law. That is shown by the popularity and increasing use of Navajo peacemaking in the court system. While Western law is the core of most American tribal courts, it is not working. That is shown by the statistics of higher rates of homicide, family violence and suicide in Indian Country as compared to general American rates. (Ronet Bachman, Death and Vi\u00a2lcnce on the Reservption.) It is di~cult to interpret those rates, but one explanation may be that paternalistic law is not working. Traditional Indian law is based upon equality, consensus and reciprocal relationships; ideas which come from female traditions. Western law was introduced to destroy Indian traditional law, and perhaps it did its job too well. Western law substituted authoritarian structures and rules for egalitarian ones and it took power out of the hands of the people. It also stripped them of competence to solve their own problems. We must examine the myths by which we live. The judicial myth of objectivity and equality before the law is exposed in an examination of its paternalistic origins and its disparate impact upon women. A comparison between the workings of Western law and the Law of Changing Woman shows that there are two systems of law which function in the United States: one is essentially 13 I authoritarian, and the other is based in egalitarian process and thought. The United States made a conscious choice of the law to be used in the new American Republic. It recognized the existence of Indian government and law and chose only a few elements and symbols of Indian law. As Grinde and Johansen relate, the American Founding Fathers t consciously recognized the existence of Indian law, and some of its principles, but only took from it what suited them. America had Founding Fathers. The Navajo Nation had a Founding Mother, and the Navajo treaty negotiators spoke of Her when they concluded their Treaty of 1868 with the United States. Grinde and Johansen hint that the American Founding Fathers flirted with the idea of rejecting English common law in favor of a system of Indian law. Thomas Jefferson, who despised Sir William Blackstone (whose Commentaries on the Law of England were the basis of the American system), talked about using Indian law for the United States. John Adams, who also spoke of his familiarity with Indian law, was not prepared to reject the authority-based law of Europe. His position may be due to his rearing in Puritan religion and principles. The American Revolution was conducted by male leadership, and the new Republic was formed and framed by men who were steeped in paternalistic European thought. While there are many positive elements in Christian thought, the historical rejection of female deities and the ironic adoption of one of them as the symbol of justice resulted in genocide and atrocities against distinct groups of people. Women were the primary victims of paternalistic control in male-dominated authority structures, and they are still victimized by the law. While today women are not the primary occupants of prisons, minority males are. The class structure of American law is visible in the statistics which shows what happens when the law is applied to people. 14 I ! I i I I I I I I I I I I I I I I i I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I There is an alternative. Navajo peacemaking has been taken around the world, and Navajo court officials have visited Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Fiji, Canada, Bolivia and South Africa to explain how it works, Recently, the United States Justice Department announced that there will be a major conference in Washington, D.C. in January 1996 to explore \"restorative justice \"3 and how it works in traditional Indian law. The female traditions of equality and reciprocity are recognized in a major United Nations study of indigenous treaties. Justice should not be a myth. Judicial systems should not fianction using mythology when they are in fact based upon paternalistic class distinctions. The problem with legal systems based upon authority is that they too easily become authoritarian. The Navajo experience shows that it is possible to return to original understandings of true equality and true justice, using procedures which prompt consensus and agreement. Navajo law comes from a woman, and She is not merely a symbol. Changing Woman is our law. In the United States, the myth continues. 3 Restorative justice is a recent theory that it is possible to deal with offenses using alternatives to punishment. 15 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 7 th Indian Nations Conference Overview of a Cross Cultural Curriculum for Federal Criminal Justice Personnel Dolores Subia BigFoot, PhD Tulsa, Oklahoma 1999 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I Upon the Back of a I Turtle... | A Cross Cultural Training Curriculum for | Federal Criminal Justice Personnel I I I I I I Center on Child Abuse and Neglect I University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center Department of Pediatrics CHO 3B-3406 I P.O.

A Cross Cultural Training Curriculum for Federal Criminal Justice Personnel Purpose of Training The materials and video of this curriculum is designed to assist federal government personnel in understanding the diversity within Indian communities and improve their abilities to provide culturally appropriate services to American Indian clients. The materials will assist federal criminal justice personnel in responding appropriately to American Indian victims of crime and their families and the provision of culturally sensitive services will be enhanced. Upon the Back of a Turtle... comes from the rich oral tradition that Native people have for storytelling to teach principles and to convey ideas. Upon the Back of a Turtle uses the same concept of telling a variety of stories. The stories are not meant to portray a specific tribe or Native group, but are told to present different concepts used by Native families and their extended family members. These stories express family relationships, the viability of traditional ceremonies, the use of traditional teachings, methods of communication and other relevant themes. The vignettes are only short tales and are not one consistent story line, but they are the portrayal of concepts to generate discussion among the viewers and to convey a bit of teaching with the telling of the tale. Organization of the Manual The contents of this curriculum have been organized in training modules that can be presented either as a series of workshops or as an individual module. The training modules have been designed so that the presenter has all necessary information for each session and in a format that can be easily presented. Each trainer's module includes a trainer's agenda, presentation information, master overheads, master handouts, and activity worksheets. The Trainer's Agenda includes lecture presentation (overall goal of the session), objectives, activities for large and small groups, discussion questions and information that relates to the training video for each section. Each session can last from 1 - 3 hours, depending upon the activity selected and amount of discussion within the group. Suggested readings are included at the end of the manual that can be disseminated to participants and can also assist the presenter in preparing for the presentation. Each module includes the Presentation Information with specific information on each topic to be covered during the session. Within the Presentation Information are master overheads that can be copied onto transparencies to be used during each session.

The video can be used at any point in this training program. Introduction In recent years, federal employees have been working with Native American victims of crime in increasing numbers. In 1989, the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) within the Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, began funding on-reservation programs through the Victim Assistance in Indian Country (VAIC) discretionary grant program. As increasing numbers of Indian victims of crime have come into the criminal justice system, U.S. Attorneys, Federal Victim/Witness Coordinators, FBI Agents, and other federal personnel who are predominantly non- Indian, have encountered cultural differences in working with Native American crime victims. This curriculum and video will present some of the realities of the delivery of services to Native victims by victim assistance programs with the goal of increasing understanding of how VAIC programs may differ from similar non-Indian programs. Any discussion of Native programs must begin with the caveat that all tribes are different and that there is no single correct way to deal with all Indian persons and/or programs. Non-Indian personnel working within Indian Country must educate themselves regarding the Indian Nations in their jurisdiction. In this curriculum and video the term Native Americans and American Indians are used interchangeably. Both terms are used to describe the Native American, American Indian, Alaska Native and Eskimo populations.

A Cross Cultural Training Curriculum for Federal Criminal Justice Personnel Upon the Back of a Turtle there are many stories... Storytelling was the form of transmittal for how things were and why things happened. There were winter stories and summer stories, stories for days that the rains fell, and stories for early mornings. Creation stories were told and retold many times in the growing years. The telling of the tale was not only to re-create the beginning of the tribe but the stories would have different significance as children matured through the developmental stages. Storytelling gathered families together to share recreation time and to improve listening and oratory skills. Stories provided the answers to when, where, how, and how come. Non-Indian youth have Dr. Seuss, Charlie Brown and other stories to grow and mature by. Indian youth have turtle stories, songs, and games they listen to as they mature from youth into adulthood. Each turtle story has a lesson and is used as a teaching tool for American Indian youth. \"Upon the Back of a Turtle\" video is a representation of cultural differences in the way Native teachings are still used today. \" I ~ ponsored by the Office for Victims of Crime, Contract # 96-VR-GX-0002 Copyright \u00a9 CCAN, OUHSC, 1998 viii I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 7 th Indian Nations Conference Juveniles in the Federal Court System Arvo Mikkanen, JD Tulsa, Oklahoma 1999 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 7 th Indian Nations Conference I I I I I I I I I I I I I I \"Juveniles in the Federal Court System\" Arvo Mikkanen, JD i Learning Objectives: 1.

OVERVIEW OF FEDERAL INDIAN LAW: Federal Indian law is the body of federal law that concerns the unique status and rights of Indian tribes and individual Indians or Native Americans in our legal system. Federal Indian law includes many different categories including jurisdiction, taxation, environmental regulation, civil rights, housing, hunting & fishing, gaming, domestic relations, property, constitutional law, criminal law, and civil-regulatory law, to name a few. A. SOME BASIC CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS: 1. LEGAL STATUS OF INDIAN NATIONS OR TRIBES: a) Indian nations or tribes are governments, not just collections of individuals. b) Under case law, Indian nations retain the powers of a foreign nation except those extinguished by Congress, by treaty, or which are \"inconsistent with the dependent status of the tribes.\" c) Tribal nations retain jurisdiction or governmental authority over those lands remaining which are designated as \"Indian country.\" d) Tribes may continue to exercise powers of a sovereign. Under the doctrine of tribal sovereignty an Indian tribe, may exercise the following powers, among others: 1) Form a government 2) Determine tribal membership (or citizenship) 3) Regulate tribal property 4) Regulate individually owned property 5) Tax Indians & non-lndians 6) Maintain law & order and court systems 7) Regulate activities of non-Indians 8) Regulate domestic relations 9) Regulate commerce and trade A tribe generally retains other sovereign powers, consistent with its status as a \"domestic dependent nation\" unless its powers have been specifically divested by treaty or Act of Congress. e) The power exercised by an Indian tribe does not flow from the United States or the State government, but rather originates from the inherent sovereignty of the tribe. I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 2. THE DEFINITION OF \"INDIAN COUNTRY\" The lands over which tribal and federal jurisdiction generally control, and over which the Indian nation may exercise its sovereign authority. As a general matter, state jurisdiction over Indian country lands is limited or restricted depending upon the type of matter involved and the identity/citizenship over whom the jurisdiction is being asserted. a) The federal statute defining Indian country is 18 United States Code, Section 1151 (a), (b), & (c): Except as otherwise provided in sections 1154 and 1156 of this title, the term \"Indian country,\" as used in this chapter, means (a) all land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States government, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and including rights- of-way running through the reservation, (b) all dependent Indian communities within the borders of the United States whether within the original or subsequently acquired territory thereof, and whether within or without the limits of a state, and (c) all Indian allotments, the Indian titles to which have not been extinguished, including rights-of-way running through the same. 3. \"INDIAN\" AS A LEGAL STATUS The special status or rights of Indians are derived from their status as citizens or members of an Indian nation, not just from their racial status of having Indian blood. a) With a few exceptions, membership in a federally recognized Indian tribe is based upon the tribe's own laws and constitution. 1) The tribe retains the right to determine its members or who may be citizens 2) Tribal membership or citizenship is usually a prerequisite to a party receiving services from the tribe 3) The tribal membership/citizenship status of an individual may also have jurisdictional consequences - e.g. a tribe may not be able to assert criminal jurisdiction over (be able to arrest, charge or punish) a non-Indian - e.g. an order of the Court of Indian Offenses cannot be imposed against a non-lndian unless they have stipulated to the jurisdiction of the court under 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 11.103 (a). b) Indians maintain a \"triple citizenship\" being a citizen of a state, and Indian nation, and the United States, all at the same time. 1) The fact that an Indian may have rights as a tribal member does not deprive them of other rights they may possess as citizens of the State of Oklahoma or the United States. I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I II. OBTAINING RESTRAINING ORDERS AND CIVIL JUDICIAL RELIEF THROUGH THE TRIBAL COURT SYSTEMS Generally, since state courts do not have authority over Indian country lands or in matters where the parties involved reside within Indian country, it may be necessary to obtain restraining orders or seek other judicial relief to protect persons from violence through the tribal court systems. 1. BACKGROUND OF THE TRIBAL COURT SYSTEMS IN OKLAHOMA: a) most court systems are relatively new (established within the last ten or fifteen years) - although tribes in Oklahoma had sophisticated tribal courts prior to statehood, those courts have not been re-established until recent times - most tribal courts in Oklahoma have been established following the decision in State v. Linlechief, where the state and federal courts determined that Oklahoma does not have jurisdiction over felony crimes committed by Indians on Indian allotments classified as Indian country under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151(c). b) some tribes have not yet enacted comprehensive codes of laws and rules of procedure concerning the presentation of matters in the tribal court - the tribal codes which have been adoped usually set forth the particular requirements for such matters as obtaining a tribal court restraining order, defining the criminal offenses for the tribe, or the procedure to use in handling the case before the court. - tribes without their own tribal code may rely on the tribal code (laws) of another jurisdiction (e.g. another tribe, the state, the United States) c) most tribal courts operate on a part-time basis and may have court from as often as 2 times a week to as infrequently as once a month d) most tribal courts have practicing attorneys who serve as judges and are available at the court only on a part time basis d) obtaining protective orders or restraining orders may require additional steps when compared with the state court systems due to the part time nature of the court systems e) few, if any tribes, have enacted \"Victim Protection Order\" or ('VPO\") statutes or procedures, thus, most orders for the protection of individuals are issued are under the court's general authority to issue restraining orders I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I i I I I I I I I I i I I I I 2. AN OVERVIEW OF THE TWO TRIBAL COURT SYSTEMS OPERATING IN OKLAHOMA: THE COURTS OF INDIAN OFFENSES & THE TRIBAL COURTS a) The Courts of Indian Offenses (also known as \"CFR Courts\"): 1) operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs for those tribes without sufficient funds to have their own court system 2) laws applied include the federal regulations found in Title 25, Part 11 of the Code of Federal Regulations, state law, tribal law, and federal law, as well as locally adopted court rules of procedure and administrative orders 3) judges are part-time employees who are attorneys 4) each court is served by a court clerk, who is responsible for filings and record maintenance The Anadarko Area Courts: thai courts: Anadarko Agency Court of lndian Offenses, Anadarko, OK: Indian country under the jurisdiction of the Kiowa, Comanche, Apache, Wichita, Caddo, Western Delaware, Fort Sill Apache Tribes Pawnee Agency Court of Indian Offenses, Ponca City, OK: Indian country under the jurisdiction of the Tonkawa and Ponca Tribes appeals court: Court of Indian Offenses - Appellate Division, Anadarko, OK Hears appeals from the Anadarko Agency and Pawnee Agency Courts of Indian Offenses The Muskogee Area Courts: trial courts: Seminole Agency Court of Indian Offenses, Seminole (Mikasukey Mission), OK: Indian country under the jurisdiction of the Seminole Nation: Miami Agency Court of Indian Offenses, Miami, OK: Indian country under the jurisdiction of the Seneca-Cayuga, Miami, Modoc, Eastern Shawnee, Ottawa, Peoria, Quapaw, Wyandotte Tribes. Chickasaw Agency Court of Indian Offenses, Ada, OK: Indian country under the jurisdiction of the Chickasaw and Choctaw Nations. I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I appeals court: Court of Indian Offenses - Appellate Division: Hears appeals from the Seminole, Miami, and Chickasaw Agency Courts of Indian Offenses b) The Tribal Courts: 1) operated by the Indian tribe itself pursuant to its own laws 2) laws applied include tribal law, state law, and federal law, as well as locally adopted court rules of procedure and administrative orders 3) most judges are part-time employees who are attorneys 4) each court is served by a court clerk, who is responsible for filings and record maintenance Tribes currently operating tribal courts: Comanche (child welfare only) Cheyenne-Arapaho, Sac & Fox, Absentee Shawnee, Iowa, Citizen Band Potawatomi, Kickapoo, Kaw, Otoe-Missouria, Osage, Cherokee, (Muskogee) Creek, Cherokee. 3. PROCEDURE TO OBTAIN A COURT ORDER TO PROTECT INDIVIDUALS FROM DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN INDIAN COUNTRY a) Procedure in Tribal Court: 1. Determine the status of the land where the parties reside -Is it Indian country? - if NO, then victim protection order should be sought through state court, which would have subject matter and personal jurisdiction over the matter. - If YES, then restraining order should be sought through tribal court which would have subject matter and personal jurisdiction over the matter I I I I I ! I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 2. Determine which tribe has governmental authori~' over that land (in which tribe \u00b0s original reservation boundaries is the land located?). - this usually will determine which tribal court has jurisdiction over the land. 3. Determine the status of the individual(s) to be restrained. (Indian or non-Indian ?) - If the tribe is served by a Court of Indian Offenses, and individual to be restrained is a non-Indian, a party must allege and prove that the defendant has stipulated to the jurisdiction of the court. See 25 C.F.R \u00a7 11.103 (a). - If the tribe is served by a tribal court and the defendant is a non- Indian, check the tribal codes to confirm that non-Indians are subject to tribal court jurisdiction. In most cases they should be subject to the civil authority of the tribal court, even if they are non-lndian or are non-tribal members. 4. Determine the court's filing procedures. - Contact the tribal court or the Court of Indian Offenses for the tribe that has jurisdiction over the property to determine the filing procedures, to find out when court will next be held, whether judge can sign order faxed to him or her, filing fees, etc. 5. Prepare a petition for a restraining order or victim protection order. - The petition should be prepared in compliance with the court's procedural codes and rules, which may require an affidavit, signature of a notary, or signature of the petition by the court clerk (check whether the court will accept a fill in the blank form). The petition should adequately describe the facts, circumstances, and specific reasons why that the order should be issued. 6. File petition with filing fee. - Completed petition should be filed in the appropriate court and a filing fee paid (if one is required). Service on the opposing parties must be made in accordance with tribal court procedural rules (e.g. service by law enforcement, process server, mail, etc.). I i I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I i . I ! I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 7. Determine if order can be issued immediately \"ex pane\" (without the other side present or having responded). - Most courts, if advised of the emergency nature of the request, will be able to immediately issue a TRO or protection order.
