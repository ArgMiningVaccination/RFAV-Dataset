It delivers all the nutrients your newborn needs in the right amounts, and it's easy to digest. Another bonus: breast milk helps strengthen your baby's immune system. Here are more amazing facts about breastfeeding, immunity and your child's health. Breast milk: healthy nutrition and infection resistance, all in one Breast milk provides your baby with [antibodies](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22971-antibodies) that help fight infection. The first milk that that comes out of breasts after giving birth-known as [colostrum](/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Colostrum-Your-Babys-First-Meal.aspx)-is especially rich in antibodies. As you continue to nurse, your baby will take in more antibodies, which helps them resist illness and infection now and in the future. A closer look at breast milk's superpowers Along with antibodies, breast milk delivers proteins, fats, sugars and even white blood cells that work to fight infection in many ways. As breast milk enters your baby's system, infection-fighting elements work with your baby's intestine even before nutrients are broken down and absorbed into the bloodstream. The result is a more balanced immune system that helps your child's body recognize and fight illness more effectively. Other elements in breast milk directly stimulate and support your baby's immune response, too. These include lactoferrin and interleukin-6, -8 and -10, proteins that help moderate the inflammatory response that happens when your immune system encounters a threat\u2014for example, a virus or bacterial infection. Inflammation is a natural part of immune functioning, but too much inflammation can be harmful, so keeping things balanced is essential for your child's health. Breast milk's natural probiotics for a healthy microbiome You may have heard about [probiotics](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/probiotics/faq-20058065), the \"good\" bacteria that are present in the healthy digestive systems of kids and adults. These useful bacteria strengthen your child's immune response by offsetting the growth of unfriendly organisms that can cause infections and inflammation. Breastfeeding gives your baby a steady supply of probiotics, strengthening their [gut microbiome](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/microbiome/). Research suggests that this, in turn, reduces risks for chronic health conditions including: Studies also show that breastfed babies are less likely to suffer from infections such as: In addition, research reveals that children who nurse for 6+ months are less likely to develop childhood [leukemia and lymphoma](/English/health-issues/conditions/cancer/Pages/Childhood-Cancer.aspx) than formula-fed children. This may be because these two types of cancer, which affect the blood, are linked with disruptions to a child's immune system. Breastfeeding is healthy for nursing parents, too The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) [recommends](/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Where-We-Stand-Breastfeeding.aspx) breastfeeding as the healthiest way to feed newborns and infants. With the right resources and support, most parents who choose to breastfeed will be able to successfully manage any challenges they encounter.
