Some minor males may have beards and mustaches. Some may have bald or shaved heads. Some minor males are big, which may make them appear older. Some minors will make direct eye contact with you while lying about their age. Some minor females may wear makeup or clothing that makes them appear older. However, keep in mind that some minors might appear nervous, may not make eye contact with you, may not have facial hair, or may have smooth, unlined faces. Ask the customer to hand you the ID so you can closely examine it. Look for signs that the ID has been tampered with. Some signs are: irregular laminations; anything other than a smooth surface; bumpy or raised surfaces by the picture; cuts anywhere on the ID; changes to birth dates, expiration dates or \"minor until\" dates. Look at the printing type on the ID. Do all letters and numbers appear the same? Compare the picture on the ID to the person before you. Do they look the same? Does the physical description on the ID match the person standing before you? (Remember that weight and hair may change, but height rarely will.) Check the expiration date. If the ID has expired, it is unacceptable.ALASKA MARIJUANA HANDLER CERTIFICATION COURSE 101-AK | 5 Check for a signature. Do not accept without a signature. Without giving the person the ID, ask them some quesitons. Examples: What is your address? What is the zip code? Spell your middle name. What is your date of birth? Ask their age. Ask when they graduated from high school. An important thing to remember is that minors come in all shapes and sizes. Think about it. You cannot tell by a person's face, clothes or behavior alone how old the person may be. Help eliminate the guesswork: Don't sell unless you're sure!

Description of the cannabis plant and illicit cannabis products 3.1 NameALASKA MARIJUANA HANDLER CERTIFICATION COURSE 101-AK | 2 Cannabis sativa L. (Linnaeus) 3.2 Synonyms There are many local and street names and synonyms used for cannabis and it is beyond the scope of this manual to list them all. They include: * [10]. 3.4 Physical appearance Cannabis is an annual, dioecious,* flowering herb. Staminate (male) plants are usually taller but less robust than pistillate (female) plants. Stems are erect and can vary from 0.2-6 m. However, most of the plants reach heights of 1-3 m. The extent of branching, like the plant height, depends on environmental and hereditary factors as well as the method of cultivation (see also section 5.3.1). *The majority of plants is dioecious (i.e. male and female flowers are found on separate plants), although monoecious plants (i.e. bearing both male and female flowers) may also be encountered. 3.6 Breeding The plant is best suited to well structured neutral to alkaline clay and loam soils, with good water-holding capacity, which are not subject to water logging. Among many trials of breeding, crossing sativa and indica strains led to the develop- ment of \"skunk\", a hybrid said to be 75 per cent sativa and 25 per cent indica. This strain is said to be one of the first which combines the high THC content of C. sativa subsp. sativa with the rapid growth cycle and yield of C. sativa subsp. indica. In some countries, cannabis with a high THC content is generally referred to as \"skunk\" today. 3.6.2 Cloning The first and most obvious boost to sinsemilla production was the use of clones. Cloning simply means propagating from a successful \" mother \" plant . This cutting is rooted and transplanted. It is a genetic duplicate of its mother and thus can be used to create even more cuttings. A square metre of mother plants can provide numerous clones a week. 3.6.4 Outdoor productionALASKA MARIJUANA HANDLER CERTIFICATION COURSE 101-AK | 3 The main production of cannabis worldwide is still outdoors and these plants are generally but not necessarily grown from seeds. Outdoor sinsemilla production is realized by identifying and destroying male plants before pollination or by the use of artificially induced hermaphroditic females (see section 3.6.3). 3.6.5 Indoor production Growing cannabis from seed means that half of the crop might be unwanted male plants. For cost-intensive greenhouse production this is usually avoided, which can be achieved easily by cloning. Cloning and indoor production go hand in hand . Indoor production is mainly encountered in technologically advanced coun- tries, where big basements or closed factories are usually used. One or more rooms in houses or other dwellings are also frequently converted into grow rooms often using hydroponic techniques, i.e. growing plants in nutrient solutions instead of soil. In soil, the optimum pH for the plant is 6.5 to 7.2. In hydroponic growing, the nutrient solution is best at 5.2 to 5.8, making cannabis well-suited to hydroponics, and thus indoor production, because this pH range is hostile to most bacteria and fungi [19]. An example and overview of trends in illicit cannabis cultivation in the United Kingdom, including relevant legal and forensic implications, can be found in [20]. 3.7 Industrial cannabis Industrial cannabis (industrial hemp) comprises a number of varieties of Cannabis sativa L. that are intended for agricultural and industrial purposes. They are grown for their seeds and fibres . Industrial cannabis is characterized by low THC content and high cannabidiol ( CBD) content. In most European countries the current upper legal limit for cultivation is 0.2 per cent THC (Canada: 0.3 per cent). The ratio of CBD to THC is greater than one. In many countries, \"lists of approved cultivars\" exist. Varieties which are consistently found to exceed the legally acceptable levels for THC may be removed from these lists. Harvesting for fibres occurs at the end of flowering of the female plants and before seed formation.ALASKA MARIJUANA HANDLER CERTIFICATION COURSE 101-AK | 4 3.8 Flowering Flowering usually starts when darkness exceeds eleven hours per day . The flowering cycle can last anywhere between four and twelve weeks , depending on the strain and environmental conditions. Flowering times given by seed companies usually refer to the time taken to flower when grown from seed. Plants grown from cuttings can take a week or so longer to finish flowering. 3.9 Harvesting A good sign of ripeness is the colour of the hair-like structures (stigmas). As each flower ripens, these usually shrivel and turn brown . When about 75 per cent of the stigmas are brown , the plants are ready to harvest . 3.10 Yield Mean and/or minimal yield estimates are of forensic and legal interest. However, yield estimates are difficult , strongly dependent on cultivar/breed, cultivation technique , nutrition, light intensity, duration and rhythm, etc. Studies undertaken in Australia and New Zealand have shown that yields from indoor and outdoor grown plants are so variable that it is not meaningful to apply a set formula for wet : dry : saleable material or grams per plant or square metre.* Nevertheless, some empirical studies are available and summarized below. Variations due to different cultivation factors as mentioned above have to be considered. 3.13 Cannabis products Cannabis has been used as an agricultural crop for textile fibres for centuries. Other legitimate cannabis products include cannabis seed, cannabis seed oil and the essen- tial oil of cannabis. Illicit cannabis products fall into three main categories: resin and liquid cannabis ( cannabis oil ). It must be stressed that no two illicit cannabis products have identical physical appearances. Produced from a highly variable natural product using a batch process capable of wide variation, and subsequently subjected to processing and transformation for trafficking purposes, cannabis products appear in illicit markets in a multitude of forms. 3.13.1 Herbal cannabisALASKA MARIJUANA HANDLER CERTIFICATION COURSE 101-AK | 5 It is still the traditional belief that only the fruiting and flowering tops and leaves next to the flowering tops contain significant quantities of the psychoactive consti- tuent ( THC); they are known as the \"drug-containing parts\", and generally it is only these parts of the plant that are sold in the illicit market (B in figure 1, page 8). Indeed, these parts contain the highest amount of THC. However, illicitly consumed herbal cannabis also includes bigger leaves located at greater distance from the flowering tops. Also the leaves next to the male flowering tops of potent cannabis plants contain consumable amounts of THC. However, the content is much lower than that for female plants and they are therefore not material of first choice. The central stem and main side stems contain little THC but they may still be used in the production of cannabis oil. The dried leaves and flowers of the cannabis plant are known as \"marihuana\", and a plethora of other regional names exist [10]. \"Marihuana\" is found in the illegal market unchanged, i.e. raw from the plant (also called \"dried flower\"), processed as compressed slabs or coins, or as ground up material. The presentation of the herbal material in illicit markets varies widely, from region to region as well as within the countries of each region. High quality product can be made by sieving crushed herbal cannabis to remove those parts of the plant which contain relatively low levels of, or no, cannabinoids. Essentially, this removes seeds and all but the most insignificant stem material. All that passes through the sieving process has been derived from the flowering and fruiting tops' herbal material, therefore a relative enrichment of THC occurs. In the illicit traffic, the product is known as \"Kief\". It is a characteristic product of North Africa. Such material has high cannabis resin content and can be compressed into slabs, which bear some physical resemblance to cannabis resin slabs (hashish). How- ever, when subjected to microscopic examination, such slabs are found to have retained essential herbal characteristics (see also section 5.3.2), and are considered a sort of \"purified marihuana\". A third, and in some western European countries dominant, way of producing high quality herbal cannabis is indoor production . Very potent hybrids such as \"skunk\", \"white widow\", etc. are generally used and cultivation conditions are optimized . Propagation occurs mainly by cloning of the mother plants (see section 3.6.2); seedlings are seldom encountered anymore. Premises used for indoor cultivation include basements, factories, warehouses and unused portions of commercial or industrial facilities. They are often equipped with automated nutrition and water supply, air conditioning, systems to filter and deodorize outlet air and automated illumination to mimic day and night phases . The combination of ideal growing conditions and high THC cultivars generates products with a maximum THC content which is often two to ten times higher than that observed in the late eighties. Herbal cannabisALASKA MARIJUANA HANDLER CERTIFICATION COURSE 101-AK | 6 with a total THC content of more than 10 per cent, cannabis resin with 25 per cent THC and cannabis oil with 60 per cent THC are not unusual today. The drying process is simple. Either the drug-containing parts are cut off or the entire plant is suspended upside down and air-dried. Drying is complete when the leaves next to flowering tops are brittle. Depending on the humidity and ambient temperature, this takes approximately 24 to 72 hours . The residual water-content in this material is about 8-13 per cent. This material is directly suitable for smoking in a joint and can be stored for many months, although THC degrades with time, when exposed to air, light and humidity. 3.13.2 Cannabis resin (hashish) The resinous secretions of the plant, produced in the glandular trichomes (see sec- tion 5.3.2) can be collected, thus obtaining a higher THC-containing product from which most recognizable plant material is removed. In addition to the secretions, it consists of finer plant material and appears as loose or pressed sticky powder, depending on the method of production. Worldwide, the production of cannabis resin is centred in two main regions. The countries around the southern and the eastern part of the Mediterranean form one region, and the countries in South and South-West Asia form another. A variety of processes have been used in both regions to produce cannabis resin. However, in general, the countries of one region use similar techniques. Sieving is an important part of the process in both regions 3.13.3 Liquid cannabis (hashish oil) Liquid cannabis is a concentrated liquid extract of either herbal cannabis material or of cannabis resin. The reason for the production of liquid cannabis is to concentrate the psychoactive ingredient, THC . This may help traffickers evade interdiction, because more psychoactive material can be contained in a smaller quantity of product. Of equal value to the trafficker is the ability to insert the liquid cannabis into any cavity and to use concealments which cannot easily accommodate herbal or resin cannabis, thereby reducing the possibility of detection by the form or odour of the material.ALASKA MARIJUANA HANDLER CERTIFICATION COURSE 101-AK | 7 Extraction is performed in a suitable vessel with an organic solvent (e.g. petroleum ether, ethanol, methanol, acetone) at room temperature with stirring, by passive extraction or under reflux. When the batch of cannabis or cannabis resin is thought to be fully extracted, the suspension is filtered and the extracted material is discarded. If necessary, a second fresh batch of cannabis material may be placed into the vessel and extracted with the same batch of solvent used for the initial extraction. This process can be repeated as often as required, using a number of batches of cannabis or cannabis resin with a single batch of extracting solvent. After the final batch has been extracted, the solvent is evaporated to obtain the required consistency of the oil. In some clandes- tine laboratories, especially in those countries where organic solvents are expensive or difficult to purchase, the excess solvent may be recovered for future use. In general, liquid cannabis, whether made from cannabis or cannabis resin, is dark brown or dark green in colour and has the consistency of thick oil or a paste . 3.13.4 Cannabis seeds and cannabis seed oil Cannabis seeds are a less well known though potent source of -3-fatty acids. Can- nabis seed oil is a clear yellow liquid. The seed contain approximately 29 per cent to 34 per cent oil by weight [33]. 100 g of cannabis seed oil contains about 19 g -linolenic acid. A ratio of about 3:1 of -6- to -3-fatty acids makes cannabis seed oil a high quality nutrient. However, due to its high proportion of unsaturated fatty acids, this oil tends to get rancid rapidly if not stored in a cool and dark place. Although the seed is enclosed by the bracteole, which is the part of the plant with the highest density of glandular trichomes and thus the highest THC concentration, the seeds themselves do not contain THC. However, they may be contaminated with cannabis materials (e.g. flowering tops, husks, resin), resulting in detectable amounts of THC. Similarly, if THC is detected in cannabis seed oil, it most likely originated from a poor separation of the seeds from the bract [34]. 3.13.5 Cannabis essential oil The essential oil of cannabis is a clear and slightly yellow-coloured liquid . It is obtained by steam distillation of the freshly cut cannabis plants . A great demand for this essential oil does not exist and it seems that it is rather a side product from seed oil or hashish-oil production. The essential oil does not contain THC , but is responsible for the characteristic smell of cannabis products, andALASKA MARIJUANA HANDLER CERTIFICATION COURSE 101-AK | 8 is also the basis for their identification by sniffer dogs. 3 AAC 306.345.

Among many trials of breeding, crossing sativa and indica strains led to the develop- ment of \"skunk\", a hybrid said to be 75 per cent sativa and 25 per cent indica. This strain is said to be one of the first which combines the high THC content Cloning simply means propagating from a successful \" mother \" plant . Cloning and indoor production go hand in hand . Industrial cannabis is characterized by low THC content and high cannabidiol ( CBD) content. Flowering usually starts when darkness exceeds eleven hours per day . When about 75 per cent of the stigmas are brown , the plants are ready to harvest . Illicit cannabis products fall into three main categories: oil ). Cannabis has been used as an agricultural crop for textile fibres for centuries. The drying process approximately 24 to 72 hours . The reason for the production of liquid cannabis is to concentrate the psychoactive ingredient, THC . Any marijuana product sold must state the total estimated amount of THC in the labeled product. A marijuana product manufacturing facility shall use a marijuana inventory tracking system .

Side effects of marijuana use will be variable from person to person , depending upon strength and amount of marijuana used and if the user is occasionally or chronically exposed to THC. The short-term effects of marijuana use include problems with memory and learning ; distorted perception (sights, sounds, time, touch); difficulty in thinking and problem solving ; loss of coordination and motor skills; increased heart rate, anxiety , bloodshot eyes, dry mouth . Reaction time may be impaired while driving. Panic attacks, paranoia and psychosis may occur acutely and be more common in psychiatric patients.10. For chronic users, the impact on memory and learning can last for days or weeks after its acute effects wear off.1 Marijuana may be cut on the street with more dangerous substances that may lead to more serious side effects.ALASKA MARIJUANA HANDLER CERTIFICATION COURSE 101-AK | 2 THC in marijuana is strongly absorbed by fatty tissues in various organs . Generally, traces of THC can be detected by standard urine testing methods several days after a smoking session. In heavy chronic users, traces can sometimes be detected for weeks after they have stopped using marijuana. What are the long-term side effects of Marijuana use? People who smoke marijuana often have the same respiratory problems as cigarette smokers . These individuals may have daily cough and phlegm , symptoms of chronic bronchitis , and more frequent chest colds . They are also at greater risk of getting lung infections like pneumonia . Marijuana contains some of the same , and sometimes even more, of the cancer -causing chemicals found in cigarette smoke . A study from 2009 suggests that regular and long-term use of marijuana may increase the risk for testicular cancer. When people smoke marijuana for years they can suffer negative consequences. For example, because marijuana affects brain function, the ability to do complex tasks could be compromised, as well as the pursuit of academic, athletic, or other life goals that require you to be 100 percent focused and alert. Long-term abuse of marijuana may lead to addiction. Marijuana also may affect mental health. Studies show that early use may increase the risk of developing psychosis (a severe mental disorder in which there is a loss of contact with reality) including false ideas about what is happening (delusions) and seeing or hearing things that aren't there (hallucinations), particularly if you carry a genetic vulnerability to the disease. Also, rates of marijuana use are often higher in people with symptoms of depression or anxiety. Effects of Marijuana On Other Organs Effects on the Heart Shortly after smoking marijuana the heart rate increases drastically and may remain elevated forALASKA MARIJUANA HANDLER CERTIFICATION COURSE 101-AK | 3 up to 3 hours. This effect may be enhanced if other drugs are taken with marijuana. One study has suggested that the risk of heart attack may increase by up to 4.8-fold in the first hour after smoking marijuana.11 The effect may be due to the increased heart rate, as well as altered heart rhythms. The risk of heart attack may be greater in those with specific risk factors such as patients with high blood pressure, heart arrhythmia, or other cariac disease. Effects on the Lungs After smoking marijuana, the bronchial passage relaxes and becomes enlarged, and the blood vessels in the eyes expand making the eyes look red. Studies have shown that marijuana smoke contains 50-70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke, and is an irritant to the lungs. Marijuana users tend to inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer than tobacco smokers do, which further increase the lungs' exposure to carcinogenic smoke. Marijuana smokers can have many of the same respiratory problems as tobacco smokers, such as daily cough and phlegm production, more frequent acute chest illness, and a heightened risk of lung infections.1 A case-controlled study from 2006 found no links between marijuana use and lung cancer , but no evidence-based consensus has been definitively made on the absolute risk of lung cancer with marijuana use. Effects of Heavy Marijuana Use on Social Behavior Heavy marijuana abuse may show low achievement in important life measures including mental and physical health, and career. Marijuana affects memory, judgment and perception. Learning and attention skills are impaired among people who use it heavily. Longitudinal research on marijuana use among young people below college age indicates those who use marijuana have lower achievement than the non-users, more acceptance of deviant behavior, more delinquent behavior and aggression, greater rebelliousness, poorer relationships with parents, and more associations with delinquent and drug-using friends. Smoking marijuana can make driving dangerous. The cerebellum is the section of our brain thatALASKA MARIJUANA HANDLER CERTIFICATION COURSE 101-AK | 4 controls balance and coordination. When THC affects the cerebellum's function it can cause disaster on the road. Research shows that drivers have slower reaction times, impaired judgment, and problems responding to signals and sounds if driving while under the influence of THC.2 Addictive Potential A drug is addicting if it causes compulsive, uncontrollable drug craving, seeking, and use, even in the face of negative health and social consequences. Research suggests that roughly 9 percent of users become addicted to marijuana, with higher rates if the user starts at a young age (17 percent) and in those who use marijuana daily (25-50 percent). While not everyone who uses marijuana becomes addicted, when a user begins to seek out and take the drug compulsively, that person is said to be dependent or addicted to the drug. Long-term users who try to quit could experience withdrawal symptoms such as sleeplessness, irritability, anxiety, decreased appetite and drug craving. Withdrawal symptoms usually begin about a day after the person stops using marijuana, peaks in 2 to 3 days and may take about 1 to 2 weeks to subside. Some heavy users develop a tolerance to marijuana; meaning that the user needs larger doses to get the same desired results that he or she used to get from smaller amounts. Immediate Signs of Weed Use - www.narconon.org The most immediate signs of smoking weed are dilation of the blood vessels in the eyes (making them bloodshot ), increased heart rate , increased appetite and memory impairment , along with difficulty paying attention or solving problems . But the real reason people abuse the drug is for the euphoria that may last three to six hours . When monitoring for symptoms of weed use, there may be reactions of anxiety , fear or panic , especially if they are new to the drug or taking it in an unsettling location. Hallucinations , paranoia and delusional behavior can be symptoms of weed use that is very potent, or consumption of a large amount .ALASKA MARIJUANA HANDLER CERTIFICATION COURSE 101-AK | 5 Red, bloodshot eyes Laughter and glee when it is not warranted Euphoria Strongly increased appetite for snack foods or sweets Foggy, slow memory Artificially increased tendency to chatter or be sociable Lowered inhibitions Impaired judgment Dizziness Sedation, slow movement Lethargy, lack of activity MARIJUANA HANDLERS - Key Points Side effects of marijuana use will be variable from person to person , depending upon strength and amount of marijuana used and if the user is occasionally or chronically exposed to THC.

Marijuana is addictive. 2. It is against the law for people under 21 to use marijuana. 3. Marijuana use gets in the way of saying YES to other exciting opportunities in life. The Good News! Most high school seniors (73%) in Washington state DON'T use marijuana. However, after alcohol, marijuana is the drug most commonly used by high school students who use drugs. About 20% of students in 10th grade have used marijuana in the past 30 days. Those that do are more likely to get lower grades in school. (2012 Washington State Healthy Youth Survey) Marijuana is the most common drug used by children 12-17 years old who visit hospital emergency rooms for drug misuse or abuse. While there are no records of death directly from marijuana overdose, serious health problems occur when potent marijuana products are eaten or inhaled. Parent Guide Marijuana is addictive. Most teens who enter substance abuse treatment programs in Washington state report that marijuana is the main or only drug they use. Teens who identify other drugs as their primary drug of choice often say they use marijuana too. Adolescents who start using marijuana before the age of 14 are four times more likely to become addicted by the time they are adults. Marijuana addiction is more common among teens than adults because their brains are stillALASKA MARIJUANA HANDLER CERTIFICATION COURSE 101-AK | 4 developing and vulnerable. Some teens make the mistake of believing that marijuana can help reduce issues with ADHD or anxiety, and improve their focus in school. But, in truth, adolescents who use marijuana can have: Increased difficulty memorizing things Distorted thinking and perception (exaggerated or irrational thoughts) Hallucinations Paranoia Depression Anxiety Depression A permanent decrease in IQ with prolonged use Hallucinations Teens who use marijuana are actually more likely to experience school failure, which can lead to school drop out. Adolescents addicted to marijuana often struggle with new mental health problems such as anxiety, depression and paranoia. Marijuana addiction can also make existing mental health conditions worse. When addicted to marijuana, adolescents often lack motivation and energy, and lose interest in activities they used to enjoy. What can YOU do? Even as teens, children care about what parents say. One of the key reasons teens choose not to use drugs is because they know their parents don't approve of it. Express a no use attitude. Children whose parents have a positive attitude toward marijuana use are five times more likely to use marijuana by 8th grade. Start early!ALASKA MARIJUANA HANDLER CERTIFICATION COURSE 101-AK | 5 Since teenagers who use marijuana often start by age 14, parents should start an ongoing conversation about drugs by 4th or 5th grade. Be clear and specific about your family expectations about marijuana use. What to say to 4th & 5th graders: \"What do you know about marijuana? Do you know that marijuana can hurt your health? Marijuana use is against the law for anyone under 21 years old. We want you to do well in school, so we have a family rule against using drugs, including marijuana.\" Give your child ways to say no to marijuana and other drugs. Role play social situations where your child is offered marijuana by a peer. Help your child to find the right words to refuse drug offers. Help your child suggest an alternative to using drugs. Let your child know that it is fine to walk away from someone, including a friend, who is offering drugs and, if needed, to call you for a ride home. What to say to young teens: \"Remember our family rule against using marijuana? Let's talk about how you can refuse drugs, including marijuana, if offered to you.\" Set clear guidelines. Communicate the importance of healthy behaviors and establish clear and specific rules about not using marijuana and other drugs. This can be part of a broader conversation about expectations for things like: Doing chores Following parental rules Showing respect for family members Bedtimes Curfews Following laws and school regulations School and class attendance Provide consistent negative consequences for not meeting the guidelines. Remember to provide compliments for good choices and healthy behavior.ALASKA MARIJUANA HANDLER CERTIFICATION COURSE 101-AK | 6 What to say: \"It is important to our family that we all stay healthy and safe. One way to do this is to avoid drug use, including marijuana. This is especially important for teenagers since marijuana can harm the developing brain. That's why we have a family rule against using marijuana. If we find out you are using drugs, what do you think a fair consequence would be?\" Keep track of your child. Monitor your child's behavior to ensure the rules are being followed. Remain actively involved in your child's life and get to know his or her friends. Network with other parents so that you may support one another to keep your children away from drugs. Keep lines of communication open. Eat dinner together. Do fun family activities together. Communicate the way your child does (texting, email, Facebook, Twitter). Monitor your own behavior. You are a role model for your child so think about what you do and the message it sends. Avoid heavy drinking around your child or teen. Do not use marijuana around your child or teen. What do I do if I find my teen is using marijuana or other drugs or breaking other family rules? Keep calm. Communication is key! When dealing with behavior problems it is important to communicate your disapproval of the behavior without making your child feel rejected or like they are a bad person. Remember the guidelines that were set and the consequences that go along with breaking them. Leave the door open for problem solving. What do I avoid? Don't overreact. This may lead your child to take greater risks to prove that they are independent. When consequences feel overly punishing, your teen is more likely to: Rebel Feel resentment Take revenge and you may see the behavior get worse. This is not the time for anger, accusations, name calling or sarcasm.ALASKA MARIJUANA HANDLER CERTIFICATION COURSE 101-AK | 7 How can I tell if my teen is using marijuana? Be aware of changes in your child's behavior, such as carelessness with grooming, mood changes, and relationship problems with family members and friends. In addition, changes in grades, skipping school, lost interest in favorite activities, and changes in eating or sleeping habits could all be related to drug use. If someone is high on marijuana, they might: Seem dizzy or uncoordinated Seem silly and giggly for no reason Have very red, bloodshot eyes Have a hard time remembering things that just happened If someone uses marijuana often, they might: Have an odor on clothes and in the bedroom Use incense and other deodorizers in living space Increase their use of perfume, cologne or breath mints Use eye drops Wear clothing or jewelry or have posters that promote drug use Have unexplained use of money or may steal money Have items used with drugs such as pipes, bongs, scales, rolling papers, blunt wraps or vapor pens Frequently Asked Questions Isn't marijuana safer for teens than alcohol and tobacco? Marijuana, alcohol and tobacco are all potentially harmful drugs. Each affects teens differently. Teen marijuana use is associated with many health and safety problems listed earlier in this pamphlet. Isn't marijuana natural and therefore OK for teens to use? There are many natural things that are not good for our bodies. Regardless of it being \"natural\" or not marijuana can harm youth health. Isn't it better for my child to consume marijuana at home where I can make sure they stay safe?ALASKA MARIJUANA HANDLER CERTIFICATION COURSE 101-AK | 8 Research shows that teens who use alcohol at home are actually more likely to abuse alcohol when not at home. The same holds true for marijuana. What about marijuana brownies and cookies? Aren't they safer than smoking marijuana? Marijuana, no matter how it is used, is harmful to teen health. Some marijuana products that are eaten or vaporized are more potent than smoked marijuana. The health effects of teen marijuana use listed earlier in this pamphlet are the same whether marijuana is smoked, vaporized, or swallowed. I smoked when I was a kid, why deny a rite of passage? Keep in mind that most teens do not use marijuana, so it is not really a rite of passage. Today's marijuana is more potent than the marijuana that was available in the past. In addition, some marijuana products being sold are \"concentrates\" and are even more potent. How do I tell my child not to smoke if I do now or did when I was younger? Just like with alcohol, tell your child that it is against the law to use marijuana until they are 21. The teen brain can be harmed by regular marijuana use in ways that the adult brain is not. Using marijuana as a teen increases the likelihood that a person will become addicted to marijuana. MARIJUANA HANDLERS - Key Points A person under the age of 21 may not enter a retail marijuana store. A licensed retail marijuana store shall refuse to sell marijuana or a marijuana product to any person who does not produce a form of valid photo identification showing that person is 21 years of age or older .
