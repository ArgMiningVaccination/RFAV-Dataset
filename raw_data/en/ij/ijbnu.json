Methods: We review recent literature examining the links between the history of colonialism and government interventions (including the residen-tial school system, out-adoption, and centralised bureaucratic control) andthe mental health of Canadian Aboriginal peoples. Results: There are high rates of social problems, demoralisation, depres- sion, substance abuse, suicide and other mental health problems in many,though not all, Aboriginal communities. Although direct causal links aredifficult to demonstrate with quantitative methods, there is clear and com-pelling evidence that the long history of cultural oppression and marginali-sation has contributed to the high levels of mental health problems found inmany communities. There is evidence that strengthening ethnocultural iden-tity, community integration and political empowerment can contribute toimproving mental health in this population. Conclusions: The social origins of mental health problems in Aboriginal communities demand social and political solutions. Research on variations inthe prevalence of mental health disorders across communities may provideimportant information about community-level variables to supplement litera-ture that focuses primarily on individual-level factors. Mental health promo-tion that emphasises youth and community empowerment is likely to havebroad effects on mental health and wellbeing in Aboriginal communities. Key words: culture, First Nations, health promotion, Inuit, Metis, residential schools, trauma, youth. lthough Aboriginal peoples in Canada, Australia and New Zealandcomprise extremely diverse cultures, they have faced similarsociohistorical predicaments. The comparative study of social policy and Aboriginal mental health across countries can shed light onproblems and solutions. 1 In this article, we outline the social origins and political context of mental health problems in Canadian Aboriginalcommunities, describe some recent approaches to collective healing anddiscuss their implications for mental health promotion. Notions of tradition and healing are central to contemporary efforts by Aboriginal peoples to confront the legacy of historical injustices andsuffering brought on by the history of colonialism. 2 Through individual and community-based initiatives as well as larger political and culturalprocesses, Aboriginal peoples in Canada are involved in healing theirown traditions, repairing the ruptures and discontinuity in the trans-mission of traditional knowledge and values, and asserting their collec-tive identity and power.

Email: laurence.kirmayer@mcgill.ca A at MINNESOTA STATE UNIV MOORHEAD on January 14, 2014 apy.sagepub.com Downloaded from Australasian Psychiatry Vol 11 Supplement 2003 S16 The metaphor of healing traditions has several poten- tial meanings. First, it refers to recovering andapplying traditional methods of healing. Aboriginalpeoples had a wide range of methods of healing thatwere embedded in religious, spiritual and subsistenceactivities and that served to integrate the communityand provide individuals with systems of meaningto make sense of suffering. These traditions weredisplaced and actively suppressed by successive gen-erations of Euro-Canadian missionaries, governmentsand professionals. Recuperating these traditionstherefore reconnects contemporary Aboriginalpeoples to their historical traditions and mobilisesrituals and practices that may promote communitysolidarity. More broadly, the recovery of tradition itself may be viewed as healing, both at individual and collectivelevels. Hence, efforts to restore language, religiousand communal practices have been understood bycontemporary Aboriginal peoples as fundamentallyacts of healing. For most Aboriginal peoples, tradi-tional subsistence activities (e.g. hunting) have beendeeply integrated with religious and spiritual beliefsas well as with networks of family and communityrelationships. Returning to the land to take part inthese activities may then have healing value both fortroubled individuals and whole communities. Finally,establishing legal claims to traditional lands andself-government may also be viewed as crucial ele-ments of re-asserting cultural tradition, even whenthe forms of governance reflect contemporary politi-cal realities. Any approach to mental health promotion with Aboriginal peoples must consider these ongoing usesof tradition to assert cultural identity. At the sametime, it is crucial to recognise that biomedicine andpsychiatry are also traditions that convey not onlytechnical scientific knowledge but also whole systemsof cultural values and practices. Recognising our ownpractice as a 'tradition' means that we understand theprocess of culture change as a two-way street andencourages us to de-centre, and rethink the exchangeof values on a more level playing field. It provides abasis from which to seriously encounter and engageothers' traditions and work toward an effective plural-ism and hybridisation of models and methods inmental health care. ABORIGINAL PEOPLES OF CANADA Almost 1 million people self-identify as Aboriginal inCanada, representing 3.3% of the total population. 3 While many live on reserves, 41% reside in non-reserve areas (36% urban, 5% rural). AboriginalPeoples include Amerindian peoples referred to asFirst Nations as well as Inuit and M\u00e9tis who accountfor about 5% and more than 20% of Aboriginalpeople, respectively. The population is demographi-cally distinctive in being younger than the generalCanadian population (mean age 25.5 vs. 35.4 forgeneral population) with fully one-third of the Abo-riginal population younger than 15 years of age.There is great diversity within this population with11 major language groups and more than 58 dialects,596 First Nations bands and 2284 reserves. Aboriginal peoples suffer from a wide range of health problems at much higher rates than other Canadi-ans. 4,5 They have 6-7 times greater incidence of tuber- culosis, are 4-5 times more likely to be diabetic,3 times more likely to have heart disease and hyper-tension and twice as likely to report a long-termdisability. Injuries and poisonings are the main causeof potential years of life lost; Aboriginal peoples have1.5 times national mortality rate and 6.5 timesnational rate of death by injuries and poisonings. Social problems are also endemic. The incarceration rates of Aboriginal people are 5-6 times higher thanthe national average. In a recent survey, 39% ofAboriginal adults reported that family violence is aproblem in their community, 25% reported sexualabuse and 15% reported rape. 6 About 4% of First Nations children were in custody of Child and FamilyService agencies in 1996/97. These health and social problems are reflected in the high rates of mental health problems. 7-9 Age standard- ised suicide rates of Aboriginal youth are 3-6 timesthe general population. 10 The actual rates of psychi- atric disorders are not known but are presumed to behigh in many communities. Although these problems affect individuals, their high prevalence underscores the need for populationlevel approaches. From the perspectives of populationhealth and mental health promotion, several keyquestions arise from these statistics. What are theorigins of the social problems confronting indigenouspeoples? How can we connect the personal and thecollective aspects of pathology and healing? What arethe needs of each of the present generations (chil-dren, youth, adults, elders)? What will be the needsof the next generations? THE IMPACT OF EUROPEAN COLONIALISM The origins of the high rates of mental health and social problems in Aboriginal communities are nothard to discern. Aboriginal peoples in Canada havefaced cultural oppression through policies of forcedassimilation on the part of Euro-Canadian institu-tions since the earliest periods of contact. Earlymissionary activities focused on saving heathen soulsby religious conversion. In many cases, this involvedsuppression or subversion of existing religious beliefsand practices that were integral to subsistence activi-ties and the structure of families and communities.Early trade and military alliances were generally at MINNESOTA STATE UNIV MOORHEAD on January 14, 2014 apy.sagepub.com Downloaded from Australasian Psychiatry Vol 11 Supplement 2003 S17 arranged without regard for Aboriginal cultural values or relationships. The Canadian government informally recognised the indigenous communities of Canada as peoples ornations but they were viewed as uncivilised andhence unable to acquire rights as citizens in a demo-cratic polity. The Bagot Commission Report (1844) argued that reserves in Canada were operating in a'half-civilised state' and that, in order to progresstowards civilisation, Aboriginal peoples needed to beimbued with the principles of industry and know-ledge through formal education. The Bagot Commis- sion Report resulted in a shift in Indian policy in Canada away from the guiding principle of protec-tion towards assimilation; this was reinforced by the Davin Report (1879), which recommended a policy of 'aggressive civilisation'. Aboriginal adults and elderswere perceived by Davin to possess 'the helpless mindof a child.' Hence, to be integrated into the emergingnation, Aboriginal children had to be separated fromtheir parents and 'civilised' through a program ofeducation that would make them talk, think and actlike British Canadians. Following the recommendation of the Davin Report , residential education for Aboriginal children in Canada was modelled after the system of boardingschools in the United States. 11,12 Residential schools for Aboriginal children functioned as 'total institu-tions' 13 or a 'carceral space': 14 the schools were located in isolated areas; the children were allowed little orno contact with their families and communities;there was a regime of strict discipline and constantsurveillance over every aspect of their lives; andcultural expressions through language, dress, food, orbeliefs were vigorously suppressed. At their height, there were 80 residential schools operating across Canada with a peak enrolment in1953 of over 11 000 students. While some familieswelcomed the opportunity for formal education fortheir children, many would desperately try to avoidthe Indian agent as he collected community children(Johnston, 1988). 15 Intensive surveillance and control of the lives ofAboriginal peoples in Canada went beyond the resi-dential school system. Beginning in the 1960s, largenumbers of Aboriginal children were taken from theirfamilies and communities and placed in foster care.Eventually, many of these children were adopted intonon-Native families in Canada and the United States.Termed the 'Sixties Scoop', this practice lasted almostthree decades, although statistics indicate that thereis still an over-representation of Aboriginal childrenin the care of non-Aboriginal institutions and fosterfamilies. The apprehension of Aboriginal children bythe Child Welfare System was based on premisessimilar to that of the residential school system. It washeld that Aboriginal parents could not provide appro-priate homes or upbringing for their children andthat the disorganised nature of reserve communitiesnecessitated state intervention. 16,17 By the 1970s, approximately one in four status Indi-ans could expect to be separated from his or herparents; rough estimates on the rates of non-statusand M\u00e9tis children apprehended from their familiesshow that one in three could expect to spend theirchildhood as a legal ward of the state. 16 The large- scale apprehension of Aboriginal children from thefamily, community and cultural context via theresidential school system and the 'Sixties Scoop' hashad damaging consequences for individuals and com-munities. Much like former residential school stu-dents, who often returned to their communities in aculturally 'betwixt and between' state, Aboriginalchildren relegated to the care of the state or non-Aboriginal families have experienced problems ofidentity and self-esteem growing up on the marginsof two worlds. Physical and sexual abuse, emotionalneglect, internalised racism, language loss, substanceabuse and suicide are common in their stories. 16,17 The intense governmental surveillance and control ofthe lives of Aboriginal peoples in Canada was mandatedand institutionalised by federal Indian policy. The Indian Act (1876) is the most comprehensive piece of federal legislation directed towards the management ofAboriginal peoples in Canada. Although establishedover a century ago, this document continues to play anintegral role in the lives and juridical identities ofAboriginal peoples. The Indian Act defines Aboriginal peoples as Crown wards, subjects for whom the statehas a responsibility to provide care. 18 The broad applica- tion of the Act has ranged from prohibiting participa-tion in cultural activities such as the potlatch and thesun dance, restricting movement through the applica-tion of the pass system, to creating social categories ofidentity such as 'status' and 'non-status Indians' andexempting status Indians from taxation. 19,20 The Indian Act has been the focus of great conflict and contestation in many communities that have beenforced to reconcile local notions of membership,citizenship, political participation and structure withimposed legal sanctions and controls. For example,the patrilineal descent recognised by the Indian Act resulted in the removal from their communities ofmany Aboriginal women (and their children) whomarried non-Aboriginal men in the 20th century.Acknowledging the colonial and archaic nature of the Indian Act and its negative consequences in Aborigi- nal communities across Canada, the federal govern-ment is currently attempting to replace the Indian Act with a more modern document, the First Nations Governance Act (FNGA). However, there is concern that this legislation will modernise but not eliminatethe systems that disempower Aboriginal peoples andcommunities. at MINNESOTA STATE UNIV MOORHEAD on January 14, 2014 apy.sagepub.com Downloaded from Australasian Psychiatry Vol 11 Supplement 2003 S18 MENTAL HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF CULTURAL SUPPRESSION AND FORCED ASSIMILATION While epidemiological research identifies the mag- nitude and distribution of mental health and socialproblems of Aboriginal peoples in Canada, qualitativestudies implicate the collective exposures of Aborigi-nal peoples to forced assimilation policies as primecauses of poor health and social outcomes. Thepolicies of forced assimilation have had profoundeffects on Aboriginal peoples at every level of experi-ence from individual identity and mental health, tothe structure and integrity of families, communities,bands and nations. Narratives and life histories suggest that the residen- tial school experience has had enduring psycho-logical, social and economic effects on survivors. 12,17,21, Transgenerational effects of the residential schoolsinclude: the structural effects of disrupting familiesand communities; the transmission of explicit modelsand ideologies of parenting based on experiences inpunitive institutional settings; patterns of emotionalresponding that reflect the lack of warmth andintimacy in childhood; repetition of physical andsexual abuse; loss of knowledge, language and tradi-tion; systematic devaluing of Aboriginal identity;and, paradoxically, essentialising Aboriginal identityby treating it as something intrinsic to the person,static and incapable of change. These accounts pointto a loss of individual and collective self-esteem, toindividual and collective disempowerment and, insome instances, to the destruction of communities. The legacy of the policies of forced assimilation is also seen in the current relationship of Aboriginalpeoples with the larger Canadian society. Images ofthe 'savage' and stereotypes of the 'drunken Indian'continue to recur in popular media. Racism is stillwidespread, if often subtle, and beyond active dis-crimination there is a continuing lack of historicalawareness of the experience of Aboriginal peopleswith colonisation and the enduring impact on theirwellbeing and social options. Governmental, bureau-cratic and professional tutelage and control continueto undermine Aboriginal efforts at self-direction. The impact of local control on mental health has been strikingly illustrated in a study that comparedthe rates of completed suicide in 80 bands in BritishColumbia. 22 There was wide variation in rates, with some communities exhibiting no suicides whileothers suffered very high rates. Each community wasscored on seven measures of what was termed 'cul-tural continuity': self-government, involvement inland claims, band control of education, health serv-ices, cultural facilities, police and fire services. Therate of suicide was strongly correlated with the levelof these factors. Communities with all seven factorshad no suicides while those with none of the factorshad extremely high suicide rates. Of course, it ispossible that some of these factors are markers forhealthy communities and that the link to suicide isthrough other covarying but unmeasured factorsincluding: collective self-efficacy and self-esteem;better infrastructure or community organisation; andmore job opportunities or active roles for youth.Labelling these factors as 'cultural continuity' is alsoquestionable; the involvement of Aboriginal peoplein contemporary institutions such as municipalgovernment or formal school systems can hardly beviewed as cultural traditionalism. 'Local control'seems a more accurate term and this probably reflectscultural adaptability and pluralism rather than themaintenance of tradition. Nevertheless, this studyprovides compelling evidence for the impact ofcommunity level factors and should encourage otherstudies of determinants of mental health using care-ful analysis of the history, structure and dynamics ofcommunities. Cultural continuity remains an interesting construct and one that is important in the light of ongoingefforts of Aboriginal peoples to recuperate andreclaim traditional knowledge and values as anexplicit basis for collective identity and communitycohesion. Cultural continuity can be expressed inmany ways, but all depend on a notion of culture assomething that is potentially enduring or continu-ously linked through processes of historical trans-formation with an identifiable past or tradition. Tosome extent, it is precisely this notion that has beenchallenged by recent critical writing on the notion ofculture itself. 23 WHAT IS ABORIGINAL CULTURE OR TRADITION? Despite concerted efforts at forced assimilation, Abor- iginal cultures have persisted. More that one-quarterof Aboriginal people are able to converse in anAboriginal language. 3 The use of Aboriginal languages has been increasing. Many communities are currentlyengaged in cultural immersion programs gearedtoward strengthening Aboriginal languages and iden-tity. Aboriginal languages are official languages in theNorth-west Territories and Nunavut, a vast region ofCanada's north that was recently recognised as a newprovince with an Inuit-led government. Beyond the issues of language, there are distinctive cultural concepts of personhood and communityamong many Aboriginal peoples. Where the Euro-American notion of the person has been characterisedas egocentric or individualistic, many Aboriginalpeoples retain notions of the person as defined by aweb of relationships that includes not only extendedfamily, kin and clan but, for hunters and other peopleliving off the land, animals, elements of the naturalworld, spirits and ancestors. 24 Aboriginal concepts of at MINNESOTA STATE UNIV MOORHEAD on January 14, 2014 apy.sagepub.com Downloaded from Australasian Psychiatry Vol 11 Supplement 2003 S19 the person thus may be relational or communalistic, ecocentric (connected to the land and to animals) 25-27 and cosmocentric (connecting the person to anancestral lineage or the spirit world). 28 Though these forms of personhood have wide prevalence, it isimportant to recognise the great diversity of Aborigi-nal cultures and communities, which is sometimesobscured by images in the popular media, or byAboriginal peoples themselves when they seek tomake common cause in developing political andcultural institutions. While older anthropological writing conceived of cultures as closed, homogeneous and sometimesstatic systems, contemporary ethnographers view cul-tures as local worlds that are constantly in flux. Thereis great variation in knowledge, practice and attitudesamong individuals within a cultural group, withsignificant conflict, resistance and contestation ofdominant values. Local worlds are embedded in largerglobal systems that bring diverse peoples togetherthrough migration, mass media and other forms ofcontact and exchange. As a result, most individualshave access to and participate in multiple cultures.Individuals use this multicultural background to nav-igate, communicate and provide rhetorical suppliesand discourses within which to locate and constructsocially and psychologically viable selves. These social realities of cultural diversity, hybridisa- tion, flux and change exist in some tension withAboriginal claims for a pan-Indian cultural identityrooted in a timeless mythic past. 29 The reality is that, like all cultural identities, Aboriginality is not 'in theblood' but rooted in forms of life that exist at theconfluence of historical currents and contemporaryforces. Aboriginal identity both springs from withinfamily and communities and is imposed by the largercultural surround. Aboriginal peoples are engaged inan ongoing process of re-articulating themselvesin the modern world in ways that honour theirancestors, maintain links with crucial values, andcreatively respond to the exigencies of a world simul-taneously woven together by electronic media andriven apart by conflicts of culture and value. RE-ARTICULATING TRADITION In recent years, a series of important events havebegun to reverse the cultural marginalisation andoppression endured by Canadian Aboriginal peoples.It is shocking for Euro-Canadians, who have beenprofoundly unaware of the social realities of Aborigi-nal peoples, to be reminded that it was only in 1967that Native peoples gained the right to vote. A pivotalevent in public consciousness was the Oka crisis of1990, in which the Mohawk communities adjoiningMontreal confronted local and federal authorities todefend an ancestral burial ground that was to beappropriated to extend a municipal golf course.During this crisis, Canadians witnessed overt acts ofracism and violence against Aboriginal people andhad to confront a complacent self-image as a nationof tolerance. This led directly to the 1991 Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (RCAP). The public hearings held by the RCAP uncovered the widespreadabuses of the residential school system. In 1993, theRCMP (the federal police force long involved withlaw enforcement in remote regions, including Abor-iginal settlements) established a Native ResidentialSchool Task Force to investigate residential schoolsfrom 1890 to 1984. The RCAP addressed manydimensions of Aboriginal health and included specialreports on suicide 30 as well as volumes on the needs of urban Aboriginal peoples and on healing. 30 The RCAP Final Report included a volume Breaking the silence , which detailed the abuses in the residential school system. 32 In 1998, the government responded to the RCAPreport with Gathering strength: Canada's Aboriginal action plan intended to begin a process of reconcilia- tion and renewal. Several new Aboriginal organisa-tions were created, including the Institute forAboriginal Peoples Health (one of 13 Canadian Insti-tutes for Health Research replacing the MedicalResearch Council) and the National AboriginalHealth Organisation. A crucial component of Gathering strength was the establishment of the Aboriginal Healing Foundation (AHF), a federally funded, Aboriginally run, non-profit organisation created in March 1998 to supportcommunity-based healing initiatives of Aboriginalpeople affected by physical and sexual abuse in resi-dential schools, including intergenerational impacts('the Legacy'). The AHF received $350 million over10 years to fund projects to address the legacy ofthe residential schools. The projects funded haveincluded: community services; research;traditional activities (e.g. living on the land pro-grams); and training or educational programs. 2 Aboriginal people have also sought other avenuesfor reconciliation and reparation. As of February2002, there were over 4500 claims representing9000 claimants for damages related to the residentialschools. Only about 10% have been settled. Legalproceedings often involve re-traumatisation andAboriginal organisations continue to explore alter-native dispute resolution methods including estab-lishing a Truth and Reconciliation Commissionsimilar to the process developed in post-apartheidSouth Africa. Efforts at reconciliation are consonantwith the values in many Aboriginal communities,which emphasise maintaining family and communityties and repairing breaches of trust by a public ritualof confession, expiation, and re-commitment to thecommunity. at MINNESOTA STATE UNIV MOORHEAD on January 14, 2014 apy.sagepub.com Downloaded from Australasian Psychiatry Vol 11 Supplement 2003 S20 Many communities have experimented with various forms of 'sentencing circles' for healing and reinteg-rating offenders who might otherwise be ostracisedand handled entirely within the penal system. 32,33 Other uses of meeting in circles include: talkingcircles, in which people speak openly and listen toothers' stories to begin to become aware of originalhurts; sharing circles in which a high degree of trustis established and people express painful emotions;healing circles where people can work throughmemories of painful experiences; and spiritual circlesin which people develop trust in their own experi-ences of spirituality as a source of comfort andguidance. The rules of these circles vary with theirgoals but have in common an emphasis on theindividual's commitment to change, an etiquette thathonours the individual voice through respectful lis-tening, and a process of reaffirming collective andcommunal solidarity. The last century saw the emergence of various forms of pan-Indian spirituality, in which practices associ-ated with specific cultural groups have been widelyadopted and served both as effective healing ritualsfor groups and as symbols of shared identity andaffiliation. The elements of this common spiritualtradition include a focus on the Creator, the symbol-ism of the medicine wheel, the use of the sweat lodgeand traditional plant medicines, pow-wow costumedances, drumming and tobacco offerings. 35-37 In parallel, increased awareness of the historicalpredicament of Aboriginal peoples has become arallying point. In the US, the attention to traumaamong Vietnam veterans provided a context toreconsider the collective trauma of American Indi-ans. 38-41 For Canadian Aboriginal peoples, the revela- tions of the evils of the residential schools havemade the notion of individual and collective traumasalient. 21 Some Aboriginal people have made use of communal settings to tell the story of their suffering.In these accounts, individual traumas and losses maybe explicitly linked to collective traumas. This servesto make sense of suffering and valorise it as part of alarger collective struggle. At the same time, themetaphors of individual and collective trauma haveboth positive value and limitations. On the plus side,the metaphor of trauma draws attention to theseverity, shock and violence of the physical andpsychological injuries inflicted on Aboriginal peoples.It locates the origins of problems in a shared past andso motivates the reconstruction of historical memoryand collective identity. Ideally, this history wouldinsist on the importance of social and political eventsand so would avoid 'psychologising' what are funda-mentally political issues. 42 However, like any partial truth, the metaphor oftrauma also has limitations and unwanted connota-tions. Current trauma theory and therapy tend tofocus on the psychiatric disorder of posttraumaticstress disorder and may give insufficient attentionto the other dimensions of experience that may beprofoundly transformed by massive trauma and abro-gation of human rights. These include issues of secureattachment and trust, belief in a just world, a sense ofconnectedness to others and a stable personal andcollective identity. 43 The emphasis on the most overt and dramatic forms ofaggression and abuse may make it harder to recognisemore subtle, indirect, and insidious effects of residen-tial schools and other forces of forced assimilation onindividuals and communities. 44 The location of the origins of trauma in past events may divert attentionfrom the realities of a constricted present and murkyfuture, which are the oppressive realities for manyAboriginal young people living in chaotic and de-moralised communities. Finally, an emphasis on pasttrauma as an explanation for current suffering ignoresthe pervasiveness of everyday, routinised practices ofexclusion and marginalisation. YOUTH, IDENTITY AND COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT The cumulative effects of internal colonialism on cultural identity and continuing tensions betweenthe values of Aboriginal peoples and mainstreamsociety complicate the efforts of Aboriginal youth toforge their identities and find their ways in the world. Despite important social and cultural differences across Aboriginal peoples, young people played avital role in traditional community life. 45 The notion of adolescence as a distinct period in the life cyclebetween childhood and adulthood was not sharplydrawn; by their mid-to-late teen years, young peoplewere functioning as adults in the community withresponsibilities for subsistence activities and raisingfamilies. 45,46 The community context for the socialisa- tion of youth has changed dramatically with coloni-alism. 24,47,48 Adolescence and young adulthood have become prolonged periods with ambiguous demarca-tion and social status. Moving from traditional timeswhere 'everyone was important and everyone had arole', 49 colonialism has resulted in impoverished roles and opportunities within many communities, leavingyouth without clearly defined direction. There are important gender differences in the ways that culture change has affected traditional roles. 50 For young women, there has been more continuity insocial roles and many are involved in child-rearing, aswell as work and school. 50,51 They may suffer from role strain as they try to fulfil multiple tasks. Young men,in contrast, have experienced a profound disjuncturebetween traditional roles and the limited opportuni-ties available to them in many Aboriginal communi-ties. The high suicide rates among Aboriginal youngmen can be related to this loss of valued status and at MINNESOTA STATE UNIV MOORHEAD on January 14, 2014 apy.sagepub.com Downloaded from Australasian Psychiatry Vol 11 Supplement 2003 S21 direction. 10 The discontinuity in roles and the emer- gence of adolescence as a prolonged life stage requires adaptations within communities to provide construc-tive and meaningful opportunities for young peopleto develop their potential. While youth had a place in traditional decision- making processes, today they are largely excludedfrom community decision-making and are the passiverecipients of mental health programs and servicesdesigned and delivered through centralised state decision-making processes. 52 The lack of success of many such programs has been attributed to the lack of Aborigi-nal participation, which could make programs cultur-ally meaningful and locally more relevant. 52 In recent years, the Canadian government andthe World Health Organization ushered in a newapproach to health programming with the frame-work Achieving health for all: a framework for health promotion 53 and the Ottawa charter for health promo- tion . 54 Health promotion, defined as 'the process of enabling people to increase control over the deter-minants of their health', is rooted in the values ofrespect, caring, equality and self-determination. 55 Empowerment, a cardinal principle of health promo-tion, involves a shift from a top-down approach tothe design and implementation of categorical healthprograms to community processes aimed at engagingcommunity members in decisions that affect them inthe context of their everyday lives. 56 There is recog- nition by the state that the quality of programmingdecisions can be improved with decentralised proc-esses that actively engage Aboriginal peoples in pro-gram planning and delivery. 57 However, this requires changing the nature of relationships between Abor-iginal communities and the state, to allow for com-munity control and governance over programdevelopment and administration. Within Aboriginalcommunities, empowerment requires shifting thepower relationships that exist between youth andadults from exclusionary and paternalistic modesfostered by the legacy of residential schools andgovernmental control, toward inclusive egalitarianpractices that allow for meaningful collaboration. 58 Mental health promotion programs orientated towardempowerment aim to restore positive youth mentalhealth and a strong sense of cultural identity by givingyouth an active role in designing and implementingprograms that meet their needs. Health promotion,with its emphasis on empowerment, may represent acontemporary re-articulation of traditional egalitarianpractices that recognised the central role of youth inthe health and vitality of the community. CONCLUSION: IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH POLICY AND PROMOTION Through state policies aimed at forced assimilation, Aboriginal peoples in Canada have suffered individ-ual and collective violence, trauma and loss. Under-standing the consequences of this history for mentalhealth and wellbeing requires a model of the trans-generational impact of culture change, oppressionand structural violence. The social origins of prevailing mental health prob- lems require social solutions. Although conventionalpsychiatric practice tends to focus on the isolatedindividual, the treatment of mental health problemsas well as prevention and health promotion amongAboriginal peoples must focus on the family andcommunity as the primary locus of injury and thesource of restoration and renewal. Individual identity and self-esteem, which are central to health and wellbeing, may draw strength anddepth from collective identity. 59 Where the collective is devalued, the individual may suffer correspondingwounds to their esteem and to their social 'capital',power and mobility. Collective identity, however, isnot simply intrinsic or internal to a specific ethno-cultural group or community. It is created out ofinteractions with a larger cultural surround, whichmay impose disvalued identities and marginalisedstatus. The interaction between local and larger cul-tural systems has taken on a new scope and intensitywith the forces of globalisation. The local identity ofyouth is inscribed in a world culture; indeed, throughmass media and Internet exchanges many Aboriginalyouth participate in a global culture in which theyshare more with distant peers than with other gen-erations within their own communities. For most,however, this sort of virtual community cannotreplace local relationships in intimacy, materialsupport or practical resources with which to navigatea future. Mental health promotion with Aboriginal peoples must go beyond the focus on individuals to engageand empower communities. Aboriginal identity itselfcan be a unique resource for mental health promo-tion and intervention. Knowledge of living on theland, community, connectedness, and historical con-sciousness all provide sources of resilience. At thesame time, the knowledge and values held by Aborig-inal peoples can contribute an essential strand to theefforts of other peoples to find their way in a worldthreatened by environmental depredation, exhaus-tion and depletion from the ravages of consumercapitalism. Non-Aboriginal mental health professionals usually approach these problems as outsiders to the commu-nity and face complex problems of position that mayundermine their credibility and effectiveness. Theseinclude the socioeconomic and power disparitiesbetween clinician and patient. No matter how openand unbiased practitioners try to be, they workagainst a backdrop of structural violence, racism andmarginalisation. Only collaborative approaches that at MINNESOTA STATE UNIV MOORHEAD on January 14, 2014 apy.sagepub.com Downloaded from Australasian Psychiatry Vol 11 Supplement 2003 S22 focus on the transfer of knowledge, skills, power and authority can hope to transcend these limitations.The Canadian Institute for Aboriginal Peoples Healthhas funded a number of initiatives to build capacity forhealth research in Aboriginal communities, includinga National Network for Aboriginal Mental Health Research(URL: http://www.mcgill.ca/psychiatry/namh).
