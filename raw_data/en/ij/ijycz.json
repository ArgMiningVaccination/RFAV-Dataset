Dr. Paulos Mar Gregorios sought tobring together in a holistic vision, several unrelateddisciplines like philosophy, economics, political science,medicine, education, physics and theology. Born in 1922 at Tripunithura, Kerala, the great scholar- bishop had his earlier stints in his homestate as a journalistand postal service employee. He proceeded to Ethiopeain 1947 accepting the job of a teacher there and in courseof time became the Special Secretary to Emperor HaillieSellasi. He had an exceptional educational career in Yale,Princeton and Oxford Universities. Returning to Kerala,he was ordained as a priest of the Orthodox Church. In1967 Fr. Paul Verghese became the Principal of theOrthodox Theological Seminary. In 1975, he was elevatedas a bishop. Metropolitan Paulos Mar Gregorios tookcharge of the Delhi Diocese of the Orthodox Church inJuly 1975. Honours came unsought to Mar Gregorios. He had the good fortune to be the President of the World Councilof Churches and the Indian Philosophical Congress. In1988, he received the Soviet Land Nehru Award. His Gracetravelled widely and showed an unusual intellectualcourage to explore new paradigms in human thinking. Hewas visiting professor in several universities like the J. N.U. in New Delhi. The philosopher-bishop passed awayon 24 th November 1996 and his mortal remains lie entombed in the Orthodox Seminary Chapel, Kottayam. Mar Gregorios has authored more than 50 books. The Joy of Freedom , Freedom of Man , The Cosmic Man , The Human Presence , Enlightenment East and West , A Light Too Bright and the spiritual autobiography Love' s Freedom: The Grand Mystery are some of the most remarkable among these. Hundreds of his articles andlectures have been published in leading newspapers, andinternational magazines.FOREWORD My detailed interest in systems of healing is at least thirty years old. I am convinced that the present hegemony of western medicineis not in the best interests of humanity. It seems incapable of meetingthe needs of 6000 million people. At present it hardly reaches a fifthof the world's population. A disproportionately large amount of public funds is now devoted to Western medical education and Western style medical institutions.While the Western system has much to its credit, recent developmentshave made it unaffordable for most people, unacceptable in terms ofthe damage it does, and undesirable in terms of its over-mechanisationand over-technologisation of both diagnosis and therapy. Only aradically reformed Western Medicine can hope to have a significantlylarge place in the future in the world-wide exercise of the healingministry and health care. Wholistic healing is more absent in western systems than in traditional systems. But the latter too are often tempted to imitate thepractices of western medicine, losing thereby its traditional holisticconcern. The present work is a compilation of my occasional writings on this concern through the last thirty years. It is offered as a possiblestimulus to further reflection and a plea for a new type of health carein which the traditional systems and Homoeopathy play a larger rolein caring for the health of humanity. It is also an invitation to a newtype of multi-system healing centres where Allopathy is only one ofthe therapies, along with revived traditional systems, to bring lessharmful and more affordable healing to all people.

The Healing Ministry of the Church7. Reshaping Health CareThe Whole Heals The idea of wholeness can be grasped at various levels, e.g. in concepts like the whole orange, the whole school, the whole ofhumanity, the whole body, the whole created order, and so on. Peopleunderstand the whole as distinct from the part. Understood thus, wholistic healing may mean simply treating the whole body rather than just one malfunctioning organ. For others itmay mean treating the body and the mind together as constituting asingle whole. For yet others wholistic healing may mean taking thesocial relations of the patient into account, so that the human individualis understood in terms of a unit in a social system, relations withinthat system being decisive for health or sickness. To many physicians and surgeons, wholistic healing means something vague, involving the new fads of community medicine andpublic health, health delivery and preventive medicine on the onehand, and on the other adding on to western Allopathic Medicine, alittle of Yoga, Acupuncture, Ayurveda, Tibetan medicine and othertherapies regarded as \"unscientific.\" My purpose is to suggest a more holistic approach, not only to healing, but also to our understanding of the whole as such. 1. What is healing and health? The Christian Medical Commission of the World Council of Churches, more than a decade ago recognized the fact that \"thecauses of ill health have a wide range which include a hostileenvironment, malnutrition, poverty, ignorance, social deprivation andoverly large families.\" l The C.M.C. was set up in 1968, and had been preceded by the first Tuebingen Consultation of 1964 (held at Makerere University inUganda); the World Council of Churches later published the reportof that consultation: The Healing Church , 1965, ed. Frank Davey. The most important single insight of this consultation was that themedical team could not by itself heal; human relations in thecommunity were equally an agent of health and healing: \"we know8 Healing: A Holistic Approach that the healing of bodies apart from life in this fellowship (i.e. the corporate life of the people of God) is as incomplete as launchingships in dry harbours, or sowing seed on stony soil.\" 2 It also hit upon the fact that Latin salus meant both salvation and healing. The decision was made to explore this connection in greaterdetail at the Second Tuebingen Consultation (September 1967), whichin turn led to the constituting of the Christian Medical Commission.The main achievement of this Commission has been the shift of focusfrom the hospital to the community, and therefore the emergence ofthe concept of \"comprehensive health care\" for a community. TheWorld Health Organisation also popularized this concept and it isnow widely accepted but nowhere fully practised; simply becausecomprehensive health care demands a just, and peaceful society andan ecologically healthy environment; and these cannot be achievedovernight. The Commission has also made an attempt to newly conceptualize health and healing, despite 'Bishop David Jenkins' warning, that: \"We cannot therefore separate our attitude to health from our attitude to life. This is why you cannot, and, indeed, must not definehealth. Like life it is an open and as yet undefinable, because as yetunfulfilled, possibility.\" 3 Bishop Jenkins himself, nevertheless, solemnly went on to define health: \"Health is what we enjoy when we are on our way to thatwhich God is preparing for us to enjoy and when we are collaboratingwith Him in that preparation.\" What then is healing and health if health is life itself? What is life? In dealing with that question, we enter into the very depths of themeaning of the whole and of our functioning as human beings withinthat whole. Both physics and biology have made such giant strides inour century, and we need to examine our conceptions of reality in thelight of what these sciences reveal. For the newest insights aboutwholeness have come from these scientific developments, rather thanfrom any abstract philosophical reasoning.9 Healing: A Holistic Approach 2. Reality in Modern Physics The crisis within medical science is only one aspect of the crisis within modern science as a whole, especially in microphysics andmicrobiology and in the philosophy of science. And the crisis of modern science rises from the methodology of that science, which was developed arbitrarily - within a frameworkon Newtonian Mechanics, with causality arbitrarily chosen as thesole principle of explanation, arbitrarily prohibiting teleologicalexplanations (machines have only causal chains, but no purpose oftheir own, supposedly), and banking on repeatable public experience,or the publicly empirical as criterion of validation; true scientificknowledge was wrongly assumed to be unrelated to the mind of theindividual observer, and universal-everlasting without any historicalor social-cultural conditioning. Even in Quantum Theory the attempt has been to explain reality in these mechanical terms. The Copenhagen interpretation modifiesthe classical mechanical conception of causality by introducing theconcept of \"statistical causality.\" Niels Bohr recognized that lightquanta cannot be regarded as particles which would act according tothe laws of Newtonian mechanics, or laws of bodies moving in space;but he too could describe light only in mechanical terms as\"transmission of energy between material bodies at a distance.\" 4 The impossibility of applying classical mechanical explanation to the state of a micro-system at a given moment (and to our knowledgeof that state), was already recognized more than 60 years ago at theInternational Physical Congress (Como, Italy, September 1927). NielsBohr himself advocated the principle of 'complementarity' (overagainst Heisenberg's 'indeterminacy') as a way to explain quantumphenomena in classical mechanical terms. Einstein was not at Comoin September 1927, but in October 1927, at the Fifth Solvay (InstitutInternationale de Physique, Solvay, Brussels) Conference, heexpressed anxiety that the causal-mechanical explanation was beingabandoned by scientists. But Einstein's anxiety has not stemmed the tide of skepticism10 Healing: A Holistic Approach about science's causal explanations and about its privileged access claim to knowledge. Neo-empiricists like Mary Hesse, Ian Hackingand Nancy Cartwright, are abandoning the old 'naive realism' (the\"in science we know reality as it is\" line) and opting for a problem-solving pragmatism which evades the ontological issues. Others wouldprobably call themselves post-empiricists rather than neo-empiricists;among these we count Rorty, Bernstein, Putnam, Habermas and soon. They also do not seek to tackle the metaphysical problem, butwould opt for a loose pragmatism. 6 Nature does not fit classical physics; it does not fit ordinary rationality either. That is the verdict of modern physics. Our classicalnotions of space, time, matter, object, subject, cause, effect and evenof rationality itself have suddenly become obsolete though we continueto work with these timeworn concepts. Fritjof Capra, in his The Turning Point 7 suggests that the new world view of modern physics has moved away from mechanical tosomething more organic, holistic, and ecological - the universe \"as one indivisible, dynamic whole whose parts are essentially inter-related and can be understood only as patterns of a cosmic process.\" 8 There are no 'things' out there - only 'probability waves.' That is not so easy for us to grasp conceptually. There are no things - onlyrelationships. Things do not exist; they happen. And every little eventis influenced by and influences, the whole universe. Causality doesnot require contiguity. Non-local causality connects the whole universe- the whole time-space continuum. That is madening there is \"no out there\", \"no things\", and no mechanical causality. The opposite is what we havebeen dogmatically taught in the name of science - that there is anobjective world out there, that it is composed of \"things\" arranged inorder in space, and that the whole thing is guided by eternal laws ofmotion, like a machine. Bergson and Whitehead tried to give us an alternative picture - that the universe is not made up of things arranged in science, but iscomposed of a series of events in time, constituting a process. Theywere, as philosophers, more in touch with their contemporary scientific11 Healing: A Holistic Approach developments - especially the Special Theory of Relativity, which makes space simply three co-ordinates or dimensions of reality aswe experience it, but with an additional fourth dimension or co-ordinate called time. Space and time were thus seen to be no longerabsolutes, but merely dimensions of our experience of reality - areality related to the subjectivity of the observer. Relativity theoryalso taught us that mass is only another mode of energy; that matteras such is only a form of energy, something full of power andmovement, not wholly inert or static. Matter and movement are nottwo separate realities, as Newton thought. So far, the Special Theory of Relativity (STR) and Quantum Theory (QT) have not yet been satisfactorily reconciled into a General Theoryof Relativity, which would give us a general equation for the whole.The Copenhagen interpretation, more popular among scientists, triesto reconcile the anomalies with the aid of notions like 'statisticalcausality', 'principle of indeterminacy' and 'complementarity' - inorder to bring at least partial order into a bewildering experience ofreality. The other attempt is the \"Boot-strap\" or \"S-matrix\" hypothesis advanced by Geoffrey Chew in the 1960's. It is fascinating as anattempt to do the opposite of what the scientific enterprise has beenall about. Modern science is founded on the idea that reality is regular,independent of the observer, causally determined and thereforeknowable in terms of those regularities and of the principle of causality.The Copenhagen interpretation tries to conserve the foundations ofmodern science, by drawing limits to indeterminacy and unpredictabilityby the notion of 'statistical causality', with indeterminacy at theindividual level and determinacy-predictability at the statistical level. The S-Matrix theory on the other hand denies all fundamental constants, laws or equations. There is consistency and coherencewithin the whole system, but no part of it can have laws and equationswhich govern it, irrespective of its relation to other parts of the system.This makes the S-matrix hypothesis highly suspect in the view ofardent believers in modern science. Accepting it would mean thedenial of traditionally believed notions like the 'laws of nature' on12 Healing: A Holistic Approach which the enterprise of modern science is squarely based. But the S-Martix hypothesis does justice to the observed fact that the observeris inescapably part of what is observed, since every observationsystem includes the observer as an integral part of it. No matter whether you are Copenhagenist or Boot-strapist, Physics, wherein once determinancy and strict causality were thoughtto be self-evident and provable, now reveals that neither determinacynor causality operates at the strict level, and that the laws of Newtonianmechanics are not so universal or \"written into nature.\" This has indeed very big implications for the so-called scientific medicine, and its claims to objectivity in diagnosis and therapy. Beforewe draw out these implications we should take a quick look at thecurrent situation in Biology. 3. The Picture in Modern Biology There was a time when biology and even the social sciences used to emulate the mechanical-causal explanations of physics. The theoryof evolution was such an effort to explain life in terms of mechanicalcausality. Darwin's effort in 1859 was to explain the process ofbiological evolution as a causal chain in which effect follows causewithout a break. \"Natural selection\" based on \"the struggle forsurvival\" and on \"the survival of the fittest\" became the principle ofcausal explanation for the origin of the species. Today biologists are generally reluctant to accept 'natural selection' as an adequate explanatory principle for the theory of evolution assuch. For one thing we have more information on the genetic factorand the possibilities of genetic mutation, than Darwin and hisgeneration had. The distinction between Creationism and Evolutionismlies in a basic belief that species are or are not mutable. For Darwin,species mutability was, an article of faith, not empirically demonstrable,and he had to argue rather than demonstrate his point in The Origin of Species . For whatever natural selection may be able to achieve in terms of survival of the fittest, if there is no possibility of mutation,the amoebum must remain an amoebum, a very fit amoebum, butnothing more than an amoebum. The possibility of mutation should13 Healing: A Holistic Approach be the key to the evolution of species, if it has happened, not just natural selection. In fact biologists have begun to argue that 'naturalselection' is not a necessary condition at all for speciation. A newspecies emerging by genetic-chromosomal mutation is easier tounderstand than the idea of natural selection leading to the emergenceof a new species. 9 After a species has been formed, natural selection may play its role in the survival of fitter specimens within that species.Darwin did not explain what his title stated. Population genetics and molecular genetics bring us closer to understanding the evolution of a new species; but we still look for acausal explanation for the individual events of genetic revolution whichlead to the emergence of one species from another. Most biologistswould regard a combination of selection, heredity and variation as asufficient causal explanation for genetic revolution. 10 But the variation aspect needs further clarification of how genotype variation by naturalselection and inheritance of acquired characteristics can lead to theemergence of a stable new phenotype or the emergence of onespecies from another. Many biologists simply assume that trans-specific change is only the cumulative effect of many generations of intra-specific mutationwhich we can observe. Only since 1980 there has been a widerecognition of a new perspective - that of \"punctuated equillibrium.\"This view, of which Stevan J. Gould is the best known proponent,argues that evolution was marked by long periods of stasis interspersedor punctuated by sudden bursts of mutation leading to speciation.\" 11 Paul Thompson offers us the plausible hypothesis that the Theory of Evolution is not a single consistent theory, but a model whichincorporates several theories, or rather \"a family of inter-actingmodels.\" 12 The fact of the matter, however, is that the theory as it stands at present seems inadequate to explain a number of factors: (a) evolution from simpler towards more and more complex structures; (b) evolution of a new species out of an existing one.14 Healing: A Holistic Approach (c) the deviation of fossil data from the theoretical picture. (d) Why evolution stops with humanity and does not create other, superior, species. In any case the theory of evolution, as we now have it, does not adequately account for the origin of life from non-life, for the specialpattern that it has followed, for the emergence of a brain structureand consciousness such as the human, which human ingenuity cannotreproduce. 4. What Heals? It is a dangerous assumption that we actually understand life in science, that keeps us from using other faculties given to us tounderstand life sufficiently to be able to deal with it creatively. Thescientific understanding of life can help us to complete the picture,but its basic contour escapes the parameters of modern science asthey now stand. It is out of a Christian tradition and general observationthat I make the following affirmations about life. No claim is made interms of scientific validity. 1. There is no such thing as 'nature'; there is only one continuum which includes inorganic matter, life, and consciousness. What isevidently present at the higher levels is already present in an incipientmanner or as potential at the lower levels. 2. Life exists in our world only in relation to and dependent upon the two poles of inorganic matter and consciousness i.e. to the wholeof existence and never without these; it is an open system which hasto draw energy from the inorganic as well as from consciousness. 3. If health is the name for life when it is flourishing, then the healing force is the same as the life-force, and comes from the whole- not from surgical or chemical intervention. 4. The paradigm case for healing is not to be sought in our hospitals and clinics; it is seen in those instances where faith, prayer, touchand word from a caring community have been the major factors inthe healing process. Clinical healing is also using the same four factors,though credit may be given only to drugs or surgical intervention.15 Healing: A Holistic Approach It is perhaps not wholly correct to say that life is the same as healing. Perhaps we should say that the force that promotes life isthe same force which effects healing. In other words life-force andhealing power are akin to each other and have the same source. 5. The Four Levels of Reality as We Perceive it This source is the same source from which the dynamic continuum of reality has its origin and contingent existence. In this continuumwe can observe many levels - from our perspective, four levels withfour different orders or behaving principles. At the lowest level (againfrom our perspective) we have what we call inorganic matter-energy - i.e. bundles and packets and waves of high potency energy showingitself off in a myriad forms - the rocks, the oceans, the hundred ormore elements and their compounds - forces which we see as lightand sound, heat and electricity, magneticism and gravity, and the strongand weak forces that hold matter together or make forms of matter-energy interact with each other, including nuclear power. We call this level inorganic. We once thought that the mechanistic Newtonian paradigm fits this level admirably. We are wiser today. We know thatwhat we call inorganic matter behaves in ways past finding out,especially at the sub-atomic level - not as mass in motion as Newtonthought. Continuous with this inorganic level is the organic level or bio- level. We say continuous because the line of demarcation between acrystal or radioactive element on the one hand and a protein moleculeor virus on the other is not so absolute or clear. In general terms,however, we know how to distinguish between organic and inorganic.We would posit the distinguishing feature of life as homoeostasis orthe capacity to maintain certain internal constants in the face of awide range of external pressures, e.g. a constant temperature of thebody despite a given range of fluctuations in the environmentaltemperature. The whole group of biological sciences deals with thesephenomena we call life. We should not be too sanguine about the completeness of our present knowledge of this level. We have seen what difference alittle discovery about genes and their structure can make in our over-16 Healing: A Holistic Approach all perspective. Nor can we quite state the difference between a living being and a corpse. New discoveries are always in order inbiology and physics; and we should be quite modest about how muchwe know. The third level is where our knowledge is most inadequate - the level of consciousness. Again, there is no clean break between lifeand consciousness. In fact it seems possible to propose thatconsciousness exists at the inorganic level also. Otherwise it wouldbe difficult to explain the behaviour of subatomic particles separatedfrom each other and yet behaving in relation to what happens to theother. In any case, let us say that life has a special kind of consciousness. By consciousness we mean an internal apprehension of externalreality and the capacity to make choices in relation to thatapprehension. Sickness, we now know, is malfunctioning at all threelevels - the chemical or inorganic factors, the biological or organicfactors, and the mental or consciousness factors. Medical and surgical therapy usually pays attention to the first and second levels. Today we are moving towards a higher aetiological role for the third level indiagnosis and a larger hiatric role for consciousness factors includingpsychological process and sociological or communitarian relations. Consciousness is always so difficult to conceptualize or study 'objectively', since its very nature is subjective. The moment weobjectify it, we need a subject other than the object to understand it -another consciousness than the one we are studying. We distortconsciousness, which is always subject, when we make it an object.We do understand more about brain and neural processes than wedid two decades ago. As in the case of genetics, some dramaticprogress has been achieved in neurology also, for example in thefunction of cell membranes. In both genetics and neurology, however,there are huge gaps in our knowledge of the relation between physico-chemical events and psychic events. There is a fourth level about which we know even less. We could call it the cosmic level or the transcendent level. This is the one leastunderstood or even conceded by modern science - how the17 Healing: A Holistic Approach configuration of the whole affects each part and each event. Attempts have been made to conceptualise this through pseudo-sciences likeastrology. Carl Gustav Jung tried to speak about synchronicity as ascientific principle which shows how the micro reflects the macro atany given moment; the Chinese tradition of I-Ching gave him thelead. Karl Pribram and others have sought to make the Jungian conceptmore precise but have found very little approval from the scientificcommunity as a whole. Poetry and art are perhaps better able to cope with this level than science. Religion too deals with this level, through myths, symbolsand rituals, and sometimes through concepts like karma, punarjanma (rebirth), the last judgment , creation, incarnation and redemption. Looking at the whole, scientists observe certain directions in the developmental process, but modern science is still a prisoner of thedogma of its infancy - the ruling out of all teleology or goal-directedness. Today perceptive scientists speak of \"stochasticprocesses\" - i.e. processes in which randomness at one level goes with non-randomness at another, showing overall directedness. We cannot understand the process of the evolution of the life species, theevolution of humanity, or evolution of the human brain as strictly theconsequences of chance or randomness. 6. Consciousness and Reality have same structure One of the most perceptive thinkers and scientists of our time, Gregory Bateson, puts it thus: \"In sum, I shall assume that evolutionary change and somatic change (including learning and thought) are fundamentally similar,that both are stochastic in nature, although surely the ideas (injuctions,descriptive propositions, and so on) on which each process works,are of totaly different logical typing from the typing of ideas in theother process.\" 13 What Bateson tells us is that consciousness as process and the world or evolution as process are both stochastic - \"two great stochasticsystems that are partly in inter-action and partly isolated from eachother ... The two fit together into an ongoing bio-sphere that could18 Healing: A Holistic Approach not endure if either somatic or genetic change were fundamentally different from what it is. The unity of the combined system is neces sary.\"14 What exactly is the nature of this \"unity of the combined system?\" Bateson argues that the two systems jointly constituting it -evolutionary change and human bodily change (genetic or learning)are both mental processes. The cornerstone of his argument in thebook is his brilliant listing and expounding of the six \"Criteria of MentalProcess.\" 15 They are as follows: 1. A Mind is an aggregate of interacting parts or components. 2. The inter-action between parts of mind is triggered by difference , and difference is a non-substantial phenomenon not located in space and time; difference is related to negentropy and entropy rather than to energy. 3. Mental process requires collateral energy. 4. Mental process requires circular (or more complex) chains of determination . 5. In mental process, the effects of difference are to be regarded as transforms (i.e. coded versions) of events which precededthem . The rules of such transformation must be comparatively stable (i.e. more stable than the content) but are themselves subjectto transformation. 6. The description and classification of these processes of transformation disclose a hierarchy of logical type immanent inthe phenomena.\" 16 Bateson's breath-taking argument is that human thought (consciousness), evolution (world-process), ecology (life-environment), life and learning are possible only in systems whichsatisfy these criteria and are therefore \"mental.\" Greg Bateson is not proclaiming any triumph of idealism over materialism. He is arguing that mental processes are involved both inconsciousness and the world, but consciousness and the world aretwo distinguishable but necessarily interacting systems which form a19 Healing: A Holistic Approach necessary unity. This means also that ideas like 'materialism' and 'idealism' do not make sense, since either of these would pre-supposethe primal or primordial being of either matter or mind. In fact thetwo have never existed in isolation; the one seems to be systemicallyintegral to the other. \"The unity of the combined system\" is still a quasi-mechanical concept. We know what 'system' means - a whole in which theparts function in relation to each other and in relation to the whole.The most \"objective\" systems, the ones we know best, are of ourown creation, like computers and other programmed electronicsystems. Is there not the possibility that we are making the samemistake in positing the \"system\" as the paradigm for reality, as Newtondid in positing the \"machine\" as the model for understanding anddescribing reality? You may answer that a \"system\" is the mostcomplex, centered reality that we have objective knowledge of, andtherefore we cannot but choose it as the best paradigm, since by thevery structure of our minds we can understand only through paradigmsand concepts. This insistence that reality must by nature be conceptually graspable and propositionally statable has been a prevailing feature of the westfor centuries. And western civilisation is still reluctant to acknowledgethe evident fact that reality is not conceptually comprehensible, andthat while concepts have an important role in helping us deal withreality, it can be only a partial role, to be supplemented by poetry andart, literature and music, dance and drama, ritual and liturgy, symbolsand stories, parables and silence, feasts and fasting, myths and images,the look and the sigh, groans and gestures. With all that, however, wedo not comprehend reality as a whole conceptually. May I at this stage point to the case which is narrated by Dr. Larry Dossey in his Space, Time and Medicine? 17 This is the case of a wizened old patient at the Dallas Diagnostic Center, who waswasting away: a panoply of two week's worth of diagnostic testsfailed to reveal any organic or functional defect other than that ofwasting away and fast approaching death. Fifty pound weight loss insix months and no clinical possibility of arresting the process. The20 Healing: A Holistic Approach doctors confessed to the patient their inability to do anything clinically. The patient responded that he was dying because he had been\"hexed.\" The doctor, Jim, turned Shaman, and taking a little piece ofthe patient's hair and burning it in the eerie blue flame of a lightedmethenamine tablet on a metal ashtray in a dark hospital examinationroom, the patient watching, \"de-hexed\" him. The patient recoveredand was well! The account is anecdotal; but it is from an eyewitness and silent accomplice, himself a professional physician of high reputation, whom1 know personally (i.e. Larry Dossey himself). I see no reason todisbelieve his account. The physician, \"Jim\", who performed the ritualof de-hexing, did not believe in magic, nor had done anything of thekind before. Despite his lack of faith in his own magic, it worked. The whole heals in ways we do not understand. We know from experience that faith, community, ritual, and word are essentials inthe healing process. Life, Consciousness and Healing Western Medicine is as old as you want to think it is. You can trace it back to Galen (130-200 A.D.) and even to Hippocrates (ca460-377 B.C.); we have at least inherited writings attributed to them.Asklepius is more difficult to trace as a person, 18 but his institution, the Asklepium is known to history and his cult was introduced atAthens in 420 B.C. The serpent was sacred to Asklepius, and is stillthe symbol of the medical profession. Current western medicine likes to think of itself as rooted in the Greek tradition. We have no idea of what all sources the Greeksborrowed from. The Egyptian, the Akkadian and the Sumeriancivilisations are possible sources. According to Emperor Ashoka's(ca 304-232 B.C.) Rock Edicts II and XIII, he sent fully equippedmedical missions to five city states of Greece, \"for relief of sufferingof all creatures, man and beast\" in the 3rd century B.C. Thus Greeceinherited ancient Indian medicine in some form. Indian and Chinese Systems of medicine are definitely older than the Greek. The Ayurveda system goes back to the Vedic period, and21 Healing: A Holistic Approach we hear about Jivaka, the physician appointed by Emperor Bimbisara to take care of Gautama the Buddha (ca 560-480 B.C.). In China the Nei-Ching, the classical system of medicine, was codified only in the reign of the Han dynasty (226 B.C. to 220 A.D.);systems which existed before, seem to have left no written remains. Western medicine as we know it today does not bear much continuity with any of the ancient systems of healing. Healing wasart, not science, practiced by a skilled wise man, a learned man inmany things - not just in anatomy, pathology, pharmacology and kindredsubjects. Modern Western medicine has evolved from the following major factors, among others: (a) The Cartesian (Descartes, 1596-1650) vision of the body as a machine, largely independent of the mind; (b) William Harvey's description of the blood circulation system - largely mechanical; (c) Louis Pasteur's (1822-1895) discovery of bacteria or microbes as major cause of illness; (d) The development of anaesthesia and disinfection, making surgery more successful; (e) Development of new diagnostic techniques, e.g. the stethoscope, sphygmomanometer, and later much more sophisticated deviceslike X-ray, CAT-scanner, and new electronic devices; (f) development of molecular and cellular biology, endocrinology, and nutrition theory; (g) development of vaccination and other immunization technologies;(h) development of antibiotics;(i) development of hygiene and sanitation; The net result of these developments has been, among other things: (a) concentration on the disease rather than on the patient;22 Healing: A Holistic Approach (b) focus on naming the ailment (diagnosis) and then on chemical or surgical intervention to counteract the ailment. (c) focus on the malfunction of the body as root of disease, without reference to the mind or the social and physical environment,without which the body cannot function. (d) shift from personal physician to clinic or hospital as primary healing agent, and the marginalisation of the role of human relations inhealing; (e) the technologization of healing and the soaring cost of medical care; Several factors have today combined to a widespread questioning of the very premises on which western medicine is based, in additionto the cost factor mentioned: (a) the high incidence of hiatrogenic or hospital-induced illness, up to 20% in the U.S.A. of all hospital cases; 19 (b) the perception that most drugs while treating one set of symptoms, create dangerous side effects in other parts of the body; (c) the fact that antibiotics are deleterious to health, since they kill also beneficial bacteria, and besides lead to new strains of bacteriawith increased immunity to antibiotics; (d) the perception that the present medical care system in many market economy countries helps more the medical practitioners, themanufacturers and traders of pharmaceuticals and the medicalinsurance companies than the patients; (e) The fact that western medicine is based on the mechanistic notions of modern science, notions which have been repudiated by scienceitself. The mechanistic conception of the body, and the pathology- pharmacology based on it are quite outdated, though still fashionable.We are desperately in need of a new paradigm that helps to understandthe body-mind as a single unit, a sub-system of a cosmic networksystem.23 Healing: A Holistic Approach There is such a new paradigm emerging. Its contours are not yet clear. But an indication can be seen in a paper by Dr. Deepak Chopraof the American Association for Ayurvedic Medicine, Stoneham,Massachusetts, U.S.A. He represents the quasiscientific his \"Vedic Science\" or \"MaharishiAyurveda.\" Chopra tries to draw a parallel between quantum relations in the universe and mental phenomena - \"that mental events are thesubjective equivalent of quantum mechanical events.\" He posits thateach cell is intelligent and that human intelligence is not like a telephonesystem with its \"exchange\" in the brain, but more like a \"field\" whichpropagates its influence over a large and even unlimited expanse ofspace and time, and that the body itself is a web of such fields, ratherthan molecules organized in space. And every particle of living matteris in touch with every other, so that life as a whole is an intricatecosmic system of interacting fields. \"The human body\", says Chopra,\"is consciousness first and matter second.\" 20 However that be - and ordinary science has yet to accept the hypotheses of Maharishi science - modern science is coming to asimilar conclusion about reality as a whole. David Bohm, the eminentphysicist, has developed a \"holographic\" view of the universe. Ahologram is a no-lens photographic product in which each part containsa reproduction of the whole. This technology invented by DennisGabor (Nobel Physicist) in the sixties has given us a new model tounderstand reality, David Bohm thinks, of course mutatis mutandis ; except that (a) a hologram is produced by just two coherent lightwaves colliding, while the universe may be the product of severalenergy waves colliding and (b) a hologram is static, while reality isdynamic and has to be understood in the rheo-mode or flowing realitymode. Dr. Chopra is right in proposing a parallelism between mental activity and quantum phenomena. Neurons have between them asynapse of 200 Angstroms; this seems to be experimentally verifiable;quantum phenomena within the atom also operate at jumps of about200A o. If there are 15 to 20 billion neurons in our central cortex, and24 Healing: A Holistic Approach they are firing at the rate of about 20 times a second across a 200 A\u00b0 gap, this may create enough coherent waves in the brain to operatesome kind of a holographic technique of recording and recall. Mainstream biologists have yet to accept this theory of holographicrecord-ing and recall. But the parallels are indeed striking. Quantum theory (it is a shame to call it mechanics, though our basic categories of understanding are causal-mechanical) does notsupport our notions of time, space, and causality. Two 'particles'totally separated from each other in our terms of space, canimmediately influence each other by changing itself. And this withoutany known message or energy being transmitted from one particle tothe other (according to our ordinary conceptions of space, localityand distance), and certainly faster than the speed of light (C or 300,000km per second), and therefore without any time-lapse. This is callednon-local causality. David Bohm puts it this way: \"It follows, then, that the explicate and manifest order of consciousness is not ultimately distinct from that of matter in general. Fundamentally these are essentially different aspects of the one over all order. This explains a basic fact that wehave pointed out earlier - that the explicate order of matter in generalis also in essence the sensuous explicate order that is presented inconsciousness in ordinary experience.\" 21 Reality as a whole is a projection of several waves of energy of all kinds, both known and unknown - we call them gravitational,electromagnetic, weak, strong, sound, light etc. - producing ourperception of reality, which is produced by the same projections inconsciousness and in the external world. How close this perception is to at least three of the traditional Asian religious understandings of reality! Take, the Hindu notion of maya , particularly the post-Sankara philosophical elucidation of this concept. Briefly stated, the presentperception and experience of reality or samsara as a flowing reality, is the joint product of a certain vikshepa or projection of power ( maya ) by Ultimate Reality ( Brahman ) and the veil of nescience or avidya brought to perception by the human mind.25 Healing: A Holistic Approach In the Buddhist tradition, the conceptual formulation is even closer to modern physics' perception of reality. The concept of pratitya- samudpada or 'conditioned co-origination' holds that our perception of reality is the joint product of the conceptually indescribable realityand our own mental sensory equipment. In the Chinese tradition also the Ying-Yang dialectic is in some ways parallel to the above. Even more clear are the concepts of taoor order and te or power which together constitute cosmic reality as well as the human reality. In the Eastern Orthodox Christian tradition, this world of ours is a projection of God's energeia , which is the common ground of all nature including human nature. It is God's will (power), and wisdom,and word that keeps both the universe and humanity going. I haveworked this out in my own study of Gregory of Nyssa. 22 The human system is a sub-system of the whole universe, and is integrally related to it. Disturbances in that integral relation constitutedisease. Restoration of that relation to the whole is healing, and thewhole itself is the healing force - the whole is the energy source fromwhich matter, life and consciousness all originate. Matter, life and consciousness are the healing agents. Western medicine has concentrated too exclusively on matter, and when itdoes focus on life, it is only to destroy through antibiotics what isregarded as harmful life. We need a framework for modern medicinein which we see matter, life and consciousness as a single continuumin reality as a whole and in the body. This means that while pharmacology is not to be abandoned, it is to be recognized as only one element in the healing process. Equallyimportant are life and consciousness as well as the relations of thebody-mind whole to the whole of reality. The role of a loving andcaring community as a healing force needs very special considerationin the wholistic pattern of health and healing centres tomorrow.Consciousness, and its various levels, including the transcendent andthe hypnotic, should also be engineered positively in the interest ofhealing. Faith healing needs specialized attention.26 Healing: A Holistic Approach It is towards such a holistic healing ministry that both medical personnel and the public should now devote most of their interests.This would mean also restructuring society in order to make all socialrelations holistic and health-producing, and the human environment alivable and sustainable one.

Gregorios, Cosmic Man , Paragon, New York, 1988, 274 pps28 Healing: A Holistic Approach What is Wholeness? There is a wholeness that is given, and a wholeness that is to be achieved or experienced. Our ordinary perception seems by naturefragmentary, unwhole. The knower stands over against the known,apart from it, and the knowledge gained is 'objective' a la Popper,something which can be stored in books and libraries. Knower, knownand knowledge thus remain three disparate realities, and the wholecannot be in this situation. But today we have access to two other levels of perception, thanks to modern physics and modern astronomy. If we term our ordinarysense-perception the macro-level, there is below it the sub-atomic ormicro-level, and above it the cosmic or mega-level. The mega levelof astrophysics is partly perceivable through our telescopes and partlythrough our mental processes. The micro-level is less perceptible toour senses. The electron microscope does not lead us to direct visionof the sub-atomic level. At the level of elementary 'particles', our eyes, even with the best magnifying instruments at our disposal, do not directly encounterthe reality. We need elaborate tracing and measuring mechanismseven to get a good guess about the way an electron or a neutronfunctions. But in order to trace or measure a sub-atomic particle, weneed to add a quantum of energy to the particle, even to detect it. Buta single photon particle from the measuring device colliding with themeasured particle already deflects its course and transforms it. Soour knowledge of the subatomic level remains conjectural and notdirectly sensate. Nor do we perceive the universe as a whole with our senses. Telescopes can reveal cosmic phenomena in a region of the universe,and electronic computing can bring together infrared or otherphotographs from various regions on a single screen. But there is noway for our telescopes to gather data from all the galaxies and all the'regions' of the universe. So we cannot \"set eyes on\" the universe,as our space travellers in recent times set eyes on the earth asspaceship. In fact, the universe is not even conceptualisable, or \"image-29 Healing: A Holistic Approach able\" pictorially. We cannot stand outside the universe to see it 'objectively.' The whole that we want to understand must integrate what we perceive at all the three levels, the sub-atomic, the ordinary and thecosmic/universal. But our perception of our own selves uses adifferent mode from that which we use at the micro, macro andmega levels. Any notion of the whole must include the one in whomthe notion functions, the 'subjectivity' of the perceiver or conceiver,which effects and shapes the perception at all four levels - micro,macro, mega and mind. The net results of the above observations is that the whole is not available, either to conceptualisation or to descriptive symbolic orlinguistic depiction. Neither concept nor language can grasp the whole.If this hard fact is not firmly grasped, we are likely to fall into newdelusions about our knowledge and concepts. It is my humble view that Fritjof Capra, in his 'The Turning Point' falls precisely into this trap. After having exposed the faults of amechanistic model of reality, he opts finally for \"the Systems View oflife\", seeming life on the model of a \"self organizing system.\" Sincehe includes the environments as part of the dynamic system, he givesthe impression that he is dealing with the whole. 2 Wholeness reflects itself at various levels, but cannot be objectified in any situation. The whole is the Absolute Subject, in which allsubjectivity and all objectivity ultimately merge and from which they (subjectivity and objectivity) constantly emerge at various levels. Even that statement must be qualified with the further statement that it isonly a conceptual linguistic statement, and therefore does not 'describe'the whole. Once conceptual image which the Physicist David Bohm 3 has popularized is the \"Holoverse.\" Conceptual images can sometimeshelp us to discern the defects of other conceptual images and Bohm'sconcept of the whole as a Holoverse is eminently useful in this sense.The analogy for the whole is taken from the recent technology ofholography, 4 a three dimensional photography technique using wave30 Healing: A Holistic Approach properties of light rather than the straight line propagation of light used by conventional lens photography. The important feature of thehologram is not merely its three-dimensional perspective, but the factthat each part contains the whole in miniature. Since the holographanalogy for reality suggests a static condition, Bohm uses theexpression 'holo-movement.' His conception of the whole is in termsof a multi-layered order which is dynamic. Life is one of the layers ofsuch order, consciousness another layer of different complexity, andordinary inorganic matter a third order within the system, whichincluded many orders unknown to us as yet. Bohm is sanguine in hisbelief that the various layers of dynamic reality in the 'holoverse' isin principle knowable by us. Brilliant as the Bohmian concept of the universe as a mutually related multi-layered web of structures and patterns of dynamicenergies, it remains a concept and as such inadequate to depict reality. We humans, however, are conceptual - linguistic creatures, and bytraining we have become incapable of dealing with reality withoutconcept and language. We should at this point reflect also on the question of the adequacy of our two-dimensional logic of non-contradiction to cope with thewhole; the rules for valid inference, if confined to such a two-dimensional or binary logic or a prepositional calculus using BooleanAlgebra, can only lead to inescapable contradictions. Scholars like Bohm and Capra, though aware of the fact that the binary logic and calculus have their roots in the mechanistic Newtonianperspective, sometimes proceed as if a conceptual mathematicalrepresentation of reality was possible. Bohm discusses the problemof language in his Wholeness and the Implicate Order 5 and comes out with some profound statements, e.g. that language itself is a humanfunction which ought to be studied scientifically, and that languagedistorts when we take nouns (subject and object) more seriously thanthe verb (predicate). Language, the subject-verb-object mode, is oneof the causes of the experience of fragmentation. Bohm offers uspractically a new language called the rheo-mode, which emphasizesverbs, dynamic processes, rather than things or nouns conceivedstatically.31 Healing: A Holistic Approach But this does not solve the language problem. Even in the rheo mode, there is the temptation to mistake the map for the country, thelanguage for the truth. Of course, Bohm admits that Reality andKnowledge are processes, as has been held from Heraclitus to White-head. \"All is flux\", including knowledge, thought, statement, andlanguage. Becoming is being. Knowledge too is a flowing river, adynamic field. Even this writing is part of that flow. Bohm clearlysees this. But for him, the key question is: \"Can we be aware of theever-changing and flowing reality of this actual process ofknowledge?\" 6 In other words, the best we can do is to be aware that awareness is a stream that keeps on flowing. Bohm has learnedmuch from non-western cultures, but was still a westerner all thesame in his sanguine confidence about conscious awareness ofawareness as a flowing stream as the best we can do in knowingreality as a whole. This certainly is not the view in an eastern way of dealing with Reality, such as Madhyamika Buddhism. This way begins bydistinguishing between the \"Two Truths\" - one Truth of worldlyconvention and the other of ultimate meaning. According toChandrakirti, the worldly convention ( samvrti ) ( mithya-samvrti ), depending on the correctness or otherwise of the perception and the reasoning process. But even a\"true\" worldly convention or samvrti has only a \"dependently co- originating\" or pratitya-samutpanna reality. As Nagarjuna states it. The reality of all beings Neither arises nor passes away......Where there is quiescence of mental activity.There the need for discourse ceases. 7 David Bohms's rheo-mode of linguistic expression is still within that samvrti which is the result of discursive mental activity. Only when that activity is quietened, and the \"thundering silence\" of theSunyata mode is experienced, there can be perception of the ultimate truth, in which the knower and the known are experienced as one,the knowledge itself being that experience. Wholeness, when fullyexperienced, is an experience of liberating union, not of conceptual32 Healing: A Holistic Approach awareness, however dynamic that awareness may be. The west now puts a premium on dynamic as opposed to static. But there is a possiblecessation of awareness, in which such dichotomies as static anddynamic are themselves surpassed. It is, for the Buddhist, nirvana , the blowing out of the analytical consciousness, where awarenessitself is transcended in the liberating experience of the whole. Can Christians reconcile themselves with such a perception? Is this not monism , advaita and all that kind of heresy? I personally do not think so. I think the Christian perception of reality is both holisticand apophatic as in Buddhist philosophy. Especially in the EasternChristian tradition we always conceive the Creator with the Creationas a single reality within which the created order subsists only by thewisdom, will and word of the Creator, who continually sustains andguides it. And the cosmos without the Creator is not a whole. Thewhole cannot be conceptually grasped. We can only realize our owndependence on the Creator and in that realisation find meaning andsustenance. We cannot know the whole, but the whole makes itpossible for us to fit into it, and there to find bliss and peace. Notes 1. Fontana Paperbacks, London, 1983.

Press, Albany, 1989.34 Healing: A Holistic Approach Holistic Health and Healing The word 'holistic' defies definition. Different people use it in different ways. In the field of health and healing, some people think of holistic medicine primarily in terms of taking the body and the mind of ahuman person together as a single whole entity and not as two. Thisis legitimate, since modern western medicine, when it went scientificin the last century, set aside the 'mind' as a separate entity to betaken up later by specialists like psychologists and psychiatrists, leavingthe body for the physician and the surgeon. The new psycho-somatic approach, or mind-body medicine, which as a scientific trend developed approximately three decades ago, washowever only a stage on the way to what we now regard as holistichealth and healing. There have been important developments since medical scientists began taking the mind-body problem seriously. One has seen thewidespread use by therapists of practices like bio-feedback,meditation, relaxation, and even alternative systems of medicine likeAyurveda, Homeopathy, Chinese or Taoist systems includingAcupuncture and Acupressure, Tibetan medicine, Herbal remediesand so on. Another has been the development of new \"cross-disciplines\" like psycho-neuro-immunology. There have been manyclinical reports of strange wart cures and placebo effects which cannotbe accounted for by ordinary medical science, It is now fairly wellestablished that factors once regarded as 'purely mental', likeperceptions, beliefs, emotions, thoughts and attitudes, have a definiterole in the healing process. It seems, however, that we need to go one step farther, in order to get at what we mean today by Holistic Health and Healing, not somuch to define, as to depict some of its main characteristics. I. Planet, Person and Paradigm Shift The first thing we have to note is that neither the human person, nor the planet earth on which the person is totally dependent, exists35 Healing: A Holistic Approach or can subsist in isolation. Neither one can be understood except as part of larger systems of which it is only a subsystem. The very word \"person\" is a relational term. Human persons, as far as we know, can be formed and developed only through interactionwith other persons and social groups like family, relatives, peer groups,societies, religious groups, national populations etc. Even if we takethe human species as a whole, that whole is in turn dependent onother wholes - like for instance the system of nature or the biosphereas such, which includes air and water, earth and sea, mountains andrivers, sun and moon, and so on. Similarly the very word 'planet' indicates that our earth is a satellite unit of the solar system, existing only as its subsystem, dependent onit for its very sustenance and energy, interacting with other planets inthe system as well as with its own moon, and never in isolation fromthe system. In holistic health and healing we need to pay constantattention to the system of relationships, which play a most significantrole both in the causing of disease and in the healing of persons. So far we are on fairly undisputed territory, though current medical science does not take all these factors into account. We need,however, to go even further in our envisioning of the whole of realityof which we are a subsystem. There is, as of now, no single paradigm of the whole of reality on which scientists and other theoreticians agree. This is especially so ifwe can step outside the bounds of western civilisation and westernscientific thought in envisioning the reality process. Negatively, we can say that mechanical or static models of person, Planet or Reality as a whole will not do. But even dynamic models areusually conceived in time-space, subject-object categories andframeworks. In fact our human language seems hardly capable ofgoing beyond these. Past, though the present, to future (time), andlocality (space) seem unavoidable even in a dynamic paradigm. Extensionin time and space is an aspect of the reality we inhabit and experience.Change (in time) and movement (in space) appear to be foundationalfor person, planet and universe alike. Paradigms can only be maps;they should not be mistaken for the territories they map.36 Healing: A Holistic Approach II. Quanta and Consciousness But there are two interconnected aspects of our human experience where time and space take on unusual characteristics. In quantumreality and in the understanding of our own human consciousness,time and space behave extraordinarily. And these are quite importantfor any paradigm which should undergird the theory of a new medicalscience. I propose here about Holistic Health and Healing. But weshall refer in ordinary language to some of the unusual discoveries ofmodern physics which have relevance for medical science and healingtherapies. While mechanical causality may have helped us and can still help us understand many phenomena, there are other areas of experiencewhere the cause-effect connection, within time and space, with thecause preceding in time and acting through space to produce theeffect, cannot be established or even postulated. In the area of health and healing too, not all healing can be causally understood or controlled. Or if causality is to be postulated, it has tobe in terms of 'non-local causation', i.e. without any lapse of timebetween cause and effect, without the passing of any message throughany observable medium from cause to effect. Consciousness or mind cannot be spatially localized. The human neuro-biological system does not seem to have a centre either in thebrain or anywhere else in the individual human body. It has a qualitythat transcends space and time; it is more corporate than individual,ultimately unitary, able to act at a distance, and to travel withoutlapse of time. The healing power of mind or consciousness has beenclinically observed in all forms of healing by faith and prayer, in placeboeffects, in some alternative systems of healing etc. The biologicalpath by which the causal chain acts may not be directly traceable,but the healing effects are evident in too many cases to be dismissedas merely anecdotal. Any new revision of medical theory will have totake these factors into account. Our growing acquaintance with reality in the quantal realm has not yet taken us to the point where we can describe that reality37 Healing: A Holistic Approach satisfactorily in our time-and-space conceptual language. We now know that we do not know reality itself, but only know our perceptionof it. All our descriptions, measurements and mathematical formulaerelate only to the perceptions. Quantum reality cannot be adequatelydescribed in the categories of Newtonian mechanics. Some things however, we can affirm, as paradoxical indications of our quantum experience. Reality is interconnected everythingseems, ultimately, in immediate touch with everything else. Humanbeings cannot stand outside reality and look at it from outside; theyare on the inside as participants; they are part of the reality theyobserve, and partially shape that reality in the very act of observing.Our experience of time and space and causality at the macro levelhas no validity at other levels of our experience. In the healing processtoo some of the observed phenomena have more affinity with thequantal than the mechanical realm. III. Insight as Healing Agent In psychiatry and psychoanalysis, the healing role of insight has long been recognized. The patient's self understanding is what thetherapist works on, in order to induce new insights which give thecapacity to solve problems and predicaments in a new way. In ordinary healing, however, the role of insight is not as widely recognised. The whole Indian religious tradition is based on insight asthe way to deliverance or moksha through self-realisation. Even theinsights coming from ordinary knowledge and from scientific enquirycan lead to stress reduction and thus contribute to healing. Thedisciplined pursuit of science, philosophy, law or other academicdisciplines, of arts such as sculpturing, painting, music and so on, andeven of practical arts like weaving, cooking, interior decoration,pottery etc., so long as they provide for some sort of disciplined totalinvolvement, can be helpful in the process of healing. A new medical theory should take into account the role of insight as well as that of aesthetic experience of true beauty, as positivefactors in therapy.38 Healing: A Holistic Approach IV. Relationship, Faith and Community Relationships are central in Holistic Healing, and that at many levels. People are today talking about Transpersonal Medicine, asthey talked yesterday about Transpersonal Psychology. First, there is the healer-healed relationship, or doctor-patient relationship. Love, empathy and compassion on the part of the healertowards the patient and some response from the patient to that lovecan generate strong healing energies which make the work of healingquicker. Doctors and nurses who genuinely care make all thedifference in the healing process. This may be the opposite of thetime honoured idea of scientific dispassion. But healing is more artthan science. Much ill health is due to isolation and alienation - the loneliness of not knowing that others care. And our present civilisation which putstoo much emphasis on each one doing his or her own thing, generatesloneliness in havoc-wreaking measure. Bolstering the individual egoand enhancing the strength of the person can both be futile if theseare not aspects of healthy and mutually self-giving social relationships,chronic loneliness, as distinct from cultivated and disciplined spiritualsolitude, can be toxic and generate morbidity. If the healer, by his/herlove, compassion and empathy, can bring the patient out of the morbidisolation of loneliness, the healing process would be remarkablyaccelerated. The second area of relationships is the whole community around the patient. This includes the physicians, surgeons, nurses and theparamedical personnel in the hospital, the patient's relatives, visitors,and even those who without actual face to face contact with thepatient and often even without the patient's knowledge, function as acommunity faithfully praying for the healing of the patient. The attitudes of those in direct contact with the patient, even over phone or through other message, are very important, for these cangenerate healing energy. But the faith of a community and its ferventand sustained prayer can definitely exercise high therapeutic efficacy.The prayer of a single person, in direct contact with the patient or39 Healing: A Holistic Approach without such contact, can also be immensely effective. There are secular substitutes for prayer available to agnostics: like positiveimagining, or intensely desiring and willing the healing of the patient. Even in these, a fundamental faith in the positive or beneficent aspect of reality is a precondition. The joint effort in prayer of morethan two people has always a special effectiveness. This is the mysteryof community. V . Touch and Ritual The idea of the \"healing touch\" has recently come into vogue, especially in nursing literature. It can also be the \"caring touch\" thatcommunicates to the patient as well as to members of the patient'sfamily the assurance of care and support. Medical practitioners andnurses have to break out of their self-image as technicians and becomewarm human beings, expending something of themselves in the actof caring. This cannot be mere mechanical touching, but the touchthat communicates confidence, warmth, reassurance, support andunderstanding, as well as respects the personhood and dignity of thepatient. Touching is communication, a most intimate form of communication. Therefore it is important that the other person'sprivacy and dignity is fully respected in the touch and that it does notbecome an intrusion. Nursing personnel have to be careful in keepingtheir professional dignity and yet being warmly humane, but the latteris an essential part of holistic healing. Another very effective form of touch is \"laying hands on by those who pray for the sick, and by faith healers. The hand becomes amedium through which healing forces transfer to the patient from thehealer. Usually the right hand of the healer is placed on the foreheador crown of the patient and a prayer is said, silently or audibly. Thepatient, usually with closed eyes, with faith, and in a spirit of receptivemeditation, receives the healing energies. Ritual as a healing technique has for long been difficult to understand for the modern western rational mind. The EuropeanEnlightenment of the 18th century made western an rather anticlerical40 Healing: A Holistic Approach and antiritual. But new anthropological studies have begun to show that ritual plays a very major role in the social communication ofmodern humanity. Dr. Jeanne Achterberg, a forceful advocate ofholistic healing and especially of \"Transpersonal Medicine\" as a newsystem of healing has written a very perceptive article in a recent(winter 1992, Vol. 14, No. 3, pp. 158 ff) issue of Revision on \"Ritual:The Foundation for Transpersonal Medicine.\" Ritual is a participatory community act, in which words, actions and symbols combine to communicate to the participant meaningwhich cannot be expressed in words alone. Long before the humanspecies acquired its language skill it has been using ritual as the modeof expressing meaning. In healing too, along with other forms ofinterpersonal relationships, ritual plays a significant role. Jesus, the Great Healer, sometimes healed by the mere word, sometimes even without a word. At other times, he made mud withdust and saliva and applied it as salve in the eye of the man bornblind, asking him to go and wash in the pool of Shiloam, or asked the paralytic to pick up his bedding and walk. The ancient churches developed special rituals for the healing of the sick. A modern surgeonin Medical City Dallas Hospital may light a blue sulphur flame in theoperation theatre and recite an abracadabra to heal a patient whosedisease could not be diagnosed or cured by all the complex techniquesof modern medicine (See Larry Dossey, Space, Time and Medicine , 1982). The role of ritual in healing cannot be neglected in any newtheory of healing and health. VI. Alternative Techniques of Healing Many alternative techniques of healing have recently caught the attention of the general public, both within western culture and inother cultures. Clinically successful, these alternative techniques implya theoretical framework which is not always clearly articulated, butwhich seems radically different from that of western medical science. Dr. Irving Dardik of New Jersey has, for example, clinically demonstrated non invasive techniques for curing chronic hepatitisand other similar ailments. Dr. Dardik, well trained in western medicine41 Healing: A Holistic Approach and surgery, explains his technique theoretically in terms of restoring certain basic stimulation-relaxation rhythms in the human system tobe in harmony with the larger reality system, which he conceives ascomplexes of energy undulations. Another example comes from the modern Prophet Mokichi Okada of Japan, who developed the healing art of Johrei, based on spiritualenergy, as one aspect of a whole complex of holistic healingtechniques, including exposure to beauty, organic farming, andabstaining from chemical drugs and fertilizers. His theoretical basisis the clear conviction that the sensible world is undergirded anddirected by the spiritual universe. His system is now practised inmany countries by his disciples. The theoretical basis of the western system called Homeopathy is worth examining again, free from the bitterness and rancour of theearlier debate between Homeopathy and Allopathy. Similarexamination of the theoretical basis of Chinese, Indian and Tibetansystems may reveal insights important for a holistic paradigm of health and healing. VII. Towards the Making of a Theory All that has been stated above does not imply by any means that we should completely abandon all the ground so painstakingly coveredby modern medicine in the scientific analysis of human anatomy,pathology, and therapy. However nearly all aspects of that analysiswill have to be radically re-examined to see if they are based onmistaken assumptions about the nature of reality and the nature ofthe human, as well as about health and healing. There are problems about current medical theory and practice which we can no longer afford to ignore. One could mention several: a. the increasingly exorbitant, and for many unaffordable cost of medical care; b. diseases and ill health induced by hospitals, doctors and Pharmaceuticals; c. the unholy alliance among the health insurance business, the42 Healing: A Holistic Approach medical profession and the pharmaceutical industry working against the interests of the patient; d. the arrogant exclusion of all alternate therapies and healing systems by a dominant medical ideology which claims that italone is scientific; e. the Cartesian, mechanistic, reductionistic, individualistic understanding of the human person on which medical scienceis still based; f. the chemical-bacterial theory of disease and therapy;g. the growing mechanisation and technologisation of diagnosis and therapy; h. the increasingly poor quality of human relationships prevailing between healers and patients. We will have to question our ideas and assumptions about nutrition and healthy nourishment of mind and body. We will have to askwhether our so-called scientific, mechanized, chemical-fertilizer-pesticide farming methods lead to important health problems forhumanity and for the rest of the biosphere or life-community. We willhave to ask questions about fossil fuel combustion, carbon dioxideand ozone production, toxic waste disposal, usage of radioactivecompounds and so on. We will also have to ask questions about the way we live together and deal with each other, for that is the most fundamental part of thehuman health. Justice, peace, and a life-enhancing environment areaspects of human health care. Economics and politics cannot be easilyseparated from health and health care. Reducing holistic health to transpersonal medicine can hardly allow us to deal with all the problems and issues we have listed in thispaper. Neither the mind-body approach nor transpersonal Medicinecan be sufficiently comprehensive to deal with holistic health. As we stated at the beginning there is as yet neither a satisfactory definition of the term \"holistic healing\", nor an adequate paradigm ofreality within which a new theory of health and healing can be built up.43 Healing: A Holistic Approach Reflection reveals that wholes can be of various kinds: a. the original whole from which everything comes to be and on which everything is contingent, and without which no partcan exist or subsist; b. an organic whole in which the component parts can function only in the framework of the whole and not apart from it, eg.the human or animal body and its organs; c. a systemic whole: an open system like the planet earth or the human person which exists only in a complex web ofrelationships with many other entities which together with itconstitute a whole; the planet may or may not be aware ofthese relationships, but does respond to them. In the case ofthe person he/she may be not consciously aware of all theserelationships; but the person's existence is significantlyaffected by them nevertheless. d. the whole of a particular entity: eg. the whole world, the whole country, the whole bottle, the whole leg, etc. All four of these aspects of wholeness have their own significance for the healing process. The English word 'whole' is etymologically related to health and healing. It has more of a qualitative than a quantitative sense. OneEnglish dictionary gives the meanings of the adjective health; to be made whole is to be healed. The Holistic Approach is in principle opposed to all Reductionist understandings of the human person and of the human eco-socio-bio-physical endowment. The positive value of specialised trainingand study is recognized; at the same time the dangers in thefragmentation reduction on which all specialisation is based shouldalso be understood and provided for. Modern Science itself isintrinsically reductionistic, since it can deal with only sensibles,measurables and with what is repeatedly experimentable. Realityalways transcends the categories of modern science.44 Healing: A Holistic Approach The Holistic Approach centres around human relations, harmonies, attitudes, meaning-perceptions, faith, hope and love, spiritual disciplineslike prayer and meditation, environmental improvement, andcommunity support as fundamental in the healing process.Unfortunately, Western Allopathic Medicine, when it decided in thelast century to be strictly scientific, took over a reductionist paradigmof reality from the then prevailing science, which excluded thesefactors from the healing process. The 19th century scientific worldview, which even people like Sigmund Freud blindly accepted as theirtheoretical basis, saw reality as composed exclusively of strictlymeasurable, mechanically structured, observable, matter and force,or Kraft und Staff as the Germans called it. Medical Science has shown a great unwillingness to examine this its precariously dated reductionist theoretical foundation. MedicalEducation does not equip medical graduates to be capable offundamental reflection and theoretical reconstruction. Such reflectionand reconstruction of theory are urgently needed, as a radically newbasis for a radically new type of health care and healing. Theformulation of such an alternate paradigm of Reality and thearticulation of a new healing praxis based on that paradigm are amongthe major objectives of the Holistic Health Movement. We are far from having arrived at a consensus among those thinking enquirers within and without the medical profession aboutthe basic nature of such an alternate paradigm. The formulation ofsuch a new paradigm demands several qualifications on the part ofthose working on it. In addition to the awareness of the problemsassociated with current medical theory and practice, they have alsoto be aware of the discussion in recent western (English-speaking,German and French) Philosophy of Science which reveals theprecarious truth status of modern science itself. They would alsohave to have some acquaintance with alternate medical systems andtheir theoretical foundations eg., Taoist, Tibetan, Native American,Homeopathic, Ayurvedic and other systems. Some knowledge of thehealing methods of unconventional healers will also help. The basic problems with all paradigms or models of reality is that45 Healing: A Holistic Approach they are pictures: space-time, subject-object, human conceptions of some reality in our experience: David Bohm's Implicate order ofHolographic Reality in the Rheomode with its soma and signa modes of matter and mood; Rupert Hierarchy Selves\" Bateson's Universe andPerson as analogously evolving through stochastic spurts, which isbasically a Consciousness model of the Universe shared by LarryDossey, Willis Harmon and many others; the Energy wave model ofIrving Dardik; the Buddhist perception of the Universe as Sunya- Pratitya-Samutpanna or V oid-conditonally-originate; Chinese Hua- Yen or universalmutual interpenetration with Mikichi Okada; the Ousia- Energeia-Diastema dynamic universe model of 4th century Christian Father Gregory of Nyssa; and perhaps many others that could bementioned including the Dharmic and Sankhya models of Indianmetaphysics. All of these are dynamic, holistic models; but they aremodels, paradigms, pictures drawn from human experience and humanconceptualisation of Reality. A paradigm is a paradigm - a working model that can be more or less helpful than others in dealing with reality. They are all maps,which we can easily mistake for reality itself. Reality escapes mappingor exact paradigm representation. The Holistic Paradigm can thusbe only a working model, not a picture of Reality itself. It will alsohave to be revised in course of time, as our perceptions change andmore and more anomalies between paradigm and reality come tolight. Without a provisional New Paradigm for medical theory andpractice we cannot proceed very far however. There is not muchuse in just going on tinkering with the old and familiar paradigmuncritically drawn from the obsolete world view of the science of theend of the last century. Knowing the limitations of any paradigm wemust nevertheless strive for a new paradigm which will facilitatemore humane, more just, less damaging and more holistic systems ofhealth care. Perhaps the building up of an adequate theory will have to wait,46 Healing: A Holistic Approach until more significant advances are made in healing practice. In the meantime, some things can be done towards building up a theory: a. build up a network of competent and creative healers from all over the world and from all cultures and provide themwith a framework of mutual contact; b. begin a multi-language journal, to begin with a quarterly, in English, French, Japanese, German, Arabic and Spanish atleast, to publish high quality research papers on clinicalexperiences of holistic health and healing as well as ofalternate systems of medicine; c. convoke regional conferences on holistic health in the regional languages, and make available their insights to the widernetwork; d. those involved in medical education explore ways (for example holding seminars and discussion sessions in medical schools)of how the medical training curriculum can be revised tobring it more in line with the insights of holistic health andhealing; e. seek to use the resources of both the World Health Organisation and the Council for International Organisationsof Medical Sciences (CIOMS) to deepen and promote theideas of holistic health and healing, and to make the WHOitself move from the concept of Health Delivery to the conceptof Holistic Healing; f. seek foundation grants to get a small but highly competent team of international experts to work on a research projectfor laying the foundations for a fresh theory of Holistic Healthand Healing. g. Create and fund a project for professional education and training in holistic health and healing, centrally as well asregionally and nationally, exploring possibilities of beginningthe pioneering with existing institutions of medical education.47 Healing: A Holistic Approach The Future of Health Care Allopathy or Western Medicine seems bound to recede, in the not too distant future, from its present dominance and monopoly of healing.The signs are unmistakable, though very few doctors and surgeonsseem to be able to read the signs the way I do. I personally attributethat unwillingness or inability to their training and mind set. We have briefly stated some of the reasons in our consultation papers on MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY AND ALTERNATIVESYSTEMS OF HEALING. But they bear restatement. First, the cost of western medical care has generally become exorbitant, and often beyond the means of a majority of the world'speople. The more technologized the methods of diagnosis and therapy,the higher the cost. Art Buchwald's humorous column appearing inthe Hindu of Sunday, October 16, 1994, is not just humour, but acutting social satire, which deserves to be heeded. The point is this:the patient or patient's relatives have, especially in the USA, little sayin how much the diagnosis and therapy would cost; the doctor is held by the fear of being used against for not using all possible techniquesof diagnosis and therapy; he therefore protects himself and prescribesexpensive testing and treatment, and most people find that the* healthinsurance is exhausted before the treatment leads to cure. Peopleare going bankrupt, or have to sell property to pay their medical bills.The situation is not radically different in many West European countries,though the insurance racket is perhaps less complicated. In India too,hospital expenses are a heavy burden on most domestic budgets.This has to change. Second, we have enough documentation about the menacing growth of doctor-induced or hospital-induced pathology in allcountries. The statistics on hiatrogenic ailments and hospitalisation isfrightening. One takes great risks today in going to an Allopathicdoctor for treatment. He may meddle with your body by chemical orsurgical intervention which results in unexpected new pathologicaldisturbances. There is great risk in western medical treatment asmany people in all countries, including the present writer, can easily48 Healing: A Holistic Approach testify. The doctor or hospital may be careless, negligent or ignorant; sometimes even callous; it is the patient who suffers consequently. Third, as Dr. Girija says in her article on \"The Crisis of Health Care\" in the same issue of the Hindu cited above, \"The news fromthe Western Medical front is ominous. We who are so used to lookingwestward for all kinds of miracle cures are in for a shock. It hasbeen recently reported that antibiotics have become increasinglyineffective. Many of the bacteria known to western doctors are saidto have developed resistance to several widely used antibiotics. Inthe U.S. in 1992 alone 13,300 hospital patients died of infections thatresisted every drug used. The crisis is serious enough for an Americandoctor to admit in a recent best-seller that western medicine'spurported triumph over infectious disease has become an illusion.\" The matter is more serious than what most people think. If the West is so scared of the Indian Plague outbreak, should we not beequally concerned about the West which should be declared aninfected territory with many strains of disease-causing bacteria against which there seems to be no remedy? Tuberculosis, Meningitis, Malaria and Gonorrhea can be caused by some of these resistant strains. The whole antibiotic culture, despite its achievement in saving many lives and healing many diseases previously thought to beuncurable, is certainly not an unmixed blessing, obviously. When webragged some decades ago about our overcoming to certain infectiousdiseases, we hardly envisaged a scenario where our over-use ofantibiotics leads to the generation of resistant strains of some of thedeadly bacteria - a scenario in which human beings could be\"overcome\" by bacteria resistant to all antibiotics infection by theseresistant strains should be viewed with as much alarm as the spreadof AIDS. In both cases inescapable and proximate death seems tobe the outcome. It is time that the medical system abandoned the easy path of prescribing antibiotics for everything, including for viral infections! Ifwe refuse to abandon this path catastrophe awaits us, globally. Fourth, there is the over-chemicalisation of the earth and of human49 Healing: A Holistic Approach bodies, as also of animal bodies. In the west, cattle are also often fed with chemicals and treated with antibiotics, which then get lodged inmilk and meat. Without knowing it we may be consuming more thana fair share of antibiotics, through our normal food intake. I am toldthat milk is certified to be saleable in the USA even if it containstraces of up to 80 different antibiotics. Through chemical fertilisersand chemically processed farm feed, we pump in tremendous quantitiesof chemicals both into the earth and into the human body. Foodpreservatives stuff more chemicals into the human body, and eveninto the earth through the disposal system. Chemicals are changingnot only the human body, but also the human mind. The current upsurgeof mindless violence in our societies may be at least in part due to theover-chemicalisation of body and brain. The life environment is itselfruined by over-chemicalisation of land, air and water. Only acivilisational change, including radical transformation of the industrial-technological culture and of the agricultural, nutritional and medicalsystems, can rescue us from this sad predicament. Fifth we see a depersonalisation of healing, happening in the western system, due to overreliance on technology. Some peopleeven envisage a situation where we would no longer need, in mostillness to consult medical doctors at all; a home computer can connectto a central information network, and by feeding in the symptomscan get both diagnosis and prescriptions from the central computer.That may be quite desireable in certain ailments; but certainly healingis largely a matter of life imparting life, not machines and chemicalsdispensing health in do-it yourself packages. The human element ofthe healing community is central and vital to human health. We cannotafford to mechnanise and technologise it, without disastrousconsequences to the very structure of human personality. We haveto arrest the over-technologisation of diagnosis and therapy, not merelybecause the technology is expensive; more because it is frighteninglydehumanising. Sixth, we need to re-examine the near monopoly of the western medical system in the health care ministry. The Chinese are nowwaking up to this problem and the government is actively promotingAcupuncture, Acupressure, Herbal medicine, and other traditional50 Healing: A Holistic Approach Chinese healing systems. In Japan there is a whole movement for activating traditional Chinese and Japanese ways of healing, and tomake them more scientific and efficient. The traditional Chinese wordfor good health 'chi' and its Japanese equivalent 'ki' are being revivedand applied to new techniques like acupuncture using laser beamsinstead of needles (High Genki) and so on. Our own Deepak Choprain California has managed to hit the New York Times bestseller listwith his Ageless Body, Timeless Mind - A Practical Alternative to Growing Old (New York, 1993), which not only proposes Yoga and Ayurveda as alternative healing systems, but also proposes a radicallynew perspective on the human reality and the process of aging andhealing. Chopra, a journalist who later was trained as a physician,has quite convincingly argued that the very world-view and view ofhumanity that prevails in Western Civilisation is at fault for many ofthe defects of the Allopathic system. The US National Institutes ofHealth have now (in 1993) by Congressional action, set up a 25member Advisory Panel and an Office of Alternative Medicine. Itseems Deepak Chopra is on the Panel. Our own central government is not totally inactive in the matter of alternative systems of medicine and healing. The Indian Council ofMedical Research is currently examining 30 herbal based substancesfor possible treatment of AIDS. We have now the prestigiousDhanvantari Award instituted in 1973. In 1975 and 1984 the awardwent to two Ayurvedic physicians, Dr. Shiv Sharma and Dr. HariduttShastri; in 1979 and 1987 it went to two Homoeopaths, Dr. DiwanHarish Chand and Dr. B. N. Chakravarti, and finally to NaturopathJ. M. Jussawalla in 1989. There are Yogic/Naturopathic institutes inDelhi, Mongher, Bombay, Poona and Bangalore as well as elsewhere.Even abroad, the University of Turino in Italy, for example, has startedAyurveda courses with Indian collaboration. Our Vice-President Shri K. R. Narayanan in a speech in Delhi advocated greater priority to traditional medicine (Indian Express 7August 17, 1994). Dr. Jasbir Singh Bajaj, Member, PlanningCommission, recently urged the 450,000 Allopathic doctors registeredwith the Medical Council of India to join with the 550,000 other healerson the rolls of the Central Council for Indian Medicine. That would51 Healing: A Holistic Approach make it a round one million of healers. The response so far from the MCI has been less than enthusiastic, because most western trainedmedical doctors hold to rather condescending and stereotypedgeneralisations about other healers. The Indian Health Ministry has now a special cell for alternative systems of healing, as well as a separate department of Ayurvedawith an initial investment of Rs. 26.5 crore. But all this is but a smallbeginning of the radical process of change required: mainly bringingup the standards in training and practice, and thereby raising thepresent low standing of alternative medicine; and then starting clinicsin urban and rural centres where many systems of therapy aresimultaneously available with high quality and low cost, to be chosenin each individual case between patient/patients' people and adiagnostic team functioning at the Clinic, changing the therapy whennecessary. Despite better training facilities for Ayurveda and Homoeopathy, the standards in these alternative systems remain pathetically uneven. Even Ayurveda, badly practised, can do harm, as the present writer has discovered to his hurt. Besides, practitioners of Ayurveda are tooeasily tempted to use their license to dabble amateurishly in westernmedicine. Government will have to be more rigorous in monitoringthe practice of medicine in all systems. Our Medical education inAyurveda, Homoeopathy, Acupuncture and Siddha Vaidya will soonhave to be brought up to a higher standard in special joint (with westernmedicine) training centres for these systems; it is absolutely necessaryto give some training in these alternative systems to students ofAllopathic medicine as well. The latter may be one way of raisingthe standards everywhere. Dr. Girija may be exaggerating the problem in her concluding paragraph in the Hindu article cited above: The writing is on the wall. The current crisis in Western medicine ought to remind us that our blind and continued reliance on this aliensystem of medicine can only lead to inevitable catastrophe. The onlyway out of this morass is to beat a hasty retreat and take to ourtraditional and time-tested systems of health care and medicine which52 Healing: A Holistic Approach have stood us in good stead for thousands of years. We can ignore this simple truth only at our own peril. \"Beating a hasty retreat\" from Allopathy and \"taking to our traditional systems\" is not my solution to the problem which is veryreal. We will have to be more sophisticated than that. Medical anthropology and theories of health and healing Seventh, there is the large and difficult question of the theoretical foundations of modern western medicine. Those foundations aredifficult to identify, because so much is assumed and so little clearlyexpressed about it. The western medical system as we know it, is the product of two centuries of development, the same two centuries when modernscience and the present secular civilisation grew up. In fact westernmedical theory is inseparable from those two factors - first modernscience, with its conviction that a proper integration of experienceand reflection, using human critical rationality and technological skill,without the aid of Religion or Tradition, gives us full access not onlyto truth, but also to the manipulation of realities, including the body-mind of human beings, according to our desires and purposes; secondlya secular civilisation in which God has nothing to do with not onlymedicine and healing, but also with the educational system, with themedia including communication, literature and information, and withthe newly created institutions and theory of political economy, ofstatecraft and democratic representation of the people in decision-making as well as of power distribution and regulation. There is a shared world-view, not based on science, but held by scientists and others, often without criticial examination. DeepakChopra calls it the assumptions which form the bed-rock of our sharedworld-view, and goes on to list these assumptions thus: 1. There is an objective world independent of the observer, and our bodies are an aspect of this objective world. 2. The body is composed of clumps of matter separated from one another in time and space.53 Healing: A Holistic Approach 3. Mind and body are separate and independent from each other. 4. Materialism is primary, consciousness is secondary. In other words humans are physical machines that have learned to think. 5. Human awareness can be completely explained as the product of biochemistry. 6. As individuals, we are disconnected, self-contained entities.7. Our perception of the world is automatic and gives us an accurate picture of how things really are. 8. Our true nature is totally defined by the body, ego and personality. We are wisps of memories and desires enclosed in packages offlesh and bones. 9. Time exists as an absolute and we are captives of that Absolute. No one escapes the ravages of time. 10. Suffering is necessary - it is part of reality. We are inevitable victims of sickness aging and death. (Ageless, Body, Timeless Mind , op. cit. p. 4) Deepak Chopra goes on to offer us ten alternative assumptions for \"a new paradigm.\" These new assumptions of the new paradigm,Chopra admits 7 \"are also just creations of the human mind, but theyallow us much more freedom and power.\" These are \"the makingsof a new reality, yet all are grounded in the discoveries of quantumphysics made almost a hundred years ago.\" The seeds of this newparadigm were thus planted by Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg and otherpioneers of quantum physics. In other words, the new paradigm whichChopra proposes to us is still a science-based world view; onlydifference is that it is not the obsolete world view of NewtonianPhysics, but the current and modern one of Quantum Physics. I willpresent to you his ten new assumptions for what they are worth, andthen offer my own brief commentary, based both on the new scienceand the ancient traditions of humanity. Here are the ten newassumptions in Chopra's own words: 1. The physical world, including our bodies is a response of the54 Healing: A Holistic Approach observer. We create our bodies as we create the experience of our world. 2. In their essential state, our bodies are composed of energy and information, not solid matter. This energy and information is anoutcropping of infinite fields of energy and information spanning theuniverse. 3. The mind and body are inseparable one. The unity that is 'me' separates into two streams of experience. I experience the subjectivestream as thoughts, feelings and desires. I experience the objectivestream as my body. At a deeper level, however, the two streamsmeet at a single creative source. It is from this source that we aremeant to live. 4. The biochemistry of the body is a product of awareness. Beliefs, thoughts and emotions create the chemical reactions that uphold lifein every cell. An aging cell is the end product of awareness that hasforgotten how to remain new. 5. Perception appears to be automatic, but in fact it is a learned phenomenon. The world you live in, including the experience of yourbody, is completely dictated by how you learned to perceive it. If youchange your perception, you change the experience of your bodyand your world. 6. Impulses of intelligence create your body in new forms every second. What you are is the sum total of these impulses, and bychanging their patterns, you will change. 7. Although each person seems separate and independent, all of us are connected patterns of intelligence that govern the wholecosmos. Our bodies are part of universal body, our minds an aspectof a universal mind. 8. Time does not exist as absolute, but only as eternity. Time is quantified eternity, timelessness chopped up into bits and pieces(second, hours, days, years) by us. What we call linear time is areflection of how we perceive change. If we could perceive thechangeless, time would cease to exist as we know it. We can learn tostart metabolizing non-change, eternity, the absolute. By doing that,55 Healing: A Holistic Approach we will be ready to create the physiology of immortality. 9. Each of us inhabits a reality living beyond all change. Deep inside us, unknown to the five senses, is an innermost core of being,a field of non-change that creates personality, ego and body. Thisbeing is our essential state - it is who we really are. 10. We are not victims of aging, sickness, and death. These are part of the scenery, not the seer, who is immune to any form ofchange. This seer is the spirit, the expression of eternal being. (Op. cit. pp. 5-7) Deepak Chopra claims that all of these statements are grounded in the discoveries of quantum physics made almost a hundred yearsago. I have difficulty in accepting that claim, for I detect manyelements brought in from the ancient tradition of Upanishadic orVedantic thought. I am not yet ready to accept the agelessness of thebody. Neither am I able to phantasize a world within history whereno one gets old. At the moment I cannot hear Quantum Physicstelling me that the experience of a nonchanging reality lying beyondall change would give me the ability to control change. The name forsuch claims is not science but speculation. Deepak's problem alwaysseems to be the tendency to be carried away by a little scientificknowledge, into unbridled enthusiasm especially when playing to theAmerican gallery. Hitting the New York Times Bestseller List is noguarantee of the truth of the contents of a book. It means largely thatit is written to meet the requirements of an American Bestseller. Butthere is much in it with which one can enthusiastically agree: mind-body unity, the unity and interconnectedness of all reality, includingknower, known and knowledge, that life is essentially a dance, theplay of vibrations, the radical and basic unreliability of the five sensesand sense-perception, that time-space is not absolute, that causalitycan be nonlocal or transcending time and space. Science does notprove these things to me. I recognise that presently available scientificdata do not generally contradict these convictions. The Immune System - Key to Healing and Health The human immune system is the key to the new understanding56 Healing: A Holistic Approach of health and healing. But we seem to have inherited distorted perceptions of the function of this system. Our traditional paradigmfor understanding the human immune system is that of a well equippedand massive army, armed with white corpuscles and antigens, standingready to wage battle against any alien invasion in the human body.We conceive the function of the immune system to be basicallydefensive militantly so. Our knowledge of the human immune system has grown dramatically in the last couple of decades: first because of the riseand development of a new composite discipline called Psycho-Neuro-Immunology or PNI; second because in the attempt to overcome therejection by the body of alien organ transplants, medical science hadto struggle hard to find ways of suppressing the immune system inorder to enable the body to take the transplant. Today we are moreready to see the truth of Deepak Chopra's Vedantic Scientificstatement that the subjective and the objective streams of ourexperience both stem from the common origin of both, the true innercore of our being, which is timeless and unchanging. However thatbe, it seems now evident that the core of our identity as a uniquehuman being is the immune system, which as the guardian of ourunique identity, rejects the \"other\", the alien transplant. I am indebtedto Dr. Verma, former Director of NIMHANS in Bangalore, for thatprecious insight about the Immune System as the guardian of ourunique identity. But the immune system is more than merely the guard and defender of our unique identity. It is also the Master Healer within us. It is themost technically advanced healing centre in the Universe, equippedwith all the tools needed for both diagnosis and therapy, if only wewill listen to it and let it do its work. That is the principle on whichwhole systems like Homeopathy and Naturopathy are based lettingthe body-mind do its own healing, while we stand by and help in theprocess by boosting the immune system, by cleansing anddeitoxification of the body, by providing a wholesome environmentfor the organism to breathe and live in, and by stimulating andexercising various parts of the body. Everyone knows that theHomeopathic system is totally based on the natural immune system57 Healing: A Holistic Approach doing the healing. The same is true to a large extent, of other alternative systems like Acupuncture/acupressure and Pranic Healing as wellas Macrobiotics. Healings as Rectifying Relationships The major defect of western medicine is its taking the human body in isolation both for diagnosis and therapy. The living humanperson is a subsystem within a large complex system of relationships.Some of the most obvious elements on which the human subsystemis ever dependent are earth, fire, air and water, trees and animals,rain-clouds, the sun and moon, food and drink, the family ambiance,work satisfaction and social acceptance. But western medicine hardlyever takes these into consideration for diagnosis or therapy. Our inner core which we call the Self, is both a giver and a taker. Alas, too often it tries to take more than it gives. It is greedy andacquisitive, either exploitative or parasitic, either dominating orenslaved, and but seldom caring for others or nurturing the needy; itexpects others to fit into one's own world, and when they do not,react violently and in anger or frustration.When relations are ruined,health goes to ruin as well. The greatest source of pathology in thehuman is the disoriented inner core, bent on making itself the centreof everything, seeking to dominate and exploit all, hating those whodo not respond, and ruining relationships. Healing follows restored and right relationships. The central defect of Deepak Chopra's work is the failure to take relationships as central,and its focussing too heavily on the individual and his/her overcomingaging and sickness, beating entropy and death. One's own inner coreis important but it does not exist in isolation from other people's innercores. True relationship is community, where the centre is not in theone or the other, but in the whole. Not only western medicine, buteven Ayurveda and Homeopathy often fail to take this into account.The role of the Christian Confessional in healing was always restoringrelationships with others as also with the Transcendent. Its modernsecular substitute, Psychoanalysis/Psychotherapy does not alwaysgive due importance to restoring right relationships - with others orwith the Transcendent.58 Healing: A Holistic Approach Attitudes are fundamental for health and healing - attitudes towards oneself, towards Reality as such, towards one's own stress andsuffering, but also attitudes to others to their woes and joys, to theirills and sorrows to their welfare and fulfilment. Conclusion I am an Eastern Orthodox bishop. My people call me Hasyo deelan , which means \"Our Healer.\" True spiritual ministry is the healing of people - body and soul. In our tradition, salvation meanshealing, giving life where death rules. To save means to make alive.That includes deliverance from not only Hell, but also from the powerof death and of evil as well. But not just from a future Hell where theflame is never quenched and the worm dies not. Salvation meansalso delivering people, and that not just Christians, from present Hell,the hell of stress and anxiety, of guilt and fear of condemnation, ofpain and torment in all forms, from disease and sickness, from eviland fear of death. It is as part of that universal healing ministry that I am committed to the renewal of western medicine on a more genuinely wholisticand human basis, as well as to the revival and revitalisation oftraditional systems of healing, so that all systems of healing can be atthe service of all humanity, especially of the poor and the marginalised. In this preliminary consultation, we should look at the whole scenario of diverse healing systems without bias or dogma. We shallbe as unsparing in our critique of alternative systems, as of thedominant system. Our basic purpose is the revitalisation andreorientation of all healing systems, and their simultaneous andintegrated availability to people, first in a few \"Polytherapic HealingCentres\" on an experimental basis, and later, everywhere in the world.59 Healing: A Holistic Approach Mental Factors in Health Care 1. Though mental health, peace and joy are by-products of religious faith, it does not follow that religion is merely a means of attaining mental peace. The purpose of religion is to find one's grounding inGod, and to work out that faith-grounding through worship and work. 2. The most fundamental problems of human existence are anxiety about the future and a sense of guilt about the past and the present.The two are interconnected. The anxiety factor includes an elementof fear of punishment for the sins one committed. 3. The sense of guilt seems also the root of a great deal of hypocrisy, dissimulation, pretension and falsehood. Precisely becauseI have an anxiety that others may not accept me as I am, I try,unconsciously, to pretend that I am something else, something biggerand better than what I really am. This falseness in its turn creates theanxiety that someone may discover one's true \"self.\" Thus guilt,anxiety, and falseness reinforce each other in human existence. 4. The combination of guilt, anxiety and falseness, seems what lies under the heightened phenomenon of stress , (The classical discussion of Stress is in Hans Selve M.D., The Stress of Life , (1956), Revised edition, Mc-Graw Hill, 1976) or as it is technically called inmedical literature \"stress syndrome\" or \"General AdaptationSyndrome.\" Medically this relates to disease in which non-specificbodily or mental stress plays a decisive role. 5. The false distinction which medical science itself makes between \"bodily\" and \"mental\" in diagnosing the origin (aetiology) of diseases,belongs to the \"total stress\" of the civilisation which we have nowadopted from the west. Its science and knowledge itself have beenproduced by the stress of a guilt-and-anxiety-lader culture - guiltyabout its colonial past, actrocities, exploitations, wars, concentrationcamps and holocausts. Mind and body cannot be thus distinguished.The mind is part, integral part, of a living body, and what affects thebody affects the mind, and vice versa. We will not arrive at a healthysociety until we overcome this false mind-body dualism, and theregarding of the body as inferior, which is an aspect of Indian culture.60 Healing: A Holistic Approach 6. The Stress Syndrome or the General Adaptation Syndrome, as described by Dr. Selye, affects the whole body and mind. When theBody-Mind confronts a general stress situation, the kidney has towork extra hard to maintain stability of blood pressure; there arechanges in the walls of the arteries; it affects all connective tissuesand can lead to inflammation; it affects also the lymphatic cells andeosinophil cells; it causes the pituitary, thyroid and adrenal glandtissues, the liver, the adrenaline medulla, and the whole nervous system,to produce chemical changes. The high incidence of stress andmaladaptation of the body-mind system in coping with stress, accountspartially for increases in diseases like high blood pressure, diseasesof the heart and blood vessels, diseases of the kidney, eclampsia inpregnant women, rheumatic and rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatorydiseases of and eyes, allergic and hypersensitivity diseases,sexual derangements, digestive diseases, cancer, and of coursenervous and mental diseases. It increases general irritability in menand women and often wreck marriages. It can also create hyper-excitation as well as depression, both of which affect human relationsand lead to various bodily and nervous diseases. Impulsive behaviour,emotional instability, inability to concentrate, loss of the joy of life,insomnia, predilection to fatigue, and hypermobility (inability to sitstill, be silent, or relax), can all result from stress. And many patientswho consult a physician, only to be told that they have no disease,experience even more stress. They feel that they have to prove thatthey are sick. And this only adds to the general stress syndrome, andcould lead to increase in self-medication (pain killers and tranquillisers),increased smoking, loss of appetite, missed menstrual cycles in women,or increased pre-menstrual stress, migraine head-aches, and evenalcohol and drug addiction. It makes people more self-hating andaccident prone. 7. This brief and non-professional description of the General Adaptation Syndrome accounts for some 60% of the people comingto a hospital for treatment, sometimes with a localized and identifiablesymptom but more often without. It is no use telling them that theirdisease is \"psychological.\" It has affected their physical body as wellas their psychic equipment.61 Healing: A Holistic Approach 8. The modern doctor recognizes this as a case calling for administering some placebo or palliative, some pink tablet or red'mixture', and in some cases it works, because the very falling sickand going to hospital help to win the sympathy of the family and torelieve some of the stress. 9. It is at this point that the renewal of the patient's religious faith can very effectively be used as a better cure than the placebo orpalliative. It is therefore imperative that at least in all hospitals rununder private auspices, and desirably in other hospitals as well, thereshould be more than just a chaplain or psychiatrist. We need in eachmajor hospital a team of skilled, gifted and well-trained religiouscounsellors, who can help renew the patient's faith without anypressure to impose the categories of another religion on the patient.If it is a Hindu patient, there are enough resources in the Hindutradition itself for a substantial evocation of the patient's faith withinthe categories of the Hindu tradition itself-using the Fita, the Vedas,Upanishads and Hindu rites and forms of worship. The same for aMuslim or a Christian patient. A Christian hospital should not imposea Christian religious categories on a Hindu or a Muslim patient. Thisis difficult to accept for Christians who have been brain-washed inone or other particular form of Christianity which emphasizes the\"sacred duty\" of converting everyone to Christianity. 10. I would like to see a Christian hospital taking the initiative in this area, by employing a team of three to five religious counsellors,perhaps starting with two Hindu and two Christians and a Muslimwhen a suitable person is available. These persons should have someelementary knowledge of the body including the nervous and glandularsystems, of pathology, and of psychology, in addition to a good groundingin one's own religious tradition. The Mandiram Hospital and MandiramMental Health Centre should do some pioneer work at this point andset a pattern for the other hospitals. I would like to be involved in theearlier stages of pioneering if a decision can be made to proceed inthis direction and some funds set aside for the preliminary work. Weshould look around for a Hindu Chaplain, preferably a young sanyasiwith some training in counselling. If necessary appropriate personsshould be advertised for, recruited, sent for training in counselling at62 Healing: A Holistic Approach Vellore, and then given special training locally. 11. I shall conclude this paper by pointing to some of the beliefs and practices directly related to Christianity, but with parallels in otherreligions, which have direct relevance for mental and physical health.The \"beliefs and practices\" should not be understood as intellectualideas or activistic exercises. They belong to a corpus of life within areligions tradition, and therefore demand changes not only in individualminds, but in collective practice as well. Religion should not be reducedto therapy, though the therapeutic function of good religion can neverbe ignored. Perhaps we should also think about the pathogenic functionof bad religion, and make sure that these do not create new problemsin the hospital. The kind of religion which the Christian hospitalpromotes should be therapeutic, healing, wholesome, whether it isHindu, Muslim or Christian. Some Christian elements are highlightedin the following paragraphs, as a starting point for further discussion. 12. Freedom from anxiety is perhaps the most important single element which must ensue from any healthy religious tradition. In the Christian faith, freedom from anxiety is a consequence of a complete trust in God through Jesus Christ. \"Do not be anxious about your life,what you shall eat or what you shall drink\" (Mt. 6:25, Lk 12:22). \"Donot be anxious (Mt. 10:19, MK 13:11,LK tomorrow\" (Mt. 6:34). Thesenegative injunctions of our Lord have to be transformed into a positiveexperience for the patient, who has to be helped \"to cast all yourcare on Him, for He cares\" (1 Pet. 5:7). Like Martha we are allbasically \"anxious and troubled\" (LK 10:41), and the passage fromanxiety to trust is a great healing experience. It is the duty of a hospitalto provide opportunities for the patient to find this basic trust, whichwill remove half of the stress involved. There are similar sources in other religions. The Gita as a whole is set in the context of Arjuna's anxiety on the field of battle, and thestress situation. And the Gita solution is in the peroration of LordKrishna's words in the 18th chapter of the Gita. \"With the Lord in thy heart take refuge with all thy being; by His Grace thou shalt attain to the supreme peace and63 Healing: A Holistic Approach the eternal standing. .... Become Me-minded, devoted to Me, to Me do sacrifice and adoration. .... Put asideall laws of conduct. Seek refuge in me alone. I willrelease thee from all sin; do not be sad.\" I am sure that many similar texts can be found in all scriptures. Gita passage connects deliverance from anxiety with trust in God and at the same time the acceptance of forgiveness of all sinsas a gift of grace from God's hand. Along with anxiety guilt is themost powerful factor at the root of a great deal of general stress anddisease. The heart of the Christian faith is in God's grace and lovewhich forgives sins and accepts the sinner as son or daughter. Godgives forgiveness freely: but we find it difficult to accept thatforgiveness; the hardest thing for me is to forgive myself, and toaccept the grace of forgiveness. I fear that I will lose my independenceif I accept forgiveness, for to acknowledge forgiveness is to recognizea permanent obligation to the forgiver. I would much rather bepunished than forgiven; for if I am punished, then I have no furtherobligation to the one against whom I have sinned. Helping people toaccept forgiveness is one of the hardest tasks in patient counselling,and in healing people. The toughest struggle is against sin and guilt.Many Christians who glibly and knowingly talk about sin and guiltand forgiveness in a naive way, (of saying some words of confession64 Healing: A Holistic Approach and accepting some words of absolution) do not know either the power of guilt or the power of God's love which overcomes it. Here both Christian teaching and Hindu doctrine need deepening. Hindu thought finds the source of papa in the lower nature - in thetamo and rajo gunas . These are the desire aspects of the soul - kama operating through thought and action at the level of the desire - soul, yielding to passions of the ego, swayed by the unstable playsof the gunas in the mind and the will. The purpose of Yoga then is torise above the level of the desire-soul, to the higher atman, whichknows itself as divine. Sri Aurobindo defines the Hindu conception ofsin in the following words: \"Sin is the working of the lower nature for the crude satisfaction of its own ignorant, dull or violent rajasicand tamasic propensities in revolt against any high self-control and self-mastery of the nature by the spirit.\" (Essays on the Gita , Pondicherry, p. 267) Sri Aurobindo goes on to say that the way \"to get rid of this crude compulsion of the being by the lower prakrti in its inferior modes 'is by' recourse to the highest mode of that Prakrti , the Sattwik, which is seeking always for a harmonious light of knowledge and for a rightrule of action\" (ibid). This is also Christian ascetic teaching - that the higher aspects of the human spirit, controlled by the divine Spirit, should in turn controlthe lower aspects of feeling, will and mind, passion and desire anderror. But in order to get going in such a discipline of overcoming the lower elements in me, I need the starting push of grace as forgivenessand the sustaining grace for perseverance. Here both the Christianteaching and the Gita teaching are extremely helpful and the traditionis full of profound insights about overcoming sin and guilt should betaught to the healing team, so that they are able to mediate the deepestmysteries of the tradition to the true seekers. Our usual theology,both Christian and Hindu, are quite superficial. There is a lot of workto be done here in relation to the deeper elements of the Tradition.65 Healing: A Holistic Approach 14. The third element we spoke about at the beginning is falsity of being, connected with and reinforced by anxiety and guilt. We haveto be very brief here, precisely because even a cursory analysis offalsity in our being would take several pages. Healing comes fromremoval of falseness, not just in speech, but also in our verypretensions, illusions and attitudes. Here perhaps religion too oftenencourages falsity, in the form of hypocrisy, sanctimoniousness, andblind prejudices springing from utter selfishness. Only a deepexperience of being accepted by God as I am, can release me fromthe need to pretend. So long as my estimate of myself is based onother people's ideas about me, I will be false. To accept forgivenessat a deep level, removes the need for pretension and hypocrisy. Butthis is a life-long process, and the skilled healer has to be able toassist the patient at a deep level. 15. One of the manifestations of anxiety, guilt and falsity, can be an acute sense of boredom. People try to overcome this boredom byoverwork and drinking; but both are counter-productive, and theboredom becomes deeper and deeper at the subconscious level, andmakes people frighteningly unhappy. This is happening to manysuccessful businessmen, managers, and doctors among others. Muchof the sickness comes from that terrible combination of non-specificstress and boredom interacting with work-a-holism or alcoholism andthe extra stress on body and mind produced by either or both incombination. Here no other healing is possible except through a deep faith and a comprehensive compassion for all people, especially the sufferingand the victims of injustice. The human capacity for feeling, and thehuman will for doing, as well as the human mind thinking and knowinghas to be disciplined together for a life of compassionate understandingof identification with, and curative action to heal, the suffering in ownsociety. This includes socio-economic as well as political study andaction. As part of the healing process, the healing team will have tohelp the patient to find his or her way to make full use of one's mind,will and feeling for the good of others. That is the way to overcomeboredom and to find the way to joy.66 Healing: A Holistic Approach 16. The most important point to be taken into account by religious people concerned about healing cannot be treated here at any length.This has to do with the socio-economic structures which are at theroot of much disease. We need to be concerned not only with theindividual patient who comes to the hospital to be healer, but alsowith the social, economic and political structures which are the causeof such disease. One could also dwell at length on how corruptions inthe religious institutions are themselves responsible for much ill health. 17. There is not enough time to speak about the practice of meditation which now has been proved to have tremendous healingpowers. I am sure other religious leaders will speak at length aboutthese. I only want to point out that almost any form of meditation, ifit does not come out of anxiety and self-condemnation will have healingeffects. Practices like Transcendental Meditation have proved to becapable of bringing tranquility to restless spirits and minds. Yoga isthe combination of exercise and meditation. Stretching, twisting,reaching and bending are good for body and mind. In Christianity andIslam as well as in Hinduism this is achieved through nisar, Sashtangapranam and Yogasanas ) as part of daily hours of prayer. Modern research teaches that two hours of standing every day is good for body and mind.Traditional religious practices has incorporated these elements. But let me issue a warning here. No meditation technique can be developed into a complete religion. Meditation and Yoga are merelymethods, instruments, leading to the realisation of truth in wisdomand love. Meditation is for concentration, for deliverance from thedistraction of many ideas, many desires, many drives, in order toenable us to seek \"the one good thing\" which Mary chose, over againstMartha who was busy with \"many things\" (LK 10:41). Meditationhelps us to get out of our \"thinking\" which is the root of much ill-health. To stop thinking and start being still is a very curative technique.Good meditation decreases the restless alpha waves from the brainand increases the more quiet beta and these waves, and bettersynchronizes the waves from the two hemispheres of the brain. In spite of all that, meditation cannot solve all problems. If you are67 Healing: A Holistic Approach interested in a technical critique of the techniques of meditation, I would draw your attention to Chapter 7, entitled \"Caveat Meditator\"in Robert E. Ornstein, The Mind Field A Personal Essay , (Viking Press, New York, 1976. \"In the absence of anything more highly developed, such programms impress their followers, and yield greatbenefits to their leaders..... From one system, one can learn to relax; from a second, to relate; from a third, to respond.... (But) the primaryfunction of the diverse techniques of meditation is tobegin to answer the basic questions of life, such questionsas .... What is the purpose of existence?.... (which)cannot be answered in the same rational, verbal manneras can questions about the nature of the physical, oreven social environment, Meditation, then, is 'a-logical',intended to defeat the ordinary sequential and analyticapproach to problem-solving in situations where this approach is not appropriate\" (pp. 87-88). Meditation is curative, because it helps to move away from the discursive, analytical conceptual frame of mind within which muchof the anxiety functions. But religion itself cannot be reduced to anymeditation technique. And if one thinks that only meditation techniqueshave value in healing, one is selling good religion very much short.68 Healing: A Holistic Approach The Healing Ministry of the Church It was my privilege some years ago to dine at High Table in the Hall of Christ Church, Oxford. Sitting next to me was the RegiusProfessor of Medicine at Oxford. As conversation had to begin, Iasked him: \"What is the most significant and promising area ofresearch in medicine today at Oxford?\" The answer came withoutmuch hesitation: \"The relation between body and mind in the causeand cure of disease.\" The Platonic and Stoic traditions are deeply entrenched in Christian thought. For the Stoics, the body was a microcosm reflecting thecosmos. In Alexander Pope's words: \"All are but parts of one stupendous whole Whose body Nature is, and God the Soul.\" In the microcosm, the body, working according to a law which is written into it by the Logos or Reason, encloses the Soul. For thePlatonists, the body was parallel to matter, and the soul to form. Butbody and mind, even to a Christian thinker like Augustine, were twoseparate entities, the former inferior to the latter. Mind is immortal,whereas body is mortal, according to Augustine. The mind has \"anature of its own\" and is a \"substance.\" The soul is \"prior\" to thebody and non-spatial ( On the Immortality of the Soul , 17, 24). The tendency to think thus of mind and body as two distinct, though inseparable, entities seems deep-rooted in the human tradition. Onefinds basically the same thought in Buddhist documents coming froman earlier period. The Surangama Sutra (Sanskrit, ca. 1st CenturyA.D.) after a very involved and sophisticated discussion, separatesthe body from the mind, placing the latter in the category of eternalessences and regarding the body as something merely spatio-temporal. Both Western and Eastern cultures developed early a 'scientific' approach to medicine. In the beginning of our era, before the adventof Christianity, there were great physicians both in the East and theWest. Hippocrates and Galen in the West were paralleled in India byCharaka and Susruta and later Vagbhata. The Indian treatise69 Healing: A Holistic Approach Charakasamhita, coming from the early centuries of our era, deals in eight chapters with (i) major surgery, (ii) minor surgery, (iii) healingof internal diseases, (iv) casting out demons, (v) children's diseases,(vi) toxicology, (vii) elixirs, and (viii) aphrodisiacs. The Ashtanga-sangraha Vagbhata is now being taught in Ayurvedic Colleges ofMedicine in Mysore and elsewhere. China has a long and honourablehistory of medicine. Egypt developed a sophisticated medicine andsurgery millennia before Christ. Mesopotamian medicine was highlydeveloped in the time of Hammurabi. It is only on the basis of anunduly limited amount of information that one can say, as some modernwriters do, that surgery was the result of dedivinization of the humanbody brought about by the Gospel. In both scientific approaches, however, there was this tendency to take the body as a distinct organism with its own laws, not directlyrelated to the mind. The mind was open to deception and demon-possession but not to disease. Nor were mental factors seriouslytaken into account in medical aetiology and pathology. To put it bluntly, the temptation of the cultured or 'scientific' man is to regard disease as a biological fact alone, and therefore assomething to be dealt with biologically. But the bios, of which biology is the science, is gradually becoming recognized to include not onlythe body, but also the psyche (the soul). There is yet another separation which has been more characteristic of the West than of the East, namely that between thought and feeling.This has not always been so, even in the West. As Professor R. B.Onians points out in his Origins of European Thought , 1 in the Homeric literature, thought and feeling are themselves bodily actions,both intimately connected with the physical body. For a detailed history of Body and Mind in Western Thought , the reader is invited to consult the rewarding summary by Dr. JoanReeves in her Pelican book of that title (1958). In the Eastern Patristic tradition, however, one finds an approach which is more directly incarnational, and while heavily influenced bythe Greek classical tradition, yet shows a more comprehensive andfruitful line. Here is Gregory of Nyssa in On the making of man :70 Healing: A Holistic Approach \"The purpose of our argument was to show that the mind is not restricted to any part of the Body, but is equally in touch with thewhole, producing its motion according to the nature of the part whichis under its influence. There are cases, however, in which the mindeven follows the bodily impulses, and becomes, as it were, theirservant; for often the bodily nature takes the lead by introducingeither the sense of that which gives pain or the desire for that whichgives pleasure, so that it may be said to furnish the first beginnings...\" \"Neither is there perception without material substance, nor does the act of perception take place without the intellectual faculty...\" \"The mind is not confined to any one part of us, but is equally in all and through all, neither surrounding anything without, nor beingenclosed within anything: for these phrases are properly applied tocasks or other bodies that are placed one inside the other; but theunion of the mental with the bodily presents a connection unspeakableand inconceivable - not being within it (for the incorporeal is not enclosed in a body), nor yet surrounding it without (for that which is incorporeal cannot enclose something within it), but the mind approaching our nature in some inexplicable and incomprehensibleway, and coming into contact with it, is to be regarded as both in itand around it, neither implanted in it nor enfolded with it, but in a waywhich we cannot speak or think, except so far as this, that while thenature ( phusis ) prospers according to its own order, the mind is also operative; but if any misfortune befalls the former, the movement ofthe mind halts correspondingly.\" 2 Here two things are clearly noted, which seem to be not clearly recognized by Augustine, who was trained in the same classicaltradition (though in its Latin version). First, while Augustine also recognizes the inseparability of the body and soul, he is more inclined to regard the body as in some sensecontaining the soul, the soul being the captain of the ship of the body.The re-interpretation of the relation between body and mind is animportant clue to the restoration of Christian healing in our tie, asmuch as to an authentic doctrine of Christian worship and obedience.71 Healing: A Holistic Approach Second, and perhaps more important, Gregory recognises the essential mystery of the body-mind relationship, a problem to whichmany solutions have been offered in the centuries following, withoutfinding wide acceptance. It is important for the Church's healingministry to have a grasp of this central mystery of human existence,which comes up as a perennial problem in the history of Westernthought. Modern Western medicine is very young, a product of the Enlightenment, optimistic about its own capacity to understand, temptedto regard every mystery as ultimately reducible to a problem or apuzzle to be solved by the human mind, and mechanistic in its basicunderstanding of reality. Bacteriology is hardly a hundred years old, and it is the key to modern medicine. Most of our knowledge of physico-chemical causesof diseases come from this century. University level medical trainingis a phenomenon that began to develop only after 1910 in the NorthAmerican continent. The Church must develop a more balanced and not over enthusiastic attitude towards the dominance of this young science inour understanding of human disease. Disease and healing cannot beunderstood apart from their physical causes, but to understand themin a purely physical sense is to misunderstand them dangerously. The recognition of this integral relation between soma and psyche is the necessary preliminary step towards a proper perspective onthe healing ministry of the Church. Otherwise we are in danger ofthinking of medical missions as in some sense secondary to the propertask of evangelism. Healing of disease is neither a praeparatio evangelica , nor a work of charity which follows the preaching of the Gospel. Such a view has at least the following eight consequences:a) Medical missions cannot be construed as a means to draw people to the Church, so that they can later be addressed with theGospel. b) The healing ministry is no longer an optional element in the72 Healing: A Holistic Approach total ministry of the Church. Salvation means healing of the totality of man. c) The healing ministry of the Church is not adequately exercised when the Church runs hospitals which use the highly fruitful, thoughonly partially adequate, techniques of modern medical science. d) 'Faith healing', which has received scant attention and often contemptuous rejection at the hands of modern theology and modernmedicine, should come in for a fresh appraisal. Healing services,prayers for the sick and anointing of the sick should receive freshstudy. e) If healing of the lame, the blind, the paralytic and the mentally ill had the function of a \"sign of the Kingdom\" in the New Testament,we need to rediscover the ways in which this can be the case in ourtime. f) Certain special areas of medical mission which cater both to mental and physical health should receive priority in the work of theChurch: e.g. psychiatric and medical social work, expert pastoralcounselling engaged in by clergy and laity, mental and physical hygienein rural and urban communities, diseases caused or intensified byanxiety, guilt, fear, loneliness, hatred and other 'mental' causes, etc. g) Stimulus to medical research itself, by providing opportunities for qualified Christian and non-Christian medical practitioners toconsider together the mental and social causes of illness, and to carrythrough social legislation and the establishment of programmesconducive to the prevention and cure of ill-health in society. h) The organization of Medical Associations and nurses' associations, for constantly keeping the medical profession in dialoguewith social, psychological and theological thinking, and for helpingdoctors and nurses as well as all Christians to be aware of theircommon responsibility for the health and well-being of society. * * * * * \"If you will diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord your God, and do that which is right in his eyes, and give heed to his73 Healing: A Holistic Approach commandments and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases upon you which I put upon the Egyptians; for I am the Lord, yourhealer\" (Exodus 15:26). The connection between sin and sickness needs more careful study. This is not to be treated in an individual framework, though the relationbetween the individual's sickness and his sin should not be ignored.Obedience to the Lord God, or a dynamic righteousness in society, isthe inescapable pre-condition for the health of man in society. \"When I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or command the locust to devour the land, or send pestilence among my people, ifmy people who are called by my name humble themselves, and prayand seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hearfrom heaven and will forgive their sin, and heal their land\" (II Chron.7:14) said Yahweh to Solomon at the dedication of the Temple. Repentance, and the consequent experience of God's forgiving grace, in a corporate as well as an individual context, form parts ofthe healing ministry of the Church. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits,Who forgives all your iniquity,Who heals all your diseases. (Ps. 103:2-3) Repent, O ye sons of wavering, I shall heal you from your wavering (Jer. 3:22). The leaves of the \"tree of life\" are for \"the healing of the nations\" (Rev. 22:22). This close relation between repentance and healing has practical implications in our time. Corporate and personal repentance has tobe provided for in the life and worship of the Church. The 'sacrament'of confession needs to be reinstated in a meaningful form in all thechurches. The penitential prayers in our corporate worship have tobe made more realistic and relevant. Deep-seated sin and guilt in oursubliminal consciousness has to be brought up and dealt with. Nationsthemselves have to be made strong enough to confess their nationalsins, both internally and in relation to the other nations.74 Healing: A Holistic Approach The Eucharist, the \"medicine of immortality\", should become a true healing agent in the life of the congregations. This applies equallyto Orthodox and non-Orthodox churches. The Church should seek also to eliminate social and personal injustice in society, in order that the healing of the nations may becomea reality. The congregation should promote mutual reconciliation andacceptance within itself, so that it may become a genuinely healingand forgiving community, not an association of morbid pietists or ofescapist activists. As for the institutional aspect of the medical ministry, a Christian hospital should be characterized (not necessarily through having amajority of baptized Christians on its staff) by: a) An atmosphere of warm affection, joy and personal concern.b) Pastoral care for the total well-being of the patients, but not through using the depressed situation of the patient as an opportunityfor evangelism-medical social workers may have a role to play evenin the hospital. c) Special care for the poor.d) High level of technical efficiency, equipment and competence.e) A central core community of Christian professionals, on the staff, dedicated to making it an authentically Christian institution, witha discipline of corporate worship, discussion and leadership. f) Close but informal connection with qualified and specially chosen and trained people in the congregations in the area (on an ecumenicalpattern) who take an active interest in all the patients in the hospital,visit them and care for them. 1. Cambridge, 1951, p. 3ff.2. LNPF, Series Two, Vol. V, p. 402ff.75 Healing: A Holistic Approach Reshaping Health Care The International Consultation on Medical Anthropology and Alternative Systems of Healing brought together some 50 healersand thinkers from various countries including USA, Germany, Japan,New Zealand, Russia, India, Oman and Tibet, for a consultation atthe Hotel Raj Hans, Surajkund, Haryana (near New Delhi), India,from February 20th to 27th, 1995. The Consultation had four majorobjectives: a. to make a preliminary assessment of the views of reality and perceptions of what constitutes a human person as implied orexpressed in various healing systems developed by different culturesof the world. This, rather than any particular academic discipline iswhat was meant by the term \"medical anthropology\"; b. a cursory examination of the development of modern western medicine, and of the reasons why more and more people are turningaway from the western medical system of Allopathy and resorting totraditional healing systems or to Homeopathy for their health careneeds; c. an assessment of the state of Traditional Healing Systems and Homeopathy; and exploring ways and means to make the immensewealth of these rich traditions more easily and effectively accessibleto people; d. to suggest changes in existing patterns of health care and to make other suggestions and recommendations to governments, privatesector enterprises related to healing, to the healing profession, tovoluntary organisations and to the general public. We had the benefit of a rich input in the form of presentations, demonstrations and discussions. The free consultation clinics inAyurveda, Unani, Homeopathy, the Japanese system of Jorei,Naturopathy, Yoga, Tibetan Medicine, Russian Traditional medicine,Pranic Healing, High Genki, Acupressure and Massage techniqueswere utilised by participants as well as by hundreds of visitors fromDelhi and Haryana. Participants thus had an opportunity to observe76 Healing: A Holistic Approach the actual practise of Traditional Systems of Healing and Homeopathy, in addition to hearing some highly informative presentations on thevarious systems of Healing. They also saw how widespread was thepublic interested in these Traditional Healing Systems andHomeopathy. We were graciously received by the great Sikh Guru and Healer, Baba Virsa Singhji Maharaj, and the we spent in his presence atthe Gobind Sadan, Mehrauli, New Delhi, was itself a healingexperience for most of us. Among many other precious insights whichhe gave us in that hour, Babaji also told us: \"If we see clearly, we can see that humans are the most poisonous of all creatures. ... When we hate or whenanger and bitterness burns within us, we emit poisoninto the world and pollute it. ... When our thoughts arepoisoning us, how can medicine help? When we purifyour thoughts, when loving compassionate servicemotivates us, when we meditate deeply, not only our own bodies and spirits, but also the whole world will be cleansed, and people will be more healthy... If angerand hatred leave us, we can save millions on armamentsas well.\" In his erudite inaugural address, the Government of India's Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, Dr. C. Silvera said, \"As a system Allopathy has its own plus points. But it has certain obvious pitfalls as well. The cost factor, non-availability to a vast majority of the people, hospital-induced illness, over-use of chemicals in pharmacopeiaand prescriptions, indiscriminate use of antibiotics, theover-technologisation of both diagnosis and therapy, andconsequent impersonalization of healing are some ofthese.\" The Minister announced that \"very soon a separate Department for Indian Systems of Medicine and Homeopathy will be createdunder the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.\" This newDepartment will seek among other things:77 Healing: A Holistic Approach (a) the upgrading of colleges for training personnel for Indian Systems of Medicine. (b) the setting up of four drug testing laboratories for Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy. (c) research revitalisation in these systems. (d) exposing practitioners of these systems to the National Health Programme through three-week courses, and (e) the setting up of at least one Specialised Hospital in each state, for the practice of these systems, on the lines of Allopathic hospitals. The Minister continued to stress the drawbacks in the present situation, including the inadequate level of training administered incolleges for these systems, their insufficiently developed theoreticalframework, practice by healers of substandard training, tonics andpatent medicines not conforming to standard or even to the labels.He said: \"However, there is no gainsaying the fact that we need to enforce stricter standards than is presently the case.Let me assure you that this is an issue to which myMinistry will address itself with all seriousness.\" We were served a rich feast of knowledge and wisdom in the form of papers and presentations, including the Presidential addressof the Co-Chairperson, Prof. R.

In factworld view of most of these systems was deeply rooted in spiritual/religious perceptions of the universe and its transcendent origins; thehuman person was always an integral aspect of that cosmos, not asubject standing outside the world, trying to view it as an object. The universal Aboriginal or Adivasi Culture in all continents, (Tribal, African, Native American, Siberian, Chinese or Indian) was one wherehumans felt close to earth and sky, to air and water to trees andanimals - participating fully with them in the cosmic community. Weof the urban-technological civilization would appear to have lost mostof that sense of intimacy and community. In fact it is still there in ourblood and in our genes, dormant, inactive, but not yet extinct; it needsonly to be reawakened and rekindled. Appreciation and practice of Traditional Systems of Healing and Homeopathy will be easier in a culture which regains some of that Primal Vision of our ancestors,irrespective of where on the globe we live today. When we come to the world's great religions, which have been the matrix of most of the traditional healing systems, we are struckby the fact that most of the world's religions, and therefore thetraditional healing systems integral to them, are of Asian origin: EastAsian, South Asian or West Asian: Taoism, of East and Sikhism of South Asian origin; and Zoroastrianism,Judaism, Christianity and Islam from West Asia, with a largecontribution from Egypt in Africa and Greece in Europe. All traditional healing systems, including the western traditional or Greek, operate within one more of these religions, sharing their worldview, quite often transcending the limits of any one religion. Ayurvedain India for example predates the division of the Indian heritage intoJain, Buddhist and Hindu; it takes eclectically from many philosophicalsystems - Sankhya, Nyaya-Vaiseshika, Jaina, Buddhist, according toneed, but the relation to the Cosmos or the Transcendent is never79 Healing: A Holistic Approach obscured. Even the western or Greek system was never totally secular: Pythagoreanism - Platonism, the Orphic-Apollonian-Dionysiancults and other Mystery Religions were in the background ofHippocrates and Galen, Asclepiades and Alcibiades (most of theGreeks were from Asia Minor), Herophilus and Erasistratus. TheUnani system is a typical case of Jewish-Greek-Christian-Muslim,confluence. When we come to modern western medicine, there is a fundamental change in this outlook. There is a crisis in our healthcare system centered in Allopathy. This crisis is, in fact, a crisis ofculture. Allopathy is a product of a particular culture and bears itsmarks. The Evolution of Western culture and Western Medicine Some understanding of the transition of Europe from the Medieval Christian (Roman Catholic) culture to the Modern Secular culture isnecessary if we want to come to terms with what looks like anapparent conflict between Modern Western medicine on the one handand Traditional Healing Systems and Homeopathy on the other. Medieval Christendom (ca 800 to ca 1750) was, at least on the surface, a homogeneous religious culture, with the authority of theChurch (after the Protestant Reformation of 1517 ff, of the Churchand the Bible, but still of some form of western Christianity) rulingsupreme at least in theory. Enormous socio-economic and anti-clericalconflicts simmered under the calm-looking surface of a society whichhad suddenly become affluent, through trade, piracy, colonialism andimperialism. The old structures of a feudal society were alreadycoming apart at the seams, with the advance of the IndustrialRevolution and the rise of the bourgeoisie as the newly dominantclass replacing the feudal barons and nobles. It was in this context that in 18th century Europe and later in America, a process called \"Secularisation\" spread, overthrowing thecontrol of the Church over property, ideas and institutions, includingmedical and educational institutions run by monks and priests - the13th century medical schools in Salerno and Montpelier, Paris and80 Healing: A Holistic Approach Bologna, Padua and Leiden. Great theological-spiritual masters like the monk Roger Bacon and the Abbot Albertus Magnus (teacher ofThomas Aquinas) were also great physicians. Other great healerswere attached to Popes and Kings. Secularisation took medicine awayfrom the Church and the monks, and established the foundations of amedical system without conscious grounding in any religious worldview. The decisive event of this process was what we call the European Enlightenment, one of whose great symbols was the French Revolutionin 1789 with its slogan of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity, directedagainst the church's domination, inequality and paternalism. TheEuropean Enlightenment of the 18th and 19th centuries boldly assertedthe freedom and autonomy of the individual, against the unfreedomand theonomy or hateronomy of religion and tradition. In pre-18thecentury European Christendom, religious notions like the Kingdom ofGod provided the basic framework for unifying all experience. Thisreligious authority and tradition is what Secularisation and theEnlightenment totally and completely repudiated as an affront to thefreedom and autonomy of the human person. The unifying principle of all experience was no longer to be supplied by religion or tradition; human reason was its own authority overwhich the Enlightenment would acknowledge no higher authority.Human rationality was capable of grasping reality and transformingit to serve humanity's interests. It was in this milieu that modernscience and technology were born; modern western medicine, basedon science and technology, was also born in this matrix of repudiatingall authority outside of human rationality, rejecting practically all agencyexcept human agency. Science, the major instrument of humanrationality, and technology as tool for human control of the world,together became now the unifying principle of experience. What wasnot knowable by the methods of science was not knowledge in thisview. Everything that needs to be done can somehow be accomplishedby technological know-how. Man is the Supreme Healer, knowingand handling the human body like other objects, through modernscience and the technology based on it.81 Healing: A Holistic Approach This meant also the marginalisation of art, philosophy and religion as knowledge-gathering and communicating symbol systems. Thenew Positivist Philosophy, articulated by Auguste Comte, affirmedthat all European knowledge, and therefore by exptrapolation allhuman knowledge, has passed through three progressive stages ofdevelopment: the theological-religious, the philosophical-metaphysical,and finally the scientific-positive. Only the last was true adultknowledge because it was not dependent on any external authority;the theological/religious belonged to the infancy of humanity; thephilosophical/metaphysical belonged to humanity's adolescence. Theadult, in order to affirm his/her own freedom and authority, mustabandon what belonged to the child and the adolescent. For western science, till recently, Traditional Systems of Healing belonged to that childhood or adolescence of humanity, and are to beassigned to the outer margins of civilised society, where people withoutmodern education and scientific thinking, and therefore without thebenefit of the European Enlightenment and its rationality, live-in non-western cultures, in the lower uneducated classes of western society,and so on. If anything in the Traditional Systems of Healing is to beaccepted by adult, free human beings, they had to be tested on theanvil of scientific rationality and experimental validation. We should acknowledge the fact that modern western medicine, even when based on the Cartesian-Mechanistic-Reductionist model,has enormous successes to its credit. It has liberated humanity, atleast in some measure, from its fear of unknown and unknowableexternal or internal forces like superstition, fatalism, karma, anddemonic agencies. It has overcome epidemics and contributed tolonger life expectancy. Many diseases, previously thought incurable,have been brought under partial control. Allopathy acknowledges, at least in theory, its origins in Hippocratic thought and practice. It has, however come to neglect some of themain themes of Hippocratic medicine: e.g. health as a state of balance,the importance of environmental influences, body-mindinterdependence, nature's inherent healing power. Instead it chosethe Cartesian model, which is dualistic, reductionist and mechanistic.82 Healing: A Holistic Approach It separated body and mind, assigning the body to physicians and surgeons, and the mind to psychiatrists and psychoanalysts. It sawthe body on the analogy of a machine composed of different parts,and attributed disease to organ dysfunctions or invasions by bacteriawhich had to be exterminated. Diagnosis and therapy were based onsimplistic single cause explanation, leading to treatment of that singlecause. This single cause-effect understanding was reinforced bydevelopments in laboratory medicine and medical technology. Thecost of treatment arose enormously as medical technology advanced.There was failure to recognize fully the inter-dependence of body-mind-environment, and to understand the human person as subsistingonly in relation to various other subsystems which affected illnessand wellness. The system was tardy in recognising and nurturing the inherent healing powers in nature and in the human body. Excessive use ofantibiotics led to unexpected consequences, like reduced resistanceto disease, enfeeblement of the immune system and the rise of strainsof new bacteria resistant to all known antibiotics and hence as lethalas AIDS. The pace of increasing sophistication and complexity indiagnostic technology not only raises health care costs to exorbitantlyhigh levels, but also progressively marginalises the physician-patientinteraction, so essential to health and healing. The proliferation ofoften unnecessary chemical drugs, combined with the overuse ofchemical fertilizers, pesticides, food preservatives and detergents,increases toxicity in the human body and lowers the general healthlevel of people. We note that in certain countries, some pharmaceuticalcompanies, insurance companies and some medical professionalstogether constitute a highly exploitative and unjust \"health business.\"These are factors that urgently call for remedy and rectification inwestern medicine. At the same time there have been many positive developments in the theory and practice of modern western medicine. The growth ofepidemiology as a discipline and public health as a service have led toa better recognition of the multifactorial and interactive approach toillness and health, taking social, environmental and even culturalfactors into account. The emphasis on preventive medicine, on83 Healing: A Holistic Approach community health delivery, and the \"health for the millions\" approach have helped broaden out the perceptions of western medicine intonutritional practices and environmental factors. The new emphasison \"life-style related diseases\" helped the understanding of heartdiseases, cancer, diabetes, mental illness and other stress relateddisorders. The role of diet, exercise and relaxation techniques is nowbetter recognised. Socio-economic deprivation as a major contributorto ill-health, links health care today with the wider aspects of thepolitical economy. The recent emergence of evolutionary epidemiologydraws attention to the factor of cultural change and the consequenterosion of the protective practices of the old cultures as a majorcause of ill-health and epidemics. Technology itself has helped in the unravelling of the complex interplay of myriad interdependent systems in the body and in theworld, from cell to cosmos, which keep a person healthy.Psychosomatic medicine and Psychoneuro immunology emerging asnew inter-disciplinary systems of knowledge and the emergence ofbio-feedback technology, have revealed how the mind and will affectthe body through neurohumoral influences and by mental states. There is a growing recognition of the role of faith and spirituality in health and healing. The power of prayer to heal is now welldocumented. All these combine to initiate some radical changes in modern western medicine, bringing it closer to the reality perceptions of theTraditional Systems of Healing. There is a new paradigm emerging-one that integrates the physical, mental, environmental, social, andspiritual domains. Its articulation is progressing very slowly; theconception itself is still in evolution. Medical Anthropology, or ourunderstanding of how the human person functions in relation to therest of the universe, calls for clearer formulation, incorporating therole, not only of science, but also of art, philosophy and religion, inhealth and healing. As this paradigm shift grows to maturity, we can expect a creative regeneration in modern western medicine. This process willnot takeplace independently of a better understanding of and co-operation84 Healing: A Holistic Approach with Traditional Systems of Healing; it will also facilitate that necessary understanding and co-operation in the interests of the health and well-being of the whole of humanity. The Present and Future of Traditional Systems of Healing It is by no means easy to produce an exhaustive list of the Traditional Systems of Healing. We want first to suggest that weabandon the use of the term \"Alternative Systems of Healing\". Itseems to imply that one system, namely Allopathy, is normative andthe others are simply alternatives. When we speak of \"Traditional Systems of Healing\" we mean the traditions of healing and health care of all cultures - of China andJapan, of India and Tibet, of the Arab World, of Europe and theAmericas, of all of Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Weshould include Homeopathy, though it is rather modern in origin. Wealso include a plethora of newly emerging healing systems - e.g.;Pranic Healing, Jorei, High Genki, Reflexology, Magnetology,Cheiropractic, Osteopathy, Cranio-Sacral Therapy and so on, all ofwhich seem to have some roots in Ancient Traditions. We note the growing recognition of TSH (Traditional Systems of Healing) by Allopathy, and the selective and partial incorporation ofsome of its techniques into Allopathic medicine as an adjunct to it.This is not what matters, however, from the perspective of the people'shealth needs. We are convinced that the resuscitation and promotionof Traditional Systems in their own right is absolutely necessary forthe welfare of humanity; we affirm that we cannot begin to meet thehealth needs of the whole of humanity without the aid of TSH. The TSH have a claim for preferential treatment, becausea. they are community based and have already a strong manpower base, which includes trained healers as well as local or tribalhealth practitioners; b. they rely primarily on local resources like flora, fauna and minerals; c. they are cost effective and within reach of ordinary people;85 Healing: A Holistic Approach d. the possibility for commercialisation and exploitation is much less in these systems compared to western medicine; thoughhigh vigilance is required to ensure that as the people'sawareness of and demand for these systems go up, commercialestablishment will certainly exploit them for profit; e. their side effects are much less, and properly controlled, they do less damage to humanity's health and well-being; f. they are well integrated with culture specific life styles, while generally being holistic in their approach to health care. It is a fact however that TSH have been surviving for the past two hundred years on the margins of public life. The EuropeanEnlightenment and its secular civilizations banished them from theofficial public arena, along with all tradition and all religion. Allopathywhich conformed to the standards of western science took over thecentre of the public health care system. No marginalised community can live and flourish normally; this is true for women, for Adivasis and Aboriginals, for Blacks and NativeAmericans; it is true also for religion which has not done well in thepast two hundred years as compared to earlier periods. TraditionalHealing Systems were cast out, along with the religions which weretheir matrix. Prolonged marginalisation distorts everything; TSH are no exception. The state gives primary attention to the Allopathic system,casting an occasional crumb from its sumptuous tables to thehousehold pets of TSH. Their potential is not recognised or sufficientlyutilised in primary health care or in hospitals and systems of trainingmedical and paramedical personnel. With the waning of Staterecognition and support, some people lose confidence in their ownhealing traditions. Allopathic physicians and nurses, by virtue of theirtraining school education, tend to look down on the practitioners ofTSH. On the other hand there is a groundswell of new demand forthese Traditional Systems on the part of people everywhere. Theirrespect for these systems is growing. What should we do to bring these TSH back to life and help them86 Healing: A Holistic Approach fulfil their true function? First, we need to do certain things both for TSH and also for Allopathy: a. confirm and reaffirm what is good and should in these systems; b. remove what is distorted in systems and restore them to their original authenticity; c. complete what remains incomplete in the light of experience and new knowledge, especially by learning from one another. A major problem in relation to TSH was that of standards for training practitioners and their licensing or accreditation. Thetraditional method in these systems is apprenticeship or guru-sishya- parampara , or handing over the knowledge from teacher to disciple, in a system where theory and practice are never separated. Thissystem is difficult to practise on a large scale, when there is need forthousands of practitioners to bring health care to people. Training in TSH therefore can be best achieved in small scale participatory teacher-student patterns in the setting of local cultures.However, large scale colleges for Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Unani,Siddha, Naturopathy, Yoga therapy, Chinese Medicine and othersystems are already in existence. These institutions now seek toimitate the pattern of Allopathic medical schools; sometimes eventhe subjects and text books of Allopathy are utilised. The end result ismajor distortions in the authenticity of the TSH. One thing we notice is that each system remains in isolation. The practitioner of one system knows very little about other systems.This defect should be remedied at the training stage itself, by shortcourses for exposure to other systems, preferably in the latter's clinicsand institutions. The curriculum of Allopathic medical schools shoulddefinitely include such exposure to TSH. But the same has to bedone in the training programme of each Traditional System as well. Multisystem Healing Centres We saw the need for culturally adapted multi-system healing centres in all countries and all regions of each country. Some of theexisting clinics and hospitals could incorporate more systems into87 Healing: A Holistic Approach their present structure. The multi-system centres could be designed in such a way that there is creative interaction between the varioussystems. A multi-system diagnostic team could screen each personcoming for healing and assign a suitable programme of treatment inone or more systems, according to need and preference. It is desirablethat large buildings are avoided, regimentation reduced to a minimumand convivial living conditions provided for all, preferably in opencountry, in sylvan settings where possible, plenty of gardens and openspaces provided, with flowing streams and winding lanes and clubsand cafes for creative interaction among patients and healers. Costshave to be kept as low as possible, so that ordinary people can benefitfrom them. State and private sector subsidies should be sought andutilised; especially to help the poor. These centres can also play a central role in gathering information and establishing a data base about the efficacy, safety and cost ofthe various systems. They could besides serve as internship hospitalsfor trainees in various systems. In some cases these centres can alsoundertake or promote research in the various systems. They canalso serve as referral centres for patients from other centres. Suchcentres can co-operate with other similar centres, so that each canlearn from the other. One question which seemed central is the extent to which the standards of modern science should be applied to the testing ofTraditional Systems. What Constitutes Valid Evidence for Efficacy and Safety of any System? It is clear that all healing systems should be tested for their efficacy and safety. This applies to the Allopathic system as well. We weretold of the Weinberg study, according to which only 20% of the cureseffected in allopathy can be attributed to the treatment applied, 30%is placebo effect, 25% due to some form of catharsis, and theremaining 25% due to what is called the X-Factor, which may includefaith and prayer. Whatever be the validity of this report, it is clearthat strict laboratory evidence cannot be obtained for all these factorsinvolved in healing. In the case of all systems, whether Allopathy or88 Healing: A Holistic Approach Traditional, the following principle can guide our thinking about efficacy and safety. 1. All systems should be evaluated and assessed, in ways appropriate to each system, for their efficacy and safety, beforethey can be licensed or used in the public health care system. 2. The causal connection between the treatment and its beneficial outcome may not always be traceable accurately. This maybe due to limits in our theoretical understanding or in ourinvestigational tools. Our inability to trace the causal chainshould not however lead to rejection of healing methods ofproven efficacy. 3. Any evaluation process should give more importance to patient- relevant outcomes like survival, well-being, functional state,and self-care possibilities than to physician-relevant outcomeslike clinical or laboratory indicators. Pre-treatment and post-well being measurements of measurable aspects should alsobe gathered and studied wherever possible. 4. Documentation should include cases of success in treatment as well as of failure and fatalities. 5. Comparative clinical trials may in some cases be used to test the efficacy of various systems. 6. Comparative cost-effectiveness assessments should also be used in testing usability of various systems. 7. Careful documentation about experiences of groups of persons could also be studied to supplement the assessment of varioussystems. 8. The internal criteria of one system cannot be applied in the assessment of other systems. Recommendations We address our modest suggestions and recommendations to governments, intergovernmental bodies, to voluntary agencies andinternational non-governmental agencies, to Corporations and89 Healing: A Holistic Approach Insurance companies, to professional healers, to the general public to the communications media. To National Governments 1. Many governments recognize only a few selected Traditional Systems of Healing for support and promotion; we recommend thatthey should seek to be as inclusive as possible, and not to neglect thescores of systems now coming back to life, including traditionalChinese, Japanese, Tibetan, Native American and Indian systems, aswell as the newly emerging systems like Craniosacral Therapy,Macrobiotics, Reflexology, Magnetology and so on. Governmentsdirectly or through other public bodies should evaluate and assess byappropriate methods the efficacy and safety of all systems, and takeinto consideration their easy availability to people as well as costfactors. 2. In setting up or supporting high quality training centres for the various systems, special attention should be given to the culture-specific ambiance of each system. Most traditional systems do betterin small scale settings and rural conditions. Since their futureparticipation in nation-wide health programmes is in view, the urbansetting is often uncongenial. 3. Governments should promote or establish testing facilities and centres appropriate to each system for the continuing monitoring ofquality and standards of pharmaceuticals and other medical productsin traditional systems. No product should be sold in the market withoutcertification of quality. 4. Governments should set up or promote high quality multisystem healing centres, where there is co-ordination and continuousinteraction among the various systems. These new institutions shouldbe centres of comparative study, of multi-system treatment, evaluation,standard-setting for accreditation, documentation and research, forTraditional Systems of Healing, Homeopathy and Emerging NewSystems. 5. Governments should fund and promote research in Traditional Systems of Healing, using also the multi-system centres and testing90 Healing: A Holistic Approach facilities. Research in TSH, when attached to Allopathy dominated institutions should not remain at the margins of the programme ofsuch institutes, but should promote continuous interaction among TSHand Allopathy. 6. Governments should legislate for proper monitoring of TSH products and for the licensing and registration of TSH practitioners.Norms of training and qualification should be established and strictlyimplemented, suitably disciplining violators and malpractitioners.Governments should also pass and enforce appropriate legislation toregulate the large scale export of the herbal resources of the country. To the World Health Organisation and Other UN Agencies 1. WHO should initiate effective programmes for the comparative study and assessment of the world-wide use of Traditional Systemsof Healing, Homeopathy and Emerging New Therapies, which areall already playing a major role in the health care of the people. 2. WHO should support the setting up of a World Association of Traditional Healers, on the patterns of the existing CIOMS whichbrings together national health associations. To this end the WHOshould encourage member governments who have not already doneso, to set up national associations of traditional healers in each country. 3. Other UN agencies like UNICEF, UNDP etc should take into account the role of Traditional Systems of Healing in supportingdevelopment programmes and projects, and especially in caring forthe health of infants and mothers. 4. WHO should take initiatives to promote creative interaction between Allopathy and Traditional Healing Systems, as well as topromote the recognition and use of TSH in all countries in order tofulfil its own commitment to \"Health for the Millions by the Year2000\" (Alma Ata Declaration, 1978). To the General Public, and Especially to Voluntary Agencies and Non government Organisations 1. High Priority should be given to awareness building among the general public, first about the basic factors contributing to human91 Healing: A Holistic Approach health and well-being (Health Awareness Programmes), and secondly about the existence, efficacy and availability at low cost of TraditionalSystems of Healing. 2. Every effort should be made for maximising the use of TSH in primary health care and in urban and rural health delivery systems. 3. Support should be given for the starting of multi-system healing centres in urban and rural areas. 4. A meeting of all voluntary organisations and NGOs working in the field of health should be convoked to consider ways and meansof promoting TSH. 5. Take initiatives for setting up international and national non- governmental bodies to promote TSH, and for the networking ofpractitioners. 6. There is urgent need for a manual of Traditional Systems of Healing, homeopathy and Emerging New Systems, with briefintroductions to some 20 of the most important systems (about 20-25pages for each discipline) among these, choosing those with provenefficacy, easy availability and low cost. The essays must becompetently written by experts in each field, with a view to beingused as a text book in all institutions of medical training, allopathic,traditional or new. Perhaps a two volume edition, affordable, shouldbe made available also to the general public. To Corporations, Insurance Companies and others 1. We recognised the fact that economic power to effect some of these measures was not primarily in the hands of governmental bodies.We saw the positive role that private sector corporations could playin promoting universal health care, making maximum use ofTraditional Systems of Healing, Homeopathy, and the NewlyEmerging Systems of Healing. Their economic power andorganizational resources should be optimally used to promote TSH.This is particularly so, in the context of increasing privatisation ofmedicine and healing and the entry of corporations into large scalemanufacturing and marketing of pharmaceuticals for TSH.92 Healing: A Holistic Approach 2. We felt the need for the corporations, in consultation with public interest bodies and persons, formulating a code of conduct to beobserved by all private sector enterprises in the field of health andhealing. Such a code should give priority to the interests of the publicand only secondarily to the conventional private sector interest ofprofit and power. The corporations should pledge themselves not toengage in the manufacture or marketing of any product or serviceharmful to the health and well being of the people, or beyond themeans of ordinary people. 3. The corporations should jointly or individually set up endowments, funds and foundations for promoting Traditional Systemsof Healing, Homeopathy and Emerging New Therapies and formaximising their use in the health care of the common people. Thiswould be in the interest of Health Insurance companies in all lands asthe use of TSH will substantially reduce morbidity and mortality. Theyshould set aside and wisely use funds for setting up multisystemcentres of healing research and documentation. 4. The corporations should take special care to see that the natural herbal resources of countries are not depleted or destroyed by over-exploitation. They should make it a point to ensure that for everyherbal plant plucked up two are immediately planted, as is done inafforestation programmes. To the Media - Print, Electronic and Other 1. Health for all is just as important as Food and Clothing for All, or as part of the movement for a Sustainable Life Environment, andfor Peace, Justice, Freedom and Dignity for All. A workableprogramme for ensuring Health for All must necessarily include therenewal and full utilisation of Traditional Systems of Healing,Homeopathy and the Newly Emerging Therapies. We appeal to allmedia to intensify their efforts to promote public awareness of thesesystems and to disseminate accurate information about them. Wemake a special appeal to local languages media to highlight thesesystems and their capacity to prevent illness and promote health. 2. We appeal especially to teachers, doctors, literary writers, actors,93 Healing: A Holistic Approach poets, painters, musicians, dancers and other artists to help in the dissemination of knowledge about the basic principle of health, andto fulfil the potential role of all media in creating greater awarenessabout the possibilities and advantages of TSH. 3. We welcome projects to start global media channels and networks which specialize, on a non-profit, non-commercial basis, inpromoting information on Transcultural Health Care, projectingparticularly some of the essential sub-cultural aspects of TSH, anddrawing special attention also to the spiritual aspects of health andhealing. 4. The Media should promote debate and discussion to bring about better mutual understanding between western medicine and TSH,and to dispel prevailing ignorance and wrong notions. 5. As multi-system healing centres develop all over the world, the media should promote awareness about these centres as a significantmove in advance towards Health for All. "}
