Examples include calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, zinc, and iodine. Dietitians may recommend that dietary minerals are best supplied by ingesting specific foods rich with the element(s) of interest. The minerals may be naturally present in the food (e.g., calcium in dairy milk) or added to the food (e.g., orange juice fortified with calcium, salt fortified with iodine, iodized salt).
