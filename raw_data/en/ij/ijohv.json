Little information is available relating to the cause, frequency or severity of local reactions (redness, swelling, pain) that occur in the majority of OPT recipients. This study determined that the method of injecting the OPT vaccine intramuscu\u00ad larly decreased the frequency of local reactions. Sixty\u00ad eight children receiving their third OPT immunization were enrolled in this single-blind, controlled study. The results indicated that local reactions were signifi\u00ad cantly reduced (\u00a3 ~ .10) when the OPT vaccine was ad\u00ad ministered by the Z-track method of intramuscular injec\u00ad tion with an air bolus following the vaccine using a dry, sterile In needle, as compared with other standard intra\u00ad muscular techniques. .viii ACKNOWLEDGMENTS . . . . ix Chapter I.

CHAPTER I INTRODUCTION The frequent and widespread use of DPT vaccine in the United States should prompt frequent evaluation of complications associated with its administration. How\u00ad ever, research over the past 40 years has provided incon\u00ad clusive information regarding the causes, frequency and severity of systemic and local reactions in OPT immuniza\u00ad tions. Experimental vaccines were developed in the 1930s and were used widely in clinical practice by the mid- 1940s. However, federal standards were not developed until 1947 and current potency requirements were not developed until 1953. During this period, investigations focused on severe complications with the OPT vaccine, but little information was obtained on the frequency of systemic and local reactions. As the routine administration of OPT vaccine in\u00ad creased in the 1960s and 70s, the emphasis of research evolved to the risk/benefit analysis of use. The contro\u00ad versy concerning complications from the OPT vaccination versus experiencing the disease itself spread from the 2 medical to the public arena. Public acceptance of rou\u00ad tine vaccination dropped from a 75% level in 1974 to 30% in 1978 in Great Britain (Mortimer, 1980). The resultant increase of pertussis in England and Wales in the late 1970s provided necessary data supporting the importance and benefits of routine immunization. The goals of present research are to maintain disease control, provide continued immunity and decrease systemic and local reactions. Several factors have been associated with adverse reactions to DPT immunizations. They are related to the type of vaccine given, how it is given, where it is given and how often it is given. purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether or not intramuscular injection methods affected the frequen\u00ad cy of local reactions when compared to a control group not employing these methods. Significance of the Research By reviewing the available literature on local DPT reactions and by evaluating nursing principles and techniques of intramuscular (1M) injections, it was pos\u00ad tulated that a method of 1M injection could be developed to minimize the exposure of subcutaneous tissue to DPT vaccine. This method would have the potential to reduce the 50-75% incidence of local reactions in DPT recipients 3 (Baraff & Cherry, 1978; as well as pro\u00ad vide a standard procedure for administering the DPT vac\u00ad cine. The information provided in this study may be used in future investigations as a framework for evaluating local DPT reactions. Standardization of definitions, measurements, procedures and controls were not consistent or present in previous research, but have been further developed in this study. CHAPTER II REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE studies providing the most information on DPT vac\u00ad cine's effectiveness and reactions were done within the first decade after the vaccine was introduced in 1933 (diSant'Agnese, 1949; Toomey, 1949). Only within the past 10 years have researchers begun to evaluate variables associated with the vaccine and its administration that may produce systemic and local reac\u00ad tions (Baraff & & Manclark, 1981; Mortimer, 1980). In Sauer's (1933) early vaccine trials, descriptions of systemic and local reactions were reported (redness, swelling, local pain and mild elevations in temperature within the first few days after immunization), but stan\u00ad dardized criteria had not been established to determine the degree or severity of the reactions to report ac\u00ad curate rates. Subsequently, other researchers have re\u00ad ported varying data concerning frequency and severity of 5 reactions (Kendrick & Eldering, 1939; Sako et aI, 1945: Sako, 1947). The studies also differ in the dosages and types of vaccines used and in their method of data col\u00ad lection. These studies suggest a low frequency of minor and major reactions. Sako et ale (1945) used graduated dosages of 0.2 cc, 0.3 cc and 0.5 cc of pertussis vaccine in the primary vaccinations series and found that local reactions oc\u00ad curred more frequently with the larger two dosages. In 1947, Sako compared the types of pertussis vaccines (fluid, combined DPT, alum-precipitated) being utilized clinically for local and systemic reaction rates as well as duration and stability of antibody titer. From these results, pertussis vaccine became federally standardized and current potency requirements were developed. Studies prior to this period became obsolete, providing esti\u00ad mates, at best. Most research concerning DPT vaccine in recent years has been focused on the risks of systemic reactions ver\u00ad sus benefits of routine administration (Hannick, Mortimer & Jones, 1978; stewart, 1977, 1978, 1979; stuart-Harris, 1978). These retrospective studies estimated the rate of severe reactions (i.e., convulsions) to occur in 1:1,750 to 1:800,000 vaccines. At present, there are no estimates 6 available on vaccine licensed in the U.S. Again, lack of standardization in vaccines, in definitions, in measuring denominators and lack of controls limit the validity of these results. Recent studies suggest several causal factors for complications from DPT vaccination. It is generally agreed that the pertussis component of the DPT vaccine is primarily responsible for adverse reactions (Baraff et al., 1984~ Baraff & Cherry, 1978~ Cody et al., 1981~ Mortimer, 1980). Baraff and Cherry (1978) and Hopkins (1978) speculate that reactions may be a toxic response to components of the vaccine or may be due to biological\u00ad ly active substances within the bacteria itself (Borde\u00ad tella pertussis). In recent reports (Baraff et al., 1984~ Baraff & Cherry, 1978~ Cody et al., 1981), systemic reactions (drowsiness, fretfulness, vomiting, anorexia, crying, temperature) were found to be less frequent with increasing series number of DPT. Local reactions (red\u00ad ness, swelling, pain) were most frequent with increasing series number. The site of injection was not associated with lower systemic reaction rates, but the anterior mid\u00ad thigh and upper lateral thigh had significantly higher local reaction rates than the buttocks (Baraff et al., 1984) Studies evaluating differences in vaccines from different manufacturers concluded that the differences in reaction rates were related more to differences in the processing of particular vaccine lots by a manufacturer than to a specific manufacturer (Baraff et al., 1984; Hopkins, 1978). 7 Three studies have addressed the incidence of local reactions with OPT vaccination. In 1979, Barkin and Pichichero reported in their prospective study that 72% of their clients demonstrated a local reaction (pain, redness, swelling). They also agreed that local reac\u00ad tions increase with each subsequent exposure to the vac\u00ad cine, and that systemic reactions decrease. Cody et ale (1981) reported the following data on percentage of oc\u00ad currence of local reactions by series number (Table 1). The increase in reported pain of the fourth and fifth OPT vaccination can be attributed to the older child's abili\u00ad ty to express pain. These data suggest a problem of some magnitude in that 50-75% of OPT recipients experience lo\u00ad cal reactions within 24 to 48 hours after immunization. In 1945, Sako mentioned that the \"intracutaneous in\u00ad troduction of the vaccine during innoculation sets up an acute inflammation of the skin which soon involves the subcutaneous tissues and leads to complications\" (p. 383). He recommended a method in which the amount of vaccine on the immunizing needle would be absent or mini\u00ad mal; this can be accomplished by leaving one needle in the vaccine bottle, transferring the material into the 8 Table 1 Percentage of Occurrence of Less Serious Reactions Following DPT Immunization Analyzed by Series Number Series Number Reaction 1 2 3 4 5 Q value n 4,964 3,764 3,957 2,166 876 - Swelling 38.0 37.6 41.5 48.9 46.0 .0001 Pain 47.6 44.7 46.6 68.1 74.4 < .0001 Note. from S.M. & Manclark, C.R.

Pediatrics, 68, 650. --9 syringe, detaching the syringe and replacing with a separate, dry, sterile needle. Sako (1947) did not clarify whether \"intracutaneous\" included the epidermal, dermal and/or subcutaneous layers. Recommendations for proper administration of vaccine at that time included deep subcutaneous or intramuscular injections. However, according to Sako's hypothesis, giving subcutaneous in\u00ad jections would increase the frequency of local reactions, but his results showed only an 8.6% incidence of local reactions. His recommendation of using a dry, sterile needle for the injection has not been supported through studies, but Baraff et al. (1984) support Sako's observa\u00ad tion and further suggest that air should not be extruded from single-dose, preloaded syringes. Wong (1982), Hays (1974), and Dison (1975) recommend that a bolus of air (0.2-0.5 cc) in the syringe at the time of injection clears the needle of all medication and prevents leakage of the vaccine along the needle track. The Z-track method described by Dison (1975), Hays (1974) and Fulginiti (1982) ensures that the vaccine is deposited deep in the muscle tissue and that it will not leak into the cutaneous layers causing irritation. Re\u00ad ported data on the Z-track method and its effectiveness relates to the administration of the iron dextran complex (Imferon). There have been no studies to date that sug\u00ad gest whether the Z-track method might decrease local 10 reactions in DPT vaccinations. Current Communicable Disease Center (CDC) (Utah State Department of Health, 1983) and American Academy of Pediatrics (1982) recommendations of DPT administration advise intramuscular injections, but no reference is made to methods or techniques that would decrease the intro\u00ad duction of vaccine to the subcutaneous layers. In this study, methods were used to minimize the deposition of OPT vaccine in the dermal layers, and were analyzed to determine their effect on local reactions with a control group not employing these methods. CHAPTER III CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK The goal of this research was to decrease local in\u00ad flammatory reactions (redness, swelling, pain) in OPT im\u00ad munizations utilizing methods of intramuscular injec\u00ad tion (Z-track, air bolus, dry, sterile 1\" needle) that would minimize exposure of vaccine to subcutaneous tis\u00ad sue. Other variables that are related to the inflamma\u00ad tory response are shown in Figure 1. The vaccine may cause a toxic response in the indi\u00ad vidual that may present with systemic and/or local reac\u00ad tions. There may also be biologically active components within the OPT vaccine that may cause similar reactions. Additionally, variance in processing the vaccine by dif\u00ad ferent manufacturers or between different lots from the same manufacturer may cause adverse reactions. It is reported that the anterolateral aspect of the thigh has a higher incidence of local reactions than the gluteal or deltoid muscle; the site of injection was not significant in the incidence of systemic reactions. Studies are in process to evaluate rationale for these occurrences. It is suggested that there are fewer Method of Injection Site of Injection Inflammatory Reactions (redness, pain swelling) DPT Vaccine Number of Exposures Figure 1. Factors influencing local inflammatory reactions in DPT immunizations. 12 13 local reactions in the gluteal and deltoid muscle due to the proper deep intramuscular placement of vaccine. Reported local reactions usually increase with increased exposure to the DPT vaccine; systemic reactions usually decrease. A relationship between higher blood titer levels of DPT and susceptibility to the previous factors have been suggested. It is recommended that the DPT vaccine be given deep intramuscularly, but the methods of achieving this goal have not been detailed. It has been suggested that when the vaccine is in contact with subcutaneous tissue, an inflammatory response may occur, as indicated by redness, swelling and/or pain. If local reactions are present, it is assumed that deep intramuscular placement of DPT vac\u00ad cine has not been achieved. Current studies have not substantiated this. The inflammatory response is a normal physiological reaction to foreign substances in contact with sensitive areas of the body. The dermal layers may be sensitized to components in the vaccine and/or may develop a sensi\u00ad tivity due to frequent exposures of the vaccine. The inadvertant leakage, seepage or placement of DPT vaccine in the dermal layer may also cause an inflammatory response in sensitized tissues. All of these factors may interface in the occurrence of local reactions in DPT im\u00ad munizations. 14 Some assumptions were made in relation to this study. The first was that the individual that received the vaccine had no underlying medical condition that would interfere with the normal physiological response to the DPT vaccine. The second assumption inferred that all commercially available DPT vaccine met federal guidelines for safe administration and contained no harmful sub\u00ad stances. The last assumed that the inflammatory process is a normal physiological response in a healthy person subject to irritating or foreign substances. From this framework, means for controlling factors influencing local reactions have been developed to elimi\u00ad nate extraneous variables that would have influenced the study's results. was: Research Question The research question employed in this investigation Does the use of the Z-track method of intramuscular injection with a dry, sterile 1\" needle and 0.2 cc bolus of air following the vaccine reduce the fre\u00ad quency of local reactions in the third DPT immuniza\u00ad tion? Operational Definitions Local Inflammatory Reaction Local inflammatory reaction is defined as a physio-15 logical response to foreign substances exhibited by red\u00ad ness, swelling and/or pain within 24 hours after injec\u00ad tion. DPT Immunization DPT immunization is a DPT vaccine that is given at regularly scheduled intervals (established by AAP and CDC recommendations) to provide immunological responses to diptheria, pertussis and tetanus. Vaccine Vaccine is defined as commercially available u.s. licensed diphtheria and tetanus toxoids with alum\u00ad adsorbed pertussis vaccine. Methods of Intramuscular Injection Methods of intramuscular injection are the utiliza\u00ad tion of the Z-track, air bolus and dry, sterile 1\" needle in administering vaccine intramuscularly. The Z-track method is the maneuver of pulling the dermal and subcutaneous layers to one side prior to in\u00ad tramuscular injection resulting in a deep intramuscular injection and a broken injection path when the skin ten\u00ad sion is released. After the vaccine has been drawn up into the syringe from the vial, 0.2 cc air bolus is also drawn up. The air should be next to the plunger so that the air will 16 clear the medication out of the needle and clear the in\u00ad jected medication away from the needle track. Dry, sterile 1ft needle is a 25 gauge 1\" needle used for injection only. A separate needle is used to draw up the vaccine and is replaced by the injection needle. Third Primary Immunization The third DPT injection in the primary series of im\u00ad munizations to infants less than 12 months of age is de\u00ad fined as the third primary immunization. CHAPTER IV METHOD AND DESIGN A convenience sample of infants eligible for their third DPT injection was recruited for the study. The third OPT injection was chosen due to the possibility that it would induce greater local reactions than had the previous two immunizations, and also because oral polio vaccine (OPV) is not routinely given with the third OPT, thus decreasing extraneous variables. Parents were able to observe reactions more reliably because they had points of reference from the previous two immunizations. The criteria established for participation in the study included: 1. Less than 12 months of age; 2. The infant must have had two DPT and OPV vaccinations, but not within the previous 4-6 weeks; 3. Absence of fever (>38 degrees C) within the previous 24 hours; 4. No previous severe adverse reactions to DPT (AAP (1977) include high fever (>39 degrees e), somno\u00ad lence, screaming, shock or convulsions); 5. Parents spoke English; 18 6. Parents had a phone. It is suggested that no relationship exists between local reactions to DPT and gender, race or socioeconomic status (Sako et al., 1945). The Salt Lake City-County Health Department (SLCCHD) recruited subjects from three of their clinic sites (Cop\u00ad perview, Murray and Salt Lake) during the study period (February 1984). The subjects were assigned to the study group if they attended the clinics on Monday, Wednesday or Friday. They were assigned to the control group if they received the immunization on Tuesday or Thursday. This made the process easier for the nurse administering the vaccine to remember which method to use. One nurse at the SLCCHD and the researcher gave the vaccinations, which decreased the variability that would have existed with more administrators. The public health nurse (PHN) was given a copy of the protocol and instructed in the method. The method of administration was then demon\u00ad strated by the researcher, after which the PHN return\u00ad demonstrated the method prior to data collection. On nonstudy days, the PHN used her usual method of intramuscular injection (not changing needle, using 5/8\" needle, and either pinching or spreading skin taut over injection site depending on size of thigh) on control subjects. A single blind study was achieved by not informing 19 parents whether their child was in the study or control group. Both groups were instructed to read and sign the consent form (Appendix C). The nurse went over the immu\u00ad nization questionnaire (Appendix B) with each parent prior to the immunization explaining how to measure reac\u00ad tions and when to check the reactions. The nurse also went over common reactions and relief measures according to the agency's procedure. The equipment for the study included syringes, needles and DPT vaccine. The syringes provided by the SLCCHD were 3 cc with 25 gauge 5/8\" detachable needle. Sterile 25 gauge 1-needles used in the study group re\u00ad placed the 5/8\" needle on the syringe after the vaccine was drawn up. One inch 25 gauge needles are not routine\u00ad ly used in most medical institutions, so the researcher had to order them for the study. The vaccine used in all subjects was from the same manufacturer (Wyeth) and the same lot number (73701). The Wyeth vaccine contained the standard 4 protective units of pertussis, 5 Lf units tetanus and 12.0 Lf units diphtheria per dose. All subjects received the vaccination in the antero\u00ad lateral aspect of the left thigh. There is a higher in\u00ad cidence of local reactions in the thigh as compared to the buttocks, but there is a greater risk of nerve damage with any injection in the buttocks. Standard procedure at the SLCCHD is to rotate sites with each subsequent in-20 jection of OPT, beginning with the first OPT in the left leg, so the third OPT is also in the left leg. Criterion Measures and Instruments The immunization and telephone questionnaire (Appen\u00ad dices B and D) that was utilized was adapted from studies by Baraff, Cherry and Cody (1978) and Cody et al. (1981). These questionnaires had been piloted and tested in more than 16,000 subjects. The adapted questionnaire included information regarding local reactions, parents' concerns about other symptoms, use of pain/fever medication and physician contact. Questions regarding general or syste\u00ad mic reactions (except temperature) were excluded. Tem\u00ad perature was included to establish if a relationship existed between local reactions and onset of fever. Information regarding subject's name, birthdate, sex, immunization site, vaccine manufacturer and lot num\u00ad ber and series number were obtained by the administering nurse. The nurse also designated whether the subject was in the study or control group by marking both immuniza\u00ad tion and telephone questionnaires. The time intervals of 3, 6, and 24 hours after immu\u00ad nization were established to support the common belief that most reactions to OPT occur 4-6 hours after immuni\u00ad zation with most symptoms gone by 24 hours after immuni\u00ad zation. By measuring the type and degree of reaction at 21 these time periods, data needed to support this hypothe\u00ad sis were provided. It also recorded information con\u00ad cerning not only the onset of symptoms, but also the duration. The scale at the bottom of the questionnaire provided a standardized measure to assess the degree of redness or swelling. The scale was subject to the parents' interpretation and variability, but it provided a common meas.ure to establish severity. Severity of pain was difficult to assess; therefore, presence or absence of pain was recorded. Parents were shown how to use the scale to determine size of redness and swelling, and they were told what kind of behaviors their infant might exhi\u00ad bit in relation to pain (cry, pull leg away, sudden jerking motion of the leg), and how to record them on the questionnaire. When the parents observed other behaviors or symptoms that were not usual for their infant, they were encouraged to record the behavior and when it occurred. However, since these observations were not controlled for and did not relate to local reactions, they were not in\u00ad cluded in the results. Common remedies for the relief of symptoms related to DPT vaccinations are the use of acetaminophen, as\u00ad pirin, heat and cold packs. The questionnaire allowed parents to record what type of medication/treatment they used, when they first administered it, and how often they 22 repeated the practice. The telephone questionnaire provided a format for researchers to obtain information with little variability in reporting. Since the researcher was the only person obtaining follow-up information, the recording of infor\u00ad mation was consistent. Statistics The chi-square test (II) was utilized to compare the two groups. It differs from the chi-square (I) test in that there is no prior basis for computing expected frequencies; the expected frequencies are derived from the data. The probability level was set at the .10 level for a one-tailed test. A one-tailed test is used since the \u00a3 values are unidirectional on the curve. The contingency coefficient measured the extent of the relationship between the sets of variables. The upper limit for a strong relationship was .707. CHAPTER V RESULTS A total of 68 subjects participated in the study; 37 in the study group and 31 in the control group. Forty\u00ad nine percent of the study group and 52% of the control group were males. More than half of children in both groups received their DPT vaccination at the age-appro\u00ad priate recommendations of the CDC and AAP (Table 2). It was significant that 38% of subjects in the study group had no reactions and 16% of subjects in the control group reported no reactions (Tables, 3, 4 and Figure 2). Redness occurred three times more frequently in the con\u00ad trol group than the study group. Swelling occurred twice as often in the control group as in the study group. Pain and fever were reported 20% less frequently in the study group than the control group, but it was not statistically significant. There was a significant decrease in number of reactions, amount of redness and swelling in the study group, but strong relationships between variables (corre\u00ad lational coefficients) were not evident (Table 3). Redness was reported in 10% of the study group and in 42% of controls; more than 75% of those reacted within 24 Table 2 Age Distribution of Subjects at Third DPT Immunization subject's Study (n=37) Control (n=31) Age n % n - % - 6-7 months 24 65% 17 55% 8-9 months 19% 10-11 months 7 19% 8 26% 25 Table 3 Local and Systemic Reactions to Third OPT Immunizations Study (n=37) Control (n=31) Reactions n % n % E. value - - No Reactions 14 38 5 16 < .10 Redness 4 11 13 42 < .01 Swelling 10 27 16 52 < .10 pain 22 59 25 81 NS Fever 17 46 21 68 NS Note.

The size of the redness reaction did not vary significantly in the study or control groups (Table 5). Swelling occurred in 27% of the study group and in 52% of the control group. Over 80% of those infants whose parents reported swelling in both groups were observed to develop it within the 6 hour period after immunization (Figure 4). In the control group, 44% of those who experienced swelling reported it at 3, 6, and 24 hours as compared to 9% in the study group. No significant findings were found related to the size of the indurated area between the study and control groups (Table 6). Pain was reported in 59% of the study subjects and 81% of the control subjects. Half of those with pain in the study group reported it at the 3 hour interval as compared to 64% in the control group. Those who reported pain in the study and control groups (within 6 hours after immunization) numbered 92% and 80% respectively (Figure 5).

From these observations, 68% of the control group and 41% of the study group experienced fever in the 24 hour period after immunization. Less than 20% in both groups showed signs of fever by 3 hours after immunization. The study and control groups had the same number of subjects (32%) reporting presence of one local symptom (Table 7). However, 29% of the control group reported redness, swelling and pain as compared to 3% in the study group. More than 2/3 of the subjects in the study and 3/4 of the subjects in the control group used medica\u00ad tion/treatment during the 24 hour period after immuniza\u00ad tion (Table 8). Of those who received medication, aceta\u00ad minophen was chosen 88% of the time in the study group and 96% of the time in the control group (Table 9). Over half of the control group received medication within 4 hours after immunization, whereas, over half of the study group received their first dose of medication 4-8 hours after immunization (Table 10). Over 3/4 of the subjects received more than one dose of medication during the 24 hour period (Table 11). There were no reports of prolonged reactions, abscess formations or other unpredicted local reactions. This lack of reports may be attributable to the 24 hour limit on follow-up. 35 Table 7 Frequency Distribution of Number of Subjects With Reactions Associated with DPT study (n-37) Control (n=3l) Number of Symptoms n % n % - - 0 14 38 5 16 1 12 32 10 32 2 10 27 7 23 3 1 3 9 29 36 Table 8 Use of Medication/Treatment Within 24 Hours After DPT Immunization study (n=37) Control (n=31) n - % n - % Use of Medication/ Rx within 24 hours 25 68 24 77 Nonuse of medication 12 32 7 23 37 Table 9 Types of Medication/Treatment Used Within 24 Hours After DPT Immunization Type of Study (n=37) Control (n=3l) Treatment n % n % - - Acetaminophen 22 88 23 96 Aspirin 3 12 1 4 Antipyretic-/Heat Analgesic 3 12 1 4 Antipyretic-/Cold Analgesic 1 4 0 38 Table 10 Time of First Administration of Medication After DPT Immunization Hours After Study (n=25) Control (n=24) Immunization n % n % - - < o Hours 1 4 0 o -< 4 Hours 6 24 14 58 4 -< 8 Hours 13 52 7 29 8 -< 12 Hours 0 3 13 12 -24 Hours 5 20 0 39 Table 11 Number of Administrations of Medication within 24 Hour Period After DPT Immunization Number of Doses in 24 Hrs. study (n=25) n % Control (n=24) n - % 1 11 44 10 42 2 - 3 10 40 8 33 4 - 6 4 16 6 25 CHAPTER VI DISCUSSION OF FINDINGS Most studies over the past 40 years regarding DPT reactions have been retrospective, lack standard defini\u00ad tions and are not well-controlled, so that the results are estimates at best. The majority of this information is on vaccine that is not produced in the United States. Within the past decade, researchers have begun to provide structure in evaluating the DPT vaccine and reactions to it. In light of these recent advances, little is men\u00ad tioned about local reactions that occur in the majority of DPT recipients, or methods/interventions that might decrease the reaction rate. In comparing three recent studies that address local reactions with this study's control group, the findings were consistent except in the area of pain (Table 12). This gives more validity to the results of this study since similar results were obtained in previous research. There was a much higher occurrence of pain in the control group than had been previously reported, while the study group was more consistent with the previous findings. This may be due to variances among parental reporting or Table 12 Comparison of Frequency (%) of Local Reactions and Fever with Previous Studies Reactions Baraff Cherry Barkin & Pichichero Cody et al. (1978) (1979) (1981) 3rd OPT 3rd OPT Study Study Control Redness 57% 40.6% 40.4% number individuals with local reactions 72% 64% among researchers in their definitions of pain. Variables that contribute to the inflammatory pro\u00ad cess from the OPT vaccine have been identified, but the importance of each variable and its relationship to others in causing local reactions have not been estab\u00ad lished. This study determined that the method of ad\u00ad ministering OPT vaccine was effective in reducing the frequency of redness, swelling and pain, but the reac\u00ad tions were present in 60-80% of the study and control subjects, respectively. From this observation, it is ap\u00ad parent that the other variables (vaccine component, site of injection and number of exposures to OPT) need to be further analyzed to determine the extent of their in\u00ad volvement in local reactions. The study method of intramuscular injection had the greatest significance in reducing redness (~ = .01) and swelling (~~ .10) by ensuring that the OPT vaccine did not contact the subcutaneous tissue through its admini\u00ad stration. The results in the area of pain were not sig\u00ad nificant, which may be attributed to inflammation from the vaccine and not the way in which it was given. Redness and swelling occurred more frequently from 3 to 6 hours postimmunization, which corresponds to the normal physiologic inflammatory process. pain was mani\u00ad fest in the majority of subjects at 3 hours postimmuniza\u00ad tion. Rarely was fever reported prior to 3 hours postim-43 munization. From these observations, the likely sequence of events after the DPT immunization would be pain at the injection site with subsequent swelling and/or redness followed by fever. Further studies are needed to support this hypothesis. The majority of the study and control subjects re\u00ad ceived an analgesic/antipyretic during the 24-hour period after immunization. The effects of this medication on the inflammatory response are not known, but the effects on pain and fever are well-known and accepted. From the results of this study, medication may be given 3 to 6 hours after immunization for pain and fever control. Again, more data are needed to support this conclusion. Other local complications from the DPT vaccine were not reported. The incidence of abcess formation or pro\u00ad longed local reactions is not available from previous studies. Since these reactions take longer to develop this would be a recommendation for further study. It is possible they could have occurred beyond the 24-hour period included in this study. Summary A review of the literature provided inconclusive da\u00ad ta regarding the cause, frequency or severity of local reactions that occur in the majority of DPT recipients. Recent studies have identified variables that relate to local inflammatory reactions from the DPT vaccine, which include the OPT vaccine itself, the number of exposures to the vaccine, the site of injection and the method of injection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether or not intramuscular injection methods affected the frequency of local reactions when compared with a control group not employing these methods. 44 Sixty-eight children were recruited through the Salt Lake City and County Health Department to participate in this single-blind, controlled study. Subjects who re\u00ad ceived their immunization on Monday, Wednesday or Friday were assigned to the study group, while subjects who re\u00ad ceived their OPT on Tuesday or Thursday were assigned to the control group. The study group was given the OPT vaccine by the study method, which employed the Z-track method of intramuscular injection followed by an air bolus with a dry, sterile 1\" needle. The DPT vaccine was given to the control group by the standard intramuscular technique (not changing needle, using 5/8\" needle and either pinching or spreading skin taut over the injection site depending on size of thigh). Extraneous variables were controlled for by using the same manufacturer and lot number of DPT vaccine, by giving the third in the primary series of DPT vaccinations, and by utilizing the left anterolateral aspect of the thigh for the injection site. Parents were instructed to evaluate the type and degree of local reactions at 3, 6 and 24 hours postimmu-45 nization, and record their observations on the immuniza\u00ad tion questionnaire. The researcher recorded the parents' data on the telephone questionnaire 24 to 48 hours post\u00ad immunization. The results indicated that the study group had significantly more subjects reporting no local reactions to the DPT vaccine than the control group (\u00a3 i .109). It was also significant that the study group reported red\u00ad ness and swelling less frequently than the control group (\u00a3 = .01, \u00a3 i .10, respectively). Pain was reported by the vast majority of study and control groups, but the results were not statistically significant. The onset of redness, swelling and pain were reported 6 hours postim\u00ad munization for the majority of subjects who experienced these symptoms. Limitations This study was limited in its findings due to the small number of subjects. With a larger sample, more sophisticated statistical tests could be used to analyze the data in order to give greater significance to the results. Recommendations for Further study The following suggestions may be considered for replicating this study: 1. Parents should receive clearer instructions 46 about how to measure redness, swelling and pain with more objective criteria. This may include providing paper tape measures to parents, and observing their use on sample models so that less variability among observers exists. 2. Parents should be provided with rectal thermometers and given instructions on how to take and read temperatures. This would decrease the variability of fever scanners, axillary and rectal temperatures that was reported in this study. 3. Subjects should be followed prospectively through the entire primary series, and preferably through the fourth and fifth DPT. Comparisons could be made for the frequency and severity of reactions, and when certain reactions are most likely to occur. 4. Testing each technique of the study method (Z\u00ad track, dry, sterile 1\" needle, air bolus) independently to see if each is as effective alone or in combination with each other in reducing reactions is recommended. 5. Parents need to observe for local reactions for a 48-hour period after the injection so that the more severe local reactions (abcess formation or prolonged reactions) can be reported. other areas that may be investigated from this study include: 1. The duration of local reactions and the variables that may influence them. 2. The role of medications and treatments in reducing local and systemic reactions to OPT immuniza\u00ad tions. 3. The applicability of using the study method of intramuscular injection to other medications/substances that cause local reactions. Implications for Nursing 47 The results of this study may contribute new infor\u00ad mation in the areas of nursing practice, research and education. The study method of administering OPT immuni\u00ad zations is a combination of three nursing techniques de\u00ad veloped to ensure deep intramuscular injection (Z-track, air bolus, and dry, sterile 1\" needle). Its effective\u00ad ness in reducing local reactions from OPT vaccinations was significant in a small study. Further research and evaluation of the study method is needed before recommen\u00ad dations can be made for standardizing the proper proce\u00ad dure for OPT administration. By understanding the variables and processes that contribute to local inflammatory reactions in OPT immuni\u00ad zations, the nurse can use this information to develop, evaluate and assimilate other methods that may alter the frequency of reactions. She can also use this informa\u00ad tion to educate and counsel parents, peers and other health professionals about what type of reactions may present, when they may present, how long they may last and to recommend appropriate relief measures. 48 Until more conclusive information on decreasing OPT reactions is available, current practices of OPT admini\u00ad stration will continue with subsequent adverse reactions in the majority of individuals who receive it. However, this study may change the practice of how the DPT vaccine is administered by providing an alternative that is safe and effective in reducing the number of local inflamma\u00ad tory reactions in intramuscular injections. By providing proper instruction in administering the Z-tracK method of intramuscular injection with an air bolus following the vaccine using a dry, sterile 1\" needle, local redness and swelling from OPT immunizations can be significantly re\u00ad duced.

APPENDIX E RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMMUNIZATION 61 General Recommendations on Immunization The u.s. Public Health Service Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) has updated the 1980 statement of \"General Recommendations on Immunization.\" Highlights from the guidelines are reported below. Single copies of the entire statement are available on request. Route, Site, and Technique of Immunization- A. Route: There is a recommended route of administration for each immunobiologic. To avoid unnecessary local or systemic effects and/or ensure optimal efficacy, the practitioner should not deviate from the recommended route of administration. B. Site: Injectable immunobiologics should be administered in an area where there is minimal opportunity for local, neural, vascular, or tissue injury. Subcutaneous injections are usually administered into the thigh of infants and in the deltoid area of older chidren and adults. Intradermal injections are generally given on the volar surface of the forearms, except for human diploid cell rabies vaccine, with which reactions are less severe in the deltoid area. In the past, the upper, outer quadrant of the but\u00ad tocks was the usual site of intramuscular vaccination. The buttocks should not be routinely used as a vaccina\u00ad tion site for infants and children; and, to avoid injury to the sciatic nerves, they are generally not used in adults. The central region of the buttocks should be avoided for all injections; the upper, outer quadrant should be used only for the largest volumes of injection or when multiple doses need to be given, such as when large doses of IG must be administered. The site selec\u00ad ted should be well into the upper, outer mass of the glu\u00ad teus maximus and away from the central region of the but\u00ad tocks. Currently, preferred sites for intramuscular injec\u00ad tions are the anterolateral aspect of the upper thigh and the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. In most infants, the anterolateral aspect of the thigh provides the largest muscle mass and, therefore, is the preferred site. In older children, the deltoid mass is of suffi\u00ad cient size for intramuscular injection. An individual decision must be made for each child, based on the volume 62 of the injected material and the size of the muscle into which it is to be injected. Many practitioners prefer to continue using the anterolateral thigh until age three years before switching to the deltoid area. In adults, the deltoid is generally used for routine intramuscular vaccine administration. C. Techniques: Before giving the injection, the needle is inserted in the site, and the syringe plunger is pulled back to see if blood appears; if so, the needle should be withdrawn and a new site selected. The same procedure is followed until no blood appears. A separate needle and syringe should be used for each injection. Disposable needles and syringes should be discarded in labeled containers to prevent accidental inoculation or theft. If more than one vaccine preparation is admini\u00ad stered, each should be given at a different site. Dosage The recommended doses of immunobiologics are derived from theoretical considerations, experimental trials, and clinical experience. Administration of dose volumes smaller than those recommended, such as split doses or intradermal administration (unless specifically recommended), may result in inadequate protection. Exceeding the recommended dose volumes might be hazardous because of excessive local or systemic concentrations of antigens. Some practitioners use divided doses of vaccine (particularly diptheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine (DPT\u00bb to reduce reaction rates. There has not been adequate study of the efficacy of such practices by serologic confirmation or clinical efficacy or of the ef\u00ad fects on the subsequent frequency and severity of adverse reactions. The Committee does not recommend dividing doses of any vaccine. Hypersensitivity to Vaccine Components Vaccine antigens produced in systems or with sub\u00ad strates containing allergenic substances, e.g., antigens derived from growing microorganisms in embryonated chicken eggs, may cause hypersensitivity reactions. These reactions may include anaphylaxis when the final vaccine contains a substantial amount of the allergen. yellow fever vaccine is such an antigen. Vaccines with such characteristics should not be given to persons with 63 known hypersensitivity to components of the substrates. Contrary to this generalization, influenza vaccine anti\u00ad gens (whole or split), although prepared from viruses grown in embryonated eggs, are highly purified during preparation and have only very rarely been reported to be associated with hypersensitivity reactions. Live virus vaccines prepared by growing viruses in cell cultures are essentially devoid of potentially allergenic substances related to host tissue. On very rare occasions, hypersensitivity reactions to measles vaccine have been reported in persons with anaphylactic hypersensitivity to eggs. Measles vaccine, however, can be given safely to egg-allergic individuals provided the allergies are not manifested by anaphylactic symptoms. Since mumps vaccine is grown in similar cell cultures, the same precautions apply. Screening persons by history of ability to eat eggs without adverse effects is a reasonable way to identify those possibly at risk from receiving measles, mumps and influenza vaccine. Individuals with anaphylactic hypersensitivity to eggs (hives, swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, or shock)* should not be given these vaccines. Rubella vaccine is grown in human diploid cell culture and can be safely given, regardless of a history of allergy to eggs or egg proteins. Bacterial vaccines, such as cholera, DPT, plague, and typhoid, are frequently associated with local or systemic adverse effects; these common reactions do not appear to be allergic. Some vaccines contain preservatives (e.g., thimero\u00ad sal, a mercurial) or trace amounts of antibiotics (e.g., neomycin) to which patients may be hypersensitive. Those administering vaccines should carefully review the infor\u00ad mation provided with the package insert before deciding whether the rare patients with known hypersensitivity to such preservatives or antibiotics should be given the vaccine(s). No currently recommended vaccine contains penicillin or its derivatives. *Any of these signs or symptoms constitutes a systemic anaphylactic response. 64 Some vaccines (e.g., MMR vaccine or its individual component vaccines) contain trace amounts of neomycin. This amount is less than would usually be used for the skin test to determine hypersensitivity. Persons who have experienced anaphylactic reactions to neomycin should not receive these vaccines. Most often, neomycin allergy is a contact dermatitis, a manifestation of a de\u00ad layed-type (cell-mediated) immune response rather than anaphylaxis. In such individuals, the adverse reaction, if any, to neomycin in the vaccines would be an erythema\u00ad tous, pruritic papule at 48-96 hours. A history reactions to neomycin is not a contraindica\u00ad tion to receiving these vaccines. Altered Immunocompetence Virus replication after administration of live, at\u00ad tenuated-virus vaccines may be enhanced in persons with immune deficiency diseases, and in those with suppressed capability for immune response, as occurs with leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, or therapy with corti\u00ad costeroids, alkylating agents, antimetabolites, or radia\u00ad tion. Patients with such conditions should not be given live, attenuated-virus vaccines. Because of the possibi\u00ad lity of familial immunodeficiency, live, attenuated-virus vaccines should not be given to a member of a household in which there is a family history of congenital or here\u00ad ditary immunodeficiency until the immune competence of the potential recipient is known. OPV should not be given to a member of a household in which there is a family history of immunodeficiency or immunosuppression, regardless whether acquired or hereditary, until the im\u00ad mune status of the recipient and the other family members is known. Individuals residing in the household of a im\u00ad munocompromised individual should not receive OPV, be\u00ad cause vaccine viruses are excreted by the recipient of the vaccine and may be communicable to other persons. Severe Febrile Illnesses Minor illnesses, such as mild upper-respiratory in\u00ad fections, should not postpone vaccine administration. However, immunization of persons with severe febrile illnesses should generally be deferred until they have recovered. This precaution is to avoid superimposing ad\u00ad verse effects from the vaccine on the underlying illness or mistakenly identifying a manifestation of the under\u00ad lying illness as a result of the vaccine. In persons whose compliance with medical care cannot be assured, it is particularly important to take every opportunity to provide appropriate vaccinations. Vaccination During Pregnancy 65 On the grounds of a theoretical risk to the devel\u00ad oping fetus, live, attenuated-virus vaccines are not ge\u00ad nerally given to pregnant women or to those likely to be\u00ad come pregnant within three months after receiving vac\u00ad cine{s). With some of these vaccines--particularly ru\u00ad bella, measles, and mumps--pregnancy is a contraindica\u00ad tion. Both yellow fever vaccine and OPV can be given to pregnant women at substantial risk of exposure to natural infection. When vaccine is to be given during pregnancy, waiting until the second or third trimester to minimize any concern over teratogenicity is a reasonable precau\u00ad tion. If a pregnant women receives a live, attenuated\u00ad virus vaccine, there is not necessarily any real risk to the fetus. In particular, although there are theoretical risks in giving rubella vaccine during pregnancy, data if any, or teratogenicity from live rubella vaccine is quite small. There has been no evidence of congenital rubella syndrome in infants born to susceptible mothers who re\u00ad ceived rubella vaccine during pregnancy. Since persons given measles, mumps, or rubella vaccine viruses do not transmit them, these vaccines may be administered with safety to chidren of pregnant women. Although live polio virus is shed by children recently immunized with OPV (particularly following the first dose), this vaccine can also be administered to children of pregnant women. Polio immunization of children should not be delayed because of pregnancy in close adult contacts. Experience to date has not revealed any risks of poliovaccine virus to the fetus. There is no convincing evidence of risk to the fetus from immunization of pregnant women using inactivated vi\u00ad rus vaccines, bacterial vaccines, or toxoids. Tetanus and diphtheria toxoid (Td) should be given to inadequate\u00ad ly immunized pregnant women because it affords protection against neonatal tetanus. There is no risk to the fetus from passive immunization of pregnant women with IG (see below). For further information regarding immunization of pregnant women, refer to the American College of Ob\u00ad stetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Technical Bulletin Number 14, May 1982. 66 Adverse Events Following Immunization* Modern vaccines are extremely safe and effective, but not completely so. Adverse events following immuni\u00ad zation have been reported with all vaccines. These range from frequent, minor, local reactions to extremely rare, severe, systemic illness such as paralysis associated with oPV. To improve knowledge about adverse reactions, all temporally associated events severe enough to require the recipient to seek medical attention should be evaluated and reported in detail to local or state health officials and to the vaccine manufacturer. It is fre\u00ad quently impossible to establish cause-and-effect rela\u00ad tionships when untoward events occur after receiving vac\u00ad cine(s) since temporal association alone does not neces\u00ad sarily indicate causation. *More complete information on adverse reactions to a specific vaccine may be found in the ACIP recommendations for specific vaccines.

If initiated in the first year of life, give DTP- 1, 2, and 3, OPV-l and according to this schedule and give MMR when the chid becomes 15 months old. DTP\u00ad Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids with pertussis vaccine. DTP may be used up to the seventh birthday. OPV-Oral, attenuated poliovirus vaccine contains poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3. MMR-Live measles, mumps, and rubella viruses in a combined vaccine (see text for discussion of single vaccines versus combination). **The preschool dose is not necessary if the fourth dose of DTP and third dose of OPV are administered after the fourth birthday. Td-Adult tetanus toxoid and diphtheria toxoid in combination, which contains the same dose of tetanus toxoid as DTP or DT and a reduced dose of diphtheria toxoid. 69 Committee Report on Infectious Diseases Syringes and needles used for vaccine injections should preferably be disposable; a separate needle and syringe should be used for each immunization. Needles and syringes should be disposed of in specially labelled containers to prevent accidental innoculation. For subcutaneous or intradermal injections, a 25 gauge needle, 5/8 inch long is recommended; for intramus\u00ad cular injections, a 20 or 22 gauge needle, 1 to 1 1/4 in\u00ad ches long is recommended. Intradermal injections are usually given in the an\u00ad terior surface of the forearm. Subcutaneous injections can be given anywhere (including the abdomen in rabies vaccination), but they are usually given in the extensor or lateral surface of the upper arm. Intramuscular injections can be given in the upper, outer quadrant of the buttocks (with care to avoid the region of the scia\u00ad tic nerve), the midlateral areas of the thigh, or the deltoid muscle. The child should be well restrained before the injection. Each injection should be given at a different site. Prior to giving the injection, the syringe plunger should be pulled back to see if blood appears; if so, the needle should be relocated (American Academy of Pedia\u00ad trics, 1982). APPENDIX F CRITERIA FOR SUBJECT PARTICIPATION 1. Is this the child's third OPT immunization? 2. Was the last immunization over six weeks ago? 3. Is the child between five to seven months of age? 4. Do the parents have a phone? 5. Do the parents speak English? 6. Did the child have a severe reaction (convulsions, high fever ~ 39 degrees C, shock, screaming) with the prior two immunizations? 7. Has the child had a fever within the past 24 hours (~ 38 degrees C)? 71 REFERENCES American Academy of Pediatrics, (1982).
