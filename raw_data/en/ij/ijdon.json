CDC's Advi-sory Committee on Pasteur,Prevention and Control of Meningococcal Disease Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Prepared by Oleg O. Bilukha, MD, PhD Nancy Rosenstein, MD Division of Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases Summary In January 2005, a tetravalent Pennsylvania) licensed for use among persons aged 11-55 years. CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine vaccination of young adolescents (defined in this report aspersons aged 11-12 years) with MCV4 at the preadolescent health-care visit (at age 11-12 years). Introducing a recommenda- tion for MCV4 vaccination among young adolescents might strengthen the role of the preadolescent visit and have a positive effe ct on vaccine coverage among adolescents. For those persons who have not previously received MCV4, ACIP recommends vaccina- tion before high-school entry (at approximately age 15 years) as an effective strategy to reduce meningococcal disease incidenc e among adolescents and young adults. By 2008, the goal will be routine vaccination with MCV4 of all adolescents beginning atage 11 years. Routine vaccination with meningococcal vaccine also is recommended for college freshmen living in dormitories andfor other populations at increased risk (i.e., military recruits, travelers to areas in which meningococcal disease is hyperend emic or epidemic, microbiologists who are routinely exposed to isolates of Neisseria meningitidis , patients with anatomic or functional asplenia, and patients with terminal complement deficiency). Other adolescents, college students, and persons infected withhuman immunodeficiency virus who wish to decrease their risk for meningococcal disease may elect to receive vaccine. This report updates previous reports from ACIP concerning prevention and control of meningococcal disease. It also provides updated recommendations regarding use of the tetravalent meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) and on antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis. Inc., Swiftwater, Pennsylvania) for use among certain popula-tions at increased risk, including travelers to countries with epidemic or hyperendemic meningococcal disease, personswho have certain medical conditions (i.e., terminal comple- ment component deficiencies and anatomic or functionalasplenia), and laboratory personnel who are routinely exposedto N. meningitdis in solutions that might be aerosolized ( 3). Use of this vaccine also was recommended for control of men-ingococcal disease outbreaks ( 4). Recommendations permit- ting use of MPSV4 among college freshmen have been published previously ( 5). The new tetravalent A, C, Y, W-135 conjugate vaccine (Menactra, manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur, Inc.) licensedfor persons aged 11-55 years should become a key addition to existing meningococcal disease prevention measures. Thisreport provides ACIP's recommendations on prevention and control of meningococcal disease, including recommendations on use of the new tetravalent conjugate vaccine (MCV4) aswell as updated recommendations on use of the polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) and on antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis.

Corresponding preparer: Oleg Bilukha, MD, PhD, National Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC, 1600 Clifton Road NE, MS C-09, Epidemiology of Meningococcal Disease Each year, an estimated 1,400-2,800 cases of meningococ- cal disease occur in the United States, a rate of 0.5-1.1/100,000 population (CDC, unpublished data, 2004). N. meningitidis colonizes mucosal surfaces of nasopharynx and is transmitted through direct contact with large droplet respiratory secre- tions from the patients or asymptomatic carriers. Humans are the only host. Despite the continued sensitivity of meningo-coccus to multiple widely available antibiotics, including peni- cillin ( 6,7), the case-fatality ratio for meningococcal disease is 10%-14% (CDC, unpublished data, 2004). Meningococcal disease also causes substantial morbidity; 11%-19% of survi- vors have sequelae (e.g., neurologic loss, and hearing loss) ( 8,9). During 1991-2002, the highest rate of meningococcal disease (9.2/100,000) occurred among infants aged <1 year; the rate for persons aged 11-19 years (1.2/ 100,000) also was higher than that for the general population(Figure 1). Although rates of disease are highest among chil- dren aged <2 years, 62% of meningococcal disease in the United States occurs among persons aged >11 years (CDC, unpublished data, 2004). In the United States, >98% of cases of meningococcal dis- ease are sporadic; however, since 1991, the frequency of local- ized outbreaks has increased ( 10,11 ). The proportion of meningococcal cases caused by serogroup Y increased from 2% during 1989-1991 ( 12) to 37% during 1997-2002 (CDC, unpublished data, 2004). Serogroups B, C, and Y arethe major causes of meningococcal disease in the United States,each being responsible for approximately one third of cases.The proportion of cases caused by each serogroup varies byage group. Among infants aged <1 year, >50% of cases arecaused by serogroup B, for which no vaccine is licensed or available in the United States ( 13,14 ). Of all cases of menin- gococcal disease among persons aged >11 years, 75% are caused by serogroups (C, Y, or W-135), which are included in vac-cines available in the United States (CDC, unpublished data, 2004). Persons who have deficiencies in the terminal common complement pathway (C3, C5-9) ( 15,16 ) and those with anatomic or functional asplenia ( 17) are at increased risk for acquiring meningococcal disease. Antecedent viral infection, household crowding, chronic underlying illness, and both active and passive smoking also are associated with increasedrisk for meningococcal disease ( 18-25 ). During outbreaks, bar or nightclub patronage and alcohol use also have beenassociated with higher risk for meningococcal disease ( 26-28 ). In the United States, blacks and persons of low socioeco- nomic status (SES) have been consistently at higher risk formeningococcal disease ( 12,13 ). However, race and low SES are likely risk markers rather than risk factors for this disease. A multistate case-control study in which controls were matched to case-patients by age group indicated that in a multivariableanalysis (controlling for sex and education), active and pas- sive smoking, recent respiratory illness, corticosteroid use, new residence, new school, Medicaid insurance, and household crowding all were associated with increased risk for meningo- coccal disease, whereas income and race were not ( 18). Addi- tional research is needed to identify groups at risk that might benefit from prevention efforts. Meningococcal Disease and College Students Multiple studies have been conducted in the United States (29-31 ) and the United Kingdom ( 32,33 ) concerning the risk for meningococcal disease among college students. The risk for meningococcal disease among U.S. college students washigher for those who resided in dormitories than for those residing in other types of accommodations. Overall incidence among college students usually is similar to or somewhat lowerthan that observed among persons in the general population of similar age. The earliest of these studies (conducted during the 1990- 91 and 1991-92 academic years) had a poor response rate(38%) and indicated a low overall incidence of meningococ- cal disease among U.S. college students (1.0/100,000 popu-lation/year) ( 31). Cases of meningococcal disease occurred 9-23 times more frequently among students living in dormi-tories than among those living in other types of accommoda-FIGURE 1.

A retrospective cohort study conducted in Maryland during 1992-1997 ( 30) indicated that the overall incidence of meningococcal disease among college students was similar to that among the U.S. population of persons the same age (1.7/100,000 and 1.4/100,000, respectively); however, ratesof disease among students living in dormitories were higher than rates among students living off campus (3.2/100,000 and 1.0/100,000, respectively; p = 0.05). U.S. surveillance data from the 1998-99 school year ( 29) indicated that the overall rate of meningococcal disease amongundergraduate college students was lower than the rate amongpersons aged 18-23 years who were not enrolled in college (0.7 and 1.4/100,000, respectively) (Table 1). Rates were some- what higher among freshmen (1.9/100,000). Among theapproximately 600,000 freshmen living in dormitories, rates were higher (5.1/100,000) than among any age group in the population other than children aged <2 years but lower thanthe threshold (10/100,000) recommended for initiating men- ingococcal vaccination campaigns ( 4). In a case-control study involving 50 cases detected among college students ( 29), mul- tivariate analysis indicated that freshmen living in dormito-ries were at higher risk for meningococcal disease than other students (matched odds ratio [OR]: 3.6; 95% confidenceinterval [CI] = 1.6-8.5). In the United Kingdom, rates of meningococcal disease were higher among university students than among nonstudents of similar age ( 32). Regression analysis indicated that the main risk factor was catered hall accommodations (the U.K. equiva- lent of U.S. dormitories). A recent study conducted in the United Kingdom demonstrated a rapid increase in carriage rates of meningococci among university students in the firstweek of the fall semester, although rates of disease peaked laterin the academic year ( 33). The increased rate of disease among university students has prompted the United Kingdom to ini-tiate routine vaccination of incoming university students with a bivalent A/C polysaccharide vaccine as part of a new vacci- nation program ( 34). In 2000, ACIP and the Committee on Infectious Diseases of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) concluded thatcollege students, especially those living in dormitories, are atmoderately increased risk for meningococcal disease compared with other persons their age ( 5). ACIP and AAP recommended that 1) college students and their parents be informed by health-care providers of the risks of meningococcal disease and of the potential benefits of vaccination with MPSV4; 2) col- lege and university health services facilitate implementationof educational programs about meningococcal disease and the availability of vaccination services; and 3) MPSV4 be made available to those persons requesting vaccination. As ofNovember 2004, a total of 31 states had adopted legislation requiring colleges to provide information on risks of menin- gococcal disease either to matriculating students or to stu-dents residing on campus, and 10 states had mandated vaccination for certain students, unless a vaccination waiver is provided (Figure 2) ( 35). In 2004, the American College Health Association con- ducted an Internet-based survey of college policies and prac-tices related to meningococcal vaccination ( 36). Of the 72 (10%) contacted colleges and universities that responded, 60%reported having a written policy on meningococcal vaccina-tion, and 80% reported conducting some type of outreach awareness program among college students or their parents. Median vaccination rates reported for the 2002-03 and2003-04 academic years were 20% and 35%, respectively; FIGURE 2.

On the basis of the number of vaccine dosessold, during the 2004-05 academic year, approximately 1.1 million college students received MPSV4 before arrival on campus, and an estimated 50,000-100,000 students receivedvaccine after arrival on campus (Sanofi Pasteur, Inc., unpub- lished data, 2004). Evaluation and Management of Suspected Outbreaks of Meningococcal Disease Since the early 1990s, outbreaks of meningococcal disease have occurred with increasing frequency in the United States.During July 1994-June 2002, a total of 76 outbreaks were identified (annual median: 10; range: 4-16) ( 11), including 48 by serogroup C, 19 (25%) by serogroup B, and nine (12%) by serogroup Y. These outbreaks occurred in 32 states and involved 247 patients (accountingfor <2% of total cases of meningococcal disease in the United States during this period). Of the 76 outbreaks, 26 (34%) were community-based and accounted for 53% of all outbreak-related cases. Of the 50 (65%) outbreaks that were organization-based, 13 (26%) occurred in colleges; 19 (38%) in primary and secondary schools; and nine (18% ) in nursing homes. Vaccination campaigns (using an average of 2,500 doses of MPSV4 per outbreak) were conducted in 34 outbreaks (30of which were caused by serogroup C and four by serogroup Y) (11). The decision to implement a mass vaccination campaign to prevent meningococcal disease depends on whether theoccurrence of more than one case represents an outbreak or an unusual clustering of endemic disease. Because the num-ber of cases in outbreaks is usually not substantial, this deter- mination often requires evaluation and analysis of the patterns of disease occurrence. Mass vaccination campaigns are expen-sive, require a massive public health effort, and can create unwarranted concern among the public. Detailed informa- tion on evaluation and management of suspected outbreakshas been published previously ( 4) and is presented in this report. Case Definitions The following case definitions are used in this report:\u007fConfirmed case. A confirmed case of meningococcal dis- ease is one that is defined by isolation of N. meningitdis from a normally sterile site (e.g., blood or cerebrospinalfluid) from a person with clinically compatible illness.\u007fProbable case. A probable case of meningococcal disease is one that is defined by detection of polysaccharide anti-gen in cerebrospinal fluid (e.g., by latex agglutination, polymerase chain reaction, or immunohistochemistry) or the presence of clinical purpura fulminans in the absenceof diagnostic culture from a person with clinically compatible illness ( 37). \u007fPPPPPrimarrimarrimarrimarrimar y case.y case.y case.y case.y case. A primary case of meningococcal disease is one that occurs in the absence of previous known closecontact with another patient. \u007fSecondary case. A secondary case of meningococcal dis- ease is one that occurs among close contacts of a primarypatient >24 hours after onset of illness in the primary patient. \u007fCo-primary cases. Co-primary cases are two or more cases that occur among a group of close contacts with onset of illness separated by <24 hours. \u007fClose contacts. Close contacts of a patient who has meningococcal disease include 1) household members;2) child-care center contacts; and 3) persons directlyexposed to by endotracheal tube management). Organization- and Community- Based Outbreaks An outbreak usually is classified as organization-based if it involves the occurrence of three or more confirmed or prob- able cases of meningococcal disease of the same serogroup in <3 months among persons who have a common affiliationbut no close contact with each other, resulting in primary dis-ease attack rate of >10 cases/100,000 persons. Calculation of attack rates for organization-based outbreaks is most usefulfor large organizations (e.g., universities). However, in themajority of organization-based outbreaks with three or even two cases of disease, the rate will be >10 cases/100,000 popu- lation. In such situations, public health officials also mightconsider vaccination after only two primary cases are identified. An outbreak is classified as community-based if it involves the occurrence of three or more confirmed or probable casesof meningococcal disease in <3 months among persons resid- ing in the same area who are not close contacts of each otherand who do not share a common affiliation, with a primarydisease attack rate of >10 cases/100,000 persons. Distinguish- ing whether an outbreak should be classified as organization-or community-based is complicated by the fact that, in cer-tain instances, these types of outbreaks occur simultaneously.Vol. 54 / RR-7 Recommendations and Reports 5 Population at Risk In addition to close contacts, persons considered to be at increased risk for meningococcal disease compared with historical rates of disease in the same population in the gen- eral U.S. population are classified as being at risk. The popu- lation at risk is used as the denominator in calculations of thedisease attack rate. The population at risk is usually defined on the basis of organizational affiliation or community of resi- dence. In organization-based outbreaks, cases are linked by acommon affiliation other than a shared, geographically delin- eated community; the population at risk is thus usually the group of persons who best represent that affiliation. Forexample, if the only association between patients is attending the same school or university, the population at risk is all per- sons attending the school or university. In community-basedoutbreaks, patients have no common affiliation other than a shared, geographically defined community. The population at risk can be defined as the smallest geographically contigu-ous population that includes all (or nearly all) patients. This population is usually a neighborhood, town, city, or county, whose size is obtained from census data. Attack Rate and Decision To Vaccinate For a primary attack rate to be calculated, all confirmed cases of the same serogroup should be summed; secondarycases should be excluded and each set of co-primary cases counted as one case. Because attack rates are calculated both to characterize the risk for disease among the general popula-tion and to determine whether overall rates have increased, related cases (secondary and co-primary) should not be included. From an epidemiologic perspective, secondary andco-primary cases can be considered as representing single epi- sodes of disease with direct spread to one or more close contact(s), which is consistent with endemic disease. If three or more cases have occurred in either an organiza- tion- or a community-based outbreak during <3 months (start- ing at the time of the first confirmed or probable case), aprimary attack rate should be calculated. Because of the lim- ited number of cases typically involved and the seasonal pat- terns of meningococcal disease (more cases occur during fallthan other times of the year), rate calculations should not be annualized. The following formula is used to calculate attack rates: Attack rate per 100,000 = [(number of primary confirmed or probable cases during a 3-month period) / (number of popu-lation at risk)] x 100,000 Vaccination of the population at risk should be considered if the attack rate is >10 cases/100,000 persons. The actualattack rate at which the decision to vaccinate is made varies.Public health personnel should consider the following factors:1) completeness of case reporting and number of possible casesof meningococcal disease for which bacteriologic confirma- tion or serogroup data are not available; 2) occurrence of additional cases of meningococcal disease after recognition ofa suspected outbreak (e.g., if the outbreak occurred 2 months previously and if no additional cases have occurred, in which case vaccination might be unlikely to prevent additional casesof meningococcal disease); and 3) logistic and financial con- siderations. Because available vaccines are not effective against N. meningitdis serogroup B, vaccination should not be considered during serogroup B outbreaks. Vaccination Group Those persons designated to be administered vaccine dur- ing a vaccination campaign comprise a vaccination group. Thevaccination group usually includes either the whole or a sub- set of the population of risk. Because meningococcal disease outbreak cases occur predominantly among persons aged<30 years ( 10,11 ), and available vaccines are not recommended among children aged <2 years, the vaccination group usuallyis that portion of the population at risk aged 2-29 years. In the majority of organization-based outbreaks, the vacci- nation group includes the whole population at risk, providedthat all persons are aged >2 years. If a substantial proportion of patients are aged <2 years and thus are not eligible toreceive vaccine, patients aged <2 years should be excluded,and, if at least three patients remain, the attack rate should be recalculated. If the recalculated attack rate remains >10 cases/100,000 persons, vaccination should be considered forpart or all of the population at risk aged >2 years. In certain organization-based outbreaks, a vaccination group larger thanthe population at risk might be designated. For example, in ahigh school in which all outbreak-associated cases occurred among students, authorities might decide to offer vaccine to staff. In community-based outbreaks, the vaccination groupusually can be defined as a subset of the population at risk (e.g., persons aged 2-29 years). If a substantial proportion of patients are aged <2 years, these patients might be excluded from calculation of an attack rate. In rare situations (e.g., in a town with a limited population) in which multiple cases have occurred among adults aged >29 years, the entire populationaged >2 years might be considered for vaccination. For more substantial populations, this decision would be costly in termsof finances and human resources, and restricting the vaccina-tion group to the persons in age groups with the highest attack rates might be more appropriate. Age-specific attack rates can be calculated by using the formula previously pro-vided and by restricting the numerator and denominator to6 MMWR May 27, 2005 persons within specific age groups (e.g., persons aged 2-29 years). Genotyping of N. meningitdis Isolates Genotyping of N. meningitdis isolates by using such meth- ods as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis or ribotyping might pro-vide useful information for determining whether a group ofcases represents an outbreak ( 38). Outbreaks of meningococ- cal disease usually are caused by closely related strains.Genotyping data can allow identification of an outbreak strainand help to better define the extent of the outbreak. If strains from a group of patients are unrelated by genotyping, the group of cases most likely does not represent an outbreak. Becausemolecular subtyping testing might not be readily available or accessible, initiation of outbreak-control efforts should not be delayed until genotyping results are available. Other Control Measures Mass chemoprophylaxis (i.e., administration of antibiotics to substantial populations) is not recommended to controllarge outbreaks of disease. Disadvantages of mass chemopro-phylaxis include cost of the drug and administration, diffi- culty of ensuring simultaneous administration of drugs to substantial populations, drug side effects, and emergence of resistant organisms. In addition, multiple sources and pro- longed risk for exposure make this approach impractical andunlikely to succeed. In the majority of outbreak settings, these disadvantages outweigh the possible benefit in disease pre- vention. However, in outbreaks involving limited populations(e.g., an outbreak in a single school), administration of chemo- prophylaxis might be considered ( 39), especially in serogroup B outbreaks, for which available vaccines are not effective ( 40). When making a decision about initiating mass chemopro-phylaxis in these settings, public health officials should con- sider not only the potential for prevention of new cases butalso the logistics, cost, and potential for developing antimi- crobial resistance ( 39,41 ). If mass chemoprophylaxis is undertaken, it should be administered to all targeted persons at the same time. In the United States, measures that have not been recommended for control of meningococcal disease out- breaks include restricting travel to areas with an outbreak, clos-ing schools or universities, or canceling sporting or social events. Educating communities, physicians, and other health-care workers about meningococcal disease to promote an early caserecognition and early care-seeking behaviors is an important part of managing suspected meningococcal disease outbreaks.Education efforts should be initiated as soon as an outbreakof meningococcal disease is suspected ( 4).

(Menomune-A,C,Y,W-135, manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur, Inc., Swiftwater, Pennsylvania) available in the United States ( 42). Each dose consists of the four (A, C, Y, W-135) purified bacterial capsular polysaccharides (50 Vaccine Immunogenicity and Efficacy The immunogenicity and clinical efficacy of the serogroups A and C meningococcal vaccines have been well established.The serogroup A polysaccharide induces antibody response among certain children as young as age 3 months, although aresponse comparable with that occurring in adults is not achieved until age 4-5 years; the serogroup C component is poorly immunogenic among recipients aged <18-24 months (43,44 ). The serogroups A and C vaccines have demonstrated estimated clinical efficacies of >85% among school-aged chil- dren and adults and are useful in controlling outbreaks(45-49 ). Serogroups Y and W-135 polysaccharides are safe and immunogenic among adults and children aged >2 years (50-52 ); although clinical protection has not been docu- mented, vaccination with these polysaccharides induces pro-duction of bactericidal antibodies. The antibody responses toeach of the four polysaccharides in the tetravalent vaccine are serogroup specific and independent. Persons whose spleens have been removed because of trauma or nonlymphoid tumors and persons who have inheritedcomplement deficiencies have acceptable antibody responses to polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine ( 53-55 ). tetravalent polysaccharide vaccine sub- stantially reduced the incidence of invasive meningococcal disease among patients with terminal complement deficiencycompared with similar patients who were unvaccinated ( 16). Reduced clinical efficacy has not been demonstrated among persons who have received multiple doses of vaccine. How-ever, recent serologic studies have reported that multiple doses of serogroup A and C polysaccharide vaccine might cause immunologic hyporesponsiveness (i.e., a reduced antibodyVol. 54 / RR-7 Recommendations and Reports 7 response after subsequent challenge with the same polysac- charide antigen) to group clinical relevance of such hyporesponsiveness is unclear. Duration of Protection Among infants and children aged <5 years, measurable lev- els of antibodies against group A and C polysaccharidesdecreased substantially during the first 3 years after a single dose of vaccine; among healthy adults, antibody levels alsodecreased, but antibodies were still detectable <10 years after vaccine administration ( 43,60-63 ). Similarly, although vaccine-induced clinical protection likely persists amongschool-aged children and adults for >3 years, the efficacy of the group A vaccine among children aged <5 years mightdecrease markedly within this period. In one study, efficacyamong children aged <4 years at the time of vaccination declined from >90% to <10% within 3 years after vaccina- tion; efficacy was 67% among children who were aged >4 years when vaccinated ( 64). Precautions and Contraindications Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines have been used extensively in mass vaccination programs as well as in the mili- tary and among international travelers. Adverse reactions to polysaccharide meningococcal vaccines are usually mild; themost frequent reaction is pain and redness at the injection site, lasting for 1-2 days. Estimates of the incidence of such local reactions have varied (range: 4%-56%) ( 65,66 ). In cer- tain studies, transient fever occurred among <5% of persons vaccinated, more commonly among infants ( 44,67 ). Severe reactions to polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine are uncommon ( 44,52,65-71 ). The majority of studies report the rate of systemic allergic reactions (e.g., urticaria,wheezing, and rash) as 0-0.1/100,000 vaccine doses ( Vaccines Bacterial polysaccharides, including those comprising the N. meningitdis , are T-cell-independent antigens. T-cell-independent antigens do not elicit memory response; they stimulate mature B-lymphocytes but not T-lymphocytes,thus inducing a response that is neither long-lasting nor char-acterized by an anamnestic response after subsequent chal-lenge with the same polysaccharide antigen ( 72). Thus, meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines have inherent limita-tions. The serogroup C immunogenicamong years ( 73-75 ). The A polysaccharide induces antibody response in infants, but vaccine efficacydeclines rapidly ( 64). Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines do not confer long-lasting immunity ( 61,64 ); they also do not cause a sustainable reduction of nasopharyngeal carriageof N. meningitdis (76,77 ) and therefore do not substantially interrupt transmission to elicit herd immunity. Finally, mul- tiple doses of serogroup A and C polysaccharide vaccine might cause immunologic hyporesponsiveness to the ( 58,59 ) polysaccharide, although implications of this phenomenon are unknown. Conjugation (i.e., covalent coupling) of polysaccharide to a protein carrier that contains T-cell epitopes changes the nature of immune response to polysaccharide from T-cell- independent to T-cell-dependent, leading to a substantial pri-mary response among infants and a strong anamnestic response at re-exposure ( 78). Both conjugate Hib and conjugate S. pneumoniae vaccines (introduced for mass infant immuni- zation in the United States in 1990 and 2000, respectively)have reduced incidence of disease caused by vaccine- preventable serotypes ( 1,79). In addition, both carriage of respective bacteria ( 80-82 ), thus protecting unvaccinated persons through a herd immu-nity effect ( 1). Meningococcal Serogroup C Conjugate Vaccine in the United Kingdom In November 1999, monovalent serogroup C conjugate vaccines were introduced in the United Kingdom. The national vaccination campaign introduced a routine 3-dose infant vaccination series and implemented a mass catch-up campaign during 1999-2000 targeting all persons aged12 months-17 years ( 34). The three serogroup C conjugate vaccines used in the United Kingdom are Meningtec (WyethLederle Vaccines and Pediatrics, Pearl River, New York);Menjugate (Chiron Vaccines, Siena, Italy); and NeisVac (Baxter Hyland Immuno, Beltsville, Maryland). to CRM197, a nontoxic third vaccine (NeisVac) meningo- in this campaign were licensed on the8 MMWR May 27, 2005 basis of data on safety and immunogenicity but without data on clinical efficacy ( 85). By 2001-2002, vaccine coverage in the United Kingdom was estimated as 80% among infants, 84% among toddlers,76% among preschoolers, and 86%-87% amongschoolchildren ( 86). Effectiveness of the vaccine within the first year of vaccination ranged from 88% to 98% among dif-ferent age groups ( 87-89 ). Insufficient data are available to differentiate efficacy of the three meningococcal conjugate vac- cines. Because the vaccine campaign was initiated only in 1999, long-term data on duration of protection are not yet avail-able. However, among infants who received 3 doses of vac- cine at ages 2, 3, and 4 months, efficacy declined to -81% (95% CI = -7,430-71) after only 1 year ( 88). Although the number of cases remains low, likely in part as a result of vaccine- induced herd immunity, this study raises questions about the meningococcal vaccine schedule and the need for a boosterdose. During 1999-2000, carriage rates of group C meningo- cocci in the United Kingdom declined 66% ( 90). In addi- tion, incidence of meningococcal serogroup C disease declined 67% among unvaccinated persons aged 1-17 years and 35% among persons aged >25 years who were not targeted for vac-cination, indicating the additional vaccine benefit of eliciting herd immunity ( 86). Meningococcal Tetravalent (Menactra, manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur, Inc., Swiftwater,Pennsylvania) that was licensed for use in the United States in January 2005. A 0.5-mL single dose of vaccine contains 4 \u00b5g each of capsular polysaccharide from serogroups A, C, Y, W-135 conjugated to 48 \u00b5g of diphtheria toxoid. MCV4 is available only in single-dose vials. Immunologic Correlates of Protection Studies among U.S. military recruits conducted in the 1960s indicated that the absence of naturally acquired bactericidal antibodies, measured by a serum bactericidal antibody assay(SBA) using an intrinsic human complement source, was associated with susceptibility to meningococcal group C dis- ease. SBA titers >4 using human serum as an exogenous complement source (hSBA) are considered the standard cor- relate of clinical protection against serogroup C meningococ- cal disease ( 91).Serogroup C conjugate meningococcal vaccines were licensed in the United Kingdom on the basis of data on safetyand immunogenicity, without data on clinical efficacy ( 85). The immunologic data supporting the use of conjugateserogroup C vaccines were generated by serum bactericidalassay by using baby rabbit complement (rSBA). The thresh- old values were validated by comparing rSBA titers with those obtained by using hSBA ( licensure in the United Kingdom, titers of >128 were considered to predict pro- tection; however, only 60% of rSBA titers in of >4. For rSBA titers in this equivocal range, a fourfold rise in titers pre- to postvaccination was also proposed as a correlate of protection ( 92). Further evaluation of these threshold values was performed by using vaccine efficacy estimates from postlicensure surveil-lance, which indicated that these threshold values provided a conservative estimate of short-term clinical efficacy; rSBAthreshold of >128 underestimated efficacy, with rSBA cutoffs of >4->8 at 4 weeks after vaccination being most consistent with observed clinical efficacy ( 93). On the basis of these effi- cacy estimates, the proportion of responders in multiple clini- cal trials of meningococcal C conjugate vaccines, and the group C seroprevalence study conducted before introduction of groupC conjugate vaccines ( 94), rSBA titers of <8 have been pro- posed to be predictive of susceptibility to invasive meningo-coccal disease, and rSBA titers of >8 have been proposed to correlate with short-term protection ( 95). Limited or no similar data exist to link immune response with clinical efficacy forserogroups A, Y, or W-135. In 1981, MPSV4 (Menomune) was licensed in the United States on the basis of data on safety and immunogenicity.Immunogenicity of this vaccine was compared with that of the vaccine then licensed for use in the United States, A/C meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine, which had demon-strated 97% efficacy A and 90% efficacy against serogroup C ( 96). The immunologic criterion used for licensing was a fourfold or greater rise in SBA among 90% of adults at 3-4 weeks after vaccination. As a result, in 2005, MCV4 (Menactra) was licensed on the basis of findings indi- cating that it was not inferior to MPSV4 in terms of immu-nogenicity and safety (i.e., demonstrated noninferiority). A primary criterion in determining immunogenic noninferiority of the new vaccine was the percentage of vaccinees having afourfold or greater increase in bactericidal antibody for MCV4 compared with MPSV4.Vol. 54 / RR-7 Recommendations and Reports 9 Immunogenicity Immunogenicity Among Persons Aged 11-18 Years A randomized controlled trial conducted among persons aged 11-18 years compared immunogenicity of MCV4 withthat of MPSV4 at 28 days after vaccination. A similarpercentage of subjects achieved at least a fourfold rise in rSBA titers in MCV4 and MPSV groups (Table 2). The percentage of subjects with at least a fourfold rise in rSBA was highest forserogroup W-135 (96.7% in MCV4 group and in and lowest for serogroup Y (81.8% and 80.1%, respectively). The percentage of subjects achieving anrSBA geometric mean titer (GMT) of >128 was high (>98% conducted among per- sons aged 18-55 years compared immunogenicity of MCV4and that of MPSV4 at 28 days after vaccination. Although the percentage of subjects achieving at least a fourfold increase in rSBA titer for each serogroup was higher in the MPSV4group than in the MCV4 group (Table 2), the criteria for demonstrating immunologic noninferiority to MPSV4 were still achieved. As was the case among persons aged 11-18 years, this percentage was highest for serogroup W-135 (89.4% in the MCV4 group and 94.4% group) and low-est for serogroup Y (73.5% and 79.4%, respectively). The percentage subjects achieving an rSBA GMT of >128 washigh (>97% groups ( 97,98 ). Persistence of Antibodies After 3 Years and Response to Revaccination MCV4 was administered to 76 subjects previously vacci- nated with MCV4, 77 subjects previously vaccinated age-matched vaccine-na\u00efve subjects ( 97) (Sanofi Pasteur, Inc., unpublished data, 2004). Immunologic indices were measured before revaccination (day 0) and at days 8 and 28 after revaccination (Table 3). Subjects initially vaccinated with MCV4 had higher rSBA GMT at day 0 than those vaccinated with MPSV4 (Table 3);this difference was statistically significant for serogroups A (p<0.001) and W-135 (p<0.001). In addition, a higher per-centage of those initially vaccinated with MCV4 had rSBA titers of >128 than those initially vaccinated with MPSV4 (Table 3). Vaccine-na\u00efve subjects had lower rSBA on day 0 than subjects previously vaccinated with either MCV4 or MPSV4. Response to revaccination with MCV4 was assessed by administering MCV4 to subjects previously vaccinated withMPSV4 or MCV4 and to vaccine-na\u00efve control subjects. All subjects in all three groups achieved rSBA titers of >128 at both 8 and 28 days after receiving MCV4 (Table 3). Subjects initially primed with MCV4 achieved higher rSBA GMTs than na\u00efve control subjects for all serogroups except A. In contrast, rSBA GMTs of those primed with MPSV4 were lower than those of vaccine-na\u00efve control subjects on both days 8 and 28for all serogroups (Table 3). TABLE 2.

One group received Td and MCV4 concomi- tantly at separate injection sites, followed by a saline placebo28 days later; the other group received Td and a saline pla- cebo at separate injection sites, followed 28 days later by MCV4. Concomitant administration of Td and MCV4 didnot adversely affect immune response to either vaccine ( 97,98 ). When MCV4 and Td were administered concomitantly, antibody response to diphtheria antigen 28 days after vacci-nation was greater (diphtheria GMT 120.9 IU/mL) than when Td MCV4 Td first (diph- theria GMT 8.4 IU/mL 28 days after Td dose) followed byMCV4 28 days after Td (diphtheria GMT 16.9 IU/mL 28 days after MCV4 dose) ( 97). The prelicensure data demon- strated comparable overall safety profiles among adolescents who received simultaneous and sequential vaccination (Td followed by MCV4 28 days later). The immunological and safety profiles among adolescents receiving MCV4 followedby Td on a later date were not evaluated during prelicensure trials (see \"Safety of Concomitant Administration of MCV4 and Other Vaccines\"). Among adults aged 18-55 years, a randomized controlled trial assessed immunogenicity of MCV4 and typhoidvaccine 1) when MCV4 and typhoid vaccine were adminis-tered concomitantly and 2) when typhoid vaccine wasadministered concomitantly with placebo and MCV4 was ad-ministered 28 days later. Concomitant administration did notadversely affect immune response to either typhoid vaccine or MCV4 ( 97,98 ). Safety Systemic and Local Adverse Reactions Among persons aged 11-18 years, safety of MCV4 and MPSV4 was assessed in two randomized controlled trials (97,98 ). The percentage of subjects reporting systemic adverse events was similar for persons who received either vaccine. In one study, approximately half of the participants experienced at least one systemic adverse reaction, and <5% experiencedat least one severe systemic reaction. Fever (i.e., temperature >100\u00baF [>38\u00baC]) was reported by 5.1% of those who received MCV4 and by 3.0% of those who received MPSV4(Table 4). Among persons aged 18-55 years, the safety of MCV4 and of MPSV4 also were compared in two randomized controlledtrials. The percentage of subjects reporting systemic adverse events was similar for persons who received either vaccine. In one study, 62% of participants experienced at least onesystemic adverse reaction, and <4% experienced severe sys- temic reaction after receiving MCV4. Fever was reported by 1.5% of those who received MCV4 and by 0.5% of thosewho received MPSV4 (Table 4). Local adverse reactions were more common among those persons aged 11-18 years who received MCV4 than amongthose who received MPSV4 (Table 5); 13% Geometric mean titer (GMT) of serum bactericidal activity by using baby rabbit complement (rSBA) and percentage of subjects aged 14-21 years achieving rSBA GMT of >128 before (day 0) and at days 8 and 28 after revaccination with meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4) at 3 years after previous vaccination in three groups (primed with MCV4, primed with meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine [MPSV4], rSBA GMT Day 28, rSBA GMT Primed Primed Primed Primed Primed Primed with with Vaccine- with with Vaccine- 76) (n = 77) (n = 88) (n = 76) (n = 77) (n = 88) (n = 76) (n = 77) (n = 88) GMT A 1,082 171 84 9,393 and Drug Administration.

These differences in frequency of local reactions are related to the amount of diphtheria toxoid contained in each vaccine ( 99). The frequency of local adverse reactions reported after MCV4 was similar to that reported after Td vaccine ( 97,98 ). As with persons aged 11-18 years, local adverse reactions among persons aged 18-55 years were reported more com-monly by those who received MCV4 than by those who received MPSV4 (Table 5). However, the frequency of localadverse reactions reported by adults after MCV4 was similar to that reported after typhoid vaccine ( 97,98 ). Safety of Concomitant Administration of MCV4 and Other Vaccines Among persons aged 11-17 years, frequency of reported local adverse effects at MCV4 injection site in the group forwhich MCV4 was administered concomitantly with Td was similar to those in which MCV4 was administered 28 days after Td. The percentage (58.6%) of subjects reporting at leastone systemic adverse reaction after concomitant administra- tion of MCV4 and Td was similar to the percentage (54.1%)of systemic reactions reported after Td was administered concomitantly with a placebo. Among persons aged 18-55 years, the frequency of local and systemic adverse effects was similar for those receiving concomitant administration ofMCV4 and typhoid vaccine and those who received MCV4 28 days after receiving typhoid vaccine ( 97,98 ). Serious Adverse Events in All Safety Studies A total of 5,453 subjects aged 11-55 years who received MCV4 and 2,923 subjects in the same age group who received MPSV4 completed follow-up 6 months after vacci-nation. Serious adverse events reported within a 6-month period after vaccination occurred at the same rate (1.3%) in the MCV4 and MPSV4 groups. The events reported wereconsistent with events expected among healthy adolescent and adult populations ( 98).TABLE 4.

Best- and worst-case scenarios were evaluated by varying the cost of vaccine and administration (range: $54-$88), costs per hospitalization ($10,924- $24,030), the value of premature death on the basis of life- time productivity ($1.3 million-$4.8 million), the cost percase of vaccine side effects ($7,000-$24,540/1 million doses), and the average long-term cost of treating a case of sequelae of disease ($1,298-$14,600). Vaccination coverage (60% and100%, respectively) and vaccine efficacy (80% and 90%, respectively) also were varied for evaluation purposes. Vaccination of freshmen who live in dormitories would result in the administration of approximately 354,950-591,590 doses of vaccine each year, preventing 16-30 cases of meningococcal disease and one to three deaths each year. Thecost per case prevented would be an estimated $617,000-$1.85 million, at a cost per death prevented of $6.8-$20.4 million and a cost per life-year saved (LYS)* of $62,042-$489,185 (100). Vaccination of all freshmen would result in the admin- istration of approximately 1,364,400-2,274,000 doses of vac- cine each year, preventing 37-69 cases of meningococcal disease and two to five deaths each year. The cost per case prevented would be $1.4-$2.9 million, at a cost per deathprevented of $22-$48 million ( 100). These data are similar to data derived from previous studies ( 101). Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of MCV4 Vaccine Among AdolescentsAged 11 Years From a societal perspective, the economic costs and ben- efits of vaccinating a cohort of approximately 4,238,670 U.S. adolescents aged 11 years were evaluated, on the basis of an assumption that the benefits of vaccination would last 22 years(102). A multivariable (Monte Carlo) analysis was performed in which multiple parameters were varied simultaneously overspecified probability distributions. These parameters included disease incidence (46%-120% of the 10-year average), case- fatality ratio (34%-131% of the 10-year average), rates of long-term sequelae, acute meningococcal disease costs (i.e., inpatient care, parents' work loss, and public health response), lifetimecosts of meningococcal disease sequelae, and cost of vaccineand administration (range: $64-$114). Vaccination coverage (16%-95%) and vaccine efficacy (39%-99%) also were var- ied for evaluation purposes. Median program costs for vaccination of adolescents aged 11 years would be $227 million (5th-95th percentile: $158-$406 million). If a 3% discount rate were used for costs andbenefits, during a 22-year period, vaccination among adoles- cents would prevent 270 cases and 36 deaths (21 cases and three deaths in the first year). The median cost would of a Catch- Up Vaccination Campaign with MCV4 The direct and indirect (herd immunity) benefits of a one- time catch-up vaccination campaign with MCV4 of adoles- cents aged 11-17 years followed by routine annual vaccination of adolescents aged 11 years were analyzed (CDC, unpub-lished data, 2005). For this purpose, a probabilistic model of disease burden and economic impacts was built for a 10-year period with and without an adolescent catch-up program. U.S.age- and serogroup-specific surveillance data on incidence and case fatality rates were used, as were hypothetical age-specific reductions in attack rates among unvaccinated personsobtained on the basis of U.K. data ( 86,103 ). Medical, work loss, and public response costs were estimated with and with-out a catch-up campaign, as were lifetime costs of meningo-coccal disease sequelae. After disease and vaccination program costs were projected, estimated costs per case averted, deaths prevented, LYS, and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) saved were estimated. With herd immunity effects equivalent to recent experience in the United Kingdom, catch-up vaccination of adolescentsplus an added routine program would prevent 5,263 cases * The number of life-years saved as a result of a preventive intervention (i.e., the number of potential years of life expected if disease-specific events leading to premature death not occur [healthy life expectancy]). The number of life- years saved will be less or at the most equal to the number of potential yearslost pre-intervention. Because life expectancy is age-specific, life-years saved is often calculated as the difference between the age-specific healthy life expectancy and the age when a disease-specific event leading to prematuremortality could occur without the intervention.A measure based on individual preferences for states of health that assigns a value of 1 to a year of perfect health and 0 to death. QALYs measure not only years of life saved but also functioning and health preserved. QALYs arehighly relevant when disease-specific outcomes lead to both mortality (i.e., premature death) and substantial morbidity (i.e., temporal or permanent disability). Thus, effectiveness outcomes are expressed as change in health status.Vol. 54 / RR-7 Recommendations and Reports 13 during a 10-year period, a 32% reduction in the number of cases. Excluding program costs, the catch-up program wouldsave $338 million in medical and public response costs and $591 million in time off from work, long-term disability, and premature death. At a hypothetical cost of $83 per vaccinee, acatch-up vaccination program (including 9 years of routine vaccination) would cost society approximately $3.6 billion (45% of this sum in the first year). At a 3% discount rate, thecatch-up program would cost society $532,000/case averted, million/death prevented, $138,000/LYS, and $64,000/ QALY saved. A 20% reduction in herd immunity effects wouldincrease the cost per LYS by $21,000; a $30 decrease in the cost of vaccination would decrease the cost per LYS by $55,000. On the basis of the assumption that herd immunitycan be generated, targeting only those U.S. counties in which the disease is highly endemic would decrease the cost per LYS by two thirds. Catch-up vaccination of adolescents can have a substantial impact on disease burden and costs. However, these data dem-onstrate that catch-up and routine vaccination programs withMCV4 among adolescents are more costly per health out- come than existing vaccination strategies for Hib and S. pneumoniae (104,105 ). Compared with routine vaccina- tion of children aged 11 years, catch-up vaccination could cost up to 20% more/LYS. Recommendations for Use of Meningococcal Vaccines Routine Vaccination of Adolescents ACIP recommends routine vaccination of young adoles- cents (defined in this report as persons aged 11-12 years) withMCV4 at the preadolescent health-care visit (i.e., a visit to a health-care provider at age 11-12 years, at which time ACIPand other professional organizations [e.g., AAP and the Ameri- can Medical Association] recommend that persons aged 11-12 years receive appropriate vaccinations and other preventiveservices [ 106-109 ]). Introducing a recommendation for MCV4 vaccination among persons aged 11-12 years mightstrengthen the role of the preadolescent health-care visit andhave a positive effect on vaccine coverage during adolescence. For those adolescents who have not previously received MCV4, ACIP recommends vaccination before high school entry (atapproximately age 15 years) as an effective strategy to reduce meningococcal disease incidence among adolescents and young adults. By 2008, the goal will be routine vaccination withMCV4 of all adolescents beginning at age 11 years. Other adolescents who wish to decrease their risk for meningococcal disease may elect to receive vaccine.Other Populations at Increased Risk for Meningococcal Disease Routine vaccination also is recommended for certain per- sons who have increased risk for meningococcal disease (Table 6). Use of MCV4 is preferred among persons aged 11-55 years; however, use of MPSV4 is recommended among children aged 2-10 years and persons aged >55 years. If MCV4is unavailable, MPSV4 is an acceptable alternative for persons aged 11-55 years. The following populations are at increased risk for menin- gococcal disease: \u007f college freshmen living in dormitories ( 29,30 ); \u007f microbiologists who are routinely exposed to N. meningitdis (110); \u007f military recruits ( 111); \u007f persons who travel to or reside in countries in which N. meningitdis is hyperendemic or epidemic, particularly if contact with the local population will be prolonged (112); \u007f persons who have terminal complement component deficiencies ( 15,16,113 ); and \u007f persons who have anatomic or functional asplenia ( 17). Because of feasibility constraints in targeting freshmen in dormitories, colleges can elect to target their vaccination cam-paigns to all matriculating freshmen. The risk for meningo- coccal disease among nonfreshmen college students is similar to that for the general population of similar age (age 18-24years) ( 29). However, the vaccines are safe and immunogenic and therefore can be provided to nonfreshmen collegestudents who want to reduce their risk for meningococcaldisease. For travelers, vaccination is especially recommended to those visiting the parts of sub-Saharan Africa known as the \"menin-gitis belt\" ( 112) during the dry season (December-June). Vac- cination is required by the government of Saudi Arabia for alltravelers to Mecca during the annual Hajj. Advisories for trav-elers to other countries will be issued when epidemics of men- ingococcal disease caused by vaccine-preventable serogroups are detected. T ravelers' health information is available fromCDC at 877-FYI-TRIP (toll-free) or at http://www.cdc.gov/ travel. Further information concerning geographic areas for which vaccination is recommended can be obtained from in-ternational health clinics for travelers and state health depart- ments. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are likely at increased risk for meningococcal disease, althoughnot to the extent that they are at risk for invasive S. pneumoniae infection ( 20,114 ). Although the efficacy of HIV-infected patients is unknown, HIV-infected patients may14 MMWR May 27, 2005 elect vaccination. For persons aged 11-55 years who have been previously vaccinated with MPSV4, revaccination with MCV4 is not indicated unless vaccination occurred 3-5 years previ- ously and the person still remains at increased risk for menin-gococcal disease (see Revaccination). Adults Aged 20-55 Years MCV4 is licensed for use among adults aged 20-55 years. It is safe, immunogenic ( 97,98,115,116 ), and likely to pro- vide relatively long-lasting protection against meningococcal disease caused by serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135. The rates of meningococcal disease are low in this age group, and vacci-nation will decrease but not eliminate risk. Therefore, routine vaccination is not recommended; however, persons who wish to decrease their risk for meningococcal disease may elect tobe vaccinated. Children Aged <11 Years and Adults Aged >55 Years MCV 4 is not licensed for use among children aged <11 years or adults aged >55 years. Routine vaccination with MPSV4 is not recommended for children aged <2 years because it is rela- tively ineffective and offers a short duration of protection. Routine vaccination with MPSV4 is not recommended forchildren aged 2-10 years and adults aged >55 years who are not identified as being at increased risk for meningococcal disease.Outbreaks of Meningococcal Disease Both MPSV4 ( 4) and MCV4 are recommended for use in control of meningococcal outbreaks caused by vaccine- preventable serogroups (A, C, W-135, and Y) of N. meningitdis . An outbreak is defined by the occurrence of at least three\u00a7 confirmed or probable primary\u00b6 cases of serogroup C meningococcal disease in <3 months, with a resulting pri- mary attack rate of >10 cases/100,000 population. For calcu- lation of this threshold, population-based rates are used ratherthan age-specific attack rates. These recommendations are based on experience with serogroup C meningococcal out-breaks, but these principles might be applicable to outbreaks caused by the other vaccine-preventable meningococcal serogroups, including Y, W-135, and A. Both MCV4 andMPSV4 can be used for outbreak control, although use ofTABLE 6. Recommendations for the use of meningococcal vaccines among persons not vaccinated previously Age group (yrs) Population group <2 2-10 11-19 20-55 >55 General population Not recommended Not recommended A single dose of MCV4* is Not recommended Not recommended recommended at age 11-12 years (at preadolescentassessment visit) or at highschool entry (at approximatelyage 15 years) Groups at increased risk Not usually A single dose A single dose of MCV4 is A single dose of A single dose College freshmen living in dormitories recommended of MPSV4 preferred (MPSV4 is MCV4 is preferred of MPSV4 Certain travelers\u00a7 an acceptable alternative) (MPSV4 is an Certain microbiologists\u00b6acceptable Certain populations experiencing alternative) outbreaks of meningococcal disease** Military recruits Persons with increased susceptibility * Meningococcal conjugate vaccine. Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) (2 doses, 3 months apart) can be considered for children aged 3-18 months to elici t short-term protection against serogroup A disease (a single dose should be considered for children aged 19-23 months). \u00a7Persons who travel to or in areas where Neisseria meningitidis is hyperendemic or epidemic are at increased risk of exposure, particularly if contact with the local population will be prolonged. Vaccination is especially recommended to those visiting the \"meningitis belt\" of sub-Sahara h Africa during the dry season (December-June), and vaccination is required by the government of Saudi Arabia for all travelers to Mecca during the annual Haj j. Advisories for travelers are available at http://www.cdc.gov/travel/outbreaks.htm, http://www.cdc.gov/travel, or by calling CDC's Travelers' Health Hotl ine at 877-FYI-TRIP (toll-free). \u00b6Microbiologists who are routinely exposed to isolates of N. meningitidis should be vaccinated. ** The use of vaccination in outbreak settings has been described previously ( Source: CDC. Control and prevention of meningococcal disease, and Control and prevention of serogroup C meningococcal disease: evaluation and management of suspected outbreaks: recommendations of the A dvisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP]. MMWR 1997;46 [No. RR-5]:13-21). Includes persons who have terminal complement component deficiencies and persons with anatomic or functional asplenia. \u00a7Calculation of attack rates for organization-based outbreaks is most useful for sizable organizations (e.g., certain universities). However, for the majority of organization-based outbreaks with three cases of disease, the rate will be >10 cases/100,000 population. Thus, occurrence of three cases in thesesettings should prompt consideration of vaccination. In certain situations, public health officials also might consider vaccination after only two primary cases are identified. \u00b6To calculate a primary attack rate, sum all confirmed cases; exclude secondary cases, and count each set of co-primary cases as one case. A primary case is one that occurs in the absence of previous known close contact with anotherpatient. A secondary case is one that occurs among close contacts of a primary patient >24 hours after onset of illness in the primary patient. If two or more cases occur among a group of close contacts with onset of illness separated by <24 hours, these cases are considered to be co-primary.Vol. 54 / RR-7 Recommendations and Reports 15 MCV4 is preferred if the population targeted for vaccination includes age groups for which MCV4 is licensed. Detailedrecommendations on evaluation and management of suspected outbreaks of meningococcal disease have been published pre- viously ( 4). Administration For persons aged 11-55 years, MCV4 is administered intramuscularly as a single 0.5-mL dose. MPSV4 is adminis-tered subcutaneously as a single 0.5-mL dose to persons aged>2 years. MCV4 and MPSV4 can be administered concomi- tantly with other vaccines, but at a different anatomic site (4,117 ). Protective levels of antibodies are usually achieved within 7-10 days of vaccination ( 60,118 ). Revaccination Revaccination might be indicated for persons previously vaccinated with MPSV4 who remain at increased risk forinfection (e.g., persons residing in areas in which disease is epidemic), particularly children who were first vaccinated at age <4 years. Such children should be considered for revacci-nation after 2-3 years if they remain at increased risk. Although the need for revaccination among adults and older children after receiving MPSV4 has not been determined, antibody levels decline rapidly after 2-3 years, and, if indica- tions still exist for vaccination, revaccination might be con-sidered after 5** years ( 4). Repeated vaccination with serogroup polysaccharide vaccine might induceimmunologic hyporesponsiveness ( 56-59 ), although clinical of are not known. Hyporesponsiveness to serogroup C polysaccharide can be overcome by vaccination with serogroup C conjugate vaccine(119,120 ). MCV4 11-55 years; however, use of MSPV4 is acceptable. ACIP expects that MCV4 will provide longer protection than MPSV4; however, studies are needed to confirm this assumption ( 87). More data will likely become available within the next 5 years to guide recommendations on revaccination for persons who were previously vaccinated with MCV4. Precautions and Contraindications Recommended vaccinations can be administered to persons with minor acute illness (e.g., diarrhea or mild upper-respiratory tract infection with or without fever) ( 117). Vac- cination should be deferred for persons with moderate or severeacute illness until the person's condition improves. Vaccina-tion with MCV4 or MPSV4 is contraindicated amongpersons known to have a severe allergic reaction to any com-ponent of the vaccine, including dipththeria toxoid (forMCV4), or to dry natural rubber latex. Any adverse effect suspected to be associated with MCV4 or MPSV4 vaccine should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event ReportingSystem (VAERS). More information about VAERS is avail- able at 800-822-7967 (toll-free) or from http://www.vaers.org. Because both MCV4 and MPSV4 are inactivated vaccines, they may be administered to persons who are immunosup-pressed as a result of disease or medications; however, response to the vaccine might be less than optimal ( 117). Studies of vaccination with MPSV4 during pregnancy have not documented adverse effects among either pregnant womenor newborns ( 121-123 ). On the basis of these data, preg- nancy should not preclude vaccination with MPSV4, if indi- cated. MCV4 is safe and immunogenic among nonpregnant persons aged 11-55 years, but no data are available on thesafety of MCV4 during pregnancy. Women of childbearing age who become aware that they were pregnant at the time of MCV4 vaccination should contact their health-care provideror the vaccine manufacturer. Future Meningococcal Vaccines, Areas for Research, and Public Education MCV4 has been licensed on the basis of data regarding safety and short-term immunogenicity. Postmarketing studies are planned ( 98), including a study to evaluate the duration of the antibody response among participants who had received a single dose of MCV4 vaccine or MPSV4 vaccine 5 and 10 years earlier and a study to evaluate safety and immunogenic- ity when MCV4 is given concomitantly with tetanus andreduced diphtheria and acellular pertussis vaccine adsorbed (Tdap). However, immunogenicity data alone are insufficient to predict vaccine effectiveness and herd immunity effect,which depends largely on the ability of vaccine to alter trans- mission patterns. Additional studies are needed to evaluate vaccine effectiveness, vaccine impact on nasopharyngealcarriage of meningococci, and indirect effects of vaccine on disease rates among unvaccinated populations. Meningococcal conjugate vaccines might be considered for licensing in the United States among persons in other agegroups, including infants and children aged <10 years ( 98). These vaccines are undergoing clinical trials and are likely to have better immunogenicity among infants and young chil- dren than MPSV4 ( 124-126 ), which is the only vaccine avail- able for these age groups in the United States. Information on vaccine effectiveness, duration of protection, and herd ** Certain sources recommend revaccination after 3 years ( 4).16 MMWR May 27, 2005 immunity obtained from MCV4 evaluation studies will be valuable in guiding prevention policies and formulating rec-ommendations for vaccination of persons in other age groups. Because serogroup B capsular polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans, vaccine development for serogroupB meningococci have focused on common proteins, includ- ing the outer membrane proteins (OMP) of specific epidemic strains. Efficacy of OMP vaccines has been demonstratedamong older children and adults but not among infants and young children, in whom rates of disease are highest (127-130 ). In addition, the variability in OMP strains caus- ing endemic disease will likely limit their usefulness in the United States ( 131,132 ). Because of the potential limitations of these vaccines, other new approaches to serogroup B vaccines are being pursued,including the conjugation of a modified serogroup B polysaccharide (after substitution of the N-acetyl group withan group) to a recombinant serogroup B menin- gococcal porin protein. Although this vaccine is immunogenic in mice and nonhuman primates, concern exists that the vac-cine might not be safe ( 132). In addition, with the recent sequencing of the serogroup B meningococcal genome, newgenes encoding putative membrane proteins have been iden-tified, targets for serogroup B vac- 133-135 ). The availability of new meningococcal conjugate vaccines and the development of new vaccine strat-egies should lead to substantial improvements in global control and prevention of meningococcal disease. Although the signs and symptoms of meningococcal dis- ease are frequently nonspecific, increasing awareness for men-ingococcal disease can result in earlier medical care-seekingbehavior and improved clinical outcomes. In addition, edu- cating adolescents and their parents about the benefits of receiving MCV4 is key to preventing a substantial number ofcases of meningococcal disease. Finally, educating policy mak- ers and the general public about the benefits of receivingMCV4 vaccine might improve vaccination coverage rates and substantially decrease the burden of meningococcal disease inthe United States. Antimicrobial Chemoprophylaxis In the United States, the primary means for prevention of sporadic meningococcal disease is antimicrobial chemopro- phylaxis of close contacts of a patient with invasive meningo- coccal disease (Table 7). Close contacts include 1) ), 2) child-care center contacts ( 3) anyone directly exposed to secretions(e.g., through kissing, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, chemoprophylaxis should be consid- ered for any passenger who had direct contact with respira-tory secretions from an index-patient or for anyone seated directly next to an index-patient on a prolonged flight (i.e., one lasting >8 hours). Guidelines for chemoprophylaxis of travelers have been published previously ( 139). The attack rate for household contacts exposed to patients who have sporadicmeningococcal disease was estimated to be four cases/1,000persons exposed, which is 500-800 times greater than the rate for the total population ( 137). In the United Kingdom, the attack rate among health-care workers exposed to patients withmeningococcal disease was determined to be 25 times higher than among the general population ( 140). Because the rate of secondary disease for close contacts is highest immediately after onset of disease in the index patient,antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis should be administered assoon as possible (ideally <24 hours after identification of the index patient). Conversely, chemoprophylaxis administered>14 days after onset of illness in the index patient is probablyof limited or no value. Oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal cul- tures are not helpful in determining the need for chemopro- phylaxis and might unnecessarily delay institution of thispreventive measure. TABLE 7. Schedule for administering chemoprophylaxis against meningococcal disease Duration and route Drug Age group Dosage of administration* RifampinChildren aged <1 mo 5 mg/kg body weight every 12 hrs 2 days Children aged >1 mo 10 mg/kg body weight every 12 hrs 2 days Adults 600 mg every 12 hrs 2 days Ciprofloxacin\u00a7Adults 500 mg Single dose Ceftriaxone Children aged <15 yrs 125 mg Single IM\u00b6 dose Ceftriaxone Adults 250 mg Single IM dose * Oral administration unless indicated otherwise. Not recommended for pregnant women because it is teratogenic in laboratory animals. Because the reliability of oral contracepti ves might be affected by rifampin therapy, consideration should be given to using alternative contraceptive measures while rifampin is being administere d. \u00a7Not usually recommended for persons aged <18 years or for pregnant and lactating women because it causes cartilage damage in im mature laboratory animals. Can be used for chemoprophylaxis of children when no acceptable alternative therapy is available. Recent literature re view identified no reports of irreversible cartilage toxicity or age-associated adverse events among children and adolescents ( Berman SM, Blumer the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea infection in adolescents: does the benefit outweigh the risk? Clin I nfect Dis 2002;35:S191-9). \u00b6Intramuscular.Vol. 54 Reports 17 Rifampin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone are 90%-95% effective in reducing nasopharyngeal carriage of N. meningitdis and are all acceptable antimicrobial agents for agents other than ceftriaxone or other third-generation cephalosporins might not reliably eradicate nasopharyngeal carriage of N. meningitdis . If other agents have been used for treatment, the index patient should receive chemoprophylactic antibiotics for eradication of nasopharyn- geal carriage before being discharged from the hospital ( 145). One recent study has reported that a single 500-mg oral dose of azithromycin was effective in eradicating nasopharyn-geal carriage of N. meningitdis (146). Azithromycin, in addi- tion to being safe and easy to administer, is also available in a suspension form and is approved for use among children. Further evaluation is warranted of both the effectiveness of azithromycin in eradicating carriage of N. meningitdis and potential for development of microbial resistance to this drug if it is widely used for chemoprophylaxis.
