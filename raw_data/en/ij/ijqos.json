Pictured is Melissa Wakeling who said vaccines 'are destroying the health of so many children' Homeopaths are preying on parents' fears about childhood injections to sell them 'kits' of ineffective pills costing up to \u00a3250. A Daily Mail investigation today reveals how some practitioners are spreading myths about vaccines to convince people to forgo life-saving jabs against the likes of measles and meningitis. Some claim the pills offer protection against all the infectious diseases covered by [NHS](/news/nhs/index.html) vaccines. An undercover reporter, posing as the mother of a ten-month-old baby, approached three homeopaths who sell remedies they claim boost 'natural immunity'. All three promoted them as an 'effective and safe' alternative to vaccinations - which are proven to be clinically effective at protecting against diseases including measles, mumps, rubella and meningitis. They used consultations to push a slew of false claims about vaccinations, including wholly discredited research linking the MMR jab to autism. One London-based homeopath, Saqib Rashid, accused GPs of 'lying' to parents and said they are 'taking children as guinea pigs'. Another, Sally Lloyd, linked vaccines to diabetes and cancer and devised a 'homeopathic preventative programme' to protect from measles, mumps and rubella. A third, Melissa Wakeling, said vaccines 'are destroying the health of so many children' and that homeopathy offers a 'viable scientific alternative'. Another, Sally Lloyd (right), linked vaccines to diabetes and cancer and devised a 'homeopathic preventative programme' to protect from measles, mumps and rubella. A third, Saqib Rashid (left), accused GPs of 'lying' to parents and said they are 'taking children as guinea pigs' Three weeks ago the Mail launched a campaign to improve the uptake of childhood vaccinations amid rising cases of measles and mumps. There is growing concern about the role of some homeopaths in the anti-vaccine movement - with the head of NHS England warning 'chancers' are conning the public to part with 'hard-earned cash in return for bogus treatments'. Experts said the findings of our investigation show their 'worst fears' about some homeopaths spreading anti-vaxx myths are true. Three weeks ago the Mail launched a campaign to improve the uptake of childhood vaccinations amid rising cases of measles and mumps. Stock picture Our reporter posed as a mother who was concerned about giving their baby son the MMR jab, which is given when children turn one. She approached three homeopaths who offer programmes of homeoprophylaxis, which involves administering tiny doses of diseased tissue called 'nosodes' in pill form. Mr Rashid sells a full 'kit' for \u00a3250 which he claimed will 'cover all infectious diseases for which NHS is providing protection'. During a 30-minute consultation he linked vaccines to a 'spectrum of diseases' including autism, asthma and Alzheimer's. Mrs Lloyd, based in Stoke-on-Trent, charged \u00a395 for a consultation and homeopathic 'preventative programme'. She claimed '60 to 70 per cent of autism cases' in her clients are linked to vaccines. Miss Wakeling, who lives in south-west London, said homeopathy provides an alternative to vaccines which can lead to 'toxic overload' in children's brains. She charges parents \u00a389 for a 'kit' from the US, and an additional \u00a3150 to supervise the programme. The bogus link between MMR and autism quoted by all three is based on now-discredited 1998 research by disgraced doctor Andrew Wakefield. Michael Marshall, from the scientific charity the Good Thinking Society, said the Mail's findings were 'incredibly worrying'. He added: 'We've always had a concern that homeopaths are going beyond what they say publicly on their websites. Ruth May, NHS England chief nurse, said: 'Vaccines are a vital, life-saving part of our country's health'. Stock picture 'The Daily Mail has demonstrated that our worst fears are absolutely true.' Ruth May, NHS England chief nurse, said: 'Vaccines are a vital, life-saving part of our country's health, and the suggestion homeopathic vaccines offer people anything other than a costly waste of time, money and effort is a myth with deadly consequences.' When the Mail approached Miss Lloyd last night, she said: 'I stand by what I said.' Miss Wakeling said she is bound by the Free and Healthy Children International ethics code, adding: 'I do not advertise homeoprophylaxis or impose it on patients.' Mr Rashid did not respond to requests for comment.
