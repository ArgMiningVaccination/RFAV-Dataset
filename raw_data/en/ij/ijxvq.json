Purpose: the purpose of this study is to demonstrate that patients with tachycardia can have chakras' energy deficiencies as the root and the corrections of these imbalances through Chinese medicine's tools and replenishment of the chakras' energies centers using highly diluted medications are very important to correct the root of the cause and not just treating the symptoms. Method: two case reports. The first is a 45-years-old male patient who came to me after suffering from tachycardia during the last 12 years due to panic syndrome. He had tachycardia crises when his blood pressure increased, his heart accelerated and he thought he was having a heart attack or something like that, so he ran to the emergency room where tests and prescriptions were made only to lower blood pressure and all his tests were shown normal. The second case report is a 44 years-old female patient with tachycardia symptoms ( heart beat more then 100 bpm ). It was prescribed to her beta-blockers by her cardiologist and it works only in the begining and she stopped to use this medication. Both patients did the chakras' energy centers measurement, and all the chakras of both patients were completely deficient in energy, rated one out eight. Both patients received Chinese dietary counselling, auricular acupuncture with apex ear bloodletting and replenishment of the chakras' energy centers with homeopathy medications according to the theory Constitutional Homeopathy of the Five Elements based on Traditional Chinese Medicine and also using Mercurius solubilis 200CH and Aconitum 6CH and crystal-based medications. Result: Both patients improved with the treatment done (without the necessity of using the other Western medications). Conclusion: the conclusion of this study is that patients with tachycardia could have energy deficiency in the chakras' energy centers, that could lead to the formation of internal Heat and the correction of these energy' imbalances replenishing these lack of energy using highly diluted medications such as homeopathy according to the theory Constitutional Homeopathy of the Five Elements Based on Traditional Chinese Medicine is the major importance to cure the disease in the root and not just treating the symptoms. Introduction Tachycardia is defined as an atrial and/or ventricular rate of more than 100 beats per minute (bpm). Sinus tachycardia (heart rate >100 bpm) is the form encountered most commonly in clinical practice. The vast majority of sinus tachycardia is physiological and associated with catecholaminergic triggers (e.g., emotions physical activity, and other stresses) [1]. Cardiac arrhythmia is a serious and common diseases and are related to abnormal heart pulse frequen - cy, conduction velocity, rhythm, origin site, excited order. Cardiac arrhythmias include sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, ventricu - lar premature beat, paroxysmal supra-ventricular tachycardia, etc [2, 3]. According to the study written by Li, et al. (2017) entitled Com - parative Effectiveness of Acupuncture and Antiarrhythmic Drugs for the Prevention of Cardiac Arrhythmias: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials, clinical treatments for this condition include drug therapy, radiofrequency catheter ablation, surgical intervention. But all drugs recommended for this treatment has their side effects and may cause gastro- intestinal symptoms, hypotension, among other negative effects [3]. Recently, there are clinical observations that acupuncture can be effective in cardiac arrhythmias through diverse mechanisms and has the ad - vantage of being safe, inexpensive, few adverse reactions, simple This work is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License OJCRR.MS.ID.000634.

According to the article written by CHEN Wei-guo and BA Zhuo- ma (2010) entitled Prof. ZHANG Yi's Experience in Treating Severe Arrhythmia , tachycardia in traditional Chinese medicine is caused by Liver depression with interior Heat [4]. Purpose The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that patients with tachycardia can have energy deficiency in the chakras' energy cen - ters that is leading to the formation of internal Heat, and the treat - ment of this condition is important to treat the cause of the tachy - cardia and not just treating the symptoms itself. Method It was done an extensive search in Western and in tradition - al Chinese medicine publications indexed in PubMed concerning articles related to tachycardia and arrhythmias. It was also used to write this article two cases that I treated in my clinic in Brazil, of patients in treatment for another clinical problem but also had tachycardia symptoms. Case Report 1 The first case report is a 45-years-old male patient who came to me after suffering from tachycardia during the last 12 years due to panic syndrome. In his past history, he had tachycardia crises where his blood pressure increased, his heart accelerated and he thought he was having a heart attack or something like that, so he ran to the emergency room where tests and prescriptions were made only to lower blood pressure and all his tests were shown normal. These crises were spaced out. In one of the trips to the emergency room due to palpitations, after verifying that everything was normal, the doctor advised the patient to see a psychologist. The psychologist prescribed floral medicines that helped a little for a few months. However, after a while, the crises returned, and he started to under -go treatment with a psychiatrist who prescribed medicines that the patient has been using for 10 years. The medications used at this time was: 6 pills of Alprazolam 1 mg- 2 tablets 3x per day; Proximax 20 mg- 1 tablet at lunch; 30 drops of Clonazepam (10 drops 3x per day). Even with psychiatric follow-up, sometimes there were tachy - cardia attacks, so he went to the emergency room and 20 drops of Clonazepan were prescribed to him. Although with these medica - tions he did not have any more crises, he knew that he could not continue using them for a long time, because he could not do any - thing else, he was very sleepy, he could not drive anymore, he had no more social life. That's why he came to me. His Chinese medicine diagnosis was Kidney Yin deficiency and Heat retention. The first step in his treatment was to orientate him the foods that he needs to use or avoid through the Chinese dietary counseling. I recom - mend to him to avoid all dairy products, raw foods, Cold drinks, and sweets (to not imbalance the Spleen and pancreas energy merid - ian). I also recommend him to avoid fried foods, eggs, chocolate, honey, coconut, alcoholic beverages, and melted cheese (to do not imbalance the Liver and Gall bladder energy centers and do more formation of internal Heat). The last group of foods I suggest avoid - ing is coffee, soft drinks, and mate tea, (to do not cause Kidney en - ergy deficiency). He also received systemic and auricular acupuncture with apex ear bloodletting (Figure 1). In the first 3 weeks of treatments, he went to the acupuncture session every day, and after, he went three times per week. I also measured his chakras' energy centers using a crystal pendulum through the radiesthesia procedure. It showed that all the five internal massive organs (Liver, Heart, Spleen, Lung and Kidney) and the memory and concentration (sixth chakra) were in the minimum level of energy (rated one out of eight), as I am demonstrating in the (Figure 2). Figure 1: The auricular acupuncture points used in the treatment of case report one. Citation: Huang Wei Ling. Energy Imbalances and Chakras' Energy Deficiencies as One of the Cause of Tachycardia.

Reports Volume 6-Issue 2Page 3 of 10So, I prescribe the homeopathies medications according to the theory written by me (2020) entitled Constitutional Homeopathy of the Five Elements based on Traditional Chinese Medicine and also crystal-based medications, as you can see in the (Table 1). The med - ications prescribed needs to intake according to the generation cy - cle of the five elements, as you can see in the (Figure 3). Figure 2: Result of the measurement of the chakras' energy centers of the case report one, using radiesthesia procedure. Results of the case report 1 With the treatment done, the patient was able to reduce the intake of highly concentrated medications (that was reducing his vital energy and causing more formation of internal Heat, that were causing more tachycardia symptoms). He started taking only 3 pills of tranquilizer (1 pill 3x a day) and gradually removed the Clonaze - pam, decreasing the drops per day for a month until it was over. He stopped acupuncture sessions for a while (because of the COVID-19 pandemic), but now he's back (November 2021) so he can finish taking out the highly concentrated medications, that was harming his vital energy and leading to more formation of internal Heat (that was causing the tachycardia symptoms). Since he started treatment according to TCM, he has not had more tachycardia attacks, he feels better, more energized to his daily activities and was very thankful for all the results in his treatment. Case Report 2 The second case report was a 44-years-old female patient, who always had her heart beating close to 100 bpm or more, but since March 2020 she felt she had intensified, her heart was always pounding. She went to a cardiologist who prescribed the drug pro - pranolol and at first, the medication was helping her, improving her tachycardia, and reducing her heartbeat, but after a while, it stopped working and she stopped taking it. She noticed that the tachycardia worsened with the proximity of the menstruation, when eating melted cheese, chocolate, coffee, with anger, fear, anxi - ety could increase the heartbeat always. And it could happen at any time of the day, she had days when she woke up feeling the irregular beats, sometimes she felt it in the late afternoon and sometimes she felt it when she went to bed to sleep at night. Her Chinese medicine's diagnosis was Kidney Yang deficiency, Blood deficiency and Heat retention. So, I started the treatment, us - ing the same tools used in the first case report, using the Chinese dietary counseling, systemic and auricular acupuncture with apex ear bloodletting. I also prescribe to her the homeopathic Aconitum napellus 6 CH (diluted in apple vinegar) 5 drops three times per day. I also measured her chakras' energies centers through the radi - esthesia procedure that showed that all her chakras' energy centers were in the minimum level of energy (rated in one out of eight), with the exception of the seventh chakra that was normal, rated in eight. So, I prescribe the same homeopathic medications used in the case report one, according to Constitutional Homeopathy of the Five Elements based on Traditional Chinese Medicine , described in the (Table 1).

Discussion This study will be written by the influences of Hippocrates (460 bce - 375 bce), father of medicine, that said that \"it is far more im - portant to use oldest medicine prior to the current medicine used nowadays\". So, in this article, I will use reasoning used by tradition - al Chinese medicine, together with the teachings to great names in the history of medicine, such as Galen (ca. 129 ca. 217), who exert the most influences in the type of medicine practiced nowadays [5]. To understand how I did all my reasoning in the treatment of all my patients, I will briefly tell you the history of one specific patient that was the cornerstone of all my treatments nowadays. This patient was a 70-year-old male, that I treated in 2006, who was complain - ing pain in the legs for the last 6 months without improvement us - ing anti-inflammatory medications. He went to my clinic to search for another type of treatment and I his diagnosis in traditional Chi -nese medicine was Kidney- Yang deficiency (because he was felling colder in the lower limbs). The treatment prescribed to him was Chinese dietary counseling (the same orientation reported in the case one of this article), auricular acupuncture and systemic acu - puncture associated with apex ear bloodletting, to treat this leg pain symptoms, according to his energy imbalance [6]. The patient presented an improvement of his leg pain after 10 acupuncture sessions and went back to the clinic to be evaluated again. On this occasion, he revealed to me that he also had a major improvement in a symptom I was not aware he had. He has been treating for glaucoma for the past 40 years, with no significant im - provement of his intra-ocular pressure, always above 40 mmHg. For the first time of his life, his intraocular pressure reduced from 40 to 17mmHg. The treatment for Kidney- Yang deficiency not only improved his leg pain symptoms but also improved his intraocular pressure [6]. For you to better understand why the treatment fo - cused on the symptoms sometimes cannot succeed, I would like to show you this metaphor of the tree (Figure 4), that I always use in my presentations and in all articles wrote by me [5, 6]. Figure 3: Generation cycle of the Five Elements theory. This tree has a trunk with several branches, as you can see in the (Figure 4). From each branch, you can see many leaves. These leaves represent the symptoms and diseases treated by each branch (that represents one medical specialty). These are the focus of Western medicine, the part above the earth and visible by the naked eyes. But this tree has a part below the earth, invisible by the naked eyes that is the root. This root is the focus of traditional Chinese medicine because they understand that all the symptoms presented by each patient (in the leaf level), is caused by energy imbalances in the root level, that we cannot see by the naked eyes, and also, by the influences of the external pathogenic factors, that are surrounding this tree (Cold, Wind, Humidity, Dryness and Heat) [5, 6]. The Yin and Yang theory is the main cornerstone used in tra - ditional Chinese medicine and I use the balance between these two energies in all treatments nowadays. These energies are opposites but complementary. I can show the Yin and Yang when we compare different things such as man and women, day and night, summer, and winter, etc. [7].Citation: Huang Wei Ling. Energy Imbalances and Chakras' Energy Deficiencies as One of the Cause of Tachycardia. On J Cardio Res & Rep. 6(2): 2021. OJCRR.MS.ID.000634. DOI: 10.33552/OJCRR.2021.06.000634 . Reports Volume 6-Issue 2Page 5 of 10Figure 4: The tree metaphor, showing the different viewpoints between Western and traditional Chinese medicine. According to Chinese wise men, everything in the world is ruled by the \"measure of balance\" understood as Yin and Yang . Every - thing is cyclical, and there are always principals of opposites com - plementing themselves in the universe [5]. To Yin and Yang flow in - side the meridians, there is the necessity of having other two other energies that is Qi and Blood, as you can see in the (Figure 5) [7]. Qi is the energy that invigorates Blood to keep it circulating through - out the body. Blood and Qi have a very important relationship and are mutually dependent, Qi prevents Blood stagnation, and Blood nourishes Qi, as you can see in the (Figure 5) [7]. Figure 5: Yin, Yang, Qi and Blood. The internal Heat is an energy imbalance, generated by defi - ciency of one of Yin, Yang , Qi and Blood energies or a combination of imbalances of these energies, as you can see in the (Figure 6). It is these energy imbalances that is generating the tachycardia symptoms, because as I showed to you, both patients were very de - ficient in energy in all chakras' energy centers, that are responsible for the production of Yin, Yang , Qi and Blood energy. Yin and Yang are produced by Kidney (second chakra) and Blood is produced by the Spleen (fifth chakra). The Heart (third chakra) is responsible for controlling the Blood flow inside the blood vessels. The Liver (first chakra) and the Lungs (fourth chakra) are responsible for the distribution of Qi in the entire body. The lack of energy can generate another energy imbalance, that is the formation of internal Heat, that is responsible for the tachycardia symptoms. Usually, these Heat is localized in the Liver and in the Gallbladder meridian, that is the organ that sends energy to the Heart. If the Liver and Gall - bladder is imbalanced, these energy alterations can be sent to the Heart (Figure 3), causing tachycardia manifestations and usually cannot identify the cause of this manifestation, because they are all in the root level, in the energy imbalances, that we cannot see by the naked eyes [8]. Internal Heat can also be caused by excessive anger, as the ex - cessive anger leads to an increase of the Liver- Yang , that as told in the begging of the presentation, leading to formation of internal Heat (Figure 7) also, and can could cause the tachycardia symptoms Online Journal of Cardiology Research & Reports Volume 6-Issue 2Citation: Huang Wei Ling. Energy Imbalances and Chakras' Energy Deficiencies as One of the Cause of Tachycardia. On J Cardio Res & Rep. 6(2): 2021. OJCRR.MS.ID.000634. DOI: 10.33552/OJCRR.2021.06.000634 .Page 6 of 10[8]. The Five Elements theory states that there are five elements present in everything in the world, including our body. These el - ements are Fire, Earth, Metal, Water and Wood. Inside our bodies, specific organs will represent these elements. These organs are considered the main organs, and they have extremely important functions in the well-functioning of the body. They are completely interconnected, as the main principle of the Five Elements theory is to understand the idea of cycle, that I will show you in the (Figure 7) [9]. Figure 6: Internal Heat formation due to energy deficiency. Figure 7: Five Elements Theory. The first cycle of the Five Elements Theory is \"The Generating Cycle\" (Figure 8). In this cycle, each element serves as a \"mother,\" which promotes the growth and development of a \"child\" element. Each element provides a generating force for the element that fol - lows. Wood easily burns and makes a Fire. Fire produces ash, cre - ating Earth. The Earth contains mineral from which Metal is mined and extracted. When Metal is heated and cooled, Water drops will be found over the metal as a result of condensation. Thus, Metal cre - ates Water. Water promotes the growth of trees, which are Wood. The cycle continually gives rise to change and transformation. In this case, both patients were without any energy inside all internal massive organs and for this reason, the patient will not have condi -tion to produce energy necessary for maintenance of life. For this reason, due to energy deficiency condition, the body begin to pro - duce Heat, that can be seeing in this case as tachycardia but could cause another clinical manifestation such as dry mouth, bad breath, bleeding gums, itchiness in the skin, anxiety, panic syndrome, schizophrenia, infections, acne, psoriasis, insomnia, diabetes, hy - pertension, cancer, etc ... [5-8]. In traditional Chinese medicine, many diseases can come from the same energy imbalances, as I showed in the article Energy Al - terations and Chakras' Energy Deficiencies and Propensity to SARS- CoV-2 Infection . But the same diseases can come from different en - ergy imbalances also [10]. Secondly, there is the \"The Control Cycle\" Citation: Huang Wei Ling. Energy Imbalances and Chakras' Energy Deficiencies as One of the Cause of Tachycardia. On J Cardio Res & Rep. 6(2): 2021. OJCRR.MS.ID.000634. DOI: 10.33552/OJCRR.2021.06.000634 . Reports Volume 6-Issue 2Page 7 of 10(Figure 9). The part of this cycle is to prevent any element from be - coming overwhelming or too powerful in relation to the system as a whole. It is called the \"grandmother and grandchild relationship\". The \"grandmother\" element exerts healthy control over the \"grand - child\" element. In this theory, Earth can stop the Water, Water can stop a Fire, Fire can melt Metal, Metal can cut Wood and Wood can consume Earth [9]. According to TCM, emotions also have a signifi - cant part in the body's health. Considering the Five Elements theo - ry, each element is associated to one specific emotion. For example, grief can imbalance the Lung (fourth chakra); Excessive worry can imbalance the Spleen (fifth chakra); Fear can imbalance the Kid - ney (second chakra), Chronic anger can imbalance the Liver (first chakra) and excessive Joy can imbalance the Heart (third chakra). In this article. I am showing that chronic imbalances in the inter - nal massive organs, caused by the emotions (Figure 10), need to be treated to do no harm even more the vital energy, that was already low, leading to the manifestation of symptoms in the leaf level of the tree [11]. Excessive anger, for example, can lead to an increase of the Yang energy of the Liver, leading to internal Heat formation, and as the Liver send energy to the Heart (Figure 11), this excessive production of Heat by the Liver can be transmitted to the Heart, inducing the tachycardia symptoms in the patients, speeding up the Heart beats [8]. Figure 8: Generation cycle. Figure 9: Control cycle. Figure 10: Five Elements and the emotions that can imbalance them.

Both patients were suffering from panic syndrome and accord - ing to TCM, panic syndrome is caused by the formation of Heat in the Gallbladder, which is the organ attached to the Liver, so patients with panic syndrome suffer tachycardia, since the energy of the Gallbladder and Liver are sent to the Heart, causing in this case, the increase Heart beat and causing tachycardia that has 'apparently no reason to occur\", because all the alterations are in the energy level, invisible by the naked eyes [8]. Another important factor that must be considerate and used with precautions is the utilization of highly concentrate medications, because, according to the Arndt-Schultz law, for all substances, small doses stimulate the vital energy, mod - erate doses inhibit the energy and overdoses reduces the vital ener - gy and can be lethal, as described in the (Figure 12) [12]. Figure 12: Arndt-Schultz Law. The choice of using homeopathy and crystal-based medications was based on the idea of strengthening the patient's energy, and in this way reducing the formation of internal Heat and the tachy - cardia symptoms, as demonstrated by the improvement of tachy - cardia symptoms in both patients when I used the rebalancing of the internal energy and replenishing them using highly diluted medications, according to the theory Constitutional Homeopathy of the Five Elements Based on Traditional Chinese Medicine and crys - tal-based medications. The use of homeopathy medications to treat symptoms in the leaf level, such as the use of Aconitum, in this case to reduce the Heat, were indicated to treat the symptoms, but not the cause. For this reason, the indication of homeopathy medica - tions to treat the symptoms should be followed by the indication of homeopathy medications to treat the root, because if we treat the symptoms but still not treat the root, the patient will maintain the condition of being immunosuppressed and not immune competent, as I showed in the article written by me (2021) entitled Why Do Patients Still Have the Potential to Transmit COVID-19 Despite Re - ceiving Vaccinations [9, 13]. The medication that the patients were taking, which is propran - olol to slow the heartbeat, will reduce the vital energy as this drug is considered a highly concentrated medication. This reduction in the vital energy can induce the formation of more internal Heat, and consequently more tachycardia, generating a snowball cycle, as demonstrated in the case report two, that this patient only had im - provement of her tachycardia condition in the beginning of the use of beta-blocker medications and after the chronic use, these kinds of medications induced energy deficiency and cause more forma -Citation: Huang Wei Ling. Energy Imbalances and Chakras' Energy Deficiencies as One of the Cause of Tachycardia. On J Cardio Res & Rep. 6(2): 2021. OJCRR.MS.ID.000634. DOI: 10.33552/OJCRR.2021.06.000634 . Reports Volume 6-Issue 2Page 9 of 10tion of internal Heat, worsening the tachycardia symptoms [5, 7]. It is important to say that homeopathy and acupuncture were rec - ognized by the Federal Council of Medicine in Brazil in 1980 and 1995, respectively and has been joined by a significant contingent of physicians with great experience and already qualified in their specialties of origin [14]. Western medicine is based mainly on Galen's (129 CE- c. 216 CE) studies and he says that the organs work independently, and they do not depend on each other. This type of thoughts is very different from TCM way of thinking, which says that one organ de - pends on the other, as I showed in the generation cycle and con - trol cycle (Figure 8 & 9). Therefore, when a patient goes to a doctor presenting tachycardia, he usually looks at his Heart isolated and unlike the TCM point of view, which sees the whole system and an - alyzes what the whole is causing in the Heart, so we have to have a holistic view, to be able to treat the patient more properly [15].In order to treat patients as a whole and in a more effective way, it is important to comprehend the different parts of the different medical perspectives. The body is not only physical and constituted by organs and tissues. It is also formed by energy as said by Albert Einstein: \"all the things that exists in our universe is composed by energy\" [7]. In this figure, a metaphor of Yin and Yang , the different kinds of medicine were created (Figure 13). Presently, these two perspectives are separated, and they are opposites. However, they can be complementary. Nevertheless, neither one can exist with - out the other. In this metaphor, traditional Chinese medicine can be considered Yang energy and Western medicine, Yin energy. Yang represents the potential energy, and Yin, the energy that is already materialized. Just as with Yin and Yang , traditional Chinese medi - cine starts where Western medicine ends, and vice-versa. This re - lationship is dynamic, not static. Patients would benefit from the balance between these two perspectives, just as the body benefits from the balance of Yin and Yang [5, 7]. Figure 13: Yin and Yang metaphor of Western and traditional Chinese medicine. Conclusion The conclusion of this study is that patients that has tachycar - dia can have energy imbalances in the back ground and causing the formation of internal Heat, that is a kind of Fire, that is leading to increase in the Heart beat and the correction of these energies' im - balances and replenishment of these chakras' energy centers using homeopathy medications according to the theory Constitutional Homeopathy of the Five Elements Based on Traditional Chinese Med - icine and other tools used by traditional Chinese medicine such as Chinese dietary counseling, auricular acupuncture with apex ear bloodletting is of a major importance to cure the disease in the root level (deepest level) and not just in the symptoms (leaf level). More studies in this field needs to be done with more patients to see the results in this treatment using this kind of reasoning. Acknowledgement None.
