Neu WATER's interfaith \"Seasons Series\" developed out of a request from women with cancer for prayers specific to their situation. We expanded the scope to offer spiritual healing resources and journaling techniques to all in need of healing. Then we were asked to include resources for companions who accompany people with cancer and terminal illness. We are called to be compassionate. Inspired by women with cancer and their loved ones who found \"Seasons of Survival\" and \"Seasons of Healing\" beneficial, WATER has created this third collection in our \"Seasons\" series, \"Seasons of Compassion: Resources for Companions of Those Needing Healing.\" This resource is meant to be a resource for those who accompany women dealing with life-threatening illness and/or loss. The fifty-four different cards include prayers to help you open to compassion and act with compassion. They provide you with ways to transition your loved one into new life. They offer you ways to grieve after the loss of a loved one. They help you mark anniversaries and milestones. These resources can help you become better in tune with yourself and those around you on the journey to compassion. (WATERworks Press, 54 pages, "}
