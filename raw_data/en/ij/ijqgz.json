Thus, I feel at home practicing here. Many patients seek the integrative approach I offer, which intuitively makes sense. Conventional medicine has its place, but often stops short of looking at the whole picture. Surgical solutions and pharmaceuticals that address symptoms can sometimes be effective, but in many cases, the root causes of the conditions are not being addressed. Naturopathic doctors are primary care doctors, thoroughly trained in both traditional Western scientific medicine, as well as natural treatment methods. It is this training that thoroughly prepares us to address your health concerns from an integrative perspective. Sometimes more invasive or aggressive treatment methods are needed. At other times, we can achieve optimal treatment outcomes with much gentler, yet still effective methods. Thus, there is a place for both drug and non-drug approaches. Part of my job as a naturopathic doctor is to determine the least invasive, yet effective, treatment for any given condition. Even many natural substances such as herbs can be dangerous in the wrong dose or the wrong patient. Again, as a trained naturopathic doctor, it is my job to guide you towards the safest treatment. One of the core principles of naturopathic medicine is to treat the whole. This principle directs the naturopath to not only look at symptoms or test results, but to dig deeper in order to address the various factors that affect your health or disease processes. These factors includes diet, stress and psychological framework, exercise, sleep, toxic exposures, hormonal balance, digestive function, genetic variations, etc. A naturopathic doctor will endeavor to uncover and remove those factors that are damaging your health, in order to allow the body to repair itself. A naturopathic doctor utilizes clinical and laboratory diagnostic testing, so there is a merging of ancient wisdom and modern medicine. All medical conditions can be treated with naturopathic medicine, including chronic pain, heart disease, cancer, obesity, digestive ailments, respiratory conditions, fibromyalgia, allergies, and hormonal imbalances. To restore balance and remove obstacles to healing, a naturopathic doctor will typically recommend dietary adjustments and overall lifestyle improvements. The utilization of nutritional supplements, intravenous and injectable nutrients, Chinese herbs, hormone therapy, and acupuncture may also be used, depending on the individual condition.
