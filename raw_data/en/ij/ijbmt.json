In the interests of clarityand rationality, the said Directives should therefore be codifiedbyassemblingtheminasingletext. (2)The essential aimof any rules governing the production, distri-bution and use of medicinal products must be to safeguardpublichealth. (3)However, this objective must be attained by means which willnot hinder the development of the pharmaceutical industry ortradeinmedicinalproductswithintheCommunity. (4)Trade in medicinal products within the Community is hinderedby disparities between certain national provisions, in particularbetween provisions relating to medicinal products (excluding substances or combinations of substances which are foods, animalfeeding-stuffsortoiletpreparations),andsuchdisparitiesdirectlyaffectthefunctioningoftheinternalmarket. (5)Such hindrances must accordingly be removed; whereas thisentailsapproximationoftherelevantprovisions. (6)Inorder toreduce the disparities which remain, rules shouldbe laid down on the control of medicinal products and the duties incumbentupontheMemberStates'competentauthoritiesshouldbe specified with a view to ensuring compliance with legalrequirements. (7)The concepts of harmfulness and therapeutic efficacy can onlybe examined in relation to each other and have only a relativesignificance depending on the progress of scientific knowledgeand the use for which the medicinal product is intended. The particularsanddocumentswhichmustaccompanyanapplication formarketingauthorization foramedicinal productdemonstratethatpotentialrisksareoutweighedbythetherapeuticefficacyoftheproduct. (8)Standards and protocols for the performance of tests and trialsonmedicinalproductsareaneffectivemeansofcontroloftheseproductsandhenceofprotectingpublichealthandcanfacilitatethe movement of these products by laying down uniform rules applicable to tests and trials, the compilation of dossiers and theexaminationofapplications. (9)Experience has shown that it is advisable to stipulate more precisely the cases in which the results of toxicological and pharmacological tests or clinical trials do not have to beprovided with aview to obtaining authorization fora medicinalproduct which is essentially similar to an authorized product,while ensuring that innovative firms are not placed at a disad- vantage. (10)However, there are reasons of public policy for not conducting repetitivetestsonhumansoranimalswithoutover-ridingcause. (11)The adoption of the same standards and protocols by all theMemberStateswillenablethecompetentauthoritiestoarriveattheirdecisionsonthebasisofuniformtestsandbyreference to uniformcriteria and will therefore help to avoid differences in evaluation.

(13)For this purpose, a Committee for Proprietary MedicinalProducts should be set up attached to the European Agency forthe Evaluation of Medicinal Products established in the above-mentionedRegulation(EEC)No2309/93.

(15)In order better to protect public health and avoid any unneces-sary duplication of effort during the examination of application for a marketing authorization for medicinal products, Member States should systematically prepare assessment reports inrespect of each medicinal product which is authorized bythem,and exchange the reports upon request. Furthermore, a MemberState should be able to suspend the examination of an applica-tion for authorization to place a medicinal product on the market which is currently under active consideration in another Member State with a view to recognizing the decision reachedbythelatterMemberState. (16)Following the establishment of the internal market, specific controlstoguaranteethequalityofmedicinalproductsimported fromthird countries can be waived only if appropriate arrange-ments have been made by the Community to ensure that thenecessarycontrolsarecarriedoutintheexportingcountry. (17)It is necessary to adopt specific provisions for immunologicalmedicinal products, homeopathic medicinal products, radiophar-maceuticals, and medicinal products based on human blood orhumanplasma. (18)Any rules governing radiopharmaceuticals must take into account the provisions of Council Directive 84/466/Euratomof 3September 1984laying downbasicmeasuresfortheradiationprotection of persons undergoing medical examination or treat-ment( 2).AccountshouldalsobetakenofCouncil Directive 80/ 836/Euratomof 15 July 1980 am ending the Directives laying down the basic safety standards for the health protection of the generalpublicandworkersagainstthedangersofionizingradia-tion( 3), the objective of which is to prevent the exposure of workers or patients to excessive or unnecessarily high levels ofionizingradiation, andinparticular ofArticle5cthereof,whichrequires prior authorization for the addition of radioactive2001L0083\u2014EN\u201408.02.2003\u2014001.001\u20144 (1) OJL214,24.8.1993,p.1.RegulationasamendedbyCommissionRegula- tion(EC)No649/98(OJL88,24.3.1998,p.7).

(19)The Community entirely supports the efforts of the Council ofEuropetopromote voluntaryunpaidbloodandplasmadonationto attain self-sufficiency throughout the Community in thesupplyofbloodproducts,andtoensurerespectforethicalprin- ciplesintradeintherapeuticsubstancesofhumanorigin. (20)The rules designed to guarantee the quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal products derived from human blood or human plasma must be applied in the same manner to both public and private establishments, and to blood and plasma imported fromthirdcountries. (21)Having regard to the particular characteristics of these homeo-pathic medicinal products, such as the very low level of activeprinciples they contain and the difficulty of applying to themthe conventional statistical methods relating to clinical trials, itis desirable to provide a special, simplified registration proce-dure for those homeopathic medicinal products which are placed on the market without therapeutic indications in a phar- maceutical formanddosagewhichdonotpresentariskforthepatient. (22)The anthroposophic medicinal products described in an officialpharmacopoeia and prepared by a homeopathic method are tobe treated, as regards registration and marketing authorization,inthesamewayashomeopathicmedicinalproducts. (23)It is desirable in the first instance to provide users of thesehomeopathic medicinal products with a very clear indication oftheir homeopathic character and with sufficient guarantees oftheirqualityandsafety. (24)The rules relating to the manufacture, control and inspection ofhomeopathic medicinal products must be harmonized to permitthecirculationthroughouttheCommunityofmedicinalproductswhicharesafeandofgoodquality. (25)Theusualrulesgoverningtheauthorization tomarketmedicinalproducts should be applied to homeopathic medicinal productsplaced on the market with therapeutic indications or in a form which may present risks which must be balanced against the desired therapeutic effect. In particular, those Member Stateswhich have a homeopathic tradition should be able to applyparticularrulesfortheevaluationoftheresultsoftestsandtrialsintended to establish the safety and efficacy of these medicinal productsprovidedthattheynotifythemtotheCommission.

(28)Before an authorization to market an immunological medicinal product or derived from human blood or human plasma can be granted, the manufacturer must demonstrate his ability to attainbatch-to-batch consistency. Before an authorization to market amedicinal product derived from human blood or human plasmacan be granted, the manufacturer must also demonstrate the absence of specific viral contamination, to the extent that the stateoftechnologypermits. (29)Theconditionsgoverningthesupplyofmedicinalproductstothepublicshouldbeharmonized. (30)InthisconnectionpersonsmovingaroundwithintheCommunityhave the right to carry a reasonable quantity of medicinalproducts lawfully obtained for their personal use. It must also2001L0083\u2014EN\u201408.02.2003\u2014001.001\u20145B be possible for a person established in one Member State to receive fromanother Mem ber State a reasonable quantity ofmedicinalproductsintendedforhispersonaluse. (31)In addition, by virtue of Regulation (EC) No 2309/93, certainmedicinal products are the subject of a Community marketingauthorization.Inthiscontext,theclassificationforthesupplyofmedicinal productscoveredbyaCommunitymarketingauthori-zationneedstobeestablished.Itisthereforeimportanttosetthecriteria on the basis of which Community decisions will be taken. (32)It is therefore appropriate, as an initial step, to harmonize the basicprinciplesapplicable totheclassification forthesupplyofmedicinal products in the Community or in the Member Stateconcerned,whiletakingasastartingpointtheprinciplesalreadyestablished on this subject by the Council of Europe as well as the work of harmonization completed within the framework of the United Nations, concerning narcotic and psychotropicsubstances. (33)The provisions dealing with the classification of medicinalproducts for the purpose of supply do not infringe the nationalsocial security arrangements for reimbursement or payment for medicinalproductsonprescription. (34)Many operations involving the wholesale distribution of medic- inal products for human use may cover several Member Statessimultaneously.

(36)Any person involved in the wholesale distribution of medicinal productsshouldbeinpossessionofaspecialauthorization.Phar- macists and persons authorized to supply medicinal products tothe public, and who confine themselves to this activity, shouldbeexemptfromobtainingthisauthorization.Itishoweverneces-sary, in order to control the complete chain of distribution of medicinal products, that pharmacists and persons authorized to supply medicinal products to the public keep records showingtransactionsinproductsreceived. (37)Authorizationmustbesubjecttocertainessentialconditionsanditistheresponsibility oftheMemberStateconcerned toensurethat such conditions are met; whereas each Member State must recognizeauthorizationsgrantedbyotherMemberStates. (38)Certain Member States impose on wholesalers who supply medicinal products to pharmacists and on persons authorized tosupply medicinal products to the public certain public serviceobligations.

(42)This Directive is without prejudice to the application of measures adopted pursuant to Council Directive 84/450/EEC of 10 September 1984 relating to the approximation of the laws,regulations and administrative provisions of the Member Statesconcerningmisleadingadvertising( 1). (43)All Member States have adopted further specific measuresconcerning the advertising of medicinal products. There aredisparities between these measures. These disparities are likelyto have an impact on the functioning of the internal market,since advertising disseminated in one Member State is likely to haveeffectsinotherMemberStates. (44)CouncilDirective89/552/EECof3October1989onthecoordi- nation of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation oradministrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities( 2) prohibits the television advertising of medicinal products which are available only onmedicalprescriptionintheMemberStatewithinwhosejurisdic-tion the television broadcaster is located. This principle shouldbemadeofgeneralapplicationbyextendingittoothermedia. (45)Advertising to the general public, even of non-prescriptionmedicinal products, could affect public health, were it to beexcessive and ill-considered. Advertising of medicinal productsto the general public, where it is permitted, ought therefore tosatisfycertainessentialcriteriawhichoughttobedefined. (46)Furthermore, distribution of samples free of charge to thegeneralpublicforpromotionalendsmustbeprohibited.

These tests are essential for checking the conformity of the medicinal product with the formula when, exceptionally, an applicant proposes an analytical method for testing the finished product which does not include the assay of all the active substances (or of all the excipient constituents subjecttothesamerequirementsastheactivesubstances). Thesameapplieswherethequalitycontrolofthefinishedproductdepends on in-process control tests, particularly if the medicinal product is essen- tiallydefinedbyitsmethodorpreparation. 2. For biological medicinal products, such as immunological medicinal productsandmedicinalproductsderivedfromhumanbloodorplasma,the procedures and the criteria of acceptability published as recommendations oftheWHO( Requirements for Biological Substances )shallserveasguide- lines for all controls of production stages which are not specified in the European Pharmacopoeia , or falling this, in the national pharmacopoeia ofaMemberState. For inactivated or detoxified vaccines, effective inactivation or detoxifica- tion shall be verified during each production run, unless this control is dependent upon a test for which the availability of susceptible animals is limited. In this case, the test shall be carried out until consistency of production and correlation with appropriate in process controls have been establishedandthereaftercompensatedbyappropriatein-processcontrols. 3. For modified or adsorbed allergen products, the products shall be qualita- tively and quantitatively characterized at an intermediate stage, as late as possibleinthemanufacturingprocess.

Identification and assay of active substance(s) Identificationandassayoftheactivesubstance(s)shallbecarriedouteither in an average representative sample from the production batch or in a numberofdosage-unitsanalysedindividually. Unlessthereisappropriatejustification,themaximumacceptabledeviation in the active substance content of the finished product shall not exceed \u00b15%atthetimeofmanufacture. On the basis of the stability tests, the manufacturer must propose and justifymaximumacceptabletolerancelimitsintheactivesubstancecontent ofthefinishedproductuptotheendoftheproposedshelf-life. Incertain exceptional casesofparticularly complexmixtures, whereassay of active substances which are very numerous or present in very low amounts would necessitate an intricate investigation difficult to carry out in respect of each production batch, the assay of one or more active substancesinthefinishedproductmaybeomitted,ontheexpresscondition thatsuchassaysaremadeatintermediatestagesintheproductionprocess. This relaxation may not be extended to the characterization of the substances concerned. This simplified technique shall be supplemented by a method of quantitative evaluation, enabling the competent authority to havetheconformityofthemedicinalproductwithitsspecificationverified afterithasbeenplacedonthemarket. Anin vivoorin vitrobiological assay shall be obligatory when physico- chemical methods cannot provide adequate information on the quality of the product. Such an assay shall, whenever possible, include reference materials and statistical analysis allowing calculation of confidence limits. Where thesetestscannot becarried outonthefinishedproduct, theymay be performed at an intermediate stage, aslate as possible in the manufac- turingprocess.

For biological medicinal products such as immunological medicinal productsandmedicinalproductsderivedfromhumanbloodorplasma,the requirements of this Part may have to be adapted for individual products; thereforethetestingprogrammecarriedoutshallbejustifiedbytheappli- cant. In establishing the testing programme, the following shall be taken into consideration: \u2014 all tests requiring repeated administration of the product shall be designed to take account of the possible induction of, and interference by,antibodies; \u2014 examination of reproductive function, of embryo/foetal and perinatal toxicity, of mutagenic potential and of carcinogenic potential shall be considered.

Directive as amended by Directive 90/18/EEC (OJL 11, 13.1.1990,p.37).B II.PERFORMANCE OF TESTS A.Toxicity 1.Single dose toxicity An acute test is a qualitative and quantitative study of the toxic reactions which may result from a single administration of the active substance or substances contained in the medicinal product, in the proportions and physico-chemicalstateinwhichtheyarepresentintheactualproduct. The acute toxicity test must be carried out in two or more mammalian species of known strain unless a single species can be justified. At least two different routes of administration shall normally be used, one being identical withorsimilartothatproposedforuseinhumanbeingsandthe otherensuringsystemicexposuretothesubstance. This study will cover the signs observed, including local reactions. The period during which the test animals are observed shall be fixed by the investigator as being adequate to reveal tissue or organ damage or recovery, usually for a period of 14 days but not less than 7 days, but withoutexposingtheanimalstoprolongedsuffering.Animalsdyingduring the observation period should be subject to autopsy as also should all animals surviving to the end of the observation period. Histopathological examinations should be considered on any organ showing macroscopic changes at autopsy. The maximum amount of information should be obtainedfromtheanimalsusedinthestudy. Thesingledosetoxicitytestsshouldbeconductedinsuchawaythatsigns of acute toxicity are revealed and the mode of death assessed as far as reasonably possible. In suitable species, a quantitative evaluation of the approximate lethal dose and information on the dose effect relationship shouldbeobtained,butahighlevelofprecisionisnotrequired. Thesestudiesmaygivesomeindicationofthelikelyeffectsofacuteover- dosage in man and may be useful for the design of toxicity studies requiringrepeateddosingonthesuitableanimalspecies.

Generally, it is desirable that two tests be performed: one short-term, lasting two to four weeks, the other long-term. The duration of the latter shalldependontheconditionsofclinicaluse.Itspurposeshallbetodeter- Reasonsshouldalsobegivenforthedosageschosen.Repeated dose toxicity tests shall be carried out on two species of mammals one of which must be a non-rodent. The choice of route(s) of administration employed shall depend on the intended therapeutic useand the possibilities of systemic absorption. The method and frequency of dosageshallbeclearlystated. The maximum dose should be chosen so as to bring harmful effects to light. The lower doses will then enable the animal's tolerance of the producttobedetermined. Whereverpossible,andalwaysinexperimentsonsmallrodents,thedesign oftheexperimentandthecontrolproceduresmustbesuitedtothescaleof theproblembeingtackledandenablefiduciallimitstobedetermined. The evaluation of the toxic effects shall be basedon observation of beha- viour, growth, haematological and biochemical tests, especially those relating to the excretory mechanism, and also on autopsy reports and accompanying histological data. The choice and range of each group of2001L0083\u2014EN\u201408.02.2003\u2014001.001\u201460B tests will depend on the species of animal used and the state of scientific knowledgeatthetime. Inthecaseofnewcombinationsofknownsubstancesthathavebeeninves- tigated in accordance with the provisions of this Directive, the chronic long-termtests m ay, except where acute and sub-acute toxicity tests have demonstrated potentiation or novel toxic effects, be suitably modified by theinvestigatorwhoshallsubmithisreasonsforsuchmodification. B.Examinationofreproductivefunction If the results of other tests reveal anything suggesting harmful effects on progeny or impairment of male or female reproductive function, this shall beinvestigatedbyappropriatetests. C.Embryo/foetal andperinataltoxicity Thisinvestigationcomprisesademonstrationofthetoxicandespeciallythe teratogenic effectsobservedintheissueofconceptionwhenthemedicinal product under investigation has been administered to the female during pregnancy. Although up to the present these tests have had only a limited predictive value in regard tothe application ofthe resultstohuman beings,they are thought to provide important information where the results show effects suchasresorptionsandotheranomalies. Omission of these tests, either because the medicinal product will not normallybeusedbywomencapable ofchild-bearing orforotherreasons, mustbeadequatelyjustified.

Thedetailsofthetest(numberofanimals,amountsadministered,timingof administration and criteria for evaluation of results) shall depend on the state of scientific knowledge at the time when the application is lodged, andthelevelofstatisticalsignificancethattheresultsmustattain.

F.Pharmacodynamics Thisheading inthe functionsofthephysiologicalsystems,whetherthesefunctionsarenormal orexperimentallymodified. Thisstudyshallfollowtwodistinctlinesofapproach.2001L0083\u2014EN\u201408.02.2003\u2014001.001\u201461B Firstly, the actions on which the recommended application in therapeutic practice is based shall be adequately described. The results shall be expressed in quantitative terms using, (e.g. dose-effect curves, time-effect curves etc.), and wherever possible, compared with data relating to a substance whoseactivity is known.Where a higher therapeutic potency is being claimed for a substance, the difference shall be demonstrated and showntobestatisticallysignificant. Secondly,theinvestigator shallprovideageneral pharmacological charac- terization of the substance, establish their validity. The experimental results shall be set out clearly and, when relevant to the test, their statistical significance quoted. Unless good reasons are given to the contrary, any quantitative modifica- tion of responses resulting fromrepeated adm inistration of the substance shallbeinvestigated. Tests on combinations of active substances may be prompted either by pharmacologicalpremissesorbyindicationsoftherapeuticeffect. Inthefirstcase,thepharmacodynamicstudyshalldemonstratethoseinter- actionswhichmightmakethecombinationofvalueintherapeuticuse. In the second case, where scientific justification for the combination is sought through therapeutic experimentation, the investigation shall deter- mine whether the effects expected from the combination can be demonstratedinanimals,andtheimportanceofanycollateral effectsshall atleastbeinvestigated. If a combination includes a novel active substance, the latter must previouslyhavebeenstudiedindepth. G.Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokineticsmeansthestudyofthefateoftheactivesubstancewithin theorganism,andcoversthestudyoftheabsorption,distribution,biotrans- formationandexcretionofthesubstance. The study of these different phases may be carried out both by means of physical,chemical orbiologicalmethods,andbyobservationoftheactual pharmacodynamicactivityofthesubstanceitself. Information on distribution and elimination (i.e. biotransformation and excretion)shallbenecessaryinallcaseswheresuchdataareindispensable to determine the dosage for humans, and in respect of chemotherapeutic substances (antibiotics, etc.) and substances whose use depends on their non-pharmacodynamiceffects(e.g.numerousdiagnosticagents,etc.). Pharmacokinetic investigation of pharmacologically active substances is necessary. In the case of new combinations of known substances which have been investigatedinaccordancewiththeprovisionsofthisDirective,pharmaco- kinetic studies may not be required, if the toxicity tests and therapeutic experimentationjustifytheiromission. H.Localtolerance The purpose of local tolerance studies is to ascertain whether medicinal products (both active substances and excipients) are tolerated at sites in the body which may come into contact with the medicinal product as a result of its administration in clinical use. The testing strategy shall be such that any mechanical effects of administration or purely physico- chemical actionsoftheproductcanbedistinguishedfromtoxicological or pharmacodynamicones. I.Well-establishedmedicinaluse Forthe purpose of demonstrating, pursuant to Article 10(1)(a)(ii), that the component(s) of a medicinal product have a well established use, with an acceptablelevelofsafety,thefollowingspecificrulesshallapply: (a) Factors which have to be taken into account in order to establish a 'well established medicinal use' of components of medicinal products arethetimeoverwhichasubstancehasbeenused,quantitativeaspects2001L0083\u2014EN\u201408.02.2003\u2014001.001\u201462B ofthe useof the substance,the degree of scientific interest in the use ofthesubstance(reflectedinthepublishedscientificliterature)andthe coherenceofscientificassessments.Thereforedifferentperiodsoftime may be necessary for establishing 'well established use' of different substances.Inanycase,however,theperiodoftimerequiredforestab- lishing a 'well established medicinal use' of a component of a medicinal product must not be less than one decade from the first systematic and documented use of that substance as a medicinal productintheCommunity. (b) Thedocumentationsubmittedbytheapplicantshouldcoverallaspects of the safety assessment and must include or refer to a review of the relevant literature, taking into account pre- and postmarketing studies and published scientific literature concerning experience in the form ofepidemiologicalstudiesandinparticularofcomparativeepidemiolo- gical studies. All documentation, both favourable and unfavourable, shouldbecommunicated. (c) Particularattentionmustbepaidtoanymissinginformation andjusti- fication must be given why demonstration of an acceptable level of safetycanbesupportedalthoughsomestudiesarelacking. (d) The Expert report must explain the relevance of any data submitted which concern a product different fromthe product intended for marketing.Ajudgmentmustbemadewhethertheproductstudiedcan be considered as similar to the product which will be granted a marketingauthorisationinspiteoftheexistingdifferences. (e) Post-marketing experience with other products containing the same components is of particular importance and applicants should put a specialemphasisonthisissue.
