KEY FACTS The companies [that signed](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200908005282/en/) the pledge AstraZeneca, BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax, Pfizer and Sanofi. The CEOs \"want to make clear our on-going commitment to developing and testing potential vaccines for COVID-19 in accordance with high ethical standards and sound scientific principles,\" according to the pledge. Although the Centers for Disease Control previously [instructed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2020/09/02/cdc-tells-states-to-prepare-for-coronavirus-vaccine-by-nov-1---though-doubts-remain/#787eeb6feaec) all 50 U.S. states to prepare for vaccine distribution by November 1, the CEOs' letter says they will follow regulatory guidance from the Food and Drug Administration and similar agencies to approve their vaccines, which includes \"large, high quality clinical trials.\" The pledge is intended to counter political pressure to have a vaccine available quickly at the expense of safety, according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-08/drugmakers-join-to-pledge-no-safety-shortcuts-for-covid-vaccine?utm_source=twitter&utm_content=business&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm_medium=social&sref=Msr1H3l1), which cited Trump's pressure on the efforts, including the [possibility](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-says-without-evidence-vaccine-could-be-ready-election-day-n1236029) of a vaccine being ready by Election Day. Trump previously [said](https://www.statnews.com/2020/08/27/trump-pledge-vaccine-end-2020/) during the Republican National Convention: \"We are delivering life-saving therapies, and will produce a vaccine before the end of the year, or maybe even sooner.\" The pledge also follows an August 22 [accusation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/08/22/trump-says-deep-state-or-whoever-at-fda-delaying-covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-testing/#34ac8d0af48d) by Trump that the FDA is intentionally delaying coronavirus vaccine testing through efforts of the [\"deep state,\"](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/15/834874400/in-deep-challenges-president-trump-s-notion-of-a-deep-state-conspiracy) a conspiracy theory that government officials are working against Trump and his administration. Crucial quote \"Following guidance from expert regulatory authorities such as FDA regarding the development of COVID-19 vaccines, consistent with existing standards and practices, and in the interest of public health, we pledge to always make the safety and well-being of vaccinated individuals our top priority,\" the CEOs wrote in the pledge. \"We believe this pledge will help ensure public confidence in the rigorous scientific and regulatory process by which COVID-19 vaccines are evaluated and may ultimately be approved.\" Big number 65%. That's how many Americans said they would be skeptical of a coronavirus vaccine if it was made available this year, fearing possible safety shortcuts, [according to](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattperez/2020/09/06/65-of-us-voters-would-be-skeptical-of-a-covid-19-vaccine-this-year/#5f632db52bcb) a September 6 CBS News/YouGov poll. Key background The CEOs' pledge comes amid the global race to develop a safe, effective vaccine against the coronavirus, for which no treatment exists. At least 37 vaccines are being tested around the world on humans, according to the New York Times' [vaccine tracker](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html), while 90 more are in the earlier stages of testing. Vaccine development usually takes around 10 years due to regulatory processes and approvals, but the U.S. with Operation Warp Speed, along with other efforts around the world, are working to drastically cut down on that timeline. The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-vaccine-election/2020/09/05/c0da86d6-edf5-11ea-99a1-71343d03bc29_story.html) reported Saturday that Trump is fixated on delivering a vaccine as part of his bid for reelection, coming as [national polls](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_biden-6247.html) show Democratic nominee Joe Biden with a solid lead over Trump. Trump largely hasn't been able to move the polls in his favor, and [didn't see](http://forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2020/09/02/trump-partly-responsible-for-long-coronavirus-shutdowns-and-doesnt-see-support-increase-in-new-poll/#78302f782065) a typical increase in support following the RNC, often referred to as the \"convention bounce.\" Further reading [Trump Suggests 'Deep State' At Delaying Covid-19 Coronavirus Vaccine Testing](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/08/22/trump-says-deep-state-or-whoever-at-fda-delaying-covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-testing/#34ac8d0af48d) (Forbes) [Trump fixates on the promise of a vaccine\u2014real or not\u2014as key to reelection bid](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-vaccine-election/2020/09/05/c0da86d6-edf5-11ea-99a1-71343d03bc29_story.html) (Washington Post) "}
