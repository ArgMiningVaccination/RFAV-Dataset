In a candid press briefing, Thomas Cueni, director general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), said that although 2021 has, in many ways, been an \"amazing year\" for the industry, \"everybody is ashamed and embarrassed\" by the vast imbalances in access to coronavirus shots worldwide. \"At the end of the year we also have to admit we dismally failed in terms of equitable rollout, equitable distribution, and that is something we really need to do better in 2022,\" he told journalists. To date almost 8.6 billion doses have been administered worldwide, yet [just 7.6 per cent of people](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations) living in low income countries have had at least one shot - across high income nations, this figure is 75 per cent. In Africa, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that only one in four healthcare workers have been fully vaccinated. Part of this is because export bans, bumpy production, slower than expected regulatory approval and vaccine hoarding have taken a toll on Covax - the scheme set up to counter \"vaccine nationalism\" and distribute vaccines worldwide. So far just 700 million shots have been distributed through the initiative, [half of the 1.2 billion dose target](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/vaccinating-the-world/). \"We need a kind of social contract, which is based on making sure that vaccines go to those most in need based on public health assessment like frontline health care workers, like vulnerable populations,\" Mr Cueni said. \"I think everybody is ashamed and embarrassed by the inequitable access we see right now.\" But officials involved in the Covax scheme reacted with surprise to Mr Cueni's comments, suggesting he has actually spent much of the pandemic undermining efforts to ensure shots are prioritised for healthcare workers and vulnerable people worldwide. \"Ironic, he personally pushed against multiple efforts around #VaccinEquity over the past 12 months,\" John Butler, head of Global Health Strategies Europe, [wrote on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ButlerJohnW/status/1471517289413447681). \"Mea culpa welcome but what's the learning? How will we stop vaccine inequity part deux?\" During Thursday's briefing, Mr Cueni pointed some of the blame at wealthy countries, suggesting they need to share more doses. He also criticised export restrictions, which have limited distribution of both vaccines and the components needed to manufacture them, and conceded that building production capacity across the globe - especially in Africa - needs to be a priority. But he stopped short of reversing the IFPMA's stance on waiving intellectual property - which the WHO and over 100 governments, including the US, have repeatedly advocated for - suggesting it would not help ease supply shortages. The IFPMA has been consistently dismissive of this policy, which is unpopular among big pharma, arguing a waiver would curb innovation and do little to help ramp up global production. The UK Government is also [among those opposed to a waiver](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/vaccinating-the-world/), warning at the World Trade Organization on Thursday that it would \"not increase the number of vaccines reaching people's arms\" and advocating instead for technology transfer and licensing agreements. Mr Cueni's on vaccine equity comments come amid mounting concerns that - should tweaked vaccines be needed to combat new variants, including omicron - global production will be severely constrained come 2022, which could have substantial knock on impacts on supply to lower income countries. At the IFPMA briefing Rasmus Bech Hansen, chief executive of the analytics company Airfinity, cited analysis suggesting there will be a three billion dose shortfall in vaccines if 50 per cent of production is shifted towards manufacturing variant-specific vaccines. \"If part of the global production starts to be diverted into omicron vaccine production, that will have a significant impact on the global vaccine production availability as it takes time to shift over the production,\" Mr Bech Hansen said.
