It focuses on: The egg-based standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine (QIV) for individuals five years of age and older : Afluria \u00ae Tetra . The cell-based standard-dose quadrivalent years of age and older: Flucelvax\u00ae Quad. The vaccines available for adults 65 years of age and older only: A high-dose quadrivalent . Influenza Vaccines for the 2021-2022 Influenza Season 2 Available Influenza Vaccines Most vaccine products provided through the UIIP this season are quadrivalent (QIV), meaning that they contain hemagglutinin antigen (HA) for each of the four influenza strains recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the 2021-2022 northern hemishpere influenza season (i.e., an influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) strain and two influenza B strains, one from each B virus lineage [B/Yamagata and B/Victoria]). The four standard-dose QIVs contain 15 mcg of HA for each strain, whereas the high-dose quadrivalent (QIV-HD) - available only for adults 65 years of age and older - contains 60 mcg of HA for each strain. In addition to the QIV products, adjuvanted trivalent vaccine (TIV-adj) is also provided through the UIIP this season for adults 65 years of age and over, which contains 15 mcg of HA for three influenza strains (i.e., an influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) strain but only one influenza B strain from the B/Victoria lineage). Note that the live attenuated influenza vaccine will not be available as part of the UIIP for the 2021-2022 influenza season. The vaccines available through the UIIP for people 6 months of age and over are outlined in Table 1. Table 1. Vaccines available through the UIIP for the 2021-2022 influenza season Ages Type of influenza vaccines Influenza vaccine products 6 months to 1 year Standard -dose quadrivalent (QIV) FluLaval Tetra Fluzone year olds for 2021 -2022) 5 years to 64 High-Dose was available only as a trivalent vaccine. Influenza Vaccines for the 2021-2022 Influenza Season 3 New Influenza Vaccines Available in Ontario Afluria\u00ae Tetra Afluria\u00ae Tetra2 inactivated influenza vaccine. Afluria\u00ae Tetra contains a standard dose of hemagglutinin antigen (15 mcg). Key Points Regarding the Use of Afluria\u00ae Tetra In Canada, Afluria\u00ae Tetra is authorized for use in children and adults aged five years or older. Afluria\u00ae Tetra is considered equivalent to other standard dose quadrivalent influenza vaccines available through the UIIP. As with other inactivated vaccines, Afluria\u00ae Tetra can be given to pregnant women.3 The Canadian Immunization Guide states that egg allergy is not a contraindication to influenza vaccination, and individuals with egg protein allergies can receive any age-appropriate influenza quadrivalent, inactivated influenza vaccine. Flucelvax\u00ae Quad was part of the Ontario UIIP in the 2020-2021 season, but only for children and adults nine years of age and older. As of March 8, 2021, it is authorized for use in children and adults two years of age and older. Key Points Regarding the Use of Flucelvax\u00ae Quad In Canada, Flucelvax\u00ae Quad is licensed for use in children and adults two years of age and older. Flucelvax\u00ae Quad is considered equivalent to other standard dose quadrivalent influenza vaccines available through the UIIP. Although Flucelvax\u00ae Quad is grown in cells of canine origin, allergy to dogs is not a contraindication to its use. As with other inactivated influenza vaccines, Flucelvax\u00ae Quad can be given to pregnant women.3 The Canadian Immunization Guide states that egg allergy is not a contraindication to influenza vaccination, and individuals with egg protein allergies can receive any age-appropriate influenza product (egg-based or cell-culture based).4 For additional information, see the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) Supplemental Statement - Mammalian Cell Culture-Based Influenza Vaccines .6 Influenza Vaccines for the 2021-2022 Influenza Season 4 Fluad\u00ae Fluad\u00ae7(Seqirus Inc., Kirkland, Quebec) is an egg-based, surface antigen, trivalent inactivated influenza that is MF59C.1 (an oil- in-water emulsion composed of the the surfactants polysorbate 80 and sorbitan trioleate, in citrate buffer). Fluad\u00ae contains a standard dose of hemagglutinin antigen (15 mcg) for each of three influenza strains recommended by the WHO. Fluad\u00ae was not available in the UIIP in the 2020-2021 season, but has been part of the UIIP in previous seasons for adults 65 years of age and older. Fluzone\u00ae H igh-Dose Quadrivalent Fluzone\u00ae inactivated influenza vaccine. Fluzone\u00ae High-Dose a high dose of hemagglutinin antigen (60 mcg) for each of the four influenza strains recommended by the WHO for the northern hemisphere's 2021-2022 influenza season. Key Points Regarding the Use of Fluzone\u00ae High-Dose Quadrivalent In Canada, Fluzone\u00ae High-Dose Quadrivalent is authorized for use only in adults 65 years of age or older. The recommended dose of Fluzone\u00ae High-Dose Quadrivalent is 0.7mL (compared to only 0.5mL for the standard-dose QIVs). Influenza Vaccines for Adults 65 Years of Age and Over For the 2021-2022 influenza season, one high-dose quadrivalent vaccine vaccine (TIV-adj), and four standard-dose quadrivalent vaccines (QIV) are available in Ontario through the UIIP for adults 65 years of age and older. High-Dose Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine Canadian Recommendations Regarding High-Dose QIV The NACI Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2021-20223 has provided the following recommendation for adults 65 years of age and older regarding high-dose QIV: At the individual -level decision -making, \"IIV IIV -SD (standard -dose QIV) , given the burden o f influenza A(H3N2) disease and the good evidence of IIV3 -HD ( high -dose TIV) IIV3 -SD (standard -dose TIV) in adults 65 years of age and older.\" Vaccine Effectiveness of High-Dose QIV A phase 3 randomized clinical trial9 involving 2,670 adults 65 years of age and older compared the safety and immunogenicity of the high-dose QIV (QIV-HD) to that of two high-dose trivalent vaccines, each containing a different influenza B strain (TIV-HD1 and TIV- HD-2) over one influenza season. The results demonstrated that the hemaglutination inhibition antibody responses of the QIV-HD were non-inferior to those induced by the TIV-HD1 and TIV-HD2 for the three shared strains, and superior for the Influenza Vaccines for the 2021-2022 Influenza Season 5 additional B-lineage strain. The authors concluded that the addition of a second B-lineage strain did not inhibit the immunogenicity induced by the other three strains or compromise the vaccine's toler ability. Standard-Dose Adjuvanted Trivalent Vaccine Canadian Recommendations Regarding Standard-Dose Tiv-Adj The NACI Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2021-2022 does not include specific recommendations for the individual-level use of the TIV-adj.3 Vaccine Effectiveness of Standa rd-Dose Tiv-Adj There are currently no studies that have directly compared the effectiveness of TIV-adj to standard-or high-dose QIVs. A literature review10 published by NACI in May 2018 concluded that: \"There is fair evidence that the MF59 -adjuvanted Fluad\u00ae may be effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization for influenza and influenza complications in the elderly compared to unvaccinated individuals (Grade B Evidence); There is insufficient evidence that Fluad\u00ae is effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization for influenza and influenza complications in the elderly compared to those who received unadjuvanted trivalent inactivated subunit vaccine (Grade I Evidence); and There is no identified evidence on how the high-dose vaccine ( TIV-HD) directly compares to the MF59-adjuvanted Fluad\u00ae (Grade I Evidence).\" Burden of Influenza A (H3n2) Compared To Influenza B Figure 1 illustrates the proportion of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases by type, sub-type and age reported through Ontario's reportable disease information system (the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS)) averaged over nine influenza seasons (2010 -2011 to 2019 -2020).11 The figure illustrates that the distribution of strains varies by age. In adults 65 years of age and over, 79.1% of strains werewere influenza A and only 20.8% were influenza B. Further subtyping of a subset (41.7%) of laboratory confirmed influenza A strains among these older adults revealed 87.5% were A(H3N2) and only 12.5% were influenza A(H1N1). Thus, in adults 65 years of age and older in Ontario, the greatest burden of influenza disease is due to influenza A (H3N2). Trivalent Influenza Vaccines May Provide Some Protection against the Opposite B-Lineage Strain Some recent studies (e.g., McLean HQ et al., Pebody R et al., Ohmit SE et al. , Beyer WEP et al.)12-15 have demonstrated protection from the influenza B lineage in the vaccine against the opposite B lineage, referred to as cross-protection; however, cross protection may not always occur and may vary by season, age and past vaccination history. Examples of cross protection can be seen in Canadian data from the S entinel Practitioner Surveillance Network. In the 2017 -2018 influenza season ( Skowronski D et al.),16 the B strain that circulated was predominantly B/Yamagata; the interim adjusted vaccine effectiveness against influenza B was 55% (95% CI: 38% to 68%) for both QIV and TIV together. The TIV contained B/Victoria (i.e., not the circulating strain) and TIV represented more than two-thirds of the vaccine doses distributed through the publicly-funded programs in the Canadian provinces that participated in the vaccine effectiveness study suggesting that there was some cross-protection.

Proportion of influenza cases by type and subtype for influenza A, by age group: Ontario, 2010 -2011 to 2019 -2020 influenza seasons Data source: Ontario Ministry of Health, integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS) database, extracted by Public Health Ontario on July 31, 2020. Notes: The data only represent laboratory-confirmed influenza cases reported to public health and recorded in iPHIS. Influenza A subtype information is only available for 37.2% of influenza A cases. The possibility of duplicates exists because duplicate sets were not identified and/or excluded unless they were resolved prior to data extraction either at the local or provincial level.
