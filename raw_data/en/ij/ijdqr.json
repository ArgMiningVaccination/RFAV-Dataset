Read our | |ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04784767| | | Recruitment Status : Active, not recruiting First Posted : March 5, 2021 Last Update Posted : September 14, 2021 - Study Details [Tabular View](/ct2/show/record/NCT04784767) [No protocol a first-in-human study of the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of different doses of SpFN_1B-06-PL + ALFQ prophylactic vaccine against COVID-19 in healthy adults. The experimental vaccine in this study contains 2 parts: the vaccine (called SpFN_1B-06-PL) and an experimental adjuvant called ALFQ. An adjuvant is a substance added to vaccines that can help to make the vaccine more effective by improving the immune response or causing the immune response to last longer. The experimental vaccine in this study does not contain the virus and cannot cause you to become infected with the COVID-19 disease. A total of 72 healthy adult participants (age range 18-55) will be enrolled in this study. Participants will be enrolled into one of three study arms: Arm 1: 25 \u00b5g of SpFN_1B-06-PL vaccine with 0.5 mL ALFQ adjuvant in a total 1.0 mL injection volume (20 participants) or Placebo (4 participants) on Study Days 1, 29, and 181. Arm 2: 50 \u00b5g of SpFN_1B-06-PL vaccine with 0.5 mL ALFQ adjuvant in a total 1.0 mL injection volume (20 participants) or Placebo (4 participants) on Study Days 1, 29, and 181. Arm 3: 50 \u00b5g of SpFN_1B-06-PL vaccine with 0.5 mL ALFQ adjuvant in a total 1.0 mL injection volume (20 participants) or Placebo (4 participants) on Study Days 1 and 181. Participants will: - Be randomly assigned to get either the experimental COVID-19 vaccine or a placebo - Receive 2 or 3 vaccine or placebo injections in the same arm muscle - Record any side effects that they may experience for 7 days after receiving the injections. - Have blood, nose swabs, and saliva samples collected at each visit. - Have urine samples collected for pregnancy testing (females only). - Undergo medical and physical examinations. - Answer questions about potential exposures to COVID-19 in their daily life. The duration of this study will be for about 18 months. |Study Type PHASE Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of Ranging Doses of SARS-COV-2-Spike-Ferritin-Nanoparticle (SPFN_1B-06-PL) Vaccine With Army Liposomal Formulation QS21 (ALFQ) for Prevention of COVID-19 in Healthy Adults.| |Actual Study Start Date :||April 5, 2021| |Estimated Primary Date :||October SpFN + ALFQ on Days 1, 29 and 181. | Up to 20 participants will receive 25 \u00b5g of SpFN_1B-06-PL vaccine with 0.5 mL ALFQ adjuvant in a total 1.0 mL injection volume. | Biological: 25 \u00b5g SpFN_1B-06-PL + ALFQ (QS21 Adjuvant) | SpFN_1B-06-PL will be provided in a sterile, 2 mL single-use vial at 0.7 mL/vial, 90-110 ug/mL; ALFQ will be provided in a sterile 3 mL vial at 0.6 mL/vial Other Name: 25 \u00b5g SpFN USP, for injection (0.9% NaCl) on Days 1, 29 and 181. | 4 participants will receive 1.0mL of normal saline as Placebo on Study Days 1, 29, and 181. | Drug: Sodium chloride, USP, for injection (0.9% NaCl) | Normal saline will be provided in a sterile, single-use 10 mL vial Other Name: Placebo | Experimental: 2A: 50 \u00b5g of SpFN + ALFQ on Days 1, 29, and 181. | Up to 20 participants will receive 3 intramuscular injections of: 50 ug of SpFN_1B-06-PL with 0.5 \u00b5g SpFN_1B-06-PL + ALFQ (QS21 Adjuvant) | SpFN_1B-06-PL will be provided in a sterile, 2 mL single-use vial at 0.7 mL/vial, 90-110 ug/mL; ALFQ will be provided in a sterile 3 mL vial at 0.6 mL/vial Other Name: 50 \u00b5g SpFN USP, for injection (0.9% NaCl) on Days 1, 29, and 181. | 4 participants will receive 1.0mL of normal saline as Placebo on Study Days 1, 29, and 181. | Drug: Sodium chloride, USP, for injection (0.9% NaCl) | Normal saline will be provided in a sterile, single-use 10 mL vial Other Name: Placebo | Experimental: 3A: 50 \u00b5g of SpFN + ALFQ on Days 1 and 181. | Up to 20 participants will receive 2 intramuscular injections of: 50 ug of SpFN_1B-06-PL with 0.5 \u00b5g SpFN_1B-06-PL + ALFQ (QS21 Adjuvant) | SpFN_1B-06-PL will be provided in a sterile, 2 mL single-use vial at 0.7 mL/vial, 90-110 ug/mL; ALFQ will be provided in a sterile 3 mL vial at 0.6 mL/vial Other Name: 50 \u00b5g SpFN USP, for injection (0.9% NaCl) on Days 1 and 181. | 4 participants will receive 1.0mL of normal saline as Placebo on Study Days 1 and 181. | Drug: Sodium chloride, USP, for injection (0.9% NaCl) | Normal saline will be provided in a sterile, single-use 10 mL vial Other Name: Placebo - Number of participants with local and systemic reactions [ Time Frame: Day 0 to 7 post vaccination ]Post-vaccination reactions including erythema, induration, pain/tenderness, swelling, limitation of arm movement, fever, tiredness, chills, rash, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, and headache. - Incidents of treatment-adverse events as assessed by FDA Toxicity grading scale.
