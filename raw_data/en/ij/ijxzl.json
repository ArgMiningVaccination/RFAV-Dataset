Additionally, you will not be able to book an appointment by phone. Please do not call our offices inquiring about a vaccine appointment. You will be redirected to our wait list. Three Covid-19 Tests Leaf Medical is currently offering three forms of COVID-19 testing at all locations. Per the CARES Act, Leaf Medical is not collecting copayments for COVID-19 related visits. Leaf Medical does not submit claims on behalf of our lab partners (Quest and LabCorp). All lab bill inquiries should be discussed directly with Quest or LabCorp. *Currently the rapid test that Leaf Medical has available also tests for the influenza A and B (flu). Please note that not all insurances will cover the cost of the flu test. If you have specific concerns, you may want to call your insurance provider ahead of your visit to confirm they will cover the cost of your rapid tests. RAPID TEST (QUIDEL) This is an Antigen Fluorescent Immunoassay (FIA) test that will detect if you are actively infected with the COVID-19 virus. If your doctor did not recommend a PCR test, then choose this test first. You can also request to have an antibody test during the same visit. Turnaround Time: 15 minutes. Results are provided in office or via text with your consent. Accuracy: 95.2% sensitivity for positive results. 100% specificity for negative results. Administered via: nasal swab Cost: Typically, covered by insurance for the Covid-19 test. However, the rapid test that Leaf Medical currently has available also tests for the Influenza A and B (flu). Please note that not all insurances will cover the cost for these flu tests and may go to your deductible. If you have specific concerns, you may want to call your insurance provider ahead of your visit to confirm they will cover the cost of your rapid tests. Cost for those without insurance: Only available to in-network patients. How to book an appointment: To maintain the safety of our patients and staff, we ask that all patients complete a telemedicine appointment first with one of our doctors. This is done to determine which time of day you should be seen. However, if you do not wish to do the telemedicine screening or you're showing symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath, loss of taste/smell, recent travel/exposure/positive etc...) you can only book during our sick visit hours after 3PM, by using our chat system found on the bottom right corner (note: only available during business hours) or requesting an appointment via email at: info@leafmedical.com (DUMBO), info.cg@leafmedical.com (Carroll Gardens), or info.lic@leafmedical.com (Long Island City). PCR TEST This test will detect if you are actively infected with the COVID-19 virus. PCR tests are determined by your physician. If you are interested in a PCR test, please make a [telemedicine appointment](https://www.leafmedical.org/telehealth-appointments). You can also request to have an antibody test during the same visit. Turnaround Time: 2-5 business days (dependent on lab) Results are published within your [Breeze Patient Portal](https://web.gobreeze.com/). Please check periodically for results. Accuracy: Close to 100% accurate. Administered via: nasal swab Cost: Typically, free with insurance. Call your insurance to confirm. Cost for those without insurance: Only available to in-network patients. How to book an appointment: All PCR testing requires a telemedicine appointment, where the physician will determine if you're eligible for this test. The reasons why Covid Telescreenings are required for PCR tests are outlined below. A telescreening appointment can be booked online using the following link. ANTIBODY TEST Serum Antibody IgG (Blood Test): This test will detect if you have had prior exposure to or infection with COVID-19 and have built antibodies for the virus. For most viral illnesses, a positive antibody means prior exposure to a virus and possible immunity to future infection. As COVID-19 is a novel (new) infection, it is unclear if a positive antibody offers immunity. If you have not previously had an antibody test, we recommend doing so. Turnaround Time: 2-3 business days (dependent on lab) Results are published within your [Breeze Patient Portal](https://web.gobreeze.com/). Please check periodically for results. Accuracy: 90 to 100% Administered via: blood sample Cost: Typically, free with insurance. Call your insurance to confirm. Cost for those without insurance: Only available to in-network patients. How to book an appointment: Antibody testing no longer requires a telemedicine screening. If you would like to receive a rapid test or PCR test along with your antibody test, you are required to complete a [telemedicine screening](/telehealth-appointments). However, if you do not wish to do the telemedicine screening or you're showing symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath, loss of taste/smell, recent travel/exposure/positive etc...) you can only book during our sick visit hours after 3PM, by using our chat system found on the bottom right corner (note: only available during business hours) or requesting an appointment via email at: info@leafmedical.com (DUMBO), info.cg@leafmedical.com (Carroll Gardens), or info.lic@leafmedical.com (Long Island City). WHY COVID TELESCREENINGS ARE IMPORTANT Our COVID-19 Telescreenings enable us to appropriately separate our routine/well visits (8:30AM - 3PM) from our sick/potentially exposed/symptomatic visits (after 3PM). Our doctors base their booking recommendations on the patient's symptoms and level of exposure. This greatly mitigates unnecessary transmission of the highly contagious virus, and helps to protect patients and staff. COVID Telescreenings allow our doctors to determine which type of covid test is most appropriate for the patient, thereby preserving resources as there is a current national shortage of PCR testing kits, and helps in reducing backlogs at our partner labs (Quest or Labcorp). Lastly, our physicians can determine whether enough days have passed since potential exposure to ensure that the test can achieve its maximum accuracy. Telehealth screenings are required for patients seeking PCR tests and recommended for patients seeking rapid tests. Those declining telescreening are required to book appointments during our sick visit "}
