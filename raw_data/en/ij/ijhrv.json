To learn more, visit https://www.advocateaurorahealth.org/ (Advocate Aurora Health's combined Illinois and Wisconsin 20 20 community benefits total is not available until after submittal of Advocate's Community Benefits Report to the Illinois Office of the Attorney General.) Advocate Aurora Health Community Strategy Advocate Aurora Health (AAH) has a strong history of commu nity engagement and service. A targeted strategy has been developed to build on this history and to transform the community facing work to provide support for patient health and to build community health. This focused community strategy will impact health outcomes for AAH patients as well as the broader community with the long -term goal of reducing the inequitable gap in life expectancy across the organization's footprint. A multidisciplinary team of leaders from the Community Health, Community Relations, Diversity and Inclusion, and Population Health departments was convened and tasked with developing an integrated strategy for AAH's community facing work. This Community Strategy (CS) core team developed a vision statement to ground this work: We will bui ld health equity, ensure access, and improve health outcomes in our communities through evidence -informed services and innovative partnerships by addressing medical needs and social determinants. 2 | P a g e To execute on this vision, all community facing work will be aligned through a health equity lens. For the purpose of this document, health inequity is defined as differences in health that are systemic, avoidable, unfair or unjust. The overarching aim of this strategy is to decrease the inequity gap in life expect ancy across the AAH footprint. The community strategy goal is to increase life expectancy by 5% in targeted low -income communities over 10 years. This will include alignment of all community health, community relations, diversity /equity and inclusion (DEI), and faith and health partnership work implemented across the organization's footprint. The C ommunity Strategy core team selected six focus areas that are identified in current industry literature as having an upstream effect on health equit y and that are also strongly confirmed by organization -wide Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) data. These focus areas and long -term goals are: 1. Access/primary medical homes \u2014Reduce low acuity ED visits 5% 2025 ; 2. Access/behavioral health servic es--Increase the number of patients receiving Behavioral Health management in primary care settings by 5% per year through 2021 ; 3. Workforce development \u2014Increase healthcare career work readiness of residents in high unemployment communities by expanding trai ning partnerships by 2022 ; 4. Community safety \u2014Assure 100% access to Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner ( SANE ) services across the AAH footprint and reduce the injury rate due to violent crime in targeted southside communities by 5% by 2025 ; 5. Housing \u2014Decrease the n umber of ED patients who are screened positive for homelessness by 5% by 2025 ; and 6. Food security \u2014Implement a food security screening and referral process for 100% of patients across the AAH footprint by 2025 . Impact of the COVID -19 Pandemic The year 2020 will be remembered as a time when the world, including the American health care system, was confronted with the most significant public health challenges faced since the Spanish Flu over one hundred years ago. The pandemic brought profound changes to the way people work, communicate, learn, play, eat, socialize and receive health care. COVID -19 raced across the American landscape bringing illness, suffering, economic struggle and death to people across all racial, ethnic and socioeconomic g roups. COVID -19 shined an even brighter light on the health inequities experienced by low -income communities and communities of color. Notably, communities of color were disproportionately affected by the disease, its many difficult side effects and higher death rates. During the past year, the disproportionate burden of disease and economic stress, confirmed the focus of the Advocate Aurora Health (AAH) community strategy. Through our community strategy, we've pledged to build health equity, ensure access and improve health outcomes in our communities through evidence -informed services and innovative partnerships by addressing medical needs and social determinants. While the COVID -19 pandemic has provided challenges to completing our initial community health improvement plans, the Community Health team has pivoted improvement activities 3 | P a g e and programs to meet current COVID -19 needs while remaining fully aligned with our focus on health equity. For the purpose of reporting community benefits in compliance w ith the Illinois Community Benefits Act (2003), th e content of this report will focus on Advocate Aurora 's Illinois hospitals which are identified as \"Advocate \" for state reporting and local brand identity purposes. Advocate's roots are as a faith -based, n ot-for-profit health system related to both the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the United Church of Christ . Advocate's team members, programs and activities are universally guided by the Advocate Aurora vision of \"We help people live well.\" This document provides a summary of community health programs and activities com pleted across Advocate in 2020 --demonstrating fulfillment of all federal and Illinois state requirements while also living out our commitment to addressing the root causes of health inequity. II. 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment and 2020-2022 Community Health Improvement ( Implementation ) Plans Specific needs to be addressed in each hospital's service area are determined through Advocate's triannual CHNA process , as conducted in compliance with the Affordable Care Act (ACA) . Advocate's hospitals completed the most recent CHNA with the posting of the 2019 CHNA reports on Advocate 's webpage in December 2019. The hospital -specific 2017 -2019 CHNA Reports, as well as the hospitals' 2020 -2022 CHNA Community Health Implementation Plans , can be viewed https://www.advocatehealth.com/hospital -chna -reports -implementation - plans -progress -reports/ . During 201 9, all eleven Advocate hospitals completed co mprehensive community health needs assessments in collaboration with health departments, other hospitals, and community organizations. Advocate Children's, with integrated sites at two hospitals \u2014Advocate Lutheran and Advocate Christ \u2014contributed to assessme nts at those two hospitals. These assessments are also available via the Advocate CHNA webpage link provided above. Using priority setting processes that involved local community health councils, other community experts, hospital leadership and hospital governing councils, Advocate hospitals identified the following priority needs and implementation strategies.

Community Benefits Plan and Program Examples/Outcomes As indicated earlier, the AAH C ommunity Strategy Core Team identified s ix key focus areas to target, all of which have been identified as \"game changers\" in achieving health equity. Most of the program descriptions and outcomes that follow are structured according to these six areas, and the progress/outcomes prov ided are from the 2020 -2022 Community Health Improvement Plans (CHIP)) as well as outcomes carrying over from previous CHNA and CHIP cycles. While programs can often support more than one key focus area, the following examples are organized to demonstrate fulfillment of Advocate's strategy in each focus area and preferably in the area in which programs have the most impact. 1. ACCESS/PRIMARY MED ICAL HOMES \u2014One of the six areas targeted by Advocate's community strategy is improving access and connecting patients to primary medical homes. Advocate is committed to undertaking and supporting initiatives that enhance access to health care, including financial assistance, care coordination, language assistance, culturally sensitive provision of care, and prevention education and wellness servic es across the lifespan and within the diverse communities Advocate serves. Financial Assistance. Advocate offers a very generous financial assistance program, requiring no payments from the patients most in need, and providing discounts to uninsured and insured patients. Patients earning up to six times the FPL, and insured patients earning up to two and half times the FPL, may qualify for a full or partial 11 | P a g e financial assistance discount. Additionally, a Catastrophic Assistance discount is available for un insured and insured patients whose incomes exceed the traditional financial assistance income guidelines and have outstanding patient balances of $25,000 or more for a single date of service or sum of several dates of service. These patients may qualify to receive a financial assistance discount that reduces their outstanding balance to 25% of their net income. For uninsured patients, Advocate will presumptively provide financial assistance if the financial status has been verified by a third party. In thes e cases, the patient is not required to submit a separate charity application. If presumptive criteria are not available for uninsured patients, financial assistance eligibility is available using an income -based screening. Advocate extends its income -base d financial assistance policy to its insured patients as well. Advocate continues to review and refine its policy in an ongoing effort to ensure that financial assistance is available to those who need help. Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) . All Advocate's hospitals have relationships with F QHC's or other community clinics within their service areas for providing care for Medicaid and uninsured patients. Advocate Sherman works closely with Greater Elgin Family Health (FQHC), VNA Healt h Care and Aunt Martha's (FQHC) to coordinate care for low -income patients in the Elgin area. The hospital provides colonoscopies and mammograms to Greater Elgin Family Health patients, coordinated through grant - funded programs. Advocate Condell works coll aboratively with the Lake County Health Department and Community Health Center (FQHC) and Erie HealthReach Waukegan (FQHC), by providing mammograms and some specialty care to uninsured and low - income patients as they are referred to the medical center . Advocate Illinois Masonic and Advocate Lutheran General also partner with Heartland Health Centers and Community Health, one of the largest free clinics in the nation, to provide specialty care to uninsured patients and referrals to FQHCs and free clinics for primary care services. In addition, Advocate Illinois Masonic provides operations space to Heartland Health Centers on its campus to provide primary care for individuals and families that are uninsured. In partnership with the Access to Care organization, Advocate Christ provides mammograms to area uninsured and low -income individuals that are referred by the clinic to the hospital when this service is required. Advocate Trinity works with Chicago Family Health Center and Christian Community Health Center to coordinate care for low income patients. Although Advocate BroMenn ownership was transferred to Carle Health on July 1, 2020, for the first six months of 2020 and in previous years, the medical center maintain ed a Community Health Clinic, in collaboration with OSF St. Joseph's Hospital, whereby both hospitals were responsible for designated clinic patients' hospital care throughout the year. Advocate BroMenn al so provide d operations space and information technology support to the clinic. To maintain quality care excellence and improve quality of life for people seeking care from Advocate, working to find medical homes and to reduce emergency room visits and hospital admissions is essential. Advocate has numerous programs focused on managing 12 | P a g e the patient experience through the continuum of care \u2014through inpatient and outpatient settings, and in the home. Medicaid and Medicare. Advocate actively works to improve the provision of services to individuals and families who are covered by Medicare and Medicaid and that seek services at any of Advocate's 400 sites of care. Advocate collaborates with various community -based organization s (CBOs) and Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) in innovative ways to establish primary care relationships for Medicaid and uninsured patients. Advocate Care Organization (ACO). Advocate collaborates with Meridian Family Health Plan (FHP) of Ill inois as part of an integrated care model for people on Medicaid. Advocate has a strong history of providing high quality care to the Medicaid population within its network with key focus areas, including improved care coordination, access and quality perf ormance. The result has been a reduction in ED utilization due to successfully connecting individuals in the plan to a medical home. Community Health Workers (CHWs). The Primary Care Connection (PCC) program deploys Community Health Workers (CHWs) as comm unity resource navigators to serve patients in the ED. The purpose of the program is to reduce unnecessary ED visits and to connect patients to a primary care home. CHWs educate patients about accessing the appropriate level of care and providing follow -up appointments to a convenient care site for patients during the ED visit. CHWs also conduct a community health assessment to identify social determinants of health and link the patients to social services and community resources that contribute to the pati ents' overall wellbeing. The PCC program has reached over 28,235 patients since its inception in 2017. From January through December 2020, the program served 3,000 patients with a 90-day readmission rate among all patients of less than three percent. Advocate Physician Partners (APP). Advocate population health leaders and community health leaders are partnering to develop new approaches to patient screening and resourcing patients for social determinants of health. Advocate continues to pursue quali ty and utilization improvement activities like the Primary Care Connections intervention to achieve the quadruple aim of improved physician and patient experience, better patient outcomes and reductions in the total costs of care. Mobile Integrated Health (MIH). A hospital -based MIH system has been created to improve the care coordination and reduce readmissions of chronically ill patients at Advocate Sherman as they transition from hospital to home. National data shows that mobile care he lps prevent hospital readmissions, especially in areas where people have limited access to health care and traditional home health services are restricted due to a variety of reasons. The MIH partnership between a physician and an on -staff paramedic, allow s outreach to patients in their homes when the patient is unable to 13 | P a g e make a scheduled clinic visit or when symptoms/conditions arise for which an in - person home assessment is most beneficial to the patient. The paramedic then communicates back to the physic ian to determine the plan of care. In 2020, there were 132 patients enrolled in the program, including 58 Heart Failure, 34 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), 18 Diabetes, three Asthma, two Post Myocardial Infarction (MI), 13 Pneumonia and four Cancer Care patients. Of the 132 patients enrolled, there was only one patient that was readmitted to the hospital within 30 days. In 2020, there was a reduction of 52% in hospital admissions and a reduction of 15% in ED visits for the enrolled MIH patient s, with a total of $2,601,690 in cost avoidance. During the COVID -19 pandemic, paramedics also provided COVID -19 test results via phone for patients tested in the ED. Advocate also provides language and other culturally appropriate services to improve access to a broad range of health -related services . Deaf and Hard of Hearing Program. Advocate Illinois Masonic's Deaf and Hard of Hearing Program provides comprehensive mental health care in American Sign Language (ASL) to deaf and hard of hearin g children, adolescents and adults across the Chicagoland area. (This program is described in greater detail on page 19, under community health strategy focus area # 2. Access/ Behavioral Health .) Language Services. In 2020, despite the challenges of the pandemic, Advocate's Language Services Department proactively deployed strategies to help provide uninterrupted access to language services for patients and their families. Language Services expanded its video interp retation capabilities by deploying more than 500 new IPADS, bringing the total at all IL sites to 1,400. All employed interpreters were setup to work remotely and/or onsite to provide video and telephonic interpreting services. Phones, iPads and computers helped connect patients in more than 250,000 interactions across the system. As the use of telehealth increased, interpreters were seamlessly integrated into the telehealth platforms to continue communicating with patients in their preferred language, resu lting in nearly 2,000 telehealth visits with an interpreter. Throughout 2020, C OVID -19 information was provided in languages other than English to help mitigate the spread in at -risk communities. In total, 32% of all translated documents included C OVID -19-related content. Onsite interpreters, equipment and software were provided for C OVID -19 testing trailers, screening tents, mobile units and entrance screening tables throughout the system. Community -based Hispanic Council. Diabetes is one of the costli est and highly prevalent chronic diseases in the U.S. \u2014affecting nearly 20 percent of Latino men and women. This prevalence is evident in the ER hospitalizations for diabetes -related complications within Advocate Sherman's service area. To address this epid emic, the hospital has joined forces with a cross -sector community -based coalition to educate 14 | P a g e the Hispanic community, cut hospital costs and reduce the risk for diabetes in this population. The coalition has already initiated an awareness campaign and prov ided glucose screenings at highly Latino -visited community venues. Additionally, the coalition implemented online risk assessments with immediate referrals to a medical home, social support services and connections to health insurance coverage for 100 perc ent of individuals newly identified as prediabetic or diabetic through screening events. To more effectively manage diabetes in the Latino population, Advocate Sherman implemented Health Nautica in 2019. HealthNautica is an innovative mobile technology program for prediabetic and diabetic Latino patients that provides disease self - management support, education and text reminders to encourage participants to regularly monitor their glucose levels. In 2019, diabetes glucose screenings were conducted in area s of higher socioeconomic need, including the Elgin Mall Flea Market, several Elgin area laundry mats, and the Carpentersville FISH food pantry. Individuals who have elevated glucose levels are referred to their physician and to the Diabetes Self-Managemen t Program (DSMP) class. The DSMP class, conducted in Spanish, was also held at locations with easy access for community residents \u2014the YWCA, Aunt Martha's Clinic and Centro de Informacion. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, this program was paused in 2020 , altho ugh DSMP class es are scheduled to recommence as a virtual class in 2021. Cultural Health Initiatives. To be responsive to the unique cultural, spiritual and health needs of the diverse communities within its service area, Advocate Lutheran General created a new role in 2020 to address multiple Cultural Health Initiatives . Previously the hospital ha d a des ignated patient navigator (Polish) whose main responsibilities was the Polish community. As of late 2020, the hospital acquired a Cultural and Community Liaison to support the hospital's diverse communities. This individual is responsible for integrating c ulturally appropriate services in the Latinx, Polish, Russian, South Asian and senior populations. In alignment with Advocate Aurora Health, the program seeks to embed diversity and inclusion in all forms of patient care. Additionally, the Cultural and Com munity Liaison program supports community efforts and works in collabo ration with Advocate Lutheran General's Community Health Department. Communication with providers and clinical support services around cultural sensitivities of the patient's care plan a nd possible alterations needed furthers the goal of service excellence for all , promoting an environment that meets the unexpressed and expressed needs of all those in the facility . The opportunity also exists to identify potential barriers and to assess w hat educational materials and hospital resources are needed that support cultural sensitivities , fostering greater communication between the provider and patient/family around the patient's care plan . Due to its late development in 2020, no outcomes have b een reported, however, 2021 program outcomes will be reported in Advocate's 2021 Community Benefits Report. 15 | P a g e LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer) Health Equity Index. Advocate Illinois Masonic was the first Advocate Aurora Hospital to ac hieve, since its inception, \"Leader\" status denomination with the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Health Equality Index. The hospital is one of 765 healthcare organizations, along with all hospitals within the Advocate Aurora Health network with all its hospitals HEI leaders awarded in 2020. Leaders are recognized for policies and services supportive of LGBTQ rights, including patient visitation and employment non - discrimination, staff training in LGBTQ patient -centered and employment non - discrimination, LGBTQ patient services and support, transgender patient services, employee benefits, and patient and community engagement. In 2016, Advocate Illinois Masonic also created an internal LGBTQ Work Group . The medical center has developed processes for gender conforming identification and capabilities to capture gender identify and sexual orientation SOGI data. One way of doing this, for example, is to place a sign on specific rooms as an alert to nursing and physician team members that the room's occupant is a gender diverse or gender expansive (TGNC) patient and to be sensitive of the patient's gender identity/pronouns/name in use. Advocate Illinois Masonic's experience served as the model for other medical centers within the Advocate Aurora Health network to participate in the Health Equality Index in 2020, impacting millions of team members and patients across Illinois and Wisconsin. Despite the circumstances and challenges that the COVID -19 pandemic brought to the entire health care system, Advocate hospitals continued their commitment to inclusive and affirming care for LGBTQ patients in 2020 . Baby -Friendly Hospitals . There are more than 500 hospitals and birthing centers in t he U.S. that hold a Baby Friendly designation, including three Advocate Hospitals \u2014Trinity, Illinois Masonic and Sherman \u2014all of which achieved this recognition in 2016. The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative was established by the United Nations Children's F und (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1991 to offer an optimal level of care for infant feeding and mother -baby bonding. The core components of the Baby - Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) are the UNICEF/WHO Ten Steps to Successful Breast feeding , which are designed to facilitate the role of the birthing facility in providing women the information, care practices and opportunity to breastfeed, regardless of the method of birth. National Healthy People 2020 objectives to increase and extend breastfeeding are aligned with this initiative. In order to achieve better outcomes and use limited resources well, community health leaders are frequently choosing programs that have been evaluated to replicate in their communities. Th ese evi dence -based initiatives increase the likelihood that identified needs will be met. A few examples of the numerous e vidence -based programs implemented across Advocate are as follows. Fall Prevention . Given that falls are one of the most common reasons for older adults to visit an emergency room, Advocate Good Shepherd offered Matter of Balance (MOB) \u2014 an eight -session evidence -based program to reduce the fear of falling among older 16 | P a g e adults. In 2020, COVID -19 impacted the ability to hold MOB sessions. Seven MOB classes were scheduled in the Advocate Good Shepherd service area, but only one class was completed before March 2020. One MOB eight -session class was held for 13 residents at a local retirement comm unity . Additionally, three certified master trainers conducted an eight -hour new coach training in February 2020 at Advocate Good Shepherd to train three volunteers to become new lay leader coaches for MOB classes. Obesity. To combat obesity and its connection to children potentially developing chronic diseases in adulthood, Advocate led the launch of a multi -stakeholder Chicagoland collaborative in 2017 to raise funds to bring the web -based Go NAP SACC program to the state of Illinois. Go NAP SACC is an evidence -based program focusing on pre-school age children for early prevention of obesity. The program's design allows for large -scale training of childcare providers and parents, thus increasing the impact on knowledge, pra ctice and policy. In 2018, the Illinois Public Health Institute secured a two-year grant from the Nemours Foundation to support the annual Go NAP SACC subscription for the state of Illinois. The Go NAP SACC Illinois collaborative launched the web -based Go NAP SACC program in 2018. Go NAP SACC is no longer an initiative in the current Advocate Condell CHIP, however, Advocate Aurora remains a member of the statewide collaborative, networking with other agencies who are implementing the Go NAP SACC program in Illinois. To further address health equity, Advocate works to enhance access to health care, prevention and wellness services for many diverse populations that might otherwise have difficulty accessing/receiving necessary health services. Some examples of the se programs include the following. Ronald McDonald Care Mobiles (RMCM). In partnership with Ronald McDonald House Charities of Chicagoland and Northwe st Indiana, Advocate Children's Hospital provides clinical operations for two Ronald McDonald Care Mobiles serving Advocate's north and south service areas. The care mobiles deliver free, high level primary care services to low -income, Medicaid and uninsur ed families. The care mobiles reach these children by going into the community, mainly at schools, thus eliminating the financial and transportation challenges , which often limit access to care. Like so many other programs, beginning in late March, the R onald McDonald Care Mobiles were unable to provide services due to COVID -19. Instead, the vehicles and clinical teams were deployed to provide COVID -19 tests specifically in communities with a disproportionate burden of COVID -19. Over the next few months, the team provided 694 COVID tests and distributed 7,000 children's face masks. Although the program was paused and then reactivated for limited in -person operations, the care mobiles were still able to provide services to 1 ,934 children , including 879 phys icals and 3,926 vaccines. Students in need of physician/specialty services are referred to local FQHCs and providers who accept Medicaid. In September 2018, the Care Mobile team began screening patients for food insecurity. In 2020, 22% of patients seen by the Care 17 | P a g e Mobile teams were food insecure and were given a backpack with a day's worth of shelf -stable food, as well as information on applying for federal and state programs and connecting to local food pantries. Care Mobile patients also receive 1:1 h ealth education requested by the nurse practitioner and provided by an AmeriCorps health educator. Last year, 72% of our patients received these education sessions. The top three health issues addressed included nutrition, vaccines and dental care. Last ye ar, the Care Mobile team began follow up with parents for compliance on primary and specialty care referrals recommended during the appointment , and assistance was provided with referrals made for community -based social services. Complete data will be available and reported in Advocate's 2021 Community Benefits Report. Advocate Adult Down Syndrome Center. Established in 1992 through a partnership between Advocate Lutheran General and the National Association for Down Syndrome (NADS), the Advocate Medical Group Adult Down Syndrome Center provides crucial psychosocial and medical services to adolescents and adults with Down syndrome living in all areas of Illinois. Each year, approxi mately 2,000 individuals are served through over 7,000 visits, including care in the office, the patient's home, at residential facilities, nursing homes and in the hospital. The Center's multidisciplinary approach to comprehensive medical care, with a str ong emphasis on preventive medicine, provides practical approaches to health education and health risk reduction, including supporting people with Down syndrome in their own health promotion efforts. Reimbursement is reduced given more time is provided to each patient visit to allow individuals with Down syndrome to participate in their own health care. Further, only one-third of the cost of the clinic is reimbursed through billing insurance due to the payor mix. Advocate generously provides some services t hrough the Center that are key to health promotion but that are not reimbursable or billable. In addition to patient care, the mission of the Center includes education and research. In 2020, the Center staff provided numerous educational events and classes (virtual ly, of course, during the pandemic), published research studies, provided extensive educational materials online and in print form, and participated in national and international projects educating about and researching the effect COVID -19 has on people with Down syndrome. Autism Treatment Program. The Autism Treatment Program housed in Advocate Illinois Masonic's Pediatric Developmental Center (PDC) serves children with autism and their families --both those with commercial insurance and Medicaid plans. The PDC remains one of the only centers in Illinois to provide diagnostic evaluations and therapy services for autism to low -income families. In 20 20, for example, 48% of patients served at the center were on Medicaid . The PDC provides both compreh ensive diagnostic evaluations, specialty medical care (developmental pediatrics) as well as comprehensive therapy services (individual behavior therapy, socialization groups, speech, occupational and physical therapy, social work services, parent training and sibling support). In 2020, the P DC provided services to 2,625 unduplicated patients for 18 | P a g e a total of 15,731 patient contacts \u2014at least half of which represent ed patients with Autism. The PDC offers services in both English and Spanish, including ongoing parent training and support to enhance generalization of skills into all environments. Mobile Dentistry Program. The Mobile Dentistry Program at Advocate Illinois Masonic provides access to oral health services for underserved and uninsured individuals. The goal is to improve the oral health of vulnerable populations , including low -income children and families, homeless individuals, older adults and persons with special needs. Services provided include dental evaluations, treatment and education. Patients are seen five days per week on the mobile van. In 2019 , the program served 18 sites, including high schools, elementary schools, organizations that serve the homeless, community health centers, as well as facilities that serve indiv iduals with mental illness, developmental disabilities and seniors. In 2020, the program provided 727 patient visits, serving a total of 352 unique patients. Special Needs Dentistry. The goal of the Special Needs Dentistry Program at Advocate Illinois Mas onic is to improve access to oral health and improve overall oral health for children and adults with developmental disabilities. Most dentists lack the training or equipment needed to effectively serve patients with special needs, resulting in many indivi duals lack ing access to even basic dental care. In 20 20, there were 1,199 patient visits, serving a total of 1,099 unique patients. Parish Nurse Ministry. Advocate fully funds three Faith Community Nurse positions serving in low -income, high need communities. These nurses work in partnership with community -based organizations and multiple congregations in the community. They work with an Advocate -funded Com munity Connector to carry out programs that address health issues raised by the community as critical to them. This includes initiatives around food security, stress and mental well -being, chronic disease management and community safety. Advocate also supp orts a Faith Community Nurse Network of 37 nurses that serve congregations across the Chicagoland region. 2. ACCESS/BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES \u2014A second community strategy is to target access to behavioral health services. Advocate has implemented many progra ms/services focused on improving the continuum of care for the benefit of mental health and behavioral health patients. Medically Integrated Crisis Community Support (MICCS). The MICCS team at Advocate Illinois Masonic is comprised of six clinicians, a ch aplain and a peer support specialist who provide one -to-two therapeutic, community -based contacts per patient per day to acutely ill behavioral health patients on the Northside of Chicago. This is particularly important given the State's closure of numerous mental health hospitals in Illinois. The team goes int o the community to help homeless and indigent patients with situations impacting their behavioral health, such as housing and medication stabilization, thus helping clients improve their overall health. In 2020, MICCS served 104 individuals on 19 | P a g e the caseload . In addition, 100 individuals were served by the injection clinic, many of which are unique patients given they do not need/receive intensive case management. Deaf and Hard of Hearing Program. As briefly mentioned earlier under Language Services, Advoc ate Illinois Masonic's Deaf and Hard of Hearing Program provides comprehensive mental health care in American Sign Language (ASL) to deaf and hard of hearing children, adolescents and adults across the Chicagoland area. The program offers a continuum of ca re that includes clinical assessments; pre -screenings and linkage; individual and family therapy; psychiatric evaluations and medication monitoring; as well as intervention with a 24 -hour phone line connected to a text telephone (TTY) system. A tele -psychi atry network enables the provision of otherwise scarce deaf -friendly psychiatric services in the homes of deaf patients who have received the free videophone equipment and services supported by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Over the years, t he hospital has distributed several thousand free ASL DVDs on HIV/AIDS, STDs, breast health, diabetes, depression and smoking cessation. In 2020, 66 unique patients were served through the Deaf and Hard of Hearing program. First Access Program. Given the high number of admissions and ED visits for behavioral health conditions at Advocate Illinois Masonic and the high number of discharged patients that were not keeping their outpatient follow -up appointments, the hospital's behavioral health depar tment created the First Access program in 2013. The goal of First Access is to provide immediate access to follow -up behavioral health services to support recovery and prevent relapses. Through this program, behavioral health ED patients, as well as patien ts referred by the hospital's inpatient psychiatric unit, medical floors and physicians, are literally walked over to outpatient care by a staff member to ensure same day follow -up for outpatient appointments. Since its implementation, First Access has con sistently increased behavioral health patients' appointment follow -through rates from 40 percent in 2013 to 100 percent in 2019 . All discharged patients received warm hand -offs to behavioral health services and left with an outpatient plan of care. Having achieved that, First Access started to focus on providing access to care to all Advocate Aurora patients and its volumes have steadily grown, providing 825 intakes to patients in 2020 . Community Linkage Specialist (CLS). In response to the increasing rate s of substance abuse and mental illness in DuPage County, Advocate Good Samaritan employed a Community Linkage Specialist that works with Detox and Behavioral Health Unit patients to connect them to the appropriate community support services and resources . This individual also conducts community and home visits with discharged patients. In 2020, the CLS helped coordinate services for patients and conducted 75 patient contacts via phone or Zoom. 20 | P a g e Mental Health First Aid (MHFA). With increasing frequency, mental health is selected as a key community health priority. Mental Health First Aid training for community leaders, hospital staff, first responders and the broader community continued in 20 20 as one evidence -based program desi gned to impact this issue. The eight -hour program increase s participants' knowledge of signs, symptoms and risk factors of mental illnesses and addictions, and increase s their confidence in and likelihood to help an individual in distress. As a result of t he pandemic, the structure of the MHFA training was modified so it could be held virtually to meet the COVID -19 in -person and social distancing restrictions and guidelines. In its service area, Advocate Condell provided Mental Health First Aid training to Grayslake Middle School staff and to Grayslake High School District 214 staff in 20 20. The medical center also sponsored the certification of two Spanish -speaking Mental Health First Aid trainers. Advocate Good Samaritan trained 24 Emergency Medical Services (EMS) students in MHFA in 2020. Following the training, n inety -seven percent of participants agree or strongly agree that they are more confident about recognizing and correcting misconceptions about mental health and mental illness. In addition, f ive Psychological First Aid training sessions were provided to a total of 125 faith leaders and community members in 2020 and n ine additional mental health webinars were offered to 109 community members in the south Chicagoland region. A total of 234 faith and community members attended th ese educational seminars . 3. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT \u2014Advocate believes that many community health issues are driven by social determinants of health (SDOH) and require solutions that include working with non -traditional partners , such as school districts, employment agencies, housing groups, food pantries, s helters, etc. From 2017 -2019, Advocate hospitals partnered with various stakeholders to improve the health of people in the communities served by the health system. Advocate Workforce Initiative (AWI) . The unemployment rate of African -Americans and Hisp anics in Chicago is three times that of their white counterparts. Unemploy - ment rates are as high as 31.9% in some neighborhoods in the metropolitan area as compared to Chicago's overall unemployment rate of 8.2%. The state of Illinois also has the nation' s highest unemployment rate among African -Americans. In 2015, the health care sector was expected to generate 14,000 new well -paying middle -skill jobs annually in the Chicago region through 2019, but there was not enough skilled talent available to fill th ese needed roles. In order to address this issue, JPMorgan Chase made a generous donation in 2015 to the Advocate Charitable Foundation, Advocate's charitable arm, to develop the Healthcare Workforce Collaborative \u2014offering a creative and modern solution to the city's talent shortage and economic disparities. Led by Advocate, this health care sector skills -based training initiative connects Chicagoland's underemployed and unemployed residents with high -quality, in -demand jobs in the rapidly growing health ca re industry. 21 | P a g e Advocate also helped to launch the Chicagoland Healthcare Workforce Collaborative (CHWC). The CHWC is a consortium of leading healthcare employers and industry partners that believe in the necessity of a strong and diverse local healthcare workforce. By leveraging resources and best practices, the collaborative aims to support an inclusive healthcare workforce, provide accessibility for unemployed and underemployed populations, and develop innovative responses to the evolving needs of the he althcare industry. This is achieved by identifying and implementing impactful, data -driven and action -oriented solutions, with a specific focus on populations that are underrepresented in the healthcare workforce. Th e workforce development program: \u00ad Aligns training curriculum to current and emerging job needs; \u00ad Connects job seekers to employment opportunities within Advocate; \u00ad Increases diversity within the healthcare sector; \u00ad Provides career pathways to advanced training or career opportunities in healt hcare; \u00ad Supports economic development in vulnerable communities; \u00ad Establishes best practices, creating a regional/national model; and \u00ad Provides supportive services to remove barriers to employment. To ensure the initiative is broad -reaching and comprehensive, Advocate has established strategic alliances with six colleges/universities as well as numerous community -based organizations, such as Phalanx Family Services, Jewish Vocational Services, Insitu to Del Progreso Latino, etc., to recruit, train and support potential candidates. After successful completion of the training and licensing exam, all participants are guaranteed an interview with Advocate and receive job placement assistance. Since incepti on, the initiative has trained more than 900 participants, with over an 80% graduation rate , and 84% of those participants were persons of color . Four hundred and sixty -five graduates from the initiative are now employed in the health care industry. Nearly 200 of those were employed at Advocate and 84% have maintained employment for at least 90 days. Advocate has also launched the NAVIGATE program \u2014an incumbent worker strategy for frontline team members . NAVIGATE aims to create a more inclusive workforce, one that provides associates with opportunities to develop new skills, determine a career pathway and connect with tools and resources. NAVIGATE has been rolled out at several hospitals, including Advocate Trinity, Illinois Masonic and Christ, South Suburb an, Sherman and Good Samaritan, as well as Advocate Medical Group. Since inception, NAVIGATE has provided progressive training, career coaching for career advancement and a bridge to resources to enroll in desired academic programs. NAVIGATE has enrolled a nd supported 338 incumbent workers, guided more than 150 to identify a career pathway and has nearly an 80% graduation rate with an average salary of $19.17 . Seventy -six percent of graduates were persons of color. When workplaces and education facilities shut down in 2020 due to the pandemic, there was even more urgency in ensuring AWI participants could complete their 22 | P a g e required clinical and hospital externships to join the workforce that needed them. Advocate Aurora enhanced its remote learning technology and leveraged program funds to support partners who required additional technology to ensure program access. Many participants pushed to safely continue in the AWI program with modifications . By completing training and certifications, program graduates co uld immediately enter critical COVID -related roles (e.g., CNAs, respiratory therapists, etc.). Some 2019 AWI graduates were certified before the first COVID -19 surge and some AWI pre -certification graduates were brought on in modified roles to support COVI D-19 teams. Despite challenges and uncertainty, Advocate Aurora was still able to exceed established grant outcomes and hoist the lives of those able to participate virtually. In 2020, 927 program participants received training and became certified, 427 more than the five -year goal of 500. Job placement also exceeded the five year goal, reaching 465 participants as compared to a goal of 300 over the five -year span. Of the total individuals placed in jobs, 197 were Advocate Aurora hires. Based on success es to date, AWI and NAVIGATE are now core components of Advocate Aurora's Workforce Development Strategy. Using lessons learned and best practices from the five -year Chicagoland initiative, plans are to expand the program across the Advocate Aurora footprint in both states \u2014Illinois and Wisconsin. Advocate Bethany Community Health Fund. The Advocate Bethany Community Health Fund was created in 2006 to address the unique health needs of Chicago's West Side by funding programs to promote health and we llness and reduce hea lth inequities and their social determinants. Dur ing its 14 -year term, the fund board allocated $14M for grantmaking and capacity building in four priority areas: diabetes, school dropout prevention, violence prevention and workforce d evelopment. Over the funds 14 -year term, its board awar ded 473 grants to 116 unique community organizations , supporting over 75,000 individuals. In 2020, final funds were allocated to maintain the fund's legacy. The se final allocations included $1.5M to pr ovide continued operating support to community organizations, as well as $272K to Partnership for Safe and Peaceful Communities and AMPT -Advancing Nonprofits to provide continued grantmaking and capacity -building services on Chicago's West Side. Legacy gif ts were also made to three other community organizations focused on increasing minority leadership and employment opportunities. 4. COMMUNITY SAFETY \u2014Advocate also works with community partners to address community safety \u2014a social determinant of health. Some examples are provided below. Acclivus Partnership. Acclivus is a community outreach organization seeking to reduce the incidence of deadly street violence in Chicago neighborhoods. Advocate Christ and Advocate Illinois Masonic, both Level I T rauma Centers serving the south and north portions of Chicago and the suburbs, partnered with Acclivus to provide outreach intervention services and community resources for victims of violence. Nearly one -third 23 | P a g e of traumas at the medical center each year ar e victims of intentional violence, such as gunshots, stabbings and/or battery. Violence, like other epidemics, is predictable and often engaged in as an act of retaliation, so immediate intervention is necessary. When violently injured patients from the Ch icago area are transported to Advocate Christ and Illinois Masonic, chaplains notify Acclivus . Acclivus has a hospital responder and a case manager assigned to each Advocate site who provide counseling to patients and their loved ones , aiming to reduce ongoing conflict in the community and risk of retaliation. Acclivus ' case manager sees the patients in the Trauma Clinic after discharge ensuring comprehensive follow -up care. In 2020, hospital responders at Advocate Christ served 745 patients and made 254 additional referrals to existing community resources . Due to the pandemic and hospital visitor restriction policies, Acclivus provided services and referrals to Advocate Illinois Mason ic patients remotely from March through July 2020. The hospital responders at Advocate Illinois Masonic served 147 patients in 2020, many of which were provided referrals to existing community resources. Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners (SANE). Advocate Condell, Advocate Children's and Advocate's South Region (Advocate's Christ, South Suburban and Trinity) SANE Programs consist of sexual assault nurse examiners who are nationally and state certified by the Office of the Illinois Attorney General . SANEs are available either in the ED or on an on-call basis to provide compassionate, trauma -informed care to sexual assault victims seeking care in the ED. These highly trained practitioners perform head - to-toe exams pertaining to sexual assault/abuse, address medical concerns such as STI (sexually transmitted infection), HIV and pregnancy, collect forensic evidence, testify in court as expert witnesses, and offer access to after -care resources \u2014supporting the victim through the entire process. The thre e SANE program coordinators work closely with a multi -disciplinary team, including local rape advocates, law enforcement, Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) and prosecutors to assure victims of sexual assault receive the best care possible at all contact points. SANE program coordinators also collaborate to provide best practice standardized sexual assault care throughout Advocate so that by January 1, 2022, a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner will be available 24/7, 365 days a year to care for sexually assaulted patients. Advocate's SANE program served 168 adult sexually assaulted or abused patients in the ED in 2020, having provided care despite the challenges of COVID -19 and concerns that prevented many individuals from seeking care in a hospit al setting. In addition, Advocate Condell continued to provide training regarding sexual assault treatment in response to community partner requests for education from Rape Advocacy Centers, Law Enforcement, medical students and others, as well as increase d its participation in Countywide Human Trafficking awareness and prevention initiatives. Pediatric pre -pubescent sexually assaulted/abused patients are transferred to Advocate Children's Hospital for specialty care. Advocate Children's Child Protection and SANE teams partner with area Children Advocacy Centers, DCFS and Law 24 | P a g e Enforcement to provide care to these sexually assaulted/abused children. In general, very few programs in Illinois can meet the needs of this patient population. Sexually assaulted ch ildren who require evidence collection are referred to the pediatric ED (PED) at the Advocate Children's Hospital campuses in either Oak Lawn or Park Ridge. In 2020, 182 sexually assaulted children were cared for in the PED. Sexually assaulted children not requiring evidence collection are referred to one of the Advocate Children's certified Pediatric SANE Child Protection Nurse Practitioners and are seen in the outpatient Sexual Abuse Clinics. In 2020, 69 children were seen in Advocate's outpatient Child P rotection Sexual Abuse Clinics. As with the adult program, the pediatric program coordinators collaborate throughout each year to provide best practice standardized pediatric sexual assault care. Center for Faith and Community Health Transformation . The Center for Faith and Community Health Transformation works to advance health equity by partnering with faith -based and community organizations to build community, nurture leaders and connect the unique spirit power of faith communities to promote social ju stice and abundant life for individuals, families and communities. The Center is a partnership between Advocate and the Office for Community Engagement and Neighborhood Health Partnerships at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Currently, the Center is convening a Trauma Informed Congregations Network to support the capacity of faith communities to prevent trauma and to be places of healing for those who have experienced adversity in childhood or throughout their lives. 5. HOUSING \u2014According to Healthy Peo ple 2020, data indicates that p oor-quality housing is associated with various negative health outcomes, including chronic disease and injury, and poor mental health. It is for th ese reason s that Advocate has vowed to decrease by 5% the number of ED patients who are screened positive for homelessness by 2025. While work towards this goal is still emerging , several Advocate hospitals are taking steps to provide patients with a healthy and safe environment in which to heal. Flexible Housing Pool. In 2020, the Flexible Housing Pool (FHP) at Advocate Illinois Masonic placed one behavioral health patient in permanent housing. The FHP placed an additional three behavioral health patients in transitional housing. The medical center also provides individuals placed in permanent housing with behavioral health and case management services. The Carol Street Apartments. The Advocate Lutheran General Care Management Department plans safe discharges for patients recovering from hospitalization and who have no housing resources. The department manages the Advocate Lutheran Carol Street apartments. Located on the hospital's campus, these apartments are available for rent on a daily , weekly or monthly b asis. The apartments are used by patients that are actively getting services on campus, i.e. chemotherapy, radiation, etc., and are also available for family members of inpatients that do not live near the hospital. Financial assistance is granted to patie nts and families that demonstrate financial hardship. In 25 | P a g e 2020, expenses for electricity, cleaning and rent totaled $7,350. With total revenue from patients or families of just $4,225, the balance of $3,125 was an expense subsidized by Advocate Lutheran Gen eral. This was substantially less than in 2019 d ue to the COVID -19 pandemic. Warming Center. Advocate Illinois Masonic also provides a Warming Center \u2014, a safe warm place for homeless individuals to stay overnight out of Chicago's bitterly cold, wintery weather. In 2020, the Warming Center was open for a total of 400 hours over a period of 50 days at a cost of over $16K to the medical center. There were 180 individuals that stayed at the Warming Center from January 2020 -March 2020, alone. Due to COVID the Warming Center was not open during the latter part of 2020. PADS Laundry Services. While the solution to end homelessness is more complex than providi ng a location for an overnight stay, Advocate recognizes that a clean, safe and secure place to stay is a critical component of lifting people out of poverty. Two Advocate hospitals, Advocate Good Samaritan and Advocate South Suburban, have partnered with PADS in their area to provide laundry se rvices for cleaning linens used in community homeless shelters. This supports the work of DuPage Pads , for example, which is the largest provider of interim and permanent housing in DuPage C ounty . Through the p rovision of shelters as a temporary home , coupled with support services , DuPage Pads helps these individuals work toward becoming self -sufficient. P ADS further provides vital support services to enable individuals to receive case management and life coachi ng employment support , such as job coaching, as well as engagement with employers \u2014 effectively stopping the cycle of homelessness. In 20 20, Advocate Good Samaritan and Advocate South Suburban provided linen cleaning services to area P ADS at a combined total expense of $6,625 for cleaning over 10,400 pounds of linens. This was less than that provided in 2019 due to COVID -19 social -distancing restrictions . 6. FOOD SECURITY \u2014Access to fresh, affordable food is a key ingredient in the recipe to address social determinants of health \u2014and in keeping the community healthy. Advocate is involved with multiple community partners in local and sustainable food initiatives to address foo d insecurity. Some examples of these initiatives include the following. Local Food Pantry Partnerships . Advocate Good Samaritan partnered with local food pantries and the University of Illinois Extension to develop a program that offers healthy fresh food, nutrition and cooking classes to clients of the pantries. In addition to the fresh produce and nutrition educati on provided, an unexpected bonus of the program was that participants began to share some of their own healthy menus with each other during the sessions, expressing that they looked forward to coming to the classes. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, workshops were made virtual and healthy food was delivered to participants ' homes. In 2020, this program provided 8 virtual workshops serving 16 food pantry clients. One -hundred percent of participants stated that the workshops empowered them to sustain a healthy li festyle. 26 | P a g e Screening Seniors for Food Security. Advocate Good Shepherd is collaborating with Senior Service organizations in its service area to screen seniors for food insecurity, using the Hunger Vital Sign\u00ae food insecurity questionnaire. Individuals wh o are identified as food insecure are referred to community resources (food pantries, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Meals on Wheels, congregate meal programs, farmers markets and community gardens ). In 2020, Advocate Good Shepherd staff created a COVID -19 Food and Nutrition Resource Guide , including all area food distribution sites and food pantry's new procedures and policies during the pandemic. This guide was sent to all senior centers and nonprofits in the hospital's service area. RX Mobile Pantry. In 2019, Advocate Condell launched the Rx Mobile Food Pantry to serve food insecure (FI) residents of the Round Lake area. The program grew from the medical center's community health efforts in screening and referral for food insecurity. The Rx Mobile Pantry is held at the Round Lake Public Library and operates two times per month. The initiative is a collaboration between the medical center and six public and private non -profit organizations serving the Round Lake area. In 2020, a total o f 733 individuals were screened for food insecurity by community agencies and Advocate Condell. Based on the screening results of this one year, the community's food insecurity rate ranged from more than five to nine times the rate for the general Lake County population. The collaborating agencies also receive assigned vouchers for food insecure clients from the Advocate Condell community health coordinator, who serves as the project manager. Due to COVID -19, vouchers were not collected in 2020. However, th e need for food resources grew exponentially as a result of the pandemic. In 2020, the Rx Mobile Food Pantry held 24 events; serving 5,267 individuals and 21,076 household members. In April of 2020, the average number of families in need of food grew from 100 families to 270 families per event. By the end of 2020, 339,725 pounds of food were distributed to Lake County residents. The Rx Mobile Pantry Program in Round Lake is scheduled to continue for all of 2021. Lakeview Food Pantry. In June 2018, Advoca te Illinois Masonic established a hospital - based food pantry to address the needs of food insecure oncology patients. In partnership with the Lakeview Food Pantry, the medical center provides dry -good food bags, re -usable wheelie grocery bags and gift card s to low -income and food insecure patients. Nutrition education and community food program resources were also distributed to all program participants. To better meet the needs of patients and team members during the pandemic, the medical center expanded t he pantry to three new services lines (OB/GYN, Family Medicine and the Dental Mobile Van) and food insecure team members. In 2020, the pantry served 180 patients with most patients utilizing the pantry on a monthly basis. Over 3,000 pounds of food was dist ributed to food insecure patients and team members at Advocate Illinois Masonic. The medical center also partnered with Irv and Shelly's Fresh Picks to provide fresh produce boxes to patients. Boxes were delivered directly to the homes of food pantry parti cipants. In 2020, Irv and Shelly's Fresh Picks delivered 60 fresh produce boxes to 17 food insecure patients. In 27 | P a g e 2021, the Community Health Department plans to continue expanding the hospital - based pantry to additional service lines and departments , and to utilize technology to enhance data collection and program evaluation. Advocate Lutheran General Hospital -Based Food Pantry. In October 2020, Advocate Lutheran General's Community Health team implemented a hospital -based food pantry pilot to address food insecurity. In partnership with the Irving Park Food Pantry and internal Advocate Lutheran General team members, nine patient s were served through the Hospital -Based Food Pantry program. Additionally, nine out of the nine patients reported having a health condition and only one patient reported having a job. The program is focused on providing immediate assistance to high -risk patients that screen positive for food insecurity while visiting a health care provider . The goal is not to serve as their local food pantry but as an immediate aid. The Community Health team has included information on local community resources in each food bag for patients seeking additional assistance. The pilot will continue for six months at which time the Community Health team will evaluate the lessons learned, barriers and challenges in efforts to create a sustainable program structure. Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital -Based Food Pantry. In November of 2020, Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital's Community Health team implemented a hospital - based food pantry pilot to address food insecurity. In partnership with People's Resource Center and Advo cate Good Samaritan's Cancer Care Center, three oncology patients were served through the pilot program in 2020. The program is focused on providing immediate assistance to high -risk patients that screen positive for food insecurity while visiting a health care provider . The goal is not to serve as their local food pantry but as an immediate aid. The Community Health team includes health recipes and additional community resources in each food pantry bag. As is the case with the Advocate Lutheran food pantry mentioned earlier, t he Advocate Good Samaritan pilot will continue for six months at which time the Community Health team will evaluate the lessons learned, barriers and challenges in efforts to create a sustainable program structure. Popup Farmers Mark ets. To meet the health needs of the community during the pandemic , Advocate Illinois Masonic expanded its food insecurity work in the community. In partnership with Irv and Shelly's Fresh Picks, Grover Cleveland Elementary School, Community Health, Oak St reet Health and Avondale Faith and Health Collaborative, six popup farmer's markets were hosted during 2020 providing 900 fresh produce boxes, 3,600 pounds of food , and health and nutrition education to hundreds of low -income students, individuals and fami lies. Healthy Living Food Farmacy. Advocate launched an innovative pilot program \u2014 Healthy Living Food Farmacy \u2014at Advocate Trinity Hospital to make a positive impact on patients facing socio -economic barriers to better health. Patients are invited to atten d the bi -weekly events for a free dose of healthy food \u2014making their selections 28 | P a g e from tables of assorted fresh produce and low -sodium, shelf -stable proteins. The program is focused on impact ing the health of the community by providing access to healthy food options for food insure patients. The Healthy Living Food Farmacy is supported by a partnership with the Greater Chicago Food Depository, Advocate Trinity's leadership, volunteers and community health department. In 2020, the Food Farmacy distributed 48,11 6 pounds of food and engaged over 166 patients for a total of 1,660 visits. Community Gardens. Several Advocate hospitals hosted local and sustainable community gardens in 20 20. Advocate Good Shepherd partners with Smart Farm, a local non -profit organization whose mission is to be an educational resource on sustainable gardening and healthy eating. Smart Farm manages the on -site garden on over 10 acres of land owned by Advocate. The harvest of fresh vegetables is don ated to local food pantries. On Advocate Sherman's campus, a large community garden draws hospital staff to plant and maintain raised garden beds. In 2020, Advocate Sherman provided 330 .5 pounds of fresh produce from the on -site community garden. Produce was donated to Elgin YWCA food pantry and the Food for Greater Elgin food pantry. Advocate BroMenn planted the Advocate BroMenn Vegetable Garden at the Community Health Care Clinic and donated food to patients of the clinic. Vegetables are also gleaned from the downtown Bloomington farmers market and distributed at the Veggie Oasis. IV. Addressing Identified Social Determinants of Health with Community Partners To support the Advocate hospitals in conducting CHNA 's, Advocate purchased access to a CHNA data tool . Benefits of the tool not only include identification of health inequities in communities served by Advocate , but also supports hospital and system efforts in working with community partners to address social determinants of health (SDOH) . SocioNeeds Index . Created by the Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, the SocioNeeds Index is a measure of socioeconomic need that is correlated with poor health outcomes. Indicators for the index are weighted to maximize the correlation of the index with premature death rates and preventable hospitalization rates. This index combines multiple socioeconomic indicators into a single composite value. As a single indicator, the index can serve as a concise way to target areas of highest need. The scores can range from 1 to 100. A score of 100 represents the highest socioeconomic need. Within a hospital PSA, the ranking of 1 -5 is a comparison of each zip code to all others within the PSA; a 5 represents zip codes of highest socioeconomic need in the PSA. The index value for each zip code is compared to all zip codes within a service area and as signed a relative rank (1 -5) using natural breaks classification. As an example, t he map on the following page shows the SocioNeeds Index for zip codes in the Advocate Christ PSA. 29 | P a g e Advocate Christ PSA SocioNeeds Index Map 2016 Advocate Christ has four zip codes in its PSA with a ranking of five for the SocioNeeds Index \u2014all within Chicago --which represent the areas with the highest socioeconomic needs: West Englewood, Brighton Park, Chicago Lawn, and Auburn Gresham. The index values for these zip codes are all over 90/100 , thus representing some of the highest area s of need in the country. The following chart displays the index values for the zip codes with the highest SocioNeeds Index values with Advocate Christ's PSA. A similar map was prepared for each hospital service area enabling the hospitals' Community Heal th Councils to focus priority setting and program planning on communities at higher levels of socioeconomic need. Advocate Christ PSA Zip Codes with Highest SocioNeeds Index 2018 Community Name Zip Code Socio Need Index Auburn Gresham 60636 99.1 Source: Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, 2018 30 | P a g e Advocate is working locally and nationally with many prominent community partners to address social determinants of health. E xamples of these efforts include the following. Health Care Anchor Network (HAN) . In December 2016, Advocate joined leaders from health systems in Washington, DC, to explore what it would mean to harness their shared economic and intellectual power to truly benefit their communities. \"The discussion centered on identifying how all of these economic assets (the combined purchases of $65 billion in purchased goods and services, 1.4 million employees and $200 billion in investment an d endowment portfolios), combined with civic leadership ...could be deployed to create inclusive, equitable, healthy and environmentally sustainable communities\" ( Advancing the Anchor Mission of Healthcare, Democracy Collaborative, 2017) . HAN, with over 45 h ealth systems represented in the Network, brings together anchor institutions from across the country that together employ more than 1.5 million people, purchase over $50 billion annually, and have over $100 billion in investment assets. Advocate Aurora , in alignment with HAN strategy, has launched t wo significant initiatives to address health equity in the communities it serves. Advocate Aurora $50M Investment Pledge . In 2019, A dvocate Aurora announced a nationally recognized commitment to invest $50 million with Community Development Finance Institutions (CDFIs) by 2025 to support affordable housing, food centers and small business development in underserved communities. This investment strategy undergirds Advocate Aurora's anchor approach addressing health inequity in the communities we serve. In 2020, the Community Investment Committee developed the Advocate Aurora Community Investment Policy to govern the work, researched best practices nationally and screened multiple CDFIs, leading to t he development of three initial partnerships that will advance $31 million of the funding for local deployment. Advocate Aurora Purchasing Commitment . Advocate Aurora is among the first five health systems who have made a commitment as members of the Health Care Anchor Network to improve the health of the communities we serve by focusing on increasing diverse purchasing spend and meeting important environmental sustainability metrics. \"We know that social and environmental determinants heavily impact heal th outcomes and that deeply embedded economic and racial inequities drive substantial health disparities, which have become even more stark in the current context. We believe that aligning our purchasing power with our clinical and community efforts to imp rove societal health and wellbeing represents the evolving mission of health\" (HAN Impact Purchasing Commitment, 2020 -2021). There are several additional examples of efforts to st rengthen corporate options through human resource, supply chain, environmental stewardship and investment policies that impact the social determinants of health in the communities served by Advocate . 31 | P a g e Environmental leadership. Reducing waste, conserving en ergy and water, minimizing use of toxic chemicals, and constructing eco -friendly buildings for today and tomorrow -all these efforts have a direct benefit on the health of local communities via cleaner communities, healthier air quality, reduced greenhouse gases, and preservation of natural resources. As Advocate work s to reduce the environmental and health impacts of health care, its environmental stewardship practices ease the burden of health care costs both directly (lower energy costs) and indirectly ( lower environmentally -related disease burden), and help save precious resources for future generations. In addition to continuing to reduce Advocate's own environmental impacts as a health care organization, Advocate also provides national leadership and mentoring in sustainable health care through the membership and participation in several sustainability leadership councils and groups. These collaborative partnerships address multiple sustainability issues, including antibiotic overuse in agriculture, s afer chemicals in furnishing s and medical products, climate change, clinical plastics recycling, and environmentally - preferable and local purchasing, spurring movement toward healthier and more sustainable practices throughout the health care sector and wi der marketplace . These partnerships include : \u00ad Healthcare Anchor Network ; \u00ad Health Care Climate Council ; \u00ad Healthcare Plastics Recycling Coalition - Healthcare Facility Advisory Board ; \u00ad Practice Greenhealth Market Transformation Group -Safer Chemicals ; \u00ad Premier's Environmental Advisory Council ; and \u00ad Signatory of the Chemical Footprint Project . Project C.U.R.E. (Commission on Urgent Relief and Equipment) . Advocate is a medical equipment and supply donation partner of Project C.U.R.E., the world's leading medical supply distribution organization benefiting resource -limited areas across the globe. Surplus medical supplies and decommissioned equipment are don ated to Project C.U.R.E. and many Advocate associates volunteer time at its warehouse \u2014sorting and packaging supplies for distribution overseas. In 2020, Advocate donated a total of 53 pallets of miscellaneous medical supplies and 14 pieces of medical equip ment to Project C.U.R.E. Stakeholder Health . Advocate is a founding member and investing partner of Stakeholder Health, formerly known as the Health Systems Learning Group. Members of Advocate staff serve on the Advisory Council and have been actively involved in offering thought leadership as well as contributing to the writing of two seminal documents \u2014a 2013 Health Systems Learning Group Monograph https://stakeholderhealth.org/pdf/ and a 2016 book, Stakeholder Health: Insights from New Systems of Health https://stakeholderhealth.org/stakeholder -health -chapte r-1/. The latter publication, developed and published with the support of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, is a rich and detailed review of some best practices in the areas of community health improvement , and clinical and community partnerships. The fi rst release of the book occurred at an event at the Chicago Theological Seminary and was planned and executed 32 | P a g e by Advocate staff and staff of The Center for Faith and Community Health Transformation. Stakeholder Health aspires to identify and activate a menu of proven community health practices and partnerships that work . Advocate Aurora continues to be an active member and leader of Stakeholder Health. Sustainable Buildings and Operations. Sustainability, safety and efficiency are core elemen ts of Advocate building and operations programs. \u00ad In 2008, Advocate embarked on a journey to reduce its carbon footprint and to become the most energy efficient health system in the country. By 2015, Advocate had reduced energy consumption by 23% from the 2008 baseline. While aggressively continuing energy efficiency projects, Advocate now aims to transition to 100% renewable electricity by 2030. \u00ad In 2020, 85% or 3,090 tons of Advocate construction waste was recycled. \u00ad Advocate pursues Leadership in Energy a nd Environmental Design (LEED) certification for all new major buildings and utilizes a rigorous, internal tool called The Healthy Spaces Roadmap to ensure sustainability in all its renovations and projects . To date, Advocate has completed six major projec ts that have received LEED Silver or Gold certification. \u00ad Advocate combines sustainable facilities with environmentally -friendly operations and purchases. This includes waste minimization and recycling, reducing chemicals in furniture and cleaning products , purchasing meat raised without antibiotics, and other eco-friendly products, all of which have community health impacts in their life cycle. In 2020 , Advocate achieved the following. o Avoided 1,392 MtCO 2e of greenhouse gases (equivalent to 3.4 million mil es of driving) through eco -friendly management of anesthetic gases. o 96% of Advocate's 2020 furniture purchases avoided five key chemicals of concern. o Spent over $65,000 on third party certified green cleaners in 2020 (83% of total purchases in five key cle aning categories). o $886,000 of Advocate's meat purchases supported producers who raise their animals without the use of antibiotics. o Copy paper used contains 30% post -consumer recycled content and is Forest Stewardship Council certified. o Reduced paper usa ge by 23% from 2019 levels --avoiding use of 48,600 reams of paper. o Recycled 3,390 tons of waste from hospital operations. o Recycled 85 percent, or 3,090 tons, of construction and demolition debris. o Saved 36 tons of waste from landfill and saved $1.6 millio n via surgical and medical device reprocessing programs. Environmentally -Responsible Investing. Advocate institutes an environmentally -based social screen for its marketable investment program. All companies in separately managed accounts are scored on environmental practices, behavior and controversies. Poor -scoring companies are screened out of the investment program. 33 | P a g e Advocate Bethany Community Health Fund (Bethany Fund). As Indicated earlier , the Advocate Bethany Community Health Fund was established in 2006 by Advocate as part of an ongoing commitment to help build, promote and sustain healthy co mmunities on Chicago's West Side. While the fund came to a close in 2020, o ver the years the Bethany Fund support ed nonprofit organizations that are in the communities historically served by Advocate Bethany Hospital (now RML Chicago) \u2014Austin, Garfield Park , Humboldt Park and North Lawndale. The Bethany Fund did this through program grants, organizational capacity -building events and partnerships to build on the assets of these communities. (The Fund's final allocation of funds is described in greater detail on page 2 2.) Community Engagement /Collaborative Assessments Advocate works to leverage resources and maximize community engagement by building and strengthening community partnerships with health departments and other diverse community organizations. One of the primary values of Advocate's Community Health Department is collaboration with partners, preferably through a collective impact model. In order to align initiatives with local h ealth departments and their community health priorities , all Advocate hospitals collaborate with their respective health departments during the CHNA and health improvement (implementation ) plan cycles. One such n otable collaborati on for Advocate's most recent 2017-2019 CHNA cycle as well as its previous cycle is provided below. The Alliance for Health Equity (formerly known as the Health Impact Collaborative of Cook County ). Advocate Health Care (now known as Advocate Aurora Health ), Presence Health (now known as Amita Health ) and the Illinois Public Health Institute (IPHI) were the three founding organizations of the Health Impact Collaborative of Cook County (HICCC) . These organizations invited health departments and all Cook County nonprofit hospitals to join them in creating what is now one of the largest CHNA and community health improvement collaboratives in the country. The initial participating hospitals and health departments worked together to design a shared leadership model and collaborative infrastructure to support com munity -engaged planning partnerships and strategic alignment of implementation plans to facilitate more effective and sustainable community health improvement. In late 2017, HICCC merged with the Healthy Chicago Hospitals Collaborative to create The Allia nce for Health Equity (The Alliance). IPHI serves as the backbone organization for the collaborative and the hospitals provide funding for the shared assessment and community health improvement planning work. In 2019 , the Alliance grew to include 37 nonprofit and public hospitals, s ix local health departments and more than 100 community organizations . The Alliance completed a collaborative CHNA between March 2018 and March 2019 .This CHNA can be viewed at https://allhealthequity.org/wp -content/uploads/2019/06/FINAL_2019_CHNA - Report_Alliance -for-Health -Equity.pdf . 34 | P a g e Primary and secondary data from a diverse range of sources were uti lized for robust data analysis and to identify community health needs in Chicago and Suburban Cook County. For the 2019 CHNA, the Alliance for Health Equity built on the previous collaborative CHNA work (2016), previous CHNA reports from member hospitals, Healthy Chicago 2.0 (2016), and WePLAN 2020 (2016). Advocate continues to be actively involved in leadership of The Alliance partnership, serving on the steering committee. Advocate hospitals , as well as the other member hospitals , provide the monetary sup port for the collaborative's work and support the cost of staff and oversight provided by the Illinois Public Health Institute. Additionally , Advocate has been involved in leading this assessment work as an active member of the Steering Committee, providing financial support to the Alliance again in 2020. The priority areas selected by The Alliance include social and structural determinants of health, access to care, mental health and substance use disorders, chronic health conditions, in jury including violence , and maternal/fetal health. All participating hospitals selected some of the priorities to address in the areas served. There are multiple work groups addressing the priority areas and Advocate staff serve on most of the work groups . 2017-2019 Collaborative Assessment and Health Improvement Plan Partners As previously mentioned, Advocate utilizes partnerships as a strong component of all community health initiatives. The following chart shows the local health department(s) and other community organizations w ith wh om each Advocate hospital partnered in needs assessment and community health improvement plan ning for the 2017 -2019 CHNA. Hospital 2017-2019 Collaborative Assessment/ Health Improvement Plan Partners Advocate BroMenn McLean County Joint Assessment Health Department, Hospitals, United Way , Community Based Organizations (CB0s) Advocate Christ Alliance for Health Equity Chicago Department of Public Health, Cook County Health Department, 4 Regional Health Departments, 37 Hospitals, 100+ Stakeholders/CBOs Advocate Condell Lake County IPLAN Health Department, Hospitals, CBOs Advocate Eureka Tri-County Health Department I PLAN ; Tri-County CHNA Peoria, Tazewell and Woodford Health Departments, Hospitals, CBOs Advocate Good Samaritan DuPage County Health Department IPLAN Health Department, Hospitals, CBOs Advocate Good Shepherd McHenry County IPLAN Collaborative; Lake County Health Department IPLAN; Healthier Barrington Coalition Study Health Departments, Hospitals, CBOs, Mental Health Board 35 | P a g e Advocate Illinois Masonic Alliance for Health Equity Chicago Department of Public Health, Cook County Health Department, 4 Regional Health Departments, 37 Hospitals, 100+ Stakeholders/CBOs Advocate Lutheran General Alliance for Health Equity ; Healthier Des Plaines Collaborative; Healthier Niles Collaborati ve; Healthier Park Ridge Collaborative; Hanul/LGH Collaborative Assessment Chicago Department of Public Health, Cook County Health Department, 4 Regional Health Departments, 37 Hospitals, 100+ Stakeholders/ CBOs , Healthier Des Plaines, Niles and Park Ridge members Advocate Sherman Kane County IPLAN Collaborative ; McHenry County IPLAN Collaborative Health Departments, Hospitals, CBOs , Mental Health Board Advocate South Suburban Alliance for Health Equity Chicago Department of Public Health, Cook County Health Department, 4 Regional Health Departments, 37 Hospitals, 100+ Stakeholders/CBOs Advocate Trinity Alliance for Health Equity Chicago Department of Public Health, Cook County Health Department, 4 Regional Health Departments, 37 Hospitals, 100+ Stakeholders/CBOs Other Community Benefits In addition to the provision of programs and services to address access and health inequitie s, Advocate also devotes considerable staff and resources to other efforts that benefit the community and that align with the reporting categories of the Illinois Community Benefits Act. Training Future Health Professionals. To further the tradition of providing medical education to undergraduate and graduate medical students, nursing students and students in other health professions, Advocate has developed long -term academic affiliations with all major universities in the Chi cago metropolitan area for the education and training of students in undergraduate medical education (UME), graduate medical education (GME), nursing undergraduate and graduate education and in numerous other allied health professional fields. Medical Education (Undergraduate Medical Education [UME]/Graduate Medical Education [GME]/Post -Graduate [CME] Medical Education. The Advocate Medical Education Department's mission is to train the next generation of physicians through undergraduate (UME) a nd graduate medical education (GME), and to continue the development of Advocate physicians through continuing medical education (CME). As one of the largest providers of primary medical education in Illinois, there were 1,387 medical student rotations com pleted and 591 residents and fellows who received hands -on training in 2020 at Advocate's four academic medical centers \u2014Advocate BroMenn, Advocate Christ, Advocate Illinois Masonic and Advocate Lutheran General. 36 | P a g e Advocate is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) to provide continuing medical education (CME) for physicians. Advocate's CME program provides professional development through year -round scheduling and pl anning of accredited courses, seminars and meetings for Advocate and non -Advocate physicians and health care professionals in the region. Advocate's medical staff share their expertise through grand rounds, mortality and morbidity conferences, and journal clubs \u2014as well as single activities addressing a variety of clinical and research topics. In 2020, Advocate hosted 2,555 hours of accredited education to 32,602 participants, of which 20,714 were physicians. Due to the pandemic, most education was provided virtually which expanded our reach to a broader audience across the Advocate system. Nursing Education. Undergraduate and graduate (APN/NP/management) nursing education occurs at ten Advocate hospitals , support centers, many Advocate Medical Group sites and Advocate Home Health -Hospice . Notably, eight Advocate hospitals have earned Magnet Recognition from the American Nurse Credentialing Center (ANCC), including Advocate Children's, Advocate Condell, Advocate Christ, Advocate Good Samaritan, Advocate Good Shepherd, Advocate Illinois Masonic, Advocate Lutheran General and Advocate Sherman. Magnet status represents hospital -wide teamwork and dedication to creating a positive environment, which helps attract the best physicians and nurses, resulting in better overall patient care. Allied Health Education . Advocate is committed to teaching students in a broad range of specialties. These students come from local universities and colleges with whom Advocate has contracted to provide education. Students are provided a clinical environment in which to learn in over twent y health care disciplines/fields, including, but not limited to: pharmaceutical; cardio diagnostics; cardiac rehabilitation; radiology, nuclear medicine, MRI and X -ray; radiation therapy; exercise physiology; physical, occupational, (dentistry is only available through Advocate Illinois Masonic). Several Advocate hospitals provide emergency medical tech nician (EMT) education from basic through paramedic level. In fact, some of these Advocate facilities serve as the lead hospital in their counties/service areas, providing education, standardization of protocols of care among all hospitals (non -Advocate in cluded) and EMS responders, and direction of county -wide emergency medical services in response to community -based, mass injury/casualty disasters. Multiple Advocate system and hospital departments also provide learning environments for undergraduate and g raduate students in Public Health and Health Information Management. Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE) . Advocate's spiritual leaders oversee a nationally accredited C PE program. Supervising over 200 student units each year, the program is the largest in t he country in an integrated health care system, providing opportunities for 37 | P a g e seminary students, chaplains and local faith leaders to grow and develop self -awareness and spiritual care ministry skills. Vocational Education to High School Students. Several Advocate hospitals provide experiential learning to area high school students that are on an educational track to a health care career. These students receive credit towards graduation in addition to helping them discern in which health c are area they wish to specialize. As an example, i n order to give Chicago Southside students better job opportunities, Advocate Trinity works with students from Chicago Vocational Career Academy, and South Shore and Julian High Schools . These students are rotated in hospital units to learn marketable job skills. Volunteer Services . As part of its community programs, Advocate engages community volunteers to strengthen hospital and community initiatives. These programs and opportunities are described below. Volunteers from the Community. Each year, volunteers from the community share their time and talents through service at Advocate's hospitals, Advocate Medical Group and Advocate at Home, and in their own way, further Advocate's commitment to providing excellent health care. In 20 20, most volunteers were limited to serving from January through mid -March due to Advocate's adherence to COVID -19 safety guidelines, which significantly reduced the hours they were able to devote to Advocate sites. Ev en still, Advocate staff managed 2,743 active community volunteers in 2020 that engaged patients, families and staff in a variety of activities, some of which were: providing information desk services to visitors ; clerical support to staff ; serving custome rs in hospital gift and resale shops; offering compassionate concern to patients and their loved ones in multiple hospital areas , such as the Emergency Department, Intensive Care Unit, Surgery Waiting Room, Post -Anesthesia Care and Nursery Intensive Care U nits; assisting with community health screenings and blood drive events; providing cheerful service to patients by delivering flowers, mail and newspapers; and providing support services in the hospital that have libraries and/or wellness centers. Volunt eers from the community also give their time and talents to various other program s and fundraising activities. Members of Advocate 's hospital auxiliaries plan and engage in fundraising efforts to support not only services in the hospital but also community -focused programs and services. Students from the community volunteer their time to taking care of children in the Pediatric Developmental Center located on Advocate Illinois Masonic 's campus so that parents can meet with the center's staff to learn the sk ills necessary to work with their children with special needs so they can reach their full potential. The Hearts for Hope group at Advocate Children's \u2014Oak Lawn is comprised of grateful parents, concerned families and caring community members who support the mission of the hospital. The volunteers ensure they have a presence in the hospital by positively impacting family -centered care, as well as working to raise funds and awareness through philanthropic events and activities benefiting Advocate Children's . 38 | P a g e Advocate Associates Volunteering in the Community. Advocate team members (employees) and physicians are encouraged to donate to, volunteer at and help raise funds for community initiatives. Advocate promotes and supports team member, physician and hospital participation in four company -sponsored walks for multiple health -related, not - for-profit organiza tions, including the American Heart Association (AHA Heart Walk), American Cancer Society (Making Strides Against Breast Cancer), Alzheimer's Association (Walk to End Alzheimer's) and the March of Dimes (March for Babies). In 2020, due to the COVID -19 pand emic, these walks were held virtually with 1,324 Advocate team members registered in the annual local fundraisers and $214,390 in charitable contributions raised to support these partner organizations . Advocate was designated by the American Heart Associat ion as the #2 Heart Walk fundraising health care company in the nation and the #1 health care company in the Midwest in 2020 . In addition, Advocate's associates and physicians generously support multiple local community organizations, programs and initiati ves, including some of Advocate's own system -wide and hospital -based community health programs . In 20 20, Advocate associates, nurses and physicians contributed nearly $1.2M through the annual Advocate Aurora Give Well Campaign. Advocate associates devote work time volunteering on dozens of community boards, committees, councils, task forces and coalitions, using their talents to support a variety of community -based organiza tions. An example of associate volunteerism is Advocate Sherman's Director of Service Excellence and Population Health participation in leading the Alignment for Collaborative Education (ACE) . The Director serves as a member of the ACE Operating Board. The collaborative is focused on supporting public school strategies that promote student achievement to assist Elgin area children in becoming resilient, healthy and productive members of society . Advocate Good Samaritan's Vice President of Support Operation s and the President of Medical Staff devote time to serve on the DuPage Health Coalition's board \u2014DuPage Health coalition is an organization that links uninsured and undocumented individuals to primary and specialty healthcare and insurance. Yet another example of associate volunteerism is Advocate Good Shepherd 's representative that serves on the Board of Directors of the Northeastern Illinois Agency on Aging . The agency funds state /federal grants to local community senior service s providers that serve the area 's increasing senior population. System and Site Accountability for Community Health Advocate has taken several steps to assure system and site accountability for and alignment of community health improvement efforts . These actions include developing a governance and departmental infrastructure at the sites and system levels to lead and support efforts, and to include Advocate's ample clinical expertise in developing and sustaining evidence -based programs that measurabl y impa ct/improve community health. Engaging System Board in Support of Community Health Vision. As the function accountable for Advocate's system -wide CHNA process , CHNA Report and Implementation Plan development and execution, as well as community benefits regulatory reporting, the 39 | P a g e Community Health Department provides updates at least annually to the Advocate Health Care Network Board. The Advocate Health Care Network Board is r esponsible for the adoption of community health strategy . Establishing a Department of Community Health. Advocate established a Community Health Department in late 2015 and the department was fully staffed and operating by January 2016. During 2016, hospital -specific community health department budgets were develo ped to support the hospitals' plans to implement program strategies . Community Health staff salaries, annual contracted data access costs for Conduent -Healthy Communities Institute and costs to participate in the Alliance for Health Equity collaborative were budgeted at the syste m level and in place for 2017 through 2020. In 2020, the Community Health department contracted with Metopio, a Chicago -based company offering a state -of-the-art CHNA data and reporting tool. Training on Metopio is planned in 202 1 and the tool will be used to support Advocate's CHNA process for the 2020 -2022 CHNA cycle. Advocate's system level Community Health Department also contracted with an outside vendor in 2018 to use a well -respected , secure and time -efficient web -based sof tware for tracking and reporting community benefits expenditures. While very similar to the strategy developed previously, Advocate's Community Health Department team members are even more deliberately working to implement and sustain programs focused on health equity in alignment with the overall A dvocate Aurora community health vision and strategy adopted in 2019. Expand ed Role of Governing Councils in Community Health. Community Health is strongly integrated into Advocate 's governance structures. Community Health Councils , comprised of community experts and hospital leaders , have been developed at each of the Advocate hospital s. These councils are co -led by the hospital community health leader and a hospital Governing Counci l member. A minimum of 50% of the council members for the 201 9 CHNA Report and 20 20-2022 Community Health Implementation Plan cycle s were community representatives with a focus on people who represented underserved and vulnerable populations. Dependent on the hospital, t he councils met three or four times during the year. Hospital community health staff analyzed and presented primary a nd secondary community health data to the hospitals' Community Health Councils. The council members identified the hospital service areas' significant health needs, subsequently employing consensus -based , priority -setting processes to determine the needs u pon which to focus. As part of the prioritization process, the councils scanned hospital and community challenges and assets, as well as potential partnerships with other organizations that might result in larger health improvement impact. The 201 7-2019 CHNA cycle data assessment results and recommendations for health improvement priorities were presented to the full hospital Governing Council for endorsement. Once the health improvement priorities and strategies were approved by the hospital Govern ing Councils, the y were presented to the Advocate Health Care Network Board 40 | P a g e for approval . Following the merger of Advocate (IL) with Aurora Health (WI), the CHNA approval process for the Illinois hospitals continued to engage t he hospital Governing Councils for approval at the hospital level . However, system oversight of community health strategy was transitioned from t he Mission and Spiritual Care Committee of the Board to the A dvocate Health Care Network (AHCN) Board following the merger . The AHCN board is charged with review and approval of the Advocate Community Benefits Plan , CHNA Reports and Implementation Plans . Engaging System Clinical Service Lines to Expand Their Focus on C ommunity Health . Advocate is viewed as a leader in the population health management arena. An early adopter of managing care across populations, Advocate has significant success improving health outcomes while decreasing or maintaining cost of care delivery. Advocate's Community Health Department has intentionally aligned with Advocate population health leaders and Advocate service lines. This alignment assures that members of the communities Advocate serves and our patients receive community -based interventions, as well as education and programming that aligns with their health needs. Many of the examples of education and programming aligned with population health and service line development have already been discussed in other sections of this plan . All Advocate hospi tals, for example, are participating in local community behavioral health and substance abuse collaboratives, following Advocate's integrated approach to implementation. Several examples of the Behavioral Health initiatives are provided below. Warm Hand off Program. Four AAH hospitals \u2014Advocate Condell, Advocate Good Shepherd, Advocate Sherman and Advocate Good Samaritan \u2014work in partnership with Gateway Foundation, a community -based addiction medicine treatment provider, to implement an evidence -based model to screen and assess patients coming to the hospital for substance use . The Warm Handoff program integrates a full -time credentialed engagement specialist employed by Gateway Foundation into the hospital ED team to assess and counsel patients with substance use disorder, and then assist with linking them to treatment. A Gateway Foundation -employed recovery coach on the t eam provides support to patients as they transition into treatment. In 2020, through the Warm Handoff program, 874 patients were screened by the Gateway engagement specialist; 472 patients were connected to treatment and 81 patients started treatment. Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT). Despite the pandemic, in July 2020 , Advocate Good Shepherd launched the prescribing of buprenorphine upon discharge from the ED for patients with substance use disorder seeking Medication Assisted Treatment . A total of three patients were linked to community -based MAT in 2020 . Ending the Silence. Advocate Good Samaritan partnered with NAMI DuPage to provide Ending the Silence to middle and high school students. Ending the Silence is a one -hour class that aims to destigmatize mental illness and create awareness around mental health. 41 | P a g e Due to the pandemic , restrictions on in -person classes and learning, Ending the Silence was provided virtually to students. As a result, over 150 students received Ending the Silence education in 2020. V. Communities Served Service Area Advocate's primary service area is comprised of the Chicago Metropolitan Six -County Area , including Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will counties . (On July 1, 2020, Advocate's two central Illinois hospitals, Advocate BroMenn and Eureka, transitioned ownership to Carle Health . As a result, the following narrative and data updates exclude the central Illinois service area narrative and data that was included in previous years. ) Demographic Characteristics - Chicago Metropolitan Six -County Area Population . The Chicago Metropolitan counties with the greatest population are Cook (includes city of Chicag o) at over 5 M, DuPage at 952K, Lake at 718K, and Will at 696K. Kane and McHenry counties are less densely populated at 498K and 334K, respectively . Chicago Metropolitan Six-County Area - 2020 Actual & 2026 Projected Total Population County 2020 Population 2026 Population Cook County 5,099,579 5,057,875 DuPage Chicago Six -County Area population will decline slightly from 2021 to 2026 , with the population expected to decrease by about 35,000 people by 2026 . The individual county growth rates range from -0.8% in Cook County to 1.1% in Kane County.
