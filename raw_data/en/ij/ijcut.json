The prevalence of ASD, most especially in the United States, but also elsewhere, appears to have increased dramatically in the last 40 years. (The most current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] estimates for the US are that 1 in 68 children is identified with an autism spectrum disorder; for boys: 1 in 42.) Some voices, however, insist that this apparent increase is due to better detection techniques and broader awareness; while more than one study has suggested that the increase can not possibly be attributed to these factors alone. Then there are the complex (and controversial) questions of contributing factors: genetic predispositions versus environmental toxicity factors such as the mercurial preservative thimerosal that is widely used in vaccines. As a phenomenon of our current moment in history, the broad examination of ASD, its consciousness and controversies, as a symptom and as a riddle, can undoubtedly be a useful entry point for discerning something about the world in which we are living. And yet, lest we become too theoretical, there is also the ever-present reality of the individual human being to consider. For parents and grandparents, teachers and caregivers, doctors and therapists, this is the first consideration. And this is the focus of our program. From a purely therapeutic standpoint, and in the presence of a unique living individual human being, these broader questions, disputes, and controversies can take a backseat to the utterly singular person before us. Here the tools and insights of anthroposophical spiritual science are not merely useful but ultimately necessary.How can we use these insights to meet the one before us with an even greater love and out of a deeper wisdom? | | | | Sophia Institute offers a variety of programs, courses, publications and other resources to anyone interested in Anthroposophy and Waldorf/Steiner inspired education.
