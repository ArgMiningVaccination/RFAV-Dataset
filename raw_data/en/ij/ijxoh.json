For, indeed, that's all who ever have. \" This quote has special meaning for our UHCOP as our multifaceted teams continue to strive to achieve our many goals set forth by our new \"Vision 2020\" strategic plan (see details of our UHCOP Vision 20/20 at www.uh.edu/pharmacy/about-us/Vision-2020/index.php). Our new strategic plan will indeed take us beyond several important crossroads in the coming years. As always, this edition of Interactions is replete with excellent examples of our College's many teams of caring people working together on many exciting and impactful projects. Our UHCOP Dean's Advisory Council (DAC), ambassadors, faculty, staff, students and UH administration are working very hard to bring together funding that will provide a new state- of-the-art Pharmacy Building and additional new initiatives that are crucial for the future of our great program. Our faculty and students are reaching out to other Texas Medical Center (TMC) healthcare colleagues, such as the Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Women's University to form early healthcare team synergies via multidisciplinary clinical programs that will translate to improvements in patient care (see the article concerning our LACE project). Our UHCOP student teams have formed the first Texas Student Chapter of the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy and the first UHCOP Student Political Action Committee (PAC). These two student led initiatives will be very important for the future of our profession as we continue to develop new approaches to improve healthcare delivery. As I admire some of the great work of our faculty, staff, students and alumni highlighted in this edition of Interactions , I continue to feel very fortunate to have the opportunity to be associated with such an incredible group of \"caring (and talented) people\"! Dr. Mead had to have organizations such as our UHCOP in mind when she wrote, \"Never believe that a few caring people can't change the world. For, indeed, that's all who ever have. \" The UHCOP remains totally committed to producing the highest quality professional pharmacists to meet the health care needs for our patients in the great state of Texas and beyond. This will provide a terrific foundation for our program as we continue our \"Vision 2020 journey\" . F.

The University of Houston is an EEO/AA institution. University of Houston College of Pharmacy 3 COLLEGE NEWS The University of Houston System Board of Regents recently took a bold step to address changing healthcare needs by unanimously approving the creation of a Health Science Center at UH in January 2013. With UH programs in the health sciences as one of the primary drivers in its move to Tier One status, the board agreed that the university must further develop these resources to achieve the next level of success. In addition to the College of Pharmacy's programs, UH offers a wealth of health science programs, including undergraduate and graduate academic programs to prepare students for health-related careers; research programs addressing health- related scientific, engineering and policy issues; and clinical programs directly involved in patient care. \"The creation of a Health Science Center at UH, which would include patient care, workforce training, research and community outreach, is critical to the economic and social well-being of the region and state, \" said UH System Chancellor and UH President Renu Khator . \"With numerous academic, research and clinical programs in the health sciences, our university plays a vital role in meeting these needs. Formal creation of this Health Science Center brings a new level of synergy and focus that will broaden the impact of our research and education programs, and provide a clear point of access for the community. \" As funding for higher education becomes increasingly scarce, universities must develop alternative means of securing resources. A Health Science Center would put UH in a position to increase tuition dollars through expanded enrollment in professional training programs, federal dollars through pioneering research programs and third-party payments for clinical services. Implementation of the Affordable Care Act, in particular, will provide an influx of new resources into the health care arena. The university is seeking approval of the center from the Texas Legislature during its current session, with the official launch of the center projected for fiscal-year 2014. - Lisa Merkl, University Communications UH Regents Back Plan for Health Science Center Designation The UH College of Pharmacy Dean's Advisory Council recently added several members as alumni and friends respond to the call for advocates and allies to help catapult the college and university to Tier One status.

Tucker , Pharm.D., BCNSP, and her colleagues at Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center (MEDVAMC) recently were named among the inaugural recipients of the 2013 Clinical Nutrition Team of Distinction Award by the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN). The award identifies and elevates the stature of interdisciplinary nutrition care within an institution or agency and externally in local communities. Clinical nutrition teams, as defined for this award, consist of an identified interdisciplinary group of practitioners with a member from each of four disciplines: dietetics, medicine, nursing and pharmacy. The Nutrition Support Team participates in nutrition support rounds, formulary selection, policy revision, research, educational development, and development and implementation of new and updated guidelines. The members also round daily on parenteral nutrition patients, assist with ordering, and work to reduce metabolic and infectious complications. \"Pharmacists on nutrition support teams perform many roles, including development of patient-centered nutrition support care plans, fluid and electrolyte management, identification and management of drug- nutrient interactions, and necessary monitoring to prevent complications associated with nutrition therapy, \" said Tucker, who also recently was installed as chair-elect of ASPEN's Pharmacy Practice Section. \"We also are active in assuring the safe compounding of parenteral nutrition, developing policies and procedures for nutrition support therapies, education, and integration of research into clinical practice. \" Tucker's colleagues on the team are physician Maria honored by this recognition of our interdisciplinary clinical nutrition practice, \" said MEDVAMC Director Adam C. Walmus, M.H.A., M.A., FACHE. \"I am extremely proud our staff members support each other and are focused on our mission to provide the highest quality health care possible to our veterans. \" Founded in 1976, ASPEN is an interdisciplinary organization of dietitians, nurses, pharmacists, physicians, scientists, students and other health professionals from every facet of nutrition support clinical practice, research and education. \"The Clinical Nutrition Team of Distinction Award honors those hard-working teams who are at their patients' side each and every day, \" said ASPEN President Tom Jaksic, M.D., Ph.D. \"Exceptional patient care is the heart and soul of everything we do. \" Tucker also has become the first faculty member from the college to be appointed to a national specialty council of the Board of Pharmacy Specialties. Tucker's appointment is a three-year term on the BPS Nutrition Support Speciality Council, which is responsible for making recommendations regarding standards and other requirements for certification and recertification of pharmacists; developing and administering examinations; and evaluating the qualifications of individuals recommended for certification or recertification. Certification is a voluntary process by which a pharmacist's education, experience, knowledge and skills in a particular practice area are confirmed beyond what is required for licensure. Nearly 13,000 pharmacists in the U.S. hold board certification from BPS, which was established in 1976 as an autonomous division of the APhA. UHCOP faculty member Anne Tucker, far right, is one of two pharmacists on a interprofessional Nutrition Support team at the Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Houston.

A staff member of the college for six years, her primary role is to support faculty members, students and staff in the use of technology in the classroom and the design of quality learning. Mauthner is a two-time Cougar, having earned a master's degree in Occupational Technology and a bachelor's degree in Information Systems from the College of Technology. In addition to serving in a second term on the UH Staff Council, Mauthner has volunteered her time for a variety of university-wide initiatives for several years, including the Cougar First Impressions new-student ambassador program and the UH March of Dimes Walk. She previously served as chair of the UHCOP Staff Advisory Council, which is similar in function but not affiliated with UH body. During her two-year term in the position, Mauthner served as college coordinator for such campus projects as the Sock and Blanket Drive for Houston's homeless shelters. Mauthner Among '25 for 25' Honored During UH Staff Council Anniversary MauthnerUH College of Pharmacy pharmacology faculty members Aditi Marwaha , Ph.D., M.Ed. ('07), assistant professor, were honored by the University of Houston in April for excellence in teaching and mentorship. Marwaha was among the recipients of the UH Teaching Excellence Award for Instructor/Clinical level faculty by the UH Office of the Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs & Provost. A past recipient of the college's Teaching Excellence Award and the Rho Chi Teaching Award, she has taught and coordinated several Pharm.D. courses as well as an undergraduate course for non-science majors since joining the faculty seven years ago. Marwaha was recognized by UH for her success in the classroom as a result of embracing new teaching methods and instructional aids to increase student engagement and provide an active learning environment, including use of audience-response devices, virtual classrooms and interactive, web-based content; eagerly inviting student and peer feedback on her presentations; and inspiring students to consider becoming teachers. \"When students get personal attention and feedback from their teacher, they get motivated to do better, \" Marwaha said. \"They feel good that, in a class of 300 students, my teacher remembers what I do. \" One student noted, \"Dr. Marwaha's teaching is about more than just knowledge of the subject; it is also the kindness, consideration and respect she shows each and every day. \" Tejada-Simon was honored as the inaugural recipient of the Early Faculty Award for Mentoring Undergraduate Research from the UH Office of Undergraduate Research. Tejada-Simon has mentored nine undergraduate students in her lab since joining the faculty in 2008, with seven peer-reviewed publications and more than two dozen presentations with at least one undergraduate coauthor. Several of her undergraduate students have received competitive extramural travel awards to present at major conferences, support at the local level through UH and international undergraduate research scholarship/fellowship programs, and/or local and national recognition awards for the high quality of their presentations. \"To acquire research skills, a broad laboratory and scientific experience will allow a student to increase not only his/her talents and confidence, but also be more competitive in the global marketplace and perhaps open his/her eyes to the pursuit of graduate studies, \" she said. Students in her lab are not only required to complete training in research ethics, safety, animal welfare and basic lab research techniques, but also participate in sessions on scientific writing, effective presentation skills and teaching methods. \"MariVi views each student that works with her as a diamond in the rough - to be pressed hard, nurtured, criticized when appropriate, gently and empathetically encouraged when needed - all with the objective of creating a lifelong learner skilled in the art of discovery, regardless of their chosen future pursuit, \" noted Doug Eikenburg , Ph.D., associate professor and chair of the college's Department of Pharmacological & Pharmaceutical Sciences.

In its 2012 revision of the Beers Criteria guidelines, the American Geriatrics Society noted that \"many (potentially inappropriate medications) continue to be prescribed and used as first-line treatment for the most vulnerable of older adults. \" Separately, numerous studies have linked depression with cognitive impairment in older adults, but the degree of impact that anticholinergics have on patients with depression is not known. Under a nearly $1 million grant from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Aparasu's four-year project will examine clinically rich Minimum Data Set-linked Medicare claims data from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Expected to incorporate medical data from more than 2 million patients, the project will be one of the largest studies of its kind. \"Ultimately, the goal is to improve the quality of life of geriatric patients, \" Aparasu said. \"By determining the health risks and impacts associated with anticholinergic drugs in this vulnerable population, our study will provide further evidence to help practitioners in their risk- benefit decision-making process. \" The study will focus on drugs with \"clinically significant\" anticholinergic activity, as classified in the Anticholinergic Drug Scale (ADS) system developed by co-investigator Ryan Carnahan , Pharm.D., M.S., BCPP , clinical assistant professor at the University of Iowa College of Public Health. UHCOP associate professors Hua Chen , Ph.D., M.D., and Michael Johnson , Ph.D., also are co-investigators on the project. \"When I talk to clinicians, more often than not a large proportion of them have never heard of the Beers list; it's well known in the world of geriatrics, but generalists and other specialties don't necessarily know about it, \" Carnahan said. \"Some drugs have anticholinergic activity that is not recognized by clinicians, since it's not their mechanism of action. \"In all cases, clinicians may not be aware of the risks, the magnitude of risk may not be well characterized, or they choose to accept the risks because they think the benefit of treatment could outweigh the risks. \" Professor Rajender Aparasu, center, and faculty co-investigators Hua Chen and Michael Johnson have received federal funding to determine the risks of anticholingeric use in nursing home patients with depression. Jerry Powers/UH photo Nanoparticle Functions as Contrast Agent, Vehicle for Gene Malavosklish \"Liz\" Bikram , Ph.D., assistant professor of pharmaceutics, a U.S. patent for an iron-oxide \"superparamagnetic\" nanoparticle designed to enhance the diagnostic imaging of tumors and deliver anti-tumor drug or gene therapies. Bikram developed the dual- function, ultrasmall nanoparticle as a biomimetic contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnostics and nonviral gene therapy delivery system to target early stage and metastatic cancers. The nanoparticle platform, which also incorporates an inert layer of gold coating the nanoparticle, offers opportunities for broad application in cancer diagnosis and care, especially in detecting and treating ovarian and breast cancers. As with all forms of cancer (and diseases in general), early detection is critical to survival rates. Ovarian cancers are especially difficult to detect, partly due to non-specificity of symptoms and the limitations of current imaging tools. According to the American Cancer Society, only about 15 percent of all ovarian cancers are detected in the early stages when five-year survival rates run as high as 92 percent. Assistant Professor Liz Bikram displays a sample of her patented iron-oxide nanoparticle for enhanced diagnostic imaging and delivery of therapeutics.

Tikunova , Ph.D., may yield clues into how mutations in a key cardiac protein can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), one of the most common forms of heart disease. Tikunova's exploration into the molecular mechanisms of DCM is supported by a new three-year, $451,166 grant from the National Institutes of Health's National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. In DCM, the heart's main pumping chamber (the left ventricle) becomes enlarged and weakened, reducing its ability to adequately pump blood to the rest of the body. DCM is a life- threatening condition that can lead to the development of blood clots, arrhythmia, congestive heart failure and sudden death. It can affect individuals of any age, including children, as well as many breeds of dogs. Although the causes for all DCMs have not been identified, known causes include congenital heart disease, toxins, thyroid disease, inflammatory conditions, infections, severe long-standing hypertension, radiation and hereditary factors. Up to 40 percent of DCM cases are believed to be caused by mutations in cytoskeletal and sarcomeric proteins, but how these mutations lead to the development of the disease is unclear. Tikunova's project will explore the role of mutations that alter calcium sensitivity of the cardiac troponin C in the development of cardiomyopathies. Cardiac troponin C (cTnC) is a regulatory protein, whose calcium-binding function is integral to cardiac- muscle contraction. The cTnC mutation was engineered to desensitize cTnC to calcium and was introduced into mouse myocardium via gene targeting technology in order to recreate the phenotype of DCM. \"Our goal is to gain a better understanding of how mutations of regulatory proteins affect molecular signaling of calcium- binding and exchange, which impacts the heart muscle's normal function, \" Tikunova said. \"This engineered cTnC mutation results in reduced calcium sensitivity and a faster rate of calcium dissociation from thin filaments in the heart muscle. If our knock-in mouse model then develops DCM, we can demonstrate a link between calcium desensitization of cardiac muscle and the development of DCM. \" Bond, Knoll Investigate Key Cell Types in Development of Asthma With $430,000 in support from a special grant program of the National Institutes of Health, UHCOP faculty researchers Richard A. Bond , Ph.D. ('88), and Brian J. Knoll , Ph.D., are attempting to zero-in on the critcal cell type within the airway system where activation triggers inflammation and other deleterious effects on the airway that are considered hallmarks of asthma. In their decade-long quest to develop safer, improved medications for asthma, Bond and Knoll have been investigating the role and mechanism of the beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR) in the development of the disease. \"Our research has shown that chronic use of beta2-AR inverse agonists or genetic deletion of the beta2-AR in mouse model of asthma produced broad anti-inflammatory effects in the airways, including reversal of excess mucous production by airway epithelial cells, \" Bond said. Funded by the special NIH Director's Bridge Award program, their current research phase seeks to determine whether the epithelium is in fact a target for B2AR signaling, which components of the asthma phenotype are due to receptor activation in specific lung or stem cells, and the role of receptor inhibitors in mediating the pro-asthmatic effects. The work of Bond, Knoll and their collaborators also has lead to a new multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study being conducted by Baylor College of Medicine, Duke University and Washington University.

Garey's paper entitled \"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study to assess the ability of rifaximin to prevent recurrent diarrhoea (sic) in patients with Clostridium difficile infection\" was selected in September as the 2012 Impact Paper of the Year by the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists (his second award from SIDP). CDI has become the most common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and healthcare-related infection in the developed world. Published in the December 2011 Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy , the paper was coauthored by University DuPont , M.D., SLEH/UTSPH/ Baylor College of Medicine. The paper detailed Garey's project into the effectiveness of using a rifaximin \"chaser\" following standard anti-CDI antibiotic therapy to prevent recurrent diarrhea in patients. According to the randomized, controlled study, patients given rifaximin had approximately 50 percent lower rates of recurrent diarrhea compared to patients given placebo. Selected as a Fellow of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) in 2012, Garey represents the ASHP on a joint panel of panel of CDI experts currently updating the U.S. treatment guidelines on behalf of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA). In addition, three papers by Garey and his colleagues recently were cited in the updated U.S. guidelines for antimicrobial prophylaxis in surgery. The new guidelines by experts from ASHP, IDSA, SHEA and the Surgical Infection Society appear in the American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy 's February 2013 issue. Garey's latest recognition follows his citations in the most recent guideline updates for CDI by the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases and for invasive candidiasis by the IDSA. Associate Professor Kevin Garey, pictured with his infectious diseases fellows, has achieved national recognition with a recent appointment to an expert panel as well as an award and several citations for his research publications.Matthew White/UH photo A UHCOP faculty member's study of Texas pharmacists' intention to use a new online database designed to prevent prescription drug diversion and abuse was recognized with the Postgraduate Best Podium Presentation Award at the 2013 American Pharmacists Association Annual Meeting March 1-4 in Los Angeles. Marc Fleming , Ph.D., M.P.H., R.Ph., received the award from the APhA's Academy of Pharmacy Research & Science's Economic, Social and Administrative Sciences Section. Fleming's presentation, entitled \"Using the Theory of Planned Behavior to predict pharmacists' intention to utilize a Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) database, \" was based on his dissertation work at The University of Texas at Austin College of Pharmacy. The web-based PDMP portal called Prescription Access Texas that was launched by the Texas Department of Public Safety last fall replaced the state's outdated fax-based manual system, which took 30-45 days for reports to be generated. The study employed the theory of planned behavior - a model incorporating psychological factors such as attitudes and perceived social influence to predict subjects' intention to pursue specific behaviors - to assess pharmacists' intention to use the new online system. Fleming said validation of the theory's applicability offers PDMP system administrators and policymakers guidance for future initiatives to address provider attitudes and other factors toward the system, develop best practices to preserve workflow efficiency for providers, or even make modifications to the system itself. \"I believe technologies such as this, if used effectively, can save lives, \" Fleming said. \"The overall goal of my research is to increase awareness of the technology; identify potential areas for improvement, either in the functionality of the system or in provider education; and to reduce or eliminate barriers to providers' willingness or ability to use the system. \" FlemingFleming Nets APhA Award for Project on Drug Monitoring Program 12 University of Houston College of PharmacyStudent, Fellow Research Garners Abstract, Presentation Awards Senior Infectious Diseases Pharmacy Fellow Nicholas Beyda , Pharm.D., received travel awards from the American Society for Microbiology/Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA).

The new chapter's founders said they saw a need to raise awareness of the burgeoning field of managed care pharmacy, both as a career option and integral to today's health care environment, among members and fellow students. Members of the new affiliate also recognized the networking, educational and other benefits of being part of a national organization with more than 50 student chapters and approximately 6,000 total members nationwide. \"Our members are interested in learning about careers in business, management, industry and other nonconventional pharmacy careers outside of retail and clinical settings, and managed care complements these established goals, \" said student Rachel Eppinette , the 2012-13 chapter president. The affiliation provides an opportunity for members to challenge potential student and public misperceptions about managed care pharmacy, she said. \"Healthcare coverage is complex and the general public and students, including myself at one point, lump all types of coverage into a business purely out to make money and, by extension, only cause problems for customers, \" Eppinette said. \" After speaking with many pharmacists in managed care, my opinion definitely has changed: The goal of managed care is to find the safest and most economical way to provide health care for all. \" Hanna Brobovnyk , who helped lead the effort to establish the new chapter, said implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and other aspects of healthcare reform are expected to generate additional demand for the skills and knowledge of managed care pharmacists. \" As more people will be acquiring coverage with ACA, there will be a greater need for drug formulary management, insurance drug coverage and overall disease-drug education from the patient and healthcare providers, \" Brobovnyk said. NCPA Cougars Finish 2nd for National Student Chapter Honors The UH chapter of the National Community Pharmacists Association achieved its highest honor in October with its first runner-up finish in the national NCPA Student Chapter of the Year competition. Although the chapter fell shy of its goal, members of the UH chapter were nonetheless proud of the national recognition for their hard work during the previous year. \"Our chapter skyrocketed to its highest position ever due to the passion of our members, \" said Bobby Clay , who was the third consecutive UH student elected to the NCPA National Student Leadership Council and immediate past president of the UH chapter. \"The organization was basically extinct three years ago, but now is flourishing within our college because students have realized that independent pharmacy is alive and well. I had a vision for the chapter, and our members shared that vision to make real changes in the community and change the perception of independent community pharmacy. \" Highlights of the chapter's activities included embarking on its inaugural \"Texas road trip\" to independent pharmacies around the state; launching a twice-yearly newsletter; and hosting networking events and presentations by independent pharmacy owners covering such topics as political advocacy and financial planning. In addition to the chapter honors, Danielle Stifter was among the Outstanding Chapter Member recognized at the 114th NCPA Annual Convention. \"It has been a privilege working with the other officers in implementing the Professional Development Series, pharmacy and legislature visits, and our newsletter, \" Stifter said. \"We want to provide students with the tools to network with community pharmacists, develop professional skills necessary to own a pharmacy, and become more involved in advocacy. \" Stifter National NCPA student leaders Bobby Clay, left, and Ezequiel Medina, right, and faculty advisor Lynn Simpson display the certificates of recognition for chapter and individual service at the NCPA National Convention in October.photo courtesy of Ezequiel Medina 14 University of Houston College of Pharmacy International Day Celebrates 20th Year UH College of Pharmacy's annual International Day, which serves the dual purpose of celebrating the rich cultural heritage of its students and helping generate start-up funds for each new first-year class of Pharm.D. students, recently marked its 20th year. Hallmarks of the event for the entire campus include samples of ethnic cuisine, live musical and dance performances, and a fashion show displaying traditional dress representing cultures from around the world. ASP Earns Leadership Award from UH Division of Student Affairs The UH Chapter of the American Pharmacists Association- Academy of Student Pharmacists was recognized with the Most Improved Student Organization Award for the 2012-13 academic year at the UH Campus Leaders Reception in April. Presented by the UH Division of Student Affairs, the award recognizes registered student organizations that have made significant strides in improving membership and increasing engagement with the campus community. \"I know I speak for everyone when I say that the leaders of APhA-ASP could not be more proud to be part of such an outstanding organization, \" said Rachel Harvey , 2012-13 chapter president. \"We have made incredible leaps this year, and are on track to soar next year under the leadership of (2013-14 President) Thuy Vo and her fellow officers. \" Highlights of ASP's campus activities during the 2012-13 academic year include organizing or participating in three major health fairs in which members provided a variety of wellness screenings, such as blood pressure checks and glucose screenings, as well as voter registration and educational presentations on a range of health topics. \"ASP always has been active in the community, but the students put a lot of effort and energy into being more visible and raising awareness about the college and the pharmacy profession among their fellow students, as well as UH faculty and staff during the past year, \" said Lynn Simpson , Pharm.D. ('97), clinical associate professor and ASP chapter co-advisor. In addition to the chapter honor, Pharm.D. students Osagie (Tony) Ohonba and Trang Tran were nominated for individual awards. Both were among the nominees in the Graduate Student Leader category, while Tran received a second nomination in the Outstanding Leadership category. In nominating Ohonba, fellow student Trung Kevin Tran cited Ohonba's leadership as class president and chair of the new UH Pharmacy Student PAC (see story on next page) as well as his volunteerism outside of pharmacy, including working with the Big Brothers Big Sisters organization. Tran was credited by Simpson for her leadership in patient care initiatives, including the wellness events at UH and across the Greater Houston area as ASP Patient Care Coordinator, and developing the project for chronic hepatitis B education/ management at HOPE Clinic (see story on page 22) .

With their election to 2012-13 SNPhA National Vice President and Regional Facilitator for Region IV, Jean and Garcia join a long list of UH students who serve as ambassadors for the college through volunteerism and service at the highest level of pharmacy organizations. A native of Baytown, Jean said he was inspired to seek a national leadership position at the encouragement of his chapters members and his desire for personal growth. \"One of the things I recognized immediately is that all of the members want to be 'doers'; the passion our members have for helping the community is contagious, \" Jean said of the UH chapter, which is one of the college's largest at 120 members. \"I also saw the leadership position as an opportunity to learn from others and mature by taking on the additional pressure and responsibility. \" Among Jean's duties are coordinating programming, such as the clinical skills competition, for the national and regional meetings and encouraging collaboration between individual chapters.\"Naturally, there's always going to be a certain amount of healthy competition among chapters and colleges, but it's important that we don't lose sight of the fact that we're all SNPhA members and future colleagues, \" Jean said. \"We need to help each other for the betterment of our profession, our patients and our communities. \" Describing herself as somewhat introverted and shy, Garcia said she pursued the regional position partly to challenge herself. She serves as a liaison between the national office and 11 chapters in her region, which includes reviewing monthly status reports and leading conference calls with chapter representatives. \"Getting out of my comfort zone has made me more confident in how I communicate, and I think this will help my patient counseling skills, \" Garcia said. Previously serving as UH chapter vice president, Garcia co-coordinated the first of what has become an annual SNPhA-Target Pharmacy community health fair with wellness screenings, counseling and education in predominately underserved areas of Houston. \"I love volunteering, so I plan to stay active after I graduate because SNPhA will always be in my heart and\" said Garcia, who also is encouraging chapters to increase their outreach and mentorship of pre-pharmacy students. UHCOP students Diana Garcia and Danny Jean are serving in regional and national offices of the Student National Pharmaceutical Association. Students Form PAC to Consolidate Advocacy on Common Interests A new student organization has taken the old adage of \"united we stand, divided we fall\" to heart by focusing the political advocacy energies of UH College of Pharmacy students. The UH Student PharmPAC comprises representatives from each student organization affiliated with the college, with Osagie (Tony) Ohonba serving as chair and founder. \"As far as I know, it's the first of its kind among colleges of pharmacy across the country, \" said Ohonba, who also serves as class president for the Pharm.D. Class of 2015 and as a student member on the UHCOP Dean's Advisory Council. \"One day it sort of hit me that I'll be a pharmacist in two years, but there are decisions being made today that could have major, long-term effects on my profession, my career goals and my future patients. \"I don't think it's paranoia or an exaggeration to say that pharmacy faces threats from various factions at the state and national level, and we need to be informed, active and unafraid in fighting for our profession and our patients. \" Ohonba said the new organization will not collect dues, nor will it make campaign contributions to political candidates. It will, however, function as a sort of one-stop shop for keeping students informed about pharmacy-relevant developments in state and national government, policy opinions by allied professionals organizations, and the legislative process. In addition, Ohonba said he'd like to see the PAC coordinate email- and letter-writing campaigns to \"speak with one voice. \" \"As students, we sometimes get so bogged down in our workload that we don't always look at the long term, \" Ohonba said. \"I don't expect immediate results from this effort, but I believe we owe it to ourselves, future students and the profession to begin working together on issues and challenges of common interest. \" OhonbaVANA Health Fair DATE/LOCATION: Oct. 14, 2012, Memorial Hermann Southwest SERVICES/PATIENT IMPACT: 300+ blood pressure, glucose and cholesterol screenings PARTNERS: Vietnamese American Nurses Association, Memorial Hermann SouthwestBrookshire Brothers Health Fairs DATES/LOCATIONS: New Caney (Nov. 17), Magnolia (Nov. 10); Katy (Dec. 1); Dayton (Dec. 1) SERVICES/PATIENT IMPACT: 60+ blood pressure, glucose, diabetic foot exams, osteoporosis/bone densityCOMMUNITY OUTREACH In one of the most active semesters in UHCOP history, Pharm.D. students performed more than 2,300 seasonal flu immunizations and 3,000 screenings during the Fall 2012 semester throughout the Greater Houston area in collaboration with retail community pharmacies, nonprofit organization, health systems, fellow academic institutions and other community partners.

Despite being first recommended by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) more than four decades ago, mainstream integration of interprofessional education into the respective curricula of the primary health professions has made little progress. Guided by multiple IOM reports and an continuously growing body of evidence supporting the concept, the Interprofessional Education Collaborative (IPEC) comprising associations that represent academia in medicine, osteopathy, nursing, public health, dentistry and pharmacy was formed in 2009. In outlining the \"Core Competencies for Interprofessional Collaborative Practice\" in 2011, the IPEC affirmed its collective and respective obligation \"to prepare all health professions students for deliberately working together with the common goal of building a safer and better patient-centered and community/population oriented U.S. health care system. \" Interprofessional collaborations are not entirely new to UH College of Pharmacy, however. The college is one of the founding members of the Healthcare for the Homeless- Houston's HOMES Clinic, which has been successfully run by students from Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), the schools of Medicine and Public Health at the University of Texas, and UH for over a decade. The college also has participated in the annual Geriatric Interprofessional Student Competition organized by the UTHealth's Houston Geriatric Education Center for the past five years. With the past four years, however, UH College of Pharmacy has begun to aggressively pursue expanded interprofessional education initiatives with some of its academic partners. One such collaboration is with BCM's \"No Place Like Home\" program, one of the several Longitudinal Ambulatory Clinical Experience course tracks for its third-year medical students. In cooperation with Harris Health System, the program delivers in-home ambulatory care services by nurse practitioners and physicians to Houston-area geriatric patients who are predominately homebound due to mobility limitations typically resulting from comorbidities. The interprofessional education component of the program integrates pairs of BCM medical and UH pharmacy students into the healthcare team during the home visits. Following a pilot stage in spring 2012, UHCOP and BCM expanded the program to more than 40 pharmacy and medical students from each institution in the 2012-13 academic year. The program partners are optimistic about eventually offering the experience to all third-year BCM medical and UH pharmacy students, as well as incorporating pharmacy faculty. \"It hasn't been a homerun, it's been a grand slam, \" said Anne Gill, Dr.P .H., M.S., associate professor of Pediatrics and Medical Ethics and director of Longitudinal Programs at BCM. \"It's been a very rich, organic interchange among the clinicians and the medical and pharmacy students. The goal is to improve communication between patients and medical students as well as other health professions, and for the medical students to gain appreciation for the knowledge, skills and contributions brought by other members of the team. \" BCM/Harris Health System physician and medical student preceptor Anita Major , M.D., said geriatrics is an ideal setting to begin exposing students to the value and respective contributions of interprofessional team-based care. \"I think it is essential to point out in the early stages of clinical education that an entire team helps to treat and keep the patient safe, \" Major said. \"There are so many issues - economic, psychological, medical, functional, spiritual, social - we need the expertise of several people to take good care of our patients. As it's the reality of how we practice, why not encourage interprofessional interactions early among students?\" By interacting with patients in their home environment, the interprofessional team is able to observe aspects of patients' normal routine and make adjustments to the care plan or even BCM medical students Laura Knott and Paul Fischbuch inventory a patient's polypharmacy with Pharm.D. students Danielle Stifter and Jamie Folk. University of Houston College of Pharmacy 19 Medical students Jason Zhang and Michael Abers and pharmacy students Vivian Nguyen and Quang Nguyen prepare recommendations for a geriatric patient during a January 2013 LACE home visit. suggest changes in behavioral practices that might not otherwise be apparent. \"The bulk of my exposure to my patients had either been at settings such as the pharmacy store itself or during health fair events with organizations, \" said Pharm.D. student Kim Anh Pham . \"Having an opportunity to meet our patient in their home environment gives us a better idea of how they are living. We were able to take note on the type of food our patient is eating, identify any potential hazards in the home, and speak with the caretakers. \" Pharm.D. student Susan Hammoude agreed that seeing the entire \"picture\" of the patient first hand was invaluable to making appropriate evaluation of the current care plan. \"It brought all aspects of the patient - the life, home and family - within the spectrum of our care, \" she said. \"It was not just 'take a history and move along'; it was more like 'assess patient, interview family members, look at how the bottles of medicine are organized, take a look around for OTC/herbal products used, assess living conditions, assess the level of cooperation of the family/caretakers, determine potential living hazards, peek into the refrigerator to confirm adequate nutrition, and further inquiry of a variety of aspects of the patient's life. ' \"This style of healthcare administration is especially important in geriatrics who not only suffer from physiological diseases, but also neurological comorbidities which often leave them incapable of self-care despite medical attention. \" One of the challenges to improvements in patient outcomes that the students recognized was poor medication adherence. \"This project gave us the opportunity to look behind the curtain to see the real aspects of patient life outside to a clinical setting, \" said pharmacy students Danielle Stifter . \"We had a case where a patient had so many medications that they were just mixed together in one container. The medications were only recognized by their physical characteristics, and the patient's adherence was poor. We were able to intervene by educating the patient on medication adherence and counseled on the medications. \" Major agreed that identifying the underlying factors contributing to poor medication adherence can be difficult for students and practitioners without investigation. \"It opens their eyes to so many aspects of care and threats to patient safety, specifically related to medications, \" Major said. \"How else would they see the expired medication bottles? Or, notice the absence of food in the fridge, so therefore the obvious inability to pay for medications and adhere to treatment plans? Or, see the six bottles of the same medication because the auto-refill process works, but only if the patient actually takes the medication rather than saves it?\" Pharm.D. student Jamie Folk said the visits reinforced the necessity for healthcare professionals to ensure patients comprehend instructions and to pay attention to the details. \"I had no idea that people in the community didn't know the correct way to use a pillbox, \" Folk said. \"Instead of using the Sunday through Saturday box by placing the entire day's medications in one slot, one patient had placed the blood pressure medication in Sunday's slot, the diabetes medication in Monday, etc. \"To help our patient, we stayed longer and helped separate all the drugs into their (original) containers because our patient decided not to use the pillbox the way it was meant to be used. This was the biggest shock that I came away with, and it really opened my eyes to the importance of patient counseling. \" The visits went beyond a strictly \"academic exercise, \" with pharmacy and medical students making legitimate, valid contributions to patient care. \"The attending was very attentive to the recommendations we offered and quizzed us about the indications for a variety of drugs the patient was prescribed, \" Hammoude said. \"By the end of the visit, we recommended to reduce a carvedilol dose and advised the caretakers about the proper administration of bisphosphonates. \" Major agreed that the contributions and problem-solving capabilities of pharmacy practitioners - and students - cannot be underestimated or disregarded. continued next page UHCOP Pharm.D. student Kim Anh Pham and BCM geriatrics physician Anita Major review a patient's medications during an in-home visit. 20 University of Houston College of Pharmacy Award-winning pharmacy visionary David Zilz held group discussions and individual project-development sessions with members of the Pharmacy Administration M.S./PGY1-PGY2 residency program. UH College of Pharmacy was among fewer than two dozen sites across the nation selected for the 2012 American Society of Health-system Pharmacists' Visiting Leaders Program. The program brought David Zilz , R.Ph., M.S., FASHP , to Houston for two days of lectures as well as group and one-on-one meetings with residents, residency directors, faculty members and students. A clinical professor emeritus of the University of Wisconsin School of Pharmacy and recipient of the ASHP Harvey K. Lecture Award, Zilz is recognized as a pharmacy visionary and futurist. Zilz shared his analyses of trends shaping the future of the pharmacy profession and the public health challenges, such as the projected jump in the rates of obesity and diabetes, that present defining opportunities for practitioners. Zilz also urged the residents to take advantage of their peers' pre- pharmacy education or careers to expand their \"mental tool- kit\" and develop innovative solutions to issues. Futurist Zilz Urges Residents to Integrate Knowledge from Other FieldsIPE continued from page 19 \"I have the outpatient pharmacy saved in my cell phone because I so often call for advise or suggestions, \" Major said. \"When a patient can't swallow pills, the pill can't be crushed, and there isn't a liquid form, what can I recommend? I have had some pharmacies agree to compound a liquid from medicated powder. Things I never would have considered possible, the pharmacist is able to do. \"In one case, I wasn't sure oral furosemide would work anymore, and the student suggested IM furosemide since we did not want to admit to the hospital. Thus, the students have interacted with patients, educated them, and changed the treatment plan. \" The benefits of the interprofessional team approach were immediately realized by the participants, as the strengths of each profession were utilized to provide unique perspectives for developing or modifying the care plan. \"I didn't realize how much they know after such a short time in medical school, and I felt they were also surprised at how much pharmacy students know and how we are able to help patients with their numerous medications, \" Folk said. \"It teaches us that we need collaboration in health care, with physicians and pharmacists working together. \"The medical students are able to diagnose the patient and do a thorough physical exam, and pharmacy students are able to give a recommendation/treatment option to the diagnosis. The patient gets the best of both worlds, instead of both groups skimming diagnosis and treatment. \" The medical students also acknowledged gaining a better appreciation of the impact of teamwork from the experience. \"I was impressed by the ability of the pharmacy students BCM-UHCOP interprofessional team members help a geriatric patient better organize her medications to help her maintain adherence. to apply their knowledge of drugs to real cases, \" said BCM medical student Michael Abers . \"I am very confident in the ability of pharmacists to contribute to patient care. \" With exposure to a clinical pharmacist-Pharm.D. student duo who \"played a major role in our team's decision and treatment options\" during an earlier rotation, medical student James Berg said the home visits reinforced his esteem for pharmacy. \"They helped decipher particular generic and brand drugs, including their names and mechanism of action, \" Berg said. The UH students reported feeling like they bonded with their medical student counterparts. \"There was mutual respect between the medical students, pharmacy students, and physicians, \" Stifter said. \"We recognized that we shared the common goal of helping patients and were able to establish a rapport. In fact, the relationship between the disciplines was much more dynamic, more fluid than what I expected. \" University of Houston College of Pharmacy 21 Student's Pharmacy Skills in High Demand on Peruvian Mountain Although she admits that the student's age-old lament of \"when am I going to use this?\" briefly crossed her mind while studying about the seemingly obscure bacterial infection Helicobacter pylori for an exam last fall, Pharm.D. student Lynsey Smith was nonetheless grateful for the knowledge only a week later during a medical mission trip to Peru. \"It's a painful gastrointestinal infection that's common in developing countries like Peru because of unsanitary food and drinking water, \" Smith said. \"It was just one of the reminders of how fortunate we are here in terms of living conditions, nutrition and basic medical resources. Most of us don't give it much thought, but something as simple as a 30-day supply of ibuprofen means so much to them. \" Smith's recent mission trip was her third visit to the mountain village of Collique, Peru, through a collaboration of South Main Baptist Church and Operaci\u00f3n San Andr\u00e9s (OSA). During the weeklong mission up to three times per year, about 50 team members from pharmacy, medicine, nursing, dentistry, optometry and social work care for up to 2,000 patients. Although not a fluent Spanish speaker, Smith said she used key Spanish phrases to counsel the patients about proper medication usage and adherence. \"Patients held on to every word and were thankful for our counseling, \" she said. \"We also created educational pamphlets in Spanish for diabetes, hyperlipidemia and safe use of pain medications. \" In addition to pain relievers, other high- demand therapeutics in the formulary were and vitamin-and-mineral anti- inflammatory ointment. \"There is a great physician-pharmacist relationship in the field; many of the doctors would regularly consult with us on the best medication for patients, \" she said. \"The experience gave me a lot of practical knowledge, especially the importance of teamwork and communicating efficiently in such a chaotic environment with so many patients, and using your best clinical judgment to make substitutions if supplies were running low. \" Smith isn't the only Cougar who's undertaken medical missions to Peru: Alumna Patti Peymann , Pharm.D. ('97), interim system director of Clinical Pharmacy at Memorial Hermann Healthcare System, has been an OSA volunteer since 2004. Her work over several mission trips was recognized with Memorial Hermann's Award for Exceptional Missionary Work in 2009. Lynsey Smith reviews counsels an elderly Peruvian patient on her medications. High School Summer Camp Seeks to Promote Pharmacy, STEM Careers UH College of Pharmacy is hosting a Pharmacy Summer Camp June 26-28 to encourage junior and senior high school students to pursue professional pharmacy or other careers in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields. The camp is part of an effort to expose students, especially among students from traditionally underrepresented African-American and Hispanic backgrounds, to career tracks in the research sciences and health care. According to the National Institutes of Health, African- Americans and Hispanics represent about 28 percent of the U.S. population yet account for only 7 percent of America's STEM workforce.Camp activities will include advice and planning for pursuing an education and career in pharmacy and other STEM- related fields; career discovery to learn about the diverse job opportunities in science, research and health care; and tips and guidance for developing effective study skills to manage the academic and experiential requirements of a pharmacy educational program. In addition, campers will participate in laboratory tours and discussions with UHCOP basic science and clinical research faculty; a tour of the Texas Medical Center; and presentations by real-world pharmacists from various practice settings. The camp is being supported by diversity education grant from Walgreens.

Established in 2002 by the Asian American Health Coalition in the area historically known as \"New Chinatown, \" HOPE Clinic's mission is to \"improve the health of residents in greater Houston through culturally and linguistically appropriate services. \" The Federally Qualified Health Center serves about 13,000 patients per year of predominately Asian and Hispanic heritage. Much of the credit for the collaboration between HOPE and the college goes to Santhi Masilamani , Pharm.D., MBA, CDE, UHCOP clinical assistant professor and director of Ambulatory Based Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences, who teamed with HOPE staff in the first HRSA-led Patient Safety and Clinical Pharmacy Services Collaborative (PSPC) when she worked at Harris Health System. Community health clinics such as HOPE offer students a challenging setting to gain broad experience in pharmacy clinical services, including patient recruitment, disease state/ medication therapy management, medication adherence, and interprofessional collaboration. Project leaders also develop a range of management, organizational and interpersonal skills by recruiting, training and coordinating fellow student volunteers. \"The diversity of our student body has been a great fit with the patient population served by the clinic, \" Masilamani said. \"Our projects not only address specific health priorities of these patients, but they also give students first-hand experience in every step of developing and implementing culturally and linguistically proficient clinical pharmacy services in an primary care setting. \" In addition to Masilamani, alumni/preceptors ('97), UHCOP clinical associate professor, are supervising students on projects with direct patient interaction. Chronic Hepatitis B Approximately one-half of the 1 million people in the U.S. with Clinic Collaboration Cultivates Connection to Community Care Pharm.D. student Van Hoang and alumna Setchia Traore have been recruiting patients diagnosed with or at risk of developing hyperlipidemia participate in a lipid management program at HOPE Clinic. chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are Asian/Pacific Islanders, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health. With many infected individuals unaware of their status or not actively managing their disease, third-year student Trang Tran began working with Masilamani and the HOPE team in 2011 to develop a community awareness and patient education/monitoring program. Tran collaborated with medical students from UTHealth and Baylor College of Medicine last year to host a \"Healthy Living and Hepatitis B\" workshop targeting the Chinese and Vietnamese communities. The interprofessional collaboration extended further to providing awareness education at health fairs in the Asian-American community. Tran also coordinated several lectures sponsored by Gilead Sciences and Bristol Myers-Squibb to educate pharmacy and medical students on the epidemiology and management of chronic hepatitis B. With such diversity within the college's student body, Tran was able to recruit fellow students with the language capacity to conduct monthly telephone-based counseling sessions in English, Vietnamese, Cantonese and Mandarin Chinese, and Korean. The calls focus on educating patients about their disease state, medication adherence, potential side effects of therapeutic agents, and other preventive measures to protect their family. By March 2013, 20 patients were in the enrolled in the program. \"We're emphasizing preventive measures, such as appropriate hygiene practices, to minimize the risk of transmission to friends and family, \" Tran said. \"We're also encouraging patients to talk with their family and friends about getting screened and vaccinated. \" Dyslipidemia Although one of the most preventable diseases through healthier lifestyle choices and controlling major risk factors such as obesity, lack of exercise and smoking, cardiovascular disease remains the top killer of men and women in the U.S. Third-year student Van Hoang developed and launched a Student Trang Tran, front row second from right, organized a community workshop on Hepatitis B in English, Vietnamese and Chinese with HOPE Clinic Chief Medical Officer Richard Andrews and fellow students.Jerry Powers/UH photo University of Houston College of Pharmacy 23 HOPE's Andrews and Pharm.D. student Daniel Nguyen run simulations of their ADE/ADR reporting system in the clinic's patient electronic medical records.hyperlipidemia disease-state management clinic in which students monitor patient compliance over the course of a year. Hoang developed a protocol with Masilamani which allows students to conduct in-clinic physical assessments, medication management and counseling of patients every three months under preceptor supervision. Students also perform follow-up sessions by telephone between the clinic visits. \"The project taught me how to start up a clinic, establish communication between providers beyond patient care, and an in-depth knowledge of lipids, guidelines and workflows, as well as some of the limitations of our program, such as the number of patients we can realistically see in one day, \" Hoang said. \"The experience solidified my intent to do a residency and pursue ambulatory care as a career. \" With her upcoming transition into fourth year experientials, Hoang is passing on project coordination to current second-year student Christina (Thuy) Vo . Adverse Drug Events According to a 1998 Institute of Medicine report, preventable medication errors result in approximately 98,000 deaths - more than diabetes, influenza and pneumonia - and more than 1 million injuries per year. While enhanced patient safety is the primary goal for greater pharmacovigilence, numerous studies also have demonstrated benefits ranging from significantly improved outcomes and lower total healthcare costs, including reduced hospital admissions, as a result of these efforts. Second-year student Daniel Nguyen and Masilamani developed an ADE/ADR reporting system at HOPE using the clinic's existing electronic medical record (EMR) program. By piggybacking onto the universal ICD-9 coding system by which patient diagnoses are classified in their EMR, Nguyen and HOPE's Chief Medical Officer Richard Andrews , M.D., created a cost-efficient, user-friendly system for logging ADEs/ ADRs. Nguyen said the pharmacy informatics project offered a unique opportunity to interact with health professionals and administrative personnel while devising and testing the program and training users. \"I only had a general idea of what ADEs and ADRs were when I started the project, but I've gained a greater appreciation of the value and impact of reporting and tracking them, \" Nguyen said. \"It's actually been fun to learn about and come up with ideas for how the clinic staff, other students or professors can use the data for studying trends and other types of research. \" Diabetes Masilamani and HOPE physician Charu Sawheny , M.D., are working with students to deliver diabetes education to patients and families at the clinic. The group is tackling what is considered one of the greatest threats to American health: diabetes. With the support of a $20,000 grant from Novo Nordisk to HOPE Clinic, Masilamani has implemented a diabetes self-management education (DSME) program recruiting 400 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus or borderline \"at-risk\" of developing the disease to receive self-management training. Diabetes group classes are presented in English and Spanish to teach patients disease monitoring with glucometers and management through a combination of diet, exercise and medication. UHCOP students Payal Patel is helping to coordinate the program, with Spanish translation by student Haruna Kato and Vietnamese translation by students Tram Tran and Jennie Do . \"Diabetes is among the top 10 patient diagnoses at HOPE, and one in which pharmacists have had great interventional success, \" said Masilamani, who is a certified diabetes educator. \"Patients often don't understand that monitoring and managing their disease is a lifelong commitment; we see many patients who don't fully appreciate the seriousness of this disease and the life- changing, life-threatening consequences of poor compliance with their management plan. \" HOPE Clinic's CEO Andrea Caracostis , M.D., said partnerships with academic programs will be critical to maintain efficient use of resources with the expected increase in demand on clinics following implementation of the Affordable Care Act in 2014. \"Part of our job as providers is to educate and train the next generation of providers, \" Caracostis said. \"It's important for students to be exposed to nonprofit work so they might consider working in this setting after graduation. \" UHCOP Clinical Assistant Professor Santhi Masilamani and HOPE Clinic CEO Andrea Caracostis see vast opportunities for collaboration between the college and the community health clinic in the heart of Houston's New Chinatown. 24 University of Houston College of PharmacyInternships Provide Last Piece of Puzzle for Graduate Students Seeking Edge into Industry Job Although the pace of hiring has slowed over the last five years as the pharmaceutical industry has undergone massive restructuring and consolidation of operations, jobs are still available for highly skilled and experienced graduates. Many graduate students are finding (or rediscovering) the key to standing out from the crowd is through internships, which remain highly competitive in their own right. Graduate student internships are much more valuable than a resume bulletpoint to catch the eye of recruiters; the level of responsibilities and expectations are multiplied exponentially in graduate-level internships along with the rewards of expanded networking opportunities, additional mentorship, exposure to corporate practices, and further polishing of technical and non-technical skills, including presentations. \"One of the good points for students with the job cuts has been the greater availability of internships, \" observed pharmaceutics graduate student Tanay Samant , who completed an internship with Pfizer in Groton, Conn., last summer and has been accepted into a second internship - this time with BioMarin - for summer 2013. Although the interns noted that the basic lab techniques and equipment were mostly familiar territory, the underlying philosophy in academia and industry is significantly different. \" Academia is very curiosity driven, where you want to know 'why' about a specific problem, \" said Pharmaceutics doctoral student Tao Niu , who worked with Boerhinger Ingelheim in Danbury, Conn., last summer. \"In industry, the ultimate goal is to bring a product to market; if a drug candidate doesn't work, they move on to another candidate instead of investing time and resources into finding out 'why' it doesn't work. \" The UH interns said they were comfortable in the transition from academia to industry, largely thanks to the quality of their training and education at the college. \" Although the instruments, workload and data reporting were different from UH, I did not feel that as a challenge but instead made myself familiar with the company policies and scientific regulations very fast, \" said Adarsh Gandhi , who completed an internship at Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc. in Raritan, N.J., in summer 2012 before graduating in August as a final \"stepping stone\" on his career path. Much like their work on campus, graduate-level interns are expected to make legitimate contributions with a high level of accountability and independence. \"The interns are involved in lab/group meetings, presentations, and discussions with senior officials in designing and conducting studies, \" Gandhi said. \"I was lucky to have a supervising manager who was helpful at every stage. I had the complete freedom to express my views regarding my interest in a particular study. \" Samant said he was grateful for not only the technical support he received from supervisors and other team members, but also their guidance in navigating the working world. \"It was a fantastic experience to be working with some of the top researchers in the world, \" Samant said. \"Everyone was always approachable to sharing their advice and the steps they took in graduate school to help them establish their careers. They also gave me ideas to improve my doctoral project. \" Niu said he enjoyed the opportunity to gain experience in projects unrelated to his doctoral project, as well as interacting with fellow interns from around the country within and outside of the pharmaceutics field. \"One of my roommates was an MBA student, so I was able to learn a little about the business side of the industry and make another connection because networking is so important no matter what area you're working in, \" Niu said. Pharmaceutics doctoral students aren't alone in recognizing the benefits of pursuing and securing summer internships. Pharmacy administration doctoral student and UHCOP alumnus Hemalkumar Mehta , M.S. ('10), completed an internship with Merck & Co. 's Epidemiology unit in North Wales, Pa., last summer. \" As a summer intern, I got an opportunity to work on two Pharmaceutics graduate student Tao Niu worked on drug formulation phase- behavior studies during his summer internship with Boerhinger Ingelheim.

It was a great experience and I would encourage all Ph.D. students to go for at least one internship. \" Fellow Pharmacy Administration doctoral student Parul Gupta , M.Pharm, worked on hemophilia and multiple sclerosis-related projects during her internship with Biogen- Idec's Global Market Access Department in Weston, Mass. \"These projects gave me a good learning experience in three different types of studies that are required in health economics and outcomes research, \" Gupta said. \"These projects provided an opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills I gained from my graduate training. Students should be encouraged to go for such internship programs as these are really enriching experience for personal and professional growth. \" The interns said they recognized the need to excel in the experience not only for their own benefit, but also as an obligation to their faculty advisors as well as their peers and successors to ensure the pipeline between the college and industry remains open. In addition to Samant, at least four other UHCOP graduate students have been accepted into summer 2013 internships: Pharmaceutics students Zhiyi Cui and Pranav Shah will be at Genentech and AstraZeneca, respectively; and Administration students Shalak Gunjal , Shivani Mhatre and Ayush Patel will be at Tufts Medical Center, Amgen and PharmMerit, respectively. After completing an internship with Pfizer last year, Pharmaceutics doctoral student Tanay Samant is looking forward to undertaking his second internship in summer 2013. Gupta Pham, Suerte Among Recipients of 'Make Your Mark' Recognition at APhA-ASP Midyear Meeting Pharm.D. students Kim Anh Pham and Sarah Suerte were among the \"Make Your Mark\" honorees at the American Pharmacists Association-Academy of Student Pharmacists' Region 6 Midyear Regional Meeting Nov. 6-11 in Wichita, Kansas. The program honors student pharmacists who have demonstrated continued involvement, dedication, and leadership at their local chapter. As chair of her ASP chapter's \"Operation Heart\" initiative, Pham was recognized for her leadership in organizing collaborative projects with the American Heart Association-Southwest Affiliate, including a community health fair in ASP members performed more than 300 blood pressure screenings. Suerte was honored for her service as MRM Meeting Liaison as well as coordinating Mock Interview sessions for the chapter's pre- pharmacy members. Clay Elected to Vice Satrap for Newly Reorganized Southwest Region of Kappa Psi Fraternity Pharm.D. student Bobby Clay was elected Regional Vice Satrap (Vice President) at the Kappa Psi Pharmaceutical Fraternity's Inaugural Assembly of the Southwest Province Oct. 19-21, 2012, in Dallas. The new regional province comprises nine collegiate chapters, including UH's Delta Delta chapter, and four graduate chapters from Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico. The Kappa Psi provinces were realigned due to growth in the number of chapters across the country (the UH chapter's former province encompassed 27 chapters spanning eight states). Among other duties, Clay and his fellow executive board members, including alumna SueAnn Wang, Pharm.D. ('12), were tasking with developing the province's new bylaws.

In 2010, she was promoted to Division Director of Clinical Pharmacy Services for multiple Texas divisions of HCA, which allowed her to focus more on infectious diseases initiatives. She worked to develop and implement clinical pharmacy services for all 17 HCA hospitals in the division and was instrumental in developing the Antimicrobial Management Program for the entire HCA system. In addition to training the next generation of pharmacists as a preceptor, Patel published numerous abstracts and publications in the areas of outcomes research in PK/PD, antibiotic dosing, outpatient lipid management, tight glycemic control, anticoagulation, and sepsis. In 2010, she was selected as a faculty member for a national IDSA/SHEA workshop on antibiotic stewardship and was recognized as a Board Certified Pharmacotherapy Specialist. In March 2012, Patel completed the Antimicrobial Stewardship Certificate Program of the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists, which has established a new award in memory of Patel. Among her numerous awards were the North Texas Division HCA Innovator Award for Quality/Patient Safety Improvement; The Medical Center of Plano HCA Innovator Award for Financial Impact; and the ASHP Best Practice Award Winner for project entitled \"The Successful Implementation of a Collaborative Sepsis Bundle at a Community Hospital. \" Patel is survived by fellow UHCOP alumnus Rakesh Patel, R.Ph. (B.S. '95), whom she married in 1999, and her two children, Sohan and Asha. She also loved animals and shared her home with three German Shepherds: Jake, Otto and Scout. She found great joy in helping local animal shelters with fund-raisers and always was available for animals in need.
