Biological Agents 1. Small spills that can be handled with disposable pads, paper toweling and disinfectants on hand can be contained by laboratory personnel under the direction of the Principal Investigator. 2. Large spills ( greater than five liters) of biohazardous agents should not be handled by laboratory personnel. Personnel should hold their breath and exit the lab immediately. Notify the Biosafety Officer immediately! Personal decontamination and follow -up medical treatment should be performed as soon as practical. 3. Do not re -enter the lab under any circumstances, until given clearance to do so by the Biosafety Officer. Decontamination personnel should not enter the area until a minimum of 30 minutes time has elapsed after the spill. 4. Contaminated clothing is to be removed and autoclaved with no excep tions. If showers are available, wash all exposed areas of the body with a germicidal surgeon's scrub or soap and water. Contaminated items may be decontaminated or discarded at the discretion of the Biosafety Officer. 5. Place a dry towel or pad over the sp illed material, and absorb as much spilled material as possible. These towels or pads can be autoclaved and disposed of in red bags. Place a towel or pad soaked in disinfectant directly over the spill area, and allow sufficient contact time for the disinfe ctant to neutralize any organisms present. Place dry pads or toweling over the wet ones and carefully remove and contain for disposal. 6. Spills in a biological cabinet pose little aerosol hazard to lab personnel. A wipe down with 3% Wescodyne , 1/100 dilutio n of Household Chlorine Bleach, or 70% ethanol or 70% isopropanol can be used to disinfect the cabinet. 7. Do not open internal surfaces of the biological safety cabinet without prior decontamination of the cabinet. Exposure to viable infectious organisms w ithin these areas could result. This procedure should be performed only by certified individuals knowledgeable in NSF and NIH decontamination procedures. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 6 | P a g e 8. SPILLS, PATHOGENIC AGENT EXPOSURES AND NEEDLESTICKS All spills resulting in personal exposure, exposu res to BBFE (BloodBorne Fluid Exposure) and needle sticks occurring in ISM -MS Research Labs must be reported to the Biosafety Officer immediately. * In the event of a BBFE, the exposed individual is directed to follow the procedures given below: Emplo yees and volunteers; contact EHS x -951-7223 or GO TO 19 East 98th Street, 2nd floor. Medical Students; contact Jack Martin Fund Clinic (212 -824-7395, ext 57395) Contractors and all others staff ; go to Emergency Department for follow -up car e When EHS is closed , go to the Emergency Department and call the Nursing Administrator - [Dial \"O\"]. 9. An emergency action procedure should be drafted by the Principal Investigator and made available in written form, to all laboratory personnel and support staff associated with a hazardous project. Treatments, post -exposure vaccination, hospitalization or other interventions should be addressed in this procedure. 10. In laboratories handling large -scale RG -2 and higher agents, the risks associated with an exp osure, the procedures and equipment used to protect personnel from the associated hazards and risks of working in that laboratory must be written out in a Standard Operating Procedure . All lab personnel and support staff must have access to the written pro cedures at all times, and should receive annual training in those procedures. Bloodborne Agents have specific requirements as stipulated in OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.1030 Bloodborne Pathogens Standard: https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/bloodbornepathogens/index.html B. amounts of aqueous solutions of dilute carcinogens can be contained by personnel under the direction of the Principal Investigator. 2. Exposure to concentrated stocks of carcinogens is to be avoided at all costs. In the event of a spill of any volatile, concentrated material, do not attempt to contain the Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 7 | P a g e spill, but leave the area immediately and contact the Mount Sinai Security Office at \"60\" Security will notify the Chemical Hygiene Officer or Env Health and Safety individual covering after -hours and weekends . Give as much information as you can about the incident. a. DIAL '60' and give YOUR: b. NAME c. LOCATION OF SPILL AND YOUR CURRENT LOCATION d. CONTACT NUMBER (from where you called if different from the lab) e. APPROXIMATE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL INVOLVED f. (1ml, 500mls, 1liter, several (dry)ounces, \u00bc pound container etc.) g. NAME(S) OF ANY / ALL EXPOSED INDIVIDUALS h. NAME(S) OF ANY / INJURED INDI VIDUALS i. Follow -up with EnvHS as soon as possible j. 3. Do not re -enter the area under any circumstances until given authorization to do so by the Chemical Hygiene Officer. 4. All contaminated clothing is to be removed at once, and preferably discarded. 5. Report to Employee Health Service or to the Emergency Department on weekends or off -hours for medical attention if indicated. It is advisable to have a copy of the carcinogen's Safety Data Sheet in order to assist medical staff. 6. Written Emergency reaction procedures should be drafted and available to all personnel working in the laboratory, especially for the chemicals required in OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.1450 Laboratory Standard : https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/laboratories/standards.html The specific 29 CFR 1910 S tandards for select chemical hazards can be found at: https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owasrch.search_form?p_doc_type=STANDARD S&p_toc_level=1&p_keyvalue=1910 under each sub -section reference, i.e.\".1450\" . 7. Safety Data Sheets must be available to all laboratory personnel at all times that are working with or have exposure to carcinogens and other toxic compounds. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 8 | P a g e C. Personal Exposures Depending on the nature of the injury and the material being utilized at the time, different approaches to providing first -aid will be exercised in response to the gravity of the incident. Obviously, contaminated wounds with blood or materials known to con tain pathogenic agents carry a higher risk of infection than \"clean\" wounds. One must consider whether the site was clean at the time of injury, i.e. a cut with a clean scalpel through a bloody glove is as dangerous as a cut with a contaminated object. If there is any doubt as to whether the site or the instrument causing the injury was contaminated, treat the incident as if it was an exposure to a pathogenic agent. 1. When working with known human pathogenic agents or with HUMAN source material, i.e. bl ood, body fluids and tissues, wash the wound with copious amounts of soap and water immediately, generating a good lather through gentle friction of the hands. This also applies to carcinogens and promoters. 2. Do not use strong disinfectants, scrub brush es or any other object that can abrade the skin. These activities could cause additional damage and increase the chances of penetration of either a pathogen or toxic or carcinogenic chemical. 3. If the wound is a puncture or laceration produced by a con taminated sharp, allow the wound to bleed under a steady gently flowing stream of water. Do not squeeze the wound, since this may cause additional trauma to the site and force pathogens and carcinogens deeper into the tissues. Wash the wound site with soap and water. 4. If any of the materials described in paragraph 2 (above) enter the eye, or splash into the mouth, rinse with water only, immediately. For an eye exposure, care must be taken to rinse the affected eye in a manner that will not introduce the contaminated rinsate into the unaffected eye. Rinse for a full ten minutes at a minimum with a gentle stream of water, or use an eye cup if one is available. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 9 | P a g e 5. Once the injury or site of exposure has been cleansed, report to the Employee Health Servic e or Emergency Department immediately. If you are a student, go to the appropriate service for follow -up evaluation and treatment. 6. Report the incident to the Biosafety Officer immediately after treatment using an Incident Report form. D. Emergency Information Cards It is a useful practice to develop and distribute among all laboratory personnel and support staff Emergency Information Cards that can be carried in a lab coat pocket or in a person's wallet or handbag. This card should contain the nam e and synonyms of a particular chemical, the Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number, the Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances (RTECS) number, and a short synopsis of signs and symptoms of exposure and toxification with the subject chemical. International Safety Cards developed by NIOSH can be obtained here for some chemicals , https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ipcs/ and also at this site: https://www.cdc.gov/n iosh/npg/ In similar fashion, cards can be made for biological agents and toxins, using information found in The CDC publication, BMBL (ref.6) , available at http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/index.html or the Health Canada MSDS list, available at http://www.hc -sc.gc.ca/pphb -dgspsp/msds - ftss/index.html (This site is OHS, http://www.hc - sc.gc.ca/pphb -dgspsp/ols -bsl/index.html ). These cards are invaluable in an emergency situation, providing much needed information to health care professional or emergency department personnel providing treatment. The Biosafety Officer can assist you in preparing these cards.

Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 12 | P a g e Chapter 2: Biological Safety Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 13 | P a g e A. General Biological Procedures In Stedman's Medical Dictionary , 27th Edition, on e can find the following definition: \"bi-o-safe-ty: Safety measures applied to the handling of biological materials or organisms with a known potential to cause disease in humans ...\" While the definition is relatively simple and straightforward, the principles and practices employed in biosafety range in complexity and detail in direct relation to the relative risks associated with a given microorganism or its products. Our working definition for a biological hazard or biohazard is any bacterium, prion, rickettsia, virus, fungus, parasite or its products (i.e. toxins) that can self -replicate, invad e a host and cause an infection, or can cause morbidity or mortality in humans or animals. While the definition appears to be broad, it is limited primarily to those agents that can infect humans or are suspected of infecting humans primarily. Hazard is a specific property or set of properties that are a hallmark for a given pathogen, such as spore formation in Histoplasma capsulatum, or toxin production in Clostridium botulinum . In a simple sense, it is what makes the organism dangerous and noteworthy, and allows it to establish an infection or produce a series of symptoms and sequelae in a host. Risk is simply determining what your odds are of coming down with that series of symptoms and sequelae once you and your organism of choice have come in contact with one another. There is an intricate interplay of infectious dose, host susceptibility, virulence of the pathogen, route of exposure, and the individual's immune status that begins once an exposure has occurred. It is to be noted that not all exposures result in an infection. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 14 | P a g e Risk Groups are the four categories that the CDC and the NIH use in order to classify microorganisms with respect to the most probable outcomes of infect ion after exposure to a given organism has occurred. Biological Safety Levels are the recommended set of microbiological practices, facilities, equipment and procedures that are recognized as being effective in controlling exposures and the hazards of wor king with a given group of microorganisms. It is good practice to regard each level as a minimum level of practice, to be built upon until the next level is reached. These levels have long replaced the earlier \"P -1, P-2\" physical containment levels recom mended by the NIH Guidelines many years ago, making these terms archaic in current biosafety usage. While there is some correlation between the biosafety levels and the risk groups, the practice of saying \"Risk Group 2 uses Biosafety Level 2\" is no longer acceptable, and has been replaced with a \"sliding -scale\" concept of looking at the specific hazards and risks of a particular strain of an organism, and then custom building the biosafety level needed to provide maximum protection from those hazards. This can be accomplished by taking a given safety level and adding components from the next higher level to it to increase the level of protection using facilities and equipment at hand. This allows an investigator to customize the Biosafety Leve ls to address the specific hazards of a given strain of a microorganism. In order to simplify the process of evaluating the risks and the hazards associated with one's organism(s) of choice, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Nat ional Institutes of Health (NIH), both separately and jointly, have developed several guidelines and procedural guides to cover biosafety in the laboratory. Much of the content of this manual has been \"lifted\" directly from these publications, with some minor changes in order to provide a more concise reference for you. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 15 | P a g e In summation, there is ample evidence that working with microorganisms can be hazardous to your health, if you do not protect yourself and use good safety procedures. In the introduction to BMBL (ref. 6) , the statistic of 3, 921 cases of laboratory -acquired infections reported over 27 years is cited from Sulkin and Pike's studies (1976). Their observation was...\" fewer than 20% of all cases were associated with a known accident... \", and probably more than 80% of the cases were attributable to exposures to infectious aerosols. Pike is quoted as stating in 1979: ...\" the knowledge, the techniques, and the equipment to prevent most laboratory infections are available... \". If anything in this manual is not clear to you, please contact the Biosafety Officer, at 241 - 5169. If you are not sure of the hazards or risks involved in working with a given agent, contact the Biosafety Officer before initiating a project. The decision to work safely with biologic al agents rests squarely with you. No safety program, set of procedures, safety equipment or training will protect you if you disregard or decide not to practice biosafety in your laboratory. See Infection Control available under the \"Policies and Manual s\" icon on the MSMS Intranet Site at: http://intranet1.mountsinai.org/msmc/manuals_toc.asp B. Bloodborne Pathogens Used In Research Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 16 | P a g e There is a specific section outlining in detail what the established practices based on risk assessments pertain to work with these agents. The pathogens covered are not limited to Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Hepatitis B Virus, but all recognized Bloodborne agents and \"Other Potentially Infe ctious Materials\" derived from human sources (including commercial human sera etc.). The Standard Biosafety Level used is Biosafety Level 2 as found in the BMBL http://www.cdc.gov/od/ohs/biosfty/bmbl5/BMBL_5th_Edition.pdf , and contained Standard found at: :http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=100 51 addresses those laboratories working with the actual agents or large amo unts of a bloodborne agent specifically at section 1910.1030(e) HIV and HBV Research Laboratories and Product ion Facilities . C. Genetically -Modified Microorganisms (GMOs), Non -Recombinant DNA and Expression Products Recent advances in recombinant DNA technology are pushing the former definitions and risk - assessments into to grayer areas continually. Chimera organisms can be synthesized across Kingdoms and Phyla allowing the creation of animals with vegetable genes and visa-versa. It is also possible to create a new bacteria or virus with several properties that none of the parent organisms had. In like manner, it is possible to synthesize de novo , an artificial chromosome (BAC) that behaves like a regular bacterial chr omosome. All of these activities come under the control of the National Institutes of Health, specifically the Office of Science Policy (OSP) https://osp.od.nih.gov/about -us/ and supplemented technically, when needed by the Recombinant -DNA Advisory Committee (RAC). l Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 17 | P a g e A place to start looking for the appropriate Biosafety Levels and Risk Groups is in the NIH Guidelines, found at: https://osp.od.nih.gov/wp -content/uploads/2013/06/NIH_Guidelines.pdf under the Section II and Appendices \"B\" and \"G\", based on how much of the original backbone organism exists. In the case whe re the gene or entire chromosome has been synthesized de novo , the closest organism should be selected, and the BSL and RG levels worked -out along with recommendations from OBA and RAC, under \"Major Actions\" procedures. See Chapter 11 for information on t he NIH Guidelines, and recombinant DNA Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 18 | P a g e Chapter 3: Laboratory Biosafety Level Criteria Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 19 | P a g e Part 1 Standard Biosafety Level Criteria The essential elements of the four biosafety levels for activities involving infectious microorganisms and laboratory animals are summarized in Table 1 of this section and discussed in Section 2. The levels are designated in ascending order, by degree of p rotection provided to personnel, the environment, and the community. Standard microbiological practices are common to all laboratories. Special microbiological practices enhance worker safety, environmental protection, and address the risk of handling agen ts requiring increasing levels of containment. Biosafety Level 1 Biosafety Level 1 is suitable for work involving well -characterized agents not known to consistently cause disease in immunocompetent adult humans, and present minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment. BSL -1 laboratories are not necessarily separated from the general traffic patterns in the building. Work is typically conducted on open bench tops using standard microbiological practices. Special containment equi pment or facility design is not required, but may be used as determined by appropriate risk assessment. Laboratory personnel must have specific training in the procedures conducted in the laboratory and must be supervised by a scientist with training in microbiology or a related science. The following standard practices, safety equipment, and facility requirements apply to BSL -1: Laboratory Biosafety Level Criteria - Biosafety Level 1 A. Standard Microbiological Practices 1. The laboratory supervisor mus t enforce the institutional policies that control access to the laboratory. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 20 | P a g e 2. Persons must wash their hands after working with potentially hazardous materials and before leaving the laboratory. 3. Eating, drinking, smoking, handling contact lenses, appl ying cosmetics, and storing food for human consumption must not be permitted in laboratory areas. Food must be stored outside the laboratory area in cabinets or refrigerators designated and used for this purpose. 4. Mouth pipetting is prohibited; mechanic al pipetting devices must be used. ** Excerpted entirely from the BMBL , 5th Edition Laboratory Biosafety Level Criteria 5. Policies for the safe handling of sharps, such as needles, scalpels, pipettes, andbroken glassware must be developed and implemented. Whenever practical, laboratory supervisors should adopt improved engineering and work practice controls that reduce risk of sharps injuries. Precautions, including those listed below, must always be taken with sharp items. These include: a. Careful management of needles and other sharps are of primary Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 21 | P a g e importance. Needles must not be bent, sheared, broken, recapped, removed from disposable syringes, or otherwise manipulated by hand before disposal. b. Used disposable needles and syringes must be carefully placed in conveniently located puncture -resistant containers used for sharps disposal. c. Non disposable sharps must be placed in a hard walled container for transport to a processing area for decontamination, preferably by autocla ving. d. Broken glassware must not be handled directly. Instead, it must be removed using a brush and dustpan, tongs, or forceps. Plasticware should be substituted for glassware whenever possible. 6. Perform all procedures to minimize the creation of splashes and/or aerosols. 7. Decontaminate work surfaces after completion of work and after any spill or splash of potentially infectious material with appropriate disinfectant. 8. Decontaminate all cultures, stocks, and other potentially infectious materials Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 22 | P a g e before disposal using an effective method. Depending on where the decontamination will be performed, the following methods should be used prior to transport: a. Materials to be decontaminated outside of the immediate laboratory mus t be placed in a durable, leak proof container and secured for transport. b. Materials to be removed from the facility for decontamination must be packed in accordance with applicable local, state, and federal regulations. 9. A sign incorporating th e universal biohazard symbol must be posted at the entrance to the laboratory when infectious agents are present. The sign may include the name of the agent(s) in use, and the name and phone number of the laboratory supervisor or other responsible personne l. Agent information should be posted in accordance with the institutional policy. 10. An effective integrated pest management program is required. See Appendix G. 11. The laboratory supervisor must ensure that laboratory personnel receive Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 23 | P a g e apropriate training regarding their duties, the necessary precautions to prevent exposures, and exposure evaluation procedures. Personnel must receive annual updates or additional training when procedural or policy changes occur. Personal health status may impact a n individual's susceptibility to infection, ability to receive immunizations or prophylactic interventions. Therefore, all laboratory personnel and particularly women of child -bearing age should be provided with information regarding immune competence and conditions that may predispose them to infection. Individuals having these conditions should be encouraged to self -identify to the institution's healthcare provider for appropriate counseling and guidance. Laboratory Biosafety Level Criteria - Biosafety L evel 1 B. Special Practices None required. Laboratory Biosafety Level Criteria - Biosafety Level 1 C. Safety Equipment (Primary Barriers and Personal Protective Equipment) 1. Special containment devices or equipment, such as BSCs, are not generally required. 2. Protective laboratory coats, gowns, or uniforms are recommended to prevent contamination of personal clothing. 3. Wear protective eyewear when conducting procedures that have the potential to create splashes of microorganisms or other hazardous materials. Persons Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 24 | P a g e who wear contact lenses in laboratories should also wear eye protection. 4. Gloves must be worn to protect hands from exposure to hazardous materials. Glove selection should be based on an appropriate risk assessment. Alternatives to latex gloves should be available . Wash hands prior to leaving the laboratory. In addition, BSL -1 workers should: a. Change gloves when contaminated, integrity has been compromised, or when otherwise necessary. b. Remove gloves and wash hands when work with hazardous materials has been completed and before leaving the laboratory. c. Do not wash or reuse disposable gloves. Dispose of used gloves with other contaminated laboratory waste. Hand washing protocols must be rigorously followed. Laboratory Biosafety Level Criteria - Biosafety Level 1 D. Laboratory Facilities (Secondary Barriers) 1. Laboratories should have doors for access control. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 25 | P a g e 2. Laboratories must have a sink for hand washing. 3. The laborator y should be designed so that it can be easily cleaned. Carpets and rugs in laboratories are not appropriate. 4.

Bench tops must be impervious to water and resistant to heat, organic solvents, acids, alkalis, and other chemicals. b. Chairs used in laboratory work must be covered with a non -porous material that can be e asily cleaned and decontaminated with appropriate disinfectant. 5. Laboratories windows that open to the exterior should be fitted with screens. Biosafety Level 2 Biosafety Level 2 builds upon BSL -1. BSL -2 is suitable for work involving agents that pose moderate hazards to personnel and the environment. It differs from BSL -1 in that 1) laboratory personnel have specific training in handling pathogenic agents and are supervised by sci entists competent in handling infectious agents and associated procedures; 2) access to the laboratory is Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 26 | P a g e restricted when work is being conducted; and 3) all procedures in which infectious aerosols or splashes may be created are conducted in BSCs or other physical containment equipment. The following standard and special practices, safety equipment, and facility requirements apply to BSL -2: Laboratory Biosafety Le vel Criteria - Biosafety Level 2 A. Standard Microbiological Practices 1. The laboratory s upervisor must enforce the institutional policies that control access to the laboratory. 2. Persons must wash their hands after working with potentially hazardous materials and before leaving the laboratory. 3.

Agents with a close or identical antigenic relationship to agents requiring BSL -4 containment must be handled at this level until sufficient data are obtained either to confirm continued work at this level, or re-designate the level . . Laboratory staff must have specific and thorough training in handling extremely hazar dous infectious agents. Laboratory staff must understand the primary and secondary containment functions of standard and special practices, containment equipment, and laboratory design characteristics. All laboratory staff and supervisors must be compete nt in handling agents and procedures requiring BSL - 4 containment. Access to the laboratory is controlled by the laboratory supervisor in accordance with institutional policies. There are two models for BSL -4 laboratories: (1) A Cabinet Laboratory where al l handling of agents must be performed in a Class III BSC. (2) A Suit Laboratory where personnel must wear a positive pressure protective suit. BSL -4 Cabinet and Suit Laboratories have special engineering and design features to prevent microorganisms from being disseminated into the environment. Biosafety Level 4 is beyond the scope of current practice here at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Refer to the BMBL for further information on BSL -4. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 50 | P a g e Part 2 Vertebrate Animal Biosafety Level Criteria for Vivariu m Research Facilities This guidance is provided for the use of experimentally infected animals housed in indoor research facilities (e.g., vivaria), and is also useful in the maintenance of laboratory animals that may naturally harbor zoonotic infectious agents. In both instanc es, the institutional management must provide facilities, staff, and established practices that reasonably ensure appropriate levels of environmental quality, safety, security and care for laboratory animal. Laboratory animal facilities are a special type of laboratory. As a general principle, the biosafety level (facilities, practices, and operational requirements) recommended for working with infectious agents in vivo and in vitro are comparable. The animal room can present unique problems. In the animal room, the activities of the animals themselves can present unique hazards not found in standard microbiological laboratories. Animals may generate aerosols, they may bite and scratch, and they may be infected with a zoonotic agent. The co - application of Bi osafety Levels and the Animal Biosafety Levels are determined by a protocol driven risk assessment. These recommendations presuppose that laboratory animal facilities, operational practices, and quality of animal care meet applicable standards and regulati ons (e.g., Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals 1 and Laboratory Animal Welfare Regulations 2) and that appropriate species have been selected for animal experiments. In addition, the organization must have an occupational health and safety prog ram that addresses potential hazards associated with the conduct of laboratory animal research. The following publication by the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research (ILAR), Occupational Health and Safety in the Care of Research Animals 3 is most helpfu l in this regard. Additional safety guidance on working with non -human primates is available in the ILAR publication, Occupational Health and Safety in the Care and Use of Nonhuman Primates. 4 Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 51 | P a g e Facilities for laboratory animals used in studies of infectious or non -infectious disease should be physically separate from other activities such as animal production and quarantine, clinical laboratories, and especially from facilities providing patient care. Traffic flow that will minimize the risk of cross contami nation should be incorporated into the facility design. The recommendations detailed below describe four combinations of practices, safety equipment, and facilities for experiments with animals involved in infectious disease research and other studies that may require containment. These four combinations, desig nated Animal Biosafety Levels (ABSL) 1 -4, provide increasing levels of protection to personnel and to the environment, and are recommended as minimal standards for activities involving infected laboratory animals. The four ABSLs describe animal facilities and practices applicable to work with animals infected with agents assigned to Biosafety Levels 1 -4, respectively. Investigators that are inexperienced in conducting these types of experiments should seek help in designing their experiments from individu als who are experienced in this special work. In addition to the animal biosafety levels described in this section the USDA has developed facility parameters and work practices for handling agents of agriculture significance. Appendix D includes a discussi on on Animal Biosafety Level -3 Agriculture (ABSL -3-Ag). USDA requirements are unique to agriculture because of the necessity to protect the environment from pathogens of economic or environmental impact. Appendix D also describes some of the enhancements b eyond BSL/ABSL -3 that may be required by USDA -APHIS when working in the laboratory or vivarium with certain veterinary agents of concern. Facility standards and practices for invertebrate vectors and hosts are not specifically addressed in this section. Th e reader is referred to Appendix E for more information on the Arthropod Containment Guidelines. Animal Biosafety Level 1 Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 52 | P a g e Animal Biosafety Level 1 is suitable for work involving well characterized agents that are not known to cause disease in immunocompe tent adult humans, and present minimal potential hazard to personnel and the environment. ABSL -1 facilities should be separated from the general traffic patterns of the building and restricted as appropriate. Special containment equipment or facility desig n may be required as determined by appropriate risk assessment (See Section 2). Personnel must have specific training in animal facility procedures and must be supervised by an individual with adequate knowledge of potential hazards and experimental anima l procedures. The following standard practices, safety equipment, and facility requirements apply to ABSL -1: Vertebrate Animal Biosafety Level Criteria - Animal Biosafety Level 1 A. Standard Microbiological Practices 1. The animal facility director establishes and enforces policies, procedures, and protocols for institutional policies and emergency situations. Each institute must assure that worker safety and health concerns are addressed as part of the animal protocol review. Prior to beginning a study animal protocols must also be reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)5 and the Institutional Biosafety Committee. 2. A safety manual specific to the animal facility is prepared or adopted in Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 53 | P a g e consultation with the animal facility director and appropriate safety professionals. he saf ety manual must be available and accessible. Personnel are advised of potential hazards and are required to read and follow instructions on practices and procedures. 3. Supervisor must ensure that animal care, laboratory and support personnel receive appropriate training regarding their duties, animal husbandry procedure, potential hazards, manipulations of infectious agents, necessary precautions to prevent hazard or exposures, and hazard/exposure evaluation procedures (physical hazards, splashes, aerosolization, etc.). Personnel must receive annual updates or additional training when procedures or policies change. Records are maintained for all hazard evaluations, employee training sessions and staff attendance. 4. Appropriate medical surveil lance program is in place, as determined by risk assessment. The need for an animal allergy prevention program should be considered. Facility supervisors should ensure that medical staff is informed of potential occupational hazards within the animal fa cility, to include those associated with research, animal husbandry duties, animal care and manipulations. Personal health status may impact an individual's susceptibility to infection, ability to receive immunizations or prophylactic interventions. Theref ore, all personnel and particularly women of child -bearing age should be provided information regarding immune competence and conditions that may predispose them to infection. Individuals having these conditions should be encouraged to self -identify to the institution's healthcare provider for Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 54 | P a g e appropriate counseling and guidance.

Identification of specific infectious agents is recommended when more than one agent is being used within an animal room. Security -sensitive agent information should be posted in accordance with the institutional policy. Advance consideration should be given to emergency and disaster recovery plans, as a contingency for man -made or natural disasters.1,3,4 6. Access to the animal room is limited. Only those persons required for program or support purposes are authorized to enter the facility. All persons including facility personnel, service workers, and visitors are advised of the potential hazards (natural or research pathogens, allerg ens, etc) and are instructed on the appropriate safeguards. 7. Protective laboratory coats, gowns, or uniforms are recommended to prevent contamination of personal clothing. Gloves are worn to prevent skin contact with contaminated, infectious and hazar dous materials, and when handling animals. Gloves and personal protective Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 55 | P a g e equipment should be removed in a manner that minimizes transfer of infectious materials outside of the areas where infectious materials and/or animals are housed or are manipulated. Persons must wash their hands after removing gloves, and before leaving the areas where infectious materials and/or animals are housed or are manipulated. Eye and face and respiratory protection should be used in rooms containing infected animals, as di ctated by the risk assessment. 8. Eating, drinking, smoking, handling contact lenses, applying cosmetics, and storing food for human use should only be done in designated areas and are not permitted in animal or procedure rooms. 9. All procedures are carefully performed to minimize the creation of aerosols or splatters of infectious materials and waste. 10. Mouth pipetting is prohibited. Mechanical pipetting devices must be used. 11. Policies for the safe handling of sharps, such as needles, scalpe ls, pipettes, and broken glassware must be developed and implemented. When applicable, laboratory supervisors should adopt improved engineering and work practice controls that reduce the risk of sharps injuries. Precautions, including those listed belo w, must always be taken with sharp items. These include: a. Needles and syringes or other sharp instruments are limited to use in the animal facility when there is no alternative for such procedures as Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 56 | P a g e parenteral injection, blood collection, or aspirat ion of fluids from laboratory animals and diaphragm bottles. b. Disposable needles must not be bent, sheared, broken, recapped, removed from disposable syringes, or otherwise manipulated by hand before disposal. Used disposable needles must be careful ly placed in puncture -resistant containers used for sharps disposal. Sharps containers should be located as close to the work site as possible. c. Non -disposable sharps must be placed in a hard -walled container for transport to a processing area for d econtamination, preferably by autoclaving. d. Broken glassware must not be handled directly. Instead, it must be removed using a brush and dustpan, tongs, or forceps. Plasticware should be substituted for glassware whenever possible. e. Equipment containing sharp edges and corners should be avoided. 12. Equipment and work surfaces are routinely decontaminated with an appropriate disinfectant after work with an infectious agent, and after any spills, splashes, or other overt contami nation. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 57 | P a g e 13. Animals and plants not associated with the work being performed must not be permitted in the areas where infectious materials and/or animals are housed or are manipulated. 14. An effective integrated pest management program is required. See Appendix G. 15. All wastes from the animal room (including animal tissues, carcasses, and bedding) are transported from the animal room in leak -proof, covered containers for appropriate disposal in compliance with applicable institutional, local and s tate requirements. Decontaminate all potentially infectious materials before disposal using an effective method. Vertebrate Animal Biosafety Level Criteria - Animal Biosafety Level 1 B. Special Practices None required. Vertebrate Animal Biosafety Level Criteria - Animal Biosafety Level 1 C. Safety Equipment (Primary Barriers and Personal Protective Equipment) 1. A risk assessment should determine the appropriate type of personal protective equipment to be utilized. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 58 | P a g e 2. Special containment devices or equipment may not be required as determined by appropriate risk assessment. Protective laboratory coats, gowns, or uniforms may be required to prevent contamination of personal clothing. Protective outer clothing is not w orn outside areas where infectious materials and/or animals are housed or manipulated. Gowns and uniforms are not worn outside the facility. 3. Protective eyewear is worn when conducting procedures that have the potential to create splashes of microo rganisms or other hazardous materials. Persons who wear contact lenses should also wear eye protection when entering areas with potentially high concentrations or airborne particulates. Persons having contact with the NHP should assess risk of mucous membrane exposure and wear appropriate protective equipment (e.g., masks, goggles, faceshields, etc.) as needed. 4. Gloves are worn to protect hands from exposure to hazardous materials. A risk assessment should be performed to identify the appropriate glove for the task and alternatives to latex gloves should be available. Change gloves when contaminated, integrity has been compromised, or when otherwise necessary. Gloves must not be worn outside the animal rooms. Gloves and personal protective equi pment should be removed in a manner that prohibits transfer of infectious materials. Do not wash or reuse disposable gloves. Dispose of used gloves with other contaminated waste. Persons must wash their hands after handling animals and before leaving th e areas where infectious materials and/or animals are housed or are manipulated. Hand washing should occur after the removal of gloves. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 59 | P a g e Vertebrate Animal Biosafety Level Criteria - Animal Biosafety Level 1 D. Laboratory Facilities (Secondary Barriers) 1. The animal facility is separated from areas that are open to unrestricted personnel traffic within the building. External facility doors are self -closing and self -locking. Access to the animal facility is restricted. Doors to areas where infectious materials and/or animals are housed, open inward, are self -closing, are kept closed when experimental animals are present, and should never be propped open. Doors to cubicles inside an animal room may open outward or slide horizontally or vertically. 2. The animal facility must have a sink for hand washing. Sink traps are filled with water, and/or appropriate liquid to prevent the migration of vermin and gases. 3. The animal facility is designed, constructed, and maintained to facilitate cleaning and housekeeping. The interior surfaces (walls, floors and ceilings) are water resistant. It is recommended that penetrations in floors, walls and ceiling surfaces are sealed, to include openings around ducts, doors and door frames, to facilitate pest control and proper cleaning. Floors must be slip resistant, impervious to liquids, and resistant to chemicals. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 60 | P a g e 4. Cabinets and bench tops must be impervious to water and resistant to heat, organic solvents, acids, alkalis, and other chemicals.

A ducted exhaust air ventilation system is provided. Exhaust air is discharged to the outside without being recircula ted to other rooms. This system creates directional airflow which draws air into the animal room from \"clean\" areas and toward \"contaminated\" areas. Ventilation system design should consider the heat and high moisture load produced during the cleaning of animal rooms and the cage wash process. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 91 | P a g e Filtration and other treatments of the exhaust air may not be required, but should be considered based on site requirements, specific agent manipulations and use conditions. The exhaust must be dispersed away f rom occupied areasand air intakes, or the exhaust must be HEPA -filtered. Personnel must verify that the direction of the airflow (into the animal areas) is proper. It is recommended that a visual monitoring device that indicates directional inward airf low be provided at the animal room entry. The ABSL -3 animal facility shall be designed such that under failure conditions the airflow will not be reversed. Audible alarms should be considered to notify personnel of ventilation and HVAC system failure. 7. Internal facility appurtenances, such as light fixtures, air ducts, and utility pipes, are arranged to minimize horizontal surface areas, to facilitate cleaning and minimize the accumulation of debris or fomites. 8. Floor drains must be maintained and filled with water, and/or appropriate disinfectant to prevent the migration of vermin and gases. 9. Cages are washed in a mechanical cage washer. The mechanical cage washer has a final rinse temperature of at least 180\u00b0F. Cages should be autoclaved or otherwise decontaminated prior to removal from ABSL -3 space. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 92 | P a g e The cage wash facility should be designed and constructed to accommodate high pressure spray systems, humidity, strong chemical disinfectants and 180\u00b0F water temperatures, during the cage cleaning process. 10. Illumination is adequate for all activities, avoiding reflections and glare that could impede vision. 11. BSCs (Class II, Class III) must be installed so that fluctuations of the room air supply and exhaust do not interfere with its proper operations. Class II BSCs should be located away from doors, heavily traveled laboratory areas, and other possible airflow disruptions. HEPA filtered exhaust air from a Class II BSC can be safely re -circulated back into the laboratory envir onment if the cabinet is tested and certified at least annually and operated according to manufacturer's recommendations. BSCs can also be connected to the laboratory exhaust system by either a thimble (canopy) connection or a direct (hard) connection. Provisions to assure proper safety cabinet performance and air system operation must be verified. BSCs should be certified at least annually to assure correct performance. Class III BSCs must supply air in such a manner that prevents positive pressur ization of the cabinet or the laboratory room. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 93 | P a g e All BSCs should be used according to manufacturers' recommendations. When applicable, equipment that may produce infectious aerosols must be contained in devices that exhaust air through HEPA filtration or other equivalent technology before being discharged into the animal facility. These HEPA filters should be tested and/or replaced at least annually. 12. An autoclave is available which is convenient to the animal rooms where the biohazard is contained. The autoclave is utilized to decontaminate infectious materials and waste before moving it to the other areas of the facility. If not convenient to areas where infectious materials and/or animals are housed or are manipulated, special practices should be developed for transport of infectious materials designated alternate location/s within the facility. 13. Emergency eyewash and shower are readily available; location is determined by risk assessment. 14. The ABSL -3 facility design and operational p rocedures must be documented. The facility must be tested to verify that the design and operational parameters have been met prior to use. Facilities should be re -verified at least annually against these procedures as modified by operational experience. 15. Additional environmental protection (e.g., personnel showers, HEPA filtration of exhaust air, containment of other piped services, and the provision or Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 94 | P a g e effluent decontamination) should be considered if recommended by the agent summary statement, as determined by risk assessment of the site conditions, or other applicable federal, state or local regulations. Animal Biosafety Level 4 Animal Biosafety Level 4 is required for work with animals infected with dangerous and exotic agents that pose a hig h individual risk of life -threatening disease, aerosol transmission, or related agent with unknown risk of transmission. Agents with a close or identical antigenic relationship to agents requiring ABSL -4 containment must be handled at this level until sufficient data are obtained either to confirm continued work at this level, or to re -designate the level. Animal care staff must have specific and thorough training in handling extremely hazardous, infectious agents and infected animals. Animal care staff m ust understand the primary and secondary containment functions of standard and special practices, containment equipment, and laboratory design characteristics. All animal care staff and supervisors must be competent in handling animals, agents and procedur es requiring ABSL -4 containment. Access to the animal facility within the ABSL -4 laboratory is controlled by the animal facility director and/or laboratory supervisor in accordance with institutional policies. There are two models for ABSL -4 laboratories: (1) A Cabinet Laboratory where all handling of agents, infected animals and housing of infected animals must be performed in Class III BSCs (See Appendix A). (2) A Suit Laboratory where personnel must wear a positive pressure protective Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 95 | P a g e suit (See Appendix A); infected animals must be housed in ventilated enclosures with inward directional airflow and HEPA filtered exhaust; infected animals should be handled within a primary barrier system, such as a Class II BSC or other equivalent containmen t system. ABSL -4 builds upon the standard practices, procedures, containment equipment, and facility requirements of ABSL -3. However ABSL -4 cabinet and suit laboratories have special engineering and design features to prevent microorganisms from being di sseminated into the environment and personnel. The ABSL -4 cabinet laboratory is distinctly different from an ABSL -3 laboratory containing a Class III BSC. Animal Biosafety Level 4 is beyond the scope of current practice here at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Refer to the BMBL for further information on BSL -4. Part Three: A. Recombinant DNA Research All pratices as recommended under the NIH \" Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules \" are adopted by Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (See: http://www.cdc.gov/od/ohs/biosfty/bmbl5/bmbl5toc.htm . The School receives funding from NIH grants, and as a recipient , must adhere to these and other NIH regulations. The NIH asserts that all research, NIH -funded and Non -NIH funded must be conducted in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Office of Biotechnology Activities, and that this Office is the entity charged wit h oversight and regulation of all recombinant DNA activities in the United States. The \" Guidelines \" have specific sections addressing risk assessment with respect to the hazards associated with the manipulation of microorganisms. Appendices \"A\", \"B\", \"G\", \"H\", and Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 96 | P a g e \"K\" should be reviewed and understood completely before designing experiments. Specific transgenic animal and human gene therapy protocols require ISM -MS Institutional Biosafety Committee review and approval. Gene Therapy protocols and product de velopment (INDs) require both NIH and FDA review and approval before initiation of any activity or enrollment of human subjects. B. Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Hepatitis B Virus, and Other Potentially Infectious Material (Bloodborne Pathogens) The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) have issued specific regulations governing the materials identified under this heading in 29 CFR is an enforceable standard with very specific requirements for research involving these materials . All research using human -derived t issues and body fluids requires full compliance with the Standard (Universal) Precautions at a minimum. Projects utilizing HIV, HBV viruses must be conducted in accordance with section 29 CFR 1910.1030 (e) (1) -(5). It is to be noted, that although the speci fic CDC and NIH Guidelines referred to through out this manual do not have force of law the same as the OSHA Standards, OSHA can invoke the \"General Duty Clause\" to apply these guidelines as \"consensus standards\" and can issue citations and levy fines agai nst the School for each infraction uncovered. C. CULTURE PROCEDURES Long -Term Tissue Culture Concern has been expressed in the literature by several researchers over the possibility of acquir ing infections from the manipulati on of tissue cultures and established cell lines. While there is still uncertainty as to whether such infections can occur, a common -sense approach to handling tissue cultures is to consider these materials as other potentially infectious materials , and to use biological safety cabinets and other aerosol prevention practices . Most often the cabinets are used to keep cultures uncontaminated, but in addition to this, a greater part of the hazards of aerosol generation are also reduced. All laboratory work shoul d be performed using the practices specified Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 97 | P a g e under Biosafety Level 2, at a minimum. If the cell line is developed from human cells, OSHA would regulate all manipulations under the Bloodborne Pathogen Standard , www.osha.g ov The standard microbiological practices concerning hygiene, pipette use, waste disposal etc. , as outlined under Biosafety Level 2 , ensure the safety of those workers handling moderately infectious agents. These procedures will also protect against transforming viruses, viruses that are shed in cultures, and the microorganisms found in contaminated cultures. It is recommended that w orkers handling es tablished cell lines identify the viruses that may be present in the cells, and practice the safety procedures specific for that agent listed in Chapter 5 .

BIOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT Risk assessment is an important responsibility for directors and principal investigators of microbiological and biomedical laboratories. Institutional biosafety committees (IBC), animal care and use committees, biological safety professiona ls, and laboratory animal veterinarians share in this responsibility. Risk assessment is a process used to identify the hazardous characteristics of a known infectious or potentially infectious agent or material, the activities that can result in a person' s exposure to an agent, the likelihood that such exposure will cause a LAI, and the probable consequences of such an infection. The information identified by risk assessment will provide a guide for the selection of appropriate biosafety levels and microb iological practices, safety equipment, and facility safeguards that can prevent LAIs. Laboratory directors and principal investigators should use risk assessment to alert their staffs to the hazards of working with infectious agents and to the need for dev eloping proficiency in the use of selected safe practices and containment equipment. Successful control of hazards in the laboratory also protects persons not directly associated with the laboratory, such as other occupants of the same building, and the pu blic. Risk assessment requires careful judgment. Adverse consequences are more likely to occur if the risks are underestimated. By contrast, imposition of safeguards more rigorous than actually needed may result in additional expense and burden for the la boratory, with little safety enhancement. Unnecessary burden may result in circumvention of required safeguards. However, where there is insufficient information to make a clear determination of risk, it is prudent to consider the need for additional safeg uards until more data are available. The primary factors to consider in risk assessment and selection of precautions fall into two broad categories: agent hazards and laboratory procedure hazards. In addition, the capability of the laboratory staff to co ntrol hazards must be considered. This capability will depend on the training, technical proficiency, and good habits of all members of the laboratory, and the operational integrity of containment equipment and facility safeguards. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 105 | P a g e The agent summary state ments contained in BMBL identify the primary agent and procedure hazards for specific pathogens and recommend precautions for their control. The guest editors and contributors of this and previous editions of BMBL based their recommendations on an assessme nt of the risks associated with the handling of pathogens using generally routine generic laboratory procedures. A review of the summary statement for a specific pathogen is a helpful starting point for assessment of the risks of working with that agent an d those for a similar agent. B. HAZARDOUS CHARACTERISTICS OF AN AGENT The principal hazardous characteristics of an agent are: its capability to infect and cause disease in a susceptible human or animal host, its virulence as measured by the severity of disease, and the availability of preventive measures and effective treatments for the disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended an agent risk group classification for laboratory use that describes four general risk groups based on these principal characteristics and the route of transmission of the natural disease.1 The four groups address the risk to both the laboratory worker and the community. The NIH Guidelines established a comparable classification and assigned human etiological a gents into four risk groups on the basis of hazard.2 The descriptions of the WHO and NIH risk group classifications are presented in Table 1. They correlate with but do not equate to biosafety levels. A risk assessment will determine the degree of correlat ion between an agent's risk group classification and biosafety level. See Section 3 for a further discussion of the differences and relatedness of risk groups and biosafety levels. Other hazardous characteristics of an agent include probable routes of tra nsmission of laboratory infection, infective dose, stability in the environment, host range, and its endemic nature. In addition, reports of LAIs are a clear indicator of hazard and often are sources of information helpful for identifying Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 106 | P a g e agent and procedu ral hazards, and the precautions for their control. The absence of a report does not indicate minimal risk. Reports seldom provide incidence data, making comparative judgments on risks among agents difficult. The number of infections reported for a single agent may be an indication of the frequency of use as well as risk. Nevertheless, reporting of LAIs by laboratory directors in the scientific and medical literature is encouraged. Reviews of such reports and analyses of LAIs identified through extensive s urveys are a valuable resource for risk assessment and reinforcement of the biosafety principles. The summary statements in BMBL include specific references to reports on LAIs. The predominant probable routes of transmission in the laboratory are: 1) direct skin, eye or mucosal membrane exposure to an agent; 2) parenteral inoculation by a syringe needle or other contaminated sharp, or by bites from infected animals and arthropod vectors; 3) ingestion of liquid suspension of an infectio us agent, or by contaminated hand to mouth exposure; and 4) inhalation of infectious aerosols. An awareness of the routes of transmission for the natural human disease is helpful in identifying probable routes of transmission in the laborat ory and the potential for any risk to the public health. For example, transmission of infectious agents can occur by direct contact with discharges from respiratory mucous membranes of infected persons, which would be a clear indication that a laboratory w orker is at risk of infection from mucosal membrane exposure to droplets generated while handling that agent. The American Public Health Association publication Control of Communicable Diseases Manual is an excellent reference for identifying both natura l and often noted laboratory modes of transmission.3 Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 107 | P a g e TABLE 3. CLASSIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS MICROORGANISMS BY RISK GROUP RISK GROUP CLASSIFICATION from NIH GUIDELINES FOR RESEARCH INVOLVING RECOMBINANT DNA MOLECULES 2002 (2) WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION LABORATORY BIOSAFETY MANUAL 3RD EDITION 2004 (1) Risk Group 1 Agents that are not associated with disease in healthy adult humans. (No or low individual and community risk) A microorganism that is unlikely to cause human or animal disease. Risk Group 2 Agents that are associated with human disease which is rarely serious and for which preventive or therapeutic interventions are often available. (Moderate individual risk; low community risk) A pathogen that can cause human or animal disease but is unlikely to be a serious hazard to laboratory workers, the community, livestock or the environment. Laboratory exposures may cause serious infection, but effective treatment and preventive measures are available and the risk of spread of infection is limited. Agents that are associated with serious or lethal human disease for which preventive or (High individual risk; low community risk) A pathogen that usually causes serious human or animal Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 108 | P a g e However, it is important to remember tha t the nature and severity of disease caused by a laboratory infection and the probable laboratory route of transmission of the infectious agent may differ from the route of transmission and severity associated with the naturally -acquired disease. 4 An agent capable of transmitting disease through respiratory exposure to infectious aerosols is a serious laboratory hazard, both for the person handling the agent and for other laboratory occupants. This hazard requires special caution because infectious aerosols may not be a recognized route of transmission for the natural disease. Infective dose and agent stability are particularly important in establishing the risk of airborne transmission of disease. For example, the reports of multiple infections in labo ratories associated with the use of Coxiella burnetii are explained by its low inhalation infective dose, which is estimated to be ten inhaled infectious particles, and its resistance to environmental stresses that enables the agent to survive outside of a living host or culture media long enough to become an aerosol hazard. 5 Risk Group 3 therapeutic interventions may be available (high individual risk but low community risk). disease but does not ordinarily spread from one infected individual to another. Effective treatment and preventive measures are available. Risk Group 4 Agents that are likely to cause serious or lethal human disease for which preventive or therapeutic interventions are not usually available (high individual risk and high community risk). (High individual and community risk) A pathogen that usually causes serious human or animal disease and that can be readily transmitted from one individual to another, directly or indirectly. Effective treatment and preventive measures are not usually available.3 Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 109 | P a g e When work involves the use of laboratory animals, the hazardous characteristics of zoonotic agents require careful consideration in risk assessment. Evidence that experimental animals can shed zoonotic agents and other infectious agents under study in saliva, urine, or feces is an important indicator of hazard. The death of a primate center laboratory worker from Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1 (CHV -1, also known as monkey B virus) infect ion following an ocular splash exposure to biologic material from a rhesus macaque emphasizes the seriousness of this hazard. 6 Lack of awareness for this potential hazard can make laboratory staff vulnerable to an unexpected outbreak involving multiple inf ections. 7 Experiments that demonstrate transmission of disease from an infected animal to a normal animal housed in the same cage are reliable indicators of hazard. Experiments that do not demonstrate transmission, however, do not rule out hazard. For exa mple, experimental animals caused many LAIs, rarely infect cagemates.8 The origin of the agent is also important in risk assessment. Non -indigenous agents are of special concern because of their potential to introduce risk of transmission, or spread of human and animal or infectious diseases from foreign countries into the United States. Importation of etiological agents of human disease requires a permit from the CDC. Importation of many etiological agents of livestock, poultry and other animal diseases requires a permit from the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). For additional details see Appendix F. Genetically -modified agent hazards. The identification and assessment of hazardous characteristics of genetically modified agents involve consideration of the same factors used in risk assessment of the wild -type organism. It is particularly important to address the possibility that the genetic modification could increase an agent's pathogenicity or affect its susceptibility to antibiotics or other effective treatments. The risk assessment can be difficult or incomplete, because important information may not be availa ble for a newly engineered agent. Several investigators have reported that they observed unanticipated enhanced virulence in recent studies with engineered agents. 9-12 These observations give reason to remain alert to the possibility that experimental alte ration of virulence genes may lead to Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 110 | P a g e increased risk. It also suggests that risk assessment is a continuing process that requires updating as research progresses. The NIH Guidelines are the key reference in assessing risk and establishing an appropriate b iosafety level for work involving recombinant DNA molecules. 2 The purpose of the NIH Guidelines is to promote the safe conduct of research involving recombinant DNA. The guidelines specify appropriate practices and procedures for research involving constru cting and handling both recombinant DNA molecules and organisms and viruses that contain recombinant DNA. They define recombinant DNA as a molecule constructed outside of a living cell with the capability to replicate in a living cell. The NIH Guidelines explicitly address experiments that involve introduction of recombinant DNA into Risk Groups 2, 3, and 4 agents, and experiments in which the DNA from Risk Groups 2, 3, and 4 agents is cloned into nonpathogenic prokaryotic or lower eukaryotic host -vector systems. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators conducting recombinant DNA research funded by the NIH or performed at, or sponsored by, any public or private entity that receives any NIH funding for recombinant DNA research. Many o ther institutions have adopted these guidelines as the best current practice. The NIH Guidelines were first published in 1976 and are revised on an ongoing basis in response to scientific and policy developments. They outline the roles and responsibiliti es of various entities affiliated with recombinant DNA research, including institutions, investigators, and the NIH. Recombinant DNA research subject to the NIH Guidelines may require: 1) approval by the NIH Director, review by the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC), and approval by the IBC; or 2) review by the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities (OBA) and approval by the IBC; or 3) review by the RAC and approvals by the IBC and Institutional Review Board; or 4) approval by the IBC prior to initiation of the research; or 5) notification of the IBC simultaneous with initiation of the work. It is important to note that review by an IBC is required for all non -exempt experiments as defined by the NIH Guidelines . Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 111 | P a g e The NIH Guidelines were the fir st documents to formulate the concept of an IBC as the responsible entity for biosafety issues stemming from recombinant DNA research. The NIH Guidelines outlines the membership, procedures, and functions of an IBC. The institution is ultimately responsibl e for the effectiveness of the IBC, and may define additional roles and responsibilities for the IBC apart from those specified in the NIH Guidelines . See Appendix J for more information about the NIH Guidelines and OBA. Cell cultures. Workers who handle or manipulate human or animal cells and tissues are at risk for possible exposure to potentially infectious latent and adventitious agents that may be present in those cells and tissues. This risk is well understood and illustrated by the reactivation of herpes viruses from latency, 13,14 the inadvertent transmission of disease to organ recipients, 15,16 and the persistence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HBV, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) within infected individuals in the U.S. population. 17 There also is evidence of accidental transplantation of human tumor cells to healthy recipients which indicates that these cells are potentially hazardous to laboratory workers who handle them. 18 In addition, human and animal cell lines that are not well characteriz ed or are obtained from secondary sources may introduce an infectious hazard to the laboratory. For example, the handling of nude mice inoculated with a tumor cell line unknowingly infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus resulted in multiple LAIs. 19 The potential for human cell lines to harbor a bloodborne pathogen led the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) to interpret that the occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens final rule would include human cell lines. 17 C. HAZARDOUS CHARACTERISTICS OF LABORATORY PROCEDURES Investigations of LAIs have identified five principal routes of laboratory transmission. These are parenteral inoculations with syringe needles or other contaminated sharps, spills and splashes onto skin and mucous membranes, ingestion through mouth pipetting, animal bites and scratches, and inhalation exposures to infectious aerosols. The first four routes of laboratory transmission are easy to detect, but account for less than 20 percent of all reported LAIs. 20 Most reports of such infections do not include information sufficient to identify Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 112 | P a g e the route of transmission of infection. Work has shown that the probable sources of infection \u2014animal or ectoparasite, clinical specimen, agent, and aerosol \u2014are apparent in a pproximately 50 percent of cases. 21 Aerosols are a serious hazard because they are ubiquitous in laboratory procedures, are usually undetected, and are extremely pervasive, placing the laboratory worker carrying out the procedure and other persons in the laboratory at risk of infection. There is general agreement among biosafety professionals, laboratory directors and principal investigators who have investigated LAIs that an aerosol generated by procedures and operations is the probable source of many L AIs, particularly in cases involving workers whose only known risk factor was that they worked with an agent or in an area where that work was done. Procedures that impart energy to a microbial suspension will produce aerosols. Procedures and equipment us ed routinely for handling infectious agents in laboratories, such as pipetting, blenders, non -self contained centrifuges, sonicators and vortex mixers are proven sources of aerosols. These procedures and equipment generate respirable -size particles that re main airborne for protracted periods. When inhaled, these particles are retained in the lungs creating an exposure hazard for the person performing the operation, coworkers in the laboratory, and a potential hazard for persons occupying adjacent spaces open to air flow from the laboratory. A number of investigators have determined the aerosol output of common laboratory procedures. In addition, investigators have proposed a model for estimating inhalation dosage from a laboratory aerosol source. Paramete rs that characterize aerosol hazards include an agent's inhalation infective dose, its viability in an aerosol, aerosol concentration, and particle size. 22, 23, 24 Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 113 | P a g e Procedures and equipment that generate respirable size particles also generate larger size droplets that can contain multiple copies of an infectious agent. The larger size droplets settle out of the air rapidly, contaminating the gloved hands and work surface and possibly the mucous membranes of the persons performing the procedure. An evaluat ion of the release of both respirable particles and droplets from laboratory operations determined that the respirable component is relatively small and does not vary widely; in contrast hand and surface contamination is substantial and varies widely. 25 The potential risk from exposure to droplet contamination requires as much attention in a risk assessment as the respirable component of aerosols. Technique can significantly impact aerosol output and dose. The worker who is careful and proficient will mini mize the generation of aerosols. A careless and hurried worker will substantially increase the aerosol hazard. For example, the hurried worker may operate a sonic homogenizer with maximum aeration whereas the careful worker will consistently operate the de vice to assuring minimal aeration. Experiments show that the aerosol burden with maximal aeration is approximately 200 times greater than aerosol burden with minimal aeration. 22 Similar results were shown for pipetting with bubbles and with minimal bubbl es. Containment and good laboratory practices also reduce this risk. D. POTENTIAL HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH WORK PRACTICES, SAFETY EQUIPMENT AND FACILITY SAFEGUARDS Workers are the first line of defense for protecting themselves, others in the laboratory, and the public from exposure to hazardous agents. Protection depends on the conscientious and proficient use of good microbiological practices and the correct use of safety equipment. A risk assessment should identify any potential deficiencies in the practices of the laboratory workers. Carelessness is the most serious concern, because it can compromise any safeguards of the laboratory and increase the risk for coworkers. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 114 | P a g e Training, experience, knowledge of the agent and procedure hazards, good habits, caution, attentiveness, and concern for the health of coworkers are prerequisites for a laboratory staff in order to reduce the inherent risks that attend work with hazardous agents. Not all workers who join a laboratory staff will have these prer equisite traits even though they may possess excellent scientific credentials. Laboratory directors or principal investigators should train and retrain new staff to the point where aseptic techniques and safety precautions become second nature. 26 There ma y be hazards that require specialized personal protective equipment in addition to safety glasses, laboratory gowns, and gloves. For example, a procedure that presents a splash hazard may require the use of a mask and a face shield to provide adequate prot ection. Inadequate training in the proper use of personal protective equipment may reduce its effectiveness, provide a false sense of security, and could increase the risk to the laboratory worker. For example, a respirator may impart a risk to the wearer independent of the agents being manipulated. Safety equipment such as Biological Safety Cabinets (BSC), centrifuge safety cups, and sealed rotors are used to provide a high degree of protection for the laboratory worker from exposure to microbial aerosols and droplets. Safety equipment that is not working properly is hazardous, especially when the user is unaware of the malfunction. The containment capability of a BSC is compromised by poor location, room air currents, decreased airflow, leaking filters, r aised sashes, crowded work surfaces, and poor user technique. The safety characteristics of modern centrifuges are only effective if the equipment is operated properly. Training in the correct use of equipment, proper procedure, routine inspections and pot ential malfunctions, and periodic re -certification of equipment, as needed, is essential. Facility safeguards help prevent the accidental release of an agent from the laboratory. Their use is particularly important at BSL -3 and BSL -4 because the agents assigned to those levels can transmit disease by the inhalation route or can cause life -threatening disease. For example, one facility safeguard is directional airflow. This safeguard helps to prevent aerosol transmission from a laboratory into other areas of the building. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 115 | P a g e Directional airflow is dependent on the operational integrity of the laboratory's heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. HVAC systems require careful monitoring and periodic maintenance to sustain operational integrity . Loss of directional airflow compromises safe laboratory operation. BSL -4 containment facilities provide more complex safeguards that require significant expertise to design and operate. Consideration of facility safeguards is an integral part of the ris k assessments. A biological safety professional, building and facilities staff, and the IBC should help assess the facility's capability to provide appropriate protection for the planned work, and recommend changes as necessary. Risk assessment may support the need to include additional facility safeguards in the construction of new or renovation of old BSL -3 facilities. E. AN APPROACH TO ASSESS RISKS AND SELECT APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS Biological risk assessment is a subjective process requiring consideratio n of many hazardous characteristics of agents and procedures, with judgments based often on incomplete information. There is no standard approach for conducting a biological risk assessment, but some structure can be helpful in guiding the process. This se ction describes a five -step approach that gives structure to the risk assessment process. First, identify agent hazards and perform an initial assessment of risk. Consider the principal hazardous characteristics of the agent, which include its capability to infect and cause disease in a susceptible human host, severity of disease, and the availability of preventive measures and effective treatments. There are several excellent resources that provide information and guidance for making an initial risk asses sment. The BMBL provides agent summary statements for some agent statements also identify known and suspected routes of transmission of laboratory infection and, when available, information on Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 116 | P a g e infective dose, host range, agent stability in the environment, protective immunizations, and attenuated strains of the agent. A thorough examination of the agent hazards is necessary when the intended use of an agent does not correspond with the general conditions described in the Summary Statement or when an agent summary statement is not available. Although a summary statement for one agent may provide helpful information for assessing the risk of a similar agent, it should not serve as the primary resource for making the risk determina tion for that agent. Refer to other resources for guidance in identifying the agent hazards. The Control of Communicable Diseases Manual (APHA Publication) provides information on communicable diseases including concise summaries on severity, mode of tra nsmission, and the susceptibility and resistance of humans to disease. 3 In addition, it is always helpful to seek guidance from colleagues with experience in handling the agent and from biological safety professionals. Often there is not sufficient inform ation to make an appropriate assessment of risk. For example, the hazard of an unknown agent that may be present in a diagnostic specimen will be unknown until after completing agent identification and typing procedures. It would be prudent in this case t o assume the specimen contains an agent presenting the hazardous classification that correlates with BSL -2 unless additional information suggests the presence of an agent of higher risk. Identification of agent hazards associated with newly emergent pathog ens also requires judgments based on incomplete information. Consult interim biosafety guidelines prepared by the CDC and the WHO for risk assessment guidance. When assessing the hazards of a newly attenuated pathogen, experimental data should support a ju dgment that the attenuated pathogen is less hazardous than the wild -type parent pathogen before making any reduction in the containment recommended for that pathogen. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 117 | P a g e Make a preliminary determination of the biosafety level that best correlates with the initial risk assessment based on the identification and evaluation of the agent hazards. Remember that aerosol and droplet routes of agent transmission also are important considerations in specification of safety equipment and facility design that result in a given BSL level. Second, identify laboratory procedure hazards. The principal laboratory procedure hazards are agent concentration, suspension volume, equipment and procedures that generate small particle aerosols and larger airborne particles (droplet s), and use of sharps. Procedures involving animals can present a number of hazards such as bites and scratches, exposure to zoonotic agents, and the handling of experimentally generated infectious aerosols. The complexity of a laboratory procedure can als o present a hazard. The agent summary statement provides information on the primary laboratory hazards associated with typically routine procedures used in handling an agent. In proposed laboratory procedures where the procedure hazards differ from the gen eral conditions of the agent summary statement or where an agent summary statement is not available, the risk assessment should identify specific hazards associated with the procedures. Third, make a final determination of the appropriate biosafety level and select additional precautions indicated by the risk assessment. The final selection of the appropriate biosafety level and the selection of any additional laboratory precautions require a comprehensive understanding of the practices, safety equipment, and facility safeguards described in Sections 3, 4 and 5 of this publication. There will be situations where the intended use of an agent requires greater precautions than those described in the agent's Summary Statement. These situations will require the careful selection of additional precautions. An obvious example would be a procedure for exposing animals to experimentally generated infectious aerosols. It is unlikely that a risk assessment would indicate a need to alter the recommended facility safegu ards specified for the selected biosafety level. If this does occur, however, it is important that a biological safety professional validate this judgment independently before augmenting any facility secondary barrier. It is also important to recognize th at individuals in the laboratory may differ in their susceptibility to disease. Preexisting diseases, medications, compromised immunity, and pregnancy or breast -feeding that may increase exposure to infants to certain agents, are some of the conditions tha t may increase Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 118 | P a g e the risk of an individual for acquiring a LAI. Consultation with an occupational physician knowledgeable in infectious diseases is advisable in these circumstances. Fourth, evaluate the proficiencies of staff regarding safe practices and th e integrity of safety equipment. The protection of laboratory workers, other persons associated with the laboratory, and the public will depend ultimately on the laboratory workers themselves. In conducting a risk assessment, the laboratory director or pri ncipal investigator should ensure that laboratory workers have acquired the technical proficiency in the use of microbiological practices and safety equipment required for the safe handling of the agent, and have developed good habits that sustain excellen ce in the performance of those practices. An evaluation of a person's training, experience in handling infectious agents, proficiency in the use of sterile techniques and BSCs, ability to respond to emergencies, and willingness to accept responsibility for protecting one's self and others is important insurance that a laboratory worker is capable of working safely. The laboratory director or principal investigator should also ensure that the necessary safety equipment is available and operating properly. F or example, a BSC that is not certified represents a potentially serious hazard to the laboratory worker using it and to others in the laboratory. The director should have all equipment deficiencies corrected before starting work with an agent. Fifth, review the risk assessment with a biosafety professional, subject matter expert, and the IBC. A review of the risk assessment and selected safeguards by knowledgeable individuals is always beneficial and sometimes required by regulatory or funding agencies, a s is the case with the NIH Guidelines .2 Review of potentially high risk protocols by the local IBC should become standard practice. Adopting this step voluntarily will promote the use of safe practices in work with hazardous agents in microbiological and b iomedical laboratories. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 119 | P a g e F. CONCLUSION Risk assessment is the basis for the safeguards developed by the CDC, the NIH, and the microbiological and biomedical community to protect the health of laboratory workers and the public from the risks associated with the use of hazardous biological agents in laboratories. Experience shows that these established safe practices, equipment, and facility safeguards work. New knowledge and experiences may justify altering these safeguards. Risk assessment, however, mus t be the basis for recommended change. Assessments conducted by laboratory directors and principal investigators for the use of emergent agents and the conduct of novel experiments will contribute to our understanding of the risks these endeavors may present and the means for their control. Those risk assessments will likely mirror progress in science and technology and serve as the basis for future revisions of BMBL . REFERENCES 1. Laboratory biosafety manual. 3rd ed.

Refer to the BMBL and NIH Guidelines for more detail. A. Risk Assessment (ref. 6, 10, 13)* Selection of an appropriate biosafety level for work with a particular agent or animal study depends upon a number of factors. Some of the most important are: the virulence, pathogenicity, biological stability, route of spread, and communicability of the agent; the nature or function of the laboratory; the procedures and manipulations involving the agent; the endemicity of the agent; and the availability of effective vaccines or therapeutic measures. Agent Summary Statements are found in the BMBL , and provide guidance for the selection of appropriate biosafety levels. Specific information on laboratory hazards associated with a particular agent, and recommendations regarding practical safeguards that can significantly reduce the risk of laboratory -asso ciated diseases, are included. Agent summary statements are presented for agents which meet one or more of the following criteria: the agent is a proven hazard to laboratory personnel working with infectious materials (e.g., hepatitis B virus, M. tuberculo sis); the potential for laboratory associated infections is high, even in the absence of previously documented laboratory - associated infections (e.g., exotic arboviruses); or, the consequences of infection are grave. Recommendations for the use of vaccine s and toxoids are included in agent summary statements when such products are available, either as licensed or Investigational New Drug (IND) products. When applicable, recommendations for the use of these products are based on current recommendations of t he Public Health Service Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice, and are specifically targeted to at -risk laboratory personnel and others who must work in or enter laboratory areas. These specific recommendations should in no way preclude the routine use of such products as diphtheria -tetanus toxoids, poliovirus vaccine, influenza vaccine and others, because of the potential risk of community exposures irrespective of any laboratory risks. Appropriate precautions should be taken in the administration o f live attenuated virus vaccines in individuals with altered immunocompetence, or other medical condition (e.g., pregnancy), in which a viral infection could result in adverse consequences. Risk assessments (NIH Guidelines ) and biosafety levels recommende d in the agent summary statements (BMBL ) presuppose a population of immunocompetent individuals. Persons with altered immunocompetence may be at a n increased risk when exposed to infectious agents. Immunodeficiency may be hereditary, congenital, or induced by a number of neoplastic or infectious diseases, by therapy, or by radiation. Refer to the following: Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 126 | P a g e http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/index.htm http://osp.od.nih.gov/office -biotechnology -activities/biosafety/nih -guidelines The risk of becoming infected or the consequence of infection may also be influenced by such factors as age, sex, race, pregnancy, surgery (e.g., splenectomy, gastrectomy), predisposing diseases (e.g., diabetes, lupus erythematosus) or altered physiological function. These and other variables must be considered in applying the generic risk assessments of the agent summary statements to specific activities of selected individuals. The biosafety level assigned to an agent is based on the activities typically associated with the growth and manipulation of the quantities and concentrations of infectious agent s required to accomplish identification or typing. If activities with clinical materials pose a lesser risk to personnel than those activities associated with manipulation of cultures, a lower biosafety level is recommended. On the other hand, if the activ ities involve large volumes and/or concentrated preparations (\"production quantities\"), or manipulations which are likely to produce aerosols or which are otherwise intrinsically hazardous, additional personnel precautions and increased levels of primary a nd secondary containment may be indicated. \"Production quantities\" refers to large volumes or concentrations of infectious agents considerably in excess of those typically used for identification and typing activities. Propagation and concentration of inf ectious agents as occurs in large -scale fermentations, antigen and vaccine production, and a variety of other commercial and research activities, clearly deal with significant masses of infectious agents that are reasonably considered \"production quantitie s\". However, in terms of potentially increased risk as a function of the mass of infectious agents, it is not possible to define \"production quantities\" in finite volumes or concentrations for any given agent. Therefore, the laboratory director must make a n assessment of the activities conducted and select practices, containment equipment, and facilities appropriate to the risk, irrespective of the volume or concentration of agent involved. Occasions will arise when the laboratory director should select a biosafety level higher than that recommended. For example, a higher biosafety level may be indicated by the unique nature of the proposed activity (e.g., the need for special containment for experimentally generated aerosols for inhalation studies) or by t he proximity of the laboratory to areas of special concern (e.g., a diagnostic laboratory located near patient care areas). Similarly, a recommended biosafety level may be adapted to compensate for the absence of certain recommended safeguards. For example , in those situations where Biosafety Level 3 is recommended, acceptable safety may be achieved for routine or repetitive operations (e.g., diagnostic procedures involving the propagation of an agent for Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 127 | P a g e identification, typing and susceptibility testing) in laboratories where facility features satisfy Biosafety Level 2 recommendations, provided the recommended Standard Microbiological Practices, Special Practices, and Safety Equipment for Biosafety Level 3 are rigorously followed. One example involves work with the Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (HIVs). Routine diagnostic work with clinical specimens can be done safely at Biosafety Level 2, using Biosafety Level 2 practices and procedures. Research work ( including co -cultivation, virus replication studies, or manipulations involving concentrated virus) can be done in a BSL-2 facility, using BSL -3 practices and procedures. Virus production activities, including virus concentrations, require a BSL -3 facility and use of BSL -3 practices and procedures (see Agent Summary Statement). The decision to adapt Biosafety Level 3 recommendations in this manner should be made only by the laboratory director. This adaptation, however, is not suggested for agent productio n operations or activities where procedures are frequently changing. The laboratory director should also give special consideration to selecting appropriate safeguards for materials that may contain a suspected agent. For example, sera of human origin may contain hepatitis B virus, and therefore, all blood or blood -derived fluids should be handled under conditions which reasonably preclude cutaneous, mucous membrane or parenteral exposure of personnel. Sputa submitted to the laboratory for tubercle bacilli assay should be handled under conditions which reasonably preclude the generation of aerosols during the manipulation of clinical materials or cultures. The infectious agents which meet the previously stated criteria are listed by category of agent in Sec tion VII. To use these summaries, first locate the agent in the listing under the appropriate category of agent. Second, utilize the practices, safety equipment, and type of facilities recommended in the agent summary statement as described in Section VII for working with clinical materials, cultures or infectious agents, or infected animals. The laboratory director is also responsible for appropriate risk assessment and for utilization of appropriate practices, containment equipment, and facilities for agents not included in the agent summary stateme nts. B. CLASSIFICATION OF HUMAN ETIOLOGIC AGENTS ON THE BASIS OF HAZARD Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 128 | P a g e This appendix (Section excerpted from the NIH Guidelines ) includes those biological agents known to infect humans as well as selected animal agents that may pose theoretical risks if inoculated into humans. Included are lists of representative genera and species known to be pathogenic; mutated, recombined, and non-pathogenic species and strains are not considered. Non -infectious life cycle stages of parasites are excluded. This appendix reflects the current state of knowledge and should be considered a resource document. Included are the more commonly encountered agents and is not meant to be all inclusive. Information on agent risk assessment may be found in the Agent Summary Statements of the CDC/NIH publication, Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (see Sections V -C, V -D, V -E, and V-F, Footnotes and References of Sections I through IV .

Risk Group 1 (RG1) Agents RG1 agents are not associated with disease in healthy adult humans. Examples of RG1 agents include asporogenic Bacillus subtilis or Bacillus lich eniformis (see Appendix C -IV- A, Bacillus subtilis or licheniformis Host-Vector Exceptions), coli K-12 (see Appendix coli K-12 Host Vector Systems, Exceptions), adeno -associated virus (AAV) types 1 through 4 , and recombinant AAV constructs, in which the transgene does not encode either a potentially tumorigenic gene product or a toxin molecule and are produced in the absence of a helper virus. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 129 | P a g e Those agents not listed in Risk Groups (RGs) 2, 3 and 4 are not au tomatically or implicitly classified in RG1; a risk assessment must be conducted based on the known and potential properties of the agents and their relationship to agents that are listed. See: Pages 37 - 43 of the NIH Guidelines for specific agents and c orresponding risk groups. See: http://osp.od.nih.gov/office -biotechnology -activities/biosafety/nih -guidelines 2. Risk Group 2 (RG2) Agents RG2 agents are associated with human disease which is rarely serious and for which preventive or therapeutic interventions are often available. 3. Risk Group 3 (RG3) Agents RG3 agents are associated with serious or lethal human disease for which preventive or therapeutic interventions may be available. 4. Risk Group 4 (RG4) Agents RG4 agents are likely to cause serious or lethal human disease for which preventive or therapeut ic interventions are not usually available. 5. Animal Viral Etiologic Agents in Common Use The list of animal etiologic agents is appended to the list of human etiologic agents. None of these agents is associated with disease in healthy adult humans; they are commonly used in laboratory experimental work. A containment level appropriate for RG1 human agents is recommended for their use. For agents that are infectious to human cells, e.g., amphotropic and xenotropic strains of murine leukemia virus, a cont ainment level appropriate for RG2 human agents is recommended. 6.

Murine Retroviral Vectors Murine retroviral vectors to be used for human transfer experiments (less than 10 liters) that contain less than 50% of their respective parental viral genome and that have been demonstrated to be free of detectable replication competent retrovirus can be maintained, handled, and administered, under BL1 containment. 8. Arboviruses The American Committee on Arthropod -borne Viruses (ACAV) registered 535 arboviruses as of December 1991. In 1979, the ACAV's Subcommittee on Arbovirus Laboratory Safety (SALS) categorized each of 424 viruses then registered in the Catalogue of Arboviruses and Certain Other Viruses of Vertebrates into one of four recommended practices, safety equipment, and facilities described in this publication as Biosafety Levels 1 -4 (ref. 6). Since 1980, SALS has periodically updated the 1980 publication by providing a supplemental listing and recommended levels of practice and containment for arboviruses registered since 1979. SALS recommen ded that the work with the majority of these agents should be conducted at the equivalent of Biosafety Level 2. SALS also recognizes five commonly used vaccine strains for which attenuation is firmly established, which may be handled at BSL -2, provided tha t personnel working with these strain are immunized. SALS has classified all registered viruses for which insufficient laboratory experience exists as BSL -3, and reevaluates the classification whenever additional experience is reported.

Disinfectants(ref. 4, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 25) The information presented in this se ction will provide a general guideline for selecting a particular disinfectant for use with a given agent. The best way of ascertaining the suitability of a disinfectant against a particular agent is to challenge that agent with the disinfectant at the manufacturer's recommended concentration, or several concentrations in order to establish a kill curve. In gen eral this is not necessary due to a large body of literature available on many disinfectants, and the manufacturer's own test results which can be obtained in many cases. ( See: https://www.epa.gov/pesticide -registration/selected -epa-registered -disinfectants EPA Registered Disinfectants). A brief description of the mode of action of each class of disinfectant is given below. Although physical methods are often superior to chemical disinfection / sterilization, it is not practical to autoclave or subject many items to high heat, especially if the items can be damaged through repeated exposure to heat. Treatment of inert surfaces and heat labile materials can be a ccomplished through the use of disinfectants, provided that the following factors are considered: concentration of active ingredient, duration of contact between disinfectant and item to be disinfected, pH, temperature, humidity, and the presence of organi c matter or soil load. The interplay of these factors will determine the degree of success in accomplishing either disinfection or sterilization. In all situations, review the manufacturer's recommendations for correct formulation and use. Do not attempt to use a chemical disinfectant for a purpose it was not designed for. B. Disinfectant Groups 1. Aldehydes: (Formaldehyde, Paraformaldehyde, Glutaraldehyde) Formaldehyde and its polymerized solid form, paraformaldehyde, have broad -spectrum biocidal activity and are both effective for surface and space decontamination. Formaldehyde gas is used to decontaminate large spaces and biological safety cabinets, and wh en used with superheated steam, can disinfect a terminal filtration bank. As a Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 134 | P a g e liquid (5% concentration) it is an effective liquid decontaminant. Formaldehyde's drawbacks are reduction in efficacy at refrigeration temperature, its pungent, irritating odor, and several safety concerns. Formaldehyde is presently considered to be a carcinogen or a cancer -suspect agent according to several regulatory agencies. The gas is explosive over a wide range of percentages (7.0 - 73% v/v in air) and has to be used with extreme caution since it has a high vapor pressure. Its biocidal action is through alkylation of carboxyl, hydroxyl and sulfhydryl groups on proteins. Cidex, a commercially prepared buffered glutaraldehyde disinfectant is used routinely for cold surface s terilization of clinical instruments. 2. Halogen -Based Biocides: (Iodine, Chlorine) Both Chlorine and Iodine behave similarly with respect to biocidal activity, by binding to proteins and modifying sulfhydryl, amino, indole and phenolic groups, and gener ally acting as oxidizing agents. Sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) has an available chlorine content of 5.25%, or 52,500 ppm . Because of its oxidizing power, it loses potency quickly and must be made fresh and used within the same day it is prepared. Care must be exercised in using chlorine -based disinfectants which can corrode or damage metal, rubber, and other susceptible surfaces. Free organic matter such as protein, will compete for the chlorine ion against the microbial agent, thereby reducing t he biocidal activity and making the disinfectant organic load dependent. Bleached articles should never be autoclaved without reducing the bleach with sodium thiosulfate or sodium bisulfate. Chloramine T which is prepared from sodium hypochlorite and p -toluenesulfonamide is a more stable, odorless, less corrosive form of chlorine but has decreased biocidal activity in comparison to bleach. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 135 | P a g Wescodyne , Betadyne , Povidone -Iodine and other iodophors are commercially available Iodine -based disinfectants, which give good control when the manufacturer's instructions for formulation and application are followed. Both bleach and iodophors should be made up in cold wate r in order to prevent breakdown of the disinfectant . 3. Quaternary Ammonium Compounds ( Zephirin, CDQ, A -3) These compounds are considered to be cationic detergents and in general are more effective against gram positive bacteria. The \"quarts\" are considered to be more biostatic than biocidal, and are generally ineffective against unenveloped viruses, bacterial spores and Mycobacterium tuberculosis . The activity is reduced when mixed with soaps, detergents, acids and when in the presence of heavy organic matter loads. Basically these compounds are not suitable for any type of terminal disinfection. The mode o f action of the \"quats\" is through membrane damage and leakage, followed by protein denaturation Many of these compounds are better used in water baths, incubators, and other applications where halide or phenolic residues are not desired. The quaternary ammonium compounds are widely used as surface disinfectants. There have been some reports of health care -associated infections associated with con - taminated quaternary ammonium compounds used to disinfect patient care supplies or equipment such as cystosco pes or cardiac catheters. As with several other dis -infectants (e.g., phenolics, iodophors), gram -negative bacteria have been found to survive or grow in them. Results from manufacturers' data sheets and from published scientific literature indicate that the quaternaries sold as hospital disinfectants are generally fungicidal, bactericidal, and virucidal against lipophilic (enveloped) viruses; they are not sporicidal and generally not tuberculocidal or virucidal against hydrophilic (nonenveloped) viruses. Poor mycobactericidal activities of quaternary ammonium compounds have been reported. The quaternaries are commonly used in ordinary environmental sanitation of noncritical surfaces such as floors, furniture, and walls. EPA -registered quaternary ammonium compounds are appropriate to use when disinfecting medical equipment that comes into contact with intact skin (e.g., blood pressure cuffs).

Weber, in Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett's Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases (Eighth Edition) , 2015 4. Phenolics: ( O -phenophenoate -base Compounds) These biocides act through membrane damage and are effective against enveloped viruses, rickettsiae, fungi and vegetative bacteria. They are not as adversely affected by organic loads as other disinfectants. Cresols, hexachlorophene, alkyl - and chloro - derivatives and diphenyls are more active than phenol itself. Available commercial products are Amphyl, O -syl, Tergisyl, Lysol, Vesphene, L -Phase and Expose. 5. Acids / Alkalis: Strong mineral acids and alkalis have disinfectant properties proportional to the extent of their dissociation in solution. Some hydroxides are more effective than would be predicted from their values. In general acids are better disinfectants than alkalis. Mode of action is attributed to an increase of H+ and OH- species in solutio ns which interfere with certain microbial functions, however the total effect is not only dependent on pH alone. Weak organic acids are more potent than inorganic acids despite low dissociation rates in solution. Action is attributed to the disruption of 2o and 3o conformation of enzymes and structural proteins. 6. Heavy Metals: Soluble salts of mercury, silver lactate, mercuric chloride and efficient bactericidal agents. and mercuric chloride are commonly used as 1:1000 aqueous solutions. Action is through attack on protein sulfhydryl groups and Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 137 | P a g e disruption of enzyme functions. Organic matter can reverse the disinfectant properties of mercurials. 7. Alcohols: Alcohols work through the disruption of cellular membranes, so lubilization of lipids, and denaturation of proteins by acting directly on S -H functional groups. The compounds are effective against lipid -containing viruses and a broad spectrum of bacterial species, but ineffective against spore -forming bacteria. They can be combined with phenolics and iodine to enhance activity. They evaporate quickly, and leave no residue, but evaporation interferes with contact time unless the article is immersed in the alcohol. Alcohols are generally regarded as being non -corrosive. Higher molecular weight alcohols are more effective but are less miscible with water, which is required for adequate effectiveness. Ethanol and isopropanol are used as 70 - 80% aqueous solutions. Absolute alcohols are not as effective indicating that some water is required in the disinfection process. 8. EPA List ed Disinfectants EPA regulates pesticides under the statutory authority of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). The registration requirements for antimicrobial pesticides differ somewhat from those of other pesticides. EPA maintains a list of approved disinfectants, and specifically indicates what microorganisms the disinfectant is effective against. Each disinfectant must have an EPA registration number posted on the container and specify what microbes it is effective against. The following lis ts of antimicrobial products registered by the EPA for healthcare use are effective against the most common emerging pathogens, as indicated in the list titles. EPA-registered antimicrobial products may not make efficacy claims against these pathogens unle ss the agency has reviewed data to support the claim and approved the claim on the label. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 138 | P a g e Use of the listed EPA -registered products must be consistent with the product labeling and complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's requirements for Occupational Exposure to blood borne Pathogens (29 CFR 1910) . The following website has listed agents by categories as of October, 2014: http://www.epa.gov/oppad001/chemregindex.htm . C. Sterilization 1. Autoclave: Autoclaving at a temperature of 121o C (steam under pressure) at 20 psi is one of the most convenient and effective means of sterilization available. Care must be taken to ensure that the steam can circulate around articles in order to provide even heat distribution. The success of the sterilization is ver y time -dependent in liquid media, with large volumes requiring longer periods of time to reach the effective temperature within the media itself. Additionally, there should be no void spaces in the load that could insulate against the steam --this condition could prevent the transference of heat to the vessels resulting in no sterilization of the contents. In dry loads small amounts of water (50 -75 cc's per 30 gallon bag) should be included inside the autoclave bag to ensure sufficient moisture content with in the load to allow for heat transference and distribution. It is recommended that a Diack, or commercially available Geobacillus stearothermophilis or Bacillus subtilis var. niger test strips be used periodically to validate and document the killing ef ficiency of the autoclave. This is critically important if the autoclave is used for the sterilization of pathogenic cultures. Autoclave tape can be used for routine runs where glassware or sterile media are prepared before use. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 139 | P a g e 2. Dry Heat: Ovens operatin g at 160o - 170o C for periods of 2 -4 hours are efficient for sterilizing glassware, or other non -porous heat conductive materials. It is unsatisfactory for organic and inorganic materials that can act as insulation and is also unsuitable for heat labile materials. Incineration is a very effective means of final sterilization and disposal, and is also used for \"spot\" sterilization of inoculating needles and loops as well as flaming glassware during microbiological culturing procedures. Care has to be exer cised when flaming \"charged\" items, since this practice can release infectious microaerosols through spattering. 3. Radiation: Ionizing radiation is not used for general laboratory sterilization, however ultraviolet radiation (U.V.) is used to control airborne microorganisms and environmental surface decontamination. Ultraviolet sources are used in biological safety cabinets for partial contamination control. This form of control is extremely limited due its poor penetrating power, susceptibility to air movement, requirement for long contact time periods, and has not been documented as an effective control method. 4. Vapors and Gases : From a practical point of view, formaldehyde, beta -propiolactone and ethylene oxide are not routinely used in laboratory sterilization practices. These sterilants are used in hospitals and commercial facilities where closed systems controlling temperatu re, humidity, and concentration are required to achieve sterilization using these agents. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 140 | P a g e Biological safety cabinets are decontaminated using paraformaldehyde heated to decomposition in order to release formaldehyde gas. This procedure should be performe d only by personnel trained in this procedure due to the explosive nature of Formaldehyde. Of the sterilants listed above, Ethylene Oxide (ETO) has wide use as an alkyl ting agent with very broad biocidal activity including spores and viruses. Because of its toxicity and potential carcinogenicity, it is not used today. Instruments and optics that may be damaged by other sterilization methods, rooms, buildings and air -handling systems in particular are also sterilized using these sterilants. All of these sterilants are extremely toxic, and are regulated under OSHA and EPA regulations. As a final note, the desired result for any treatment is to arrive at a significant reduction in the numbers of infectious entities (several orders of magnitude or logs of r eduction), with the final result that there is no longer a risk of acquiring an infection while handling the materials after treatment. Complete sterility with the exception of media preparation and the disposal of some highly infectious agents, is not req uired for the disposal of infectious waste. D.

The preparation as formulated at a given concentration was tested using AOAC test methods, and has been documented as effective at that concentration against the microorganisms used in th e assay. Revised: 9/2018 Pgh: Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 142 | P a g e Chapter 7: The Biological Safety Cabinet Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 143 | P a g e The Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) (ref. 5, 6, 11, 12, 20, 21, 22) Biological Safety Cabinets (BSCs) are among the most effective, as well as most commonly used primary containment devices in laboratories working with infectious agents. The three general types available (Classes I, II, and III) have different performance characteristics as described below. The type of cabinet to use will depend on application , type of agents to be used in the lab, and whether product sterility, personal protection, or both are critical considerations in the research environment. Properly maintained Class I and II BSCs when used in conjunction with good microbiological techniq ues, provide a very effective containment system for the safe manipulation of low to moderate risk microorganisms (Risk Groups 1 and 2). Both Class I and II BSCs have inward face velocities (75 -100 linear feet per minute*) that provide comparable levels of containment for laboratory workers and the immediate environment from infectious aerosols generated within the cabinet. Class II BSCs have the additional advantage of providing protection to the research material by HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) - filtration of the air flowing down over and across the work surface (vertical laminar flow). Class III cabinets offer the maximum protection to laboratory personnel, the surrounding community and the environment because all hazardous materials are conta ined in a totally enclosed, ventilated cabinet. A. Biological Safety Cabinet Classes 1. Class I BSCs (Figure 2 ) Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 144 | P a g e Note: Class I BSCs are no longer manufactured on a regular basis; many are being replaced by the Class II BSC's. The Class 1 biological Safety Cabinet is an open -fronted negative -pressure ventilated cabinet with a minimum inward face velocity of at least 75 lf/m*. All of the air exhausted from the cabinet is discharged through a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA ) filter either into the laboratory or directly outside. This cabinet is designed for general microbiological research with low and moderate risk agents , and is useful containment of mixers, blenders, and other equipment. The Class I BSCs are not appropria te for handling research materials that are vulnerable to airborne contamination, since the inward flow of unfiltered air from the laboratory can carry microbial contaminants into the cabinet. Material in this chapter is developed principally from ref.6 a nd http://www.cdc.gov/od/ohs/biosfty/bsc/bsc.htm 2. Class II BSCs (Figures 3, 5a, 5b, 6, 7) The Class II BSC is des igned with an inward airflow at a velocity of between 75 - 100 lf/m, and a downward, vertical laminar flow in order to provide an air curtain barrier to protect the user from materials within and to protect materials within the cabinet from contamination origin ating outside the cabinet. All internal air is cleaned by flowing through HEPA filters prior to discharge within the laboratory, or through a duct system to the external environment. Design, construction and performance standards for Class II BSCs as well as a list of products that meet the NSF 49 Standard are available from the National Sanitation Foundation, International, Ann Arbor, Michigan. Utilization for this standard and the corresponding list of approved models should be a first step in selecting a nd purchasing a Class II BSC. Class II BSCs are classified into two sub categories, A and B respectively, based on design configurations, construction, air flow velocities and exhaust systems used. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 145 | P a g e Basically, a Class II Type A cabinet is suitable for work with microbiological research in the absence of volatile or toxic chemicals and radionuclides, since the exhaust air is recirculated within the work area. Type A cabinets may be exhausted through HEPA filters into the laboratory, or more preferably to t he outside air by use of a \"thimble\" connection to an exhaust duct system. Type B cabinets are further divided into 3 subtypes - B1, B2 and B3. A comparison of their design features and applications are found in Table 5 of this chapter. Type B cabinets a re often hard -ducted to an exhaust system and usually contain all negative pressure plena within (no internal plena are under positive pressure). These features, plus an increased face velocity of100 lf/m allow work to be done with toxic chemicals, carcino gens, radionuclides, and moderate -to -high risk microorganisms. Some manufacturers are producing a hybrid category, the Class II Type A / B3 which will assume the characteristics of a B3 when connected to a duct, and otherwise is operated as a Type A when standing alone. (A thimble is a canopy hood with design dimensions that allow the discharge from the BSC to be captured efficiently and transported through a duct system, while allow sufficient make -up air from the laboratory to enter simultaneously s o that the system is not starved for air. This duct system has a terminal fan and usually an additional HEPA filter before the fan -see Figure 4). 3. Class III BSCs (Figure 8) The Class III cabinet is a totally enclosed ventilated cabinet of gas -tight c onstruction and offers the highest degree of personal and environmental protection from infectious aerosols as well as protection of research materials from microbiological contaminants. Class III cabinets are most suitable for work with hazardous agents t hat require Biosafety Level 3 or 4.containment. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 146 | P a g e All operations within the work area of the Class III cabinet are conducted through attached rubber gloves. When in use the Class III BSC is maintained under negative air pressure of at least 0.5 inches water gauge. Supply air is HEPA -filtered and the exhausted cabinet air is filtered by two HEPA filters installed in series, or HEPA filtration followed by incineration before discharge outside of the facility. Usually several BSCs are connected together to form a cabinet line. All equipment required by the laboratory activity such as incubators, refrigerators and centrifuges must be an integral part of the cabinet system and included within the cabinet line. The Class III BSC must be connected to double door aut oclaves and chemical dunk tanks in order to sterilize or disinfect all materials exiting the cabinet and to allow supplies to enter the cabinet line. As with any other piece of laboratory equipment, personnel must be trained in the proper use of the BSC. Of particular note are those activities which may disrupt the inward directional flow through the work opening (face) of the Class I and II cabinet. Repeated insertion of the worker's arms into the work area, or briskly walking past a BSC while it is in us e, are demonstrated causes of the release of aerosolized from within the cabinet. Class I and II BSCs should be located away from traffic patterns and doorways to the lab. Fans, heating and air conditioning registers and other air handling devices can also disrupt airflow patterns if located too close to the cabinet. Strict adherence to the recommended practices for the use of the BSC and proper placement of the BSC within the laboratory are important in attaining the maximum containment available from cabinet. It is imperative that the Class I and II BSCs have periodic testing of the cabinet, motor and flow dynamics to ensure the continued safe operation of the BSC. Cabinets are usually evaluated when first installed in the lab, and at least annually in co nformance to the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Standard. Cabinets should also be tested when moved or relocated to another laboratory. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 147 | P a g e B. Recommendations for Effective use of BSCs ( ref.11) 1. Even though the cabinet is tested prior to shipping by the manufacturer, upon arrival in the lab the cabinet should be tested to ensure that no damage to the filter system resulted in shipment. 2. The overall integrity and function of the unit should be checked on a yearly basis, especially when pathogens requiring Biosafety Level 2 containment (or higher) are in use. This is currently required by OSHA in the Bloodborne Pathogen Standard, 29 CFR 1910.1030. (e)(2)(iii)(A) . http://www.osha -slc.gov/OshStd_data/1910_1030.html 3. Adequate space use of the cabinet should be planned to prevent over -crowding or restriction of movement in the cabinet. 4. The BSC should be allowed to operate five minutes before manipulations are initiate d. This allows removal of any possible contaminated air that may have entered while breeching the air -barrier. Insertion of hands and equipment causes turbulence at point of entry, mixing clean air with dirty air. 5. Interior surfaces should be wiped down wi th 70% alcohol at the beginning end and at the end of the day. If equipped with a UV light, this should be turned on at the end of the day, and turned off while operating. 6. All equipment to be used should be brought inside the cabinet before starting up the cabinet's internal barrier. 7. Do not place anything over the front grill, especially if sterility is necessary. A substantial portion of the air is contaminated (make -up air for the exhaust), and therefore this practice defeats one of the features of the cabinet. 8. Learn to work deep in the interior of the cabinet at least four inches from the intake grill. This prevents contamination of the work, and eliminates spillage of liquids into interior surfaces of the cabinet through the grills. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 148 | P a g e 9. Personnel movemen t near the cabinet front should be kept to a minimum. Ideally, a separate room with a door will reduce the chances of disturbing air -barrier flow. Movement at the hood face should be minimal, with all movements made slowly so that the airflow at the face o f the BSC is not disturbed. 10. The use of centrifuges, open flames, and shakers should be performed with care, since these activities disturb air -flow in the cabinet, and can breech the air -barrier . Note: Open flames can damage HEPA filters through heat build -up within the cabinet. 11. The B iological Safety Cabinet is not a substitute for good microbiological technique. Proper practice of aseptic technique and tissue culture techniques is essential to ensure proper safety when using the BSC. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 149 | P a g e Table 5.

This not only applies to chemicals, but to viral agents as well, some of which have been linked to oncogenic activity in the literature. Special care has to be exercised in the use of known or suspect carcinogens and mutagens that may be used in research procedures. Due to many intricate interactions involving dose, route of exposure, metabolic uptake and processing , pres ence of promoters, etc. it is nearly impossible to accurately predict what the outcome of an exposure may be. Much attention has been given to the dan gers of carcinogenic agents in the popular media, causing exaggerated concern in some individuals, and a lack of concern in others. Many of these accounts are based on preliminary evidence or on retrospective case studies of human exposures. A cautious att itude and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment and engineering controls is highly recommended in all manipulations of known carcinogens and cancer -suspect agents. An understanding of the hazards, risks and the protective equipment and pra ctices available will serve the researcher well in reducing or eliminating potential exposures in laboratory procedures . The following guidelines, which were adapted from two sources available from the NIH, are given in order to provide an informed approac h to the safe handling of carcinogens. Currently, OSHA regulates the laboratory use of any chemical, including carcinogens under 29 CFR 1910.1450 The Laboratory Standard , and requires the development of a written Standard Operating Procedure that outlines the use, storage and disposal steps to be used for each carcinogen in each project. A definition of a standard operating procedure (SOP) is as follows: Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 164 | P a g e standard operating procedure n. 1. Established procedure to be followed in carrying out a given operation or in a given situation. 2. A specific procedure or set of procedures so established. The American Heritage\u00ae Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition copyright \u00a92000 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Updated in 2009. Published by Houghton Mifflin Company . All rights reserved. To put it into laboratory terms, an SOP is your Materials and Methods practices for each protocol / project you participate in, with all of the safety and personal protective equipment and engineering controls you will need to do your job safely specified out. All steps in handling a microorganism, chemical or toxin are wri tten out so as to track the material \"from cradle to grave\", eliminating potential miscommunications and utilizing forethought of how to dispose of the material well in advance of actually needing disposal. A. Oncogenic Virus Guidelines The general precautions recommended for Biosafety Level 2 are also adequate for work involving oncogenic viruses. No guidelines for high risk viruses are given since no agents in this category have been identified to date. Notification of a change in risk evaluation for a virus would be reported by the NIH on its Office of Safety Policy web site, https://osp.od.nih.gov/ , and would appear in the publication NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules ( NIH Guidelines ) B. Chemical Carcinogens a. Personnel Practices Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 165 | P a g e 1. Laboratory clothing that protects street cl othing such as fully fastened laboratory coats or disposable jumpsuits are to be worn. Gloves, suitable to the hazard (i.e. chemically resistant) should be worn. 2. Laboratory clothing dedicated to carcinogen use is to be worn only in handling areas, and is not to be worn outside these areas at any time. 3. Laboratory clothing is to be decontaminated prior to disposal or laundering. Disposable gloves should also be decontaminated before discarding. If the decontamination procedure for a given chemical is not kn own, all protective equipment should be of the disposable type, and should be discarded at the end of the procedure. Contact the Biosafety Officer for assistance in arranging discard of these materials. 4. Eating, drinking, and smoking are not permitted in a ny laboratories where carcinogens are in use. In addition, gum chewing, tobacco chewing, application of cosmetics, storage of utensils, food and food containers, or any activity that promotes hand to mouth / face contact is not permitted. It is recommended that glasses be substituted for contact lenses while working with carcinogens. 5. All personnel should wash their hands immediately after completion of handling chemical carcinogens, and at the conclusion of the work day activities. b. Laboratory Practices 1. For laboratories using the carcinogens listed in Table 4 intermittently and within the specified amounts as indicated, each storage container of chemical carcinogens should be clearly marked \"CAUTION -CARCINOGENIC AGENT\" . Laboratories using any of the carci nogens listed or any other cancer -suspect or toxic chemical should contact the Biosafety Officer in order to determine what other signs or labels may be required for the laboratory. 2. Access to the laboratory and storage areas is strictly restricted to the Principal Investigator and his/her research and support staff. 3. Maintenance and other responders such as Security Officers must be advised of any potential hazards they may encounter in the laboratory before making entry. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 166 | P a g e 4. Doors to work areas and storage a reas of chemical carcinogens are to be closed at all times while experiments are in progress. 5. All work surfaces on which chemical carcinogens are used are to be covered with stainless steel trays, plastic trays, dry absorbent, plastic -backed paper or othe r similarly impervious material in order to prevent permanent contamination of the work sites. 6. Depending on the material used, decontamination or disposal of coverings should be performed at the end of procedures or at the end of the day's activities. 7. Chemical carcinogens should not be used on the open bench top, but are to be used only in glove boxes; sealed systems within a single pass ducted chemical fume hood, Class II B2 Biological Safety Cabinets (BSC), or other enclosed systems. Aerosol prevention measures are to be practiced at all times. 8. Tissue culture work involving chemical carcinogens may be conducted in a Class II Type B BSC, or in a Class II A / B3 BSC provided that the BSC's are thimble connected into a single -pass, ducted ventilation syste m that discharges directly to the external environment. 9. Vapors or aerosols produced by analytical instruments when used with chemical carcinogens should be captured by a local exhaust system at the work site, or by using such instruments in chemical hoods or Biological Safety cabinets vented as described above. 10. Any use of respirators by personnel must conform to the OSHA Standards regulating training, proper wearing, fit -testing, medical evaluation and surveillance, proper storage and use of respirators, (29 CFR 1910.134 at www.osha.gov .)

There are presently five subcategories of RMW: Cultures and Stocks Human Pathological Waste. Human Blood and Blood Products. Sharps Animal Waste B. EPA MEDICAL INFECTIOUS WASTE: The EPA definition states: \"Medical/infectious waste means any waste generated in the diagnosis, treatment or immunization of human beings, or animals, in research pertaining thereto, or in the production or testing of biologicals that is listed in paragraphs [2.1] through [2.7] of this definition. The definition does not include hazardous waste identified or listed under the regulations in part 261 of this chapter; household waste, as defined in 261.4 (b) (1) of this chapter; ash from incineration of medical / infectious waste, once the incineration process has been completed; human corpses, remains and anatomical parts that are intended for internment; and domestic sewage materials identified in 261.4 (a) (1) of this chapter. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 171 | P a g e 1. Cultures and stocks of infectious agents and associated biologicals, including: cultures from pathological laboratories; cultures and stocks of infectious agents from research and industrial laboratories; wastes from the production of biologicals; discarded live and attenuat ed vaccines; and culture dishes and devices used to transfer, inoculate, and mix cultures. 2. Human pathological waste* , including tissues, organs, and body fluids that are removed during surgery of autopsy, or other medical procedures, and specimens of body fluids and their containers. 3. Human blood and blood products* including: a. Liquid waste human blood; b. Products of blood; c. Items saturated and/or dripping with human blood; or d. Items that were saturated and/or dripping with human blood that are now caked with dried human blood; including serum, plasma, and other blood components and their containers, which were used or intended for use in either patient care, testing and laboratory analysis or the development of pharmaceuticals. Intravenous bags are also included in this category. 4. Sharps that have been used in animal or human patient care or treatment or in medical, research, or industrial laboratories, including hypodermic needles, syringes (with or without the attached needle), Pasteur pipettes, scalpel blades, blood vials, needles with attached tubing, glass slides and cover slips and culture dishes (regardless of presence of infectious agents). Also included are other types of broken or unbroken glassware that were in contact with infectious Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 172 | P a g e agents, such as used slides and cover slips. SESIP s -(Sharps with Engineered Sharps Injury Protection) are include d, since t hey are \"medical\" in appearance and still look like needles -which they are. 5. Animal waste including contaminated animal carcasses, body parts, and bedding of animals that were known to have been exposed to infectious agents during research (including re search in veterinary hospitals), production of biologicals or testing or pharmaceuticals. 6. Isolation wastes* including biological waste and discarded materials contaminated with blood, excretions, exudates, or secretions from humans who are isolated to protect others from certain highly communicable diseases, or isolated animals known to be infected with highly communicable diseases. 7. Unused sharps including the following unused discarded sharps; hypodermic needles, suture needles, syringes and scalpe l blades. \" C. WASTE COLLECTION Areas used to stage RMW, NRMW, chemo and recyclables must be kept clean and free of clutter and allow easy access to all waste containers. RMW and chemo containers must be kept in restricted areas which limit exposure to the public. All radioactive waste (RMW, NRMW, and linen) must be stored in the p roper containers and stored consistent with Department of Radiation Safety requirements . The Department of Radiation Safety must be notified to remove these items . Containers used to store RMW must be red in color or be labeled with the words Regulated Medical Waste or Infectious Waste or use the Universal BioHazardous symbol. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 173 | P a g e These containers must be kept covered and free of visible soil. Containers used to store chemo waste must be labeled to identify chemo waste. Chemo containers must be kept covered and free of visible soil. RMW and NRMW waste will be removed from the unit's waste staging area on a daily basis by the Department of Waste Management (ext. 4 5015). The Department of Waste Management will line all red bag waste containers with red bags provided on the unit and replace all chemo containers removed from the unit. D. RECYCLABLES Cardboard and white paper are the two items that the hospital recycles. The Building Services support staff are responsible for flattening all cardboard and removing all white papers from their recycling bins on a daily basis and placing them in the unit's waste staging area. They are not to be thrown down the trash chutes. The Department of Waste Management will remove these two items from the unit's waste staging area on a daily basis. E. SHARPS All sharps (See: B.4 above) (needles and glass) are to be p laced in a sharps container after use. Sharps containers are either wall mounted or free standing and are labeled Bio -hazardous material. These sharps containers are emptied several times per week by Steri-Cycle , an outside company under contract with the hospital. All employees should contact the technicians at pager 41300 then 4640 # or 4639 # if a sharps container is filled, missing or dismantled from the wall. For the Medical School's use of the term \"SHARP\": any glass, metal, plastic instrument or item that can cut or has the potential to cut, puncture, scratch or abrade skin, whether it is contaminated or not, is to be handled as a SHARP and disposed of in the provided rigid puncture resistant box. If you hav e any doubt, place it in the sharps box. If it hard....put it in the sharps box; if soft, put it in a red bag. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 174 | P a g e If an infectious agent has been manipulated with the items under consideration, they must be autoclaved or disinfected prior to being placed into the sharps boxes. Research quantities of microbial agents can present numbers of organisms several times over a potentially infectious dose to an individual coming into contact with the needle box or its contents. If these items are being used in clinica l-type applications they may be disposed of in the sharps needle boxes without treatment. Consideration should be given to the fact that the sharps needle boxes receive no treatment until reaching the service company's facilities and therefore infectious material may remain viable within these boxes. Autoclaving or disinfecting infectious materials, prior to disposal, and arranging for the timely removal of boxes from the laboratory will provide for a safer work environment. All medical school employ Iees handling human blood, tissues and body fluids should be thoroughly familiar with the ISM-MS \"Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure Control OSHA's 29 CFR.1910.10. at https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/bloodbornepathogens/index.html and should dispose of related items as described in the entire Section (d) (4) (iii) \"Regulated Waste \" procedures. Employees handling HIV, HBV, or other pathogenic agents must follow the procedures outlined in the \"Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure Control Plan\" and in Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories \" which is located on the Centers for Disease Control Website : https://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/index.htm All employees handling these materials must take BBP training sessions annu ally on the PEAK site. . Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 175 | P a g e F. DISPOSAL PRACTICES In order to standardize practices of disposal within the Medical Center, the information contained in the Infection Control Manual Sec I -6.1 (Reviewed 12 / 08) is directly incorporated here. a. Discard in \"Regulated Waste -Liquid Waste\" Containers (with sliding lid) lined with red plastic bags : 1. All of the following body fluids in quantities equal to or greater than 20 cc: Blood Pleural f luid Amniotic fluid Any bloody body fluid Pericardial fluid Cerebrospinal fluid Semen Peritoneal fluid Vaginal secretions Containers must be tightly stoppered. Note this does not include urine or stools unless visibly bloody (see below). Note : all rigid containers (i.e. pleurovacs, hemovacs) regardless o f fluid amount (even if under 20 cc) are to be disposed of in Regulated Waste -Liquid Waste Containers. 2. All blood bags and blood tubing. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 176 | P a g e 3. Items dripping with blood except for tampons and sanitary napkins. 4. All waste generated from patients in the process of undergoing peritoneal hemodialysis. b. Discard in \"Regulated Waste -(Non) Liquid Waste\" Containers with closing lid lined with red plastic: 1. Drained urinary bags / tubing / urinary catheters that have remnants of blood but with less than 20 cc visible blood. 2. All waste resulting from the care and treatment of patients with \"highly communicable\" diseases: Marburg, Lassa, Ebola, and similar viruses (for additional information contact Infection Control). 3. Dressings with saturated or dried body flu ids i.e. gauze and chux. c. Discard all used and unused sharps into the Steri -Cycle Reuseable Containers: Sharps that have been used (or opened and not used) in human patient or animal care or in medical or research laboratories. These items include: needles, syringes, scalpel blades, lancets, Pasteur pipettes, blood vials, test tubes, slides, cover slips, and broken or unbroken glassware and other sharps. NOTE: after use, needles should not be recapped, bent, clipped, or broken by hand. d. The following are considered non -regulated waste and may be disposed of in clear bag trash: 1. Drained urinary bags / tubing / urinary catheters (without visible blood). 2. IV tubing and / or bags without visible blood. 3. Any material with drops of blood. 4. Glucose meter strips. 5. Sanitary napkins or tampons. Special note: although many of the procedures mentioned abov e are more commonly associated with patient -related activities, in many cases similar activities are encountered in performing animal research. Articles that are contaminated with blood and body fluids can be indistinguishable from human -source material. Therefore disposal practices should be consistent whether the source is human or not; the regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over waste will not inquire as to the source of the material if an infraction has occurred. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 177 | P a g e e. The color of bags used for disp osal of waste has been standardized: 1. Red bags are to be used for disposal of all potentially infectious waste regulated medical waste which requires off-site incineration with the exception of liquid waste as explained earlier. a. Solids: Are placed into red bags for disposal by the MSMC Waste Management personnel. Red Bags are to remain in the laboratory until picked -up by Waste Management. Storage in hallways, elevator alcoves and stair landings is prohibited. b. Liquids: May be disposed of by toilets or sanitary waste lines, after autoclaving or treatment with a suitable disinfectant . Chemicals may not be disposed of in this manner. 2. White * bags are to be used for autoclaving potentially infectious waste/regulated medical waste. 3. Clear bags are to be used for all other waste. G . BIOHAZARD WASTE STREAM: Compared to domestic waste, chemical waste, t his stream poses the hazard to all Mount Sinai employees of infection with a pathogenic agent that is either directly associated with research activities, or may be coincidentally associated with the materials in use. Special procedures must be employed to ensure that there will be no exposure to the pathogens once the material is offere d for disposal. Both \"Universal Precautions\" materials (all human blood, body fluids, and tissues) and materials known to contain infectious agents, must be autoclaved, or treated in such a way that the material is rendered virtually non -infectious. Autoclaving is the preferred method. If autoclaving is not practical, a chemical disinfectant can be used. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 178 | P a g e Chapter VI of this booklet has a section summarizing the various disinfectants, their use and limitations. For \"Universal Precautions\" materials and materials containing known infectious agents, many of the commercial disinfectants that have been proven to be tuberculocidal, and / or effective against Hepatitis B, polio virus types I, II, III, Pseudomonas aerugi nosa or other bacteria or viruses using the U.S. EPA test protocols, are acceptable for surface decontamination of empty containers and work surfaces. Household bleach is acceptable for decontamination provided that daily , fresh preparations are made and used. After the material has been rendered non - infectious, disposal is effected depending on the physical form of the material, as noted below. All Liquids that have been autoclaved or treated with a chemical disinfectant can be flushed down a toilet or sink with copious amounts of water afterward. All pathological and anatomical human tissues and animal tissues and carcasses are interred or incinerated off -site. If the specimens are derived from ANIMAL sources, arrangements to dispose of anim al tissues and carcasses must be made individually with the Department of Veterinary Sciences, ext. 46683. If the specimens are derived from HUMAN sources, contact the BioSafety Officer at ext. 45169 to arrange for disposal. H. Conclusion: All waste should be disposed of according to the procedures described in detail above . When known infectious agents or chemical reagents which are of moderate -to-high acute toxicity, moderate -to-high chronic toxicity, or known carcinogens are used, OSHA regulations 29 CFR 1910.1030 and .1450 require the development of written standard operating procedures which include waste disposal. SOP's must be available to all staff, or in a central location in the laboratory. Conta ct the Bio Safety Officer to assist in the development of SOP's when necessary or if you have any questions regarding waste disposal procedures at extension 241-5169 .

Introduction Etiologic agents are those microorganisms and microbial toxins that cause disease in humans and include bacteria, bacterial toxins, viruses, fungi, rickettsiae, protozoans, and parasites. These disease - causing microorganisms may also be referred to as infectious agents. Arthropods and other organisms that transmit pathogens to animals (including humans) are called vectors. Etiologic agents, vectors, and materials containing etiologic agents are recognized as hazardous materials. Materials containing etiologic agents are regularly transported from one location to another by common land and air carriers. Materials containing etiologic agents must be appropriately packaged to prevent breakage o r leakage in order to avoid exposure of the package handlers, transporters, and the general public to the package contents. Materials containing etiologic agents must be packaged, labeled, and transported in accordance with all applicable regulations. Mate rial containing etiologic agents being imported into the United States must be accompanied by a U.S. Public Health Service importation permit. B.

International Shipments / WHO Guidelines : http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/254788/WHO -WHE -CPI-2017.8 - eng.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y The international regulations f or the transport of infectious substances by any mode of transport are based upon the Recommendations made by the Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (UNCETDG), a committee of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. The Recommendations are presented in the form of Model Regulations. The United Nations Model Regulations are reflected in international law through international modal agreements (links to further information are provided in Annex 1 ; in the PDF Text ): Air The Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air published by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) are the legally binding international regulations. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) publishes Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) that incorporate the ICAO provisions and may add further restrictions (where necessary such restrictions are included in these guidelines). The ICAO rules apply on all international flights. For national flights, i.e. flig hts within one country, national civil Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 185 | P a g e aviation authorities apply national legislation. This is normally based on the ICAO provisions, but may incorporate variations. State and operator variations are published in the ICAO Technical Instructions and in the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations. Rail Regulations concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Rail (RID) apply to countries in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. RID also applies to domestic transport in the European Union throu gh Council Directive 2008/68/EC. Road The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR) applies to 46 countries. In addition, modified versions of the convention are being used by countries in South America and South -East Asia. ADR also applies to domestic transport in the European Union through Council Directive 2008/68/EC.

Introduction: The NIH Guidelines April 2016 (also \"Guidelines \") Icahn School of Medicine is a recipient of grant funding from the National Institutes of Health. As a recipient contractor, ALL research whether funded directly by the NIH, or by other granting sources, falls under the NIH Guidelines , which is the short version for: NIH Guid elines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (NIH Guidelines) . All Principal Investigators involved with rDNA and related genetic work should become familiar with the Guidelines and its requirements. NIH has a FAQ base at: https://osp.od.nih.gov/biotechnology/nih -guidelines -faqs/ The Guidelines sets out the roles and responsibilities of the NIH, RAC, OBA, ISMMS and the Principal Investigators conducti ng research with recombinant DNA, Gene Therapy / Transfer, or products derived from genetic recombination in Sections I - IV. B. Overview of NIH Guidelines Sections and Appendices Sections I - IV are provided below. Section II discusses conducting a risk asse ssment based on content in Sections I and II . Section III specifically gives the range of experiments covered by the Guidelines and conditions for filing projects with OBA, RAC (Major Actions, Gene Therapy); OBA and ISMMS IBC before initiating work; and r eporting to the ISMMS IBC before or simultaneously with the initiation of the project; and finally those projects EXEMPT from reporting to either OBA or the ISMMS. Several Flow charts are included at the end of this chapter to use in determining where your experiments reside in the Section III requirements. Section IV outlines the responsibilities of the Principal Investigator to ISM -MS, to the ISM -MS Biosafety Committee and to the NIH - OSP, as an awardee / contractor. It is strongly recommended that a PI read and become thoroughly familiar with Sections III and IV, e specially if NIH -OSP is planning on conducting a site visit.

FOOTNOTES AND REFERENCES OF SECTIONS I THROUGH IV Appendix B https://osp.od.nih.gov/wp -content/uploads/NIH_Guidelines.html#_Toc446948379 Subsequent sections of the Guidelines cover Biosafety as related to Recombinant DNA and related topics. All italicized content is directly from the Guidelines . Although there is much overlap with the CDC's Biosafety levels, in some respects the Biosafety Levels in Appendix G are more strict in the Guidelines , in that the NIH is concerned with the inadvertent release of a genetically modified agent to the natural environment. The two appendices given below are used in determining the risk posed by working with a GMMO, and the required protection such work requires. APPENDIX G. PHYSICAL CONTAINMENT contains the requirements for BSLs 1 -4. The objective of physical containment is to confine organisms containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules and to reduce the potential for exposure of the la boratory worker, persons outside of the laboratory, and the environment to organisms containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules. Physical containment is achieved through the use of laboratory practices, containment equipment, and special la boratory design. Emphasis is placed on primary means of physical containment which are provided by laboratory practices and containment equipment. Special laboratory design provides a secondary means of protection against the accidental release of organism s outside the laboratory or to the environment. Special laboratory design is used primarily in facilities in which experiments of moderate to high potential hazard are performed. APPENDIX Q. PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL CONTAINMENT FOR RECOMBINANT OR SYNTHETIC NUCLEIC ACID MOLECULE RESEARCH INVOLVING ANIMALS Appendix Q specifies containment and confinement practices for research involving whole animals, both those in which the animal's genome has been altered by stable introduction of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, or DNA derived therefrom, into the germ -line (transgenic animals) and experiments involving viable recombinant or synthetic nucleic aci d molecule -modified microorganisms Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 196 | P a g e tested on whole animals. The appendix applies to animal research activities with the following modifications: Appendix Q shall supersede Appendix G (Physical Containment ) when research animals are of a size or have growth requirements that preclude the use of containment for laboratory animals. Some animals may require other types of containment (see Appendix Q -III-D, Footnotes and References for Appendix Q). The animals covered in Appendix Q are those species normally categorized as animals including but not lim ited to cattle, swine, sheep, goats, horses, and poultry. Appendix Q contains the requirements for BSLs 1 -4 relating to animal research (ABSL's in the BMBL). The CDC levels were given earlier in this manual. Other Appendices of the Guidelines are: APPENDIX B. CLASSIFICATION OF HUMAN ETIOLOGIC AGENTS ON THE BASIS OF HAZARD This appendix includes those biological agents known to infect humans as well as sel ected animal agents that may pose theoretical risks if inoculated into humans. Included are lists of representative genera and species known to be pathogenic; mutated, recombined, and non -pathogenic species and strains are not considered. Non -infectious li fe cycle stages of parasites are excluded. This appendix reflects the current state of knowledge and should be considered a resource document. Included are the more commonly encountered agents and is not meant to be all -inclusive. Information on agent risk assessment may be found in the Agent Summary Statements of the CDC/NIH publication, Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (see Sections V -C, V-D, V-E, and V -F, Footnotes and References of Sections I through IV . Further guidance on agents not listed in Appendix B may be obtained through: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Biosafety Branch, Atlanta, Georgia 30333, Phone: (404) 639 -3883, Fax: (404) 639 -2294; National Institutes of Health, Division of Safety, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, Phone: (301) 496 -1357; National Animal Disea se Center, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Ames, Iowa 50010, Phone: (515) 862 -8258. A special committee of the American Society for Microbiology will conduct an annual review of this appendix and its recommendation for changes will be presented to the Rec ombinant DNA Advisory Committee as proposed amendments to the NIH Guidelines . A summary table is given below. A very rough rule of thumb is that BSL -1 practices go with RG -1, BSL -2 with RG -2 agents and so on up the scale. An exception is HIV, which require s only BSL -2, yet is a RG3 - agent. Another consideration is that the RGs are based on the risks and hazards presented by the agent, whereas the BSLs address the performance -based safety practices needed to protect researchers and the environment from expos ure. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 197 | P a g e Appendix B - Table 1. Basis for the Classification of Biohazardous Agents by Risk Group (RG) Risk Group 1 (RG1) Agents that are not associated with disease in healthy adult humans Risk Group 2 (RG2) Agents that are associated with human disease which is rarely serious and for which preventive or therapeutic interventions are often available Risk Group 3 (RG3) Agents that are associated with serious or lethal human disease for which preventive or therapeutic interventions may be available (high individual risk but low community risk) Risk Group 4 (RG4) Agents that are likely to cause serious or lethal human disease for which preventive or therapeutic interventions are not usually available (high individual risk and high community risk) APPENDIX C.EXEMPTIONS UNDER SECTION III -F-8 Section III -F-8 states that exempt from these NIH Guidelines are \"those that do not present a significant risk to health or the environment (see Section IV -C-1-b-(1)-(c), NIH Director --Specific Responsibil ities), as determined by the NIH Director, with the advice of the RAC, and following appropriate notice and opportunity for public comment. See Appen dix C , Exemptions under Sections III -F-8, for other classes of experiments which are exempt from the NIH Guidelines .\" The following classes of experiments are exempt under Section III -F-8: Recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules containing less than one -half of any eukaryotic viral genome (all viruses from a single family being considered identical -- see Appendix C -IX-E, Footnotes and References of Appendix C ), that are propagated and maintained in cells in tissue culture are exempt from these NIH Guidelines with the exceptions listed i n Appendix C -I-A. The following categories are not exempt from the NIH Guidelines : (i) experiments described in Section III - B which require NIH/OBA and Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation, (ii) experiments involving DNA from Risk Groups 3, 4, or restricted organism s (see Appendix B , Classification of Human Etiologic Agents on the Basis of Hazard , and Sections V -G and V -L, Footnotes and References of Sections I through IV ) or cells known to be infected with these agents, (iii) experiments involving the deliberate introduction of genes coding for the biosyn thesis of molecules that are toxic for vertebrates (see Appendix F , Containment Conditions for Cloning of Genes Coding for the Biosynthesis of Molec ules Toxic for Vertebrates ), and (iv) whole plants regenerated from plant cells and tissue cultures are covered Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 198 | P a g e by the exemption provided they remain axenic cultures even though they differentiate into embryonic tissue and regenerate into plantlets. APPENDIX D. MAJOR ACTIONS TAKEN UNDER THE NIH GUIDELINES As noted in the subsections of Section IV -C-1-b-(1), the Director, NIH, may take certain actions with regard to the NIH Guidelines after the issues have been considered by the R AC. Some of the actions taken to date include the following: Appendix D /6 2010 ) This is a compendium of preceding determinations made by RAC and OBA regarding vectors and gene therapy transfers. This Appendix can infor m PIs and research Coordinators of past filings with OBA and RAC, and the need to file their projects as Ma jor Actions. APPENDIX E. CERTIFIED HOST -VECTOR SYSTE MS (See Appendix I, Biological Containment) While many experiments using Escherichia coliK-12, Saccharomyces cerevisiae , and Bacillus subtilis are currently exempt from the NIH Guidelines under Section III -F, Exempt Experiments , some derivatives of these host -vector systems were previously classified as Host -Vector 1 Systems or Host -Vector 2 Sy stems. A listing of those systems is presented in Appendix E. Biological containment is a unique concept in the Guidelines, since it relies on the host's biological properties to restrict or prevent the release of a GMMO to the environment. APPENDIX F. CONTAINMENT CONDITIONS FOR CLONING OF GENES CODING FOR THE BIOSYNTHESIS OF MOLECULES TOXIC FOR VERTEBRATES Appendix F specifies the containment to be used for the deliberate cloning of genes coding for the biosynthesis of molecules toxic for vertebrates. The cloning of genes coding for molecules toxic for vertebrates that have an LD 50 of < 100 nanograms per kilograms body weight (e.g., microbial toxi ns such as the botulinum toxins, tetanus toxin, diphtheria toxin, Shigella dysenteriae neurotoxin) are covered under Section III -B-1 APPENDIX H. PATHOGENIC AGENT SHIPMENT S In addition to DOT / IATA Class 6.2 Regulations, The Guidelines regulate shipments of GMOs and GMMOs in domestic and Internationa l Shipments. Host organisms and viruses will be shipped as etiologic agents if they contain recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules when: (i) the recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule includes the complete genome of a host organism or viru s regulated as a human or animal pathogen or a plant pest; or (ii) the recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule codes for a toxin or other factor directly involved in eliciting human, animal, or plant disease or inhibiting plant growth, and is carrie d on an expression vector or within the host chromosome Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 199 | P a g e and/or when the host organism contains a conjugation proficient plasmid or a generalized transducing phage; or (iii) the recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule comes from a host organism or vi rus regulated as a human or animal pathogen or as a plant pest and has not been adequately characterized to demonstrate that it does not code for a factor involved in eliciting human, animal, or plant disease. APPENDIX I. BIOLOGICAL CONTAINMENT (See Appendix E, Certified Host -Vector Systems ) In consideration of biological containment, the vector (plasmid, organelle, or virus) for the recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule and the host (bacterial, plant, or animal cell) in which the vector is propagated in the laboratory will be considered together. Any combination of vector and host which is to provide biological containment shall be chosen or construc ted so that the following types of \"escape\" are minimized: (i) survival of the vector in its host outside the laboratory, and (ii) transmission of the vector from the propagation host to other non -laboratory hosts. The following levels of biological contai nment (host -vector systems) for prokaryotes are established. Appendices I -I-A through I -II-B describe levels of biological containment (host -vector systems) for prokaryotes. Specific criteria will depend on the organisms to be used. APPENDIX J. BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH SUBCOMMITTEE The National Science and Technology Council's Committee on Fundamental Science determined that a subcommittee should be continued to identify and coordinate Federal research efforts, identify research needs, stimulating international cooperation, and assess national and international policy issues concerning biotechnology sciences. The primary emphasis will be on scientific issues to i ncrease the overall effectiveness and productivity of the Federal investment in biotechnology sciences, especially regarding issues which cut across agency boundaries. This subcommittee is called the Biotechnology Research Subcommittee. APPENDIX K. PHYSICAL CONTAINMENT FOR LARGE SCALE USES OF ORGANISMS CONTAINING RECOMBINANT OR SYNTHETIC NUCLEIC ACID MOLECULES Appendix K specifies physical containment guidelin es for large -scale (greater than 10 liters of culture) research or production involving viable organisms containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules. It shall apply to large -scale research or production activities as specified in Section III -D-6, Experiments Involving More than 10 Liters of Culture . APPENDIX L. GENE THERAPY POLICY CONFERENCES (GTPCS) In order to enhance the depth and value of public discussion relevant to scientific, safety, social, and ethical implications of gene therapy research, the NIH Director will convene GTPCs at regular intervals. Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 200 | P a g e As appropriate, the NIH Director may convene a GTPC in conjunction with a RAC meeting. GTPCs will be administered by NIH/O SP. https://osp.od.nih.gov/biosafety -biosecurity -and-emerging -biotechnology/ APPENDIX M. POINTS TO CONSIDER IN THE DESIGN AND SUBMISSION OF PROTOCOLS FOR THE TRANSFER OF recombinant or synthetic NUCLEIC ACID MOLECULES INTO ONE OR MORE HUMAN RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS (POINTS TO CONSIDER) Appendix M applies to r esearch conducted at or sponsored by an institution that receives any support for recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research from NIH. Researchers not covered by the NIH Guidelines are encouraged to use Appendix M (see Section I -C, General Applicability ). Research proposals involving the deliberate transfer of recombinant or syntheti c nucleic acid molecules, or DNA or RNA derived from such nucleic acid molecules, into human subjects (human gene transfer) will be considered through a review process involving both NIH/OBA and RAC. Investigators shall submit their relevant information on the proposed human gene transfer experiments to NIH/OBA. Submission of human gene transfer protocols to NIH will be in the format described in Appendix M -I-A, Submission Requirements for Protocol Submission . Submission to NIH shall be for registration purposes and will ensure continued public access to relevant human gene transfer information conducted in compliance with the NIH Guidelines . Investigational New Drug (IND) applications should be submitted to FDA in the format described in 21 CFR, Chapter I, Subchapter D, Part 312, Subpart B, Section 23, IND Content and Format . Institutional Biosafety Committee approval must be obtained from each institution at which recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule material will be administered to human subjects (as opposed to each institution involved in the production of vectors for human application and each institution at which there is ex vivo transduction of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule material into targe t cells for human application). This is a very important Appendix, since the requirements for applying for gene therapy projects are contai ned here. There are very important IRB requirements as well as IBC, OBA and RAC requirements, which the Principal Investigator or Research Coordinator MUST be aware of. Failure to file an Appendix M can result in the suspension of a research grant by the N IH until the infraction is resolved to the satisfaction of the NIH. ISMMS researchers must be aware that even though they are funded by an international Pharmaceutical company to conduct a clinical trial, either the parent Pharmaceutical company OR THE ISM MS PI MUS T have a valid Appendix M filed with and approval from NIH OBA before empaneling subjects in the trial. The key point is that all research conducted at ISMMS comes under NIH Guidelines regulation , and Biosafety Manual 4th Edition 9/2018 201 | P a g e international companies may not be aware of th is requirement to submit an Appendix M. The obligation then falls on the ISMMS researcher to submit the appendix. APPENDIX P. PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL CONTAINME NT FOR RECOMBINANT OR SYNTHETIC NUCLEIC ACID MOLECULE RESEARCH INVOLVING PLANTS Appendix P specifies physical and biological containment conditions and practices suitable to the greenhouse conduct of experiments involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic a cid molecule -containing plants, plant -associated microorganisms, and small animals. The principal purpose of plant containment is to avoid the unintentional transmission of a recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule -containing plant genome, including nuclear or organelle hereditary material or release of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule -derived organisms associated with plants. Currently, there is no plant -related research conducted at the ISMMS. C. INSTITUTIONAL BIOSAFETY COMMITTEE (IBC) The Institutional Biosafety Committee is the committee that reviews and approves all experiments that come under the NIH Guidelines, except those that fall under Section III -E which are designated \"Exempt\" from reporting to the IBC. The IBC is still intere sted in Non - exempt research projects and requests that the Biosafety Officer keep records on all exempt DNA activities. The Charter for the Committee that delineates the committee's responsibilities under NIH -OBA and was approved is provided below. MSSM ha s now become ISMMS. 1. The Mount Sinai School of Medicine (MSSM) will maintain an Institutional Biosafety Committee consistent with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines published in Published in Federal Register, July 5, 1994 ( 59 FR 34496 ) and its most recently published amendment. [Currently, November 2013] 2. Membership of the committee will consist of no fewer than 5 individuals with experience and experti se in recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology and other biosafety issues. At least two members shall not be affiliated with the MSSM and should represent the interests of the surrounding community with respect to public health and protection of the environment. At least one member shall have expertise in animal containment principles and one member shall be a Biological Safety Officer 3. The responsibilities of the IBC include, but are not limited to the following: a. Review rDNA, pathogen, oncogene, toxins and toxic chemical use in research conducted at MSSM.
