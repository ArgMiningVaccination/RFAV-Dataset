The answer to this ques3on gives insights about treatment Breast CA Op<ons-2016-MBS 11 Conven<onal View on Causes of Cancer: Soma3c Muta3ons Theory Cancer arises from a stepwise accumula<on of gene<c and epigene<c changes in oncogenes, suppressor genes and DNA repair genes that liberate neoplas<c cells from the homeosta<c mechanisms that govern normal cell prolifera<on Targeted therapies based on looking for overexpressed genes and developing drugs to address them (e.g. Gleevec, Aromatase Inhibitors, Tamoxifen) Largely not successful and very expensive Breast CA Op<ons-2016-MBS 12 Basics of Chromosomes and Genes To understand the current theory about cancer, need to understand a liole about genes and chromosomes Each human cell has 22 pairs of chromosomes, 2 X chromosomes in women and an X and a Y chromosome in men Genes are located on chromosomes and contain the gene<c material inherited from our parents Breast CA Op<ons-2016-MBS 13 Ploidy Ploidy refers to the number of sets of chromosomes in the nucleus of a cell Haploid = 1 set Diploid = 2 sets (What we have) Polyploidy = More than 2 sets Aneuploidy refers to disorganized sets Breast CA Op<ons-2016-MBS 14 Diploidy vs. Aneuploidy: Inside the Nucleus of a Cell Diploidy-NL Aneuploidy-CA Breast CA Op<ons-2016-MBS 15 Chromosomal Chaos & Cancer: Scien<c American May 2007 The nuclei of cancer cells contain en<re chromosomes (which carry thousands of genes) are severely scrambled\u2014duplicated, broken, structurally rearranged or missing en3rely Generally ignored by conven<onal oncology Breast CA Op<ons-2016-MBS 16 DNA and the Double Helix Outlined by James Watson PhD and Francis Crick PhD Breast CA Op<ons-2016-MBS 17 1953-Paper; beat Linus Pauling who was also working on the structure of genes Led to Human Genome Project; all genes worked out by careful research Human Genome Project Sequenced by 2003 Breast CA Op<ons-2016-MBS 18 Believed easy to nd rela<onship between common cancers and gene sequences Total Failure-Much more complex Numerous gene sequences even within one cancer New Book 2014-Traces the History of Cancer and the Various Theories Breast CA Op<ons-2016-MBS 19 Shows how the less than useful theory of the soma<c muta<onal theory of cancer fails to lead to useful treatments Outlines how the metabolic theory of cancer due to mitochondrial damage result in poten<ally useful treatments Some of these treatment discussed Cancer: a Metabolic Mitochondrial Disease-NOT a Nuclear Disease Contrary to prevalent scien<c oncological consensus, cancer is NOT primarily a nuclear gene<c disease or even a nuclear chromosomal disease Cancer is a metabolic disease associated with mitochondrial damage Originally proposed by O@o Warburg MD, PhD and more recently by Thomas Seyfried PhD Breast CA Op<ons-2016-MBS 20 O@o Heinrich Warburg, MD, PhD Breast CA Op<ons-2016-MBS 21 Won Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1931 Described the fundamental dierence between normal cells and cancer cells Cancer cells unable to eec3vely use oxygen to produce energy Cancer cells form as a result of low oxygen environment Book: Cancer as a Metabolic Disease by Thomas Seyfried PhD Breast CA Op<ons-2016-MBS 22 Fundamental Dierence Between Cancer Cells and Normal Cells Energy of most biochemical reac<ons in the body come from ATP molecules Cancer cells produce energy (ATP molecules) by glycolysis or fermenta3on, the metabolism of sugar without using oxygen, even if oxygen is present (Warburg Eect) Normal cells produce energy primarily by using oxygen Breast CA Op<ons-2016-MBS 23 Oxida3ve Metabolism Needs Less Glucose The Krebs cycle and electron transfer in the mitochondria use oxygen to produce between 30 and 38 molecules of ATP from 1 molecule of glucose Anaerobic metabolism or glycolysis produces 2 molecules of ATP from 1 molecule of glucose. Cancer cells primarily use anaerobic metabolism and not oxygen to metabolize glucose So, cancer cells need 15 to 19 3mes more glucose than normal cells to produce the same amount of energy Prac3cal Implica3on: Excessive sugar drives cancer growth 24 Breast CA Op<ons-2016-MBS ATP Produc<on in a Normal Cell vs. a Cancer Cell 38 ATP Molecules 2 to 4 ATPs Breast CA Op<ons-2016-MBS 25 Normal Cell Cancer Cell 26 PET Scans Make Use of the \"Warburg Eect\" to Find Cancers (Posi3ve Emission Tomography) A PET scan, unlike a normal X-ray, can detect cancer before organ or gland enlargement occurs by using fluorescent tagged glucose. Here a normal X-ray of the chest (lek) is compared with a PET scan of the chest producing normal results (top right) and a PET scan revealing cancer that's spread to the lymph nodes (black areas in booom right. Radioac3ve sugar accumulates in cancer cells and these can be seen on a PET Scan Breast CA Op<ons-2016-MBS Cancer Cells Develop in a Low Oxygen Environment-Essen3al to Warburg Hypothesis Cancer cells develop as an adapta3on to a low oxygen environment They cannot use oxygen because of damage to mitochondria This adapta<on develops over a long period of <me and become irreversible and cancer cells cannot use oxygen, even when it is present (the Warburg Eect) This view that cancer is due to mitochondrial damage is expressed by Thomas Seyfried PhD Breast CA Op<ons-2016-MBS 27 Brian Peskin and \"The Hidden Story of Cancer\" Breast CA Op<ons-2016-MBS 28 Brian Peskin Scholarly book explaining the Ooo Warburg theory of cancer and how faoy acids in cell membranes are involved Well referenced; cri<cal of status quo Cancer is s3mulated by a low oxygen cellular environment Peskin hypothesizes how this happens What Contributes to a Low Cellular Oxygen Environment that Leads to CA Peskin presents evidence that abnormali3es in the fa@y acids in membranes of cells reduces oxygen to cells Peskin points out that 95% of parent essen3al Acid-Omega 6 and Linolenic Acid-Omega 3] wind up in the cell membranes of cells Only 5% is used for deriva<ves that produce prostaglandins (GLA, EPA, DHA) The double bonds of these parent faoy acids within the cell membrane a@ract oxygen into cells Breast CA Op<ons-2016-MBS 29 Adulterated Fa@y Acids Increase Shelf Life and Distort Cell Membranes In order to increase shelf life, food processing companies, change the structure of the faoy acids in the food (trans FA are one example) These \"adulterated fa@y acids\" are incorporated into the cell membranes throughout the body If adulterated fa@y acids replace parent essen3al fa@y acids, oxygen content of cells can be reduced by 50% (cancer forms over <me with 33% oxygen reduc<ons, according to Warburg) Breast CA Op<ons-2016-MBS 30 Fish Oil Supplements Not Recommended Fish Oil Capsules and liquid are unphysiologic and not recommended (one capsule equals several sh meals) These longer faoy acids are incorporated into the cell membrane and distort it, worsening func<on Reported benets are generally short-lived and are analogous to an3-inflammatory eect of using steroids Both conven<onal and alterna<ve prac<<oners prescribe lots of sh oil Breast CA Op<ons-2016-MBS 31 Ques3ons a Pa3ent or Support Person Should Ask Before Making CA Treatment Decision Likelihood survival <me will be increased Likelihood quality of life will be improved Risks associated with the treatment: -Morbidity -Mortality -Secondary cancers 32 Breast CA Op<ons-2016-MBS Why Are the Results of Conven<onal Treatment for Stage IV Cancers So Poor? CANCER STEM CELLS MAY BE ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS!! Breast CA Op<ons-2016-MBS 33 Normal Stem Cells Repair Damaged Tissue Breast CA Op<ons-2016-MBS 34 Origin of Normal Stem Cells During embryological development of the fetus, 80% of the precursors to the ova or spermatozoa become ova in women and spermatozoa in me The rest of these pluripotent cells (20% of them) are scaoered throughout the body and become the stem cells, which are later used for repair This theory was rst elaborated by embryologist John Beard MD, PhD in his trophoblas<c theory of cancer in 1911. For more about this theory, see the book by the late Nicholas Gonzalez MD: \"The Trophoblast and the Origins of Cancer\" (2010).
