Vaccines are not yet a major type of treatment for cancer, although there is research into a type of vaccine called a dendritic cell vaccine. DC Vax\u00ae-L is a dendritic cell vaccine which has been used in a clinical trial for [glioblastoma](https://www.thebraintumourcharity.org/brain-tumour-diagnosis-treatment/types-of-brain-tumour-adult/glioblastoma/), read about the [early findings from the trial](https://www.thebraintumourcharity.org/media-centre/news/research-news/early-findings-phase-3-clinical-trial-report-prom/). Several vaccines for [DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma)](https://www.thebraintumourcharity.org/brain-tumour-diagnosis-treatment/types-brain-tumour-children/dipg-diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/) are being/have been tested in [clinical trials](https://www.thebraintumourcharity.org/brain-tumour-diagnosis-treatment/treating-brain-tumours/clinical-trials/).

Vaccines to prevent diseases like measles or chickenpox are commonplace. Scientists are now using similar principles to develop vaccines to prevent, and sometimes treat, cancer. The changes that lead to a cancerous cell vary from person to person, so finding a vaccine that works in a population of people with one type of cancer is still challenging. Clinical trials for vaccines for other cancer types are ongoing. Vaccines to prevent diseases like measles or chicken pox are commonplace. Scientists are now using similar principles to develop vaccines to prevent, and sometimes treat, cancer. Clinical trials for vaccines for other cancer types are ongoing. Dendritic cell vaccines Dendritic cell vaccines have shown the most success so far in treating cancer. What are Dendritic cells? Dendritic cells are special immune cells in the body that help the immune system recognise foreign cells, such as tumour cells. They break down foreign cells into small pieces to reveal the foreign substances (antigens) it contains. Dendritic cells then hold out these antigens, so other immune cells called T-cells can see them. The T-cells then start an immune reaction against any cells in the body that contain these antigens. How Dendritic cell vaccines are made Dendritic cell vaccines are made from the dendritic cells of the person that the vaccine will be used in. The process is complex and expensive. Doctors remove some immune cells from the patient's blood and expose them in the lab to tumour cells or tumour antigens. The dendritic cells are 'taught' to recognise the tumour antigen and identify it as unwanted in the body. These 'educated' dendritic cells are injected back into the patient, where they recognise and target tumour cells with that particular antigen on their surface. They then recruit other immune cells in our body and trigger an immune response to kill the tumour cells. DC Vax\u00ae-L [DC Vax\u00ae-L](/brain-tumour-diagnosis-treatment/treating-brain-tumours/emerging-treatments/immunotherapy/dc-vax-l/) is an example of a dendritic cell vaccine. DC Vax\u00ae-L differs from other immunotherapies that train T-cells to attack cancer cells (such as CAR-T cell therapy listed below), in that most of these immunotherapies attack a single target on the cancer cells - DC Vax\u00ae-L uses different types of immune cells, mainly dendritic cells, to recognise different targets. It also mobilises signalling molecules with the aim of involving the whole immune system. DC Vax\u00ae-L has been used in a clinical trial for [glioblastoma](/brain-tumour-diagnosis-treatment/types-of-brain-tumour-adult/glioblastoma/), read about the [early findings from the trial](/media-centre/news/research-news/early-findings-phase-3-clinical-trial-report-prom/). Other vaccines Several vaccines for [DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma)](/brain-tumour-diagnosis-treatment/types-brain-tumour-children/dipg-diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/) are being/have been 'EGFRvIII peptide vaccine' and a 'B7-H3 vaccine'. These have tended to be early stage Phase 1 trials that test for safety, so more research needs to be done.
