Vaccines are made from either monkey, calf or chicken cultures in order to inject of weakened or live viruses directly into the body. Many still contain thimerosal, a mercury compound used as a preservative. The viruses then infect cells by injecting their DNA or RNA into our cell's DNA. This is a form of genetic mutation, in which the virus re-writes the cell's master instructions to do something else, like produce more viruses. However, this can go horribly wrong and do something else entirely. The medical field has recently learned that viruses are the cause of some cancers, such as the case of HPV in cervical cancer. This begs the question \"Are we trading mumps and measles for cancer and leukemia?\". Proponents of vaccinations will always point to the research showing no evidence of such. However, having no evidence does not mean vaccines are safe. In fact, many scientists categorically state that there have never been any double-blind, placebo-controlled (gold standard) research studies done that measure effectiveness nor chronic side effects of their use. I, myself, have yet to see any (if you have, please send them to me). We are now seeing vaccines coming to market faster and faster solely based on the premise that vaccines are \"Safe\". The swine flu vaccine has barely had year of testing, the norm used to be at least 7 years. Unfortunately the media has reported that a 14 year old girl died in Britain shortly after receiving the HPV vaccine, that came out a few years ago. They are also many other suspected side effects such as Gillain Bare Syndrome, Autism, ADD, Alzheimer's and other neurological damages. As an aside note, I recently came across a couple of interesting statistic from \"International Mortality Statistics, 1981\". It showed that between 1915 and 1958, the death rate of measles declined by 98%, despite the vaccine being introduced some 5 years later! Between 1923 and 1953 the Polio death rate had declined by 50% and continuing on a downward trend, again before the vaccine was introduced. So why the big decline? It just so happened to be when hygienic practices such as washing your hands became the norm. Dr. Derek Cook "}
