March 27, 2019 2 min read To have the best health and strongest immune system, it's important to assist the natural cleansing cycles of your body. With an Ayurvedic cleanse, you do this by taking supportive minerals and herbs that amplify this natural process each night. The other aspect of an Ayurvedic cleanse is that you only consume foods that are pure, whole and digestible. The constant consumption of processed foods, unnatural sugars and worse make it difficult for the body to eliminate the toxins that are already present from the enviroment. There are countless trendy cleanses that you've likely heard of or tried yourself, but we think a gradual medicinal path is the best for a myriad of reasons. An Ayurvedic cleanse is based on panchakarma practices that date back to more than 3000 years ago. Panchakarma means five therapies. This form of cleansing gently detoxify the body in a natural, sustainable way. The main components of the cleanse: A kitchari diet and fermented foods Hot water or herbal tea throughout the day Detox Veda at night Ayurvedic cleanses can begin to boost your metabolism. When you eat easily digestible foods, as they are in kitchari, you gently feed your body's digestive fire. This, over time, speeds the metabolism. Spices like cumin, coriander, clove, fennel, black pepper and ginger help in supporting a well-balanced metabolism and gut. Our [Detox Veda](/product/detoxveda/) elixir contains over 122 ingredients, including MSM, [shilajit](https://nariveda.com/shilajit-benefits/), the amino acid L-Glutathione, called the \"master antioxidant\", and I-Sabi, which provides a full spectrum of ITCs (icothioscyanates) that support the immune system and detoxifies the liver. This elixir provides you with an amplified detoxification therapy and should be taken at night after dinner to support the natural timing of the body's natural detoxification. Th cleansing process also removes fat-soluble toxins. The ghee in the kitchari during this cleanse supports the healthy fortification of good minerals while the body eliminates waste and toxins.
