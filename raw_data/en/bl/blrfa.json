Introduction Euphorbia hirta is frequently known as \"Asthma plant\" in English and \"Dudhi\" in Hindi. The plant is widely distributed throughout the globe, and in Asia, it is mainly found in Yemen, Oman, Palestine, Taiwan, Syria, Lebanon, India, Bhutan, Pakistan, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea and the Philippines [1](#R135578324434582). The plant belongs to the genus Euphorbia family of Euphorbiaceae. The morphological features of E. hirta include a slender stem with hair development and many branches arising from it from base to top. The plant is annual purple or reddish in color and attains a height of approximately 40 cm. The leaves of the plant grow oppositely and are elliptical-oblong to oblong-lanceolate in shape. The leaves measure up to 1 - 2.5 cm in length with green color on the top side and pale color on the bottom side. The fruits are three-celled, yellow, keeled capsules, hairy, 1 - 2 mm in diameter, containing four-sided, three brown, wrinkled, angular, seeds [2](#R135578324434583), [3](#R135578324434584), [4](#R135578324434585), [5](#R135578324434586). The plant Euphorbia hirta has long served humanity in the form of traditional and folk medicine. In addition to Euphorbia hirta, other species of the genus Euphorbia also show medicinal importance and are being used in traditional medicine. A milky juice comes out of all the species of Euphorbia upon breaking, and this juice is considered to be more/less toxic and hence was used on arrows for hunting purposes in old times [6](#R135578324434587). Euphorbia hirta is a the plant has been found to have significant anticancer effects against a variety of aggressive cancer cells. This review aims to summarize the phytochemical compositions and pharmacological activities of Euphorbia hirta and tries to bridge the possible role of Euphorbia hirta in the management of COVID-19, a going on global pandemic. Respiratory tract exposure to the external environment leads to high communicability of the disease. SARS-CoV-2 patients differ in clinical symptoms some show evident symptoms, and some remain asymptotic [7](#R135578324434588). Asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 viral loads are the most active transporters leading to the fast spread of the disease because these patients are not aware of the disease until advanced stages. The initial clinical symptoms involve chills, fever, fatigue, cough, diarrhea, shortness of breath and respiratory symptoms. The generation of potential vaccines or capable drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection is the global emergency right now. Unfortunately, the development of vaccines or potential drugs may take a longer time. Therefore, intermediate treatment methodologies are needed to address this global health issue. The government of the Republic of China is currently emphasizing Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection [8](#R135578324434589), [9](#R135578324434590). Several clinical trials have already been initiated to study the efficiency of TCM against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In certain cases, patients along with Western medicine were sidewise supplied with TCM. The results showed that TCM induced synergistic effects with Western medicine against SARS-CoV-2 [10](#R135578324434591). Treatments with medicinal plants and herbs are mostly symptoms and sign based. Herbal medicines with potential efficacy against specified targets against viruses could be evaluated for their activity against SARS-CoV-2, reliant on signs and symptoms [11](#R135578324434592), [12](#R135578324434593). The prime focus of this review was to summarize the phytochemical constituents and pharmacological and medicinal importance of Euphorbia hirta along with assessing its possibility to be used COVID-19. Euphorbia hirta E. hirta Linn.

Aerial parts leucocyanidol, euphorbianin and euphorbins A-E have isolated from the plant. Medicinal property of Euphorbia hirta Different parts of E. hirta have shown numerous pharmacological and biological properties. The high biological value of the plant is primarily attributed to its high diversity in phytochemical content. Some of the biological activities are represented in [Figure 4](#f-8fec37c22369). Ethnopharmacology E. hirta has a very high medicinal value. Ethnopharmacologically, E. hirta is used to cure respiratory and bronchial disorders (hay fever, bronchitis and asthma), conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal diseases such as intestinal parasitosis, dysentery and diarrhea. Furthermore, E. hirta shows significant tonic and hypotensive properties [26](#R135578324434607). Stem sap of E. hirta is used to cure eyelid styes caused by bacterial infection, and leaves are used against boils and swellings by making their poultice. The plant as a whole is used by humans against different diseases, such as fresh herb decoction in the treatment of thrush by gargling, dry decoction to cure skin disorders and decoction of roots, which is implemented in snake bites and for milk production in nursing mothers [27](#R135578324434608). Antispasmodic and antiamoebic activities have been shown for polyphenolic extracts of the plant [28](#R135578324434609), [29](#R135578324434610). Furthermore, the E. hirta-isolated compound quercitrin has been reported to have remarkable antidiarrheal potential [30](#R135578324434611), [31](#R135578324434612). It shows reflexive effects on cardiovascular systems in humans, such as the respiratory system [32](#R135578324434613). The E. hirta plant alcoholic extracts show tranquilizing effects on the genitor-urinary tract and report hypoglycemic effects in rats [33](#R135578324434614), [34](#R135578324434615). The isolated compounds and solvent extracts of E. hirta demonstrated substantial anticancer activities. E. hirta extracts exhibit inhibitory effects on prostaglandin release, including D2, E2 and I2. It has also been reported to produce protective effects against contamination caused by aflatoxin in mustard, rice, maize and wheat crops [35](#R135578324434616). Methanolic extracts of E. hirta leaves have been shown to have strong antibacterial and antifungal properties. Itchy soles are treated by pounding, warming and rubbing the leaves of E. hirta with coconut oil and turmeric. Plant latex is used to cure eye sores by applying it to the surma on the lower eyelids. A number of the ethnopharmacological uses of E. of on the discharge of IL-6 and TNF- in anti-DNP-HAS activated rat peritoneal mast cells.| |2||Antibacterial activity||Different solvent extracts from E. hirta were evaluated for antibacterial effects Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus , and Escherichia coli .

The extract showed strong inhibition of all these bacteria except Salmonella typhi. The minimum inhibitory values were calculated to be 74.61, 22.55 and 54.09 mg/ml for Bacillus aureus and Escherichia coli, respectively [36](#R135578324434617). Unlike solvent extractions from the stem, bud and leaves of E. hirta, their antimicrobial effects against Staphylococcus aureus were evaluated using the disc-diffusion method. The methanolic extract from leaves and bud exhibited very strong activity against S. aureus, with a zone of inhibition score of 20 mm and a zone of inhibition area score of 471.00 mm2 [37](#R135578324434618). Chloroform and aqueous fractions of E. hirta L. leaves have been reported to possess noncytotoxic but antibacterial effects against Klebsiella pneumonia [38](#R135578324434619). Anti-inflammatory activity The medicinal herb E. hirta has been reported to have remarkable anti-inflammatory effects. In a study, the aqueous and ethanolic extracts of E. hirta were evaluated for their anti-inflammatory activity against carrageenan-induced inflammation in rats. It has been shown that both extracts produced substantial anti-inflammatory effects against the reference drug diclofenac sodium (50 mg/kg) [39](#R135578324434620). In a similar study, the lyophilized aqueous extract from E. hirta has been reported to suppress inflammation in carrageenan-induced rats starting from the concentrations of 100 mg/kg of body weight [40](#R135578324434621). Furthermore, n-hexane extracts from E. hirta have been shown to inhibit inflammation in mouse models of phorbol acetate-induced ear inflammation [41](#R135578324434622). The anti-inflammatory effects were found be concentration-dependent. In another study, fractionated Euphorbia hirta aqueous extract fibroblasts [42](#R135578324434623). Antioxidant activity E. hirta possesses strong antioxidant activities in both animal models and in vitro. It has been shown to have strong free radical scavenging potency in various experimental models using DPPH assays. The of the methanolic extract of E. hirta was investigated. The results reported that the methanolic fraction of E. hirta leaf extract produced a tremendous DPPH inhibition of 71.96\u00b10.78%. The increasing order of DPPH scavenging activity of E. hirta was stems (44.42\u00b10.94%) < roots (48.59\u00b10.97%) < flowers (52.45\u00b10.66%) < leaves. The IC50 values calculated for stems, roots, flowers and leaves were 1.358, 0.989, 0.972 and 0.803 mg/mL, respectively [43](#R135578324434624). Another study carried out by S. Asha and coworkers reported significant antioxidant activity for E. hirta. They showed antioxidant activities for three types of extractions from E. hirta through superoxide, DPPH and hydroxyl extracts (ethanolic, methanolic and aqueous), the ethanolic extract exhibited the highest antioxidant propensity with a significant IC50 value compared to the methanolic and aqueous extracts. Furthermore, a significant relationship was obtained between the phenolic content of the extracts and antioxidant activity, and the ethanolic extract showed a high phenolic content [44](#R135578324434625). E. hirta showed maximum free radical scavenging and antioxidant activities at approximately 0.25 mg/ml. Anticancer activity Several traditionally used medicinal plants are thought to have preventive effects against different human malignancies, including cancer. These plants are rich in chemical contents that show modulatory effects on different physiological functions and target the proliferation of cancer cells. E. hirta has been reported to produce significant anticancer effects in vitro against acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells [45](#R135578324434626). Furthermore, extracts from E. hirta have revealed anticancer effects against squamous cell carcinoma, Hep-2 and malignant melanoma [46](#R135578324434627), [47](#R135578324434628). Shao-Ming Chi et al., isolated a cyclopentanone derivative from Euphorbia hirta. The ethanolic extract was examined for cytotoxicity against the K562 and A549 cell lines. The outcome of the study revealed weak cytotoxicity against A549 cells (15.02 \u00b1 11.60%) and remained almost inactive against K562 cells [48](#R135578324434629). Sandeep et al. in 2011 evaluated the antitumor properties of E. hirta [49](#R135578324434630). Aerial parts of E. hirta were extracted using different solvents, including chloroform, ethanol and petroleum ether, and showed positive results for the presence of alkaloids, tannins, saponins, and flavonoids. The ethanol and chloroform extracts were reported to maximize the mean survival and inhibit the growth of solid tumors in administered mice. This antitumor activity was attributed to the manifestation of flavonoids. Antimalarial and anti-asthmatic activities Euphorbia hirta has been reported to contain a pool of active phytochemicals that raise the medicinal value of the plant. Euphorbia hirta has been termed an \"Asthma plant\". It shows depressant effects on the respiratory system and reflexive effects on brochial tubes [32](#R135578324434613). Additionally, methanolic extraction from aerial parts of Euphorbia hirta by bioassay-guided fractionation has been evaluated for antiparasitic activity against P. falciparum. The key chromatographic fraction has been reported to show over 90% inhibition at 5 North America| anti-inflammatory of transient receptor gene family||Whole plant||Mediterranean region, |Asteraceae||Rhaponticum carthamoides||Immunomodulation||Roots||Southern Siberia, Siberia, western Asia| |Cannabaceae||Humulus lupulus||Immunomodulation; antiviral activity against cold and influenza viruses, herpesvirus and hepatitis C; inhibition of antiviral activity against acute common cold||Leaves Whole plant||Upper northeastern, North and Central United States and Eastern Canada| |Elaeagnaceae||Hippophae rhamnoides||Anti-influenza activities and Immunomodulation||Fruits||Cold-temperate regions sp.||Antiviral activity against SIVmac251, HSV-2, HIV-1 and HIV-2||Roots||North and South America, Southern Africa and Madagascar, Mediterranean nilotica||Inhibits HIV influenza and cold viruses; relieves cough, against virus, HSV-1, and RNA viruses including H5N1||Roots||Mediterranean area, Iran-Turan, Azerbaijan| |Geraniaceae||Pelargonium sidoides||Decreases rhinovirus infection through Whole Southwestern Himalayas, China| |Lythraceae||Punica granatum||Inhibits viral action against influenza virus and HSV-1||Fruits, Peel, Seeds||Iran to northern India, Mediterranean region| |Malvaceae||Althaea officinalis||Anti-inflammatory in diseases adaptogenic Northern and central Asia| |Rosaceae||Rubus sp.||Antiviral |Rosaceae||Rosa sp.||Immunomodulatory effects; antiviral activity America, Northwestern Africa| East, Asia, Continental Europe| |Theaceae||Camellia japonica||Strong inhibition of a member of coronavirus family that is porcine epidemic diarrhea virus through suppression of important protein and gene synthesis during replication||Whole plant, Flowers||East Asia| |Urticaceae||Urtica dioica||Inhibition antiviral against influenza A America, Europe, Asia| Antiviral activity of Euphorbia hirta Medicinal and aromatic plants have been a rich reserve for antiviral agents since time immemorial. Some of the medicinal plants with antiviral activity are listed in [Table 3](#tw-31210a1b768c). Euphorbia hirta is a medicinally as well as biologically important plant. It has been used to treat a wide variety of disorders since time immemorial [52](#R135578324434633). Euphorbia hirta has been a foremost important constituent of traditional systems of medicines, including Ayurveda medicine and TCM. It is used for the management of respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, venereal diseases, sterility, menstrual problems, kidney stones, colds, coughs, emphysema, laryngeal spasms, hay fever, bronchitis, asthma, amoebic dysentery, vomiting, for its antiretroviral potency against T lymphocyte MT4 cells. The effects of aqueous and methanolic extracts of the plant on replication of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), simian immunodeficiency virus SIVmac251 and HIV-2 were determined. The results supported the remarkable antiviral activity of both fractions against all three viruses [59](#R135578324434640). Moreover, the methanolic extract of Euphorbia hirta showed more efficacy than the aqueous extract. In another study, the role of Euphorbia hirta against dengue was demonstrated. Dengue disease is a viral disease caused by four distinct serotypic members of the family Flaviviridae and genus Flavivirus, including DENV 1-4 [60](#R135578324434641). The Euphorbia hirta plant has been regarded as a game changer in dengue management. Clinical investigation of Euphorbia hirta has been recorded against age group 30 - 35, which after the supplementation revealed an approximately 70% reduction in flu-like symptoms caused by dengue [61](#R135578324434642). The in vitro analysis of the ethanolic extract of the plant showed remarkable inhibition of plaque formation up to 85% and 34.7% against DENV-1 and DENV-2 [62](#R135578324434643), respectively. Some of the studies that have been carried out for the calculation of the anti-dengue property of Euphorbia al. 2012||The E. hirta continuously for 14 days to rat's exhibit enhancing effects on platelet count and reductive effects on clotting and bleeding time.||Rats induced thrombocytopenic by ethanol (i.p injection) |Arollado et al . 2013||The consecutive treatment of rats with E. hirta for 9 days increased mean platelet count by 80%.||Rats |Coloma et al. 2015||A surveillance study of questionnaire was executed in Agoo, La Union, Philippines demonstrated Tawa-Tawa is very high in demand against dengue.

Euphorbia hirta has also been reported to have selective antiviral activity against HSV-1 with an MIC value of 0.1 mg/ml [63](#R135578324434645). The leaf extract of Euphorbia hirta plant has been reported to impart protective cover against potato virus X in both systemic and hypersensitive hosts. The active constituent actinomycin D was systemically sensitive toward the virus X [64](#R135578324434644). Possible role of Euphorbia hirta against SARS-CoV-2 Unfortunately, communicability and COVID-19 infection are growing rapidly each day, causing huge human and economic losses globally [65](#R135578324434646). The common clinical symptoms identified among COVID-19 patients include cough, shortness of breath, fever, and respiratory symptoms (such as inflammation caused by allergy to the pathogen). Euphorbia hirta is an important medicinal plant involved in the global traditional medicine core, including Ayurvedic medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine [66](#R135578324434647). The lyophilized aqueous extract of E. hirta revealed potential antipyretic, anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions in xenografted mice and rat models. The antipyretic effects of Euphorbia hirta were evaluated via yeast-induced hyperthermia and showed potential activity at 100-400 mg/kg [67](#R135578324434648). Furthermore, writhing and hot plate tests showed anti-analgesic activity in a dose-dependent manner at 20 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg, respectively. Additionally, strong anti-inflammatory activity of E. hirta was observed in carrageenan-induced edema test rats at 100 mg/kg [68](#R135578324434649). A clinical study in dengue patients performed by S. D Pareera et al. at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital Lahore revealed that the administration of an aqueous extract of E. hirta orally enhanced the total leucocyte count and platelets in patients aged 30-55 years. Moreover, 70% of the patients showed a response of lowering flu symptoms and fever. Moreover, the ethanolic extract of Euphorbia hirta demonstrated significant inhibition of dengue virus stereotypes 1 and 2 [69](#R135578324434650). Euphorbia hirta is also known as an asthma plant and possesses remarkable activity against asthma [70](#R135578324434651). Diarrhea is a key symptom commonly identified in COVID-19 patients. Euphorbia hirta plant has been used against several gastrointestinal disorders, including diarrhea and ulcers. The methanolic extract of Euphorbia hirta has been identified with rich glucoside content, including afzelin, myrcitrin and quercitin. The antimicrobial analysis of these compounds yielded IC50 values of 1.1, 5.4 and 4.1 against malarial parasites, respectively [51](#R135578324434652). Furthermore, the plant Euphorbia hirta has been reported to have high free radical scavenging properties. The maximum DPPH scavenging activity was reported by leaves, followed by flowers, has been reported to induce potential nonspecific immune responses, such as phagocytic ratio and lysozyme activity, in an Aeromonas hydrophila pathogen-infected fish model [72](#R135578324434654). At higher concentrations, the plant was successful in eliminating Aeromonas hydrophila from the kidney and blood and enhanced the numbers of WBCs, RBCs and hemoglobin in test fish. Additionally, E. hirta leaf extract enhanced the fabrication of log2 antibodies [73](#R135578324434655). Euphorbia hirta also showed potential immunomodulatory effects against animal models. The maximum inhibition was recorded at 100 and 200 mg/kg, wherein it remarkably blocks the generation of cell-mediated cell using the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in its spike protein [75](#R135578324434657). The RBD recognizes the ACE2 binding ridge on the outer cell membrane of the host cell, which leads to smooth entrance. The SARS-CoV-2 RBD bears an ACE2-binding ridge with a more compact conformation. Moreover, two virus-binding hotspots at the RBD-ACE2 interface are stabilized by several residue changes. The methanolic extract of Euphorbia hirta roots and leaves has been reported to possess substantial angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) anti-dipsogenic and inhibition activities. The extract suppressed the activity of ACE 50% at 160 g and 90% at 500 g [76](#R135578324434658). The possible inhibition of the interface between SARS-CoV-2 and human host cells is shown in [Figure 5](#f-f2711a98df7c). Future prospects It is essential and needed of this era to continue the expansion of drug development and therapeutics based on plants and their chemical composition. Drugs and therapeutics based on plants are economical (cost effective) and are believed to be less toxic than synthetics. Cancer is a global health problem, making it difficult for scientists and researchers to overcome this ailment. Plants have assisted humanity against several malignancies in the past, and they are believed to do so currently and in the future as well. There are several drugs based on plants that have been approved for cancer chemotherapy, such as Taxol and paclitaxel. Euphorbia hirta has a substantial potential to inhibit different cancers in humans due to its rich phytochemistry and active constituents. This plant bears a unique class of compounds called euphorbins, and they are complex in structure and active in nature. Therefore, it is believed to possess remarkable pharmacological potential, which needs to be explored. It is highly recommended to push on progress in the field of potential antiviral therapeutics designed on natural products and their synthetic derivatives. Moreover, to look for therapeutics against coronaviruses, natural products have been the leading sources that have assisted human civilization in overcoming health hazards since the ages. The therapeutics designed on natural products have significant benefits over the synthetic ones, such as their cost effectiveness and miniscule or lack of side effects. Despite noteworthy developments in the field of vaccine development in this modern era, we lag behind in terms of developing breakthrough vaccines for several viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it seems to be a very difficult job to develop a potential treatment methodology for the management of such infectious viral diseases. However, plants such as Euphorbia hirta and their bioactive phytochemicals have tremendous potential to serve humanity in overcoming these infectious diseases. Based on docking studies and the antiviral properties of phytochemicals, E. hirta could also prove advantageous against coronaviruses. The rapid genomic mutations in SARS-CoV-2, HIV and HSV are the key drawbacks of antiviral therapeutics in targeting specific proteins and genes. The plant Euphorbia hirta has huge potential against COVID-19, as it showed against different viruses, such as malaria, HSV and dengue. The plant has a strong antiviral property and has significant potential to target key sites, enzymes and replication of SARS-COV-2. Therefore, we recommend clinical investigations of Euphorbia hirta against this lethal disease. Conclusions Euphorbia hirta is a valuable medicinal plant used globally in different traditional systems of medicines. It has been reported to have various bioactivities against a wide array of human disorders. Most importantly, the plant as a whole bears a huge variety of chemical entities that enhance its therapeutic potential. The plant as a whole has been shown to have remarkable antiviral potential against HIV, DANV, HSV, etc. and enhancing immune responses against pathogens. It has great potency for free radical scavenging and ACE inhibition. Therefore, these features of Euphorbia hirta may play an advantageous role throughout the management of highly infectious and deadly viral diseases such as COVID-19.
