For assistance completing the survey by phone, please call the NJ COVID-19 Vaccine Call Center at 1-855-568-0545 | | The State of New Jersey is working to bring home health agencies that are willing and able to administer the COVID-19 vaccine to their homebound clients. This survey has been developed for homebound individuals to share their information with the New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH). Please note that this homebound vaccination program is only available to residents of New Jersey. Individuals who are able to do so are encouraged to make every effort to safely attend any of the 750+ COVID-19 vaccination sites in New Jersey. Third doses are available for any individual who is moderately to severely immunocompromised and has previously received a full series (two doses) of either the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. For more information on third doses of mRNA vaccines and who is currently eligible, click [here](https://covid19.nj.gov/faqs/nj-information/testing-and-treatment/who-should-receive-additional-covid-19-vaccine-doses) (NJ Department of Health guidance) or [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html) (CDC guidance). Boosters are now available for individuals who received a full series (two doses) of the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at least five months ago, or received a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine at least two months ago. Please note that all individuals aged 5 and up are eligible to receive a Pfizer booster and all individuals aged 12 and up are eligible for a Moderna or Johnson & Johnson booster.

The CDC and FDA have approved third doses of both Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines for immunocompromised persons. These individuals are eligible for a third dose of Moderna (if 18 years or older) or Pfizer (if 5 years or older) four weeks after their second dose of a two dose series for Moderna or Pfizer. Immunocompromised may refer to anyone with weakened immune systems, including active cancer/chemotherapy patients, those with uncontrolled HIV, organ transplant recipients (including stem cell transplants), kidney dialysis patients, and those taking medications that would weaken their immune systems such as chemotherapy, anti-rejection medication after a transplant or steroids, and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, such as infliximab. | | Individuals who received Pfizer (ages 5+) or Moderna (ages 18+) primary series vaccines are eligible for their 1st booster 5 months after their 2nd primary series dose. For immunocompromised individuals who received Pfizer (ages 5+) or Moderna (ages 18+) primary series vaccines, they are eligible for their 1st booster 3 months after their 3rd dose. Individuals age 12 and older who are immunocompromised and individuals age 50 and older are eligible for their 2nd booster 4 months after their 1st booster dose. Is the homebound individual seeking a first or second booster dose? | | If interested in receiving a booster, which booster dose is the homebound individual hoping to receive?
