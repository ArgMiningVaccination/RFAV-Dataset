Healing is intensely personal, but my experience with incorporating these triumphant four has empowered me to become stronger and healthier as I live with Lyme disease. My journey has been a marriage of science, involving both modern medicine and ancient holistic practices. I recently became a Reiki Master, and this process has advanced me to a deeper level of inner growth. I perform self Reiki during my morning meditation and right before going to sleep. It has given me time to reflect on my life and strengthen my inner core. This journey has put me on a new path to wellness, where I am learning to unpack my bags and unload my unwanted negativity and fears. I have wandered through despair, depression and lived at the bottom of the valley throughout my life. Reiki has helped me climb a little higher to put these things behind me and reach higher ground. I can breathe here, relax and be more joyful, which has led me to better health along the way. We all want to reach the peak; however, the journey is in the climb, where we constantly strive for our highest mountain. You know what they say, when we reach the top, everything is downhill from there. So maybe Reiki has added that extra component, pushed me over the edge, and most of the hard work I have invested is complete, meaning my life will be a little easier now. Reiki is a Japanese technique known for helping promote healing and reduce stress. Reiki technicians will administer the technique by either laying hands on the body or hovering over it in specific areas known as chakras. These areas are life force energy centers that flow through our bodies. If our energy areas are low, we are more likely to get sick or stay sick. A Reiki treatment is very relaxing and treats the whole person, including body, mind, spirit, and emotions. Reiki is a safe and straightforward method of healing that can be used on everyone, every age, with or without medications, in sickness or health. Energy work can be described as dramatic shifts in healing happening and being recognized. We are a latticework of energies; these energies shape how we feel, think, and live. Energy therapists combine acquired knowledge and intuitive understanding of body energies in various modalities. Working with energy is a gifted skill that may seem out of the ordinary, but it is science-minded with a history dating back to the beginning of man. It works with the body's dynamic electromagnetic field to rid it of dis-harmony or stagnant patterns and bring the energies back into proper balance. Energy therapists have different skills and techniques for sensing this force ranging from the gift of seeing, hearing, or feeling energy. Energy work helps to facilitate healing and re-aligns the energies of the body. Some modalities work within the client's aura, using very minimal body contact, yet having a powerful effect on the individual. Sensations may include warmth, tingling, lightning up feeling, and intense relaxation. Energy therapies include, but are not limited to, Reiki, Polarity, Chakra balancing, and Therapeutic Touch.", "sitename": null, "date": "2018-01-01", "cleaned_text": "Work and Reiki by Lisa Torbert Most of us believe that there is an intricate connection between the mind, body, spirit, emotion, and the healing of physical illness.
