REQUIRED INFORMATION Note: Not all fields are required for all applications; see grant -specific instructions. Project Title: Do not exceed 150 characters including spaces ; avoid abbreviations if possible. Note: The title will be truncated after 81 characters on the title page. Principal Investigator/Applicant Information: Some (or all) of the required information from your Professional Profile may already be displayed. If any information is outdated, stop and update the Professional Profile before completing this section and submitting an application. Please keep all contact information current. Key Personnel: Individuals who contribute to the scientific development or execution of a project in a substantive and measurable way (whether or not they receive salaries or compensation under the grant) are considered Key Personnel. The PI is always considered Key Personnel , but do not list them under key personnel on ProposalCentral . Key Personnel can include individuals at the master's or baccalaureate level (such as graduate students and research assistants) if they meet this definition. \" Zero percent\" or \"as needed\" are not acceptable levels of involvement. The Principal Investigator assumes the authority and responsibility to direct the project. The ACS does not permit applications to be directed by co-Principal Investigators. A Co-Investigator is a vital scientific contributor (at the same or a different institution), often bringing a needed expertise to the research team. This person commit s some level of measurable effort to the project and is therefore Key Personnel , whether compensated or not. A Collaborator plays a lesser role in the thinking and logistics of the project than co-investigator. Depending on the role and effort, a collaborator may be designated as Key Personnel and may be compensated. A Consultant provides expert advice, most often for a fee. If the consultant contributes to the scientific development or execution of a project substantively and measurably, he or she should be designated as Key Personnel . Other is defined as individuals who are compensated for their contribution to the project but are not considered Key P ersonnel (e.g. , student assistants, technical staff). A Mentor assists in the scientific and professional development of the mentee. A Primary Mentor should be identified and listed as Key Personnel ONLY for Postdoctoral Fellowships and Clinician Scientist Development Grants. If additional mentors are identified, they should also be listed as Key Personnel. The table below provides information about the documents required for each personnel class . See grant -specific instructions for detailed guidance.

GENERAL AUDIENCE SUMMARY The general audience summary provides an overview of the proposed research for people who are not trained in the sciences . This summary may be read by peer review stakeholders , ACS staff members, potential donors , and the public . Stakeholders are individuals without formal scientific or medical training who are full voting members of peer review panels. The stakeholder uses the general summary to evaluate how the proposed work will benefit cancer patients and their families . ACS staff members use these summaries to identify projects that align with the specific interests of donors and may share them with donors . Staff may use the s ummary for communicating to local media about ACS -funded studies . Summaries of all grants funded by the Society are also made available to the public . Therefore, do not include proprie tary/confidential information. The general audience summary should not duplicate the structured technical abstract and should be written in an understandable way for the general public . Describe concisely the background, significance, question(s) being asked, information to be obtained, and potential impact of your proposed research. If symbols or Greek characters must be used, they should be spelled out to avoid formatting problems. See examples of General Audience S ummaries in Appendix A. This form is limited to 3, 100 characters including spaces and will truncate at that point . Comply with the character limit to permit readers (including peer reviewers) to fully appreciat e the \"big-picture perspective\" of the proposal. 6. STRUCTURED TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Note: Not all applications require a structured technical abstract . If this abstract is required there will be a space for it on ProposalCentral . The structured technical abstract is a summary of the proposed research or scholarly project for general scientific audiences . See examples of Structured Technical Abstracts in Appendix B. Organize the abstract into the following sections : Background Objective/H ypothesis Specific A ims Study D esign 7 American Cancer Society Grant Application Instructions Revised in July 2023 This form is limited to 3, 100 characters including spaces and will truncate at that point. Comply with the character limit to permit peer reviewers to fully appreciate the technical synopsis. The American Cancer Society may share the structure d technical abstract under a non-disclosure agreement with a third party . Therefore, do not include proprietary information. Please notify us if you do not wish to have your abstract utilized in this manner. 7. STATEMENT OF CANCER RELEVANCE AND IMPACT This section is important to the stakeholders (non- scientific members) on the peer review committees as well as to several general audiences, including donors. Avoid the use of technical jargon. This form is limited to 1,5 00 characters including spaces and will truncate at that point. Describe how the project contributes short - and lo ng-term to the control of cancer. For basic studies relying on experimental models (rather than human cancer cells, tissues, or clinical data) explain how the successful completion of the proposed work will lead to a better understanding of the disease or improve our ability to prevent, detect, treat , or manage cancer or cancer patients. For studies involving human subjects, what do you expect to learn about how access to care impacts the overall cancer burden? How could your study improve both delivery of care and cancer outcomes? What effects do you anticipate on the morbidity, mortality, and/or quality of life of your study population? How might further investigations find potential value for health policy? 8. JUSTIFICATION OF PROJECT ALIGNMENT T O RESEARCH PRIORITIES Explain how your proposed project aligns to the selected research priority /priorities . If your project aligns to multiple priority areas, provide additional justification of the alignment to those areas in this section as well . Please make sure that the priority area or areas are noted in the statement. Note: This form is limited to 1,500 characters, including spaces. If the character limit is exceeded in this section, which is evaluated, it will be truncated. Examples of research priority alignment statements are provided in Appendix C. 9. SELECTION OF RESEARCH PRIORITIES Select the research priority or priorities to which your proposed project most strongly aligns and indicate the percent alignment. If multiple priorities are selected, the total should equal 100%. You are required to select a research priority area. Descri ptions of the research priorities can be found in the All Grant Applications Policies document (pages 4- 6). 10. PROJECT CODING Note: Project coding is not considered at peer review. Red asterisks indicate required fields; not all grant types require project coding. Donors often have interest s in funding specific types of cancer research. Your s election of project code s permits identification of proposals for consideration of donor -driven special funding. This information also assists the Society in communicating our research portfolio to the public. Select the most appropriate Areas of Research (Common Scientific Outline \u2014CSO) and Types of Cancer .

Applicants proposing multi -level health equity research must also target two or more levels of influence (individual, interpersonal, organizational, community, or public policy) and foc us on contributing to achieving health equity. Applicants are at liberty to use more than one model to describe the theoretical underpinning of their research approach. Discuss potential difficulties and limitations of your proposed methods and provide alt ernative approaches. Inclusion of an experimental timeline can be helpful. F. Potential for Knowledge Transfer and Experimental Details (3 pages or less) . Create a clearly defined plan of how the results of the study will be used to develop future research and how it will practically impact cancer health equity. Concisely describe how the findings will be disseminated. Describe potential application of study findings to the work of ACS. This section is also available if more in -depth description of the study design, technologies, or other aspects are needed to convey the specific approaches and procedures proposed. G. Environment . Briefly describe the space and equipment available to carry out the proposed research (e.g., space designated specifically for your research program, shared space and/or core facilities). Investigators must have an institutional commitment of research facilities, and the amount of committed space must be verified (see Statement of Institutional Support in Section 13 below). This s ection is required and especially important for all non- tenure track applicants. H. Statement of Science Outreach and Advocacy (not to exceed 1 page) . ACS considers it important that scientists communicate the results of their research to a wide range of 15 American Cancer Society Grant Application Instructions Revised in July 2023 communities. Explain the potential impact of your proposed project on your community, and to the ACS's mission to save lives, celebrate lives, and lead the fight for a world without cancer. Share any previous experiences in science outreach and advocacy. Descr ibe your plans for disseminating your work in the cancer arena through advocacy, awareness, education, or service.

For applications submitted in April, use a start date of January 1 of the next year. For applications submitted in October, use a start date of July 1 of the next year. A. Personnel. Names and positions of all key personnel must be individually listed, and the percentage of time to be devoted to the project by each person should be entered. List all key personnel (defined as individuals who will participate actively in the design and/or execution of the studies) other than the PI. Details of contractual arrangements with key personnel should be provided in the Justification of Budget section . If the individual has not been selected, please list as \"vacancy.\" Personnel may receive salary support up to a maximum that equals the NIH salary cap, prorated according to their percent effort on the project. If a Key Person is not receiving salary, you can request $0 for salary, but their percent effort is still required. Their effort and contribution to the project should be outlined in the Budget Justification even if they are not being compensated. The costs to the institution of employee fringe benefits should be indicated as a percent of the employee's salary. The amount of fringe benefits requested must be prorated to the salary requested. For example, if 50 percent of an individual's annual salary is requested, then no more than 50 percent of that individual's annual cost for fringe benefits can be requested. NOTE: See above for definitions of key personnel . The Society does not cover the costs of student tuition or fees for graduate or undergraduate students. B. Equipment Permanent equipment. Defined as items of nonexpendable property with a purchase cost per unit that equals or exceeds $5,000 with a useful life of more than one year. List separately and justify the need for each item of permanent equipment. Note: the cost of permanent equipment is not included in the direct cost total used to calculate i ndirect costs. Small or expendable equipmen t. Defined as expendable property with a purchase cost per unit that is less than $5,000 and/or that has a short service life (<1 year). Note: Equipment that equals or exceeds $5,000 with a useful life of more than one year is not included in the direct cost total used to calculate indirect costs. 16 American Cancer Society Grant Application Instructions Revised in July 2023 General purpose equipment. Equipment such as computers used primarily or exclusively in the actual conduct of the proposed scientific project are considered direct costs and may be included in the direct cost total used to calculate i ndirect costs. Computers or other general -purpose equipment that will be used on multiple projects or for personal use are not allowable expenditures . C. Supplies. Group supplies into major categories (e.g. , glassware, chemicals, radioisot opes, survey materials, animals, etc.). D. Travel. Any foreign travel requires pre -approval by your Scientific Office. Domestic travel expenses do not require pre- approval. E. Miscellaneous Expenditures. List specific amounts for each item. Examples of allowed expenditures include publication costs and special fees (e.g., pathology, computer time and scientific software, and equipment maintenance). F. Subcontracts. If any portion of the propos ed research is to be carried out a t another institution, enter the total direct costs on the online budget detail page on ProposalCentral . Each subcontract should be listed separately. Then provide a categorical breakdown of costs using the Subcontractor Budget and Justification form, using one form per subcontractor. Upload the form(s) when complete, entering the subcontractor's name in the \"describe attachment\" field. Subcontracts for the research project may be with public or private institutions, p rovide d they do not violate ACS policies. Subcontracts invo lving a contractor residing outside the borders of the United States are not permitted, unl ess the applicant can document that it is not feasible to ha ve the work performed within the United States. Administ rative pages: A Letter of Agreement between institutions p ertaining to the subcontract should be included in the Appendix. G. Indirect Costs. To help the institution provide proper laboratory and clinical facilities, the Society will permit an indirect cost allowance of up to 20% of the direct costs, excluding permanent equipment. If there is a subcontract (s), i ndirect costs can be provided to the secondary institution through negotiation with the Principal Investigator's institution but the total amount of indirect costs, inclusive of subcontracts, may not exceed 20% of the award. If a subcontract is receiving indirect costs, list the indirect costs for each institution separately in the indirect costs section of the budget form. Example: Budget Indirect Costs Year 1 for Standard RSG Primary Institution Indirect 20% primary institution direct cost total Subcontract 1 Indirect 20% subcontract 1 direct cost total Subcontract 2 Indirect 20% subcontract 2 direct cost total Total Indirect Costs $40,000 IDC Note: Applicants should not budget above or below the allowable indirect cost rate. H. Total Amount Requested. Budget totals should reflect a maximum duration of 4 years. The maximum allowable budget is $960,000: $200,000 direct cost s per year and 20% indirect costs ($40,000) for the 4 -year project period . Starting Fall 2023, all new RSG applications across all research programs must be 4 -year projects . Resubmission of applications that were previously submitted for RSGI or RSG -HE applications under different guidelines will be allowed. 17 American Cancer Society Grant Application Instructions Revised in July 2023 The amount on the application title page should match the total costs in the detailed budget section. Note: For budgets that do not request the maximum allowable amount, if the grant is funded, the ACS will round the total to the nearest thousand dollars . We encourage applicants to request a budget amount that is rounded to an even thousand dollars . 9. JUSTIFICATION OF BUDGET Provide budget justification on the template. Justify all items of permanent equipment costing over $5,000, as well as your needs for personnel, supplies, travel, and other miscellaneous items. If the budget includes a request for funds to be expended outside the United States or its territories, include an explanation of why such costs are essential for the successful conduct of the project, and why there are no alter natives. Provide details of contractual arrangements with key personnel in this section. 10. BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION OF KEY PERSONNEL (PAGE 5.1) Provide information for all key personnel involved in the project. Complete the NIH Biosketch template. NOTE: Follow the format and instructions provided by the NIH. 11. OTHER SUPPORT (PAGE 6.1) The ACS does not fund projects that are supported all or in part by another agency. Projects are considered to overlap if there are any shared Specific Aims or areas of budgetary overlap. The ACS Scientific Director make s final decisions regarding any questions of overlap. The only exceptions are: Funds provided by the institution as start -up support to develop a new laboratory or to gather pilot data; and Awards that provide only salary support for the P I. In the latter case, if the salary support for the PI's contribution to the project is covered by the other agency , no additional salary support for the PI may be requested from the ACS. Provide the following information separately for the PI and all other Key Personnel: A. Current Support. List all current funding from intramural and extramural sources (e.g., institutional awards and grants from for -profit and not -for-profit agencies, including other grants from the ACS). Provide for each award: a. Source of funds b. Grant number c. Project title d. Inclusive dates of approved or proposed project. For example, in the case of NIH support, provide the dates of the approved or proposed competitive segment. e. Total direct costs f. Role (e.g., PI, co -PI, co -I, etc.) and p ercent effort or person- months. For an act ive project, use person months, even if unsalaried for the current budget period. Classify person- months as academic, calendar, and/or summer. g. An outline of the goals of the project in a brief paragraph. h. A clear indication of overlap and differences betwe en this grant and the proposed study. If necessary, include an explanatory letter in the Appendix. 18 American Cancer Society Grant Application Instructions Revised in July 2023 B. Pending Support. List all pending applications for funding from intramural and extramural sources (e.g., institutional awards and grants from for -profit and not -for-profit agencies, including other grants from the ACS). a.

Total direct costs e. Role (e.g., PI, co -PI, co -I, etc.) and p ercent effort or person- months. For an active project, use person months, even if unsalaried, for the current budget period. Classify person- months as academic, calendar, and/or summer. f. An outline of the goals of the project in a brief paragraph. g. A clear indication of overlap and differences between this grant and the proposed study. If necessary, include an explanatory letter in the Appendix. In such cases, you may accept only one award if both are approved for funding. The ACS does not negotiate partial funding of grants with overlapping specific aims. Please notify the Scientific Director if a pending extramural grant is funded during the peer review process since this could affect the feasibility of the PI's proposed effort ( for cases of no scientific overlap) and possibly eligibility (for cases of scientific overlap). C. Institutional Support . Provide the following information for the Principal Investigator only: a. A description of any start -up funds provided by the institution to the applicant. An award of start- up funds does not decrease the likelihood of ACS support and can be important evidence of institutional commitment. b.

These may include, but are not limited to, cell lines, specialty chemicals, antibodies, and other biologics. Researchers should transparently report how they have authenticated key resources, so consensus can emerge. Standard laboratory reagents that are not expected to vary do not need to be included in the plan (e.g., buffers and other common biologicals or chemicals). After reviewers assess the information you provide in this Section, their questions will need to be addressed prior to an award. In this section, focus only on authentication and/or validation of key resources to be used in the study. Include all other information within the page limits of the research strategy. Applications that fail to comply may be dismissed. Cancer Health Equity Research Statement (750-words) Applicants proposing health- equity research must upload a Cancer Health Equity Statement ( Page 8.3). In it, summarize the targeted area(s) of health equity, study population, and how the proposed research can contribute to improving health equity relevant to cancer. How will your anticipated findings advance the field? This must per tain to an aspect of the cancer continuum and one or more of the social determinants of health. Examples of research in this area include, but are not limited to, improvements in: risk reduction behaviors; access to cancer prevention; early detection, diagnosis, and/or treatment services; reducing cancer morbidity, mortality, symptom burden, or costs; and quality of care, quality of life, or health policy impact. 14.

SAMPLE OF GENERAL AUDIENCE SUMMARY The American Cancer Society Institutional Research Grant (ACS IRG) is an essential component used by the University to recruit new faculty into cancer research and promote nurturing ideas of junior faculty already involved in cancer research. Over the year s, the ACS IRG has successfully fostered cancer interests among young investigators, providing them with a mechanism by which they can obtain small grants for testing their ideas, and positioning them to successfully compete for extramural peer -reviewed research grants. The leadership of the University, and especially the Comprehensive Cancer Center, understands that new ideas, many of which come from new researchers in their first faculty positions, can have a substantial impact on the advancement of biom edical research. The institution has added a substantial number of junior faculty over the past decade in diverse disciplines that that range from basic molecular biology to psychosocial sciences. This has enlarged the pool of eligible applicants for ACS I RG funding. In addition, the institutional IRG program has placed increasing emphasis on the identification of potential applicants, which has resulted in a substantial increase in the number of applications. Consequently, the institution's IRG review comm ittee has expanded and diversified. The present renewal application also includes a new mentoring plan to assure that awardees are properly advised once an award is made and receive training that will help them to secure peer - reviewed funding. Recognizing the importance and prestige of the American Cancer Society Institutional Research Grant for young investigators and to help attract the best young scientists, the University and Cancer Center have committed $15,000 in matching funds for each ACS IRG pilot project award, bringing the $4 0,000 award to $5 5,000 per investigator. The ACS IRG also plays an important role in fostering the extensive interaction between the University and the American Cancer Society. Over the years, this relationship has been mutually beneficial to both organizations, but more importantly to the area's cancer patients and their families. CRITERIA FOR THE REVIEW OF APPLICATIONS The following items are used by reviewers in evaluating applications for IRGs. 1. REPL Y TO PREVIOUS REVIE W State whether the application is a resubmission or renewal. Renewal applications must include the critiques of the previous application, and document progress made toward addressing the points made by the reviewers. For resubmitted applications, detail the candidate's responsiveness to previous critiques, focusing on the strengths and weaknesses of their reply. 2. DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM Provide an overview of the academic environment, and the potential applicant pool size. Describe unique aspects of the institution or any strategic efforts underway to expand cancer -related activities, especially research, which could impact faculty recruitment. How will faculty be recruited? Describe the institution(s) applying for an IRG. Detail the expertise of their research programs, and availability of early career investigators who can apply for funding. How will the IRG be used to leverage resources to support the institution's beginning cancer researchers? If this application is a renewal of an IRG that is no longer in effect, and for which funding has lapsed for more than one year, an explanation should be provided. 32 American Cancer Society Grant Application Instructions Revised in July 2023 3. CAREER DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES FOR BEGINNING INVESTIGATORS Describe the mentoring and career development activities proposed. What formal mechanisms will be used to foster early career investigators? How will the success of these activities be evaluated? Are the proposed activities relevant and appropriate for cancer research career development? 4. LOCAL COMMITTEE COMPOSITION What is the composition of the review panel? What are the panel members' areas of expertise? What is the term for appointees? What are the qualifications of the committee chair PI? Is there broad representation across all schools and departments from which applications are expected? Will ACS representatives be participating in the commi ttee? 5. INTERACTION WITH LOCAL ACS How will IRG recipients engage with their local ACS? What activities are planned, and how are these activities advertised, supported, and prioritized? Is there evidence of interaction between the institution, including IRG pilot project grantees, and the local ACS Region office or with ACS CAN. In some areas of the country, this is the only ACS grant there is, and special consideration should be given for these interactions. 6. PROCEDURE FOR PUBLICIZING AVAILABILITY OF F UNDS How will IRG funding be advertised? What methods of communication will be used? How frequently will funding availability be advertised? Do all departments and schools know about the grant? Are the numbers of applicants commensurate with the pool size? 7. OPERATIONS - HOW ALLOCATIONS ARE TO BE MADE The committee's sole charge should be to review the ACS IRG applications, and not any applications funded from other sources. Does the committee meet once or twice each year? How does the committee avoid conflicts of interest? Is there appropriate rotation after several years of service? How are applications ranked? Is there feedback to the applicants? 8. JUSTIFICATION OF FUNDS REQUESTED What other cancer research support is available at the institution? Is the projected or actual applicant pool size sufficient to justify the funds requested? If this is a renewal application, how does the number of applications align with the reported pool size? Is the amount requested adequate to fund all the outstanding applications? Conversely, are non- meritorious applications being funded? There should be detailed information about any funds provided by the institution to supplement the pilot project awards or the overall grant. 9. DOCUMENTATION OF POOL SIZE (new applications only) How many junior investigators interested in cancer research are presently at the institution, and how many are expected to be recruited over the next few years? Is this pool sufficient? 10. EXAMPLES OF RESEARCH TO BE SUPPORTED (new applications only) Are the examples of pilot projects relevant to cancer, and is the potential research high quality? 11. APPLICATIONS AND AWARDS - TABLES I, II, V (renewal applications only) How many applications are received, approved, a nd funded? What is the funding rate? What is the range of priority scores? Are the grantees made aware that this money comes from the ACS rather 33 American Cancer Society Grant Application Instructions Revised in July 2023 than the institution? Are pilot project grants distributed broadly across the institution, or concentrated in one school or center? 12. PUBLICATIONS AND GRANTS - TABLES III, IV, VI, INDIVIDUAL PROGRESS REPORTS (renewal applications only) Consider the overall productivity of the researcher supported by IRG funds, including all publications and grants not just those resulting from IRG pilot projects. Tracking of publications and awards should go back for seven years (excluding the current year) or the length of the award, if less. How many articles were published that are relevant to IRG funding? How many extram ural awards have been obtained by IRG grantees? The cancer relevance of the research supported by individual allocations is also a factor in the evaluation of renewal requests for continued support. 34 American Cancer Society Grant Application Instructions Revised in July 2023 DISCOVERY BOOST GRANT INSTRUCTIONS PREPARING THE APPLICATION 1.

REVIEWER GUIDELINE CRITERIA Evaluation of New Research Professor/Clinical Research Professor Applications For each section, focus on the strengths and weaknesses. Your final score should align with your written critiq ue. 1. OBJECTIVE Briefly d escribe the overarching goal(s) of the research program and the general aims and potential impact of the proposed project. 2. INVESTIGATOR Has the applicant made at least one seminal contribution to their field (a key requirement for consideration of this award) ? If so, assess the impact, to date, of the contribution or contributions. Is the investigator regarded as a \"thought leader\"? Is the applicant continuing to be a leader in their area(s) of expertise? Are their contributions more intellectual or technical in nature? Does the investigator have a track record of high- impact publications and awards? Is the investigator a leader in the cancer research community? Consider the content of the Letters of Recommendation and the summary table of scholarly successes in the Appendix when critically evaluating the applicant. 3. RESEARCH PROGRAM Evaluate the significance, cancer relevance, and novelty of the investigator's overall research program. Has the applicant identified and adequately justified the seminal contri bution(s) that their research program has made to cancer research? In what innovative way(s) is the applicant's cancer research program addressing a critical unmet need? Does this program have a likelihood of continued high impact discoveries for cancer research? 4. STRATEGIC PLAN The research plan is not intended to be as specific or detailed as a Research Scholar Grant, but must be scientifically sound, justified, and include a novel aspect of work for the investigator. The award is intended to support the testing of innovative ideas, not simply to supplement ongoing projects. Evaluate the significance, cancer relevance, and novelty of the proposed strategic plan. Has the applicant identified an unmet need or gap in the field, and will their strategic plan fill the void? Does the proposed project explore a new concept (technically and/or conceptually) rather than a continuation of current investigations? Is the applicant proposing a creative use of the discretionary funds? Are there other investigators doing similar work? In the case of Clinical Research Professor applications, a clinical component should be included. Has the applicant adequately articulated their vision for advancing their research discipline in the next 5 years? Will this vision advance scientific knowledge or aspects of clinical practice for cancer and cancer patients? 5. MENTORSHIP Evaluate the evidence that the applicant has successfully mentored trainees, colleagues, etc . This may include, but is not limited to, the number of graduate students/residents and postdoctoral fellows that have gone on to successful positions in cancer research or junior faculty members who have been promoted and/or tenured. Mentoring may also be demonstrated through educational/training activities. Does the investigator have a track record of mentoring trainees who have gone on to be successful in research? Is there evidence of a current commitment to mentoring? 89 American Cancer Society Grant Application Instructions Revised in July 2023 6. SERVICE Evaluate the applicant's commitment to service in the scientific community and beyond. This could be demonstrated in many ways including scientific leadership at an institutional, national or international level, community outreach, and advocacy. While this could be demonstrated through service to the American Cancer Society, this is not required. A lack of prior participation in Society - sponsored activities should not be viewed as a weakness. Will the applicant be a strong representative of and spokesperson for the American Cancer Society? Evaluati on of Renewal Research Professor /Clinical Research Professor Applications: For each section, focus on the strengths and weaknesses. Your final score should align with your written critique. 1. OVERVIEW The renewal should focus on both the project as funded along with their entire research program.

Assess the Professor's service to the cancer community, with particular emphasis on their role as a spokesperson for the ACS and the ACS research program the past five years. 90 American Cancer Society Grant Application Instructions Revised in July 2023 APPENDIX A: EXAMPLES OF GENERAL AUDIENCE SUMMARIES Note: Some grant mechanisms do not require General Audience Summaries. If required for the application, there will be a field for the General Audience Summary on ProposalCentral . 1. Clinical and Epidemiology Research Title: Characterization of Early Breast Cancer by Contrast -Enhanced MRI Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows great promise as a supplementary tool to mammography and clinical exam for diagnosis and staging of breast cancer. Most research in this area has focused on diagnosis of invasive breast cancer. We have been interested in improving the ability of MRI to characterize early cancer, particularly at the pre- invasive stage. At the present time, the accuracy of MRI to for diagnosing pre- invasive breast disease, or ductal carcinoma in sit u (DCIS) is low, mainly because the pattern of contrast enhancement for DCIS is difficult to distinguish from that of benign proliferative disease in the breast. An important emerging application for MRI is screening and surveillance in women at increased risk of developing breast cancer. There are now genetic tests and statistical models that can accurately predict a woman's risk. However, there are few effective options for prevention and early detection. Women with a genetic risk of developing cancer are also likely to develop cancer at an early age when breast tissue is dense and mammography effectiveness is limited. MRI is very sensitive to small cancers and not limited by breast density. The studies we propose will address the specificity of MRI for early cancer and will have direct application to MRI screening and surveillance methods. We believe that in the future, a better understanding of the biological basis of patterns on MRI may lead to new methods for identifying breast tissue that is at risk fo r developing cancer. 2. Cancer Control and Prevention Research Title: Distrust as a Barrier to Cancer Screening and Prevention Over the past 40 years technological advancements have had a major impact on medicine in the United States . These advancements have led to the development of effective methods in cancer screening and, most recently, cancer prevention. These methods have the potential to greatly reduce the burden of cancer but are being threatened by the rising levels of distrust of physicians and the health care system . This project will investigate the issue of distrust with the goals of increasing understanding of health care related distrust in the US today and investigating the relationship between health care related distrust and attitudes, intentions, and behaviors regarding cancer screening and prevention. We will focus on a population composed of African American, Caucasian, and Hispanic women to elucidate the relationship between health care related distrust and historically disadvantaged ethnic/racial minorities . These women will be between the ages of 40 and 70, a group for whom effective cancer screening is available and recommended. In order to determine the patterns of health care related distrust and association between distrust and attitudes towards cancer screening and prevention, we will conduct a population- based telephone survey in the United States . We will examine several types of cancer related health behaviors and investigate how distrust may act as a barrier to adopting thes e behaviors . These behaviors will include adherence with current cancer screening recommendations for breast, cervical and colon cancer as well as willingness to use new interventions for cancer screening and prevention. This project builds upon our prior work that has provided a more in- depth understanding of health care related distrust and established the association between health care related distrust and use of Pap smear, clinical breast examination, and influenza vaccination in the City of Philadelphia. This grant will allow us to identify the factors and beliefs the population may have about health care and physicians and determine what role distrust plays as a barrier to cancer screening and prevention . 91 American Cancer Society Grant Application Instructions Revised in July 2023 These findings will have the direct potential to improve the delivery of effective cancer screening and prevention behaviors. 3. Developmental Research Title: Regulation of Chromosome Segregation in Human Cells The information which controls all the operations of a cell is contained within its DNA, which is packaged into units called chromosomes . When a cell divides, these chromosomes must be duplicated. During duplication each chromosome is connected to its copy, therefore, the duplicated chromosomes must be properly unlinked from one another, so that each new cell receives or inherits exactly the same genetic information as all of the other cells . Errors in this process, known as chromosome segregation, result in extra chromosomes in some cells and too few chromosomes in others . Such errors are widespread among most cancer cells and are believed to promote the growth and progression of disease . Our long- term goal is to understand the molecules and mechanisms that control chromosome segregation in human cells . Towards this aim, we have begun to analyze a critical enzyme, appropriately named separase, which functions like a \"molecular scissors\" to split apart linked chromosomes as cells prepare to divide. Separase acts irreversibly in this process and thus needs to be controlled very precisely, to avoid potentially catastrophic errors . In this proposal, we will investigate the ways in which separase is turned on and turned off during cell division. Using a series of complementary approaches, including a novel method we invented several years ago for manipulating genes inside human cells, we will define how the chromosome-splitting process is controlled at the molecular level, and how that control ensures the high level of accuracy of chromosome segregation . Ultimately, we hope to translate this knowledge into new strategies for detecting and eliminating cells that cannot segregate their chromosomes accurately, before they have the opportunity to develop into cancers. 92 American Cancer Society Grant Application Instructions Revised in July 2023 APPENDIX B: EXAMPLE OF STRUCTURED TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Title: Structure and Function of DNA Replication Origins in Yeast Background: The initiation of DNA replication marks a crucial step in the eukaryotic cell cycle . Entering S phase commits the cell to a full round of cell division. Studies in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae , have driven the field during the past decade, although our data and work by others suggest that many aspects of DNA replication are highly conserved in all eukaryotes, including humans. Origin structure has been best described for autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) function. Different origins have a different domain organization, and it is unclear how these differences impact the initiation of DNA replication. Recently, we have shown that initiation events occur at distinct nucleotide positions in yeast, a feature that appears to be conserved in humans. Objective/Hypothesis: Our preliminary studies indicate that origin organization dictates where replication initiates. Therefore, we propose to define how features of ARS elements contribute to the precise initiation mechanism. Specific Aims : (1) To determine whether chromosomal origins other than ARS1 initiate DNA replication at a distinct site; (2) to identify what determines the replication start point within origins; and (3) to determine if chromatin structure affects the initiation pattern at ARS elements. Study design: Using a technique that we have recently developed, replication initiation point mapping, we will first map the nucleotide positions at which replication initiates in wild- type and mutant ARS elements. T o address the issue of what role chromatin configuration plays in origin activation, we will analyze the nucleosome organization of different ARS loci in relation to those regions where the parental DNA double- strand unwinds firs t. We will correlate the sites of initiation with sites of unwinding and place those into context with the overall chromatin structure at a given chromosomal ARS locus. Cancer relevance: These studies will contribute to our understanding of the mechanism underlying origin activation in yeast and will aid us in understanding origin function in more complex, higher eukaryotes. Since uncontrolled origin activity directly translates into unco ntrolled growth, the long- term goal of our studies is to apply our knowledge and techniques to human DNA replication in order to inhibit proliferation of cancerous cells. 93 American Cancer Society Grant Application Instructions Revised in July 2023 APPENDIX C: EXAMPLES OF PROJECT ALIGNMENT TO RESEARCH PRIORITIES Example 1 Epiluminescent microscopy is used for the clinical evaluation of pigmented skin lesions, including early -stage melanoma. However, several common benign skin conditions can sometimes exhibit hyperpigmentation leading to unnecessary surgical excision. We have recently discovered that amplification of gene X is associated with early -stage melanoma. Based on encouraging preclinical validation, we propose to develop a non -invasive, light -based companion diagnostic assay to identify early -stage melanoma (i.e., during an annual skin exam). This concept, which is technically and conceptually innovative, highly aligns with the ACS priority area screening and early detection. Selection of Priorities Screening and Diagnosis: 100% Example 2 The focus of this investigation is to elucidate how cancer stem cells in triple negative breast cancers resist chemotherapies with the goal of developing new strategies for anti -cancer drug design (Treatment as the primary priority). The mechanistic insights we glean from the ability of cancer stem cells to continuously self -renew could also lead to the development of improved prognostic and diagnostic markers (Screening and Diagnosis) as well as a better understanding of the cells that drive tumorigenesis and disease recurrence (Etiology). Selection of Priorities Etiology: 25% Screening and Diagnosis: 25% Treatment: 50% Example 3 Underlying genetic mutations in leukemia cells are a significant factor in the risk and outcomes in childhood acute leukemia. One specific type of genetic mutation is found in multiple subtypes of acute leukemia associated with a poor prognosis. In this project, we will characterize this and other mutations in blood samples from acute leukemia patients in a large- scale study to identify potential markers that can be used to diagnose acute leukemia (Screening and Diagnosis). This analysis will also be used to identify proteins specific to acute leukemia that may be targeted therapeutically (Treatment). Selection of Prio rities Screening and Diagnosis: 85% Treatment: 15% Example 4 Children with refractory or relapsed solid tumors remain essentially incurable with conventional chemotherapy and radiation, and the effects of these treatments are life threatening. Current \"tumor - specif ic\" treatments, such as infusion of natural killer immune cells, have had limited success. This project will use several approaches to improve refractory solid tumor by testing an antibody recognized neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma tumor cells. Success of any of these approaches will be a breakthrough for children with refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma. Selection of Priorities Treatment: 100% 94 American Cancer Society Grant Application Instructions Revised in July 2023 Example 5 Prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis and mortality rates are higher in African American (AA) men compared to Caucasian- American (CA) men. AA patients respond poorly to treatments, and the PCa tumors are more aggressive than those in CA patients. We have identified a cellular dysfunction in tumors from AA PCa patients that may contribute to treatment in AA patients. In this project we will screen AA PCa tumors for this dysfunction (Etiology) and determine if treatments that target the cellular dysfunction in AA PCa cells can help improve treatment outcomes for AA patients (Treatment). Selection of Priorities Etiology: 20% Treatment: 80% Example 6 Lung cancer survivors have a high symptom burden. Prior research has demonstrated that early palliative care improves quality of life. Cancer rehabilitation plays an important role in survivorship care by facilitating participation in daily liv ing. This study involves collaboration between palliative care and cancer rehabilitation teams. We will compare a novel home- based intervention to in- person ambulatory rehabilitation and evaluate objecti ve measures of pulmonary functioning, physical functioning, and health related quality of life. This aligns with the ACS survivorship priority. Selection of Priorities Survivorship: 100% Example 7 ACS believes that everyone should have a fair and just opportunity to prevent, find, treat and survive cancer. Where you live and your income may impact the ability to receive high quality cancer care. Our preliminary data reveal that distance from a primary care provider impacts screening rates for breast, lung and colorectal cancer. To increase screening rates in a diverse group of low wage workers, we will test a culturally tailored worksite intervention for farm and poultry workers and use a waitlist co ntrol group. The social determinants of health we believe are drivers of differential screening outcomes include low socioeconomic status, inadequate health insurance coverage and low health literacy. Selection of Priorities Health Equity: 100% Example 8 According to the ACS Facts and Figures, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and third leading cause of death among men and women in the US. Trend data, especially over the last decade, reveals increased CRC incidence for individuals un der the age of 50. This study aims to better understand the birth cohort effect and involves mixed methods to better understand factors associated with early onset CRC. Our findings will be used to inform a larger tailored intervention to improve early diagnosis of CRC under the age of 50 years. This aligns with the ACS research priority for screening and diagnosis.
