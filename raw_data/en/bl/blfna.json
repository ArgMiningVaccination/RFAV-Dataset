One key coping skill to better manage panic attacks is the use of meditation. Meditation is a self-regulation technique that affords one the ability to approach your thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations from a nonjudgmental place.1 Meditation practices may intercept panic attack triggers as they offer mind-body self-soothing when practiced consistently. What Are Panic Attacks? [Panic attacks](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/panic-attack/) are a sudden surge of physical symptoms paired with intense dread. This occurs when an individual is under intense distress, which leads to their [fight or flight response](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/fight-or-flight-response/) system being activated. The physical symptoms include labored breath, racing heart, chest tightness, sweating, and trembling. A [panic disorder](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/panic-disorder/) is a type of anxiety disorder where a person experiences frequent panic attacks along with fear of panic attacks continuing. This differs from [anxiety](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/anxiety/) in that anxiety is more of a constant experience rather than episodic and centered around worry and nervousness. Panic disorders affect an estimated 12 million adolescents and adults each year in the United States.2 Signs of Panic Attacks People may experience and respond to panic attacks differently. However, there are tell-tale signs that most people go through. People often [mistake panic attacks for heart attacks](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/panic-attack-vs-heart-attack/), and even feel they may die, given how strong the physical sensations are. Common signs of a panic attack include:3 - Shortness of breath - Rapid heartbeat - Difficulty breathing - Sweating - Trembling - Tingling sensation in extremities - Sensation of one's throat closing - Dizziness - Nausea - Headache - Ringing in one's ears What Is Meditation? [Meditation](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/meditation/) is a practice of harnessing one's attention on an object, thoughts, or activity to quiet a racing mind and increase self-compassion. The key word here is practice. Meditation is not something that can be achieved through perfection. Common types of meditation include: - Guided meditation: A guided meditation is a meditation practice that is led by a teacher. This can be in person, via video, or recorded via audio/video. Some find guided meditations to be extra supportive when starting their meditation practice. - Focused meditation: A [focused meditation](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/focused-meditation/)is turning one's attention toward something in order to remain present. For example, turning attention toward the flow of one's breath or the sensations in an area of their body for which they feel tense. - Mindfulness meditation: A mindfulness meditation involves finding a comfortable seat and paying attention to one's breath. The goal is to notice when and where the mind wanders and redirect it back to ones breathing. - Spiritual meditation: A spiritual meditation is a meditation that focuses on a connection between the person meditating and a higher being, entity, or universe, depending on one's belief system. How Meditation Helps With Panic Attacks As a panic attack occurs, the body and mind become dysregulated. When the person experiencing a panic attack uses meditation to ground themselves, their practice starts to counteract the \"alert\" messages in their brain. This will result in their heart rate slowing, their chest relaxing, and they will be more able to process their surroundings. Meditation is not guaranteed to stop a panic attack in its tracks. However, it can help to reduce the impact and length of the panic attacks while improving one's ability to cope with the physical symptoms. 10 Types of Meditation for Panic Attacks There are a number of different meditations for panic attacks. Certain meditation exercises may work better for you than others. It is also possible that a specific meditation practice may not work at all. It is suggested to practice each type a few times while in a neutral or calm state before practicing in the midst of a panic attack. Here are ten effective meditations for panic attacks: 1. Breathing Meditation A breathing meditation or [mindful breathing](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/mindful-breathing/) is focused on our breath. You start by finding a comfortable seated or lying position. Closing your eyes or downcasting your gaze and bringing awareness to your natural inhale and exhale. After a few moments, you begin to deepen that inhale and exhale on a 3 or 4 count, whichever feels most comfortable. For example, inhale 1-2-3-4 and exhale 4-3-2-1. Repeat this process as long as you need until you feel calm and relaxed or that any physical symptoms of a panic attack have passed. Once you start to notice the calming of your body, you can start to allow your breath to go back to its natural inhale and exhale. Slowly open your eyes and lift your gaze. 2. Grounding Meditation A grounding meditation is a guided meditation meant to literally ground you in the moment of a panic attack. In the midst of a panic attack, you start by focusing on your feet, whether sitting or standing. Your eyes can be open or downcast, although it is easier to notice the grounding sensation with closed eyes. Acknowledge that your feet are firmly planted on the ground. Feel free to say it out loud if you need to, \"My feet are firmly planted on the ground\". Next, move toward a solid object you can touch with your hands, a desk, a wall, or the side of a chair. Acknowledge that this object can support your touch upon its surface. Again, saying it out loud if needed, \"This [insert object here] can support my touch upon its surface.\" Alternate these conscious thoughts as long as you need. 3. Mindfulness Meditation A mindfulness meditation is a meditative practice that brings awareness and understanding to thoughts that come into our minds and, subsequently, lets them go. You start either sitting or lying down. Ensure your back is supported if seated. Bring awareness to your breath as you would in a mindful breathing exercise. Next, when a thought comes into your mind, as it will, do not try to stop them. Breathe them in, acknowledge why this thought came to mind, and breathe them out to let them go. For example, if a thought about a to-do list comes into your mind, you can acknowledge that this is likely due to the pressures of time and feel you do not have enough of it. When having a panic attack, thoughts may flood your mind, allow them, and do not push yourself to reconcile each one. Breathe them in and let them go on your exhale. 4. Walking Meditation A [walking meditation](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/walking-meditation/) is a guided and intentional practice. You start by finding a spot in your home, yard, local park, or sidewalk where you can easily turn around when needed. As you begin to walk, notice your feet as they move across the ground. How do they feel? Is there tension? Sense each step fully. Then begin to notice the rest of your body. Again, scanning for any tension. If any tension arises, acknowledge it and attempt to release the muscle, whether by tensing and then releasing or simply allowing it to soften. Then begin to turn your attention to your surroundings. What do you see? What colors are present? Is there something that most catches your eye? Describe it to yourself. What do you smell? Describe it to yourself. Are there any memories you associate with it? What do you hear? Again, describe it and notice any memories or thoughts that arise as you do so. Once you've completed this through, turn around and begin the process again. Repeat as needed. 5. Loving Kindness Meditation A loving-kindness meditation is centered around giving loving kindness to yourself, those you love, those you are indifferent, and those for whom you have a tenuous relationship. This is not a meditation of forgiveness, it is a meditation of offering our love and support to others and ourselves. Start in a comfortable seated, standing, or lying position. Close or downcast your eyes. Bring awareness to your body. Notice any tension and offer love and kindness to this area of your body for which you feel the strain. Say aloud: I honor you in the way I hope you honor me; I see you in the way I hope you see me. Move to envisioning a person with whom you love. Hold their image in your mind's eye. Say aloud: I honor you in the way I hope you honor me; I see you in the way I hope you see me. Then come to a person with whom you have an indifferent relationship with. Perhaps the guy behind the deli counter when you get your cup of coffee. Or the bank teller you see when you make a deposit. Say aloud: I honor you in the way I hope you honor me; I see you in the way I hope you see me. Now, this last one can be difficult. Begin to envision a person with whom you have tension and strain. Acknowledge the pain they have caused. You do not have to be okay with what they have done, you are only asked to honor their humanity in the way they should have honored yours: Say aloud: I honor you in the way I hope you honor me; I see you in the way I hope you see me. Return your attention back to your body and your whole self. Take a deep breath in 1-2-3-4, exhale 4-3-2-1. Say aloud: I honor you in the way I hope you honor me; I see you in the way I hope you see me. 6. Mantra Meditation A mantra meditation takes a sentiment for which you wish to believe about yourself. For example, \"I can do hard things.\" Once you've identified the mantra for which you would like to practice. Find a comfortable seated, standing, or lying down posture; ensure your back is supported if sitting. Begin by closing or downcasting your eyes. Notice your breathing, and acknowledge any areas of tension or holding. Breathe into any areas on an inhale 1-2-3-4, and let it go 4-3-2-1. State your mantra to yourself, aloud or in your mind, \"I can do hard things.\" Continue repeating for as long or as little as you wish. 7. Visualization Meditation A visualization meditation is where you visualize yourself in a place that feels safe and/or comforting. You can return to a happy memory with someone you love or in a place you wish to be. For example, you can visualize yourself on the beach you went to on a childhood vacation, with the sand beneath your toes. Wherever you see yourself, let yourself feel the sensations of the memory or place you visualize yourself in. Notice the colors, and imagine the wind on your face. Stay in this place for a few moments and/or until you feel more at ease. 8. Reflective Meditation A reflective meditation is where you put your mind to exploring a new thought and concept or looking back on something you have previously experienced. This type of meditation is also known as contemplative meditation. It is important to note that this meditation is a focused meditation on something particular. Therefore, if your mind wanders, acknowledge it and move your mind back to the reflection at hand. To begin, find a comfortable seated position with your back support and your eyes closed or downcast. Set the intention of your reflection for the mediation. For example, \"I will reflect on my last relationship and the red flags.\" Then proceed to put yourself into a space you can visualize a room or familial area. Allow the thoughts and images of your reflection to proceed naturally, bringing yourself back mentally if your mind begins to wander. At times these practices can be triggering, so it is good to pair them with the grounding technique we discussed above. 9. Movement Meditation Movement meditation is done with various forms of movement in our body. This type of meditation is often done in yoga. However, it can also be experienced through dance, running, or even simply raising our arms above our heads and then lowering them to our sides repeatedly. During the movement, the meditative aspect is the connection between your movement, your breath, and your mind's noticing of your body and the sensations you feel throughout. If discomfort is present, do not try to block it out, breathe and move through it without judgment. 10. Sound Meditation Sound meditation is where a specific sound, whether it be a consistent hum of rainfall or an instrumental song, is played throughout the meditative practice. The idea is to allow the sound to penetrate your mind and body. Feeling the vibrations throughout your body and noticing where your mind goes. Similarly to mindful meditation, we acknowledge our minds wandering and bring ourselves back to the sound. How to Begin Practicing Meditation for Panic Attacks Beginning a meditative practice can feel intimidating. Please start with a few minutes at a time, setting a timer for yourself as you embark on your journey. Beginning with one minute even and progressing from there is a helpful way to ease yourself into this practice. Alternative Treatment Options for Panic Attacks Meditation can help people prevent and calm a panic attack, however, if panic attacks are interfering with daily functioning, it may be time to consider other [treatment for panic disorder](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/panic-disorder-treatment/) options. These options can range from therapeutic interventions to medication. It has been found that a combination of therapy and medication is often most effective when treating anxiety and panic disorder.4 Treatment options for panic attacks include: - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): [CBT for panic disorder](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/cbt-for-panic-disorder/)works to target the reaction to phobia-related triggers of panic as well as associated thoughts and feelings. When there is no identifiable trigger, CBT can target the specific experience and reactions to the panic attack as it occurs, such as implementing a plan for meditation or soothing exercise. - Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT): [DBT](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/dialectical-behavior-therapy/)has been found to be increasingly effective in treating anxiety and panic symptoms by enhancing a person's executive functioning skills through its various tenets.5 - Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR): EMDR is an empirically based therapy that has supported persons with trauma for decades. Over time, [EMDR has grown to include anxiety and panic-related symptoms](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/emdr-for-anxiety/)as areas for which it can target through eye movements and/or tapping. - Exposure Therapy: [Exposure therapy](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/exposure-therapy/)involves exposing a person to whatever triggers a panic attack or the sensations experienced during a panic attack, whether in one's imagination or real-time. Over time, consistent exposure often leads to the extinction of previous symptoms as you are repeatedly shown your ability to survive. - Anxiety Medication: A psychiatrist may recommend [anxiety medication](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/medication-for-anxiety/)when panic attacks have continued at the same rate, frequency, and level of intensity over a period of time with minimal improvement. Where to Find Professional Help When [choosing a therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/how-to-choose-a-therapist/) for help with panic attacks, it is important to ensure you find a person with whom you feel comfortable. You can consider seeking guidance from your primary care doctor, a religious leader, or through your local communities resources. [Online therapy options](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/best-online-therapy/) and using an [online therapist directory](https://directory.choosingtherapy.com/) can connect you with therapists who specialize in panic attacks in your local area. Almost all insurance have dedicated phone lines and search options to find in-network providers as well. In My Experience Panic attacks are one of the most painful mental health conditions to endure. In my experience, regular meditation practice as a preventive measure to panic attacks is incredibly helpful. Professional support is highly recommended, and I also feel it is important that you take care in finding the support that you feel is best for you. I can never guarantee that panic attacks will ever fully \"go away,\" and I am very transparent about this with my clients. However, with support, dedication to oneself, and an open mind, panic attacks can and often will improve. I specifically and always encourage an open mind with any person entering my care, as therapy is a journey, and it can be that much \"easier\" to experience when we let ourselves experience it fully.
