However, not everyone isbenefiting from this digital revolution. A recent Eurostat survey on the 25Member States has shown a significantdivide between the 'haves' and the 'have-nots'. Young people are much more likelyto use the Internet than people over 55.Those of us who don't have a job, live ina rural area and have no child in thehousehold are less likely to use theInternet. Big differences were alsoreported between countries: whileInternet use is common in Scandinavia,Germany, the Netherlands and the UK, itis used far less in many of the newMember States. In the EU candidatecountries, Internet use is very low.Inadequate telecommunication infra-structures, limited computer skills, eco-nomic factors and language all play a rolein sustaining this digital divide. In 2004 the European Commissionadopted an action plan on how informa-tion and communication technologiescan be used to deliver better qualityKathy Redmond EDITOR health care to European citizens. The\"e-Health action plan\" covers everythingfrom electronic prescriptions and com-puterised health records to using newsystems and services that cut down wait-ing times and reduce errors.As part of this plan the Commission isdeveloping an EU health portal that willprovide a single point of access to publichealth and health-related informationproduced by the EU and its agencies.It was scheduled to be launched in 2005,but the site has not yet gone live. Anod to those of us not yet online wasmade in a commitment to 'monitoractions taken by Member States to makehealth information as accessible aspossible'.The importance of extending Internetaccess was recognised in March bythe UN General Assembly, when itendorsed the 'Tunis commitment',adopted by the World Summit on theInformation Society at the end of lastyear (www.itu.int/wsis). Hopefully, this commitment, to whichthe world's governments have now signedup, will stimulate European governmentsto step up efforts at European, nationaland local levels, to enable all Europeanpatients, particularly those living in coun-tries with limited resources, to benefitfrom the digital revolution.Getting serious about e-qual @ccess All correspondence should be sent to the Editor at editor@esoncology.orgCoverStory Laura van 't Veer: the person behind personalised treatments Our new-found ability to profile the gene expression of a tumour is transforming the way we characterise cancers and decide on treatment. Laura van 't Veer was there from the start, andshe's now splitting her time between the academic and biotech sector, driving the translationof the new technique into diagnostic tools not just for research but for everyday clinical use. When Laura van 't Veer was asked to apply for a job in thepathology department at theNetherlands Cancer Institute(NKI) in Amsterdam back in 1993, research colleagues warned her off, sayingthat diagnostics was rather a boring area to workin. What they did not appreciate - unlike themore far-sighted institute management - wasthat the post involved setting up a brand newsubdivision in the NKI's hospital, namely molec-ular pathology, which is now among the hottestareas of cancer research, with excellentprospects for a wave of new diagnostic - andprognostic - tools that should hit clinics world-wide in the next few years. Van 't Veer's own work as head of molecular pathology at the NKI has led to the rapid devel-opment of a microarray gene expression profilingtechnique for breast cancer that has propelledher onto the world cancer stage. She is now alsochief operating officer of Agendia, a biotechcompany jointly set up by the NKI and venturecapital funds, which has been the first firm toMarc Beishon 6CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006launch a commercial implementation of thetechnique, called MammaPrint. Since she andcolleagues authored a letter to Nature in 2002, explaining how the gene expression profile couldlargely eliminate unnecessary and possiblyharmful treatment for women at low risk of dis-ease spread, she's barely stood still as commer-cial interests have weighed in with offers - andthe 'competition' with critiques of the results. \"When people realised that it could change their way of clinical practice they tried to findholes in it - some got very worried and over-reacted,\" says van 't Veer. \"That is fine for me -it means we are on to something very promisingas they wouldn't pay so much attention to it other-wise.\" In fact, she adds, there could be as manyas 200 papers already published that use hergroup's data - \"And we've always been honestand fully described the possible pitfalls.\" In any case, she points out, reproducing results with independent cohorts wasalways going to take time, and indeed morepapers that build on the findings are due outthis year. Further, the microarray technique is aCoverStory CANCER WORLD 2006 informatics, biostatistics and oncology - atpresent it simply is not feasible for any labora-tory to achieve reproducible results usinghome-grown equipment. \"That is why Agendiawas set up - to create a 'black box' system thatcan be widely used for breast and other can-cers,\" says van 't Veer. \"My driving force for bringing it forward is that it is really of benefit to implement this typeof diagnostic - it will give a better insight intothe disease someone has, and insight into best therapy - so it's important that everyonestarts using it. But sometimes I feel I'm pushing too hard.\" Although her eye is now firmly on this clin- ical setting, van 't Veer's background is in basicresearch, and it was the scope of the job offer atthe NKI that has been a key enabler. \"I was thefirst molecular biologist to be appointed to workin both the hospital and the research part of theNKI,\" she says. \"Few people have appointmentsin both.\" The dual role has been especially ben-eficial as not only has she been able to proceedwith both diagnostic and research-based molec-ular pathology, but she also moved quickly to ELIGIO PAONI / CONTRASTO \"When people realised that it could change their way of clinical practice they tried to find holes in it\"CoverStory 8CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006establish a family cancer clinic to help and gath- er data on those with hereditary disease. So there could hardly be a better place to work for someone whose primary interest atschool was biology - and in particular DNA andgenes. At high school in the 1970s, her biologyteacher was a ready source of such information,and when van 't Veer went to university to studybiology she thought at first that embryology wouldbe her speciality, until by chance she met the wifeof a colleague who worked at the NKI, who askedif she would like to do a placement there. This proved to be a fruitful route during her undergraduate and masters years, as she firstcarried out work on DNA repair and thenworked with Roeland Nusse (now at Stanford)on a human homologue of a mouse gene - \"Thiswent very quickly - in a couple of weeks I hadidentified the gene, which was really spectacu-lar.\" She ended up working for a year with Nusseand majoring in molecular oncology, and waspresent at the founding stages of the science.\"When I cloned this human homologue involvedin mouse breast cancer, I also started to seewhether we could find alterations in genes inhuman tumours, which was quite new then. I can remember reading Robert Weinberg'spaper on the activated Rasoncogene in a human bladder cancer cell line, which was really very new. It's amazing progress that in 20 years I'vemoved from working in laboratory research onhuman oncogenes, as we called them then, toworking with patients.\" Van 't Veer moved on to take a PhD at the University of Leiden, completing an educationthat took some 13 years, which she followed upwith two years in Boston. Although recognising that it is not necessary to go to the US to gain post-doc research expe-rience, van 't Veer reckons that it is just asimportant to experience a change in culturalattitudes to research and life in general thatAmerica can bring to young scientists and prac-titioners. \"I enjoyed it greatly and of course thereare just so many people in Boston working inmolecular and cell biology and oncologyresearch that there is critical mass that justspeeds things up.\" She was fortunate to join a group of five young principal investigators at a new cancer The gene pool. On holiday with her family inSchiermonnikoog,an island off the north coast of the NetherlandsCoverStory CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006 9centre at Harvard Medical School, including Ren\u00e9 Bernards, a Dutch countryman who isnow a close colleague at the NKI and Agendia,and Stephen Friend, who went on to co-foundRosetta Inpharmatics (now part of Merck andco. Inc), set up in 1996 to develop the micro-array gene expression technology that van 't Veerwas later to use in her own work. \"This group generated a lot of excitement - they'd all come from big labs and were workingon experimental cancer biology, and I did themost basic research I've done, on cell cycle con-trol. But in Friend's group they found germlinemutations in the P53 gene that could help explain part of Li-Fraumeni syndrome [a rareautosomal dominant syndrome in whichpatients are predisposed to cancer]. The resultwas that several of us who returned to Europeand elsewhere from this group started familycancer clinics in the hospitals where we endedup working - because for the first time we couldsee that genes could explain hereditary cancersyndromes.\" So focused was this group, sheadds, that their computer database was dubbedthe 'candidate gene approach', thanks to thework on P53. Ren\u00e9 Bernards was then appointed a profes- sor at the NKI, and asked van 't Veer to join himas a fellow in the department of molecular car-cinogenesis. 'The post-doc time is when youhave the most freedom but you have to decide atsome point what you want to do,\" she says.\"I was very lucky - I didn't have to return homeand worry about writing proposals and applyingfor grants, which is a struggle for many whenthey look for work.\" Then a year later, the then NKI director, Piet Borst, led a brainstorm on where advanceswould be, and came up with the new molecularpathology post to further interest in translationalresearch. \"As I'd worked on gene characteristicsof human tumours in my PhD, it was of interestto me, and as a new job, it would be up to me to create the work programme. And as it alsoinvolved research I thought I'd be an idiot not totake it.\" Despite the rather negative image ofdiagnostics, she first had to beat off 50 otherapplicants for the post. She started with just two technicians, work- ing alongside 'conventional' pathologists, andbegan oncologists gavepresentations and we started language,\" she says. \"I explained what amutated BRCA 1 gene could mean to cancerrisk to our head of surgery - afterwards he toldme I was the first person he dared to ask whatpoint mutations are - there was no one else soclose he could directly ask.\" She did a similar knowledge exchange with Emiel Rutgers, head of the breast clinic (and acurrent close colleague in the microarrayresearch) - the NKI is a first-line centre forbreast treatment. \"I discovered what adjuvanttreatment was, and found that many womenwere asking them for advice. But they didn't dealwith the genetic side - it was not yet part of theirclinical practice. In any case, 12 years ago it wasonly haemato-pathologists treating leukaemiaand lymphoma who used the chromosomalbreak points as molecular diagnostics.\" Van 't Veer established a family cancer clin- ic to provide advice and support on hereditarydisease, and notes that now everyone treatingcancer patients needs to know about genes indaily practice. She's stayed mainly with breastcancer for her work, thanks to the NKI's spe-cialism and because so many things happen firstwith this disease. Another branch of her work ismolecular epidemiology - a current large study,for example, is on gene-environment interac-tions in hereditary breast cancer. After five years, van 't Veer split her team into diagnostic and research groups, and worked \"In 20 years I've moved from working on human oncogenes, as we called them, to working with patients\"CoverStory 10 CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006standardised biobank back in 1983, and the particular microarrays used by the NKI are ableto profile gene expression in frozen tissue. Asbreast cancer patients have long been followedup at the institute, clinical outcomes were alsoknown. Van 't Veer found herself in the centre of a multidisciplinary team that took the initialquestion - predicting the risk of metastaticdisease - and after much mathematical analysisand discussion emerged with a translation intothe clinical setting - reducing unnecessarytreatment of women at low risk using a 70-gene'signature'. It has involved working withphysicists at Rosetta on the bioinformaticsmethodology, checking and refining the dataanalysis with a biostatistician at the NKI, andtalking with many research colleagues, and hasbeen a hugely enjoyable experience for van 'tVeer.* \"Reducing unnecessary treatment was one of two main discussion points we came up with- the other was that the profile actually showsyou very early on in the development of atumour that the programme for metastatic risk islaid down, or hard-wired.\" In a news item van 'tVeer co-authored for Nature in 2003, she refer- ences a paper published in the Lancet in 1889 that hypothesised this hard-wiring - a startlingconnection with medical history. \"The impact of both findings has surprised me, as has the ongoing work on the integrationof all the specialities. I never expected this smallgroup to go so far and that everyone would knowthe paper in Nature and I would have people coming up to me in meetings saying, 'Ah now wecan see you for real.'\" Van 't Veer has presented the gene profiling story many times now, and continues to do so -\"It's because people thought microarray technol-to gain ISO quality certification for DNA diagnos-tic work. \"While it's not obligatory we felt that indoing genetic tests for heredity cancers majordecisions were going to be made on a singleresult, so we made sure it was quality con-trolled.\" On the research side, she focused onsingle-gene, single effects - until the NKI, likemany other institutes, decided to start work withmicroarrays in the late 1990s. \"We had to decidewhether to wait until it was developed and buysomething, or start our own microarray facilityand build up experience, and we chose the lat-ter. I became involved together with otherpathologists because we had tumour series thatwould be very interesting to study using micro-arrays. But it was a big hurdle in the first yearsto produce microarrays to high standards. Therecan be a lot of variation in hybridisation betweenone array and another.\" There are several types of microarrays and applications apart from cancer (for a good primeron the subject, see www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/about/primer/microarrays.html). However, the geneexpression segment has become one of thebiggest application areas, and already representsa market approaching a billion dollars. Van 't Veerand colleagues - including Marc van de Vijver,co-author on many papers - realised that one ofthe main planks in making progress is the pro-duction of reliable microarrays, where the privatesector had a role, and it was Bernards who usedhis contacts with Rosetta Inpharmatics to start acollaboration that led to the breast cancer geneexpression profile. \"Rosetta had the microarrays and analysis expertise, but we came up with the clinicalquestion and the patient information,\" explainsvan 't Veer. The NKI is one of the few centreswith a large bank of frozen breast cancer tissue,thanks to a far-sighted pathologist who started a\"Reducing unnecessary treatment was one of two main discussion points we came up with\" *For more on gene expression profiling and breast cancer, see Nature 415:530-536 and Journal of Clinical Oncology 23:1631-1635CoverStory CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006 11ogy would bring advances never seen before and it shows that all the billions of dollars invested inuniversities and institutes can make fastprogress.\" The NKI, she says, soon realised it could not attract funding to take the 70-gene test(MammaPrint) and other research to market,and decided to set up a spin-off company, name-ly Agendia, with van 't Veer and Bernards as twoof the directors. The company has grown rapid-ly and now numbers over 30 employees (andmuch credit must go to a commercial directorpoached from British biotech giant, Amersham).The major investors are Europe-based, whilesome funding arrives via the European UnionFramework programme. Although a bit hesitantat taking the plunge into commercial life, van 'tVeer feels that such start-ups are critical forrapid realisation of the results of translational research, commenting that larger companies arenot as fleet of foot when it comes to innovation.\"This type of academic spin-off is common inthe US but not so much in Europe,\" she notes. Further, she says that having been at the centre of the profiling research, she felt aresponsibility to continue to play a key role, notleast to drive the quality and robustness of theuse of microarrays and DNA diagnostics, and tobenefit NKI by collaborating in trials. There has,however, been a steep learning curve in dealingwith the venture capital community and alsowith regulatory processes, while there have beenquite a few criticisms levelled at the work. Sheand colleagues have had to fend off accusationsof conflict of interest between the NKI andAgendia, for example. The NKI soon realised it could not attract funding to take the 70-gene test and other research to market ELIGIO PAONI / CONTRASTOCoverStory 12 CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006\"But as we look at more complicated diagnostics and targeted therapies, such as the EGF recep-tor drugs, it's hard to do the development quick-ly,\" she says. \"Small companies have a role toplay in being close to academic centres andmoving things out into the commercial setting.\" Agendia now buys in custom microarrays from Agilent (to which Rosetta had sold its tech-nology) and is both a fully commercial supplierof MammaPrint and other products, and a clin-ical trials collaborator with the NKI and otherresearch organisations. Trials involving the 70-gene signature include a 500-patient cohortstarted in 2004 in the Netherlands, where thetest result is given in addition to other informa-tion on risk of recurrence. \"What we are evalu-ating here is what patients and doctors do withthe information,\" says van 't Veer. Another trialis the major European Union-sponsoredMINDACT (Microarray for Node Negative Disease may Avoid Chemotherapy) prospectiveproject, run by the EORTC (EuropeanOrganisation for Research and Treatment ofCancer) and TRANSBIG, the translationalresearch network of the Breast InternationalGroup (see also Cancer World 7). Other critics have felt that gene expression signatures such as the Amsterdam one are beingrushed out too quickly, are over-optimistic, and donot pass methodological 'litmus tests'. One recentpaper asks, for example, whether a doctor wouldbe \"prepared to withhold adjuvant chemotherapyin a young patient with a node-negative, HER2-positive breast cancer and a good-prognosis sig-nature\". Van 't Veer and colleagues, such asMartine Piccart, founder of TRANSBIG, reportthat independent validation of the Amsterdamsignature is more than good enough to proceedwith prospective clinical trials, while recognisingthat refinements and new signatures are bound toarrive sooner rather than later. Van 't Veer adds that a group in Rotterdam has come up with near identical results using adifferent microarray platform, and that differentmathematical techniques used have all beenfound to point at the same tumour subgroups,i.e. low- and high-risk groups. \"As we have moretumours analysed we will be able to have moresubgroups. I do realise the 70-gene signaturecan be improved - but to do that we need to dotrials such as MINDACT.\" Outside of trials, van 't Veer says that \"tech- nically the profile can be used now in clinicalpractice - with Agendia we have shown you cancarry out robust and reliable testing usingmicroarrays. But it's not that simple. The sameperson who set up the ISO certified lab at theDNA diagnostics department at NKI has movedto Agendia to set up a similar approved lab - butthere are still only a handful of such laboratoriesin the world that can do microarray work to thisstandard.\" That of course is where the 'black box'system comes in. Colorectal cancer will be thenext tumour type to benefit from this type of pro-filing, she says, noting that leukaemia already hasa number of tests available, albeit for a muchsmaller patient population. The rapid availability of the Agendia test has Private profile. Van 't Veerwith Ren\u00e9 BernardsCoverStory CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006 13taken some by surprise, it seems. While the com- pany has approval to run MammaPrint in Europe,they are waiting to see whether additional approvalby the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) willbe required before it - and other such tests - canbe used in the US. Agendia, which has a US part-ner (the Molecular Profiling Institute) forMammaPrint, received a letter from the FDA lastyear expressing concern that the test may requireclearance as a diagnostic device. Presenting a unit-ed front, van 't Veer and a representative fromAgendia's main competitor - US firm GenomicHealth, which is actively marketing its OncotypeDX breast cancer test - shared a platform at therecent American Association of Cancer Researchconference, and she says that discussions with theFDA are planned. Some pharmaceutical companies, mean- while, initially gave the test a lukewarm recep-tion, according to van 't Veer, as the techniquecould potentially cut the market for their 'block-buster' drugs. \"But they are realising thathealthcare systems just cannot pay for expensivetreatments such as Herceptin for everyone,\" shesays. \"We need to come up with more moleculartests that show who will benefit from thesedrugs - and the FDA is thinking along theselines for its approval process.\" Oncologists inprivate practice, who, in some countries, arepaid per course of chemotherapy, will also beaffected by new genomic approaches. Outside of her immediate work, van 't Veer is involved with wider healthcare issues in theNetherlands - she's a member of the advisorycommittee to the Dutch Cancer Society, forwhich she's currently writing a paper on bio-markers. She is also a member of the scientificresearch council of the Dutch Ministry ofHealth, where she is helping to set the agendafor biotech research over the next 10 years. As a woman, van 't Veer has been more con- scious of her gender during her time in the basicscience community, which she says is far more male dominated than clinical research. But as arole model, she reckons that some women areput off by the sheer amount of work she does.Recognition outside of oncology came last year,in Oprah Winfrey's magazine, of all places,which included her and Martine Piccart in afeature on 'the five biggest health breakthroughsby women scientists'. Beyond her personal achievement, this level of public interest says a lot about how thestatus of molecular pathology has grown sincevan 't Veer decided to go for that job at the NKI.Once very much a poor relation among oncolo-gy disciplines, it is now leading the way into thenew era of personalised therapies. And with aEurope-wide shortage of molecular patholo-gists, and pathologists in general, it is surely atempting career option for any young oncologistwith the determination to navigate themselvesinto a specialty that is too young, as yet, to haveestablished pathways. Van 't Veer reckons she's a fairly forceful character, but not aggressively so, and the reali-ties of running a commercial enterprise havecertainly been an eye opener. A good clue,though, to her drive for success lies in one of hermain hobbies - she's been a competitive rowersince her teenage years. Another big interest iscontemporary classical music. Presently, the working arrangement she has with the NKI is to do four days a week for theinstitute and just one at Agendia. A decision pointis bound to come soon as to whether she will domore on the commercial side - she won't bedrawn though, \"I like doing both.\" But withAgendia put forward by the EU as one of themost successful biotech firms involved in theSixth Framework programme - and her desire tosee the gene signature tests widely used - in prac-tice, that nominal 'one day' is no doubt already alot more time in her overall working week. \"Colorectal cancer will be the next tumour type to benefit from this type of profiling\"Grand Round 16 CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006For the 2.9 million people in Europe who will bediagnosed with cancerduring the coming year,evidence-based guide- lines will recommend a treatmentprogramme that is likely to involvecomplex combinations of surgery,radiotherapy, systemic therapies andsupportive care. Getting that treatment pro- gramme right for each individualpatient, with their own specific diag-nosis and their own co-morbidities,needs and preferences, is beyond thepowers of any individual practitioner.It needs a multidisciplinary approachto care, in which a team composed ofall relevant medical and allied healthdisciplines work with one anotherand with the patient to diagnose,treat and manage the cancer. But while the principle of multi- disciplinary treatment is widelyaccepted, the vast majority of these 2.9 million patients will never havetheir cases considered by a group ofexperts in a multidisciplinary meet-ing. Many treatments will be sub-optimal, patients will feel poorly sup-ported and lives will be lost. Traditionally, most cancers were primarily the domain of the surgeon.Though radiotherapy has been usedto treat cancers for more than 110years, and medical oncology has beenused for the best part of the last cen-tury, these treatments were seen asalternatives or even as rivals. It was in the early 1970s that the value of adjuvant chemotherapy inbreast cancer became established.Gianni Bonadonna in Italy andBernie Fisher in the US recall battlesto convince the medical establish-ment (for which read \"surgeons\") ofthe value of routine chemotherapyfollowing surgery for breast cancer.They got their evidence through a meta-analysis of many trials,conducted by the Oxford EarlyBreast Cancer Collaborative Group,which marked the beginning oflarge-scale international cooperationon analysing clinical trials. Thisopened the way to the use of combi-nations of treatments in routine pri-mary management and to generalisethe multidisciplinary approach toother cancers, making possible manyof the improvements over the lastdecades. Breast cancer still leads the way, with a huge number of options com-bining surgical techniques withchemotherapy, hormone therapy andradiotherapy administered in varioussequences. However, other cancersare rapidly catching up. So whetherthe cancer is in the lung or the liver,whether it is a glioma or a myosarco-ma, the evidence shows - and the Anna WagstaffThe dream team: when will we make it a reality? Multidisciplinary teams provide the best quality cancer care, as specialists come together to discuss diagnoses and plan treatments. They raise standards, improvepatient experiences and save lives. Sadly, most of Europe's cancer patients neverhave the chance to feel their benefits.Grand Round guidelines stipulate - that the patient does best with careful selection ofsurgical, radiotherapy and systemictreatments. Recent decades have also brought a cultural change towards a far morepatient-centred approach to medicinein general, and cancer treatment inparticular. More attention now tendsto be paid to aspects of treatmentsuch as control of pain, fatigue, nau-sea and other symptoms, and supportin coping with the stress of a life-threatening disease, or in coming toterms with the potential loss of fertil-ity or living with a stoma. Greater caretends to be taken to help the patientplay a role in decisions to do withtheir treatment, which entails takingthe time and effort to provide themwith understandable information, and to listen to them. Branches of medicine dealing with these aspects of care, includingpsycho-oncology, and palliative care,have been steadily growing in most ofEurope over past decades, and insome countries specialist cancernurses have taken on an increasingrole in areas such as symptom man-agement and the provision of infor-mation. But there remains a majorproblem in integrating these aspectsinto the routine care of patients;many patients who could benefit arenot being referred to the specialistswho could help them. The multidisci-plinary approach overcomes thisproblem by involving all specialistswith a role to play in the patient's carefrom the point at which the decisionon the treatment programme is made. Unfortunately, most cancer serv- ices in Europe cannot deliver. Thecentres of excellence, prestigious cancer institutes, major universityhospitals that offer high-quality multi-disciplinary care, are exceptions. Themajority of Europe's patients are diag-nosed and treated by specialists whohave little training or practice in amultidisciplinary approach, and whowork within structures that discour-age or rule out multidisciplinary care. Patients with breast or ovarian cancers may be treated at gynaeco-logy clinics, where their doctor'sprimary training is in surgery, andwhere there are no specialist medicaloncologists, radiation facilities orsupportive care. In a similar way,many urology clinics routinely treatpatients with prostate cancer. In some countries, a large proportion of cancer patients aretreated at smaller general hospitals,some of which lack radiotherapy.They probably have one or twospecialist medical oncologists, but inmany cases they are not organ-basedspecialists, as recommended for bestquality care.SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY / GRAZIA NERIGrand Round Even in large, well-staffed, institu- tions, patients are shunted from onedepartment to the next, without everhaving their cases considered by agathering of specialist disciplines. Leading practitioners say that things are moving in the right direc-tion, but that change is slow andlargely confined to more prestigioussites. It seems that only the UK andFrance have strategies in place toensure that every cancer patient, nomatter where treated, has his or hertreatment planned and delivered by amultidisciplinary team (MDT). Bothcountries aim for 100% coveragewithin a few years. THE DREAM TEAM A multidisciplinary approach requi-res that new cases are discussed atthe point of diagnosis, in a setting inwhich all specialists who have a roleto play in diagnosis and care con-tribute towards a personalised, evi-dence-based care programme, takinginto account the patient's co-mor-bidities and preferences. Decisions should be efficiently recorded and communicated, so thatprofessionals understand their roleswhile the patient understands theplan and is clear about who is respon-sible for what. Each step should becoordinated and monitored to ensurethat information, scans etc. arepassed on quickly and efficiently tothe right people and that unnecessarydelays are avoided. Straightforward cases may be dis- cussed only briefly. Complex casesmay need to be reassessed by themultidisciplinary team to evaluatethe patient's response to treatment,and to agree on the next step. TEAM MEMBERS The precise make-up of a multidisci-plinary team varies according to the 18 CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006nary discussion if there are addition-al complications. \"You case; that would beimpossible,\" he says, \"unless you areat a teaching hospital, when the 'eas-ier' and more common cases mustalso be discussed.\" Mike Richards, the UK National Cancer Director, responsible foroverseeing the national cancer plan,says, \"My own preference would beto have every patient at least regis-tered at the meeting. Some can bediscussed in under a minute - 'Thisis a patient with a completelystraightforward breast cancer. I'vetalked to her. She wants breast con-serving therapy followed by x or y...Has anybody any concerns?'Everyone can say 'No that's fine' andyou move on. But the nurse specialistmay say, 'Are you aware that thepatient's husband has Alzheimer'sdisease, and it will be very difficultfor her to get to radiotherapy.' Thatdoesn't take very long, but everyonein the team is then aware.\" Christine Bara, director of the Department for Innovation andImproving the Quality of Care at theFrench National Cancer Institute,says that, under the national cancerplan, a similar practice is mandatorywithin the French system. \"All casesare registered. Straightforward casesthat require treatment with the stan-dard evidence-based protocol are sim-ply presented very fast. Only thosewho cannot be treated with a standardprotocol are really discussed. A stan-dardised form is completed for eachpatient, which is held by the cancernetwork.\" VIRTUAL OR REAL ? Variations also exist in the extent towhich the team is a physical entity ata single site, or is dispersed acrossdepartments in different wings of acancer and the setting. In addition to surgeon, medical oncologist and radi-ation oncologist, the presence ofhistopathologist and radiologist isgenerally as becausemanagement decisions depend onknowing details of tumour margins orlocation, or the exact proliferationindex. The inclusion of additional clini- cal staff may vary, case by case,according to the location of the can-cer, or to the culture and tradition ofthe particular health service. In theUK, clinical nurse specialists arecommonly included in multidiscipli-nary teams, whereas in France this isnot the case. Teams treating gastro-intestinal cancers may include gas-troenterologists and specialist stomanurses; teams treating breast cancermay involve reconstructive surgeons.Palliative care nurses and psycho-oncologists may be involved accord-ing to patient need. The extent of specialisation with- in the team will also vary. Surgeonsall over Europe are becomingincreasingly specialised to a particu-lar cancer, and often define the sub-specialisation of the team. Medicaloncologists or radiation oncologistsmay be involved in a number of mul-tidisciplinary teams dealing with twoor more different types of cancers.Specialists who are thin on theground have to spread themselvesacross multiple teams. PATIENT SELECTION Methods to select patients for dis-cussion also vary. Bengt Glimelius, amedical and radiation cancerteam in Uppsala University Hospital,Sweden, says that straightforwardcases are simply treated according toprotocol, and doctors only put apatient on the list for multidiscipli-CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006 19hospital or even across two or more institutions. In the latter instance,members travel to meetings or holdvideoconferences. A good example of a single-site team is the cancer centre at the CarlGustave Carus University Hospital inDresden, Germany. This centre wasset up three years ago on the initia-tive of the doctors from the hospital'ssurgical, medical and radiotherapydepartments who had worked closelytogether for many years, but whowanted to establish multidisciplinaryoutpatient clinics. Director Michael Baumann says that they felt that this ideal wouldonly flourish in a physical centre. \"Iam not a big believer in virtual cen-tres. Ours is a real centre. You can gothere, there is a door and inside youfind medical oncologists, radiation oncologists and surgeons, sitting inneighbouring rooms.\" Single-site arrangements also have clear advantages for patients,who have a single point of referencethroughout all their stages of treat-ment. However, such arrangementsmay not be feasible outside cancercentres, university hospitals or cen-tres of excellence. It might be undesirable, as well as financially and logistically impossi-ble, to restructure cancer servicesthroughout Europe, so that everypatient is treated by a specialist mul-tidisciplinary team located at a singlesite, rather than at organ-specialistclinics or smaller general hospitals. Individual practitioners and, by extension, multidisciplinary teamsneed to treat a minimum number of patients each year to keep their skillsup to scratch. This has been shownto be the case for surgeons, not onlyfor difficult procedures such as pan-creatic and oesophageal resections,but also for breast, colorectal andother cancers. There is growing evi-dence that this holds true for otherdisciplines. Requiring multidisciplinary teams to operate from a single sitewhile fulfilling minimum volumerequirements would result in patientswith less common cancers travellingenormous distances for treatment.This may be the best option for cer-tain cancers or types of treatment,but other treatments can be carriedout closer to home. A 'virtual' team may be the bestGrand Round \"Ours is a real centre... there is a door, and inside you find medical and radiation oncologists and surgeons\" Michael Baumann, radiation oncologist and director of the Dresden Cancer Centre in Germany. The Centre was set up three years ag o on the initiative of the surgeons and medical and radiation oncologists at the Dresden University Hospital, and provides an environment where they can work side by side. It has sparked great interest among other university hospitals, many of which have yet to adopt a multidisciplinary approa ch to treatment. Multidisciplinary working has come late to Germany; even in breast cancer the proportion of patients who have their treatment p lanned in a multidisciplinary team meeting is probably lower than 20% Grand Round option - particularly if it is supported to overcome obstacles of distanceand to function effectively. The alter-native is that team members travel tolocations closer to the patient. Thiscan work across small distances, withdoctors based at one site attendingteam meetings at another site once aweek. However, there is already evi-dence from many countries that find-ing time to attend multidisciplinarymeetings is putting pressure on hard-pressed team members. Adding inlong journeys would exacerbate thesituation. Clearly, there is no single solu- tion or blueprint. In both France andthe UK, the emphasis has been onfinding flexible, local solutions andallowing the system to evolve. Bara, of the French National Cancer Institute, says, \"These meet- 20 CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006ings are necessary, but they do taketime, and the geographical distribu-tion of doctors can be a problem.What we are trying to do, jointly withthe regional agencies and the cancernetworks, is to concentrate thesemeetings in fewer locations in orderto guarantee their medical represen-tativity.\" Providing videoconferencingfacilities and effective electroniccommunications systems is set toplay a key role in this. Jean-Pierre G\u00e9rard is director of the Antoine Lacassagne CancerCentre in Nice, one of 20 cancercentres around which the newregional cancer networks are organ-ised. He says the problem is particu-larly acute for radiation oncologists asthere are no more than 500-600 inFrance, and their involvement isneeded in the discussion of around80% of cancer patients. \"It is a ques- tion of time sharing and havingvideoconferencing, and also increasingthe number of these specialists,\" hesays. BETWEEN THEORY AND PRACTICE The logic of using MDTs to plan anddeliver multidisciplinary treatment isirrefutable. However, recent studieslooking at aspects of how teams func-tion in the UK have revealed strikinggaps between theory and practice. One study (Macaskill et al, Eur J Cancer , in press), found that medical oncologists were absent for some ofthe time in over half of all breastmeetings (55.9%). They did notattend at all in 41.2% of cases andattended for only some of the meet-ing in 14.7% of cases. Clinical oncol-ogists (radiotherapists), by contrast, More than half of the meetings take place over lunch time... many don't even provide lunch! Jean-Pierre G\u00e9rard, director of the Antoine Lacassagne Cancer Centre in Nice, France. The Centre is one of the 20 cancer centres around which France's cancer services have been organised for decades, and has a long history of multidisciplinary working. Under the French Cancer Pl an of 2003, all centres treating cancer, whether public or private, are required to work in a multidisciplinary way, if necessary by cooperating w ith one another. Around 50% of all French patients are currently treated in a multidisciplinary setting; the aim is to extend this to 95% of patients b y the end of 2007CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006 21were present for the whole meeting in 70% of cases, and surgeons in98.5% of cases. One probable reason for this was that only a quarter (28%) of thesemeetings were held in 'protectedtime' set aside for the purpose. Morethan half of the meetings took placeover lunch time, with a further quar-ter (26.5%) scheduled for breakfasttime and 6.6% in the Fallowfield, whose psycho- oncology team at Brighton andSussex Medical School has beenresearching the functioning ofMDTs, points out that many lunchtime meetings don't even providelunch! Breakfast and evening meet-ings can be particularly difficult forstaff with childcare responsibilities.Another problem is that medical andclinical oncologists often have tocover a number of teams, often at dif-ferent sites. In the Macaskill study, respon- dents were asked to choose from alist of suggested improvements to thesystem. Top of the list (72.8% ofrespondents) was more time toattend meetings or for them to beheld in a protected session. Similar problems were highlight- ed in a review of breast cancer serv-ices carried out by the ClinicalStandards Board in Scotland twoyears ago. Their report recommendedthat multidisciplinary meetingsshould be considered of equalimportance to clinics and operatingsessions, and should be included inindividual job plans. Finding a suitable venue can alsobe a problem. Fallowfield recalls one team meeting in a room so small thatsome members were left standing indoorway straining to hear what wassaid or see what was shown. Another team held meetings in a traditional lecture theatre with a toptable facing tiered rows of seats.Predictably, she says, seats at thetable with microphones were occu-pied by surgeon, radiologist andpathologist, while registrars andothers sat in the first row of seatswith breast specialist nursing staffrelegated to the back. \"Not only werethe nurses rarely invited to contributetheir opinion about patient care, buteven had they wished to, they proba-bly wouldn't have been heard. Onerecommendation we made was thatthe nurses should at least have a rov-ing microphone.\" The problem of unequal status must be tackled if every specialistdiscipline is to make its contribution.Fallowfield says, \"Most people havebeen brought up in an educationalsystem that makes it very difficult toget over hierarchical boundaries.Without training, it is very hard forpeople who have grown up in a worldwhere they make a decision andeverybody fits in around that, to oper-ate in a way that will optimally bene-fit patients and also be helpful to theteams.\" A recent study by her psycho- oncology research unit revealed thatteam members often have a poorawareness of the role their colleaguesplay in providing information to thepatient. All the clinical nurses report-ed that they regularly discussed phys- ical, functional, social and emotionalwellbeing with patients, yet few oftheir colleagues showed any aware-ness of this. Some issues were dis-cussed with the patient by severalteam members, while others - suchas clinical trials and family history -were recognised by only a few teammembers as their responsibility. Even amongst medical special- ists, working as a team andrespecting and valuing everyone'scontribution can be tricky. Baumannfrom the Dresden centre says, \"Oneof the things that helps a lot is thatthe leadership structure is on a rotat-ing system. At the moment I amdirector as a radiation oncologist, butit will rotate at some time to medicaloncology or surgery or any other spe-cialty in the cancer centre. It is not aradiotherapy structure, or a surgeons'structure, but something we carrytogether.\" Mike Richards, the UK National Cancer Director, identifies 'goodleadership' as one of two essentialelements for effective team work (theother being administrative support).He recommends \"an inclusive leaderwho will facilitate everybody to bepart of the team and to make acontribution.\" He says that the lastten years have been about setting upMDTs, and the next five \"should beabout making those teams workeffectively\". Though he admits thatmuch work needs to be done to workout how best to go about this,he mentions a two- to three-daytraining course that has been run for Grand Round Richards identifies good leadership as one of two essential elements for effective team workGrand Round colorectal teams as an interesting example. The course aimed to raise the technical skills of teams around thetechnique of meso-rectal excision, butRichards says it has proved to have avery helpful spin-off in bringing teamstogether. It offered teams the oppor-tunity to exchange ideas about howthey worked, which is something theywould never usually do. \"I went to one of the courses, and talked to the team. The surgeon said,'Now I really know how to do the pro-cedure properly. I thought I didbefore I went.' The radiologist said, 22 CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006'Now I understand why they want theMRI scan done in a particular way.'The pathologist said, 'Now I under-stand why they want me to report thecircumferential margins in a particu-lar way.' The nurse specialist said,'Now I understand how to explainthis operation to a patient.' And theyall said, 'It has been valuable timeworking together and we feel we allknow each other better and we willwork together better.' We are begin-ning to get feedback that teams aredoing things differently, so we areseeing an evolution. \"We never said people had to goon the CRC programme, but word of mouth has been very effective. Onceyou get the first ten teams saying,'That was very helpful,' then otherssay, 'Actually we want to do thesame.' We reckon that within the nextfew months almost all of the 186CRC teams in England will havebeen on that course.\" Richards believes this example could be followed for other cancers.\"I'm sufficiently impressed that Iwould like to encourage it for otherdisease areas.\" OILING THE MACHINE Another crucial area showing seriousgaps between theory and practice hasto do with the quality and complete-ness of information, and proceduresfor recording decisions and ensuringthey are implemented. A review of decisions taken by an upper gastrointestinal multidiscipli-nary team published earlier this year(Ann Oncol 17:457-460) found that in just over 15% of the cases, deci-sions were not implemented. Themost common reason was that infor-mation on the patient's co-morbidityhad not been available or had beengiven insufficient considerationduring the meeting. The reportrecommended that methods be stan-dardised to ensure the inclusion ofco-morbidity data in MDT meetings. The other main reason for deci- sions not being implemented waspatient preference. This raises com-plex issues. Is it feasible to find outabout patient preferences before amultidisciplinary team meeting con- The problem of unequal status must be tackled if every specialist discipline is to make its contribution In some European countries, oncology nurse specialists regularly discuss physical, functional, social and emotional wellbeing with patients. A multidisciplinary approach to treatment should ensurethat this sort of support is included as an integral part of every patient's care planSCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY / GRAZIA NERICANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006 23siders the options? The report gave an open verdict, saying simply thatthe matter warrants further research. Fallowfield identifies a problem in ensuring that every member of theteam is aware of decisions, and thatpatients receive a consistent mes-sage. During an MDT training ses-sion, a rectal cancer patient listenedwith dismay as a nurse explainedcolostomies - what they look like,how the patient should care for them.The patient had been told that therewas no need for a colostomy, becausethe MDT decided that sphincter-saving surgery would be safe, but thenurse had not been present at thatmeeting. MDTs must be well enough resourced to ensure that every meet-ing has access to a full set of infor-mation (patient files, scans and otherdiagnostic results), that every teammember knows which patients aredue to be discussed and where andwhen meetings are held, and thatdecisions are recorded and commu-nicated effectively. Getting the administrative side right was the second element identi-fied by Richards as vital for teams towork effectively. His view is endorsedby others in different countries anddifferent settings. Asked what singlemeasure would most improve theeffectiveness of thecolorectal team Sweden,says, \"To have more time and not tohave to do all those extra administra-tive tasks that fall on you. We needmore admin support.\" In Dresden, Baumann believes that funding for infrastructure was essen-tial in making multidisciplinary care areality. Without it, he says that man-agement of patients would have con-tinued to be driven by separatedepartments. His hospital struggledto find funds from existing depart-mental budgets. Baumann arguesthat allocating extra resources for theessential administrative staff is thesingle most useful thing authoritiescan do to encourage hospitals tomove towards multidisciplinary care. In France, the state allocates funding to all hospitals, clinics andcancer centres where cancer patientsare treated, whether they are in thepublic or private sector. Funding isspecifically for the establishment ofcancer coordinating committees -'the 3 Cs' - whose role is to supportthe delivery of care through specialistmultidisciplinary teams, which isbeing made mandatory under theFrench national cancer plan. Cancer coordinating committees are responsible not only for organisingmultidisciplinary meetings, recordingdecisions, and computerising patientinformation, but also for auditingtheir effectiveness through systemat-ic reporting of a range of activity andquality indicators, including patientoutcomes. In the UK, cancer services were already being provided within a singleinfrastructure - the National HealthService. The cancer plan requiredthat infrastructure to be reorganised. Richards says that the nature of administrative support for MDTs isdecided at local level. \"Some hospitals advertise for a separate post, whileothers may allocate the task of servic-ing MDTs to one of the nursing staff.Depending on the size of the teamand the throughput of patients, youmight be able to have a coordinatorwho covers more than one MDT.Alternatively, the person who coordi-nates team meetings might alsonavigate or track patients through thesystem, knowing where the patientsare and what is going on, and makingsure the CT scan comes back and isacted on, and the next appointment ismade and so on.\" Many teams function well, but Fallowfield has come across teamswith no additional support that arestruggling. The Macaskill study intobreast teams found that almost 6% ofMTD decisions were not recorded inpatient notes or on a special form.The study says that this raisesquestions about whether the decisionis truly available for patients and staffmembers who were not at themeeting. \"It also raises the questionof the relevance of the decisionsmade at the MDM where they arenot recorded.\" NO TURNING BACK While some studies have revealedimprovements from multidisciplinaryworking - including better diagnosticpractice, closer compliance withguidelines, a more consistent provisionof psychosocial support, a strongerinput from nurses, and improved careco-ordination - it places heavy pres-sure on team members' time and as yetGrand Round Extra resources for administrative staff will be key to encouraging a multidisciplinary approachGrand Round there is little robust evidence to show that it improves clinical outcomes.However, ask any of the practitionersin the UK or France who have beenobliged to start working in this wayand, despite grumblings and misgiv-ings, the principle is no longer in ques-tion and there is no mood to return toold ways. \"I say at virtually every talk I give, that I believe the most important stepwe have taken in the last 10 years isto move to MDT working, and Inever get anyone saying - Mike youare wrong about that,\" says Richards.\"I can assure you they can be vocalabout things that they don't like. Fora lot of people, it is a source of jobsatisfaction because you get a lot ofpeer support from your group andyou know you are doing the best youcan for the patient.\" In France, moves to extend MDTs to cover all cancer patientsstarted three years ago, and alreadythey are reporting around 50% cover-age, with the aim of reaching 100%by the end of 2007. Given the diverse 24 CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006nature of the institutions that have towork together - not least the mix ofprivate and public - some level offriction was to be expected. However,Bara of the National Cancer Institutesays the principle is now completelyaccepted, and emphasises the role ofthe regional networks in this success.\"Everybody is saying the same thing.'Multidisciplinary meetings are nec-essary and have a huge educationalvalue.'Any resistance now only comesfrom isolated persons. Doctors work-ing in cancer today say they can nolonger imagine working withoutrecourse to multidisciplinarity.\" Patients also appear to be giving the system the thumbs up. TheDresden Cancer Centre conductssystematic audits of patients, andBaumann says the feedback has beenvery positive. \"They understand thatwe need specialists. We don't wantgeneralists who think they can doeverything. And they understand thatfor this reason they have to move todifferent places - to go for surgery toa surgeon and for radiotherapy to theRT department. But they like to have this cancer centre as a joint structurethat they can always go back to - theyknow their whole treatment issteered by this structure.\" Surveys conducted in the UK in 2000 and 2004 show patient satisfac-tion increasing by 4 to 16 percentagepoints on issues ranging from, \"Givenwritten information at diagnosis\"(from 45% 79% Richards believes that theMDT approach is responsible for alarge part of this improvement. Multidisciplinary meetings also raise the overall quality of cancerservices, not just in individual cases.In effect they offer continual peerreview, making it easier to detect andcorrect practitioners who consistent-ly stray from best evidence-based Bengt Glimelius, medical and radiation oncologist in the colorectal cancer team at Uppsala University Hospital in Sweden. Glimel ius has conducted patient consultations jointly with the colorectal surgeon for the past 25 years. More recently a radiologist and often a pathol ogist have also been present. Though a large proportion of breast cancer patients are now treated in a multidisciplinary setting in Sweden, the figur e for colorectal cancers is closer to 40%, while for prostate, lung or gastric cancers, it is more like 10-20%. Multidisciplinary teams are likely to be in cluded in new quality indicators currently being drawn up for Sweden's hospitalsCANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006 25practice. They provide a superb setting for specialists to learn moreabout the contribution of other disci-plines in the care of their patients,and for younger practitioners to learnfrom more experienced hands. Glimelius says, \"It takes time to have 10 or 20 people sitting there.You listen to ten cases, and areinvolved directly in maybe only two.But listening to the others, andunderstanding why a decision wasmade in one direction or other, helpsyour future patients. I'm not surehow a health economics study couldput a value on that.\" Jean-Pierre G\u00e9rard does venture to put a figure on the impact onpatient outcome. \"It is usually saidthat if the best treatment was appliedto all patients, we would improve thecure rate by between 5% and 10%. InFrance we have 150,000 deaths fromcancer every year, which would bereduced by up to 15,000 if everybodygot the best treatment. I think half ofthis will be gained by MDTs.\" This, he says, will mainly come about through raising standards insmaller establishments - public andprivate - closer to the standardsfound in academic institutes. THE CARROT OR THE STICK ? Sadly, the consensus on the principleof MDTs among those who alreadywork in this way will not benefit mostof the 2.9 million Europeans who willbe diagnosed with cancer in the com-ing year. They need the principle tobe put into practice in every location. Richards says that he does notbelieve it would be possible to extend MDTs to all treatment centres in theUK without some form of nationalcancer plan. Bara agrees. The Frenchcancer plan has driven change, pro-vided the policies and the finance toimplement them and supported pilotschemes to get them right. \"That'show it has been possible to move soquickly, and I think that in 2007,MDTs will be one of the measures[of the national cancer plan] we willachieve successfully.\" But what works in one country may not in another. A working groupin Australia has offered a useful con-tribution to this debate. Rather thanmap out any particular organisationalsolution, they have drawn up a set of\"Principles of multidisciplinary care,\"(see Zorbas et al, Med J Aust which \"aim to accom-modate a variety of delivery modelsand to enable clinicians to apply themaccording to the geographical, socialand cultural context in which theywork.\" The principles emphasise theimportance of the team approach,good communication, access to thefull range of therapies, maintainingstandards of care, and involving thepatient in decision-making. Australia is a country of vast distances, where the closest specialistradiation oncology services for breastcancer patients living in the city ofDarwin, for instance, are located3,000 kilometres away, in Adelaide. IfAustralia can map out how to organisea national network of specialistMDTs, surely there is little excuse forfailure in any European country.That is not to say that this is an easy process. Former central and easternEuropean health systems may haveunified structures in common withthe UK National Health Service, butmany have an acute shortage ofpathologists, medical oncologists orradiation oncologists, constrainingmoves towards MDT working. Other European countries have no such single unified healthcareprovider. The French national cancerplan is interesting because it encom-passes public and private provisionwithin a single network. The MDTsat the Antoine Lacassagne Centre areopen to private clinics within theonc-Azur regional cancer network,says G\u00e9rard, and some private doc-tors do attend. Conversely, inCannes, public hospitals work withprivate radiotherapy clinics, becausethey have no facilities of their own. But while this public-private mix is typical of many European healthsystems, not all of them haveFrance's tradition of a strong centralstate. In Germany, responsibility forhealth is devolved to a regional leveland doctors retain a high level ofautonomy over how they organisetheir work. Baumann believes theyneed the carrot rather than the stick.He accepts that Germany has beenslow to take on board MDTs, andthat even among university hospitals,many are still not working in the newway. But he says there is a great inter-est in what they have done inDresden, and the most helpful thingwould be for resources to be allocat-ed to support the change. Grand Round There is a need to inject a sense of urgency among those who can influence Europe's cancer servicesGrand Round MEP Karin J\u00f6ns is a breast cancer survivor and the German representa-tive for the European Breast CancerCoalition advocacy group, EuropaDonna. She says the German health-care system is very fragmented andthere are few levers for effectingchange, no matter how strong theevidence base. Health policy isorganised in a federal way and is inthe hands of the 16 regional govern-ments (L\u00e4nder), but it is the doctors,together with the health insurances(there are no fewer than 55 of them),who hold the real power. She believes that, for Germany and other public healthcare systems,the way forward lies in a system ofreliable accreditation and re-accredi-tation for specialist units that offerdiagnosis and treatment that complywith specified quality criteria.Patients would then be able to makean informed choice about where to gofor the best quality treatment, andhospitals and clinics would have anincentive to raise their quality of care. This approach has been pio- neered by the European Society ofMastology (EUSOMA), which wantsto see all Europe's breast cancerpatients treated by multidisciplinaryteams of breast specialists withinaccredited breast units fulfillingstrict criteria on staffing of the med-ical team, treatment procedures andminimum case loads. J\u00f6ns played a key role in getting many of these criteria - particularlythe multidisciplinary approach -adopted by the European Parliamentas part of the European BreastCancer Resolution in 2003. Sincethen, she has been campaigning toget the recommendations imple-mented throughout Europe, focusingparticularly on her own country, butshe is not satisfied with the pace ofchange. 26 CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006Though the German Cancer Societyaccredits breast units, it has adoptedquality criteria that are far lessstringent than both the EUSOMAand the EU guidelines. J\u00f6ns says thathospitals are pooling patient numbersto show they treat a minimum of 150new cases a year, even though theyare not working together as anintegrated breast unit. Many so-called breast units, she says, have noin-house pathologists, and have to getthe pathology done at anotherhospital, and are therefore unable tocontrol the quality. Most don't havebreast nurses - or even know what abreast nurse should be. And whilethe EU guidelines call formultidisciplinary team discussionspre- and post-treatment in 100% ofcases, certification is being handedout in Germany to hospitals that can show 20% of patient cases areconsidered at some point by anMDT, so long as the hospitals give assurances they are movingtowards 40%. J\u00f6ns believes this provides win- dow dressing without a commitmentto real change. \"Most hospitals wantto get certified as a breast unit so thatthey get a better image. But oftenthey do not work in a serious multi-disciplinary way. Some doctors stillbelieve they know everything and cando as they please without referenceto any guidelines. They say 'We'vealways done it in this way, and in ourcountry everything is OK.'\" That everything is far from OK is evidenced by a report into breast can-cer operations compiled by theBundesgesch\u00e4ftsstelle Qualit\u00e4ts-sicherung. It found that in 622 of asample of 691 hospitals, surgical'security' margins were smaller thanevidence-based guidelines. J\u00f6nsbelieves that this is largely a diagnos-tic failure. \"In 50% of cases of breastcancer they only realise during sur- gery that it is cancer. If they had doneit in a multidisciplinary way and hadknown the diagnosis in advance, thenthe surgery would have been done inthe right way. Unfortunately thisis not the only problem with breastsurgery.\" Such monitoring can play an important role in combating compla-cency and convincing the medicalestablishment of the need forchange. The Swedish government isalso developing quality indicatorswhich county councils will be obligedto monitor. Glimelius expects MDTsto feature. \"It won't be a law, butthere will be the chance to checkwhether or not it has happened.\" Current and future cancer patients across Europe hope that acombination of national cancer plansand accreditation backed by EUguidelines and recommendations willdeliver top-quality multidisciplinarycare. But how long will it take? J\u00f6ns points out the EU adopted guidelines on breast cancer screening15 years ago, but this service will notbe available throughout Germanyuntil the end of 2007. Women inmany other EU countries will have towait even longer. There is a need to inject a sense of urgency among those who have aninfluence over the shape Europe'scancer services - the sense of urgencythat convinced Jacques Chirac andTony Blair to put some political cloutbehind their countries' respectivecancer plans. Currently 1.7 million European citizens die from cancer each year. IfG\u00e9rard at the Antoine LacassagneCancer Centre is right in estimatingthat MDT working could increase thecure rate by 2.5%-5%, that alone couldsave as many as 85,000 lives a year. AsG\u00e9rard himself put it, \"Not bad eh?\"DrugWatch 28 CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006Reaping the rewards of the new era of molecular biology isproving harder than many had anticipated. Just as the trickle of so-called targeted drugs is turning into asteady flow, each one more expensivethan the last, bureaucratic restric-tions on clinical trials compounded bya lack of public funding for researchare closing down opportunities to dis-cover how to use these new drugs togreatest effect. Not in France, however. Here the newly established National Institutefor Cancer, INCa, is set to launch itsfirst ever clinical trial. It will seek toclarify the optimal duration ofadjuvant Herceptin (trastuzumab)treatment. And in admirable contrastto the clinical trials directive, it isspecifically designed to encourage asmany French cancer treatmentcentres as possible to join in. Now,trial coordinator Xavier Pivot, fromthe Besan\u00e7on University Hospital, isinviting European researchers to jointhe project by setting up similar trialsin their own countries. The PHARE trial - Protocol of Herceptin Adjuvant with ReducedExposure - is based on the FrenchTemporary Treatment Protocol forHerceptin (www.enqueteinca.fr/medias/pttdefeng2710.pdf), which was drawn up under the auspices ofINCa to enable eligible patients toreceive adjuvant Herceptin pendingapproval by the European MedicinesAgency (EMEA). It is a non-inferioritytrial, with the main objective of estab-lishing whether treatment for 6months gives results that are no worsethan treatment for 12 months. Thereare two secondary objectives, saysPivot. One is to compare Herceptingiven sequentially to chemotherapy (asin the HERA trial, New Engl J Med 353:1659-1672), with Herceptingiven concomitantly with a taxane-based chemotherapy (as in the BCIRGtrial, www.bcirg.org). The second is tosee whether the optimal varies according to whetherthe is oestrogen-receptor posi-tive or negative (ER+ or ER-). Non-inferiority trials require a large number of patients and eventsin order to give statistically significantresults, and PHARE is looking torecruit 7000 patients over the nexttwo years. Given that only 1%-2% ofFrench cancer patients are currentlyenrolled in clinical trials, this is a veryambitious target. But for the oncolo-gists at INCa, this is the whole point.Much though they would like toknow the answer to the PHARE questions, they are equally interestedin simply extending the number ofcentres involved in clinical trials - anyclinical trials - because they believe,on the basis of strong evidence, thatcentres involved in trials provide bet-ter quality treatment. One of the targets INCa has set itself is to raise the proportion ofpatients in clinical trials to 10%. Inorder to help smaller hospitals andeven private practices to participate inthese trials, it has put together a teamof 'flying data managers' who can bedispatched to give support as and whennecessary. In addition to undertakingits own trials, like PHARE, INCa willalso give support to trials organised byother bodies - whether they be Frenchor international organisations such asthe European Organisation forResearch and Treatment of Cancer(EORTC) or the Breast InternationalGroup. Twenty-eight clinical studiesgroups have now been set up under theauspices of INCa - for lung, breast,colorectal, radiation therapy, etc - eachwith 10-12 experts who will select thetrials INCa will support and proposenew trials where they are needed. The key to making this work is to keep things simple. The PHARE trial Anna WagstaffPHARE: shining a light for academic research in Europe Clinical research activity may be plummeting in the rest of Europe, but in France they're determined to substantially increase the numbers of hospitals and patients involved in clinicaltrials - starting with a strategic trial on Herceptin.CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006 29DrugWatch was designed with an 'ultra-simple' protocol, which requires the sameamount of work as normal treatment.It uses an 'ultra-simple' Case ReportForm, and an 'ultra-simple' randomi-sation. All the documents will bedownloadable from INCa's website.Sources within INCa stress that it isstill possible to achieve this degree ofsimplicity at the level of the treatingphysician, even under the terms ofthe European clinical trials directive.This is because the additionalbureaucracy and expense involved incomplying with the directive falldirectly on INCa, as the sponsor, andINCa has the resources, staff andexperience to cope. Keeping things simple doesn't just help when it comes to wideningthe group of French treatment cen-tres involved in clinical trials. It alsomakes it easy for research groups in other countries to run similar trialswith a view to conducting meta-analy-ses that could further clarify the bestway to use adjuvant Herceptin. Pivotis very keen to see this happen,because he believes the results of thePHARE trial will simply open the wayto further questions that needanswering: \"My belief is that we havea subset of patients who requiremaybe 6 months, probably a subsetwho require less and probably a sub-set who require more.\" Working out which patients do best with which protocols will be acomplex business, and the moregroups who join the search, the better.\"It is a French project, but my belief isthat this project should not remain apurely French one, it should take on aEuropean dimension, and other coun-tries can participate in such a study or undertake similar studies, because itis a very simple one. \"If we have 5000 patients enrolled in France and 4000 in UKand 5000 in Germany and 4000 inItaly, we can be absolutely sure of theresults. And in terms of subset analy-sis, if we want to identify a differencebetween the concomitant versussequential administration or betweenER- and ER+ tumours, we will prob-ably need this type of meta-analysis,so a European dimension to such anapproach would be very effective.\" Whether or not research groups in other countries choose to take upthis invitation, there is no doubt thatfinding how to use cancer drugs moreeffectively will be key to ensuring thatEurope's patients can benefit fromthe very expensive new drugs that arecoming on the market. And as Pivotpoints out, pharmaceutical compa-nies are hardly going to volunteer todo studies like PHARE that mayresult in halving the period for whichtheir drug is used. \"There is an urgent need,\" he says, \"for more strategic, academic trials likePHARE\", and he hopes that similartrials will soon be up and running forother targeted drugs, such as Avastin(bevacizumab). France does not have an out- standing track-record on leading clin-ical trials, and those in Europe whohave been plugging away at this fordecades may be forgiven the odd wrycomment about the fervour of theconverted. That said, amidst thedespondency created by theEuropean directive and often chaoticway decisions are made over newdrugs - who gets them and how theyare used - the new \"can do\" approachof French oncologists in INCa willsurely be welcomed as a ray of hopeon the European scene.Master piece If the cardiologists can do it, so can we Michael Sporn believes the best bet for controlling cancer is to pick up the warning signs and nip it in the bud. A pot of gold awaits any drugs company that can come up with aLipitor for cancer, says Sporn, and easy-to-use biomarkers would already be on the markethad one-tenth of the research dollars poured into chemotherapy been invested in proteomics. From his fifth floor office at Dartmouth Medical School, in the bucolic town ofHanover, New Hampshire, Michael Sporn, the man who coined the term \"chemopre-vention,\" is still waging his own version of the waron cancer. That it is one largely devoid of researchdollars and ignored by pharmaceutical companieshas left him frustrated, but undaunted. There isno greater motivation for him to keep at it thanthe fact that many of his good friends and col-leagues have already died from carcinoma and, hesays, \"hundreds of thousands more like them areslipping through the back door every day.\" The answer, he believes, is not to be found in diet and lifestyle changes, the subjects that oftencome to mind when the word 'prevention' arises,and which are largely the focus of the USNational Cancer Institute's prevention pro-gramme. \"We're not going to fix this dietarily,\" saysSporn. \"Living well and eating well isn't going tomake cancer go away. Vitamin C has been a fail-ure. Vitamin D hasn't been much better, and low-fat diet hasn't worked either.\" Sporn's ideas, infact, are less about preventing the disease thanElizabeth DeVita-Raeburn 30 CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006identifying people at the early stages of malignantcell differentiation and nipping that process inthe bud with drugs. \"This is a nasty disease thatinvolves genetic dysfunction, and we need somereal medicine to deal with it,\" he says. His model is based on what cardiologists have done to reduce mortality from heart disease:identify people when they're first showing signs oftrouble - high blood pressure or cholesterol - andmedicate them before they're too sick to save. Hisfavourite graphic shows two simultaneous curves- one downward slope, indicating decreasedmortality from heart disease over the years, super-imposed upon a flat line reflecting the staticmortality from cancer. \"Lipitor is a classic chemo-preventive agent,\" says Sporn. \"Pfizer may notwant to call it that, but that's what it is.\" Granted, cancer is more complex than heart disease. Chemoprevention studies are prohibi-tively long and expensive; pharmaceutical compa-nies are averse to the risk of treating so-called'healthy' patients with any medication that mightcause lawsuit-worthy side-effects; and, perhapsmost challenging, there are as yet no easyMaster piece CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006 31biomarkers for cancer. \"You put someone on 20 mgs of Lipitor, measure their cholesterol thatday and then again in three months, and you cantell them their cholesterol and blood pressure aredown,\" says Sporn. Not so with cancer. Not, says Sporn, because it's impossible, but because little effort has been made. \"For all themolecular biology that has been done on cancer,there hasn't been much of a crash on biomark-ers,\" he says. \"The bottom line is that the dollarsare simply not there, even though chemopreven-tion would be more cost-effective. Meanwhile,we still have three hun- thousand usefullives year. out LanceArmstrong so much.Sometimes,\" he admits,\"my frustration of up at night.\" YorkCity, which he the general pushiness of it,\" says Sporn, wholived all over the city, and worked as a deliveryboy for a florist in his free time. College wasHarvard University, where pushiness took theform of grade competition. He didn't like thateither. It wasn't until the summer of his secondyear in college that he started to get a sense ofwhat he didlike. \"I went to Cornell and took a summer school class in comparative anatomywith an anatomist named Perry Gilbert,\" hesays. \"It was a formative experience.\" Gilbert, famous for his expertise in shark \"Living well and eating well isn't going to make cancer go away\" Master piece 32 CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006anatomy, had a reputation as a mentor to stu- dents. He kept a card on each one he taught overthe course of his career, complete with their pic-ture, exam scores and personal details. This was adifferent world to Sporn. \"When I was at Harvard,there was never any meaningful personal interac-tion between professors and students,\" he says.Gilbert, on the other hand, loved to be with hisstudents, and was known to roll up his sleevesand help them with dissections. \"He even tookthe class picnic,\" says experiencegave Sporn a life-long taste for congenial andidealistic research environments that would guideevery step of his career. Because of his experience with Gilbert, he turned down Harvard Medical School, opting,instead, for the University of Rochester, the firstmedical school to be founded after the FlexnerReport of 1910, which changed American medi-cine by creating a higher standard for modernmedical education and effectively closed two-thirds of the US medical schools. Rochester wasexactly what Sporn wanted. \"It was a very strong,very holistic, integrated place,\" says Sporn. \"Anda very nurturing one.\" Research was encouraged,but never allowed to become separate from reali-ty - the basic science part of the school was sep-arated from the hospital only by a set of doubledoors. Students and teachers, basic scientists andclinicians, shared a cafeteria. Nor was the school simply about producing doctors every four years. \"Somewhere along theline, various faculty members would tell you totake a year out and do research,\" says Sporn.When his turn came, he took 15 months out tostudy with the British psychiatrist and theoreti-cian Ross Ashby, one of the founding fathers ofcybernetics. \"He was totally uninterested in any-thing by way of the laboratory, but he let me dowhatever I wanted,\" says Sporn. \"So I wasexposed to a really world class theoretician andat the same time I was allowed to sow my wildoats in the lab. I was learning how to work in a laboratory and given total freedom to explorethings.\" He returned to Rochester \"totally bitten by this way of life.\" He finished his last two years ofmedical school, at which point two \"absolutelywonderful\" faculty members, John Romano andGeorge Engel, both professors of psychiatry andlong-time collaborators themselves, helped himand a friend of his get a $50,000 grant from theNational Institutes of Health (NIH) to set uptheir own lab and do basic research. He still can'tbelieve his luck. \"We had no preliminary data, nonothing. We were just a couple of bright kids witha dream of doing research.\" Together, he and hispartner did some of the first papers on amino acidmetabolism in the brain, showed that the braincan make its own urea, and did one of the firststudies on the biochemical basis of memory. When the money ran out, Romano and Engel helped Sporn and his lab partner get jobs asresearch associates at what was then the biggestresearch Mecca in the US - the NIH. In the US in the early '60s, if you wanted a research career, NIH was where you wanted tobe. The public, and the government, placed anenormous trust in the power of science, and themoney flowed freely. \"The sky was the limit,\" saysSporn, still marveling over it after all these years.\"Jim Shannon, the director, would go down toCongress and ask for money for something, andthey'd say, 'You're not asking for enough money, doctor, you need more.' There was no political interference, either. We might as well have beenliving in a magical land of Oz, divorced from theworld of politics.\" Like Rochester, the labs andthe wards of the NIH were separated only by ahallway, reinforcing the ideal of lab-to-bedsidemedicine, and the scientists were all part of onebig community. \"No one even knew what insti-tute anyone else was in.\" From 1960 to 1964, Sporn worked on the \"We were just a couple of bright kids with a dream of doing research\"nucleic acids of brain cells at the Neurology Institute. Though he had once imagined a careeras a general practitioner, those four years changedthat for good. \"If I had any thoughts of going backinto clinical medicine, they were gone,\" he says.When his four years were up, he decided hewanted to stay. The problem, by then, was thatVietnam had changed everything. Even youngdoctors who hadn't envisioned research careerswere competing for spots at the NIH because itwas part of the Public Health Service, and work-ing there meant you didn't have to go to war. THE CHALLENGE OF CANCER To make matters worse, there was a hiring freezeon. Sporn went to every institute director at theNIH in search of an opening, with no luck. \"Afreeze was a freeze,\" says Sporn. Then, one night,at a poker game, one of his co-workers overheardsomething about a new carcinogenesisprogramme the National Cancer Institute (NCI)had managed to set up on a contract basis. Andthey were hiring. He'd never given any serious thought to doing cancer research before. But hejumped at the opportunity, not only because heneeded the job, but because he'd started to feelan urge to do something more clinically applicable.\"I knew there was a big challenge in cancer,\" hesays. He knew because his wife, Kitte, a paedi- atric nurse at the NIH, took care of manycancer patients. Nightly, she regaled him withstories of children dying of leukaemia, beforethe era of platelets and supportive therapy, andpatients struggling to overcome \"kamikaze\" max-illofacial procedures and hemi-pelvectomies.\"Kitte took care of one patient without a face,\"he says. One Sunday morning, he'd met one ofher patients, a young, pale, girl named Debbie,who, he knew, would inevitably die. \"She waslike a poster child for everything the NIH wastrying to do,\" he says. This was 1964, two years after RachelMaster piece CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006 33Carson, a former marine biologist with the USFish and Wildlife Service, set off a publicfirestorm with Silent Spring , a book that argued that the pesticide DDT was killing fish andwildlife, and raised speculation that chemicals inthe environment might have a negative effect onthe human population, as well. The NCI was asinterested as anyone in sorting out the connectionbetween chemicals and cancer. As for Sporn, itwas no big leap, he says, to go from studying thenucleic acids of brain cells to studying the nucle-ic acids of rat cells that had been exposed to com-mon carcinogens like Azo dyes, such as butteryellow, or the chemical aflatoxin which is theproduct of a mold that often grows on spoiledgrain, and acetyl amino fluorine (AAF). \"The popular hypothesis back then was that chemical carcinogens caused cancer by binding \"The public, and the government, placed an enormous trust in science, and the money flowed freely\" Master piece 34 CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006to key protein targets,\" he says. \"We did some of the first studies that showed that chemicalcarcinogens would bind to DNA and causedysfunction.\" They also showed that the non-carcinogenic analogues of those chemicals didn't bind to DNA. \"The greater the carcinogenicity ofa substance, the higher the level of DNA bind-ing,\" says Sporn. Six years passed, and as intellectually excit- ing as the research was, it still didn't feel terriblyhelpful to the patients Kitte was caring for. \"Istarted thinking, where is this going,\" says,\"what does it mean?\" Then Umberto of the programme. had aresearch interest in vitamin A. He'd done ham-ster studies that showed that vitamin A couldsuppress carcinogenesis. He asked Sporn to lookinto vitamin A and lung cancer. Sporn knew littleabout either, but he started reading up, and dis-covered that vitamin A acts more like a hormonethan a vitamin. \"It controls the differentiation ofalmost all the epithelial tissues in the body,\" hesays. He was also stunned by another, earlier, dis-covery: the histology of tissues in rats with vita-min A deficiency resembled the histology of earlycarcinogenesis in humans. \"It got me really excited,\" says Sporn. If one could control or reverse early abnormal differ-entiation, vitamin A could be a true preventivetool at a very early stage. But there were twomajor problems: First, high doses of vitamin Acaused toxicity. And second, natural forms ofvitamin A didn't necessarily reach target tissues,such as the lungs, where one wanted to preventcancer. \"I got the idea to make synthetic ana-logues of vitamin A, for which we coined thenew term, 'retinoids',\" says Sporn. He set up acollaboration, first with Hoffmann-LaRocheand then with Johnson and Johnson, and alsoset up a new programme for chemists through-out the country to make new retinoids. \"Inthose days, there were no patents at the NIH and no MTAs [material transfer agreements,which allow one party to perform research usingthe materials of another party].\" They testedseveral hundred vitamin A analogues on wellover twenty thousand hamster tracheas. Itquickly became clear, he says, that a numberof the analogues could reverse the abnormaldifferentiation. EARLY RESULTS By 1976, they had their first animal data. \"Wecould take lesions in hamster tracheas thatresembled those of heavy smokers and reversethem,\" he says. Further work showed similar suc-cess in animal models with cancer of the bladder,oesophagus, colon and breast. \"We would screenan agent first in an organ culture system, and if itlooked really promising, then we'd do the prelim-inary animal experiment, and then we'd do full-blown carcinogenesis studies,\" he says. Some ofthe agents they worked with, including oneretinoid for clinical prevention of breast cancerthat was tested in Italy, got very good results. Andsome have even gone on to be widely used - butalmost always in the context of treatment, neverin chemoprevention. \"Drug companies are not very interested in this,\" says Sporn. \"They're terrified of liabilitysuits.\" It's an issue that frustrates him, he says,because, rationally speaking, he doesn't see thedifference between someone with high choles-terol, or blood pressure, and someone withsevere dysplasia (abnormal epithelial cells),seen on biopsy or in cytology smears. The lattergroup, he says, are no healthier than the former.But the concern is that the risk of dosing thisseemingly healthy group with chemopreventivedrugs might outweigh the benefit. Sporndoesn't think that's the case, and cites the out-standing success of tamoxifen and raloxifene inpreventing breast cancer as examples. \"ThoseHe can't see the difference between someone with high blood pressure and someone with severe dysplasiaMaster piece CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006 35drugs are old, we can do much better than that now,\" he says, but acknowledges that morework needs to be done to prove it and to devel-op even safer agents. \"We're not ready to putchemopreventive agents in the cornflakes yet.\" In 1995, Sporn decided to leave the NIH for Dartmouth, returning to a part of the coun-try he and his wife love. \"I have roots that goway back to this part of the world,\" he says. Hespent five summers away at camp there, arespite from the New York City he was nevercomfortable in. He and his wife spent theirhoneymoon at nearby Mount Washington, andthey used to take ski trips here with his twoboys, Tom and Paul, when they were kids. In1975, he and Kitte bought an old farmhouse outin the countryside, with an eye toward movingthere some day. But another reason for the move was also toget back to chemoprevention work, which he'd drifted from a bit in his last ten years at NIH,and do something \"totally off the wall.\" And bythat he means studying triterpenoids, a familyof mildly anticarcinogenic and anti-inflamma-tory chemicals that occur in a wide variety ofplants, including rosemary. Upon getting inter-ested in them, Sporn promptly did exactly whathe did with vitamin A - he asked a bunch ofchemists to make him as many analogues asthey could come up with. Although this time,he didn't have to ask drug companies andchemists across the country - he just had to goacross the street to Dartmouth's chemistrydepartment, where he asked Gordon Gribble, aprofessor of chemistry, and Tadashi Honda, anassociate professor, to come up with over 300derivatives. \"They're all home brewed,\" he says. One of the most exciting things to come out \"We're not ready to put chemopreventive agents in the cornflakes yet\" Master piece 36 CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006of the research thus far, he says, is the revela- tion that triterpenoids have multiple functions.They're apoptosis, are be useful for bothchemoprevention and chemotherapy,\" saysSporn. In fact, the US Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) has approved two ofthem for phase I trials in leukaemia and end-stage solid tumours, studies which are due tostart soon at MD Anderson, Dana Farber andpossibly the NIH. \"Nothing ever goes into pre-vention first,\" he sighs. AN ACT OF FAITH He does think the field will gravitate to his pointof view, eventually. Not that chemopreventionwill replace the other treatment modalities, butrather be the first step in approaching someoneat risk. \"It's something of an act of faith, but Ibelieve that essentially all the common forms ofepithelial cancer are preventable, if we can getat the solutions in the early states of abnormaldifferentiation and prevent progression,\" hesays. There are problems that need to be solvedfirst, of course. Drug companies need to shed their fear of liability, and see that cancer chemopreventiondrugs can be just as profitable for them as drugslike Lipitor, he says. To assuage them about lia-bility issues, Sporn envisions an insurance poolwhich could protect both corporations and indi-vidual physicians against specific liability, andwhich could be funded by a tiny surtax on pre-ventive drugs. Easy-to-use biomarkers, obtained from nothing more complicated than a blood sample, areneeded to make chemoprevention studies moreeconomically feasible. And the FDA needs to bepersuaded to let drug companies use them. \"If atenth of the budget that has been put intochemotherapy had been put into development ofproteomics I think we would have a blood test,\"he says. On the day that we last spoke, Sporn was, as he said himself, in a very optimistic mood. Heand his colleagues at Dartmouth had figured outa way to detect tiny amounts of tumour in ananaesthetised mouse lying spread-eagled in anNMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) machine.\"We have this huge amount of technology we'vedeveloped to do all these studies, but I don't thinkthey've ever been applied to prevention before,\"he says. \"We detected a tumour less than a mil-limeter across.\" When he's not doing research, he spends time doing what the teachers he once revered didfor him - leaving his office door open so that he'salways available to his students, and working one-on-one with them when they need him. He'shopeful that his students, in the not-so-distantfuture, will finish the job he's started. \"There are a huge number of drugs we can make as preventive agents and we have to find away between support from the government, theprivate sector, big Pharma and the oncology com-munity to see that they get developed for chemo-prevention,\" he says. \"If it's going to happen, it needs to be a co- operative effort.\" \"Drug companies need to see that chemoprevention drugs can be just as profitable as drugs like Lipitor\"\"I believe that essentially all the common forms of epithelial cancer are preventable\"On 25 April 1986, the crew of number 4reactor at theChernobyl nuclearpower plant in Northern Ukraine began tests for aroutine shut-down. The power plantswere of poor design and procedureshad become sloppy. As the reactorbegan to close down, the flow ofcoolant water diminished and poweroutput rose instead of falling. At this point, a design fault led to a dramatic power surge that rupturedthe fuel elements. Shortly after1.30 am on 26 April an explosion blewthe covering plate and roof off thereactor, releasing fission products intothe atmosphere.

But with leukaemia rates still rising, and a recent markedincrease in solid tumours among the 600,000 workers who were sent in to clean up themess, the real question is whether the worst may be yet to come. made up of xenon gas, iodine, cae- sium and other radioactive material.Most of the material was depositedclose by as dust and debris, whilelighter material was carried by thewind over Ukraine, Belarus andRussia. Enough material was carriedfurther afield to cause major con-cerns in Scandinavia, Europe and therest of the world. In the first few hours, firefighters and other emergency teams struggledto get fires under control and to start tomake the nuclear reactor 'safe'. About1,000 people, including on-site staff,were irradiated with up to 20,000 mil-lisieverts (mSv) on the first day. Ofthese 1000, 58 were to die from theeffects of acute radiation syndrome. On the day of the accident the winds were from the south, blowingthe fallout towards Belarus only adozen kilometres away. Later thewind veered, blowing the fallouttowards West Ukraine. Finally, itcame from the north, blowing south- wards towards Kiev. At first, the public was told little about the accident, as secrecy tookprecedence over public safety. Innearby Prypiat, on the day of theexplosion, a teacher took her childrenonto the bridge to watch the fire. OnApril 27, 49,360 people were evacu-ated from Prypiat, with no officialannouncement. Two days later, wed-dings were still being held inChernobyl, and people were cele-brating amidst the nuclear fallout. Communist Party leaders went ahead with the May Day celebrationsin Kiev and other cities, despite theradiation cloud covering the area. Aninternational cycle race also wentahead as planned. It wasn't until May2 and 3, a week after the accident,that 45,000 people were evacuatedfrom a 30-kilometre radius of thepower plant. A further 116,000 peo-ple were later relocated.

CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006 41 KOSTIN IGOR / CORBIS SYGMA While many clean-up workers believed radiation was harmless, there was something akin to panic in Kiev Where are they now? After the explosion, staff continued to be bussed into work to monitor and maintain the three remaining unda maged reactors. Their flimsy caps and face-masks show how little appreciation there was of the risks of working in such a heavily contaminated environmentSpotlight on... 42 CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006After two weeks of panic and spontaneous evacuation, on May 6Anatoly Romanenko, Minister ofHealth, finally went on state TV. Hisadvice was that people should closetheir windows and wash their handsand feet. Over the next period, 600,000 people from Russia, Belarus andUkraine were involved as \"liquida-tors\" or \"clean-up workers\", carryingout emergency work and cleaning upcontamination. In all about 250,000people were evacuated from affectedareas in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia,and resettled elsewhere. Only a fewthousand of these have everreturned. In those early weeks, while many of the clean-up workers believed thatradiation was harmless, there wassomething akin to panic 100 kilome-tres away, in Kiev. Volodymyr Yavorivsky, a Kiev deputy in the USSR Supreme Sovietand a critic of the regime, later toldthe Wall Street Journal how people packed their children into trains,buses and planes. \"My seven-year-olddaughter went to stay with friends inthe Carpathian Mountains, but even-tually I learned that it was preciselythere that a plume of dangerousradioactive fallout had fallen.Meanwhile the elite had their chil-dren evacuated to safe zones on thefirst day of the accident.\" Today, 20 years later, there are still two truths about Chernobyl. Theconservative line is that the explosionwas directly responsible for 58 deathsand about 4,000 cases of thyroid can-cer in children (attributing only nine child deaths from thyroid cancer toradiation). The UN Atomic EnergyAgency predicts that there will even-tually be 4,000 deaths as a result ofChernobyl. A report in September2005, Chernobyl: The True Scale of the Accident , endorsed by UN AEA, the World Health Organization andthe UN Development Programme,said that \"no evidence or likelihood ofdecreased fertility among the affect-ed population has been found, norhas there been any evidence ofincreases in congenital malforma-tions that can be attributed to radia-tion exposure.\" The other truth suggests a world- wide cover-up of catastrophic conse-quences. In the run-up to the 20thanniversary this year, the EuropeanGreens launched The Other Report on Chernobyl , claiming that fallout contaminated 40% of Europe's sur-face area, and predicting 30,000-60,000 excess cancer deaths. TheBritish Guardian newspaper even carried a report claiming that500,000 people have already diedbecause of the accident, althoughthis figure is widely disputed. The lack of agreement on data relating to the number of deaths orcancers caused by Chernobyl is inpart because all figures are seen ashaving a political angle. But there arealso genuine difficulties in under-standing and interpreting the data. In 1986, soon after the disaster, the Research Centre for RadiationMedicine was established to addressan anticipated increase in cancercases and to treat acute radiation syn- drome and other diseases. Today it ishoused in a ten-storey building in aKiev suburb, treating 400 adults and134 children who are considered 'vic-tims of Chernobyl'. The centre has collaborated with the US National Cancer Instituteand with researchers from France,Germany, Italy and Japan to try topredict how many people will devel-op cancer because of the Chernobylexplosion. Anaytoly Prysyazhnyuk, head of the cancer epidemiology laboratory atthe centre, took charge of data col-lection soon after the accident, visit-ing contaminated areas - includinghis parental home at Narodychi -and making studies of what he found. Prysyazhnyuk has worked on a range of studies with a Russian teamand a French team from theInternational Agency for Research onCancer in Lyon. His best estimate is that there has been an increase of more than8,000 cancer cases in the affectedareas of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.However, he says that there wasalready evidence of a rising trend incancers before Chernobyl, and whenthis is taken into account the realnumber of 'excess cancers' is about5,400 from 1986 to 2004. In the year following the accident there were repeated reports from dis-tricts around Chernobyl of largeincreases in cancer. He says that,when he investigated, he found manywere due to the improvements inregistration. Between 1989 and 2001, life expectancy for men in Ukraine fell from 66 to 63 yearsSpotlight on... CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006 43The most alarming statistic is the falling life expectancy in Ukraine.Between 1989 and 2001, lifeexpectancy for men in Ukraine fellfrom 66 to 63 years and for womenfrom 75 to 73.8 years. In 2001 theEuropean figures for life expectancywere 75.2 years for men and 81.4years for women. The economic situation, a rise in poverty, and an increase in drinkinghave all been implicated in shorten-ing life spans. However, theChernobyl accident, the massive dis-location of populations, anxiety aboutfuture health prospects and theincrease in cancers are all factors. Dimitry Bazyka, an immunologist and deputy director of the ResearchCentre for Radiation Medicine inKiev, has lived with the after-effectsof Chernobyl personally and profes-sionally. His father, Anatoli Bazyka,had been a doctor working in an areaof the Soviet Union where nucleartesting was carried out, but in 1986had just retired. On the day of the accident he was visiting land he hadbought for his retirement home closeto the Chernobyl power station. Hereceived a significant dose of radia-tion, and three months later he wasdiagnosed with liver cancer, whichrapidly killed him. Bazyka says his father was an example of the way that radiationpromotes existing cancers. \"We can-not say that his cancer started on 26April, when three months later it wasmanifested clinically. It started sever-al years before. But after the secondirradiation it started to move veryquickly. So this is what we mean by'promoting' cancer.\" Later come the cancers induced by radiation: leukaemia, thyroid can-cer, lung, urinary, renal, colon andbreast cancers. The question is: Howmany, and how much later? Using protocols established at the International Commission onRadiation Protection, the first predic-tions in 1986 were of 50,000 deaths worldwide from all causes. Since 1996, there has been a joint study between Ukraine, Belarusand Russia with France andGermany, of cancers, child mortalityand other diseases in the most affect-ed areas. A report on data for eightyears is due this year. Leukaemia is recognised as a marker for radiation-induced can-cers, since it is induced many yearsearlier than solid tumours. The threecountries have completed a separatestudy of leukaemia cases in clean-upworkers, working with the USNational Cancer Institute. The fig-ures are not due to be released untillater this year, but are expected toshow a significant increase, withleukaemias in this group running atmore than twice the rate expected ina similar-sized population. Sergeiy Klymenko, a researcher at the Institute of Clinical Radiologyin Kiev, says that these cases are very A potential timebomb. Dimitry Bazyka, from the Research Centrefor Radiation Medicine in Kiev,says the biggest rise in solid tumourscaused by the Chernobyl explosionis still to come PETER MCINTYRESpotlight on... 44 CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006hard to treat. \"We can see that Chernobyl leukaemias are worsethan spontaneous leukaemias. TheChernobyl cases have a lot of nega-tive prognostic markers, and we cansee in the clinic that they behaveworse. The complete remission rateis lower and the survival is shorter.\" So not only are clean-up workers more likely to develop leukaemia,they are much more likely to die. Theoverall survival of those with acutemyeloid leukaemia is about half ofother AML patients. The Kiev team is keen to treat these patients with allogenic bonemarrow transplantation. This is notyet a core programme in the Ukraine,partly because of expense and partlybecause of lack of matching donors.A blood and bone marrow donor reg-istry run by the former Soviet Union was closed down a few years after theSoviet Union broke up. Klymenkosays: \"We cannot apply to world tis-sue banks for donors. There is avicious circle.

Bazyka says that the graph of leukaemias is still rising, which hasworrying implications for solidtumour cancers. \"We can predict thatthe increase in cancer numbers will be later than in Japan.

He recalls a visit toSlavutich (built to replace the neigh-bouring town of Prypiat), where onenuclear worker who had beenexposed to radiation told him he wassure that there were no harmfuleffects. \"Five minutes later he toldme about a doctor who had saved hislife by finding he had renal cancerand carrying out surgery.

The appearance of the first ever resolution on cancer prevention andcontrol on the agenda of the WorldHealth Assembly last year is anencouraging sign that things are mov-ing in the right direction. But it takesmore than a resolution to change thereality on the ground. This is why,three years ago, the InternationalUnion Against Cancer (UICC) com-mitted itself to promoting WorldCancer Day as part of a global cam-paign \"to raise awareness of the can-cer burden and to promote cancercontrol and patient needs in all coun-tries throughout the world\", and lastyear it launched its own WorldCancer Campaign - starting with the'My Child Matters' initiative onchildhood cancers.STARTING WITH THE CHILDREN Last November, the My Child Mattersinitiative awarded grants to 14 child-hood cancer projects in 10 resource-constrained countries - Bangladesh,Egypt, Honduras, Morocco, thePhilippines, Senegal, Tanzania,Ukraine, Venezuela and Vietnam. Theprojects were financed by sanofi-aventis, with top-up funding from theUS National Cancer Institute makingit possible to fund 14 projects insteadof the 10 originally proposed. Why the focus on children? \"Childhood cancer is a small fractionof the global cancer burden, yet forchildren with cancer and their fami-lies it can be deeply distressing,\"explains Isabel Mortara, UICC'sexecutive director. \"This is especiallyso in poorer countries, where child-hood cancer is often detected too lateto be treated effectively and appro-priate treatment is often not affordable.\"P\u00e1raic R\u00e9amonn* *P\u00e1raic CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006 47In such countries, she notes, three out of every five children with cancerwill die. But given the minimal con-ditions for early detection and correcttreatment, many of these childrencould be saved. Here, relatively little money can make a big difference. \"We start withthe children,\" says Franco Cavalli,who chairs the My Child Matterscommittee and will take over asUICC's president at the WorldCancer Congress in Washington DCthis July, \"because by demonstrating that we can cure children, we showthat we can do something againstcancer.\" ADVOCATING In Calgary this March, St\u00e9phaneLambiel of Switzerland held on tothe world figure-skating title he wonin Moscow last year. In between thetwo championships, he agreed toserve as an ambassador in UICC'schildhood cancer campaign. \"Canceris a terrible thing at any age, but especially among the very young,\"Lambiel says. \"My heart goes out tothose children in many countries -the little princes and princesses ofour world - who get cancer but don'tget the early diagnosis and promptand effective treatment they need tosave their lives.\" Another advocate for children with cancer is Barbara Bush, the for-mer United States First Lady, wholost her daughter Robin to leukaemia.Also supporting the My ChildMatters initiative are two Europeanfootball legends - England's GaryLineker and Germany's FranzBeckenbauer. Lineker's oldest son isa childhood leukaemia survivor. \"Myfamily and I are proud to support acampaign that aims to raise aware-ness of childhood cancer,\" he says.\"We believe that children with cancershould never stop having hope anddreaming of their future life.\" EDUCATING As part of the My Child Matters ini-tiative, UICC recently published aspecial report, Childhood Cancer: Rising to the Challenge . With two chapters by the International Agencyfor Research on Cancer, a thirdchapter by the International Psycho-Oncology Society, and an introductionby Tim Eden, the president of theInternational Society of PaediatricOncology (SIOP), it gives a glimpseof the \"invincible alliance\" called forsix years ago. A second report, making a com- prehensive analysis of the chain ofcare in paediatric oncology in the 10countries initially selected in the ini-tiative, with proposals to improve theallocation of resources, will be pub-lished later.

UICC hopes that over the years, the projects supported will do morethan show what can be done - theywill serve as a wake-up call for politi-cians and decision-makers for whomcancer is often still not a priority. UICC's campaign comes at an opportune moment. For years, devel-oping countries have regarded cancerand other chronic diseases as a prior-ity - for richer nations. Not anylonger. Following the resolution at the World Health Assembly last May, theWorld Health Organization pub- lished a landmark report entitledPreventing Chronic Diseases: a VitalInvestment. In this report, WHO proposes a new global goal: to reduce the pro-jected trend of chronic disease deathrates by 2% each year until 2015.If achieved, this would avert over8 million deaths due to cancer in thenext decade. Richard Horton, the editor of the Lancet , introducing an influential series of Lancet articles on what he calls the \"neglected epidemic\" ofchronic disease, says, \"While thepolitical fashions have embraced some diseases - HIV/AIDS, malaria,and tuberculosis, in particular -many other common conditionsremain marginal to the mainstreamof global action on health. Chronicdiseases are among those neglectedconditions.\" It seems that fashions are chang- ing. With World Cancer Day and itsWorld Cancer Campaign, UICC isdetermined to see that they do. Founded in 1933, UICC (www.uicc.org) is the onlyinternational non-governmental organisation that isdedicated exclusively to the global control of cancer.For further information, contact info@uicc.org\"By demonstrating that we can cure children, we show that we can do something against cancer\" UICCClaudia S\u00e1nchez Machuca from the Paediatric launch of 'My Child Matters' in Parislast February.

Since no difference in survival was noted in this study, an importantquestion to address is quality of life.Unfortunately, since this componentof the study was optional and few par-ticipated, this issue could not beaddressed. Progression of disease canlead to worsening neurological impair-ment. As demonstrated in this study,seizures were better controlled in theupfront radiation arm. Some patientsmight worry about the lack of activetreatment and higher rate of progres-sion without upfront treatment. A keyquestion that needs to be answered iswhat impact delaying radiation thera-py has on quality of life. Are there subsets of patients in whom upfront radiation might notprovide any advantage? Based on thedata from the RTOG 9110 trial,patients who are younger than 40years old, have tumours less than5 cm, and have a gross total resection,have a better overall survival. 2To test the hypothesis that radiation can bedelayed in these patients, the phaseII arm of RTOG 9802 observedpatients who were younger than old and underwent gross totalresections.

While the study showed no improvement in overall survival, thefive-year progression-free survival inthe upfront radiation arm was the controlarm (log-rank P<0.0001).

Another question to be answered is whether upfront chemotherapy canreplace radiation as the initial therapyfor low-grade gliomas. The EORTC isconducting a study comparing temo-zolomide alone to radiation alone. Inaddition to studying progression-free survival, quality of life will be assessed. The EORTC 22845 study addressed a key question and showeda benefit for upfront radiation. Yet,there are many questions to beanswered regarding the optimal treat-ment of low-grade gliomas, many ofwhich will be addressed by the above- mentioned studies. Further under-standing of the biology of low-gradegliomas and identification of molecu-lar markers is needed to develop indi-vidualised treatment strategies.

Lancet 366:985-990 Background. There are no evidence-based guidelines to direct the treatment of patients with low-grade glioma, and it remains unclear whether early treatment has an impact on outcome. Objective. To compare the long-term efficacy of early, postoperative radiotherapy for low-grade glioma with that of delayed treatment, including radiotherapy, when tumour progression occurs. Design and intervention. Patients aged 16-65 years were included if they had supratentorial and histologically proven low-grade astrocytoma, orKarnofsky performance status** (KPS) 60, and no other systemic diseases or malignancies. Participants were randomised to receive early radiotherapy (within 8 weeks of resective surgery), or treatment, including radiotherapy, when tumour pro-gression occurred (control). Clinical and CT examination were carried out at baseline, every 4 months for 2 years, and thenevery year until tumour recurrence. The total radiotherapy dose was 54 Gy (in 5 fractions of 1.8 Gy/week for 6 weeks).Data were analysed by intention to treat. Event-free rates were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis, a conditional prob-ability strategy used for estimation of survival in clinical trials with censored observations. The two study groups were com-pared using the log-rank test. Outcome measures. The primary outcomes were the durations of progression-free survival and overall survival times, both calculated from the date of randomisation to the date of progression. Results. Among the 311 patients randomised, after a median of 7.8 years of follow-up, tumour progression had occurred in 217 patients (70%), and 156 patients (50%) had died. Known causes of death were progressive brain tumour ( n= 142, (including were found in 48/253 patients (19%).The median overall survival was 7.4 years (95% CI 6.1-8.9 years) in the control group and 7.2 years (95% CI 6.4-8.6 years)in the treatment group (hazard ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.71-1.34), with no significant difference between groups (log-rank P= 0.873). Median progression-free survival was 3.4 years (95% CI 2.9-4.4 years) among control patients, and 5.3 years (95%CI 4.6-6.3 years) in the early radiotherapy group (hazard ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0.45-0.77), with significantly longer progression-free survival in those receiving early radiotherapy (log-rank P<0.0001). After progression, survival times were 3.4 years in the control group and 1.0 year in the radiotherapy group (overall log-rank P<0.0001). Seizure control was similar in the two groups at baseline, but 1 year after surgery the number of progression-free patients with seizures was 26/102 (25%) in the radio-therapy group, and control group ( P= 0.0329). Radiotherapy was interrupted owing to acute reactions in six patients; other toxic effects were moderate, including skin reactions, otitis and mild headache. Conclusions. Compared with treatment at the time of tumour progression, immediate postoperative radiotherapy lengthens progression-free survival by 2 years, but overall survival is unchanged.

The results of the international Multicenter Selective Lympha-denectomy Trial MSLT-1 (see oppo-site) clearly define the feasibility,accuracy and morbidity rate ofLM/SLNB within a randomised clin-ical trial. The overall rate of SLNidentification was 95.3%, with thehighest rate in the inguinal basin(99.3%), followed by the axillary(96.6%) and the cervical (84.5%)area. The poor rate of SLN identifi-cation in the cervical area might berelated to the complex lymphaticdrainage in the head and neckregion. The accuracy of identifica-tion was estimated by assessing theincidence of same-basin recurrencein regional nodal metastases,although 11 of these 59 patients hadrecurrence in a basin that was notsampled. Fifty-two of the 944patients (5.5%) had local or in-transitrecurrence, and in 8 patients this occurred before nodal recurrence,which could have been the source ofmetastasis to the previously dissect-ed lymph basin ('biological failure').Notably, the dissected-basin recur-rence rate was 10.3% for the first 25cases of the trial, but this ratedecreased to 5.2% after 25 cases,suggesting an increase in the sur-geon's proficiency with the proce-dure following the 'learning was 30-case 'learning each surgeon had documentedat least 15 consecutive cases, sur-geons who treat only a fewmelanoma patients each year do notseem to have the experience requiredfor a high degree of mapping accura-cy.

Second, thepathologic staging of all regionallymph nodes underestimates the truefrequency of nodal metastasis by asmuch as 14% compared with thefocused analysis of one or few sen-tinel lymph nodes (SLNs). 2,3Hence, lymphatic mapping/SLN biopsy(LM/SLNB) has been proposed as aminimally invasive surgical proce-dure for staging of the regional nodalbasin that detects occult metastasis * Marco Gipponi is an associate in the Department of General Surgery of San Martino University Hospital of Genoa, ItalyThis article was first published in Nature Clinical Practice Oncology 2006 vol. 3 no. 3, and is reproduced with permission. www.nature.com/clinicalpractice doi:10.1038/ncponc0448. \u00a92006 Nature Publishing Group Marco Gipponi*Is intraoperative lymphatic mapping and sentinel node biopsy effective and safe in early-stage melanoma?

(2005) Sentinel node biopsy for early-stage melanoma: accuracy and morbidity in MSLT-I, an international multicenter trial. Ann Surg 242:302-311 Background. Studies in breast cancer, melanoma, colon cancer, lung cancer and almost all solid malignancies that spread to lymph nodes have confirmed that metastatic cells move in an orderly manner from the primary site through the lym-phatic system to one or two regional sentinel nodes. Lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy (LM/SLNB) isused to identify occult nodal metastases and thus stage the regional nodal basin to target the subset of patients who wouldbenefit from complete lymph node dissection (CLND). LM/SLNB has become an important and well established tech-nique for the staging of melanoma. Objective. To assess the accuracy and clinical efficacy of LM/SLNB for staging of the regional nodal basin, and to estab- lish its effect on the incidence of morbidity in patients with early-stage melanoma. Design and intervention. In the international phase III Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial (MSLT-1), patients aged 18-75 years with cutaneous melanoma (Breslow's thickness* 1 mm with Clark level** III, or any Breslow's thickness with Clark level of IV or V) were accrued over 11 years. Sites of melanoma were the trunk, headand neck, extremities, sole of the foot, palm of the hand or a subungual site. In a 'learning phase' of 30 consecutive cases,each of 18 centres in the USA, Europe and Australia were required to demonstrate a sentinel lymph node (SLN)identification rate that was 85% accurate. Patients were randomly assigned to wide excision (WE) plus observation withcomplete lymphadenectomy if nodal metastases subsequently became clinically evident, or WE plus LM/SLNB withimmediate CLND for any sentinel node metastases. Outcome measures. The accuracy of LM/SLNB and the incidence of early morbidity were assessed. Results. After a median follow-up of 54 months (range 3 months-10 years), 1,973 patients were eligible for analysis, 800 of whom received WE plus observation and 1,173 of whom received WE plus LM/SLNB. The rate of identification of SLNusing LM/SLNB was 95.3% overall, and such rates were higher in the inguinal and axillary regions than in the cervicalregion (99.3% and 96.6% vs 84.5%). Among the 944 patients tumour-negative SLNs, regional nodal recurrenceoccurred in 59 patients (6.3%), and 11 of these patients had recurrence in a basin that had not been sampled. Fifty-twopatients had local or in-transit recurrence, which developed in eight patients before nodal recurrence. In 10 centres, whichhad accrued a total of 918 patients in the study, the dissected-basin recurrence rate was 10.3% for the first 25 cases and5.2% after 25 further cases. No operative mortalities were reported, surgical complications associated with WE were low,and LM/SLNB did not affect the incidence of surgical morbidity at the primary site. Addition of the CLND procedure inpatients undergoing LM/SLNB increased the rate of complications in the dissected basin from 10.1% to 37.2% ( P<0.0001). Conclusions. LM/SLNB can accurately with an associated low morbidity rate; these subclinical lymph node metastases are likely to develop to more advanced, palpable nodal disease if left untreated.

Multiple myeloma accounts for about 1% of all cancers diagnosed in Europe. Itsincidence increases with age, and more than80% of cases are diagnosed in people over60 years old. Since 1960 oral melphalan andprednisone (MP) have been regarded as thestandard of care in elderly multiplemyeloma patients. Thalidomide has shown some promise in previous clinical trials when combinedwith chemotherapy agents. The drug wasoriginally developed to prevent morningsickness in pregnant women; tragically itcaused birth defects in the unborn foetus.Researchers discovered that thalidomideinterfered with the growth of blood vesselsin foetal limbs and reasoned that thalido-mide might also interfere with the growthof blood vessels in tumours. In a trial involving 255 patients, Antonio Palumbo (University of Torino, Italy)and colleagues found that those treatedwith melphalan, prednisone, and thalido-mide had higher response rates and longerevent-free survival than those who weretreated with MP alone. This benefit, how-ever, must be balanced against increasedrates of thrombosis, neurological toxiceffects and infection, warn the authors.

Rates of taxane use increased primarily in women with node-positive breast cancerin early 1998, and it also increased inwomen with node-negative breast cancerby the end of 1999, even though suchwomen were not included in the taxanestudy.

Patients with MDS have shownto benefit from new DNA hypo-methylat-ing agent: decitabine. Researchers, led byMichael Lubbert of the University ofFreiburg Medical Centre, Germany, assessedthe efficacy of retreating on relapse high-risk MDS patients who had already receivedinitial treatment with the drug. Patients hada median of three further courses ofdecitabine, and 45% of patients responded,but had a poorer response than was shownafter the first treatment. As a result of thestudy, researchers believe that longer initialtreatments of decitabine may be more ben-eficial to patient outcome. Ten out of 22 patients responded to decitabine when given an average of threecourses of the drug. Three patients achieveda partial or complete response in red cells,white cells and platelets. The other sevenpatients experienced at least a 50% drop inblood transfusion requirements and highercell counts in one or two of the blood celllines. All patients had an average survival of28 months. Patients who were retreatedwith decitabine had a median survival of 13months after their relapse.

Define metastatic breast cancer guide- lines. Most women still die from metastatic breast cancer. The general criteria on how tomanage metastatic breast cancer need to bedefined. Specific guidelines can help thepatient and the clinician make the rightchoice.5. Increase the number of breast care nurses . In most European countries today there are no breast care nurses. Breast carenurses can improve the treatment and man-agement of breast cancer for patients.Greater involvement will improve patientcare and quality of life. 6. Expand the Breast Unit accreditation process . Breast units should be accredited to ensure that they meet guideline require-ments for standardisation of best care.Accreditation guidelines for carrying thisout should be developed not only by profes-sionals, but also by patient advocacy groups.Women should have equity of access andthe choice to select appropriate facilities fordiagnosis and treatment and be sure theyare getting gold standard care. 7. Give recognition to the essential role played by charities in independent breastcancer research . Encourage those charities to realise thepotential benefits of their effort for allEuropean patients and to expand their workeven further. 56 CANCER WORLD MAY-JUNE 2006Impact Factor Organisers of the European BreastCancer Conference (EBCC) - Europa Donna (the European Breast CancerCoalition), the European Organisation forResearch and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)and the European Society of Mastology(EUSOMA) - have issued a manifesto inorder to highlight what needs to be done tosupport breast cancer research and improvepatient outcomes. The Nice Manifesto high-lights seven areas for action:1. Improve the number and quality of European screening programmes . Population-based screening programmescarried out in accordance with EU guide-lines for quality assurance inmammography screening help to detectearly breast cancer and save lives. Increasingthe number of screening programmes freeat the point of access and improving theirquality would save the lives of manyEuropean women. Women should beencouraged to participate in screening pro-grammes.2. Support breast cancer research . Independent academic research is underthreat due to insufficient funding in manyEuropean countries. It is a driving force inimproving our knowledge of cancer andAdvocates, clinicians and researchers callfor action on breast cancer EBCC - NiceResearch looking at clinical trials has found a dramatic drop in the number of new trials undertaken since the EU clinicaltrials directive came into force in 2004. Theclinical trials directive was intended to pro-tect patients and improve researchstandards. But many investigators warnedat the time that the labour-intensive,bureaucratic, and expensive endeavour ofrunning a clinical trial would become worseunder the new rules. In particular, grant-funded academic researchers, who performed most cancertrials, raised concerns that their resourcesmight not suffice to meet the requirementsof the new directive. An analysis of research undertaken since the directive was implemented sug-gests that many of those fears have beenrealised. For example, the number of newtrials fell from 19 in 2004 to 7 in 2005 (a63% decrease), and a third fewer patientswere enrolled. Simultaneously, trial costs increased by 85% and insurance costs from 70 mn to 140mn euros. Trial initiation took about fivemonths longer than in 2004, while paper-work and documentation increased. Instead of benefiting patients, the analysis suggests that the directive has hin-dered their access to new treatments. \"Our own experiences are in accor- dance with these findings,\" say the authorsAkseli Hemminki and Pirkko-LiisaKellokumpu-Lehtinen, from HelsinkiUniversity Central Hospital and TampereUniversity Hospital, in Finland. The numberof approved applications for both academicand company-sponsored cancer trials inHelsinki steadily decreased, from 120 in2002 to 70 in 2005 (42% decrease), but theworkload of the ethics committee increased.These numbers seem to confirm the initial worries about the future of investigator-ini-tiated clinical cancer research, conclude theauthors, adding that new directives on clin-ical research are in preparation, andphysicians, patients, universities, and politi-cians need to take action to ensure thatacademic research can continue in Europe.

Cooperation on medicines regulation intensified European Medicines Agency Recent research from the 'million women study', presented at the European Breast Cancer Conference in Nice, found that takinghormone replacement therapy (HRT)increased the risk of some types of breastcancer, but not others. The research foundthat women who took HRT had an increasedrisk of developing lobular cancer (affectingthe cells in the ducts of the milk-producingglands) and tubular cancer. There was notsuch an increased risk of developing ductalbreast cancer, the most common type ofbreast cancer that affects the cells lining themilk duct. There was no increase in the risk ofmedullary breast cancer, a kind of cancerthat is common in women with a geneticpredisposition to breast cancer. The study demonstrated that women who had taken combined HRT (oestrogenand progesterone) had an even greater risk ofdeveloping lobular and tubular breast cancerthan women on oestrogen-only HRT. Theresearchers also discovered similar findingsfor women with breast cancer in situ - whenthe cancer has not spread to the surroundingtissues in the breast or other parts of thebody. Women who took HRT had a signifi-cantly greater risk of developing lobularcancer in situ than ductal carcinoma in situ. Gillian Reeves, who presented the find- ings, comments, \"One possible explanationfor the findings is that certain types of breastcancer are more likely than others to be hor-mone receptive.

HPVs are a group of more than 70 dif- ferent types of virus. They are given numbersto distinguish them. Strains of the HPV virushave been associated with other epithelialcancers such as cervical cancer (particularlynumbers 16, 18, 30 and 33) and oesophaguscancers. HPV types 5 and 8 have beendetected in skin tumours and previous stud-ies have suggested they may play a role in thedevelopment of these cancers. Several vac-cines are in development to help preventinfection from the two most prevalent can-cer-causing types of the human papilloma virus, HPV 16 and 18, which together areresponsible for over 70% of cervical cancers. Margaret Karagas, of Dartmouth Medical School, and colleagues searched for antibod-ies to 16 different HPV types in plasmasamples from 252 patients with squamouscell carcinoma, 525 patients with basal cellcarcinomas (BCC), and 461 control subjects. The authors detected genus beta type HPV antibodies in patients diagnosed withSCC more frequently than in control subjects,particularly HPV 5. No difference was foundin the presence of HPV antibodies in patientswith BCC compared to control subjects. The authors write, \"Although sun expo- sure and sun sensitivity are the major riskfactors for [skin] cancers, our data support arole of HPV, particularly beta HPVs, in thedevelopment of SCC.\" It may be possible in the future to pro- duce a vaccination that can help preventsome cases of squamous cell carcinoma.

Breast cancer associated with preg- nancy has a poor prognosis, including anincreased risk of metastases. Researchersfound that late diagnosis and increased hor-mone production during pregnancy may notbe sufficient to account for increased mor-tality. There is overwhelming evidence tosuggest that pregnancy has a preventativeeffect on breast cancer. However, some stud-ies indicate that pregnancy may cause aperiod of tumour promotion before it pro-duces its protective effect. The short durationof increase in breast cancer following preg-nancy was found to peak 6 years afterpregnancy and to carry on approximately 10years following childbirth. Breast cancerdiagnosis during this period is referred to aspregnancy-associated breast cancer. After pregnancy and lactation, the mam- mary gland that produces the milk regressesto its pre-pregnancy state by a tissue remod-elling process. The Colorado researchers foundthat this remodelling, which is associatedwith pro-inflammatory and wound-healingmechanisms, may help tumour cells spread. In healthy women, after pregnancy the mammary gland reverts to its pre-pregnancystate and pro-inflammatory pathways areactivated, but the balance of pro- to anti-inflammatory signals leans towards prevent-ing inflammation. The authors suggest that,in women with hidden breast tumours, thismay aggravate the tumour-promotingmicro-environment, by tipping the balancetowards overt inflammation. Women withhidden disease after pregnancy might be atan increased risk of tumour cell dissemination.Pepper Schedin, author of the paper, states that, \"Effective breast cancer screening inrecently pregnant women is warrantedimmediately.\" Pregnancy-associated breast cancer and metasta- sis.

Nature Reviews Cancer 6:281-291Breast tissue changes may cause pregnancy-associatedbreast cancer Nature Reviews Cancer Countries that have national health serv- ices easily accessible to people of all ages are likely to have better survival rates fortheir teenagers and young adults (TYAs) withcancer than are countries where individualshave to pay for their own medical insurance. This is the suggestion that arises from new research presented at the 4thInternational Conference on Teenage andYoung Adult Cancer Medicine, in which thehealth care systems of the United States ofAmerica and Australia were compared. Archie Bleyer, medical advisor at the Cancer Treatment Center, St Charles MedicalCenter, Bend, Oregon, told the conferencethat Australia's system of health insurancefor all, regardless of age, meant that TYAswere more likely to survive cancer inAustralia than they were in the USA. \"Our previous research has shown that the survival of older teenagers and youngadults with cancer in the United States haslagged behind progress in younger and olderpatients. We found that diagnosis wasdelayed in TYAs who either lacked healthinsurance or had inadequate insurance, andtherefore this lack of progress might be dueto the USA health care system, and lessexpected in countries with national healthinsurance. \"During the past year we compared sur- vival of TYAs in the USA with those inAustralia, a country similar in many demo-graphics to the USA, but with health insur- ance provided to all citizens regardless ofage. \"From 1982 to 1998, the rate of improvement in the 5-year survival frominvasive cancer in Australia exceeded thatwhich occurred in the USA, such that by thelate 1990s, TYAs in Australia had an overall 5-year cancer survival that was higher than inthe USA. The deficit begins at 16 and ends at55, the same years that national health insur-ance is not available in the USA. It rangesfrom 5% for 18 to 25 year-olds to 12% forthose aged 30 to 35. This difference suggeststhat the health care system in Australia, withuniversal health insurance, was able to pro-vide better cancer care to its TYAs. \"The advantage for Australian TYAs was not apparent in their children or older adultswith cancer. This suggests that the need forprivate health insurance in the USA isresponsible for the worse survival of TYAs, inthat children and older adults in the USA aremore adequately insured than TYAs.\" Teenagers more likely to survive cancer in countrieswith public health systems Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Medicine Conference New data released by IMS Health show that in 2005 global pharmaceutical sales grew 7% to $602 billion. North Americaaccounted for 47% of global sales, while only30% of sales were in Europe, probablyreflecting the strict cost-containment meas-ures adopted by European governments. There was an 18.6% increase in sales of anti-cancer drugs (cytostatics), with globalsales of $28.5 billion.

Part I provides a general introductionto palliative nursing care, with anextensive, excellent chapter on com-munication - this being the corner-stone of end-of-life care.Part II covers the critical area ofsymptom assessment and manage-ment, without omitting subjects suchas fatigue, sexuality and complemen-tary/alternative therapies. Part III addresses psychosocial support andPart IV spiritual support, whichincludes a chapter on \"meaning in ill-ness\". Further sections cover special patient populations (the poor, home- less, etc.), end-of-life care in variousareas (home care, palliativechemotherapy and clinical trials inadvanced cancer), and innovativecommunity projects.Beyond this, the book has severalunique features. The content of eachchapter is illustrated at the top by aquote from a patient or family mem-ber and case examples are used toanchor the theoretical and practicalcontent in real-life situations. Onefinds, for example, a narrative ondying based on a spouse's perspec- tive. The book also goes beyond thebiological model of cancer to illus-trate that cancer is an illness withpanoramic social and psychological ramifications rather than just anorgan-based disease. \"You haveto treat a person like a wholeperson, not like a textbook,\" saysthe daughter of a patient, andindeed palliative care nursingreflects a holistic philosophywhere the patient and familycomprise the unit of care. I do not remember being moved by atextbook before, but I found thisbeautiful book moving, because of itshumanity, its sensitivity towards theother, and its empathy with the lone-liness of human beings when con-fronted with serious illness. The bookhas the courage to deal with the com-plexities of life and to look at the sickas unique individuals. This is a modelof what a medical book should be:science-based but always in touchwith the men and women we callpatients. Physicians should definitelytake a leaf out of this exemplarybook. * Cicely Saunders: Selected Writings 1958-2004 has just been published by OUPTextbook of Palliative Nursing 2nd editionEdited by Betty R University Press, 1268 pp, \u00a360 (hardback) Palliative nursing care is playing an increasingly vital role in providing hope, comfort and solace to seriously sick patients.

The authors of thisbook say 'yes', and in their book theyexplain the cancer-diet connection,advise on how to select the right fatsand carbohydrates to stave off cancer,and list the foods, herbs and spiceswhich they consider to be healthynutrients. The book also describesnumerous cancer-preventing mealsand mouthwatering recipes that aresupposed to help fight cancer as wellas offset the side-effects of treatment.A wealth of scientific references areincluded in every chapter to supportthe main thesis, and the studiesselected, naturally, tend to prove thepreventive influence of diet on cancer.But just as with the connectionbetween stress and cancer, actualproof is contradictory.

Even with the impact of the molecular biology approach tocancer, which will soon be felt indiagnostics, prognostics and tailoredtherapies, recent evidence shows thatbreast cancer is an exceedingly com-plex, enigmatic phenomenon thatcannot be viewed as a single disease.In light of the increase in earlydiagnoses, Early Breast Cancer is a welcome book. It provides a clearaccount of the subject and imparts toestablished practitioners, trainees inbreast cancer and other healthcareprofessionals a solid understanding,from epidemiology, genetics andscreening, to pathology, diagnosis,treatment and prevention. The booksheds light on the innumerable prob-lems of early breast cancer, withouteschewing controversial areas. Theissue of genetic testing is particularlywell discussed, providing useful ref-erences, and there is an extensivesection on screening, with an inter-esting chapter on the biological basisfor screening, and an extensive sec-tion on breast imaging.Therapeutic aspects are groupedtogether in a section titled'Multidisciplinary management ofBC'. The Anglo-Italian authors stressthat breast cancer must be treated byspecialised breast teams but, alas,except for a few lines on the psycho-logical effects of screening and onthe need to give support when break- Despite the modest decrease inmortality rates over the last 20 years, the incidence of breast cancercontinues to rise in Western soci-ing bad news, they almost completely ignore the human andpsychological side of breast cancer.This omission is all the more worryinggiven the wealth of technical detailand information provided on subjectssuch as advanced breast biopsyinstrumentation or informed consentin the management and research ofbreast cancer. What about thewomen themselves, who are forcedto undertake a life-changing journeyas a result of being diagnosed withbreast cancer?The distress and anxiety provoked bysuch a diagnosis, as well as other psy-chosocial issues, are not forgotten inDixon's book. As the title suggests,this is a book that targets a wide read-ership, catering to general practition-ers, nurses, trainee oncologists andmedical students alike. Its all-Britishline-up of authors deserve praise forsucceeding in writing an up-to-date,concise, clear, superbly illustrated(pictures, tables and diagrams), evi-dence-based work that covers all thevarious aspects of breast cancer(including breast reconstruction,male breast cancer etc.), as well asbenign breast conditions.They are also to be commended fortheir balanced, nuanced account ofbreast cancer. They describe what\"we think we know and understand\"as well as the challenges, uncertain-ties and unknowns of breast diseases.The book provides a thoroughoverview of adjuvant therapy (includ-ing the new aromatase inhibitor tri-als) and metastatic breast cancer, aswell as excellent chapters on the sys-temic treatment of primary operablebreast cancer (with reference toongoing trials) and on clinical trialson the management of early breastcancer.
