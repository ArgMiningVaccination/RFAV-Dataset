In its natural opaque form, Spodumene is worked as a lithium ore and processed into different grades for use in ceramics, glass, batteries, steel, fluxing agents and medicine. However, it is more highly prized and better known in the pale, transparent form as a gem mineral used in jewelry and healing, the most popular varieties being pink to violet Kunzite and green Hiddenite. (See their pages for more info.) This page will provide the properties of Triphane, the clear to yellow forms of Spodumene. The name Spodumene comes from the Greek, spodoumenos, meaning \"burnt to ash\" or \"reduced to ash,\" referring to the ashy color of early specimens or the grayish-white mass formed when the mineral is ignited. Spodumene is strongly pleochroic, shifting in colors depending on the angle of observation, and has a perfect cleavage and splintery fracture, making it difficult to facet. It forms in pink, violet, green, yellow, white, gray, colorless and brownish crystals. All forms fade in direct sunlight. The varieties of Spodumene include: [Kunzite ](/crystal-encyclopedia/kunzite)- most popular variety, ranging in color from pale transparent pink to light violet. It is beautiful as a gemstone with a brilliant shift in color, and is a Stone of Emotion, pure in energy and joyful in nature. It opens and connects the heart to the mind and stimulates a healing communion between the two. Kunzite encourages one to release walls built around the heart for protection, and to be receptive to the experience of unconditional and abundant love. (For more information, see the Kunzite page) [Hiddenite](/crystal-encyclopedia/hiddenite) or Green Kunzite - varies in color from pale green, to yellow-green, to deep emerald green. Also known as Lithia Emerald, it is rarer than Kunzite and is sometimes faceted into gemstones. Hiddenite is a Crystal of Evolution, helping individuals to grow spiritually, and to be aware of their collective responsibility for the care of the Earth. It supports new beginnings and focusing on the present, relinquishing injustices of the past or anxieties for the future. (For more information, see the Hiddenite page) Crystals labeled Spodumene, or Triphane, are typically colorless or light yellow, and are sometimes referred to as Clear or Yellow Kunzite. They are seldom used in faceted form, most are considered non-gem grade; however some clearer specimens do justify their use as gems and healing stones, and some healers and crystal practitioners regard the clear, white or gray crystals as having an even higher spiritual vibration than Kunzite. Triphane crystals are for cleansing and restoring. They remove negative energy and pollutants from the aura and emotional body, clear environments, and restore freshness, optimism and a sense of purpose. Rarities in Spodumene include a faint blue to bluish-green variety, as well bicolored or tricolored specimens.
