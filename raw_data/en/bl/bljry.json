The drug, called ISRIB, has already been shown in laboratory studies to restore memory function months after [traumatic brain injury](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2017/07/407656/drug-reverses-memory-failure-caused-traumatic-brain-injury), reverse cognitive impairments in Down Syndrome, prevent [noise-related hearing loss](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2018/10/412091/gene-plays-critical-role-noise-induced-deafness), fight [certain types of prostate cancer](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2018/05/410336/research-finds-achilles-heel-aggressive-prostate-cancer), and even [enhance cognition](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2013/06/106816/memory-boosting-chemical-identified-mice)in healthy animals. In the new study, published Dec. 1, 2020, in the open-access journal [eLife](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.62048), researchers showed rapid restoration of youthful cognitive abilities in aged mice, accompanied by a rejuvenation of brain and immune cells that could help explain improvements in brain function. \"ISRIB's extremely rapid effects show for the first time that a significant component of age-related cognitive losses may be caused by a kind of reversible physiological \"blockage\" rather than more permanent degradation,\" said Susanna Rosi, PhD, Lewis and Ruth Cozen Chair II and professor in the departments of Neurological Surgery and of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science. \"The data suggest that the aged brain has not permanently lost essential cognitive capacities, as was commonly assumed, but rather that these cognitive resources are still there but have been somehow blocked, trapped by a vicious cycle of cellular stress,\" added Peter Walter, PhD, a professor in the UCSF Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. \"Our work with ISRIB demonstrates a way to break that cycle and restore cognitive abilities that had become walled off over time....\" \"We've seen how ISRIB restores cognition in animals with traumatic brain injury, which in many ways is like a sped-up version of age-related cognitive decline,\" said Rosi, who is director of neurocognitive research in the UCSF Brain and Spinal Injury Center and a member of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences. \"It may seem like a crazy idea, but asking whether the drug could reverse symptoms of aging itself was just a logical next step.\" Forbes also reports that \"In all studies, the researchers "}
