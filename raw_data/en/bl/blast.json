Ketterhagen, The Center's spiritual director, and Shine will explain the basics of Ayurveda including making ghee, preparing an ayurvedic vegetarian stock called a \"dosha\" and watching the preparation of a \"20-minute vegetable curry.\" Participants will see, smell, and taste during this interactive learning experience, which will conclude with a meal of vegetable-curry with rice and a cucumber salad. Ketterhagen, a student of Ayurveda for over 10 years, will help participants understand the healing properties of many of the spices that will be used in Shine's cooking class. Participants will learn about their own dosha, the principles and healing power of taste, as well as foods and herbs that enhance health.
