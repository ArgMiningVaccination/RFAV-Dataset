Aimed at 6-15 year olds, the new channel provides a mix of content to keep them all engaged.Camera Operator Bronwyn Allomes keeps a close eye on the action as The Gruen Transfer is recorded in Studio 22 at the ABC's Ultimo Centre, Sydney. 1The ABC has a well established reputation for providing high-quality children's programming. A commitment to local content means Australians can be confident that their children are hearing Australian stories and perspectives being told in Australian voices. With ABC Kids on 2, and now ABC3, children of all ages have access to quality content on the ABC.The ABC has been entertaining television audiences for decades. Many well-known Australian performers started their career on the ABC. From The Norman Gunston Show to The Chaser , from The Inventors to The Gruen Transfer, the ABC provides a valuable, creative space for Australian talent to develop and Australian content to be made.The idea of public broadcasting arose soon after broadcasting itself commenced, based on an acknowledgement that civic and cultural needs\u2014informing, educating and entertaining\u2014might not always be commercially possible or profitable. To fill that gap, policy makers of the day established public broadcasting services to deliver a unique combination of public benefits\u2014universality, diversity, quality, independence and localism\u2014thereby meeting a range of important community needs. The social profit derived from those benefits remains as essential to contemporary life as it was almost a century ago. Public broadcasters provide a universal service to all citizens regardless of age, income or location. They deliver diverse content and choices that reflect the interests of the widest possible range of groups in society. They present programs that continually add to and refresh a sense of national identity and reflect cultural diversity. Without the need to ensure financial profitability, public broadcasters are able to pursue high-quality, informative and challenging content that enriches society, adding to audiences' experience, tastes and understanding. Public broadcasters strengthen democracy by providing independent news and information\u2014free from political or commercial influence\u2014that facilitates and stimulates public debate. Consistent with their commitment to universality, public broadcasters engage with local communities and deliver local news and information. Public broadcasters are particularly intrinsic to regional life, as the relative cost of providing localised services beyond major population centres is not a commercially attractive proposition. The ABC is Australia's primary public broadcaster, there for all Australians. It was created in an era of media scarcity to deliver services that would not otherwise have been available to every Australian. In today's age of media abundance, the ABC provides a continuing return on the public investment by delivering those fundamental services and fulfilling its Charter obligations to deliver programs of wide appeal and specialist interest. As the environment in which it operates changes, so must the ABC, adapting to technological advances and the changing expectations of its audiences. In doing so, the ABC will continue to deliver benefits to the public. Public broadcasting. Public benefit.2 Office of Maurice L.

CORPORATE OVERVIEW 5 About the ABC Section1 Since 1930, Australians have relied on the ABC to inform, educate and entertain them. As audiences become more diverse and new media platforms develop, the ABC has embraced the challenge of meeting the demand. Keeping audiences informed about local, national and international events and issues is fundamental to the ABC's role.

In this way, the link between public broadcasting and public benefit is constantly maintained and developed. Due to the extent and pace of change in the media, the meaning of the ABC's Charter and Act must continually be renewed, interpreted to reflect how these responsibilities can be fulfilled in contemporary ways. Strategy must be flexible. 2009-10 was a year of change for the ABC as the Corporation continued to harness the capabilities offered by digital technology to improve the efficiency with which it produces and distributes content to Australians and interacts with audiences. Innovations in digital technology continued to redefine how the ABC fulfils its responsibilities and the way in which much of its journalism and content production is done. The relationship between the Corporation and its audiences has also shifted. Audiences increasingly expect that, rather than having to come to the ABC, the Corporation's services and content will fit more easily into their lives and be available in many diverse ways. Media use is increasingly mobile and social. Australians expect to be more involved with their ABC, to participate and contribute. One of the Board's key responsibilities as set out by the Act is to ensure the ABC is efficient and provides maximum benefit to the Australian people. The Charter asks, among other things, that the ABC be innovative and comprehensive in its programming, and to provide a balance between specialised programs and those of wide appeal. It must take account of services provided by the commercial and community services of the Australian broadcasting system. 16 CORPORATE OVERVIEWBoard Directors' statement The ABC Act, which defines both the duties of the Board and the Corporation's responsibilities as set out in its Charter, has been in effect since 1983. Yet it is a living document and a constant guide to the Board when setting the strategic direction of the ABC to ensure its continuing relevance in the digital age. PUBLICBROADCASTINGPUBLICBENEFITDuring the past year, continued advances in digital technology and changing audience behaviour have presented the ABC both with new opportunities and potential new obligations. The Board applies the test of public benefit whether new services\u2014such as ABC3, ABC Open and new Australian dramas\u2014are based upon additional funding from Government or are\u2014like ABC iView, the proposed news channel ABC News 24 or the suite of ABC digital radio services\u2014funded from within the ABC's existing means. ABC Journalism in the Digital Age Two converging trends in the provision and consumption of news have given renewed emphasis to the Board's duty to ensure ABC news and information meets high and distinctive standards of editorial quality. Instead of directly accessing institutional news providers, audiences are increasingly gravitating to social networks for referrals to sources of news, opinion and entertainment. The ABC must continue to distinguish itself among these many alternatives by remaining a credible source of information in which people can confidently place their trust. Some commercial media organisations, contending with unprecedented financial challenges, have also indicated an intention to reduce the amount of freely-provided journalism. In such an environment it becomes particularly important that the ABC\u2014as a public broadcaster\u2014ensures that professional, independent journalism of quality continues to be made available to the public, informing the national conversation. Under the ABC Act, the Board must maintain the ABC's independence and integrity, ensure that its services are of a high standard, and that its news and information is independent, accurate and impartial. One of the Board's primary means of addressing these responsibilities is by developing the ABC Editorial Policies . By overseeing the ABC's observance of these policies, the Board aims to strengthen and protect the reputation and credibility of the ABC's journalism. There are many aspects to the ABC's self-regulatory framework, including response to and resolution of complaints, training and dealing with audience feedback. Public trust in ABC news and information depends upon standards of accuracy and editorial quality in ABC news and information. The ABC Editorial Policies are designed to guide staff to ensure the ABC reaches the highest editorial standards. Measuring performance against the policies provides accountability and encourages continuous improvement in the quality of ABC journalism. In August 2009, the Board adopted recommendations which arose from a review of the ABC's self-regulatory framework undertaken by the Director Editorial Policies and the Chairman. As one of the principal aspects of the self-regulatory framework, the ABC Editorial Policies must remain relevant to both contemporary practice and standards of objective journalism. A key recommendation of the review was to revise the ABC Editorial Policies to better reflect requirements arising from the ABC's increasingly instantaneous, continuous news services. This form of news delivery demands faster responses as new information appears, and wherever applicable, prompt corrections. Training goes to the heart of maintaining ABC editorial quality and the reputation that comes with it. The review also recommended a renewed emphasis on training, to ensure better understanding and practice of the ABC's editorial standards. CORPORATE OVERVIEW 17 1To augment the ABC's own Editorial Policies training, an agreement was reached with the BBC, which allows ABC staff to access the specialist resources of the BBC College of Journalism Online. The Board is confident that these changes to the application of the ABC Editorial Policies will enable ABC journalism to keep pace with the changing media environment and sustain its reputation for quality in the digital age. Australian Identity and ABC3 ABC3, the ABC's new children's digital television service, was launched by then Prime Minster Kevin Rudd on 4 December 2009. The ABC has long led the way in children's television in Australia. Its programs have become part of a commonly-shared experience of Australian childhood. The Corporation has taken advantage of extra channels made possible by digital television to continue, through ABC3, the important work of ensuring quality Australian children's content is freely available in the digital world. ABC3's role assumes particular significance now, when it has never been easier for Australian children to access international children's content. The new channel, along with ABC1 and ABC2, will help young Australians grow up watching, hearing and participating in their own stories, in their own language and with their own accents. In doing so it will, as the ABC Charter requires, contribute to shaping a sense of Australian identity. At a time when so many of the impressions that last us all our lives are being formed, it will also promote the interest and confidence of young Australians in their own culture. When it began, ABC3 offered 40% Australian content, with a target for 2010 of 50% of Australian content. It is now the most popular children's service within Australian television. This success will help build connections between the ABC as a public broadcaster and an Australian public in whose lives it will continue to play a part in the future. MediaHub and ABC News 24 Many significant changes in program production at the ABC have been made inevitable by the rapid turnover of, and innovations in, digital technology. However, the Board has also elected to, wherever possible, embrace opportunities presented by developments in technology that will increase the public benefit provided by the ABC. One such opportunity was presented through a new means of content distribution, MediaHub, which was launched on 30 June 2010. MediaHub will enable the ABC to deliver television content in the most efficient and cost-effective manner now possible. It also permits the ABC to, for the first time, individualise television services for the States and Territories as needed. This flexibility is particularly important to the ABC as the national emergency broadcaster when, during times of emergency such as floods and fires, the ABC must always be reliable, and respond to rapidly changing conditions with continuously updated information. News feeds from international sources and ABC studios around the country will be able to be arranged through MediaHub. The localisation enabled by MediaHub has also been a necessary foundation for the new round-the-clock news services to be provided by ABC News 24 in the second half of 2010. Cost savings in production and distribution have been redirected to content creation for the ABC News 24 service. MediaHub's new distribution capacity, along with innovative production techniques such as studio automation and desktop editing, have given the ABC a secure foundation for its work in the digital future. ABC News 24 will not just keep up with the speed of the news cycle, but bring a new depth of analysis 18 CORPORATE OVERVIEWBoard DIrectors' statementto it, helping to better inform the democratic process. It will increase the benefit derived from the ABC's existing news resources\u2014including local, national and international newsrooms and almost 1 000 journalists across the nation and the world. Regional Australia and ABC Open During the past year, Australians have continued to enjoy and appreciate content presented on ABC radio, television, online and mobile. At the same time, the audience's ability to participate with, rather than just consume, media has continued to increase. The Corporation has responded by continuing to make it easier for audiences to collaborate with the ABC, to share and contribute content. A growing range of voices and opinions has been incorporated into content presented by the ABC. By augmenting work produced by ABC staff with public contributions, ABC content has been strengthened, and by being more widely shared through the ABC, the impact of these contributions is enlarged. The ABC Open project, for which funding was received in the 2009-12 triennial funding agreement, is a new means through which people will be able to share reflections on regional Australia with the nation. The project expands upon the ABC's strong existing commitment to communities around the country through ABC Local Radio, and aims to encourage and develop creativity, self-expression and storytelling for the digital age in regional Australia. The ABC Open project is based upon projections of the future wider availability of faster broadband services in regional Australia. ABC multimedia producers will work with both individuals and groups to help develop digital storytelling skills that are already developed in urban Australia where fast broadband has now been available for some time. The Board has taken into account that no such service to regional Australia was available through commercial media organisations.A Sustainable Corporation The Board is committed to ensuring that the ABC is a strong and responsible corporate citizen and that it is financially sustainable. Progress has been made to improve the efficiency and sustainability of the ABC's operations. For the past three years, the ABC has adopted the Corporate Responsibility Index (CRI), operated in Australia by the St James Ethics Centre, as an external mechanism for benchmarking its performance. The ABC's CRI results have improved year-on-year, and in 2009, the Board was pleased to note the Corporation's achievement of a Platinum band score of 97.4%. In 2009-10, the ABC received a total of $932.1 million from government, including transmission funding and a single-year allocation to assist in the maintenance of the Corporation's asset base. It also received $185.4 million in revenue from other sources, including ABC Commercial, which faced a difficult retail environment. Board Appointments The Board would like to thank Dr Janet Albrechtsen, who retired from the Board during the year, for the contribution she made during her five-year term. Ms Cheryl Bart AO was welcomed to the ABC Board for a five-year term on 3 June 2010.As required under Section 8 of the ABC Act, the Board has continuously overseen the ABC's operations and accountabilities throughout the year to ensure the Corporation performs efficiently and with maximum benefit to the people of Australia. n CORPORATE OVERVIEW 19 1Our Values The ABC is a truly independent media organisation for all Australians.

It promises to be an exciting and rewarding time for both the Corporation and the public it serves. In a rapidly changing media environment, where new technologies are being embraced by audiences with astounding speed, the challenge facing the ABC is to maintain a strong connection with audiences and keep pace with their changing needs. With radio audiences experiencing significant growth in 2009-10, the ABC will look to consolidate and grow its presence in all of its target radio markets. The ABC has now made a year's progress into the long lead times required for television dramas, and audiences will soon see the first productions that are being made with the additional drama funding received in the 2009 Budget. A strong slate of new drama productions will begin rolling out on ABC television during the next 12 months. The ABC has a long and special relationship with rural and regional Australia. The Corporation has been assiduous in ensuring this connection is not just maintained, but developed. This involves taking account of the way people experience their media today\u2014the mix of contributing, collaborating and sharing that goes with consuming. The ABC Open project anticipates and makes provision for new ways of sharing and collaborating in digital storytelling that will soon be possible with the arrival of new broadband services in regional Australia. Experienced content creators will be working on ABC Open stories with people and communities across the country, guiding productions that will be appearing from September 2010 onwards. ABC Open will be a boost to creative life in regional and rural Australia, and another means through which the ABC can promote a better understanding of the realities of regional life. Australia's new 24-hour news service, ABC News 24, will be launched early in the second half of 2010. It will help to create a more informed Australian democracy, building on the trust and authority of ABC journalism that distinguishes it in a crowded news market. ABC News 24 also augments the ABC's role as Australia's town square, a place for civil debate open and available to every Australian free of charge, wherever they live. With the progress of these initiatives, the Corporation is at an exciting moment in Australia's cultural and civic life, a time of promise for the ABC in the digital age. n The ABC's focus will remain steadfastly on the needs and interests of the communities that it serves. CORPORATE OVERVIEW 27Outlook for the year ahead 128 CORPORATE OVERVIEWGood governance Ensure the ABC's independence, integrity and high standards. Strategic objectives The ABC's strategic direction in 2009-10 was guided by the ABC Corporate Plan 2007 -10. The Plan is framed around four strategic objectives, derived explicitly from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 , including the Charter (s.6). The ABC's performance against these objectives is reported at page 92. The ABC Corporate Plan 2007 -10 ended on 30 June 2010. In accordance with Part IV A of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 , a new corporate plan was developed. The re-named ABC Strategic Plan 2010 -13 will commence on 1 July 2010. Information about the new Plan is provided at page 87.Learning and growth Sustain and grow the ABC through high-quality leadership and an environment of responsibility and opportunity.Output and audiences To be recognised as the leading Australian public media space where people engage with issues and ideas.Value for money Deliver maximum benefit to the people of Australia through the effective and efficient delivery of ABC services.

Reporting the ABC's performance The ABC strives to maintain the highest standards in every aspect of its operations. The Board and the Executive Leadership Group set those standards in the ABC's Values, its Corporate Plan and in its divisional business planning; government sets them when funding is granted; and most significantly, audiences set them every time they turn to the ABC to be informed, engaged and entertained. The remainder of this report demonstrates the ABC's performance on all of those levels.

New television and radio channels offer greater variety to audiences, while richer and more diverse content is available online. Understanding audience behaviours and preferences is central to the ABC's content delivery strategy. The A.R. Rahman concert was broadcast live on ABC2 and internationally on the Australia Network, reflecting the ABC's commitment to broadcasting programs of cultural enrichment, and promoting the performing arts. Section2 Content performance Audience trends Radio Television News Online International audiences Consumer experiencesFor an enormous number of young people, triple j provides access to the music, events and information they want. For others, whose tastes and interests might be different, the ABC provides a diverse range of content nationally on Classic FM, Radio National and ABC NewsRadio. Local Radio is able to connect with audiences at a local level about the things that are relevant in their communities. Through its network of radio offerings, the ABC provides programming of both wide appeal and specialised interest. Audiences have ever-increasing opportunities to access ABC content, with online and mobile services growing in popularity. ABC services reached an estimated 73% of Australians each week via television, radio and online. 32 CONTENT PERFORMANCE1 N ewspoll, ABC Awareness and Usage Survey , June 2009 and July 2010 in combination with ratings data, people aged 18 years and over. 2 N ewspoll, ABC Appreciation Survey , June 2010, national random sample conducted by telephone, people aged 14 years and over.ThE ABC Is A lE AdE R in digital multi-channelling of television and digital radio, as well as the delivery of news, information and entertainment online and across a range of mobile devices. The past 12 months have seen the continued expansion of content offered on ABC iView and ABC News Online, as well as enhanced and new ABC lo cal sites, more content and applications for mobile phones and devices, and content distribution and sharing across multiple social media platforms. Against a backdrop of increasing audience fragmentation and greater competition on the local and international front, the ABC has maintained its combined national audience reach across television, radio and online at 73% (average weekly reach of ABC services). This is consistent with the result recorded in June 2009. 1 This result reflects the Corporation's success in delivering relevant programming and content to audiences through its television and radio channels and through a growing web of new and emerging technologies. Audiences continue to enjoy the ABC's mix of content, the distinctively Australian content offered across all ABC services and the consistent high-quality of ABC programs and content. Community satisfactionThe annual Newspoll ABC Appreciation Survey 2 provides valuable feedback, reflecting community perceptions and beliefs about the value of the ABC's contribution to Australian society. The 2010 survey was conducted nationally by telephone among a random sample of 1 905 respondents aged 14 years and over. The ABC Appreciation Survey has been conducted annually using the same methodology since its inception in 1998. The survey involves the community being asked their views on the quality of ABC Television, ABC Radio and ABC Online. Consistent with previous surveys, a large majority (81%) believe the quality of programming on ABC Television is \"good\", while half as many (44%) believe this about commercial television. Compared with 2008-09, at an overall level and by demography, there has been no significant change in attitudes concerning the quality of content on ABC Television. se ven in ten Australians believe the quality of programming on ABC Radio is \"good\". This result is consistent with the previous year. A pattern of more positive perceptions in the past couple of years is evident among both men and women and among people in the 14-24 and 35-49 age brackets. By comparison, approximately half (52%) of the population believe commercial radio offers good quality programming, a result consistent with previous tranches of research. Community perceptions about the quality of ABC and commercial radio are far closer than they are for television, reflecting the more fragmented and niche radio market, where audiences have a very wide choice of stations to listen to. Nine in ten ABC Online users believe the quality of content on the ABC website is \"good\", including one in three who say the quality of the website is \"very good\". Among frequent ABC Online users, the results are even more positive, with 95% of those who use the site at least once a week saying the quality of content is \"good\" and four in ten of this group saying the quality is \"very good\". The ABC Appreciation Survey also explores public perceptions about the ABC's performance in relation to specific aspects of the Corporation's Charter. The majority of Australians remain of the view that the ABC is doing \"a good job\" fulfilling its various Charter obligations. Compared with the previous year, the 2010 survey found small declines in the level of positive sentiment in two areas: broadcasting Audience trends2 CONTENT PERFORMANCE 33Independent research from Newspoll provides an overview of community attitudes and opinions about the ABC.Seven in ten Australians believe the quality of programming on ABC Radio is good. Nearly twice as many Australians believe the quality of ABC television programming is good compared to commercial television.34 CONTENT PERFORMANCEprograms that are different from commercial media and broadcasting programs that reflect cultural diversity. In both cases, the decrease marks a return to levels consistent with the 2008 survey. Year-on-year, there was a more pronounced decrease in the proportion of Australians who believe that the ABC does a good job of encouraging and promoting Australian performing arts. There was no significant change in programming that may have resulted in the decrease this year. The 2010 result is consistent with results recorded for this dimension in the mid-2000s. Over a longer timeframe, more Australians believe the ABC is doing a good job of being efficient and well managed, up from 69% in 2008 to 73% in 2010. This improvement in perception possibly reflects the ABC's budget management in parallel with its continuing expansion of services on television, radio and online. nAudience trends Independent research from Newspoll provides an overview of community attitudes and opinions about the ABC.Independent research from Newspoll provides an overview of community attitudes and opinions about the ABC.

The overall growth and success of abc.net.au is the responsibility of the Innovation di vision, in cooperation with the News, Television, Radio and Commercial di visions.abc.net.au In 2009-10, the number of people using ABC Online increased significantly. ABC Online averaged 25 million visits each month, an increase of 21% from the previous year. 35 Audience satisfaction with ABC Online also increased, with 91% of people believing the quality of content is \"good\" compared to 89% in 2008-09. 36 In 2009-10, the ABC undertook a number of projects to increase traffic and frequency of visits to ABC Online. In se ptember 2009, the interactive Black Saturday website was launched and has received numerous industry awards and critical acclaim. The site provides a comprehensive overview of the February 2009 Black sa turday bushfires that devastated parts of Victoria. The unique site interweaves a selection of quality user-generated content, professional media coverage from the time and official records with a series of video portraits of people affected by the fires. In de cember 2009, the opinion site The Drum was launched. The ABC also developed a content aggregation tool which allows online content from all of its output areas on a particular topic to be aggregated and presented in a single web portal. The first of these aggregation sites was ABC Environment, launched in de cember 2009. The tool was used to develop a number of new sites that will be deployed in 2010-11, including Religion/Ethics and Technology. Each site will be overseen by a specialised editor. In April 2010, the ABC developed and launched Bluebird , a ground-breaking, online \"alternate reality\" drama which played out over six weeks. Bluebird explored the science of geo-engineering and relied on the audience to unlock clues hidden across websites, blogs and YouTube video clips to unravel a story. The project attracted many visitors, and engaged with a small, but highly engaged group of \"players\" who immersed themselves in the project, cracking codes and competing for the highest score. The ABC delivers content and services to audiences on a huge range of platforms. abc.net.au is one of the cornerstones of the ABC's relationship with its audiences.Online 35 Webtrends July 2009 - June 2010. 36 Newspoll, ABC Appreciation Survey , June 2009 and July 2010.abc.net.au Mobile platforms so cial media platforms New projects58 CONTENT PERFORMANCEOnline \"Reach\" measures the total number of people who have visited abc.net.au over a specified timeframe. \"Visitors\" measures the number of unique browsers (not individual people) which have accessed ABC Online, identified by cookies. \"Visits\" measures the number of sessions on ABC Online.ABC Online reached an average 3.3 million unique users per month. Each month, the ABC averaged 25 million visits to abc.net.au.CONTENT PERFORMANCE 59 2Mobile platforms In 2009-10, the ABC expanded its suite of mobile services that provide audiences with access to ABC content. The ABC delivers optimised content and services for a range of smartphones including iPhone, Android and Blackberry devices. The most popular mobile service was the ABC iPhone application. At 30 June 2010, the application had been downloaded 800 000 times, and the service had attracted 150 000 visits each week. In June 2010, the ABC launched an application specifically for the iPad. Within the first two weeks there had been 30 000 downloads of the application, with users spending an average of 28 minutes per session each time they used the application. 2009-10 saw increasing demand for the ABC to make its content easily available to audiences at any time, or on any device they choose. While the ABC has been early to market with a number of successful mobile and web tablet services, growth in this area poses a number of challenges for the Corporation in terms of infrastructure and resources. ABC Innovation is exploring the most effective means of addressing these challenges. Social media platforms Over the last year, ABC activity on social media networks has been strong in terms of growth and reach, while at the same time improving in quality and value to the audience. At 30 June 2010, there were almost 300 000 followers of the 200 official ABC Twitter accounts, 260 000 fans of the 90 ABC Facebook accounts and a growing YouTube following of 17 500 subscribers. The Corporation continues to monitor and respond to the growth in the use of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. To date, it has experimented and been successful with social media accounts that represent personalities, programs, stations, networks, divisions, genres and campaigns. The ABC is working to refine and articulate its social media objectives, and to understand both its resourcing needs and its ongoing commitment to engaging with audiences in social media spaces. so cial media platforms offer the Corporation a tremendous opportunity to gain feedback, undertake research and build ongoing relationships with audiences. New projects ABC Innovation worked with other areas of the ABC, including ABC Archives, on a number of a pilot projects around education. The ABC collaborated with Education se rvices Australia to digitise and publish two collections of ABC archival video clips related to national curriculum subjects (environmental issues and post-war Indonesia). A separate project involved working with the New so uth Wales de partment of Education Centre for le arning Innovation and the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority to identify and map current ABC Television, Radio and Online content to the national science curriculum. These partnerships with educators demonstrate a new and valuable model for collaboration between the education and media sectors. In the year ahead, the ABC will be developing a disability website, with support from the de partment of Families, ho using, Community se rvices and Indigenous Affairs. The site will feature news and views of those living with a disability. In parallel, the ABC will conduct an audit of ABC Online's accessibility standards and make recommendations and improvements in this area. Critical to the success of ABC Online is the upgrade of the ABC's Web Content Management sy stem, which commenced in se ptember 2009. There was considerable progress during 2009-10 and the project is on target to migrate the first sites from the old system in late 2010. The upgrade will continue over the next two years and will include systems integration, content migration and staff training. n60 CONTENT PERFORMANCEThE ABC B ROAdC AsTs to the Asia-Pacific region through Australia Network and Radio Australia.

The Asia-Pacific News Centre (APNC) provides Australia Network and Radio Australia with news and analysis tailored for audiences in the region. The past year was the APNC's first full year of operation. Managed by ABC News, the APNC builds on the Corporation's long-standing Asia-Pacific expertise, with some 60 editorial staff, including reporters in the field.Australia Network Australia Network is Australia's international television and online service. It is currently available in an estimated 34 million homes in 44 countries across Asia, the Pacific and the Indian subcontinent. The television service supports Australian public diplomacy by providing trusted and impartial news and information, as well as showcasing the best of Australian culture, talent and innovation to an Asia-Pacific audience. It strives to accurately portray the nation as a democratic, culturally-diverse, environmentally-sensitive, successful trading nation. Australia Network distinguishes itself among international television competitors as a multi-genre provider that offers the best of Australian children's educational content, English-language learning, lifestyle, drama, documentary and news and current affairs. The programming strategy in the past year was aimed at improving its relevance to the target audience of Asia-Pacific \"internationalists\", by increasing output of Australian-made, accessible programming which presents an attractive window on Australian life, culture and business. Commissioned programming in 2009-10 included: P acific Pulse , a weekly magazine-style program reflecting contemporary life across the Pacific with a fresh, optimistic perspective that recognises the strengths, hopes, achievements and aspirations of the people in the Pacific. The program is presented from the region by Pacific islanders Tania Nugent and Clement Paligaru. Pacific Pulse stories were rebroadcast across the Pacific on local stations and used extensively as interstitials in the Australia Network schedule. Pacific Pulse will be rebroadcast in China by the sh anghai Media Group in 2010-11. M y Australia provides a look at Australia through the eyes of young people from the Asia-Pacific region.

In each episode, the show followed three international visitors as they explored Australian life. English-language learning programs were a key part of the 2009-10 programming schedule and were greatly appreciated by aspirational audiences in the region. They were supported by a suite of online offerings, including companion websites for popular programs such as Nexus, Study English, Living English and English Bites . These online resources were extremely popular\u2014including in countries such as China and Iran, where Australia Network is not currently broadcast\u2014and accounted for about 38% of all internet traffic to Australia Network. In the 12 months to April 2010, Australia Network experienced a 395% increase in vodcast downloads. Working closely with the APNC, Australia Network and Radio Australia provided multi-platform and multilingual rolling coverage of the devastating Pacific tsunami and su matra earthquake at the end of se ptember 2009, including reports from eyewitnesses and ABC correspondents on the scene. There was also detailed coverage of Australia's aid response. Audience research in Asia is limited to the sy novate PAX Cable and sa tellite su rvey. For the period ending March 2010, viewership of Australia Network had grown 9% on the previous year in an increasingly fragmented market. Increases were recorded in Jakarta, si ngapore and Bangkok, with modest increases in Taipei and ho ng Kong. Based on these results, Australia Network reached over 1.2 million viewers per month, excluding India. Taking account of the audience measured in India by TAM India's people meter service, the monthly viewing base exceeded two million. The current Australia Network contract between the ABC and the de partment of Foreign Affairs and Trade expires in August 2011. In June 2010, the Minister 62 CONTENT PERFORMANCEfor Foreign Affairs and Trade invited submissions from interested media industry parties regarding the future direction of Australia Network. The ABC expects an indication of the Government's intentions in October 2010. Radio Australia In 2009, Radio Australia celebrated 70 years of international broadcasting. From a simple shortwave radio service in 1939, Radio Australia has evolved into a multi-platform service providing content in eight languages: English, Indonesian, Mandarin, Tok Pisin (Pidgin), Vietnamese, Khmer, French and Burmese. The Burmese language service was launched in October 2009 and was the first new language service started by Radio Australia in more than 17 years. The addition of the service was prompted by the devastation and aftermath of Cyclone Nargis, the continued home detention of opposition leader Aung sa n su u Kyi and the scheduling of national elections in 2010. The service includes daily news and information, and is complemented by a Burmese-language website. Radio Australia's broadcast footprint covers the Asia- Pacific region, and includes a network of dedicated 24-hour FM transmitters, rebroadcasts on nearly 100 local radio stations, shortwave with a focus on the less developed parts of the region and satellite distribution across the footprint. Full transmission and distribution details are provided in Appendix 23 (page 223). Radio Australia offers a multilingual website, a wide variety of podcasts and blogs, a growing presence on social media services and news distributed to mobile phones. In 2009-10, the Radio Australia website received an average of 764 000 page views per month. This is consistent with performance in 2008-09, which is a positive result in a market which is becoming increasingly competitive. Radio Australia's popular bilingual English lessons include instruction and background information in regional languages: Chinese, Vietnamese, Indonesian and Khmer. They are available on-air, online as both audio and text and as downloadable podcasts. In 2009-10, 3.8 million podcasts of Radio Australia content were downloaded\u2014the majority being English-language lessons\u2014ranking them among the ABC's most popular podcasts. Radio Australia continued to have a significant impact in the Pacific Islands, particularly through programs tailored for Island audiences including Pacific News bulletins, the Pacific Beat current affairs program and the In the Loop talk and music show. In de cember 2009, Radio Australia had an average weekly audience reach of 32.2% in the main urban centres of Papua New Guinea, the so lomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji and sa moa.37 Radio Australia's largest cross-platform activity continues to be in Pacific through the Pacific Break music competition, searching for the best unsigned original musicians that the Pacific has to offer. Now in its third year, Pacific Break also included television coverage by Australia Network and online participation. Pacific Break 's 2009 winner was a Papua New Guinea musician whose prize was travel to Vanuatu to perform live at the Fest Napuan Pacific Music Festival. Pacific Break was awarded \"Most Creative Marketing st rategy\" by the Association of International Broadcasters in their annual awards in lo ndon in November 2009. For the first time, Radio Australia also had a presence at FIFO (Festival International du Film Oceanien), the annual Pacific film festival hosted in French Polynesia in January 2010. This event presented the French Radio Australia service with the opportunity to cooperate with France's overseas broadcasting services, and led to the ABC being invited to play a bigger role in next year's FIFO.

International Projects The ABC, through its International Projects unit, works to support the development in the Asia-Pacific region of robust media institutions that operate in the public interest. It is funded externally on a project basis, with some 25 staff (including locally-engaged staff). Staff are located in Cambodia, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu, and there is a support team in Australia. International Projects offers assistance in the form of strategic advice, training and mentoring, technical support and secondments. The core goal of these activities is to increase demand for good governance and support communications for development in partner countries. This goal aligns with the strategic direction of the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), the principal source of funding for International Projects. In 2009-10, International Projects continued major programs with Papua New Guinea's National Broadcasting Corporation, the Vanuatu Broadcasting and Television Corporation, media organisations in the Solomon Islands and Cambodia's state broadcaster, Radio National Kampuchea. The Cambodia project, which included the introduction of talkback radio, has been extended until 2011, having attracted funding from the World Bank as well as from AusAID. International Projects also managed a number of smaller projects, including a program of support to broadcasters across 14 Pacific countries. The unit also commenced a program of support for Vietnam Television which began in 2009 and will be completed in late 2010.

The ABC depends on skilled and experienced people who are responsible day and night for making content, broadcasting content and everything in-between. 72 SYSTEMS AND SERVICES PERFORMANCECONSISTENT AND RIgORO uS editorial standards are critical to the ABC's ability to meet its legislative obligations and public expectations. The ABC Editorial Policies are the Corporation's leading standards and a day-to-day reference for makers of content for radio, television, online and print. They give practical shape to statutory obligations in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 , in particular the obligations to: provide services of a high standard, maintain independence and integrity, and ensure that the gathering and presentation of news and information is accurate and impartial according to the recognised standards of objective journalism. The ABC Editorial Policies set out the ABC's self- regulatory standards and how the Corporation enforces them. They are also the source for the ABC Code of Practice , which the ABC notifies to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). The ABC Editorial Policies are applied throughout the Corporation and are overseen by the Director of Editorial Policies. The Director's four main functions are: to advise, verify, and review in relation to compliance with the ABC Editorial Policies generally, and to oversee the ABC's central audience liaison and complaints handling system. AdviseIn order to ensure clarity and consistency in the interpretation of the ABC Editorial Policies , the Director of Editorial Policies advises the Managing Director and other Directors. The content areas have their own editorial policy specialists and day-to-day queries follow the longstanding procedure for upward referral. The Director of Editorial Policies also develops training and guidance material and provides a bi-monthly staff bulletin.Verify Quality Assurance projects are designed and implemented each year to check whether the ABC is meeting the high standards it sets for itself. The projects assess samples of content that have already been broadcast or published. They do not deal in any way with content that is yet to be broadcast or published; that is a quality control responsibility which properly rests with the content divisions, subject to the editorial control of the Managing Director. The quality assurance projects are also separate from the ABC's system for handling formal complaints about particular items of content. The aim of the quality assurance work is to design and test fair and rigorous methodologies for projects that can then be undertaken regularly and cost effectively by the content areas themselves. The purpose is to contribute to accountability and to the continuous improvement of ABC content. In 2009-10, projects included: an assessment of the impartiality of a sample of television news coverage of the Federal government's second financial stimulus package; early steps in developing a way for the ABC to undertake, routinely and at manageable cost, assessments of the impartiality of its coverage of elections, based on reliable qualitative research techniques; compressing a range of materials into a short guide to how to differentiate between analysis and opinion content; and turning the lessons learned in previous years' projects on accuracy in news into a manual for content-makers to use to self-assess the accuracy of samples of their work.Editorial standards The astonishing growth of social media\u2014such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter\u2014poses complex and still-evolving policy challenges for all large media organisations.3 SYSTEMS AND SERVICES PERFORMANCE 73Review Self-regulation Framework ReviewIn August 2009, the ABC Board adopted the recommendations of a review of the ABC's self-regulation framework undertaken in 2008-09 by the Director of Editorial Policies with the Chairman, Maurice Newman. The ABC Editorial Policies are part of the larger framework, which includes training, dealing with audience responses, formal complaints handling, remedies and penalties, appropriate data collection and feedback through the Corporation of the results of self-regulation activities to promote both effective accountability and continuous quality improvement. The primary recommendations of the review were: 1. Revise the ABC Editorial Policies to distil key enforceable standards and restate them for an era of technological change 2. Streamline the complaints-handling system to make it more efficient and reinforce both accountability and continuous quality improvement 3. gradually increase opportunities for audiences to respond directly to content areas, using technologies better and reducing bureaucracy 4. Collect better data about how self-regulation works in the ABC and create better feedback loops to use the data to reinforce accountability and improve quality 5. Increase training in awareness and application of editorial standards. The review recognised that effective implementation of the recommendations will require commitment across all content areas. The final report of the review was made public on the ABC's website. Revising the ABC Editorial PoliciesThe ABC Editorial Policies have been updated periodically over the past several decades. The swiftly-evolving media environment requires them to be continuously reviewed and updated. In 2009-10, in accordance with the recommendations of the Self-regulation Framework Review, the Director of Editorial Policies led a thorough revision of the ABC Editorial Policies , with a particular focus on adapting to converging technologies. The revision process and preparations for the gradual implementation of the other recommendations of the Self-regulation Framework Review were ongoing as at 30 June 2010. As part of implementing one of the recommendations\u2014a renewed emphasis on training in editorial standards\u2014an agreement was reached with the British Broadcasting Corporation to allow authorised ABC users access to the BBC College of Journalism Online, which contains a large amount of material on editorial standards which are similar to, though not the same as, the ABC's. The BBC online resources augment the ABC's own online and face-to-face training. Use of Social MediaSocial media such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are third-party platforms for ABC content, and ABC staff use social media for official and private purposes. The Director of Editorial Policies, in consultation with content areas, distilled the ABC's policies into a Use of Social Media policy that is designed to allow the Corporation to maximise the benefits of social media while minimising the risks. The policy identifies four essential standards to guide ABC employees and contractors in their use of social media: 1. Do not mix the professional and the personal in ways likely to bring the ABC into disrepute 2. Do not undermine your effectiveness at work 3. Do not imply ABC endorsement of your personal views 4. Do not disclose confidential information obtained through work. n74 SYSTEMS AND SERVICES PERFORMANCEInfrastructure and operations ThE PAST YEAR has been significant for the Operations group. A continued focus on efficiency and innovation in the delivery of ABC services to audiences has included the introduction of new technology, production workflows and operational efficiencies. TechnologyIn 2009-10, a significant area of focus for the ABC was the development of an overall technology strategy. The Director of Technology led an ABC Information, Communication and Technology (ICT) Strategy Scoping Exercise, during which senior ABC staff were interviewed to identify key priorities and themes for a new ICT Strategy, as well as strategic disciplines that will improve the ABC's technology capability. The ABC ICT Strategy will address those priorities and themes and will be launched early in 2010-11. In April 2010, an ICT Executive Committee was established. Membership of the ICT Executive Committee includes the Managing Director (Chair), Chief Operating Officer, Director of Technology and all content Directors. This Committee will be responsible for monitoring the effectiveness of the ABC ICT Strategy and governance framework. Reflecting the importance of networked broadcast equipment in the ABC, and having regard to the changing technical environment, the Technology Division commenced work on streamlining the delivery of technical support services. Preparations began for the introduction of a common technology fault and maintenance management system across broadcast and information technology. In 2010, the ABC reintroduced the annual Women in Broadcast Technology Scholarships, focusing on offering scholarships to women studying electrotechnology in the TAFE sector. The Scholarships aim to increase the number of female recruits into technical roles. As well as a cash prize, scholarship winners are employed temporarily on a structured work-experience program.Transmission and distribution of ABC services A continuing area of focus for the ABC in 2009-10 has been the government's timetable for conversion to exclusively digital television in Australia by the end of 2013. In 2009-10, the ABC extended the reach of its digital television services to 97.3% of the Australian population (see Appendix 21, page 209). On 30 June 2010, the Mildura region became the first area where analog television services were switched off; all television services in Mildura are now digital-only. In July 2009, digital radio services were successfully introduced in the five major metropolitan markets. The digital conversion of the links that carry ABC Local Radio services from studios to transmitters was completed in 2009-10. This digital network, known as the Apollo network, covers some 200 sites including studios, transmitters and sporting venues. In late 2009, technical issues with the new network resulted in a number of outages and programming difficulties. The network service provider, Telstra, analysed the faults and upgraded the network to better reflect the real-time nature of radio broadcasting. The upgrades have significantly improved the reliability of the network. The Communications Networks Division continued to monitor areas where there had been concerns about transmission performance to ensure the ABC's service provider, Broadcast Australia, improved the reliability of ABC services. Areas of focus included the performance of radio services in Latrobe Valley in Victoria, Rockhampton in Queensland, Adelaide in South Australia, and inland outback radio services in the Northern Territory. The \"engine room\" of the ABC is the Operations Group. It provides a range of vital services and support functions across the Corporation.SYSTEMS AND SERVICES PERFORMANCE 75 3ABC Distribution and Transmission Network aggregated performance 2009-10 No. of ABC Distribution Broadcast Australia Total Network Total \"On-Air\" Transmitters Network Transmission Network Availability Availability (See Note 1) (See Note 2) (See Note 3) (See Note 4) 2009-10 2008-09 Target 2009-10 2008-09 2009-10 2008-09 2009-10 2008-09 ABC Service % % % % % % % % % Classic FM 68 99.98 99.98 99.83 99.89 100.00 - 99.33 - 99.93 - State NSW 256 99.80 99.90 99.80 99.85 99.85 99.67 Notes : 1. ABC Distribution Network : The ABC distribution network ensures programs are delivered from ABC studio to transmitters throughout Australia. Program distribution is achieved through the use of satellite and terrestrial fibre and copper networks provided by various telecommunications carriers. Contracts with these telecommunications carriers have been negotiated to be largely consistent with the ABC's transmission targets. The above results represent the aggregated performance of the telecommunications carriers over the period. 2. Broadcast Australia Transmission Network (ABC Transmission Provider) : Transmission network performance is reported by Broadcast Australia as a contract deliverable. Performance of transmission services, in general, were broadly in line with expectations. 3. Total Network Availability shows the impact of all outages on the overall network : The above chart reflects all outages across the distribution and transmission networks regardless of the source or cause of the fault. The vast majority of reported outages were not in fact \"off air\" occurrences, but reduced levels of service, such as lower transmission power. Overall analog radio, analog television and digital television networks performed in line with expectations. ABC Transmission Network Services has identified a range of faults not previously included in the reporting process and has adjusted the reporting procedures to reflect these incidences. This change in the reporting structure has led to an adjustment in the reported performance. It should be noted there may not have been a significant decline against previous periods and that the new reporting structure now more accurately reflects the actual network performance. 4. Total \"On-Air\" Availability : The figures show \"off-air\" occurrences where no level of service continued to be provided throughout faults and maintenance activity. On-air availability improved marginally over all, compared to the previous year. The exception was Tasmania, which was below target. The impact of faults at the Mt Barrow, NE Tasmania transmission site (the parent service for many translators in Northern Tasmania), accounts for most of the decline in performance. The service provider has completed minor capital works to improve performance at this site. The ABC is closely monitoring its performance. 76 SYSTEMS AND SERVICES PERFORMANCEProduction facilities In 2009-10, the ABC entered into a joint venture with WIN TV to build a new, digital play-out centre for television presentation called Media hub. The facility has bought significant efficiency and operational benefits to ABC broadcast operations through the adoption of fully-automated and centralised television presentation operations. Media hub has the capacity to deliver the ABC's multi-channels, with local state and territory breakout capability and the ability to handle multiple live broadcasts. It is a tapeless environment, configured to deliver 150 channels with scalable capacity available for over 300 channels. The facility has the capacity to store over 12 000 hours of content and 150 terabytes of data. Television play-out for ABC1, ABC2 and ABC3 was progressively transitioned to Media hub in the last months of the financial year. Media hub operates off-site in Ingleburn in western Sydney.In 2009-10, the Broadcast Operations and Capital Works units designed and built a fully-automated, tapeless television play-out facility or \"digital media gateway\" at the ultimo Centre in Sydney to support the launch of ABC3. Following the migration of ABC3 services to Media hub in April 2010, the digital media gateway has become the point of delivery of all content for play-out to Media hub. It is also a disaster recovery play-out facility as backup for Media hub. The ABC continued to implement recommendations from the Production Review, consolidating the file-based production process for news acquisition, editing, production and distribution. The process of automating news studios also continued. By October 2009, all 7pm News and local Stateline programs were being produced from automated studios, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of operational person hours required for each program. Desktop editing facilities and training were introduced into each television newsroom. Journalists were trained to edit simple stories from their desks, freeing up experienced editors for more complex work. New Digital Electronic News gathering vehicles were built and supplied to Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and Queensland to augment live news coverage of breaking events. Available labour and facilities spare capacity were sold to the market where they were used for the production of Network Ten's Rove, Talkin' 'bout Your Generation and Good News Week and Foxtel's AFL coverage. The ABC's external hire activities generated $6 million in gross revenue in 2009-10, providing a net return of $2.3 million of new funds. This was returned to the ABC for investment in production of content. External hire activities represent 2% of total labour and facility hours. nInfrastructure and operations The Ignite studio automation system has increased the efficiency of news production.3 SYSTEMS AND SERVICES PERFORMANCE 77ABC people IN 2009-10, the ABC employed 5 442 people across every State and Territory, equivalent to 4 557 full-time employees. The majority of those employees were directly involved in content-making. The workforce comprised 51% men and 49% women (the same as 2008-09). Indigenous employment levels increased from 1.2% to 1.4%. ABC ValuesSince the launch of the ABC Values\u2014Integrity, Respect, Collegiality and Innovation\u2014in March 2009, the People and Learning Division has engaged in activities aimed at encouraging a values-based culture in the ABC. These activities included policy and system enhancement and the development of the Our Values at Work program, which will be implemented in 2010-11. The program will provide resources including a fifteen-minute DVD featuring ABC stories that exemplify the ABC Values, an intranet site and a handbook for managers. The resources focus on engaging managers and staff, and assisting them to develop a shared understanding of the ABC Values. ABC Values have also been included in staff induction programs. In 2010, the Corporation introduced the ABC Spark Awards, an initiative to promote innovation, one of the ABC's Values. Jointly managed by the People and Learning and Innovation Divisions, this initiative provided staff across the Corporation with the opportunity to suggest ideas in three categories: content, business, and community. More than 400 entries were received. Winners will be announced in 2010-11. The success of the ABC depends on the skills, talents and commitment of its workforce. \"Full-time equivalent\" positions account for all employees, including those who work part-time or have other flexible working arrangements.The ABC employed the full-time equivalent of 4 557 people. 0 500 1 000 1 500 2 000 2 500 3 000 3 500Retail Staf fTechnologistSenior ExecutiveProgram job gr oupThe ABC employs staff across five broad categories, each of which perform an important function in the ABC's operations.66% of ABC employees were directly engaged in content making.78 SYSTEMS AND SERVICES PERFORMANCERecruiting and creating opportunities In February 2010, the first phase of an online eRecruitment system commenced with the launch of an enhanced ABC Careers website (abc.net.au/careers) and internal careers site. This was the first step towards a new way of attracting and recruiting applicants online for vacancies within the ABC. Phase one focused on core features designed to maximise the candidate experience and improve the efficiency and visibility of administration and processing functions. The second phase, which includes additional functionality to further streamline the recruitment process, and utilises social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, is scheduled for 2010-11. A number of strategies aimed at increasing Indigenous employment levels were implemented across all Divisions. In July 2009, six Indigenous students from around NSW were awarded the inaugural ABC School to Work Indigenous Scholarships. This initiative, in conjunction with the NSW Department of Education, aims to encourage ABC people Distribution of staff by division shows how the ABC is allocating its resources within its internal structure.The distribution of staff by region demonstrates the ABC's localism, as well as the spread of employment opportunities offered by the ABC.More than 80% of ABC staff were employed in content making divisions.The ABC employed staff in every State and Territory . 3 SYSTEMS AND SERVICES PERFORMANCE 79young Indigenous people to attain their hSC and to build relationships between the ABC and potential job applicants. In addition, five Indigenous internships across the News, Radio and Technology Divisions have been offered to tertiary students. In May 2010, the ABC commenced the national roll- out of the Indigenous Culture in the ABC program, comprising a workshop and extensive e-learning component. Following pilot sessions in South Australia, the program was rolled-out in the Australian Capital Territory. The program will be delivered nationally over the next two years. The Indigenous Culture in the ABC program is a key component of the ABC's Reconciliation Action Plan , endorsed by the ABC Board in 2009 (see page 108). Managing conditions of employment at the ABCIn April 2010, the ABC initiated bargaining with the Community and Public Sector union and the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, as bargaining representatives for employees, for a new ABC Employment Agreement. The new Agreement will replace the existing agreement, the operation of which had been extended to 1 July 2010. In preparation for the negotiations, People and Learning conducted an extensive consultation and planning process to determine strategic priorities. Priorities for the ABC included further streamlining processes, working more efficiently, developing and rewarding a high-performance culture and providing the organisation with greater flexibility through changes in forms of employment. The ABC sought a wages outcome that was both fair and reasonable for staff and affordable and sustainable for the Corporation. Negotiations commenced in April 2010 and extended beyond the nominal expiry date of the Agreement. An Agreement will be put to staff for vote early in 2010-11. Throughout the year, People and Learning continued to work closely with Divisions to implement major organisational changes, including those resulting from the Production Review, the Web Content Management System, the Continuous News Centre, and the transition to Media hub. Health and safety The ABC implemented a number of initiatives in 2009-10 to ensure the continued improvement of its Occupational health and Safety (O hS) management system. These initiatives included implementing the ABC's health and Safety Management Arrangements, codifying the framework for O hS consultation within the ABC, and developing a three-year O hS Business Plan to enhance and deliver O hS practices throughout the Corporation. Delivery of O hS training programs specific to divisional O hS risk and hazardous operations included Fatigue Management, Risk Assessment, Online Ergonomics, Manual handling and O hS Induction. The News Division continued to deliver a Trauma Awareness Program to support staff whose work includes covering and dealing with potentially traumatic incidents. The ABC's Worker's Compensation Premium increased by 139% for 2010-11. This was partly a result of incurred, but not reported data from 2008-09. The O hS unit developed strategies to promote improved injury prevention and management over the year. Detailed information about the ABC's OhS performance is provided in Appendix 13 (page 184). n80 SYSTEMS AND SERVICES PERFORMANCEStrategy and Governance The Corporate Strategy and governance unit provides advice to the ABC Board and management on technological innovations and world-wide trends in broadcasting and online services to inform decision-making. The unit also provides strategic support, analysis and advice in relation to the ABC's external reporting and corporate governance activities. It coordinates corporate planning and cross-divisional policy work, produces the Annual Report and leads or participates in major corporate projects. During the year, the unit also developed the ABC Strategic Plan 2010-13 . Corporate Strategy and governance has a central role in the ABC's regulatory response activities. In 2009-10, it wrote or coordinated submissions to various government Departments and the ACMA. The unit also plays a key role in preparing the ABC's triennial funding submissions. Audience ResearchIn 2009-10, the ABC subscribed to a range of quantitative services to measure audiences. The Corporation also commissioned a range of quantitative and qualitative research to help inform strategy, programming, scheduling and marketing decisions, and to gauge audience attitudes to its services. Information about the ABC's audiences in 2009-10 can be found in Section 2, Audience Experiences (pages 31 to 69).Marketing Corporate Marketing within the ABC involves managing the ABC brand, its partnerships with other Australian organisations, corporate and community events and cross-divisional marketing needs. The ABC obtains advice from its specialist digital marketing staff on its email and digital marketing services, as well as on social media. ABC BrandThe ABC brand embodies the relationship between the Corporation and its audiences. The brand \"custodian\" for the ABC is the newly-created ABC Marketing Executive group which is led by the Director of Strategy and Marketing and consists of heads of Marketing and key stakeholders from all content divisions. The group meets monthly to discuss divisional and corporation-wide marketing priorities, activities and cross-promotional opportunities. In 2009-10, the group developed the ABC brand vision: \"To enrich the lives of every Australian, every day\". From the brand vision, the Marketing Executive group developed the ABC \"DNA\"\u2014benefits, values, attributes, associations\u2014which laid the foundations for the ABC's Strategic Marketing Plan. A key focus of the Plan is brand invigoration, encouraging Australians to engage with the ABC in more ways, more often. Launching in 2010-11, a new brand campaign invites audiences to \"enter\" the world of the ABC. The objective of the campaign is to re-energise the ABC brand, increase perceptions of the Corporation as innovative and a multi-platform broadcaster, encourage more Australians to engage with the ABC, and to increase awareness of the ABC's online content. Corporate functions The ABC's corporate functions are performed by specialist groups across a number of Divisions. 3 SYSTEMS AND SERVICES PERFORMANCE 81Marketing events The ABC held a number of internal and external corporate events during the year, including the Sydney Media 140, TEDx Sydney, the annual ABC showcase at Parliament house in Canberra and the 2009 Boyer Lecture presented by general Peter Cosgrove. The ABC Exhibition Trailer visited 14 community events, including the Australia Day Broadcast from hyde Park with 702 ABC Sydney, the Darwin and Alice Springs Royal Shows, Womad in Adelaide, the Sydney Royal Easter Show, the Lismore Show, the Bega Festival, Tropfest Junior and the Apollo Bay Music Festival. The Corporate Marketing unit organises and manages public tours of many of its facilities. Tours of the ABC ultimo Centre in Sydney attracted 7 173 visitors in 2009-10. A total of 4 004 school students from different schools and 3 109 seniors from community groups visited the centre. Currently there are 17 volunteer tour guides involved in the ultimo Tours program. Communications A focus of the ABC's communications strategy over the past year has been to advance the ABC's position as an innovative, publicly-valued organisation in a fast-moving media environment. This has included planning the ABC Showcase at Parliament house in March 2010 and co-ordinating the responses to regular hearings of Senate Estimates Committees. The Communications Division played a key role in laying the groundwork for the Managing Director's speeches in 2010-11, and in navigating a path for the ABC through the robust debates that followed. Topics canvassed included the changing media landscape in the A.N. Smith Memorial Lecture at Melbourne university in October 2009; international diplomacy in the Bruce Allen Memorial Lecture at Macquarie university in November 2009; the value The ABC's interactive Exhibition Trailer travels the country showcasing ABC products and services. The Trailer features a small studio, interactive games, displays and online tours of ABC studios, and can also be used as a stage for live concerts and Outside Broadcasts.82 SYSTEMS AND SERVICES PERFORMANCEof public broadcasting in the CBA Lecture in London in September 2009 and again in South Africa at the CBA Conference in April 2010; and the ABC's newsgathering agenda at the Melbourne Press Club in February. As commercial media business models experience stress with the impact of economic and technological changes, the role of the ABC, and public broadcasting generally, has continued to be debated loudly and persistently. Communications played its customary role in co- ordinating the ABC's response on a range of policy fronts, most notably working with the Strategy and governance unit to develop the submission to the Federal government's Digital Dividend green Paper and in working with the Chief Operating Officer on Budget preparations. The latter resulted in a Cabinet decision to maintain the ABC's capital appropriation for another year. State and Territory DirectorsReporting to the Director of Communications, the State and Territory Directors represent the ABC at a local level across Australia, playing an important external role in communicating the ABC's strategic objectives and in liaising with stakeholders, as well as building relationships with local communities and providing a central point of contact. Internally, the Directors oversee the business of the ABC in their regions to promote and facilitate whole-of-business and cross-divisional outcomes in line with strategic goals. Accommodation is a key directorial responsibility. The Queensland State Director is Project Co-ordinator for the new Brisbane building, which will open in 2011-12. The Victorian State Director leads the Melbourne Accommodation Project, which is planning and developing new, integrated premises for the ABC in Victoria.Corporate functions ABC Chairman Maurice Newman turns the first sod on the site of the ABC's new Brisbane premises accompanied by (l-r) Queensland State Director Mike McGowan, Queensland Symphony Orchestra CEO Patrick Pickett and Architect Richard Kirk. Construction of the facility, located at South Bank in the arts and cultural centre of Brisbane, began in May 2010.SYSTEMS AND SERVICES PERFORMANCE 83 3State and Territory Directors undertake a range of strategic project work and chair or make significant contributions to a range of ABC national bodies, including the Occupational health and Safety Committee, the Corporate Responsibility Reference group, Leadership Alumni Committee and the Election Coverage Review Committee. At a local level, each State and Territory Director chairs the State Leadership team, the Occupational health and Safety Committee, the Emergency Co- ordination team, the Workplace giving Committee, the green Futures Committee and the Indigenous Working group. The Directors were involved in or facilitated a range of activity and reviews in their branches, including the self-regulation review; the review of the ABC Editorial Policies ; local strategic planning and promotion of innovative activity such as the Spark Awards; NAIDOC activities and Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives. To enhance relationships with local communities, State and Territory Directors participated in or chaired more than 30 external advisory committees, boards, trusts and foundations and attended hundreds of events and functions. They maintained strong partnerships between the ABC and emergency organisations and police, ensuring that protocols are in place for emergency broadcasting and business continuity.Legal ABC Legal provides a comprehensive range of legal services to the Corporation including pre-publication advice on a 24-hour, seven-days-per-week basis; conducting litigation on behalf of the Corporation; providing advice on contractual and rights issues, regulatory regimes and the statutory obligations of ABC Divisions; and providing advice on legal aspects of policy issues and developing submissions to parliament, government and other organisations about law reform. ABC Legal was involved in contracting with Optus for VAST (Viewer Access Satellite Television), a new satellite service to provide digital television to viewers in Australia who are unable to receive terrestrial television services when analog transmission ceases. Other significant contracts related to major comedy and drama projects, including The Gruen Transfer, Outland, Angry Boys, I Rock and Bed of Roses . In 2009-10, ABC Legal provided pre-publication advice on a number of controversial programs, including for Four Corners and Australian Story . Legal continued its media law training program, which is aimed at minimising the ABC's exposure to legal proceedings by delivering a series of specialised media law workshops for content makers, covering topics such as contempt of court and defamation.

CORPORATE PERFORMANCE 85 Governance and sustainability Section4 Corporate performance Corporate governance Performance against the ABC Corporate Plan Government outcomes Reconciliation Action Plan ABC Advisory Council Sustainability reportThe ABC has a responsibility to the Australian people to not only deliver great media experiences, but to do it in a manner which is socially, environmentally and financially responsible. To meet those expectations, the ABC maintains high standards of corporate governance. MediaHub centralises the ABC's presentation and Master Control Room facilities. Using state-of-the-art technology, the ABC's content can be switched and routed from studios, outside broadcast vans and overseas news feeds, creating increased efficiency. As Australia's primary public broadcaster, the ABC aims to broadcast to all Australians, and to tell Australian stories. Through ABC Open, it will be able to deliver more locally-focused information, as well as enable regional communities to create and share content. In doing so, the ABC aims to provide a service that is both local and universal.86 CORPORATE PERFORMANCECorporate governance ThE ABC B O ARd A Nd M ANAGEMENT a pply a corporate governance framework that aims to balance the ABC's performance as a creative media organisation, on the one hand, and its need to comply with the formal obligations of a statutory corporation on the other. Throughout 2009-10, the ABC gave particular attention to editorial quality assurance, self-regulation and building a values-based organisational culture. ABC corporate objectives, strategies, policies and activities derive from the requirements of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 (\"ABC Act\"). In particular, Section 6 of the Act\u2014the ABC Charter\u2014outlines the functions of the Corporation and Section 8 lays out the duties of the Board (see Appendix 1, page 172). The Act expressly provides for both the editorial and administrative independence of the Corporation, thereby investing the Board with considerable discretion. In acknowledgement of that independence, the ABC accepts the obligation to meet the highest standards of public accountability.Governance and management processes Board Governance The ABC Board held seven meetings during 2009-10.In June 2010, the Board also attended the annual strategy retreat with the Executive Leadership Group. Janet Albrechtsen's term as a di rector expired on 23 February 2010. On 3 June 2010, Ms Cheryl Bart AO was appointed to the Board for a five-year term.The Audit and Risk Committee met on six occasions. The Editorial Policies Committee and the hu man Resources Committee did not meet during 2009-10, as all pertinent matters were dealt with by the full Board. The roles and responsibilities of the Board are described on page 12. Further information about the ABC Board and its Committees is provided in Appendices 5 and 6 (page 178). Management ProcessesThe Managing di rector chairs a monthly meeting of the Executive Leadership Group, comprising divisional di rectors and the di rectors of specialist support units reporting to him. This group also convenes briefly each Monday morning, holds a two-day off-site strategic planning session in February each year and joins with the Board for an annual two-day strategy retreat. The Content Leadership Group meets monthly to focus on content development issues, including cross-platform opportunities, audience trends and branding. The Chief Operating Officer chairs the third monthly forum, the Operations Support Group, made up of operations support divisions such as ABC Resources, Communication Networks, Business Services, People and Learning and Corporate Strategy and Marketing. Online activities are coordinated by a monthly Online Executive Group, led by the di rector of Innovation and consisting of the di visional heads responsible for online content and services. Internal AuditGroup Audit provides an independent and objective audit and advisory service which is designed to add value and improve the Corporation's operations. Group Audit helps the ABC to achieve its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes.The ABC successfully engaged with Government on a series of major digital policy milestones and decisions in 2009-10 to ensure that the needs of national broadcasters are adequately taken into account.CORPORATE PERFORMANCE 87 4In 2009-10, Group Audit completed scheduled audits which included comprehensive, compliance, information technology, project assurance and follow-up audits. Group Audit also performed unscheduled reviews at the specific request of management and continued to use technology to undertake continuous auditing and monitoring of transactional data. As in previous years, Group Audit used a combination of in-house staff and external companies to provide the most appropriate industry experience and technical expertise. Group Audit also provided advice and guidance to ABC management and staff on good governance, risk management, policies, and controls, as well as advice on a number of projects and initiatives of the Corporation. Further information is provided in Appendix 6 (page 178). Fraud ControlIn 2009-10, the ABC continued to implement its Fraud Control Plan 2008-10 to ensure the Corporation met the requirements of the Commonwealth Fraud Control Guidelines. The Managing di rector is satisfied that the ABC has in place appropriate procedures and processes relating to fraud prevention, detection, investigation, reporting and data collection, and that these comply with the Commonwealth Fraud Control Guidelines. Risk ManagementThe ABC's Business Continuity program operates within the Corporation's broader governance and risk management framework to enhance emergency coordination, crisis management and business continuity planning and processes. The ABC has completed the three-year project to implement recommendations from an external risk management benchmarking review conducted in 2006, which involved development and implementation of the ABC's Risk Management Policy and Framework. An Executive Risk Committee was established to provide a forum for senior managers to discuss and respond to risk management issues, from both a whole-of-Corporation perspective and within each division. Comprehensive risk profiling and training exercises were undertaken, and risk profiles are developed on an annual basis. The Comcover 2010 Risk Management Benchmarking survey of 130 Government agencies rated the Corporation's risk management practices as \"structured\" (scoring 7.5 out of 10). This is a strong result compared to the average maturity level of both Agencies Overall and of the ABC's Peer Group. Corporate Strategy SettingSection 31A of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 requires the Board to develop corporate plans that set out the strategic direction for the ABC. du ring the course of 2009-10, the ABC developed a new three-year Strategic Plan for the period 2010-13. Work on the Strategic Plan 2010-13 began after the annual Board and management off-site planning event held on 15-16 June 2009 and reflects the thinking emerging from that event. The Plan acknowledges the challenges and opportunities for the ABC created by the digital revolution sweeping through global media. The life of the Plan corresponds to the period within which Australia will substantially switch from analog to digital television broadcasting. Similarly, it is expected to witness a rise in access to high-speed and mobile broadband. To continue to meet public expectations of its role as Australia's primary national public broadcaster in this changing environment, the ABC will continue to build its capabilities as a digital broadcaster, deliver great media experiences to its audiences and ensure its sustainability for the future. The Strategic Plan 2010-13 commits the ABC to striving to maintain its leadership position as an innovative and independent media organisation serving the needs of all Australians. It sets out six high-level strategic goals for the ABC: Audience-focused \u2014to provide a range of media experiences to meet the needs and expectations of diverse audiences High-quality \u2014to consistently deliver content which reflects the ABC's commitment to quality, independence and high editorial standards Innovative \u2014to pursue new ideas, opportunities and partnerships, and grow its capabilities for the futureValues-based \u2014to demonstrate ABC Values in every aspect of its workEfficient \u2014to maximise the efficient and effective use of resources88 CORPORATE PERFORMANCEResponsible \u2014to be visible and active in the community, setting high standards of social, environmental and regulatory responsibility. Each of these goals is further articulated through a set of specific strategic priorities and performance indicators. The Strategic Plan 2010-13 will come into effect from 1 July 2010. Meeting the ABC's Reporting Obligations Report against the ABC Corporate Plan The ABC Corporate Plan 2007-10 sets out Objectives and Key di rections for the Corporation. Performance reporting against the Corporate Plan occurs at three levels: O verall effectiveness of the Corporation in delivering public benefit to the Australian community\u2014measured through the results of the annual Newspoll ABC Appreciation Survey (see page 35) K ey Result Areas in relation to each of the four high-level corporate objectives laid out in the Plan\u2014specific performance measures intended to highlight the most relevant factors of success (see page 92) P erformance Targets\u2014the achievement or non- achievement of specific initiatives intended to improve the ABC's performance (see page 96). Compliance Reporting In June 2008, the de partment of Finance and de regulation issued Finance Circular No. 2008/5 relating to Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act (\"CAC Act\") bodies in the general government sector. The Circular requires the ABC Board to report on compliance with the CAC Act 1997, CAC Orders 2008 and CAC Regulations 1997 and the Corporation's financial sustainability to the Minister of Finance and de regulation and the Minister responsible for the ABC by 15 October each year. To meet these requirements, the ABC established an internal compliance reporting framework. The Board signed and submitted the Compliance Report relating to the 2008-09 reporting period before the due date in October 2009.Freedom of Information The Freedom of Information Act 1982 (\"FOI Act\") gives the public the right to access documents held by the ABC. Part II of Schedule 2 of the FOI Act gives the ABC an exemption in relation to material that is program-related. du ring the past year, the ABC received 13 requests for access to documents under the FOI Act. Three requests were granted, four were granted in part and five were refused. One request was still being processed at the end of the financial year. Annual Report The ABC Annual Report 2008-09 received a gold award in the Australasian Reporting Awards for the quality of its content and presentation. This was the seventh successive ABC Annual Report to win gold. Internal Review Production Review In 2007, the ABC engaged the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) to review its television production activities and advise on the most efficient and effective production model and the appropriate balance between internal and external production. In March 2008, following detailed evaluation of BCG's recommendations, the Managing di rector announced that the ABC intended to implement a number of the recommended initiatives. In 2009-10, implementation work continued on a range of initiatives, including the nationwide replacement of ageing television news studio technology with a more efficient, automated studio system, and desktop editing of television news stories by journalists. The impact of these initiatives on program quality were tracked and analysed to allow improvements to be made to operational workflows. The review will continue into 2010-11 as part of the Corporation's ongoing evaluation of the efficiency of its television production model. The implementation of the Production Review program is overseen by a Steering Committee chaired by the Managing di rector and comprising representatives of relevant divisions. Work on the initiatives by divisional project teams is coordinated by the Corporate Strategy and Marketing di vision.Corporate governance4 CORPORATE PERFORMANCE 89Support Activities Review In October 2009, the ABC engaged BCG to review all ABC support activities. For the purpose of the review, a \"support activity\" was defined as an activity that is not directly related to content, distribution or transmission. The aim of the review was to identify inefficiencies in support functions with reference to best practice principles and with an emphasis on cost efficiency and effectiveness. The final report outlined a series of initiatives, some of which will be implemented over the next two years, following detailed planning and staff consultation. The implementation of the Support Activities Review program is overseen by a Steering Committee chaired by the Managing di rector and comprising representatives of relevant divisions. Work on the initiatives by divisional project teams is coordinated by a Project Management Office which reports to the di rector of Corporate Strategy and Marketing and the Chief Operating Officer. Election Coverage Review CommitteeWhen an election is called in any Australian jurisdiction, the ABC convenes an Election Coverage Review Committee to administer the free-time election broadcasts system under which the ABC broadcasts announcements by eligible political parties and to monitor coverage to ensure adherence to standards. The Election Coverage Review Committee is chaired by the di rector of Editorial Policies. The Committee monitors the amount of coverage across ABC platforms given to candidates and party officials (share-of-voice data). The data is used as a management tool to assist in ensuring that coverage meets requirements. Share-of-voice data is not, and is not intended to be, a definitive measure of impartiality. In 2009-10, elections were held in South Australia and Tasmania, both on 20 March 2010. Audience Contacts Another important avenue for assessing the ABC's performance with its core constituency is through audience feedback, including complaints. Complaints about issues such as factual inaccuracy, lack of balance, inappropriate content or bias are referred to the ABC's Audience and Consumer Affairs unit. Audience and Consumer Affairs is independent of ABC program areas and investigates all written complaints referring to possible breaches of the ABC's Editorial Policies, Code of Practice or Charter obligations. The unit also coordinates responses to a range of programming and policy enquiries. In 2009-10, the ABC logged 200 932 audience contacts\u2014a 2% increase on the previous year. This total included 55 929 letters and emails (a 0.4% decrease on the previous year) and 145 003 calls to switchboards in State and Territory capitals and to particular ABC programs and services (representing a 3% increase). 38 Key concerns reflected in the audience contacts this year included 1 556 written and phone complaints about Good Game . Of these, 1 536 were from viewers who were disappointed with a decision to remove Jeremy \"Junglist\" Ray as co-presenter of the program. Complainants felt that the change was unwarranted and many expressed dismay with the ABC's communication of the changes. Changes to scheduling of Time Team , which saw the program removed from air part-way through series 17, generated 405 complaints. The ABC removed the program from its schedule after the UK's Channel 4, which has the rights of first broadcast, rescheduled the series to later in the year. Of the 31 410 complaints received, 2 736 were claims of party political or other bias, 764 alleged lack of balance and 1 595 were claims of factual inaccuracy. These complaints related to a broad range of ABC programs and services. 38 C ombined audience contacts received by Audience and Consumer Affairs, News, switchboards and the Reception Advice Line (phone, letter and email).90 CORPORATE PERFORMANCETimeliness As outlined in the ABC Editorial Policies , the ABC endeavours to respond to complaints within 28 days. Between 1 July 2009 and 30 June 2010, ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs responded directly to 20 622 audience contacts. Of these, 14 156 (69%) received responses within 28 days. du ring 2009-10, 18 574 written complaints were finalised by Audience and Consumer Affairs. The unit provided a personal response to 11 177 of these complaints (comprising 11 621 issues), of which 7 824 (70%) received responses within 28 days. It referred 4 259 complaint contacts to other areas of the Corporation for direct response, while 46 complaint contacts were handled by the Complaints Review Executive and no substantive response was required for 3 092 complaint contacts. Complaint OutcomesAudience and Consumer Affairs plays two distinct roles in responding to audience complaints. Where a written complaint suggests that the ABC may have breached its Editorial Policies or Code of Practice , the unit investigates the complaint and determines whether ABC editorial standards have been maintained. In cases where this has not occurred, the complaint will be upheld (either fully or in part). At the same time, Audience and Consumer Affairs provides an audience liaison service for complaints about matters of personal taste and preference, such as scheduling matters or preferences for different presenters. While Audience and Consumer Affairs responds to these complaints, they are not capable of being upheld. The 11 177 responses to complaints sent by Audience and Consumer Affairs this year included both categories of complaint. du ring 2009-10, 5 208 complaint issues were investigated, of which 916 (18%) were upheld. This includes instances where large numbers of complaints about a single program were upheld. Over the 12 month period, 160 issues were upheld in relation to complaints about The Chaser's War On Everything 's \"Make a Realistic Wish Foundation\" sketch, 118 issues were upheld in relation to an inappropriate gesture made by an ABC News Breakfast presenter and 157 were issues upheld on grounds of inaccuracy and complaint handling in relation to a segment on Can We Help?

All upheld complaints are brought to the attention of the senior editorial staff responsible. In 2009-10, actions taken in response to upheld complaints included written apologies to complainants, on-air corrections and apologies, counselling or reprimanding of staff, removal of inappropriate content or correction of material on ABC Online and reviews of, and improvements, to procedures. Summaries of upheld complaints and reviews conducted by the Complaints Review Executive are published as individual complaints are finalised to provide members of the public with timely access to complaint decisions. The ABC also publishes a quarterly statistical overview of audience contacts on its website. Complaints Review ExecutiveThe Complaints Review Executive (CRE) provides an additional level of internal review for complainants who express dissatisfaction with Audience and Consumer Affairs' response to their complaint. The CRE is independent of both Audience and Consumer Affairs and all program units, has broad scope to review the content and the manner in which the complaint was originally handled and to determine whether the ABC acted appropriately and in accordance with the ABC Editorial Policies . This process does not preclude the complainant seeking external review via the Independent Complaints Review Panel or the Australian Communications and Media Authority. In the year ended 30 June 2010, the CRE reviewed 46 complaints, none of which was upheld. The CRE also adjudicated between ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs and ABC News on one matter. The CRE determined that the content had breached ABC editorial requirements. All CRE determinations are reported to the ABC Board and summaries of CRE reviews are published on the ABC's website.Independent Complaints Review Panel For persons not satisfied with the ABC's response to a written complaint, the ABC Board has established an Independent Complaints Review Panel (ICRP) to undertake independent review of complaints at no cost to the complainant. The ICRP can review complaints that raise allegations of serious cases of factual inaccuracy, bias, lack of balance or unfair treatment. Its members are external to the ABC. The Panel currently comprises the Convenor, The ho n Michael Foster QC, and Ms Susan Brooks. In the period 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010, the Panel received 17 requests to review complaints, of which ten were accepted for review. Seven requests not accepted for review either did not, in the Panel's judgement, allege a sufficiently serious case of factual inaccuracy, bias, lack of balance or unfair treatment to merit review, or involved matters outside of the ICRP's area of responsibility. Ten cases finalised by the Panel were published on the ABC's website during the reporting year, two of which were upheld (one in part) and eight of which were not upheld (see Appendix 17, page 193). At the end of the year, a further five reviews had been completed by the Panel but had not yet been published on the ABC's website, pending confirmation from the complainants that they had received the Panel's report. These matters will be detailed in next year's Annual Report. At the end of the reporting year, one review was in process. Australian Communications and Media AuthorityMembers of the public who complain to the ABC about matters covered by the ABC Code of Practice and who are dissatisfied with the ABC's response, or who do not receive a response within 60 days, may seek review from the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). du ring 2009-10, the ACMA advised the ABC that it had finalised investigations into 19 such matters (compared to 14 in 2008-09). In two cases, the ACMA found breaches of the ABC Code of Practice . The ACMA made no recommendations to the ABC. Commonwealth OmbudsmanThe Ombudsman finalised one investigation in relation to the ABC during the current reporting period. No adverse finding was made. n92 CORPORATE PERFORMANCEThE ABC I S R EQUIRE d by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 to prepare corporate plans which outline the overall strategies and policies that the Corporation will follow to achieve its objectives and fulfil its functions. This report documents the ABC's performance against the four strategic objectives in the ABC Corporate Plan 2007-10 . The ABC Corporate Plan 2007-10 includes three levels of performance measurement. The first level measures the effectiveness or outcome of ABC services in providing benefit to the Australian community. These measures and the ABC's performance against them in 2009-10 are set out on page 35. The second level measures how well the ABC performs in relation to four high-level objectives: G ood governance, O utput and audiences, V alue for money L earning and growth. These measures encompass 11 key result areas across the four dimensions of performance identified in the Plan. The third level of evaluation relates to the actions and performance targets set for each of 18 strategic priorities. 2009-10 was the third and final year of the ABC Corporate Plan 2007-10 . The following report concludes the reporting against that Plan. The ABC Strategic Plan 2010-13 will commence on 1 July 2010 (see page 87).Key Results Areas Measuring how well the ABC performs in relation to the four areas of performance\u2014good governance, output and audiences, value for money and learning and growth\u2014measured twice yearly. Objective One\u2014Ensure the ABC's independence, integrity and high standards. Efficiency of complaints management measured by performance against statutory and ABC-imposed timelines. du ring 2009-10, Audience and Consumer Affairs provided a personal response to 11 177 written complaints. Of these, 70% were responded to within the 28-day time period specified in the ABC Editorial Policies . Overall, 99% of written complaints were responded to within 60 days, which is the statutory period for response to complaints about ABC Code of Practice matters. du ring the same period, the ABC's Complaints Review Executive reviewed 46 complaints. Of these 91% were responded to within 28 days and 100% within 60 days. Results of Editorial Policy Assurance projects.One completed Quality Assurance (QA) project was published during the reporting period. The purpose of QA 7 Impartiality (TV News content) was to pilot a methodology designed to examine impartiality. The survey examined a sample of 30 items broadcast in the 7pm News bulletin during the review period which specifically mentioned the Federal Government's second stimulus package. The Project found that coverage of that issue during the review period met the test of impartiality that had been developed for the pilot. Fulfilment of statutory and regulatory obligations. The Corporation believes it has fulfilled all of its statutory and regulatory obligations during 2009-10, with the exception of responding to all written complaints within the 60-day statutory period. The ABC responded to 99% of written complaints within 60 days.Performance against the ABC Corporate Plan 2007-10CORPORATE PERFORMANCE 93 4Environmental impact assessment and evidence of response. The ABC is continuing with the review, assessment and implementation of green initiatives. The Corporation has set targets to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40% (to 60% of 1997 levels) by 2020 and by 60% (to 40% of 1997 levels) by 2050. In 2009-10, the overall energy intensity of all ABC Australian buildings remained at 858 megajoules per square metre per annum. 39 The total waste generated at ABC capital city sites was 920 tonnes, a 25% decrease from 2008-09 levels. 40 The ABC's direct Greenhouse gas emissions for 2009-10 are estimated at 47 560 tonnes, 41 a gross increase of 0.2% from 2008-09 emission levels.42 Information about the ABC's environmental impact is reported at page 113. Objective Two\u2014To be recognised as the leading Australian public media space where people engage with issues and ideas.

Significant efficiencies and operational benefits are being delivered by Media hu b, a fully-automated and centralised television presentation facility. Efficiencies continue to be gained from the ongoing implementation of new technologies, such as desk-top editing and studio automation. du ring the year, the ABC upgraded the complex hu man Resources, Payroll and Rostering systems from SAP version 4.6C to SAP ERP 6.0 ( hC M). A new portal, myWorkSpace , was implemented for Employee Self Service (ESS) and Manager Self Service (MSS) functions such as viewing payslips, viewing and changing personal information, online electronic leave processing and management reporting. The upgrade of the systems and implementation of the new portal provide the latest SAP software functionality, as well as a base for replacing existing paper-based systems and fragmented administrative processes with online electronic business processing. Levels of new business activities. The following provides a cross-section of activity during 2009-10. ABC Radio secured radio rights for the coverage of a number of significant sporting events, entering agreements with the Australian Football League (for the 2010 and 2011 seasons), Cricket Australia (for radio and streaming rights to the end of the 2012-13 season and with the National Rugby League (for radio and streaming rights to the end of the 2012 season). On 8 July 2009, a new dedicated digital radio sport channel, ABC Grandstand, was launched with uninterrupted ball-by-ball coverage of the Ashes cricket series live from the United Kingdom. In June 2010, ABC Innovation launched an application specifically for the iPad. In October 2009, ABC International launched a new Burmese language service on Radio Australia. The ABC partnered with Education Services Australia on a pilot project to digitise and publish two collections of ABC archival video clips, mapped directly to specific national curriculum subjects.Value of non-Appropriation revenue as a percentage of total costs. 4.5% (6.0% in 2008-09). Qualitative evidence of engagement with external stakeholders. The following is a cross section of activity during 2009-10: A BC Rural contributed to community education and awareness around a range of critical issues, such as locust plagues and drought support. T he ABC maintains relationships with international broadcasting associations, including the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU), the Asia-Pacific Institute for Broadcasting de velopment (AIB d) , Pacific Islands News Association (PINA), the Commonwealth Broadcasting Association (CBA) and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). I n March 2010, the ABC held its annual Showcase at Parliament ho use, inviting all Members of Parliament and Senators. M embers of the public are invited to visit the ABC, with guided tours being conducted at many sites. Tours of the ABC Ultimo Centre in Sydney attracted over 7 000 visitors in 2009-10. Objective Four\u2014Sustain and grow the ABC through high-quality leadership and an environment of responsibility and opportunity. Employee survey results. Following the launch of ABC Values in March 2009, the ABC has focused on creating a work environment which encourages employees to embrace and demonstrate those values. In that context, an employee survey is not considered beneficial, and accordingly it no longer forms an integral part of the People and Learning di vision's current plans. Measurement of employee engagement may be undertaken, once further steps have been taken to build a values-based culture. Turnover and absenteeism benchmarked externally. The ABC tracks employee-initiated separation and unscheduled leave. In the past, the Corporation has used free benchmarking services (updated annually) 96 CORPORATE PERFORMANCEthrough the Australian hu man Resource Institute and Info hR M Consulting. Those resources are no longer available. ho wever, the ABC continues to report internal turnover and absenteeism results. Employee-initiated separation (turnover) measures the proportion of the workforce that initiated its own separation from the ABC and indicates unplanned skill loss to the ABC. In 2009-10, the rate of turnover was 6.4% (compared to 7.0% in 2008-09). Unscheduled leave measures the percentage of available workdays employees are absent on personal leave for unscheduled reasons. This can be an indicator of employee morale and a predictor of future turnover. In 2009-10, the absence rate was 7.53 days per full-time equivalent employee (compared to 6.87 days in 2008-09). This indicates that each employee, on average, is absent from work (for instance due to illness) for about eight days each year.

In 2009, the ABC expanded the scope of data it collects in relation to water consumption and waste management, and data was collected from more sites than previous years. The expansion in the scope and number of data collection sites was reflected in an improvement to the ABC's scores in the areas of climate change and waste and resource management.

Replacement of the glass used to partition offices and cubicles to comply with current building and safety standards at Ultimo resulted in 5 632 kg of glass being recycled. Carpet that has a backing made from recycled PET bottles was installed during refurbishment of areas within buildings at Southbank (Victoria) and Ultimo and Orange (New South Wales). The Corporation entered into a new waste management contract at Collinswood that resulted in 95% of waste generated at that site being recycled. In 2009-10, total paper consumption decreased by 6%, much of which is due to the increase in electronic processes. Over 4 000 staff have made the switch from paper payslips to email payslips. Paper payslips will be phased out in 2011 and a move to paperless forms for employment-related activities should also be completed in 2011.

The ABC's retail and publishing activities extend the life of ABC on-air content. By shopping in store or online, audiences can enjoy their favourite programs whenever they like.120 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEON 30 J U LY 2010, the Audit and Risk Committee endorsed the signing of the 2009-10 Financial Statements and the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) issued an unqualified audit opinion. Financial Outcome 2009-10 As in previous years, the ABC operated within its total sources of funds and revenue from Government for the 2009-10 financial year. Sources of Funds 2009-10 The ABC was allocated $929.9 million in the May 2009 Federal Budget. In the Commonwealth Budget Additional Estimates process, the ABC was allocated additional funding for Outcome 2, analog transmission, and Outcome 3, digital transmission, bringing the total appropriation received in 2009-10 to $932.1 million. The ABC also received $185.4 million from other sources, including ABC Commercial. The chart \"ABC Source of Funds 2009-10\" depicts the ABC's budgeted funds for the various categories against actual sources for 2009-10 and its budgeted sources for 2010-11. Application of Funds The chart \"Split Actual Expenditure 2009-10\" broadly represents the ABC's application of funds by function for the 2009-10 financial year. The Year Ahead Revenue from Government The May 2009 Federal Budget maintained the ABC's funding base and provided additional funding for a dedicated digital children's television channel, more Australian television drama, establishment of regional broadband hubs throughout Australia, and funding for 2009-10 only to assist in the maintenance of the ABC's asset base. The ABC's funding for the 2010-11 financial year is: $ m Total revenue from Government per Outcomes 1, 2, 3 and 4, including equity injection 9 72.6 Less Analog Transmission funds - 95.9 Less di gital Transmission funds - 94.2 Less di gital Radio Transmission funds - 3.5 Total Revenue from Government 7 79.0The chart \"ABC Revenue from Govermnent by Outcomes and Programs 2009-10\" broadly represents the ABC's budgeted appropriation of funds by output for the 2010-11 financial year. Budget StrategyAlthough additional funding was announced in the Federal Budget, this funding is tied to specific initiatives and is not available to address the continual cost pressure arising from the ABC's existing cost base. The difficult retail environment and its impact on ABC Commercial also placed additional pressure on tight financial conditions within the Corporation. The 2010-11 Budget Strategy seeks to address these pressures and maintain ABC output activities and levels, to ensure ABC recurrent activities remain funded from recurrent sources. It also seeks to ensure resource allocations are consistent with the ABC's strategic objectives and that a careful balance remains between ensuring existing content, facilities and operations are maintained at sustainable levels, and funding vital future projects for the ABC, for example, ABC News 24, a new dedicated 24-hour news service to be launched in early 2010-11. The Corporation is in the process of implementing recommendations of a review of its television production activities. This process has already delivered operational savings, and is expected to deliver further operational efficiencies over the next few years. Savings to date have been applied to sustainability, as well as new strategic initiatives, including the new ABC News 24 digital channel. Funding to assist with the maintenance of the ABC's asset base announced in the May 2010 Federal Budget is for 2010-11 only. The Corporation will continue to liaise with Government in relation to its funding requirements for asset replacement, in the context of the findings of the second stage of the ABC's Integrated Capital Strategy. Comparative Revenue from GovernmentThe 2010-11 operational revenue from Government of $779 million represents a decrease in real funding of $251 million or 24.4% since 1985-86 as depicted in the chart \"ABC Operational Revenue from Government\". Financial summaryFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 1215The ABC receives funding from different sources, the majority coming from the Federal Government. Split of actual expenditure broadly represents how the ABC allocates its funds by function.This graph shows how funding is allocated to six specified Programs which relate to four Outcomes. Performance against these Outcomes is reported at page 103.The ABC was allocated $932.1 million in the 2009 Federal Budget. Over 70% of the ABC's expenditure is on making and distributing content.79% of Government funding was allocated to content-related activities.122 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEFive-year Analysis 2 010 2 009 2 008 2 007 2 006 ABC Operating $ '000 $ '000 $ '000 $ '000 $ '000 C ost of Services 1 101 074 1 078 755 1 041 391 9 76 459 929 236 Operating Revenue 1 84 260 2 34 222 2 19 641 1 85 206 187 015 Net Cost of Services (a) 9 16 814 8 44 533 8 21 750 7 91 253 742 221 Revenue from Government 9 15 058 8 58 411 8 33 963 8 09 532 774 254 2 010 2 009 2 008 2 007 2 006 Financial Position $ '000 $ '000 $ '000 $ '000 $ '000 Current Assets 2 37 927 2 75 761 2 76 332 2 44 513 248 309 Non-Current Assets 1 004 396 9 48 920 9 78 828 8 01 727 795 930 Total Assets 1 242 343 1 224 681 1 255 160 1 046 240 1 044 239 Current Liabilities 2 41 388 2 30 403 1 74 080 1 50 428 147 567 Non-Current Liabilities 2 4 161 4 8 187 1 14 002 1 36 059 154 518 Total Liabilities 2 65 549 2 78 590 2 88 082 2 86 487 302 085 Total Equity 9 76 774 9 46 091 9 67 078 7 59 753 742 154 R atios C urrent Ratio (b) 0 .99 1 .20 1 .59 1 .63 1.68 Equity (c) 7 9% 7 7% 7 7% 7 3% 7 1% (a) Net cost of services is cost of services less operating revenue.

The Directors' Responsibility for the Financial StatementsThe directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the Finance Minister's Orders made under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 , including the Australian Accounting Standards (which include the Australian Accounting Interpretations). This responsibility includes establishing and maintaining internal controls relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances. Auditor's ResponsibilityMy responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on my audit. I have conducted my audit in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards, which incorporate the Australian Auditing Standards. These auditing standards require that I comply with relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Corporation's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.Auditor-General for Australia124 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEIndependence In conducting the audit, I have followed the independence requirements of the Australian National Audit Office, which incorporate the requirements of the Australian accounting profession.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The principal accounting policies adopted in preparing the financial statements of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (the \"Corporation\" or \"ABC\") are stated to assist in a general understanding of these financial statements. The financial report of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation for the year ended 30 June 2010 was authorised for issue by the Directors on 30 July 2010. 1.1 Objectives of the Corporation The Corporation is an Australian Government controlled entity. The objectives of the Corporation are derived explicitly from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 and are: Objective 1\u2014Ensure the Corporation's independence, integrity and high standards; Objective 2\u2014To be recognised as the leading Australian public media space where people engage with issues and ideas; Objective 3\u2014Deliver maximum benefit to the people of Australia through the effective and efficient delivery of the Corporations' services; and Objective 4\u2014Sustain and grow the Corporation through high quality leadership and an environment of responsibility and opportunity. The Corporation is structured to meet four outcomes: Outcome 1\u2014Audiences throughout Australia\u2014and overseas\u2014are informed, educated and entertained. Outcome 2\u2014Australian and international communities have access to at least the scale and quality of satellite and analog terrestrial radio and television transmission services that existed at 30 June 2003. Outcome 3\u2014The Australian community has access to ABC digital television services in accordance with approved digital implementation plans. Outcome 4\u2014The Australian community has access to ABC digital radio services in accordance with approved digital implementation plans. The continued existence of the Corporation in its present form and with its present programs is dependent on Government policy and on continuing funding by Parliament for the Corporation's administration and programs. 1.2 Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements The financial statements and notes are required by clause 1(b) of Schedule 1 to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 , as amended and are a General Purpose Financial Report. The financial statements and notes have been prepared in accordance with: Finance Minister's Orders (FMO) for reporting periods ending on or after 1 July 2009; and Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) that apply for the year ended 30 June 2010. The Corporation's financial statements have been prepared on an accruals basis and are in accordance with the historical cost convention, except for certain assets and liabilities, which are at fair value. Except where stated, no allowance is made for the effect of changing prices on the results or the financial position. The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars and values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars unless disclosure of the full amount is specifically required. Unless alternative treatment is specifically required by an accounting standard or the FMO, assets and liabilities are recognised in the Corporation's Balance Sheet when and only when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Corporation and the amounts of the assets or liabilities can be reliably measured. However, assets and liabilities arising under agreements equally proportionately unperformed are not recognised unless required by an accounting standard. Liabilities and assets that are unrecognised are reported in the Schedule of Commitments and the Schedule of Contingencies (other than unquantifiable or remote contingencies, which are reported at Note 14: Contingent Assets and Liabilities).Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2010Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2010 5 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 1351. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.2 Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements continued Unless alternative treatment is specifically required by an accounting standard, revenues, gains and expenses are recognised in the Corporation's Statement of Comprehensive Income when and only when the flow or consumption or loss of economic benefits has occurred and can be reliably measured. 1.3 Significant Accounting Judgements, Estimates and Assumptions Significant Accounting Judgements In the process of applying the accounting policies, the Corporation has taken the fair value of freehold land to be the market value of similar locations and the fair value of freehold buildings to be the depreciated replacement cost, as determined by an independent valuer. Significant Accounting Estimates and Assumptions The Corporation has applied the following estimates and assumptions: Long service leave, as detailed in Note 1.12: Employee Benefits; Provision for make good, as detailed in Note 1.13: Leases; Valuation of properties, plant and equipment, as detailed in Note 1.22: Property (Land and Buildings), Infrastructure, Plant and Equipment; Depreciation, as detailed in Note 1.22: Property (Land and Buildings), Infrastructure, Plant and Equipment; Impairment of non-financial assets, as detailed in Note 1.23: Impairment of Non-Current Assets; and Program amortisation, as detailed in Note 1.25: Inventories. No other accounting assumptions or estimates have been identified that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next year. 1.4 Statement of Compliance Adoption of new Australian Accounting Standard requirements No accounting standard has been adopted earlier than the application date stated in the standard. The following adopted requirements have affected the amounts reported in the current or prior periods or are estimated to have a financial effect in future reporting periods. AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements and AASB 1049 Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial Reporting. This standard introduces the notion of a \"complete set of financial statements\", which alters the structure of the financial statements and replaces the balance sheet with a statement of financial position and replaces the income statement with a statement of comprehensive income. The statement of comprehensive income includes all income and expense items, including those previously recognised in equity, such as asset revaluation increments. The Corporation has elected to retain the \"balance sheet\" consistent with the requirements of the FMO. As a result of this standard, AASB 2007-8 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from AASB 101 and AASB 2008-9 Amendments to AASB 1049 for Consistency with AASB 101 were also issued and apply to reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 and have been adopted, as appropriate. AASB 2007-6 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from AASB 123 and AASB 2009-1 Amendments to Accounting for Borrowing Costs of Not-for-Profit Public Sector EntitiesAASB 2007-6 removed the option of expensing borrowing costs related to the qualifying assets of for profit entities. Not-for-profit public sector entities may elect to recognise borrowing costs as expenses in the period in which they are incurred regardless of how the borrowings are applied. AASB 2009-1 includes the option for not-for profit public sector entities to expense borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset. The Corporation has continued to expense borrowing costs in accordance with the standard and the requirements of the FMO.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2010 136 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.4 Statement of Compliance continued Adoption of new Australian Accounting Standard requirements continued AASB 2008-5 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from the Annual Improvements Project [AASB 5, 7, 101, 102, 107, 108, 110, 116, 118, 119, 120, 123, 127, 128, 129, 131, 132, 134, 136, 138, 139, 140, 141, 1023 and 1038]. These amendments are mandatory for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. There are many changes that affect a number of standards. The changes applicable to the Corporation include amending the classification requirements of current assets and current liabilities to be when assets are expected to be realised within 12 months and liabilities expected to be settled within 12 months and have been incorporated in the financial statements, as appropriate. AASB 2009-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards\u2014Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments arising from AASB 7 . The amendment to the standard requires additional disclosure on the fair value measurement of financial instruments, including disclosure within a three-level hierarchy including quoted prices in active markets, valuation methodology using inputs observable in active markets and valuation methodology using unobservable inputs (specific additional disclosure is also required for this level). Enhanced disclosure on liquidity risk is required, primarily a separate liquidity risk analysis for derivative and non-derivative financial liabilities. It applies to reporting periods starting on or after 1 January 2009 and has been incorporated in the financial statements, as appropriate. Future Australian Accounting Standard requirements The following new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations have been issued by the AASB but are effective for future reporting periods. It is estimated that the impact of adopting these pronouncements, when effective, will not have a material financial impact on the Corporation's financial statements. AASB 9 Financial Instruments is the first part of Phase 1 of the International Accounting Standards Board's project to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement) . This standard will apply to reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. The standard will include changes to classification and measurement, impairment methodology and hedge accounting measures including reducing the categories of financial assets to two: amortised cost and fair value. The Corporation will be required to classify its held to maturity investments and loans and receivables at \"amortised cost\". The Corporation has elected not to early adopt this Standard to be consistent with the current FMO. AASB 2009-11 Amendments to the Australian Accounting Standards arising from AASB 9 [AASB 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 101, 102, 108, 112, 118, 121, 127, 128, 131, 132, 136, 139, 1023, 1038 and Interpretations 10 and 12] . The amendments to these standards arise from the issue of AASB 9 Financial Instruments as discussed above that sets out requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets. This Standard applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. As the Corporation has chosen not to early adopt AASB 9 the amendments to these standards will also not be early adopted. AASB 124 Related Party Disclosures. This standard will apply to reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011. The standard has been modified to simplify and clarify the definition of a related party and partial exemptions have been included for government-related entities. The Corporation has chosen not to early adopt this standard to remain consistent with the current FMO. AASB 2009-5 Further Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from the Annual Improvements Process. This amendment provides for changes to presentation, disclosure, recognition and measurement to a number of standards. The main changes affecting the Corporation include changes to AASB 117 Leases which requires leases that include both land and buildings elements to be assessed separately for classification of each element as a finance lease or an operating lease while changes to AASB 107 Statement of Cash Flows requires only expenditures that result in a recognised asset in the Balance Sheet to be classified as investing activities. This standard is applicable to reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011. The Corporation has chosen not to early adopt this standard to remain consistent with the current FMO.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2010 5 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 1371. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.4 Statement of Compliance continued Future Australian Accounting Standard requirements continued AASB 2010-4 Further Amendments to the Australian Accounting Standards arising from the Annual Improvements Project [AASB 1, 7, 101, 134 and Interpretation 13] . The main amendments that affect the Corporation include removing the requirement to disclose each item of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity and to disclose only other comprehensive income and changes to the fair value measurement of award credits under customer loyalty programmes. The amendments are applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011. The Corporation has elected not to early adopt this standard to remain consistent with the current FMO. There are other changes proposed to the Australian Accounting Standards but these are not expected to have a material impact on the Corporation's reporting in future periods. 1.5 Taxation The Corporation is not subject to income tax pursuant to Section 71 of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 . The Corporation's controlled entities, Music Choice Australia Pty Ltd and The News Channel Pty Limited, while subject to income tax, have been inactive since the year ended 30 June 2000 up to and including 30 June 2010. The Corporation's equity interests in MediaHub Australia Pty Limited, Freeview Australia Pty Limited and National DAB Licence Company Limited are subject to income tax. Goods and Services Tax Revenues, gains, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST except where the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). In these circumstances, the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the revenue or expense. Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included.The net amount of GST receivable from the ATO is included as a financial asset in the Balance Sheet while any net amount of GST payable to the ATO is included as a liability in the Balance Sheet. Cash flows are included in the Cash Flow Statement on a net basis. The GST components arising from investing and financing activities which are recoverable from or payable to the ATO are classified as operating cash flows. Commitments and contingencies are disclosed on a net basis. Net GST commitments recoverable from, or payable to, the ATO are disclosed. 1.6 Foreign Currency Transactions The Corporation enters into foreign currency hedging arrangements to protect its purchasing power in relation to foreign currency exposures. Revenues and expenditures denominated in foreign currencies are converted to Australian dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction, or at the hedged rate. All gains and losses are taken to profit or loss with the exception of forward exchange contracts that are classified as cash flow hedges used to hedge highly probable transactions. Gains and losses on cash flow hedges held at balance date are taken to equity. All monetary foreign currency balances are converted to Australian dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at balance date. Monetary assets and liabilities of overseas branches and amounts payable to or by the Corporation in foreign currencies are translated into Australian dollars at the applicable exchange rate at balance date. Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2010 138 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.7 Reporting by Outcomes and Segments A comparison by outcomes relevant to the Corporation is presented in Note 21: Reporting by Outcomes. Any intra-government costs are eliminated in calculating the actual budget outcome for the Government overall. The Corporation principally provides a national television and radio service within the broadcasting industry. It is therefore considered for segmental reporting to operate predominantly in one industry and in one geographical area, Australia. 1.8 Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when: the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer; the seller retains no managerial involvement nor effective control over the goods; the revenue and transaction costs incurred can be reliably measured; and it is probable that the economic benefit associated with the transaction will flow to the Corporation. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised at fair value of the consideration received net of the amount of GST upon delivery of the goods to customers. Revenue from rendering of services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of contracts at the reporting date. Revenue is recognised when: the amount of revenue, stage of completion and transaction costs incurred can be reliably measured; and the probable economic benefits with the transaction will flow to the Corporation. The stage of completion of contracts at the reporting date is determined by reference to the proportion that costs incurred to date bear to the estimated total costs of the transaction. Credit sales are on normal commercial terms.Receivables for goods and sales, which have 30 day terms, are recognised at the nominal amounts due less any provision for bad and doubtful debts. The ability to collect debt is reviewed at the balance date. Provisions are made when the recovery of debt is no longer probable. Interest revenue is recognised using the effective interest method as set out in AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement . Revenues from Government receivable are recognised at their nominal amounts. Subsidies, grants, sponsorships and donations are recognised on receipt unless paid to the Corporation for a specific purpose where recognition of revenue will be recognised in accordance with the agreement. 1.9 Gains and losses Sale of Assets Gains or losses from disposal of non-current assets are recognised when control of the asset has passed to the buyer. 1.10 Grants The Corporation receives grant monies from time to time. Most grant agreements require the Corporation to perform services or provide facilities, or to meet eligibility criteria. A liability in respect of unearned revenues is recognised to the extent the services or facilities have not been provided or eligibility criteria have not been met.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2010 5 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 1391. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.11 Transactions by the Government as Owner Revenue from Government Parliament appropriates monies to the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (DBCDE), which is then distributed to the Corporation and recognised as revenue from Government. The full amount received in respect of departmental outputs for the year is disclosed in Note 5: Revenue from Government. Equity Injections Amounts appropriated by the Parliament as equity injections are recognised as \"contributed equity\" in accordance with the FMO. Other Distributions to Owners The FMO require that distributions to owners be debited to contributed equity unless in the nature of a dividend. The Corporation also received monies from the Government by way of loans as detailed in Note 10: Interest Bearing Liabilities. Contributions Income is measured at the fair value of the contributions received or receivable. Income arising from the contribution of an asset to the Corporation is recognised when the entity obtains control of the contribution or the right to receive the contribution, it is probable that the economic benefits comprising the contribution will flow to the Corporation and the amount of the contribution can be measured reliably. 1.12 Employee Benefits Liabilities for services rendered by employees are recognised at the reporting date to the extent that they have not been settled. Liabilities for short-term employee benefits (as defined in AASB 119 Employee Benefits ) and termination benefits expected to be settled within twelve months are measured at their nominal amounts.The nominal amount is calculated with regard to the rates expected to be paid on settlement of the liability. All other employee benefit liabilities are measured as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. Leave The liability for employee benefits includes provision for annual leave and long service leave. No provision has been made for sick leave as all sick leave is non-vesting and the average sick leave taken in future years by employees is estimated to be less than the annual entitlement for sick leave. The leave liabilities are calculated on the basis of employees' remuneration at the estimated salary rates that will apply at the time the leave is taken, including the employer superannuation contribution rates to the extent that the leave is likely to be taken during service rather than paid out on termination. The liability for long service leave for the Corporation has been determined by reference to the work of an actuary, Professional Financial Consulting Pty Ltd, as at 30 June 2010. The liability for long service leave represents the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made by the Corporation resulting from employees' services provided up to the balance date. The estimate of the present value of the liability takes into account attrition rates and pay increases through promotion and inflation. Superannuation Employees are members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS), Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS), the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan Scheme (PSSap) or another non-Commonwealth Superannuation (ARIA) fund. The CSS and PSS are defined benefit schemes for the Australian Government. The PSSap and ARIA are defined contribution schemes.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2010 140 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.12 Employee Benefits continued Superannuation continued The liability for defined benefits is recognised in the financial statements of the Australian Government and is settled by the Australian Government in due course. This liability is reported by the Department of Finance and Deregulation as an administered item. The Corporation makes employer contributions to the employee superannuation schemes at rates determined by an actuary to be sufficient to meet the current cost to the Government of the superannuation entitlements of the Corporations' employees. The Corporation accounts for the contributions as if they were contributions to defined contribution plans. The liability for superannuation recognised as at 30 June represents outstanding contributions for the last 8 days of the period. 1.13 Leases A distinction is made between finance leases and operating leases. Finance leases effectively transfer from the lessor to the lessee substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of leased non-current assets. An operating lease is a lease that is not a finance lease. In operating leases, the lessor effectively retains substantially all such risks and benefits. Operating lease payments are expensed on a straight-line basis which is representative of the pattern of benefits derived from the leased assets. Operating lease rentals are not segregated between minimum lease payments, contingent rents and sublease payments, as required by AASB 117 Leases , as these components are not individually material. Lease incentives taking the form of \"free\" leasehold improvements and rent holidays are recognised as liabilities. These liabilities are reduced by allocating lease payments between rental expense and reduction of the liability. Provision for Make Good A provision for make good exists when the Corporation has an obligation to \"make good\" leased properties at the end of the lease term. As many of the leases are negotiable, the Corporation has determined the provision as set out below. Retail leased premises A provision has been recognised for retail leases where the Corporation is obligated per the lease agreement to make good the site or where the Corporation believes there is some probability that it will incur costs to make good the site. The provision is calculated based on the estimated average cost to make good each site, plus an allowance for inflation and then multiplied by a factor representing the probability that make good costs will be incurred at some point in the next five years. Other leased premises A provision has been recognised for non-retail leased premises on the following basis: Leases expiring in: Method Less than 6 months 100% of estimated costs Greater than 6 months, but less than 1 year 75% of estimated costs Greater than 1 year, but less than 2 years 50% of estimated costs Greater than 2 years Nil A provision for those leases expiring later than two years has not been adopted as it is not possible to determine the probability of vacating the premises. 1.14 Borrowing Costs All borrowing costs are expensed as incurred.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2010 5 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 1411. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.15 Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet comprise cash at bank and on hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and cash equivalents are recognised at their nominal amounts. 1.16 Financial Assets The Corporation classifies its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; held-to-maturity investments; and loans and receivables. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Financial assets are recognised and derecognised upon trade date. Effective Interest Method The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period. Income is recognised on an effective interest rate basis except for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Fair Value Through Profit or Loss Financial assets are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss where the financial assets: have been acquired principally for the purpose of being sold in the near future; are a part of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that the Corporation manages together and has a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or are derivatives that are not designated and effective as a hedging instrument. Assets in this category are classified as current assets. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest earned on the financial asset. The Corporation's financial assets in this category are forward exchange contracts which are derivative financial instruments. Gains and losses on these items are recognised through profit or loss except if they are classified as a cash flow hedge where they are recognised in the hedging reserve within equity. Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the contract is entered into and are subsequently revalued to reflect changes in fair value. Forward exchange contracts are carried as assets when their net fair value is positive and as liabilities when their net fair value is negative. For the purpose of hedge accounting, the Corporation's hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable either to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset, liability or to a highly probable forecast transaction. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Corporation formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Corporation wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Corporation will assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value or cash flow attributable to the hedged risk. Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2010 142 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.16 Financial Assets continued Fair Value Through Profit or Loss continued Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow hedge is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts taken to equity are transferred to profit or loss when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when hedged income or expenses are recognised or when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. When the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain until the forecast transaction occurs. If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to profit or loss. Held-to-Maturity Investments Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity dates that the Corporation has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity investments in accordance with AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement . Held-to-maturity investments are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method less impairment, with revenue recognised on an effective yield basis. Surplus cash has been invested into short term investments with maturities at acquisition date of greater than three months. These investments are included as \"other receivables\". Loans and Receivables Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables in accordance with AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement . They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less impairment. Interest is recognised by applying the effective interest rate. Trade debtors are normally settled within 30 days unless otherwise agreed and are carried at amounts due, less an allowance for doubtful debt. Impairment of Financial Assets Financial assets are assessed for impairment at each balance date. Financial assets held at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred for loans and receivables or held to maturity investments held at amortised cost, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. The carrying amount is reduced by way of an allowance account. The loss is taken to profit or loss. Held to maturity investments Investments held to maturity by the Corporation have maturities less than 12 months and Standard & Poors credit ratings of A- or better and are deemed not to be impaired. Bad and doubtful debts The Corporation makes a specific provision for debts considered doubtful by conducting a detailed review of material debtors, making an assessment of the likelihood of recovery of those debts and taking into account past bad debts experience. Bad debts are written off when identified.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2010 5 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 1431. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.17 Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as \"other financial liabilities\" in accordance with AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement . Other Financial Liabilities Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. The fair value of loans from Government is deemed to be the initial principal amount. The Corporation does not have any commercial bank loans. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period. Loans are classified as current liabilities unless the Corporation has the unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. Supplier and other payables are recognised at amortised cost. Liabilities are recognised to the extent that the goods or services have been received (and irrespective of having been invoiced). Standard ABC settlement terms are 30 days commercial. 1.18 Repairs and Maintenance Maintenance, repair expenses and minor renewals which do not constitute an upgrade or enhancement of equipment are expensed as incurred. 1.19 Joint Ventures Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method in accordance with AASB 131 Interests in Joint Ventures and the FMO. Further details relating to joint ventures, to which the Corporation is a party to, are provided in Note 7: Investments Accounted for Using the Equity Method. 1.20 Contingent Assets and Contingent Liabilities Contingent assets and contingent liabilities are not recognised in the Balance Sheet but are disclosed in the relevant schedule and Note 14: Contingent Assets and Liabilities. They may arise from uncertainty as to the existence of an asset or liability, or represent an asset or liability in respect of which the amount cannot be reliably measured. Contingent assets are disclosed when settlement is probable but not virtually certain and contingent liabilities are disclosed when settlement is greater than remote. 1.21 Acquisition of Assets Assets are recorded at cost at the time of acquisition except as stated below. The cost of acquisition includes the fair value of assets transferred in exchange and liabilities undertaken. Assets acquired at no cost, or for nominal consideration, are initially recognised as assets at their fair value at the date of acquisition. 1.22 Property (Land and Buildings), Infrastructure, Plant and Equipment Asset Recognition Threshold Purchases of property, infrastructure, plant and equipment are recognised initially at cost in the Balance Sheet. Purchases costing less than $2 000 are expensed in the year of acquisition except where they form part of a project or group of similar items, which are significant in total. Basis of Revaluation Land, buildings, infrastructure, plant and equipment are carried at fair value. Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2010 144 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.22 Property (Land and Buildings), Infrastructure, Plant and Equipment continued Basis of Revaluation continued Fair values for each class of asset are determined as shown below. Asset Class Fair Value Measured at Freehold Land Market Value Freehold Buildings Depreciated replacement cost Leasehold Land Depreciated replacement cost Leasehold Buildings Depreciated replacement cost Leasehold Improvements Depreciated replacement cost Infrastructure, plant and equipment Depreciated replacement cost Following initial recognition at cost, property, infrastructure, plant and equipment are carried at fair value less subsequent accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Valuations are conducted with sufficient frequency to ensure that the carrying amounts of assets do not materially vary, with the assets' fair values as at the reporting date. The regularity of independent valuations depends upon the volatility of movements in market values for the relevant assets. Revaluation adjustments are made on a class basis. Any revaluation increment is credited to equity under the heading of revaluation reserve except to the extent that it reverses a previous revaluation decrement of the same asset class that was previously recognised through profit or loss. Revaluation decrements for a class of assets are recognised directly through profit or loss except to the extent that they reverse a previous revaluation increment for that class. Any accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the asset restated to the revalued amount. Depreciation Depreciable property, infrastructure, plant and equipment assets are written-off to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method of depreciation. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the improvements or the unexpired period of the lease. Depreciation rates (useful lives) and methods are reviewed at each reporting date and necessary adjustments are recognised in the current, or current and future reporting periods, as appropriate. Depreciation rates applying to each class of depreciable asset are initially based on the following useful lives: 2010 2009 Buildings on freehold land 50 years 50 years Leasehold buildings Life of Lease Life of Lease Leasehold improvements 5 to 99 years 5 to 99 years Infrastructure, plant and equipment 3 to 15 years 3 to 15 years The aggregate amount of depreciation and amortisation allocated for each class of asset during the reporting period is disclosed in Note 3C: Depreciation and amortisation. Assets Held for Sale Assets held for sale are stated in the Balance Sheet at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses are recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of assets classified as held for sale to their fair value less costs to sell. Any gains for subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell for assets classified as held for sale are recognised only to the extent that they are not in excess of the cumulative impairment losses that have been recognised in accordance with AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations or previously in accordance with AASB 1 36 Impairment of Assets .Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2010 5 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 1451. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.22 Property (Land and Buildings), Infrastructure, Plant and Equipment continued Assets Held for Sale continued If any assets classified as held for sale, no longer meet the criteria under AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations , the Corporation will cease to classify the asset as held for sale. Non-current assets that cease to be classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of: a. the carrying amount before the asset was classified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation, amortisation or revaluations that would have been recognised had the asset not been classified as held for sale; and b. the recoverable amount at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell. Any adjustment to the carrying amount of non-current assets that cease to be classified as held for sale is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the assets no longer meet the criteria as held for sale. 1.23 Impairment of Non-Current Assets All non-current assets except: inventories; assets arising from employee benefits; financial assets that are within the scope of AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement ; and non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale in accordance with AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations ; are subject to an assessment as to indicators of impairment under AASB 136 Impairment of Assets . At the reporting date, the Corporation has assessed whether there are any indications that assets may be impaired. Where indications of impairment exist, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated and an impairment adjustment made if the asset's recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount. Recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. Where the future economic benefit of an asset is not primarily dependent on the asset's ability to generate future cash flows, and the asset would be replaced if the Corporation were deprived of the asset, its value in use is taken to be its depreciated replacement cost. 1.24 Intangible Assets The Corporation's intangibles comprise software for internal use, broadcast licences and spectrum provided by the Australian Government. Software is initially recognised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over anticipated useful lives between 3-6 years (2009 3-6 years). These assets are assessed for indications of impairment. The carrying amounts of impaired assets are written down to the higher of their net market selling price or depreciated replacement cost. The Corporation's right to use broadcast licences and spectrum are held at their fair value. 1.25 Inventories Inventories held for resale are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Inventories not held for resale are valued at the lower of cost, adjusted for any loss in service potential, based on the existence of a current replacement cost that is lower than the original acquisition cost or other subsequent carrying amount. Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2010 146 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.25 Inventories continued Produced Programs Television programs are produced for domestic transmission and include direct salaries and expenses and production overheads allocated on a usage basis to the program. Production overheads not allocated to programs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. External contributions received in respect of co-production of television programs are offset against production costs which are recorded as Inventories in the Balance Sheet. The cost of produced television program inventory is amortised as follows: News, Current Affairs and Live Programs\u2014100% on first screening; Factual and Entertainment programs based on current topics\u2014100% on first screening; Childrens, Education and Movies\u2014straight-line over three years from completion of production; All other programs not covered above\u201490% first screening and 10% second screening or in third year; and Programs not shown within three years of completion or purchase to be amortised 100% in year three. Previously, programs commissioned specifically for ABC2 were amortised equally over three years. From 1 July 2009, the amortisation of ABC2 commissioned programming was amended to be consistent with the amortisation of programming detailed above. The costs of programs produced for radio are expensed as incurred. Such programs are normally broadcast soon after production, stock on hand at any time being minimal. Purchased Programs Purchased program inventory is amortised in accordance with the policy noted above or over the rights period of the contract (whichever is lesser). Subsequent sales of residual rights are recognised in the period in which they occur. Write-down of Merchandise Inventory The amount of any write-down of inventories to net realisable value and all losses of inventory are recognised as an expense in the period the write-down or loss occurs. The amount of any reversal of any write-down of inventories arising from an increase in the net realisable value, will be recognised as a reduction in the amount of inventories recognised as an expense in the period in which the reversal occurs. Write-down of Inventory Held for Distribution When inventories held for distribution are distributed, the carrying amount of those inventories is recognised as an expense. The amount of any write-down of inventories for loss of service potential and all losses of inventories are recognised as an expense in the period the write-down or loss occurs. The amount of any reversal of any write-down of inventories arising from a reversal of the circumstances that gave rise to the loss of service potential will be recognised as a reduction in the amount of inventories recognised as an expense in the period in which the reversal occurs. 1.26 Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Corporation has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, where it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2010 5 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 1472.

Financial Instruments 13.1 Capital Risk Management The Corporation manages its capital to ensure that it is able to continue as a going concern through aligning operations with Government funded objectives.

The Corporation's policies are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in the Corporation's activities. There has been no change in the policies from the previous period. Compliance with policies and exposure limits are reviewed by the Corporation's internal auditors on a continuous basis. To meet the Corporation's financial risk management objectives, surplus cash has been invested into short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities at acquisition date of gr eater than three months. These investments are included as \"other receivables\". The Corporation's Treasury function provides advice and services to the business, coordinates access to foreign currency contracts and monitors and assesses the financial risks relating to the operations of the Corporation through internal risk reports. Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2010 5 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 16113. Financial Instruments continued 13.3 Financial Risk Management continued Where appropriate, the Corporation seeks to minimise the effects of its financial risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge its risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Corporation's policies as approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and investment of funds. The Corporation does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes. 13.4 Market Risk Market risk includes foreign currency risk, which is detailed in Note 13.5: Foreign Currency Risk, and interest rate risk, which is detailed in Note 13.7: Interest Rate Risk. The Corporation is not exposed to any other price risk on financial instruments. 13.5 Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk refers to the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to the changes in foreign exchange rates. The Corporation's activities expose it primarily to the financial risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates arising from transactions and assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency that is not Australian dollars. The Corporation enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge the foreign exchange rate risk arising from some of these transactions. These forward exchange contracts are not designated as cash flow hedges. The Corporation is exposed to foreign currency denominated in United States Dollars (USD), Great British Pounds (GBP) and Euros (EUR). The following table details the effect on the profit and equity as at 30 June from a 14% (2009 12%) favourable/ unfavourable change in the rate of the AUS dollar against the curr encies to which the Corporation is exposed, with all other variables held constant.

Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2010 162 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE13. Financial Instruments continued 13.6 Hedging Instruments Specific Hedges The Corporation enters into forward exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments when exposures of $50 000 or greater (equivalent) are entered into under a firm contract for goods or services involving a specific foreign currency amount and payment date. Exposures are covered if they fall within a set period, which can generally be a minimum of 3 months or maximum of 6 months subject to market conditions. The balance of the hedging reserve in equity reflects a net surplus of $15 162 (2009 net deficit $39 383) on specific hedges of anticipated foreign currency purchases as at 30 June 2010. The Corporation's cash flow hedges were all effective. The following table sets out the gross value to be received under forward exchange contracts, the weighted average contracted exchange rates and the settlement periods of outstanding contracts for the Corporation. Sell Australian Dollars Average Exchange Rate 2010 2009 2010 2009 $'000 $'000 Buy USD Less than 1 year 1 351 1 295 0.8882 0.7423 Buy GBP Less than 1 year 982 51 0.5817 0.4927 Buy EUR Less than 1 year 76 73 0.6544 0.5617 General Hedges The Corporation also enters into forward exchange contracts to cover foreign currency payments when exposures less than $50 000 (equivalent) of a recurrent nature and with varying foreign currency amounts and payment dates are incurred. General cover is generally held between 40% to 60% of estimated exposures for USD, GBP and EUR subject to market conditions. At balance date, the Corporation held forward exchange contracts to buy USD, GBP and EUR. Gains/losses arising from general hedges outstanding at year end have been taken to profit or loss. The net gain of $130 713 (2009 net loss $52 528) on general hedges of anticipated foreign currency purchases from July 2009 to June 2010 has been recognised at balance date through profit or loss. 13.7 Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk refers to the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Corporation is not exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings, as all borrowings are at fixed interest rates. The Corporation derives interest revenue from funds invested, which is impacted by interest rate fluctuations. Although, the Corporation is not dependent on interest revenue to continue operations, a 1.50% (2009 0.75%) decrease in the interest rate would result in a decrease in interest revenue of $2 975 224 (2009 $1 600 698) and a 1.50% (2009 0.75%) increase in the interest rate would result in an increase in interest revenue of $2 975 224 (2009 $1 600 698). The change in interest revenue is proportional to the change in interest rates. 13.8 Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Corporation will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities. The Corporation is dependent upon revenue from Government. In excess of 83% (2009 79%) of normal activities are funded in this manner, and without this revenue, the Corporation would be unable to meet its obligations.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2010 5 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 16313.

Loans from Government are provided on a long-term, fixed interest rate basis. 13.9 Credit Risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Corporation. Credit risk arises from the financial assets of the Corporation, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, available-for-sale financial assets and derivative instruments. The Corporation has adopted a policy of only dealing with credit worthy counterparties and obtaining collateral where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Corporation assesses credit ratings through independent ratings agencies and if not available, uses publicly available financial information and its own trading record to rate customers. The Corporation manages its credit risk by undertaking credit checks on customers who wish to take on credit terms. The Corporation has policies that set limits for each individual customer . Ongoing credit evaluations are performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable. The Corporation has no material concentration of credit risk with any single customer as the Corporation has a large number of customers spread across a range of industries and geographical areas. The credit risk arising from dealings in financial instruments is controlled by a strict policy of credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2010 164 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE13. Financial Instruments continued 13.9 Credit Risk continued The Corporation does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty. The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties ar e banks with credit ratings of at least A- as assigned by Standard & Poors. The Corporation's maximum exposure to credit risk at reporting date in relation to each class of recognised financial assets is the carrying amount, net of allowance for doubtful debts, of those assets as indicated in the Balance Sheet. Credit exposure of foreign currency and interest rate bearing investments is represented by the net fair value of the contracts, as disclosed.

As of 1 July 2009, the Corporation has adopted the amendment to AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, which requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level in accordance with the following fair value measurement hierarchy: Level 1\u2014quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2\u2014inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that ar e observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); and Level 3\u2014inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). The Corporation has no level 1 financial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded derivatives, or trading and available-for-sale securities) that are based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period. The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) are determined using valuation techniques. The Corporation uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at the end of each reporting period. The fair value of forward exchange contracts are determined using a level 2 technique based on the forward exchange market rates at the end of the reporting period. The fair value of forward exchange contracts at 30 June 2010 was $146 000 (2009 $92 000). The Corporation has no level 3 financial instruments where a valuation technique for the instruments is based on significant unobservable inputs. 14.

The Committee did not formally meet in 2009-10 as these matters were dealt with in Board meetings.Appendix 5\u2014ABC Board and Board Committees Audit and Risk Committee The Audit and Risk Committee provides independent assistance to the ABC Board in relation to the Corporation's risk, control and compliance framework, and its external accountability. The Audit and Risk Committee also provides a forum for communication between the ABC Board, senior management and both the internal and external auditors. The Committee met on six occasions during 2009-10:Meeting No.3 2009 30 July 2009 Meeting No.4 2009 24 September 2009 Meeting No.5 2009 30 October 2009 Meeting No.1 2010 18 February 2010 Meeting No.2 2010 15 April 2010 Meeting No.3 2010 24 June 2010Meetings during 2009-10 were attended by Steven Skala AO (Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee), Peter Hurley and John Brown (see Appendix 5, page 178). John Brown was appointed to the Audit and Risk Committee in December 2007 and is not a member of the ABC Board. Committee meetings are also attended by the Chief Operating Officer, Head Group Audit and a representative of the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO). The Chairman of the Board, the Managing Director and other members of the Board also attend Committee meetings.Appendix 6\u2014Audit and Risk CommitteeAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2010 6 APPENDICES 179Appendix 6\u2014Audit and Risk Committee continued At its meetings, the Audit and Risk Committee endorsed the 2008-09 Annual Financial Statements and monitored progress against the 2009-10 Audit Plan. During 2009-10, the Committee reviewed its activity to ensure it appropriately addressed the requirements of the Audit and Risk Committee Charter. The Committee also noted the implementation of audit recommendations by management, fraud awareness initiatives and fraud investigations undertaken. The Committee also dealt with matters related to, and reports from, external audit and the Corporation's requirement to formally report on compliance with the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 . During its meetings in 2009-10, the Committee also endorsed the 2010-11 Audit Plan for approval by the Board, considered and discussed the findings of audit reports and assessed the performance of ABC Group Audit in providing services to the Corporation. The Committee reviewed and endorsed a revised Group Audit Charter for approval by the Board. The Audit and Risk Committee also considered information papers related to risk management, fraud risk, compliance matters and matters related to the preparation and finalisation of the 2009-10 Annual Financial Statements. Group Audit Group Audit provides an independent and objective audit and advisory service which is designed to add value and improve the Corporation's operations. Group Audit helps the ABC to achieve its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes. Group Audit is responsible to the Audit and Risk Committee for contributing to the achievement of the Corporation's goals and objectives by: Assisting management in evaluating processes for identifying, assessing and managing the key operational, financial and compliance risks of the ABC; Assisting management in evaluating the effectiveness of internal control systems, including compliance with internal policies; Recommending improvements in efficiency to the internal control systems established by management; Being responsive to the Corporation's changing needs, striving for continuous improvement and monitoring integrity in the performance of its activities; Facilitating and supporting the integration of risk management into day-to-day business activities and processes; and Promoting a culture of self-assessment and adherence to high ethical standards. Group Audit is responsible for generating and implementing the ABC's Audit Plan, which seeks to ensure that audits focus on key areas of risk to the Corporation. The Audit Plan is endorsed by the Audit and Risk Committee and approved by the Board annually. In 2009-10, Group Audit performed unscheduled reviews at the specific request of management and continued to utilise technology to undertake continuous auditing and monitoring of transactional data. Group Audit also provided advice and guidance on good governance, policies and controls, and provided advice and input on a number of key projects and initiatives being undertaken by the Corporation. During 2009-10, the Group Audit Charter was revised and updated to ensure it aligned with best practice. Group Audit reviewed the processes implemented by the Corporation to support reporting requirements in respect of compliance with the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 . Group Audit continued to operate with a combination of in-house staff and outsourced external providers. This provided access to expertise in specialist areas and supplemented internal resources and experience. It also helped to ensure that the internal audit function continued to be aligned with industry better practice. Coordination with External Auditors Group Audit continued to liaise with the ABC's external auditors, the ANAO and its nominated representative, KPMG, who were appointed during 2008-09. It sought advice regarding proposed areas of focus, the identification of areas of potential external audit reliance on Group Audit and to ensure that there was minimal duplication of audit coverage. In this regard, the ANAO, KPMG and Group Audit developed a Coordinated Audit Plan for 2009-10, highlighting areas of audit coverage and reliance, as well as audit coverage of ABC strategic risk and financial reporting risk areas. Appendices for the year ended 30 June 2010 180 APPENDICESAppendix 7\u2014ABC Advisory Council In 2009-10, the ABC Advisory Council met three times. It made two recommendations and 10 commendations. Advisory Council Members Jane Munro (Convenor) Jaime Phillips Anthony Peters Catherine Prosser Joel BuchholzRosemary Redgen Moira Neagle Victoria Shenstone Craig Wallace Tania Penovic BradberyTaylor Tran Summary of Recommendations, Responses and Commendations 2009-10 Recommendation R1/3/09 ABC Magazines for Children The Council notes that the ABC generates a great deal of excellent content for children such as BtN, Junior Cooks (Delicious), Kids in the Garden (Gardening Australia), ABC Kids and the new ABC3. Council recommends the ABC consider publishing a magazine that utilises this respected children's content, and which covers a range of topics such as music and the arts, food, gardening, science and the environment and current affairs, tailor-made for \"tweens\". Director ABC Commercial: The ABC has previously published magazines for the pre-school market and for older children, including Behind the News, Saddle Club and Roller Coaster . These were published for a number of years, but were not financially sustainable. The magazine market for \"tweens\" in Australia is in significant decline. ABC Publishing currently publishes Fairies and Mr Men magazines. In addition, a number of other ABC magazines contain features specifically for children and their parents including: Delicious Gardening Australia Organic Gardener ABC Commercial is in ongoing discussion with the Television Division about strategies which would extend ABC Television brands\u2014including ABC3\u2014through a number of commercial activities, including related publications such as magazines. ABC Publishing continuously monitors the market to identify suitable opportunities which are aligned with the ABC's Charter and which are sustainable. Recommendation R2/3/09 Radio National Promotion The Advisory Council recommends that end-of- program references to repeated broadcasts on Radio National be kept timely, accurate and relevant. Director of Radio: Radio National management have listened to several recent broadcasts and has been unable to find any examples where references were not timely, accurate or relevant. Radio National is generally very careful about how it packages repeats but acknowledges that such errors might be possible, particularly in programs that require little or no re-versioning for their repeat edition. The network will issue a reminder to all program makers to ensure that repeat broadcasts always contain timely, accurate and relevant references. Commendations Nature Television ProgramsThe ABC Advisory Council commends the ABC on its continual high standard of informative, well-constructed and narrated nature television programs. Recent examples include The Snow Leopard, The Bear Man of Kamkatcha and Nature's Great Events . The Advisory Council would be interested to see more Australian-made nature programs of this standard. Australian Story The ABC Advisory Council commends the producers of the current series of Australian Story . The subject choice has been outstanding, for example Peter Andrews, Nigel Brennan, Rick Richardson and Sir Jack Brabham. Samson and Delilah The ABC Advisory Council commends the recent screening of Samson and Delilah , six months after its global release. Providing broad access to this confronting but honest film by screening it in prime-time on ABC1 demonstrates the ABC's commitment to leading community engagement and debate around social issues impacting on remote Indigenous communities. \"Camel Invasion\" at Docker River The ABC Advisory Council commends the multi-platform coverage of the \"camel invasion\" at Docker River. Council members experienced the story in news bulletins, on radio and television, and through detailed analysis. The proliferation of feral animals is a serious issue for Australia and the Council is pleased to see desert communities and environments showcased. Black Saturday Website The ABC Advisory Council commends the Black Saturday site as an excellent example of the development of innovative technology that allows the ABC to function as Australia's \"town square\". As a repository for archived and current news, personal stories, and ongoing information regarding the recovery and rebuilding of the affected areas, it will prove to be a historically significant community resource.Appendices for the year ended 30 June 2010 6 APPENDICES 181John Clark and Brian Dawe The ABC Advisory Council commends John Clark and Brian Dawe for their astute humour, effective through its simplicity, in providing a light juxtaposition to the serious intent of The 7.30 Report each week. ABC News Breakfast The Advisory Council commends ABC News Breakfast as a high-quality program that has gone from strength to strength, offering a real point of difference in morning television, as ABC News Breakfast does not seek to mirror its commercial rivals. Drawing on an impressive network of ABC international correspondents, ABC News Breakfast showcases cross-platform ABC content. Newsmakers and politicians are a significant focus for ABC News Breakfast and these morning interviews resonate with news services around the country. It is growing into an important news-making program. The viewer is not just turning on to watch the news delivered, but is watching the news being made by the big interviews of the day. Inside the Firestorm The Advisory Council commends Inside the Firestorm as an excellent account of the circumstances that led to the Black Saturday disaster and the people and communities it touched. Factual information and analysis combined with deeply moving personal stories and the creative use of graphics, as well as amateur and professional footage conveyed a strong sense of the intensity of the day. The willingness of participants to share their experiences reflects a high level of confidence in the ABC to present Australian stories in a respectful and rigorous manner. This is an important social document. My Place The Advisory Council commends the program and website of My Place as being exactly the kind of children's content that the ABC should be showcasing. The program is entertaining, inclusive, informative and respects the intelligence of its young audience. The production values across the board are extremely high and the 1998 and 2008 episodes are natural extensions of the book. The website is an outstanding companion to the series with great navigability, interaction and depth of information; an excellent resource for children, parents and educators. Figaro Pho The Advisory Council commends Figaro Pho . This brief but memorable series combined a stylish and original use of animation with a clever concept which addressed childhood fears and phobias in an educative and amusing way. This program represents a superior and well-placed use of short animation with appeal across the generations. The Council appreciates the ABC's role in broadcasting the work of edgy independent and creative production companies from around Australia.

The ABC's performance in this area is measured through: Implementation and auditing of a comprehensive Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) management system Incident and workers' compensation claim statistics Performance against the Comcare National OHS Strategy Targets 2002-12 ABC workers' compensation premium rates. ABC OHS Management System Initiatives The ABC implemented a number of initiatives in 2009-10 to ensure the continued improvement of its OHS management system including: Implementation of the ABC's Health and Safety Management Arrangements (HSMA) in compliance with the OHS Act. The HSMA codifies the framework for OHS consultation within the ABC and the responsibilities of executive leadership, managers and employees in developing and promoting measures to ensure the health, safety and well-being of ABC employees. Development of the OHS Business Plan 2009-2012. The plan sets out a number of initiatives and specific projects to enhance and deliver OHS practices throughout the ABC. These include: -Consolidated and consistent OHS procedures and guidelines under one OHS Policy -Accurate and timely reporting of OHS performance at all levels of the ABC -Enhanced OHS leadership -Improved levels of OHS knowledge and skills throughout the ABC. Specific initiatives include: Coordinated cross-divisional approach to safety and security at events in which the ABC participates, or which it organises or manages. Ergonomic assessments provided to staff on request to promote safe working practices and reduce the incidence of occupational overuse injuries and muscular strains and other injuries. A total of 156 ergonomic assessments were completed in 2009-10, 47 for compensable cases and 23 as injury-prevention measures. Enhancements to the ABC WorkSafe Incident Reporting and Return-to-Work computer modules to monitor safety incidents and better manage the return to work of ill and injured employees. Consolidated quarterly ABC OHS reports to the Executive Leadership Group containing compensation and incident data. Six-monthly consolidated OHS reports to the Board. Updated hazard identification and risk assessment procedures. Ongoing review and development of the ABC A-Z of Safety providing online advice for managers, employees and contractors to manage operational OHS risks. Ongoing electrical appliance inspection, testing and tagging program delivered nationally. Management of injured workers continues to promote early and durable return-to-work outcomes through the implementation of rehabilitation programs, reducing workers' compensation costs and lost time through injury and illness, specifically through: Promoting early intervention in all cases, particularly where an employee is likely to be off work for five days or more Development of return to work plans for all employees that are expected to be off work for more than 10 days to ensure a safe and durable return-to-work outcome Collection and analysis of incident and workers' compensation claims data to identify trends within the workplace. Comcare Improvement Notices Comcare issued no Prohibition Notices or Improvement Notices to the ABC under the OHS Act. The ABC implemented Comcare recommendations based upon investigations of serious injuries or near-hit incidents throughout the year. There were four Comcare investigations during 2009-10. Employee Assistance Program The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) continued to provide and receive wide support to and from ABC managers, staff and families. The rate at which employees and their families used this service in the year to 30 June 2010 was 4.96%, which is a slightly lower utilisation rate than 5.75% for 2008-09. This utilisation rate by the ABC is greater than the average across media and entertainment organisations of 3.38%. The EAP service was accessed in every State and Territory during 2009-10 with reported high levels of EAP awareness amongst staff. This is evidenced by the level of self-referral to the program (58%). EAP reports demonstrate that 71% of issues were personal issues and 29% work-related issues, a decrease in work-related issues from the previous reporting period. The work-related issues were primarily of an interpersonal nature or vocational. Appendices for the year ended 30 June 2010 6 APPENDICES 185The ABC requested 14 specialised trauma sessions during the 2009-10 year for employees who were exposed to significant trauma events where their well-being was likely to be affected (12 sessions in 2008-09). 71% of trauma sessions were pre- or post-briefings for employees posted overseas. The Managers Assist service was accessed by 28 ABC managers during 2009-10. The conflict management services were accessed on seven occasions during the reporting period. Incident and Claim Statistics A total of 250 incidents were logged in ABC WorkSafe in 2009-10, representing a minor increase over the 217 OHS-related incidents reported in 2008-09. Since ABC WorkSafe was implemented in 2005, it has enabled the tracking of serious incidents and identified trends or problem areas allowing preventative strategies to be implemented. This has helped to facilitate an early response to injury management and minimise incident recurrence reducing workplace injury. Of the 250 incidents, 93 claims for workers' compensation have been accepted by Comcare to date. Detailed analysis of the incidents logged in ABC WorkSafe show that 87% of accepted claims were logged in WorkSafe. Of the 13% not logged, 2% were mental stress claims, 1% unspecified and the remaining claims were primarily body stressing. These injuries and illnesses can take time to develop and are not always directly related to a single reportable incident. An analysis of the workers' compensation claims in 2009-10 shows that the main types of injuries contributing to the ABC's workers' compensation premium continue to be body stressing and slips, trips and falls. While there were fewer slips, trips and falls than manual handling injuries, per claim they were more expensive. As a comparison, body stressing accounted for 52% of workers' compensation claims this financial year and 29% of workers' compensation claim costs, while slips, trips and falls accounted for 21% of workers' compensation claims, yet 56% of workers' compensation costs. Over the three financial years, 2006-09, mental stress workers' compensation claims declined. The level of mental stress claims in 2009-10 remained stable with two claims accepted. In 2009-10, mental stress workers' compensation claims accounted for 2% of ABC workers' compensation claims and 9% of workers' compensation costs. In 2008-09, two mental stress workers' compensation claims were reported. This figure has since been revised to eight claims, with six new claims dating back to that period lodged in later periods. The 2009-10 results represent a significant decrease from 2005-06, when mental stress claims were 7% of claims and 32% of actual costs, and from 2006-07, when mental stress claims accounted for 6% of claims and 34% of actual costs. There has been an increase in both the number of workers' compensation claims and in the average workers' compensation total cost (cost-to-date plus likely future costs) of each claim. In 2009-10, the cost was $27 748, compared with $10 626 in 2008-09. The increase in costs reflects both an increase in the number of claims and the type of injury or illness sustained. The cost of the ABC's workers' compensation claims still compares favourably to the Australian Government Agency average total cost of $35 769. The increase in claim costs is also reflected in the average cost-to-date for ABC workers' compensation claims. In 2009-10, average costs per claim were $4 791, compared with $2 419 in 2008-09. The Australian Government Agency average cost-to-date was $6 989. ABC injury prevention activities in the decade between 1998-99 and 2008-09 saw the number of all workers' compensation injury claims at that time reduce by 60% from 148 to 60. This figure is adjusted by Comcare over time to account for retrospective claims. In 2009-10, whilst the injury prevention activities have been sustained and OHS strategies developed and implemented, there has been a 12% increase in the total number of worker's compensation claims and a 40% decrease in weeks lost from work (from 4.31 to 2.5 weeks). There has been a large increase in the 2010-11 Worker's Compensation Premium to $4 545 435 which represents a 139% increase from the previous year, partly as a result of claims for incidents which were incurred but not reported from 2008-09 (see table \"Number of Claims by Mechanism of Incident Group\"). The OHS Unit has developed strategies to promote reduction in the premium level in the next financial year in terms of both injury prevention and injury management. Appendix 13\u2014Occupational Health and Safety continuedAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2010 186 APPENDICESOHS Training OHS training programs specific to divisional OHS risks and hazardous operations programs delivered included: Fatigue management, risk assessment, online ergonomics, manual handling and OHS Induction training packages; Implementation of an OHS-specific module within the ABC \"New Managers\" Training Program to support and encourage good OHS management practices; Online Safety Induction Course to improve accessibility to safety induction information for ABC employees in all work locations; Trauma Awareness Program, developed by the News Division, designed to support staff whose work involves covering and dealing with potentially traumatic incidents.Appendix 13\u2014Occupational Health and Safety continued Number of Claims by Mechanism of Incident Group Average cost Mechanism of Incident to date ($) Financial Year Major Groups (2009-10) 2009-10* 2008-09 2007-08 2006-07 Falls, trips and slips of a person 9 263 21 10(13) 17 21 Hitting objects with a part of the body 1 632 8 4(4) 6 6 Being hit by moving objects 3 962 8 5(7) 9 10 Sound and pressure 0 0 2(2) 1 1 Body stressing 2 913 52 30(40) 47 55 Heat, electricity and other environmental factors 1 958 1 0 2 1 Chemicals and other substances 0 0 1(1) 1 0 Biological factors 0 0 0 0 0 Mental stress 12 320 2 2(8) 0 6 Other and unspecified 28 181 1 6(8) 7 8 All claims 4 791 93 60(83) 90 108 * The 2009-10 data is immature and the ultimate number and cost of accepted claims may differ from the data reported as new claims may be lodged in a later period.

Target 1\u2014Reduce Incidence of Workplace Injury and Disease by 40% There was an increase in the number of incidents during 2009-10. As a result, the ABC did not meet Target 1. A preliminary analysis of the workers' compensation claims in 2009-10 indicates that there was an increase in body stressing, slips, trips and falls, primarily in the ABC's operational areas of production. Target 2\u2014Zero Workplace Fatalities The ABC met Target 2. There were no workplace fatalities in 2009-10.The following results are current as at July 2010. However, due to latency effects and retrospective claims as reported by Comcare, the 2009-10 data must be considered \"immature\" and the ultimate incidence rate, lost time and rehabilitation intervention rate may differ from the information reported. Appendix 13\u2014Occupational Health and Safety continuedAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2010 188 APPENDICESTarget 3\u2014Reduce Average Lost Time Rate by 40% The ABC did not meet Target 3 in 2009-10. There were a number of isolated workplace illness cases which significantly affected performance against this target. Excluding those illness cases, the ABC would have approached the target more closely. Target 4\u2014Reduce Average Time Taken for Rehabilitation Intervention by 90% The ABC did not meet Target 4 in 2009-10. Target 4 measures the average number of weeks after the date of an injury for the injured employee to return to work. Strategies for continued improvement against this target include: Developing and implementing a Quality Assurance program to monitor and better mange return to work plans for all rehabilitation cases Immediate case manager contact with the injured worker, once notified via ABC WorkSafe or referred by their manager.Appendix 13\u2014Occupational Health and Safety continuedAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2010 6 APPENDICES 189Comcare revised down the ABC's workers' compensation premium rate for the 2009-10 year from 0.59% to 0.54%. This was due to an improvement in the rehabilitation of some high-cost claims. However, the ABC's 2010-11 workers' compensation premium rate increased significantly to 1.09% of total salary costs as a result of an increase in compensation claims, including high-cost claims. This is lower than the Commonwealth average of 1.20% of salary costs, and represents a better-than-average performance in injury prevention and management than other Comcare insured organisations in 2009-10. The ABC also compares favourably to the Government average in relation to the estimated average lifetime claim cost. However, the claim frequency is double the All-Government average.Appendix 13\u2014Occupational Health and Safety continued Claim Frequency and Cost Compared to the Australian Government Average ABC 2009 2008 2007 2006 Estimated Claim Frequency (per $m of payroll) 0.32* 0.22 0.28 0.39 Average Lifetime Claim Cost (after capping) $43 760 $18 584 $7 963 $12 969 All Australian Government Premium Paying Agencies Estimated Claim Frequency (per $m of payroll) 0.18* 0.21 0.26 0.39 Average Lifetime $49 600 $41 182 $35 055 $31 384 * Estimate at end May 2010 Development at end February 2010ABC Workers' Compensation Premium Rates ABC Performance Against Australian Government Agencies Combined Premium Rates 2010-11 2009-10 2008-09 2007-08 ABC Premium Rates 1.09% 0.54% 0.63% all Australian Government Agencies Combined 1.20% 1.25% 1.36% 1.55% Compliance with Performance Reporting Framework The ABC is required to report on its performance in meeting the Commonwealth Disability Strategy under two of the designated core government roles of Employer and Provider. Employer Employment policies, procedures and practices comply with the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 . The ABC Disability Action Plan, which forms part of the Equity and Diversity Plan, includes strategies for recruitment, training, development and support. Strategies included in the Equity and Diversity Plan are linked to ABC Corporate plans and policies. The ABC's representation of non-casual employees with disabilities was 8.3% at 30 June 2010, compared with 8.9% in 2009.The ABC's Equity and Diversity in the ABC: An Overview includes references to people with disabilities and a statement about access and equity for people with disabilities. Recruitment and selection guidelines advise on selection processes, merit selection and avoidance of stereotyping, assumptions and discrimination. The ABC Workplace Values and Code of Conduct include references to values that provide for a workplace that is free from discrimination and that promote equity in employment and a workplace that values diversity. ABC Values are represented by the promotion and integration of four key areas: Integrity, Respect, Collegiality and Innovation. ABC employees are required to be aware of and apply the ABC's Workplace Behaviour Policy and the principles of the Equity and Diversity Plan and comply with Australian anti-discrimination legislation. Appendix 14\u2014Commonwealth Disability StrategyAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2010 190 APPENDICESRelevant plans, policies and guidelines are available to staff on the ABC's intranet site. State and Territory People and Learning managers have access to information on external disability organisations, contacts and resources to assist managers and staff. The News and Radio Divisions have provided job opportunities in conjunction with external disability programs. Under an external mentoring program coordinated by the Australian Network on Disability, the Television Division continues to provide support and career advice to a student with a disability, through access to an ABC senior management mentor. Mental Health First Aid Certificate Courses have been undertaken by ABC People and Learning managers and other relevant staff in all States and Territories. Depression awareness seminars open to all staff have been delivered to the majority of States and Territories, with the final State to be covered later in 2010. The Technology Division has tailored a two-day course for managers around Australia that provided mental health awareness training and strategies for managing issues in the workplace. The ABC's online A-Z of Safety site includes a section with information for staff with disabilities. The ABC continued to improve accessibility to its properties for both employees and visitors with disabilities. This has been achieved through the provision of accessible toilet facilities as part of the extension of the ABC's premises at Bundaberg, Queensland and through the provision of tactile indicators and handrails at Hobart and Launceston, Tasmania. Disability issues were an integral component of the planning processes undertaken for the ABC's new buildings in Brisbane, Broome, Esperance and Wollongong. An external resource regarding the preferred terminology and reportage of people with disabilities has been distributed to the News Division as a guide for journalists. Recruitment information for potential job applicants is available in accessible formats on request. Accessible formats are available for potential job applicants and were provided on request during the year by mail, fax, email and online. The turnaround for responding to accessible format requests was usually the same as for other requests. Advertisements have also been provided on the internet. The ABC did not receive any requests from applicants with disabilities for formats other than those already available.The eRecruitment system introduced in February 2010 allows potential applicants to view current vacancies on the ABC website and apply directly online. For those who do not have access to a computer, a postal application or other agreed format will be accepted and manually entered into the system on the applicant's behalf by the National Recruitment Unit. The online application form asks applicants if they wish to identify themselves as a person with a disability and whether they require additional assistance to participate in selection activities. Agency recruiters and managers apply the principle of reasonable adjustment. Information on the principles of reasonable adjustment has been provided to managers and those responsible for recruitment. Both training and information have been provided to ABC State and Territory People and Learning managers and Health and Safety representatives. Research has been undertaken and provided to State and Territory People and Learning managers on case law about disability discrimination, reasonable adjustment and meeting the inherent requirements of work duties. The Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) data collection form includes a question about individual staff needs and adjustments in the workplace for staff with disabilities. Employees who requested assistance were followed up and assisted individually with their needs. A number of staff were accommodated with equipment, facilities and flexible work arrangements during the year. An information sheet has been developed for managers to alert them to the Australian Government workplace modifications program for people with disabilities. Training and development programs consider the needs of staff with disabilities. The ABC's Equity and Diversity Plan includes strategies on training, development and support. Through its performance management system, the ABC ensures that all staff, including people with disabilities, have their training needs identified and addressed. The ABC is a Registered Training Organisation, and is required to meet standards of training and accommodation which are inclusive of people with disabilities. Accessibility issues are taken into account as a matter of course by both Property Services and Capital Works in the redesign or fitout of any space. Appendix 14\u2014Commonwealth Disability Strategy continuedAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2010 6 APPENDICES 191Appendix 14\u2014Commonwealth Disability Strategy continued Training and development programs include information on disability issues as they relate to the content of the program. The ABC's mandatory training program, \"Creating a Better Place to Work,\" continued to be delivered nationally during 2009-10. A total of 5 545 staff, including executive directors and managers, have been trained since its introduction. The workshops cover the areas of diversity, bullying, discrimination, harassment and conflict resolution and provide the opportunity to focus on disability employment issues. Staff induction also includes information on policies and issues relating to diversity, bullying, discrimination and harassment. Complaints/grievance mechanism, including access to external mechanisms, in place to address issues and concerns raised by staff. The ABC's Workplace Behaviour Policy and Complaints Resolution Process are included in a comprehensive webpage on the ABC's intranet. This site includes information on what discrimination, harassment and bullying mean; complaint support and procedures; access to external complaint mechanisms and the appointment and role of employee contact officers. Contact officers receive specific training when appointed. The ABC's employment agreements include provisions for consultation and settlement of individual grievances and other disputes and the performance management system has provision for appeals. A professional counselling service for staff and their families is provided through the ABC Employee Assistance Program (see page 184). Provider Providers have established mechanisms for quality improvement and assurance. Several mechanisms assist with quality improvement and assurance within the ABC, such as the ABC Editorial Policies and the ABC Code of Practice . Importantly, the ABC Editorial Policies cover a range of areas and include content standards on discrimination and stereotypes, with express reference to people with disabilities. The use of the term \"mental illness\" is explained and reference is given to the availability of external resources about portraying people with a mental illness. The content standards also address accessibility. A section in the News content area warns against labelling groups or individuals, so as not to portray stereotypes. The ABC Code of Practice also includes a clause about taking care with the use of language and images so as to avoid discrimination and stereotypes. The ABC Advisory Council also makes recommendations to the ABC Board on programming issues and holds small group consultations to obtain community views on ABC programs and services. The Council includes members with disabilities\u2014see Appendix 7 (page 180). Providers have an established service charter that specifies the roles of the provider and consumer and service standards which address accessibility for people with disabilities. A statement of what audiences and customers can expect in their dealings with the ABC is incorporated in the ABC Service Commitment \u2014see Appendix 19 (page 202). Access for people with disabilities is provided through captioning, accessible television and online. Guidelines have been developed specifically to make ABC Television services more accessible for people who are blind or have a visual impairment or limited reading comprehension. Complaints/grievance mechanism, including access to external mechanisms, in place to address issues and concerns raised about performance. The ABC's Editorial Policies, Code of Practice and Service Commitment include extensive guidelines for dealing with program complaints and the range of methods of lodging complaints. The guidelines include the option for people who are not satisfied with the ABC's response to a complaint about an ABC Code of Practice issue to refer their complaint to an independent body, the Australian Communications and Media Authority. The ABC Editorial Policies allow for alternative arrangements to be made where a person has genuine difficulties, such as a disability, in putting their complaint in writing. A teletypewriter (TTY) facility is available for the purpose of contacting the ABC about services and programs.Appendices for the year ended 30 June 2010 192 APPENDICESThe ABC paid bonuses to 138 executives totalling $732 898, an average of $5 312 per executive.

The Panel did not uphold a complaint made against various editions of two ABC Radio National programs broadcast in June 2008. The complaint related to The Ark and The Spirit of Things , both presented by Dr Rachael Kohn. The complainant expressed concern that on a number of occasions during the month of June 2008, the interviewer displayed \"inaccuracy and pro-Israeli bias\" while presenting both of these programs. The complainant alleged that the programs \"presented a straight Israeli world view, rather than any examination of Judaism in its own right or in relation to the other faiths of the Holy Land\". The complainant believed that both The Ark and The Spirit of Things should have been more analytical and critical of comments made by interviewees. The complaint was reviewed by Audience and Consumer Affairs and the Complaints Review Executive, who both concluded the ABC had met its editorial standards and that the complaint should not be upheld. The complaint was then referred to the ICRP for review. In its final report, the Panel noted that both The Ark and The Spirit of Things were classified as Topical and Factual content to which section 7.4.1 of the ABC Editorial Policies applies. It states, \"[t]he ABC is committed to impartiality: where topical and factual content deals with a matter of contention or public debate, a diversity of principal relevant perspectives should be demonstrated across a network or platform in an appropriate timeframe\". The Panel concluded that Dr Kohn was free, under section 7.4, to create the program she wished and select interviewees appropriate for that program and that it was not to the point to criticise her for not producing a different program with different themes, focuses and participants. No breach of the ABC Editorial Policies was found. 2. The Panel did not uphold a complaint against the ABC's AM program, broadcast on 6 October 2008. The complaint related to use of the term \"disputed land\" in the introduction to a report titled \"Israeli settler violence on the rise\". The complainant asserted that the presenter should have used the term \"Palestinian occupied land\". The complaint had originally been investigated by Audience and Consumer Affairs who found that the introduction to the report used the term \"disputed land\" as a shorthand description of the complex circumstances in the West Bank, that the term was used accurately and in context, and did not breach the ABC Editorial Policies .The complainant was dissatisfied and referred the matter to the ICRP for review. In its assessment of the complaint, the Panel was satisfied that the term \"disputed land\" used in the context of this short introductory passage did not convey any wider or misleading impression. Nonetheless, the Panel recommended that care be exercised in its use in other and wider circumstances. No breach of the ABC Editorial Policies was established. 3. The Panel partially upheld a complaint against The 7.30 Report , broadcast on 25 November 2008. The complaint related to an item broadcast on the subject of domestic violence. The complainant claimed that two false and misleading statistics remained published on The 7.30 Report website that could be misinterpreted by readers. The two statements were made by the presenter in the introduction of the program. The first statement referred to by the complainant was: \"more than one in three Australian women will experience violence inflicted by their partner at some point in their lifetime\". In its responses to the complaint, the ABC identified the research from which this figure was derived. The ABC considered that the figure had been used accurately. In its review, the Panel suggested that the key question was whether a reasonable paraphrase was made of the research findings. The Panel noted that the research had addressed the prevalence of \"intimate partner violence\", which included both ''current-partner violence\" (occurring during a relationship) and \"former-partner violence\" (occurring after a relationship has ended). The Panel noted that the distinction was clearly an important one in the area of domestic violence. In the Panel's opinion, the distinction was not brought out by the use of the words \"at some point in their lifetime\". Consequently the website was found to contain an inaccuracy, and the Panel upheld this part of the complaint. The Panel recommended that the words \"or former partner\" be added to the website. The ABC agreed with this recommendation. The second statement referred to by the complainant was: \"[a]s one insight into an unacceptable national situation, violence is the leading cause of death, disability and illness to Victorian women under the age of 45\". The complainant referred to a range of statistics in support of his complaint that the program should have referred to violence as a \"contributor\", rather than a \"cause\" in this statement. The ABC explained that the program relied on a statement made to the program by the Deputy Commissioner of the Victorian Police Force, but not used in the broadcast. Appendix 17\u2014Independent Complaints Review PanelAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2010 194 APPENDICESThe Panel considered the material available provided a reasonable basis for the making of the statement in the form chosen, and did not uphold this part of the complaint. Notwithstanding this finding, the ABC added an Editor's Note to the program transcript to clarify that the information on violence as a factor in the death, disability and illness of Victorian women came from a VicHealth study which found that \"Intimate partner violence... is the leading contributor to death, disability and illness in Victorian women aged 15-44...\". 4. The Panel did not uphold a complaint against The 7.30 Report relating to its coverage of events in Gaza in late 2008 and the early part of 2009. The complainant suggested there was a \"very noticeable bias\" in the program's coverage and alleged that the Palestinian viewpoint was not presented to balance the views of Israeli representatives. Specifically, the complainant alleged that the program failed to balance an interview with Dr Martin Indyk. The complaint was initially investigated by Audience and Consumer Affairs and was not upheld. The complainant then sought review from the Complaints Review Executive, who was also satisfied that the coverage met ABC editorial requirements. Both responses were unsatisfactory to the complainant. The complaint was referred to the ICRP for review. The Panel noted that a review of The 7.30 Report coverage amply demonstrated that Palestinian perspectives were adequately presented to the television audience. Questions of the cause of the outbreak of hostilities were canvassed, including the previous imposition of the Israeli blockade and its devastating effect on the Gaza economy, after the military takeover by Hamas and its refusal to recognise Israel. Also, the size of the Israeli onslaught, its alleged lack of proportionality, and its effect on the lives and property of innocent Gazans, received adequate exposure. In relation to the complainant's specific complaint that persons named were not interviewed to provide balance to the Dr Martin Indyk interview, the Panel accepted the ABC's response that they \"were largely not considered by ABC News to represent principal relevant viewpoints in the Gaza conflict\". The Panel concluded that the Indyk interview in itself could hardly be described as emotive or provocatively partisan, meriting some in-depth attack from the \"opposite side\", in order to provide a proper degree of balance. The Panel found that the program's coverage met the requirements for balance set out in the ABC Editorial Policies .5. The Panel did not uphold a complaint against two segments on ABC Radio National: the World News Wrap and News , both broadcast on 21 April 2009. The complainant alleged inaccurate representations were made of statements by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, namely a remark that Israel should be wiped off the map. The complainant asserted the President had in fact instead stated that \"the Israeli regime must vanish from the page of time\". The complaint was reviewed by Audience and Consumer Affairs and was not upheld. It was subsequently reviewed by the ABC's Complaints Review Executive who found reasonable effort had been made to ensure accuracy in the translation. The Panel noted material provided to it by the complainant and the ABC. It observed that the speech by President Ahmadinejad showed extreme hostility to Israel. The Panel also noted that Farsi is apparently difficult to translate when metaphorical language is being used. The Panel considered that the President, in asserting that the Israeli/Zionist regime should be eliminated and its stain purged was, in effect, saying that Israel as a nation or political entity should be expunged from the map of the world, that is, it should cease to exist. The Panel found no breach of ABC Editorial Policies . 6. The Panel upheld a complaint against a Lateline segment broadcast on 16 February 2009. The segment set out to examine the fuel reduction debate in the aftermath of the Black Saturday fires. It included an interview with a local resident, as well as comments from the Country Fire Authority's Chief Fire Officer and the Victorian Premier. The complainant felt the segment was biased. He criticised the program for a lack of effort in investigating claims made by the local resident and for failing to present the view of the local council. The Panel identified the complaint as including allegations of inaccuracy, lack of balance and partiality. The Panel therefore reviewed the Lateline item against the relevant standards from section 5 of the ABC Editorial Policies . The Panel noted that, in its initial response to the complainant, the ABC had already acknowledged inaccuracies in the report. Notwithstanding the corrections subsequently made, the Panel concluded that the report failed to meet editorial standards for accuracy because it omitted details which the Panel believed would provide \"an entirely different picture\" of the dealings between the local council and the resident. Appendix 17\u2014Independent Complaints Review Panel continuedAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2010 6 APPENDICES 195The Panel considered that the report needed to include the perspective of the local council in order to meet editorial requirements for balance and impartiality. The Panel also considered that the perspective of the resident's neighbours would have been helpful. They concluded that the issue raised was a distinct one, being the effect of council planning and regulations and their implementation. It was the Panel's view that some input, even if quite brief, was required from the council to achieve a satisfactory degree of balance on this issue. The Panel found that no attempt was made in the program to achieve this through any approach to the council. Also, in view of the reference made to the neighbour's destroyed home in the absence of clearing, the Panel considered that some input of neighbours' views on clearing would have assisted in providing balance. Consequently, the Panel found that the program lacked balance and, in favouring the resident's perspective on this issue, was not impartial. The Panel did not consider it appropriate to make any recommendations for further action on the part of the ABC. 7. The Panel did not uphold a complaint about interviews broadcast on ABC Radio National's The Religion Report on 17 September and 1 October 2008. The complainant asserted that the program had accused an academic of \"having active sympathies with terrorism\" and \"conspiracy in support of and in the future planning of indiscriminate Jihadist murder\", and had then failed to retract these accusations. The Panel identified the complaint as relating to impartiality. The Panel noted that neither program made these charges expressly and was firmly of the view that they did not arise by way of reasonable implication from the words that were in fact used. In its opinion, an ordinary reasonable listener would not have inferred these meanings from the words used. Accordingly, the Panel did not agree that, in order to satisfy the requirements for impartiality, the presenter was required to put these accusations to the academic in the interview with him. The Panel also concluded that the two programs satisfied the requirement for platform impartiality. The Panel noted that it was appropriate that the only named academic, and the focus of much of the criticism, be the chosen interviewee to provide the other side of the story. In the Panel's view, he was given ample and fair opportunity to provide the answers he wished, which he did in an articulate and forceful manner, as evidenced by both the transcript and audio of the program. In doing so, he and the program dealt with \"a diversity of principal relevant perspectives\". The Panel concluded that no breach of the ABC Editorial Policies had been established.8. The Panel did not uphold a complaint against ABC presenter Tony Jones for comments made on ABC Fora , broadcast on 4 September 2008. The complaint related to remarks made by Mr Jones following the presentation of a speech by John Pilger on ABC Fora . Mr Pilger's speech had included criticism of the Lateline program's coverage of issues in the Mutijulu community. It had also subsequently referred to statistics relating to suspected abuse of Aboriginal children in the Northern Territory. Mr Pilger's speech included reference to certain statistics relating to suspected abuse of Aboriginal children in the Northern Territory. Mr Jones' remarks were as follows: \"That was journalist and provocateur John Pilger with an attack on the world's media, including the ABC's Lateline , a show which I regularly present, so you won't be too surprised to hear that in my view, John Pilger's allegations about Lateline are simply wrong. And it's also worth noting that the ABC's Independent Complaints Review Panel dismissed the same allegations after a 14-month investigation, and you can find their report on our website at abc.net.au/fora. I only wish Mr Pilger had read it before making that speech\". In its assessment, the Panel identified the complaint as relating to accuracy. The Panel considered whether Mr Jones' statement conveyed that the Panel, in its investigation of the Lateline program, had dismissed the statistics cited by Mr Pilger. They noted that Mr Jones made no direct statement that the Panel, in its report, had even considered these statistics, let alone refuted or dismissed them. The Panel concluded that the audience could not reasonably have taken Mr Jones' comment as meaning that the Panel had considered, let alone dismissed, the recent statistical information in the course of its investigation. Mr Jones' comment was clearly in answer to what was said by Mr Pilger in the first paragraph of the excerpt cited above. Indeed, the Lateline program provided material from sources other than the \"anonymous youth worker\" and examined the question of \"paedophile rings\" and \"sex slavery\" in a focussed way, which went well beyond the making of \"lurid allegations\". The Panel found no breach of ABC Editorial Policies . 9. The Panel did not uphold a complaint against an item broadcast on the 7pm television News on 27 July 2008. The complaint related to words used by a presenter in the introduction of a news segment about a ceremony held at the Korean War Memorial in Canberra. In the introduction, the presenter stated \"[d]ignitaries have marked fifty-five years since the Korean War ended. Today is the anniversary of the signing of a peace treaty which put an end to the three-year conflict between the North and South Korean regimes\". The complainant suggested it was wrong for the presenter to state that the war had ended and a peace treaty was signed. The Appendix 17\u2014Independent Complaints Review Panel continuedAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2010 196 APPENDICEScomplainant wanted it clarified that \"[f]ifty-five years ago the two sides signed an armistice, not a peace treaty. The difference is that the two sides are still technically at war and the conflict could resume at any time\". The Panel identified the complaint as relating to accuracy and noted the ABC had accepted that a breach of the accuracy provisions occurred when the presenter referred to a \"peace treaty\" having been signed at the end of the Korean War. A correction was posted on the ABC's website. The Panel was satisfied that the ABC had dealt appropriately with this aspect of the complaint. The Panel examined whether the complaint established that a further error had been made in the report in the description of the Korean War as having ended. The Panel noted that it did not find it easy to decide whether an error in the program had been established. It considered that, in light of the materials relied on by the complainant, there may well have been such an error. However, even if it were established, this would still leave open the question as to whether it was a significant error. The Panel was not persuaded that the description of the Korean War as having ended was a significant error that required admission and correction. Accordingly, the Panel did not uphold the complaint. 10. The Panel did not uphold a complaint against the documentary series Rivers and Life which presented six of the most important rivers of the world. The complaint related to an episode which dealt with the Rhine River, broadcast on ABC1 on 27 October 2009.The complainant claimed the program was a disappointment which \"instead of revealing to viewers the complex and fortuitous geography of the Rhine River basin and the deep history of the region... was dominated by war-time propaganda, anti-German sentiment and historical distortion\". The complainant suggested there was no mention of cities such as Cologne, Bonn or Mainz, with their history of Roman origins, or of \"the baroque cities of Mannheim and Karlsruhe\". The suggestion was also made that the complex history of Alsace was inadequately exposed, \"with the narrator trying very hard to explain that Alsace is part of France\", and that too much time had been devoted to Rotterdam. Audience and Consumer Affairs and the Complaints Review Executive had responded to the complaint. Both responses were unsatisfactory to the complainant. The complaint was referred to the ICRP for review. The Panel did not agree that the program was dominated by wartime propaganda and anti-German sentiment. The wartime segments were not historically inaccurate and did not amount to propaganda. There was no anti-German sentiment in relation to post-war Germany. It was the Panel's view that the ABC Editorial Policies did not oblige the producers to take the history any further. There was no fundamental inaccuracy which would engage section 7.4.2. Nor was there any obvious matter of contention or public debate to require the demonstration of principal relevant perspectives as required by section 7.4.1. The Panel found no breaches of the ABC Editorial Policies . Appendix 17\u2014Independent Complaints Review Panel continued Current as at 30 June 2010; last updated 1 July 2008. This Code of Practice summarises the major principles which guide ABC content. 1. Introduction 1.1 The ABC's place in the media industry is distinctive. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 , gives the Corporation particular responsibilities such as the provision of an independent news service. The ABC Charter (Section 6 of the Act) sets out the functions of the Corporation and can be found on the internet at abc.net.au/corp/pubs/charter.htm. 1.2 The ABC Act guarantees the editorial independence of the Corporation's programs. The ABC holds the power to make programming decisions on behalf of the people of Australia. By law and convention neither the Government nor Parliament seeks to intervene in those decisions.1.3 This Code of Practice applies to ABC Radio and Television, Online and other emerging media services. Some parts of the Code apply to a particular medium such as Section 6: Television Program Classifications. Where this is the case material is marked accordingly. 1.4 The word \"content\" is generally used throughout the Code and covers material broadcast on ABC Radio and Television, provided on ABC Online and through emerging media services. 1.5 This Code of Practice sets out the major principles which apply to ABC content. The ABC distinguishes between four types of content: news and current affairs opinion topical and factual performance.Appendix 18\u2014ABC Code of Practice Appendices for the year ended 30 June 2010 6 APPENDICES 1971.6 All four content categories are covered by the general content codes below. In addition specific requirements apply to the content categories of news and current affairs, opinion, and topical and factual. 1.7 The ABC Editorial Policies set out programming policies and guidelines in full and can be found at abc.net.au/corp/pubs/edpols.htm. 2. General content codes 2.1 The guiding principle in the application of the following general content codes is context. What is unacceptable in one context may be appropriate and acceptable in another. However, the use of language, sound or images for no other purpose but to offend is not acceptable. 2.2 This Code is not intended to ban certain types of language or images from bona fide dramatic or literary treatments, nor is it intended to exclude such references from legitimate reportage, debate or documentaries. 2.3 Warnings. From time to time the ABC presents content that it recognises may disturb or offend some of the audience. Where appropriate, the audience will be given advance notice about such content. 2.4 Violence. There will be times when there are genuine reasons for using violent images and sounds to adequately illustrate a story. Particular care must be taken in the presentation or portrayal of violence. The ABC's decision to use such images or sounds should be based on editorial judgement, together with regard for the reasonable susceptibilities of audiences to the detail of what is broadcast or published. Such content should not put undue emphasis on the violent images or sounds, and where appropriate it should be preceded by a warning. 2.5 Language. Variations of language favoured by different groups of Australians are valid and have their place in ABC content. On occasions, the language of one group may be distasteful to another. Use of such language is permitted provided it is not used gratuitously and can be justified in the context of, for example, news, current affairs, fiction, documentary, dramatisation, comedy or song lyrics. 2.6 Sex and Sexuality. Provided it is handled with integrity, any of the following treatments of sex and sexuality may be appropriate and necessary: it can be discussed and reported in the context of news, current affairs, information or documentary programs it can be referred to in drama, comedy, lyrics or fictional programs it can be depicted or implied.2.7 Discrimination and Stereotypes. To avoid discrimination and stereotyping, content should not use language or images which: disparage or discriminate against any person or group on grounds such as race, ethnicity, nationality, sex, age, disability or sexual preference; marital, parental, social or occupational status; religious, cultural or political belief or activity are not representative and reinforce stereotypes, or convey stereotypic assumptions convey prejudice make demeaning or gratuitous references; for example to people's physical characteristics, cultural practices or religious beliefs. The above requirements are not intended to prevent content which is factual or the expression of genuinely-held opinion, or content presented in the legitimate context of a humorous, satirical or dramatic work. 2.8 Privacy. The rights to privacy of individuals should be respected in all ABC content. However, in order to provide information which relates to a person's performance of public duties or about other matters of public interest, intrusions upon privacy may, in some circumstances, be justified. 2.9 Suicide. Suicide is a legitimate subject in ABC content. The depiction or description of suicide must be handled with extreme sensitivity. Care must be taken to ensure that events or methods depicted or described do not encourage others to copy these actions. 2.10 Intrusion into Grief. Sensitivity should be exercised in presenting images of, or interviews with, bereaved relatives and survivors or witnesses of traumatic events. Except in special circumstances, children who have recently been victims of, or eyewitnesses to, a tragedy or traumatic experience should not be interviewed or featured. 2.11 Program Promotions. Program Promotions should be scheduled so as to be consistent with the nature of surrounding content. 2.12 Content for Children. In providing enjoyable and enriching content for children, the ABC does not wish to conceal the real world from them. It can be important for the media, especially television, to help children understand and deal with situations which may include violence and danger. Special care should be taken to ensure that content which children are likely to watch or access unsupervised should not be harmful or disturbing to them.Appendix 18\u2014ABC Code of Practice continuedAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2010 198 APPENDICES2.13 Religious Content. ABC religious content includes coverage of worship and devotion, explanation, analysis, debate and reports. This content may include major religious traditions, indigenous religions and new spiritual movements, as well as secular perspectives on religious issues. The ABC does not promote any particular belief system or form of religious expression. 2.14 Indigenous Australian Content. Significant cultural practices of Indigenous Australians should be observed in content and reporting. 2.15 Television Programs: Closed Captioning on Domestic Television Services for People who are Hearing Impaired or Deaf. Closed caption content will be clearly marked when information is provided to the press or when captioned programs are promoted. Where possible, open captioned advice will be provided if technical problems prevent scheduled closed captioning. Television programs broadcast between 6 pm and 10.30 pm and news and current affairs programs broadcast at any time are captioned in accordance with the Broadcasting Service Act 1992 . Addresses to the nation and events of national significance will also be transmitted with closed captioning. 2.16 Television Programs: Accessible Domestic Television Services for People who are Blind or Have a Visual Impairment or Limited Reading Comprehension. Where material appears in text format on ABC Television, the ABC will endeavour to provide it in audio as well, subject to availability of resources and considerations of creativity, editorial integrity and immediacy. 2.17 ABC Online. The ABC aims to make its online services accessible to audience members who are blind or have a visual impairment. It should however, be recognised that it will not always be possible to achieve this while maintaining standards of creativity, editorial integrity and immediacy. There may also be cases where time or resources limit the ABC's ability to provide this service. 3. News and current affairs content 3.1 This section applies to content categorised by the ABC as news and current affairs in accordance with Section 5 of the ABC Editorial Policies . This content will be accurate, impartial and objective and thereby avoid bias. 3.2 Every reasonable effort, in the circumstances, must be made to ensure that the factual content of news and current affairs is accurate and in context.3.3 The ABC will correct a significant error when it is established that one has been made. When a correction is necessary, it will be made in an appropriate manner as soon as reasonably practicable. 3.4 Content will be impartial. Editorial judgements will be based on news values. One perspective will not be unduly favoured over others. 3.5 Balance will be sought but may not always be achieved within a single program or publication; it will be achieved as soon as reasonably practicable and in an appropriate manner. It is not essential to give all sides equal time. As far as possible, principal relevant views on matters of importance will be presented. 3.6 The ABC will serve the public interest by investigating issues affecting society and individuals. 3.7 Re-enactments of events will be clearly identified as such and presented in a way which will not mislead audiences. 3.8 Television Programs: News Updates. Care will be exercised in the selection of sounds and images used in television news updates and news promotions. Consideration must also be given to the likely composition of the audience. 3.9 Television Programs: News Updates During Children's Viewing Times. Particular care should be taken with scheduled television news updates at those times when programming is directed at children. News updates at such times must not include any violent content. 3.10 Television Programs: News Flashes. Because the timing and content of news flashes on television are unpredictable, particular care should be exercised in the selection of sounds and images and consideration given to the likely composition of the audience. This should be done, notwithstanding the need to get a news flash to air as quickly as possible. Before any news flash during children's and other G classified programs, a visual and audio announcement must be broadcast advising viewers that regular programming will be interrupted with a news flash. 4. Opinion content 4.1 This section applies to content categorised by the ABC as opinion content in accordance with Section 6 of the ABC Editorial Policies 2007 . 4.2 Content must be signposted to audiences in advance. 4.3 The ABC is committed to impartiality and must demonstrate this through the presentation of a diversity of perspectives across a network or platform in an appropriate timeframe.Appendix 18\u2014ABC Code of Practice continuedAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2010 6 APPENDICES 1994.4 Reasonable steps will be taken to ensure factual content is accurate and that content does not misrepresent other viewpoints. 5. Topical and factual content 5.1 This section applies to content categorised by the ABC as topical and factual content in accordance with Section 7 of the ABC Editorial Policies . 5.2 The ABC is committed to impartiality: where topical and factual content deals with matters of contention or public debate, a diversity of principal relevant perspectives should be demonstrated across a network or platform in an appropriate timeframe. 5.3 Every reasonable effort must be made to ensure that factual content is accurate and in context and that content does not misrepresent other viewpoints. 5.4 The ABC will correct a significant error when it is established that one has been made. When a correction is necessary, it will be made in an appropriate manner as soon as reasonably practicable. 6. Television program classifications 6.1 The ABC applies the classifications listed below to all its domestic television programs with the exception of news, current affairs and sporting events. The ABC classifications are based on the Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games issued by the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC), made under the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 . 6.2 Classification of television programs G\u2014General (suitable for all ages)G programs may be shown at any time. This category is considered suitable for all viewers, and includes programs designed for pre-school and school age children. The G classification symbol does not necessarily indicate that the program is one that children will enjoy. Some G programs contain themes or story-lines that are not of interest to children. Parents should feel confident that children can watch material in this classification without supervision. Whether or not the program is intended for children, the treatment of themes and other classifiable elements will be careful and discreet. Themes: The treatment of themes should have a very low sense of threat or menace, and be justified by context. The presentation of dangerous, imitable behaviour is not permitted except in those circumstances where it is justified by context. Any depiction of such behaviour must not encourage dangerous imitation.Violence: Violence may be very discreetly implied, but should: have a light tone, or have a very low sense of threat or menace, and be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Sex: Sexual activity should: only be suggested in very discreet visual or verbal references, and be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Nudity in a sexual context is not permitted. Language: Coarse language should: be very mild and infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Drug Use: The depiction of the use of legal drugs should be handled with care. Illegal drug use should be implied only very discreetly and be justified by context. Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context should be: infrequent, and not detailed, and not gratuitous. PG\u2014Parental Guidance (Parental Guidance recommended for people under 15 years)PG programs may be shown: on weekdays between 8.30 am and 4.00 pm and between 7.00 pm and 6.00 am on weekends at any time except between 6 am and 10 am. PG programs may contain themes and concepts which, when viewed by those under 15 years, may require the guidance of an adult. The PG classification signals to parents that material in this category contains depictions or references which could be confusing or upsetting to children without adult guidance. Material classified PG will not be harmful or disturbing to children. Parents may choose to preview the material for their children. Some may choose to watch the material with their children. Others might find it sufficient to be accessible during or after the viewing to discuss the content. Themes: Supernatural or mild horror themes may be included. The treatment of themes should be discreet and mild in impact. More disturbing themes are not generally dealt with at PG level. Violence: Violence may be discreetly implied or stylised and should also be: mild in impact, and not shown in detail.Appendix 18\u2014ABC Code of Practice continuedAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2010 200 APPENDICESSex: Sexual activity and nudity in a sexual context may be suggested, but should: be discreet, and be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Verbal references to sexual activity should be discreet. Language: Coarse language should be mild and infrequent. Drug Use: Discreet verbal references and mild, incidental visuals of drug use may be included, but these should not promote or encourage drug use. Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context should not be detailed or gratuitous. M\u2014Mature (recommended for people aged 15 years and over)M programs may be shown: on weekdays that are school days, between noon and 3.00 pm; and on any day of the week between 8.30 pm and 5.00 am. The M category is recommended for people aged over 15 years. Programs classified M contain material that is considered to be potentially harmful or disturbing to those under 15 years. Depictions and references to classifiable elements may contain detail. While most themes may be dealt with, the degree of explicitness and intensity of treatment will determine what can be accommodated in the M category\u2014the less explicit or less intense material will be included in the M classification and the more explicit or more intense material, especially violent material, will be included in the MA15+ classification. Themes: Most themes can be dealt with, but the treatment should be discreet and the impact should not be high. Violence: Generally, depictions of violence should: not contain a lot of detail, and not be prolonged. In realistic treatments, depictions of violence that contain detail should: be infrequent, and not have a high impact, and/or not be gratuitous. In stylised treatments, depictions of violence may contain more detail and be more frequent if this does not increase the impact. Verbal and indirect visual references to sexual violence may only be included if they are: discreet and infrequent, and strongly justified by the narrative or documentary context.Sex: Sexual activity may be discreetly implied. Nudity in a sexual context should not contain a lot of detail, or be prolonged. Verbal references to sexual activity may be more detailed than depictions if this does not increase the impact. Language: Coarse language may be used. Generally, coarse language that is stronger, detailed or very aggressive should: be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Drug Use: Drug use may be discreetly shown. Drug use should not be promoted or encouraged. Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context may be shown but depictions that contain any detail should not be gratuitous. MA15+\u2014Mature Audience (not suitable for people under 15 years)MA15+ programs may be shown between 9.30 pm and 5.00 am on any day of the week. MA15+ programs, because of the matter they contain or because of the way it is treated, are not suitable for people aged under 15 years. Material classified MA15+ deals with issues or contains depictions which require a more mature perspective. This is because the impact of individual elements or a combination of elements is considered likely to be harmful or disturbing to viewers under 15 years of age. While most themes may be dealt with, the degree of explicitness and intensity of treatment will determine what can be accommodated in the MA15+ category\u2014the more explicit or more intense material, especially violent material, will be included in the MA15+ classification and the less explicit or less intense material will be included in the M classification. Themes: The treatment of themes with a high degree of intensity should be discreet. Violence: Generally, depictions of violence should not have a high impact. Depictions with a strong impact should be infrequent, and should not be prolonged or gratuitous. Realistic treatments may contain detailed depictions, but these should not be prolonged. Depictions of violence in stylised treatments may be more detailed and more frequent than depictions of violence in close to real situations or in realistic treatments if this does not increase the impact. Visual suggestions of sexual violence are permitted only if they are not frequent, prolonged, gratuitous or exploitative.Appendix 18\u2014ABC Code of Practice continuedAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2010 6 APPENDICES 201Sex: Sexual activity may be implied. Depictions of nudity in a sexual context which contain detail should not be exploitative. Verbal references may be more detailed than depictions, if this does not increase the impact. Language: Coarse language may be used. Coarse language that is very strong, aggressive or detailed should not be gratuitous. Drug Use: Drug use may be shown, but should not be promoted or encouraged. More detailed depictions should not have a high degree of impact. Nudity: Nudity should be justified by context. 6.3 Implementation Guidelines. The time zones for each program classification are guides to the most likely placement of programs within that classification. They are not hard and fast rules and there will be occasions on which programs or segments of programs appear in other time-slots. For example, a PG program or segment of a program designed for teenage viewers could appear before 7.00 pm on a week day if that is the time most suitable for the target audience. There must be sound reasons for any departure from the time zone for a program classification. Programs which are serious presentations of moral, social or cultural issues, may appear outside their normal classification time zone, provided that a clear indication of the nature of the content is given at the beginning of the program. Programs, including those having a particular classification under the OFLC Guidelines, may be modified so that they are suitable for broadcast or suitable for broadcast at particular times. Due to local scheduling arrangements, some programs will be broadcast to Broken Hill outside their classification time zone. 6.4 Television Classification Symbols. The classification symbol of the PG, M or MA15+ program (except for news, current affairs or sporting events) being shown will be displayed at the beginning of the program. The classification symbol of the PG, M or MA15+ program (except for news, current affairs or sporting events) being promoted will be displayed during the promotion. 6.5 Consumer Advice. Audio and visual consumer advice on the reasons for an M or MA15+ classification will be given prior to the beginning of an M or MA15+ program.7. Complaints 7.1 This Code of Practice does not apply to any complaint concerning content which is or becomes the subject of legal proceedings or any complaint about a radio or television program which is made to the ABC more than six months after the broadcast to which it refers. However, please note the ABC cannot guarantee that it will have the necessary tapes to review complaints made more than six weeks after broadcast as this is the statutory period for which the ABC is required to retain radio and television tapes. 7.2 ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs. Complaints that the ABC has acted contrary to this Code of Practice should be directed to the ABC in the first instance. Phone complainants seeking a written response from the ABC will be asked to put their complaint in writing. All such written complaints are to be directed to ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs, GPO Box 9994, in the capital city of the complainant's State or Territory. The complainant will receive a response from the ABC within 60 days of receipt of their complaint. The ABC makes considerable efforts to provide an adequate response to complaints about Code of Practice matters, except where a complaint is frivolous, vexatious or not made in good faith or the complainant is vexatious or not acting in good faith. 7.3 ABC Complaints Review Executive. If a complainant is dissatisfied with a response from Audience and Consumer Affairs, the complainant may request that the matter be reviewed by the Complaints Review Executive (CRE). The CRE is a senior ABC manager with editorial experience, who is separate from Audience and Consumer Affairs and content areas, and who can consider the complaint afresh. Complainants can write to the CRE at GPO Box 9994, in the capital city of the complainant's State or Territory. 7.4 Independent Complaints Review Panel. The Independent Complaints Review Panel (ICRP) is appointed by the ABC Board to review written complaints which relate to allegations of serious cases of factual inaccuracy, bias, lack of balance or unfair treatment arising from ABC content. A complaint of this nature may only be referred to the ICRP for review: if the ABC's normal complaints handling procedures (as described in 7.2 above) have been completed and the complainant is dissatisfied with the ABC's response; or the ABC has not responded within 60 days and the ABC has failed to provide an acceptable reason for the delay; and if in the case of a radio or television program, the complaint was originally lodged with the ABC within six weeks of the date of broadcast.Appendix 18\u2014ABC Code of Practice continuedAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2010 202 APPENDICESAppendix 18\u2014ABC Code of Practice continued Further information can be obtained from the Convener, Independent Complaints Review Panel, GPO Box 688, Sydney, NSW 2001 or by phoning (02) 8333 5639.

If a complainant: does not receive a response from the ABC within 60 days; or is dissatisfied with the ABC's response; or is dissatisfied with the outcome of the ICRP review (as mentioned above) and the complaint is covered by the ABC Code of Practice ;the complainant may make a complaint to the Australian Communications and Media Authority about the matter. 7.6 Contact Addresses Australian Broadcasting CorporationAudience and Consumer Affairs GPO Box 9994, in the capital city of your State or Territory Complaints Review Executive GPO Box 9994, in the capital city of your State or Territory Independent Complaints Review Panel GPO Box 688, Sydney, NSW, 2001 Australian Communications and Media Authority PO Box Q500, Queen Victoria Building, NSW Appendix 19\u2014ABC Service Commitment The ABC Service Commitment is a statement of what individuals are entitled to expect in their dealings with the ABC.

The ABC uses these transmission facilities on a commercial basis for several hours each day to broadcast Radio Australia to selected areas in Asia. The Cox Peninsula shortwave transmission facility near Darwin ceased operations on 31 January 2010. This site had previously been Radio Australia's main shortwave site for broadcasting to Asia. The commercial operator of the site, CVC, gave notice in October 2009 that the facility would close because of a successful Aboriginal land claim on the area. Before Cox Peninsula closed, the ABC was able to relocate Radio Australia's broadcasts to the above off-shore sites ensuring minimal disruption to listeners. Satellite Distribution\u2014Australia Network and Radio Australia Australia Network and Radio Australia are distributed together across the Pacific, south-east Asia, north Asia and south Asia on the Intelsat 5, Intelsat 8 and Intelsat 10 satellites. This makes the two networks available to rebroadcasters and direct-to-home (DTH) across the region.Radio Australia Frequencies continued ABC Head Office Australian Broadcasting Corporation ABC Ultimo Centre 700 Harris 5305Director: Michael MillettCorporate Strategy Ultimo Michael ended 30 June 2010 6 APPENDICES 225Appendix 24\u2014ABC Offices Editorial Policies ABC Southbank Centre 120 8333 Operating Officer: David Pendleton ABC Resources Centre 120 Southbank 02 8333 8333 Radio the year ended 30 June 2010 226 APPENDICESAppendix 24\u2014ABC Offices continued Television ABC Ultimo Offices Capital Territory Canberra Cnr Northbourneand Wakefield AvenuesDickson ACT 2602;GPO Box 4555Fax 02 6275 4538 (Local Radio station: 666 ABC Canberra) Territory Director: Elizabeth McGrath Local Content Manager ACT: Andrea Ho New South Wales Sydney ABC Ultimo Centre700 Harris StreetUltimo 2007; Bega Unit 1, First FloorThe Roy Howard BuildingAyers Walkway 231 Carp Street (PO Box NSW station:ABC Mid North 45 Wingewarra Box (administered Philip Ashley-Brown Nowra (administered Wollongong) England North West)RCM: Jennifer IngallAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2010 6 APPENDICES Wollongong Market 973)Wollongong 02 StreetDarwin NT: Stewart Brash (Acting) Alice Springs Cnr Gap Road and Speed StreetAlice Springs NT 0870;PO Box 1144Alice Springs NT 0871; Phone 8950 station:ABC Territory Radio)RCM: Rohan Barwick (Acting) Katherine (administered by Darwin) Stuart Highway Katherine NT 0850;PO Box 1240 Katherine NT 0851; Phone Radio station: ABC Capricornia) Gold Coast Cnr Gold Coast Highway and Francis Street (PO Box 217)Mermaid Beach Qld 4218; Phone 07 5595 Queensland)RCM: Tom 25 (PO Isa Street 07 Bridget Queensland)RCM: Vicki Thompson Appendices for the year ended 30 June 228 APPENDICESAppendix ABC North Patrick Hession (Acting) South Australia Adelaide85 North East RoadCollinswood SA 5081; GPO Box State Director: Sandra Winter-Dewhirst Local Content Manager SA: Graeme Bennett Broken Hill (administered by ABC South Australia) 454 Argent Street (PO Box 315) Broken Hill 4011Fax 08 8082 Mount Penola Road Box Radio station:ABC South East)RCM: Alan Richardson Port Augusta (administered by Port Pirie) 6 Church Street(PO Box 2149)Port Augusta SA Radio station:1485 by Port Pirie)1/60 Tasman Tce(PO Box 679) 08 8683 2699(Local Radio station:1485 Peninsula 85 Grey Box 289)Port Pirie Radio station:639 ABC North and West)RCM: Andrew Male Renmark Ral Ral Avenue(PO Box 20) Renmark 5341; Phone 8586 1300 Reynolds Local Content Tasmania: 120 Southbank Cameron (Acting) Ballarat 5 Dawson Street South Ballarat VIC 3350; PO Box 7 Ballarat VIC ended 30 June 2010 6 APPENDICES 229Appendix 24\u2014ABC Offices continued Mildura station:ABC Victoria) Wodonga 1 High Street (PO Box 1063) Wodonga VIC 3690; Phone 02 6049 9220 2700Fax station: 720 Perth) State Director: Geoff Duncan Local Content Manager WA: Deborah Leavitt Albany 2 St Emilie Way(PO 9083 2099 (Local Radio station:ABC Goldfields-Esperance)Geraldton245 Terrace 08 Midwest and Wheatbelt)RCM: Andrew Phillips Kalgoorlie Unit 3, Quartz Centre 353 Hannan Street (PO Box 125)Kalgoorlie WA Radio Station:558 ABC Great Southern)Appendices for the year ended 30 June 2010 230 APPENDICESAppendix 25\u2014ABC ShopsAppendix 24\u2014ABC Offices continued Overseas Offices Amman Centre100 Victoria St. West Auckland New Zealand; Phone +64 2 254 Avenue Suite York NY 10017 USA;Phone +1 DC USA;Phone +1 202 466 8575Fax +1 202 5188 Capital Territory Canberra Shop 4620 5007 year ended 30 June 2010 6 APPENDICES 231Castle Hill Shop 28 Castle Towers Shopping CentreCastle Hill Phone 02 9899 2155Phone 02 8882 9179Fax 02 8882 9200 Shop 48 The Albert WalkQueen Victoria Building Sydney NSW 2000 Phone 02 Fax 02 9333 1240 Queensland Brisbane Shop Cairns Shop L01 153Cairns Central Shopping CentreCorner 7539 Appendix 25\u2014ABC Shops continuedAppendices the year ended 30 June 2010 232 APPENDICESAppendix 25\u2014ABC Shops continued Modbury Shop 200Westfield 0933 Victoria South Yarra - Shop 132 Forest Hill Chase Shopping Centre270 Canterbury Road mobile telephone services that are able to carry internet content. app or application \u2014short for \"application software\", particularly in the context of mobile devices.
