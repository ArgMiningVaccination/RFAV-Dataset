ABSTRACT Alzheimer's Disease (AD) continues to be a leading cause of death in the US. As the US aging population (ages 65 +) expands, the impact will disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, e.g., Hispanic/Latino population, due to their AD-related health disparities. Age-related regression in mitochondrial activity and ethnic-specific differences in metabolic burden could potentially explain in part the racial/ethnic distinctions in etiology that exist for AD. Oxidation of guanine (G) to 8-oxo-guanine (8oxoG) is a prevalent lesion and an indicator of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Damaged mtDNA (8oxoG) can serve as an important marker of age-related systemic metabolic dysfunction and upon release into peripheral circulation may exacerbate pathophysiology contributing to AD development and/or progression. Analyzing blood samples from Mexican American (MA) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) participants enrolled in the Texas Alzheimer's Research & Care Consortium, we used blood-based measurements of 8oxoG from both buffy coat PBMCs and plasma to determine associations with population, sex, type-2 diabetes, and AD risk. Our results show that 8oxoG levels in both buffy coat and plasma were significantly associated with population, sex, years of education, and reveal a potential association with AD. Furthermore, MAs are significantly burdened by mtDNA oxidative damage in both blood fractions, which may contribute to their metabolic vulnerability to developing AD.

Online ahead of print. ABSTRACT Adrenal vein sampling (AVS) is the standard procedure for distinguishing unilateral primary aldosteronism (PA) from bilateral PA. In cases where only one adrenal vein is successfully cannulated, it has been suggested that subtype classification can be determined based on the ratio of the concentration of aldosterone between the adrenal vein and the inferior vena cava (AV/IVC index). However, diagnostic performance of the ipsilateral versus contralateral AV/IVC index in predicting lateralization has not been directly compared. In a retrospective cohort of 133 patients with confirmed PA who underwent successful AVS, the performance of the AV/IVC index to predict laterality was evaluated and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves was calculated. In detecting left unilateral PA (n = 47), the AUROC of the right AV/IVC index (RAV/IVC) was significantly higher than the AUROC of the left AV/IVC (LAV/IVC) index (0.967 vs. 0.871, p = 0.008). In detecting right unilateral PA (n = 30), the AUROC of the LAV/IVC index tended to be higher than that of the RAV/IVC index, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (0.966 vs. 0.906, p = 0.08). In detecting left unilateral PA, the sensitivities of the RAV/IVC and LAV/IVC indices were 83% and 46%, respectively, while the specificities of both were above 90%. In detecting right unilateral PA, the sensitivities of the LAV/IVC and RAV/IVC indices were 80% and 43%, respectively, while the specificities of both were above 90%. The AV/IVC index has superior diagnostic performance in detecting contralateral unilateral PA compared to ipsilateral unilateral PA.

We assessed the association between psychosocial risk factors and cognitive function among Malaysian PLWH. Data of virally suppressed PLWH (n = 331) on stable ART, from the Malaysian HIV and Aging study was assessed. Psychosocial factors were assessed using the Lubben Social Network Scale-6 (social isolation) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) with normative standards for the Malaysian population was used to determine cognitive function. Linear and logistic regression were used to assess the associations between cognition, and psychosocial risk factors. Median age of participants was 43.8 years (IQR 37.7-51.0). Participants were predominantly male (82.8%), with secondary education or higher (85.2%). Participants were on ART for 5.7 years (IQR 3.0-9.7), with a mean MoCA score of 24.6 (\u00b13.7). Social isolation was found in 34.6% of participants, and severe depression, severe stress, and severe anxiety in 10.6%, 15.4%, and 6.0% respectively. After adjusting for demographic, clinical, and HIV parameters, MoCA scores were significantly associated with severe stress ( = -0.11, p = 0.02) and having marginal friendship ties ( = -0.13, p = 0.03). Social isolation and severe stress are associated with neurocognitive impairment in PLWH.

ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: A theory-guided Tailored Counseling and Navigation (TCN) intervention successfully increased cancer genetic risk assessment (CGRA) uptake among cancer survivors at increased risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). Understanding the pathways by which interventions motivate behavior change is important for identifying the intervention's active components. PURPOSE: We examined whether the TCN intervention exerted effects on CGRA uptake through hypothesized theoretical mediators. METHODS: Cancer survivors at elevated risk for HBOC were recruited from three statewide cancer registries and were randomly assigned to three arms: TCN (n = 212), Targeted Print (TP, n = 216), and Usual Care (UC, n = 213). Theoretical mediators from the Extended Parallel Process Model, Health Action Planning Approach, and Ottawa Decision Support Framework were assessed at baseline and 1-month follow-up; CGRA uptake was assessed at 6 months. Generalized structural equation modeling was used for mediation analysis. RESULTS: The TCN effects were most strongly mediated by behavioral intention alone ( = 0.49 and 0.31) and by serial mediation through self-efficacy and intention ( = 0.041 and 0.10) when compared with UC and TP, respectively. In addition, compared with UC, the TCN also increased CGRA through increased perceived susceptibility, knowledge of HBOC, and response efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Risk communication and behavioral change interventions for hereditary cancer should stress a person's increased genetic risk and the potential benefits of genetic counseling and testing, as well as bolster efficacy beliefs by helping remove barriers to CGRA. System-level and policy interventions are needed to further expand access.

Online ahead of print. ABSTRACT The United States approached the COVID-19 pandemic with inconsistent responses that varied by state. In Florida, legislators passed laws contrary to mitigating the pandemic. These laws included banning county and municipal efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 through mask mandates, social distancing, and prohibiting vaccination mandates during infectious disease epidemics. Moreover, the Legislature simultaneously prioritized policies of social exclusion, passing bills that constrained the rights of transgender individuals, Black Lives Matter protestors, and educators. In this article, I use the perspectives of critical medical anthropology \"governing through contagion\" to examine Florida's COVID-19 response. I argue the COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity for legislators to obfuscate their political power and advance a politics of social division while simultaneously passing policies that undermined human health. I refer to this process as governing with contagion: Using a pandemic as a politically expedient backdrop to conceal power and simultaneously harm human health.

ABSTRACT IMPORTANCE: Understanding how socioeconomic factors are associated with cognitive aging is important for addressing health disparities in Alzheimer disease. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of neighborhood disadvantage with cognition among a multiethnic cohort of older adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional study, data were collected between September 1, 2017, and May 31, 2022. Participants were from the Health and Aging Brain Study-Health Disparities, which is a community-based single-center study in the Dallas/Fort Worth area of Texas. A total of 1614 Mexican American and non-Hispanic White adults 50 years and older were included. EXPOSURE: Neighborhood disadvantage for participants' current residence was measured by the validated Area Deprivation Index (ADI); ADI Texas state deciles were converted to quintiles, with quintile 1 representing the least disadvantaged area and quintile 5 the most disadvantaged area. Covariates included age, sex, and educational level. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Performance on cognitive tests assessing memory, language, attention, processing speed, and executive functioning; measures included the Spanish-English Verbal Learning Test (SEVLT) Learning and Delayed Recall subscales; Wechsler Memory Scale, third edition (WMS-III) Digit Span Forward, Digit Span Backward, and Logical Memory 1 and 2 subscales; Trail Making Test (TMT) parts A and B; Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST); Letter Fluency; and Animal Naming. Raw scores were used for analyses. Associations between neighborhood disadvantage and neuropsychological performance were examined via demographically adjusted linear regression models stratified by ethnic group. RESULTS: Among 1614 older adults (mean [SD] age, 66.3 [8.7] years; 980 women [60.7%]), [SD] age, 63.9 [7.9] years; 566 women [66.4%]), and non-Hispanic (mean [SD] age, 69.1 [8.7] years; 414 women [54.4%]). Older Mexican American adults were more likely to reside in the most disadvantaged areas (ADI quintiles 3-5), with 280 individuals (32.8%) living in ADI quintile 5, whereas a large proportion of older non-Hispanic White adults resided in ADI quintile 1 (296 individuals [38.9%]). Mexican American individuals living in more disadvantaged areas had worse performance than those living in ADI quintile 1 on 7 of 11 cognitive tests, including SEVLT Learning (ADI quintile 5: = -2.50; 95% = -1.14; 95% CI, -1.60 to TMT A (ADI quintile 5: = 7.85; 95% CI, 1.28-14.42), TMT part ADI quintile = 31.5; 95% CI, 12.16-51.35), 95% CI, -6.77 to -2.14). In contrast, only non-Hispanic White individuals living in ADI quintile 4 had worse performance than those living in ADI quintile 1 on 4 of 11 cognitive tests, including SEVLT Learning ( = -2.35; 95% to -1.43). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, aging in a disadvantaged area was associated with worse cognitive functioning, particularly for older Mexican American adults. Future studies examining the implications of exposure to neighborhood disadvantage across the life span will be important for improving cognitive outcomes in diverse populations.

ABSTRACT PURPOSE: To develop and optimize a method to monitor real-time mitochondrial function by measuring the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in murine corneal biopsy punches with a Seahorse extracellular flux analyzer. METHODS: Murine corneal biopsies were obtained using a biopsy punch immediately after euthanasia. The corneal metabolic profile was assessed using a Seahorse XFe96 pro analyzer, and mitochondrial respiration was assay showed major source of adenosine triphosphate production in ex vivo live murine corneal biopsies. Euthanasia methods (carbon dioxide asphyxiation vs. overdosing on anesthetic drugs) did not affect corneal OCR values. Mouse corneal biopsy punches in 1.5-mm diameter generated higher and more reproducible OCR values than those in 1.0-mm diameter. The biopsy punches from the central and off-central cornea did not show significant differences in OCR values. There was no difference in OCR reading by the tissue orientations (the epithelium side up vs. the endothelium side up). No significant differences were found in corneal OCR levels between sexes, strains (C57BL/6J vs. BALB/cJ), or ages (4, 8, and 32 weeks). Using this method, we showed that the wound healing process in the mouse cornea affected mitochondrial activity. CONCLUSIONS: The present study validated a new strategy to measure real-time mitochondrial function in fresh mouse corneal tissues. This procedure should be helpful for studies of the ex vivo live corneal metabolism in response to genetic manipulations, disease conditions, or pharmacological treatments in mouse models.

The OI craniofacial phenotype includes midfacial underdevelopment, as well as neurocranial changes (e.g., macrocephaly and platybasia) that may also affect underlying nervous tissues. This study aims to better understand how OI affects the integrated development of the neurocranium and the brain. Juvenile and adult mice with OI (OIM) and unaffected wild type (WT) littermates were imaged using in vivo micro-computed tomography (microCT). Virtual endocast models were used to measure brain volume, and 3D landmarks were collected from the cranium and brain endocasts. Geometric morphometric analyses were used to compare brain shape and integration between the genotypes. OIM mice had increased brain volumes (relative to cranial centroid size) only at the juvenile stage. No significant difference was seen in cranial base angle (CBA) between OIM and WT mice. However, CBA was higher in juvenile than in adult OIM mice. Brain shape was significantly different between OIM and WT mice at both stages, with OIM mice having more globular brains than WT mice. Neurocranial and brain morphology were strongly integrated within both genotypes, while adult OIM mice tended to have lower levels of skull-brain integration than WT mice. These results suggest that neurocranial dysmorphologies in OI may be more severe at earlier stages of postnatal development. Decreased skull-brain integration in adult mice suggests that compensatory mechanisms may exist during postnatal growth to maintain neurological function despite significant changes in neurocranial morphology.

ABSTRACT Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a disorder of type I collagen, causes skeletal deformities as well as defects in dental tissues, which lead to increased enamel wear and smaller teeth with shorter roots. Mice with OI exhibit similar microstructural dentin changes, including reduced dentin tubule density and dentin cross-sectional area. However, the effects of these mutations on gross dental morphology and dental tissue volumes have never been characterized in the osteogenesis imperfecta murine (OIM) mouse model. Here we compare mineralized dental tissue measurements of OIM mice and unaffected wild type (WT) littermates at the juvenile and adult stages. The maxillary and mandibular incisors and first molars were isolated from microCT scans, and tissue volumes and root length were measured. OIM mice have smaller teeth with shorter roots relative to WT controls. Maxillary incisor volumes differed significantly between OIM and WT mice at both the juvenile and young adult stage, perhaps due to shortening of the maxilla itself in OIM mice. Additionally, adult OIM mice have significantly less crown enamel volume than do juveniles, potentially due to loss through wear. Thus, OIM mice demonstrate a dental phenotype similar to humans with OI, with decreased tooth size, decreased root length, and accelerated enamel wear. Further investigation of dental development in the OIM mouse may have important implications for the development and treatment of dental issues in OI patients.

ABSTRACT Compensatory mechanisms that augment dopamine (DA) signaling are thought to mitigate onset of hypokinesia prior to major loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in striatum that occurs in Parkinson's disease. However, the identity of such mechanisms remains elusive. In the present study, the rat nigrostriatal pathway was unilaterally-lesioned with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to determine whether differences in DA content, TH protein, TH phosphorylation, or D1 receptor expression in striatum or substantia nigra (SN) aligned with hypokinesia onset and severity at two time points. In striatum, DA and TH loss reached its maximum (>90%) 7 days after lesion induction. However, in SN, no DA loss occurred, despite ~60% TH loss. Hypokinesia was established at 21 days post-lesion and maintained at 28 days. At this time, DA loss was ~60% in the SN, but still of lesser magnitude than TH loss. At day 7 and 28, ser31 TH phosphorylation increased only in SN, corresponding to less DA versus TH protein loss. In contrast, ser40 TH phosphorylation was unaffected in either region. Despite DA loss in both regions at day 28, D1 receptor expression increased only in lesioned SN. These results support the concept that augmented components of DA signaling in the SN, through increased ser31 TH phosphorylation and D1 receptor expression, contribute as compensatory mechanisms against progressive nigrostriatal neuron and TH protein loss, and may mitigate hypokinesia severity.

ABSTRACT PURPOSE: With the inclusion of primary HPV testing in 2018 U.S. Preventive Services Taskforce guidelines, at-home HPV self-sampling may provide a future option for cervical cancer screening, especially among hard-to-reach populations in the U.S. This study evaluated the association of implementation preferences with the willingness of at-home HPV self-sampling. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 2018 among U.S. women ages 30-65 years, without a hysterectomy (n = 812). The outcome was willingness to have at-home HPV self-sampling (yes/no). Primary predictor variables (i.e., information source, methods of payment, methods of sending or receiving self-sampling kits) measured self-sampling implementation preferences. Adjusted logistic regression identified associations with willingness to have at-home HPV self-sampling. RESULTS: Participants who preferred receiving information from healthcare providers (OR = 2.64; 95% CI 1.54,4.52) or from media or other sources (OR = 2.30; 95% CI 1.51,3.48) had higher HPV self-sampling willingness than participants who did not prefer those sources. Participants who did not want to pay for self-sampling (OR = 0.21; 95% CI 0.14,0.32) or did not know if they would pay for self-sampling (OR = 0.35; 95% CI 0.22,0.54) had lower odds of HPV self-sampling willingness compared to participants willing to pay. Participants who did not know which method they preferred for receiving a self-sampling kit (OR = 0.15, 95% CI 0.07,0.31) or preferred delivering the sample to the lab themselves (OR = 0.59; 95% CI 0.36,0.96) had lower odds for self-sampling willingness compared to participants who preferred the mail. CONCLUSION: Understanding the preferences of women regarding the implementation of HPV self-sampling can improve uptake in cervical cancer screening, especially among hard-to-reach populations.

ABSTRACT PTSD with disturbed hepatic metabolism. Neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction is considered a determinant of PTSD, but a link between hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction and hepatic damage in PTSD has not been demonstrated. Thus, the effects of experimental PTSD on the livers of high anxiety (HA) and low anxiety (LA) rats were compared, and mitochondrial determinants underlying the difference in their hepatic damage were investigated. Rats were exposed to predator stress for 10 days. Then, 14 days post-stress, the rats were evaluated with an elevated plus maze and assigned to HA and LA groups according to their anxiety index. Experimental PTSD caused dystrophic changes in hepatocytes of HA rats and hepatocellular damage evident by increased plasma ALT and AST activities. Mitochondrial dysfunction was evident as a predominance of small-size mitochondria in HA rats, which was positively correlated with anxiety index, activities of plasma transaminases, hepatic lipids, and negatively correlated with hepatic glycogen. LA rats had a predominance of medium-sized mitochondria. Thus, we show links between mitochondrial dysfunction, hepatic damage, and heightened anxiety in PTSD rats. These results will provide a foundation for future research on the role of hepatic dysfunction in PTSD pathogenesis.

ABSTRACT Elevated intraocular pressure is considered a major cause of glaucomatous retinal neurodegeneration. To facilitate a better understanding of the underlying molecular processes and mechanisms, we report a study focusing on alterations of the retina proteome by induced ocular hypertension in a rat model of the disease. Glaucomatous processes were modeled through sclerosing the aqueous outflow routes of the eyes by hypertonic saline injections into an episcleral vein. Mass spectrometry-based quantitative retina proteomics using a label-free shotgun methodology identified over 200 proteins significantly affected by ocular hypertension. Various facets of glaucomatous pathophysiology were revealed through the organization of the findings into protein interaction networks and by pathway analyses. Concentrating on retinal neurodegeneration as a characteristic process of the disease, elevated intraocular pressure-induced alterations in the expression of selected proteins were verified by targeted proteomics based on nanoflow liquid chromatography coupled with nano-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry using the parallel reaction monitoring method of data acquisition. Acquired raw data are shared through deposition to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (PXD042729), making a retina proteomics dataset on the selected animal model of glaucoma available for the first time.

ABSTRACT According to the Institute of Medicine, immediate steps must be taken across the United States to educate and train the healthcare workforce to work collaboratively to address the needs of the growing older adult population. The Geriatric Practice Leadership Institute (GPLI) was designed to support professional teams working in acute and post-acute care in transforming their organization into a designated Age-Friendly Health System. The program was built around the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Age-Friendly Health Systems 4Ms framework. This framework focuses on What Matters, Medication, Mentation, and Mobility (the 4Ms) in supporting care for older adults. The GPLI program is an online, seven-month team-based program with four to seven participants from one organization per team. Additionally, each team selected, developed, and completed a quality improvement project based on Age-Friendly Health Systems 4Ms. The curriculum also includes organizational culture, leadership, and interprofessional team-building modules. Using a post-completion survey, the experiences of 41 participants in the GPLI program were assessed. All respondents found the information in the program 'very' or 'extremely' valuable, and their executive sponsor 'very' or 'extremely' valuable in supporting their team's involvement and project. The GPLI program has trained over 200 healthcare professionals and teams that have successfully implemented projects across their organizations.

ABSTRACT Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) encompasses cognitive disorders associated with cerebrovascular disease, often manifesting as white matter lesions (WMLs), irrespective of precise triggers. The integrity of white matter is essential for neural communication and cognitive function maintenance. Persistent cerebral hypoperfusion-induced WMLs are now acknowledged as a key driver of VCI and dementia, though their exact formation mechanism remains unclear. Recent studies link pericyte dysfunction to diverse brain disorders like Alzheimer disease. However, the exact pathological connection between pericyte dysfunction and cognitive impairment in VCI remains unexplored. In this study, we aimed to examine whether pericyte dysfunction could impact WMLs and cognitive impairment in a rat VCI model. Using a rat model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion-induced VCI through two-vessel occlusion (2VO), we verified that 2VO induced both WMLs and cognitive impairment. Notably, the number of pericytes in the brain was significantly altered after 2VO. Furthermore, we observed significantly increased capillary constrictions at pericyte bodies in the brains of 2VO-induced rats compared to sham-operated rats, accompanied by reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF). To tackle this issue, we administered CGS21680, a specific adenosine A2A subtype receptor agonist, intranasally twice a day for 7 days. We found that rats treated with CGS21680 exhibited a significant increase in CBF at 7 and 14 days after 2VO, compared to the vehicle group. Moreover, capillary lumens beneath pericytes also increased after the CGS21680 treatment. Importantly, the treatment led to substantial improvements in WMLs and cognitive impairment compared to the vehicle group. Our findings suggest a critical role of pericyte dysfunction in WMLs and cognitive impairment within the rat VCI model. This insight contributes to our understanding of pathogenesis and offers prospects for targeted intervention in | DOI: [10.14336/AD.2023.0728](https://doi.org/10.14336/AD.2023.0728) in a Pediatric Hospital](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37611248/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=None&utm_content=16_WQa8IGXX9fmpH5rxBvn2P3AGLj7iA4cxn4F_8UATNOHD1kf&fc=None&ff=20230823194748&v=2.17.9.post6+86293ac) J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2023 Aug 23. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000002746.

A HLH multidisciplinary team was implemented at our institution, and we established an electronic order set to foster uniformity in the diagnostic approach. The goal of this study is to capture the impact of this diagnostic tool. METHODS: This is a retrospective study analyzing the utilization of a HLH-specific order set since time of implementation in June 2019 through December 2022. The trends in the utilization of the order set by providers were analyzed to evaluate the awareness and effectiveness of this tool. RESULTS: The order set was utilized 50 times, most commonly by hematology/oncology (50%) and infectious disease (26%). Utilization by providers on newly presenting patients included 4 times in the year 2019, 12 times in 2020, 16 times in 2021, and 18 times in 2022. Utilization was associated with the diagnosis of HLH in 9 patients (18%). CONCLUSION: Implementation of an HLH-specific order set facilitated a systematic method to approach patients with suspected HLH. The utilization of the order set displayed an upward trend over time, indicating support of this tool among these providers. This tool can increase awareness and early identification of HLH.

ABSTRACT This report examines the efficacy of platelet releasate injection as a treatment method for ulnar neuritis. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP), an autologous product of concentrated platelets, has the potential to accelerate healing in injured peripheral nerves by releasing growth factors that promote nerve repair. Platelet releasate, the supernatant of thrombin-activated PRP, has yet to be thoroughly investigated as a treatment option for ulnar neuritis. In this report, a 42-year-old female patient presented with right-sided elbow and neck pain that was subsequently diagnosed as ulnar neuritis and neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. Initial imaging at the right elbow demonstrated ulnar nerve entrapment within the arcade of Struthers. The patient's symptoms were first managed with home exercise and ulnar nerve hydrodissection at the elbow, which decreased but did not resolve her pain. Platelet releasate injection of the ulnar nerve at the elbow was subsequently performed. Six weeks post-procedure, the patient reported additional pain improvement. Provocative tests at the elbow were negative and imaging demonstrated a normal-appearing ulnar nerve. Despite these results, the patient was not completely symptom-free; persistent symptoms were attributed to her concomitant neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. While platelet releasate injection has not previously been explored as a treatment option for ulnar neuritis, this case demonstrates how platelet releasate injection may facilitate healing in an ulnar nerve injured by entrapment. Further investigation could support platelet releasate injection as an effective monotherapy or as an adjunct treatment for ulnar neuritis and DOI: intervention to increase uptake of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy in women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variant: The PREVENT randomized controlled trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37602539/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=None&utm_content=16_WQa8IGXX9fmpH5rxBvn2P3AGLj7iA4cxn4F_8UATNOHD1kf&fc=None&ff=20230821135952&v=2.17.9.post6+86293ac) Cancer Med. 2023 Aug 21. doi: 10.1002/cam4.6417.

ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a theory-based behavioral intervention delivered by genetic counselors on the uptake of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) at 12 and 24 months by women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variant (PV) compared to women who received usual care. METHODS: In this two-arm, multi-site randomized controlled trial participants were randomized to receive a theoretically-guided behavioral telephone intervention or usual care. Outcome data were collected at 12 and 24 months. Participants in the usual care arm were offered the intervention after 12 months. RESULTS: Data on 107 participants were included in the analysis. There was no significant difference in the proportion of women who had a RRSO by 1 year (28.6%- intervention; 22.9%- usual care (p = 0.54)). At 1 year, women who received the intervention had significantly lower mean decisional conflict (pinteraction <0.001) and a higher mean knowledge score at one-year compared to usual care (pinteraction <0.001). At 2 years, 53.9% of participants in the intervention arm had RRSO compared to 32.6% in usual care (p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A theory-based behavioral intervention delivered by genetic counselors to women with a BRCA PV who chose not to have the recommended RRSO was effective at reducing decisional conflict and increasing knowledge in women with a of three benzofuran compounds in comparison to abused psychostimulants](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37600151/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=None&utm_content=16_WQa8IGXX9fmpH5rxBvn2P3AGLj7iA4cxn4F_8UATNOHD1kf&fc=None&ff=20230821075230&v=2.17.9.post6+86293ac) Drug Alcohol Depend Rep. 2023 Aug 5;8:100182. doi: 10.1016/j.dadr.2023.100182. eCollection 2023 Sep. ABSTRACT AIMS: Benzofurans are recreationally, due their ability to cause psychostimulant and/or entactogenic effects, but unfortunately produce substantial adverse effects, including death. benzofurans 5-(2-aminopropyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (5-APDB), 5-(2-aminopropyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (5-MAPB) and 6-(2-aminopropyl) benzofuran (6-APB) were determine their behavioral effects in comparison with 2,3-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), cocaine, and methamphetamine. METHODS: Locomotor activity was tested in groups of 8 male Swiss-Webster mice in an open-field task to screen for locomotor stimulant or depressant effects and to identify behaviorally active doses and times of peak effect. Discriminative stimulus effects were tested in groups of 6 male Sprague-Dawley rats trained to discriminate MDMA (1.5 mg/kg), cocaine (10 mg/kg), or methamphetamine (1 mg/kg) from saline using a FR 10 for food in a two-lever operant task. RESULTS: In the locomotor activity test, MDMA (ED50 = 8.34 mg/kg) produced peak stimulant effects 60 to 80 min following injection. 5-MAPB (ED50 = 0.92 mg/kg) produced modest stimulant effects 50 to 80 min after injection, whereas 6-APB (ED50 = 1.96 mg/kg) produced a robust stimulant effect 20 to 50 min after injection. 5-APDB produced an early depressant phase (ED50 = 3.38 mg/kg) followed by a modest stimulant phase (ED50 = 2.57 mg/kg) 20 to 50 min after injection. In the drug discrimination tests, 5-APDB (ED50 = fully substituted in MDMA-trained rats, whereas only 5-MAPB fully substituted for cocaine, and no compounds fully substituted for methamphetamine. CONCLUSIONS: The synthetic benzofuran compound 5-APDB and 5-MAPB produced weak locomotor effects, whereas 6-APB produced robust locomotor stimulant effects. All compounds were more potent than MDMA. All three compounds fully substituted in MDMA-trained rats suggesting similar subjective effects. Taken together, these results suggest that these benzofuran compounds may have abuse liability as substitutes for [37600151](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37600151/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_content=16_WQa8IGXX9fmpH5rxBvn2P3AGLj7iA4cxn4F_8UATNOHD1kf&ff=20230821075230&v=2.17.9.post6+86293ac) posttraumatic stress disorder in a treatment-seeking sample of US firefighters and emergency medical technicians](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37595896/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=None&utm_content=16_WQa8IGXX9fmpH5rxBvn2P3AGLj7iA4cxn4F_8UATNOHD1kf&fc=None&ff=20230819123153&v=2.17.9.post6+86293ac) J Affect Disord. 2023 Aug 16:S0165-0327(23)01048-0. doi: 10.1016/j.jad.2023.08.068. Online ahead of print. ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: First responders, including firefighters and emergency medical technicians (EMTs), are under extreme stress from repeated exposure to potentially traumatic events. To optimize treatment for this population, it is critical to understand how the various posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom factors are associated with one another so these relations may be targeted in treatment. METHOD: Using a sample of treatment-seeking firefighters/EMTs (N = 342), we conducted a partial correlation network analysis of the eight-factor model. A Bayesian directed acyclic graph (DAG) was used to estimate causal associations between clusters. RESULTS: Approximately 37 % of the sample screened positive for probable PTSD. Internal re-experiencing and external re-experiencing had the strongest edges. In the DAG, internal re-experiencing was the parent node and was potentially predictive of external re-experiencing, negative affect, dysphoric arousal, and avoidance. LIMITATIONS: Data were drawn from a treatment-seeking sample that may not generalize to all firefighters/EMTs. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings are consistent with prior research suggesting re-experiencing plays a critical role in developing and maintaining PTSD symptoms. Future research should investigate non-treatment-seeking first responders, as well as EMTs and firefighters as "}
