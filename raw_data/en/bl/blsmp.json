BREAKDOWNS, BREAKUPS AND BREAKTHROUGHS: ESTELLE BINGHAM When you are running on zero, feeling physically, emotionally and metally defeated, Estelle Bingham is the healer to get you out of your funk and restore your hope, thanks to her uncanny talent for finding the root of problems and illnesses, deep-seated emotional issues and bad habits. And it works quickly. What is quite amazing is Estelle's healing technique: there are no consultations or conversations to find out what brought you to see her. Instead, she tunes into her psychic skills to pinpoint the exact issue, as you lie down on her couch, with huge chunks of crystals placed on various points of your body. Bingham is particularly strong on opening and healing your heart and getting you to, ultimately, love yourself. And while everyone reacts differently, be prepared for the physical side effects too, which might leave you feeling spaced-out and weepy. Her devotees attest that the outcome of her sessions are always an enriching and eye-opening experience, so it's no surprise that it can be hard to get an appointment straight away. Book now.

TRANSFORMATION: EDDY ELSEY Seeing as, right now, we cannot travel to the depths of Peru, the ashrams of India or make a weeklong retreat in Ubud to realign mind, body and soul, as part of the Mandrake's newest holistic spa programme, 'The Soul Reset', you can hole up in their loft-style rooms and enjoy a range of esoteric treatments from some of the best spiritual practitioners in the country, even just for a weekend. Dynamic and proactive in his therapy, Eddy Elsey is a no nonsense, straight talking, shamanic healer, who splits his time between the Midlands and as a resident spiritual practitioner at the Mandrake. Combining shamanism and his own philosophical teachings, Elsey prepares you for sessions, where you are stripped back to your purest self - no sex, drugs, alcohol for 24 hours before the session, and no perfume or makeup on the day of the healing. Whether on a distant healing or in person at the Mandrake hotel, Shaman Eddy is exacting and works quickly, tapping into your body and spirit - his sessions are intense, from the consultation to the drumming and calling on his spirit team and yours, bringing clients on a deep experiential journey. Afterwards, things just seem to shift, dreams are often intense and prophetic, and lots of weird synchronicities seem to happen around you. Of course, it's a strange experience, but Elsey's down to earth manner keeps you in check, plus he equips you with all the spiritual tools to be able to approach life's crossroads with a new perspective. Even after just one session (unless it's special circumstances, Elsey does not like to see clients again for at least two months), the end result is on point - and somewhat life-changing.

QI GONG: PER VAN SPALL A spiritual tour de force, Qi Gong Master Per sets you on the path to peak condition: mentally, physically and emotionally. When he is not working from the Como Shambhala retreat in Bali, you can catch him at Como Metropolitan London. A nirvana of holistic healing, this urban retreat has Como's signature fresh ginger tea on tap to gently ease you into a more meditative state as you talk Per through what you would like to achieve from this session. Per always gets his clients to take a good, long look at themselves, including your posture in front of a mirror before he starts to work on you. An ancient practice stretching back more than 6,000 years, Qi Gong is based on energy work that opens you up to your truest nature and removes the blocks that keep your natural life force from flowing freely - a powerful tool for combating stress and bolstering immune systems. First, Per gets his clients to take a long look at themselves (including their posture in front of the mirror) and then the magic begins. Afterwards, you feel as though you've emerged from a holistic car wash: brighter, noticeably less bloated, generally glowing and just high on life. For maximum results, book yourself in for an Indian Head Massage directly after your Qi Gong session, to ground you and heighten the euphoric effects of Per's transformative energy work.

AN AYURVEDIC OVERHAUL: NATALIE EVE Muscles hum following this Mauli Time treatment from Natalie Eve at the Bulgari hotel. One of the industry's most knowledgeable Ayurvedic specialists and ambassador for the beauty brand, Mauli (the prettiest and most powerful ayurvedic products, including the best Hilamalayn and rose quartz bath salts), Eve's two-hour sessions are next level blissed-out affairs: from the in-depth consultation, where you will find out your dosha type, to her signature deep massage strokes along your marma points, where you are drizzled in different oils all over your body, and then massaged along the spine, your legs and arms - throw in some hot stones, crystal massage, reiki, Indian head massage and a pada abhyanga (foot massage), for an out-of-body-experience. Eve's understanding of the emotional language of the body is unique, where by applying degrees of manipulation, she releases long-held trauma and hidden emotion, and just relief of deep tensions and stress. You leave feeling energised, emotionally grounded and spiritually replete. The sybaritic sense of space at the Bulgari, with its fabulous pool and loft-style treatment rooms, combined with soothing Ayurvedic pastes, oils and tonics, plus Natalie's phenomenal holistic understanding of mind, body and soul, makes this, without a shadow of a doubt, the best healing ritual in London. [bulgarihotels.com](https://www.bulgarihotels.com); natalieevelondon@gmail.com BEST FOR...RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW: LIZ KING'Soul Alchemist' is the enigmatic title that this renowned seeress goes by. Working with her phenomenal psychic skills to tap into whatever is going on around you, Liz King cannot be beaten for her spookily on-point advice on past, present and future situations, from career counselling to navigating a divorce, buying or selling properties and general love life conundrums. Thanks to her kind and calming manner, you instantly feel at ease. For best results (without a trip to her practice in Rutland, or monthly base in Soho), nothing beats an over-the- phone session in the jewel-box surroundings of the Fumoir of Claridge's, accompanied by a pot of Lapsang Souchong. Here, the concentration of crystal (Lalique, naturally) and 'good energy' is the densest. If you crave time to pause and reflect on King's prophetic words amid great luxury, this is the place. sanctuary1960@aol.co.uk BEST FOR... HEARTBREAK: KRISTINA EVANS While there is never a quick fix for emotional issues, the ancient Mayan ritual of a cacao ceremony can definitely help heal the heart-sore by shifting emotional blocks and improving self-love. Cacao is a non-psychoactive yet deeply powerful transformational remedy that is an integral part of healer Kristina Evans' monthly rituals, which combine sound healing, guided meditation, a thorough smudge (a spiritual cleanse that involves being wafted with palo santo smoke) and breathwork. During the two-hour sessions, following drinking a cup of dark sludgy hot chocolate (incredibly bitter not sweet), everything seems bathed in an endorphin-charged glow, it's intoxicating and you become an observer of your emotions, as you lose yourself in a flowing slipstream of sound. Kristina does group sessions from her house in West London, alongside private sessions for manifestation work, visualisation and healings inspired by Peruvian spiritual medicine, which helps you make sense of the bigger picture and leaves you feeling stronger and with an understanding of just being kinder to yourself.

TOTAL RELEASE: ANNIE PENNY Expect to feel transformed under the skilled hands of Annie Penny, the most calming and quietly powerful healer, who specialises in an Emotional Freedom Technique known as 'tapping', which involves targeting your energy channels (chakra points) and gently hitting your meridian points all over your body, from your face and third eye and along your heart, collar bone, hands and stomach. Surrounded by crystals, Annie's hour sessions begin by thinking of what it is you want to remove from your life, which might include any emotional or physical blocks you might be aware of, repeating affirmations, incantations and a statement of exactly what you want to release, followed by her 'tapping' technique. You might feel disorientated to start with, followed by intense tiredness after the session, but over the next few days feelings of clarity and joy rise, and even months on, you can still feel the deeply enlightening effects of the treatment. Annie operates from her London base in Queensgate Terrace, but don't miss her legendary chakra courses at her dreamy Cotswolds bolthole.

Whitfield, who works at London's most glamorous wellness emporium, Glow Bar, combines lymphatic drainage massage technique, a mix of naturopathic oils and the use of rose quartz crystals in her sessions, which eliminate wrinkles and gives youthful dewiness without surgery. Make sure to have an infra-red sauna afterwards and Glow Bar's signature Moon Milks (made with adaptogens), which will no doubt see guests' skin gleaming and feeling drenched "}
