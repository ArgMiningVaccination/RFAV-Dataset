She has a complicated brain tumor and many hormone problems, which have been challenging to manage. Dr. Ronsley is very knowledgeable about our child's diagnosis and explained everything very clearly to us right for the beginning. Dr. Ronsley has been so kind and so patient in answering all of our questions. She works together with our endocrinologist to make sure the care is coordinated and we heard from the endocrinologist that Dr. Ronsley is an expert in this particular diagnosis - we feel so lucky to have her caring for our daughter! She is so humble, and never in a rush and is wonderful with our daughter and always prioritizes making her feel comfortable in the appointment. - Dr. Ronsley is our son's oncologist and she is absolutely wonderful. She is highly intelligent and clearly knows the field and we trust her completely. She is patient and makes sure that we understand everything she is saying. I know that she will leave no stone unturned when it comes to our son's care. She is also great with our son - she is kind and thoughtful and really tries to ensure that he is comfortable every visit. He started his oncology journey scared and would scream every time someone came in the room, but Dr. Ronsley worked hard to make visits \"fun\" and now he smiles and is excited to see her - he absolutely loves her! thank you, Dr. Ronsley, for everything you do! - - Award Name Award Description Awarded By Award Date Department of Pediatrics Best Fellow Research Award University of British Columbia 2021 Department of Pediatrics Best Fellow Research Award University of British Columbia 2018 Dr. John Dupre Award Canadian Society for Endocrinology and Metabolism 2017 Department of Pediatrics Best Resident Research Paper Award University of British Columbia 2017 David Alexander Clark M.D Award Department of Pediatrics- Best Resident University of British Columbia 2017 First Place in the 29th Annual National Canadian Paediatric Resident Research Competition 2017 Child & Family Research Institute Outstanding Achievement by a Resident British Columbia Children's Hospital 2016 Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) Award of Excellence 2015 Department of Paediatrics Best Resident Research Award University of British Columbia 2015 Best Resident Research Paper Award Department of Paediatrics, British Columbia Children's Hospital 2015 First place in the 27th Annual National Canadian Paediatric Resident Research Competition 2015 Gordon Cressy Student Leadership Award University of Toronto 2014 Delbert S.
