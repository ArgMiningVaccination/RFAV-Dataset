We're almost through with week two of social distancing \u2014 although that timeline is a little different for everyone \u2014 and it's safe to say it's been quite the adjustment. Naturally, we're going through a stressful period and spending an increased amount of time indoors doesn't help, but many of us are trying to make the best of it by focusing our energy on self-care. Self-care looks a little different for everyone. For some, it's following along to workout videos from their bedroom; for others, it's cooking a big homemade meal, painting their nails a different color every day, or lying in bed and binge-watching Tiger King. It's important to take some extra \"me\" time right now. Ahead, a few of our editors shared how they're keeping busy and practicing self-care with beauty from the comfort of their homes. Burning Candles Image Source: aerangis.com \"I've always fully appreciated the mood-boosting powers of candles, but I typically reserved them for special occasions or days I really need to unwind. Not the case anymore. All day, every day, I have at least four different candle scents flickering throughout my apartment \u2014 each room with a specific scent for the 'mood' I'm trying to strike. In the kitchen, it's citrusy and invigorating; the living room is floral and woodsy (currently I'm digging Aerangis Candle The Ranch ($78)); my bedroom is all about the soothing blends, like the Nest New York Cedar Leaf & Lavender Scented Candle ($42); and the bathroom is, well, I'll let you take a guess on that one.\" \u2014 Kelsey Casta\u00f1on, senior beauty editor Aerangis Candle The Ranch $78 from aerangis.com Buy Now Nest New York Cedar Leaf & Lavender Scented Candle $42 from sephora.com Buy Now Taking Baths Image Source: sephora.com \"I recently moved into a new apartment \u2014 about three weeks before social distancing started, thankfully \u2014 and gained a bath tub. With ample time at home, you better believe I've been taking full advantage of it. I feel like this new habit is the only thing helping calm my mind lately and the Lord Jones High CBD Formula Bath Salts ($65) have made the experience all the more soothing. If you need me, I can probably be found lounging in the tub, book in hand, with a candle burning in the corner.\" \u2014 Jessica Harrington, associate beauty editor Lord Jones High CBD Formula Bath Salts $65 from sephora.com Buy Now Source: ulta.com \"The second I found out I'd be working from home for an indefinite amount of time my plan of action began with one thing: self-tanner. I gave up the beauty ritual about two years ago, which at the time I was religious about, but the maintenance got to be too much and my sheets were also taking a pretty big hit from my habit. So, why start up again? The process usually takes a good amount of time to flawlessly execute: you have to exfoliate, shower, then usually, shower again to wash away a guide color. Don't even get me started on the daily maintenance on the color itself; keeping your skin sun-kissed from head to toe actually takes up a lot of your attention. Luckily, I've got plenty to give these days. Until I restock my tanning mousses and creams, I'm using the Vita Liberata pHenomenal Organic Tan Infused Cloths ($25) to brighten and bronze my skin. I'm not a tanning amateur, but they're perfect for easing back into the process since they don't require a guide color. In other words, my sheets are really happy right now and so am I.\" \u2014 Samantha Sasso, associate beauty editor, native Vita Liberata pHenomenal Organic Tan Infused Cloths Now Multi-Masking Image Source: bluemercury.com \"I never leave the house without makeup \u2014 like ever. That said, I haven't left my house in two weeks so I'm taking it as a chance to give my skin some TLC by face masking morning, mid-day, and night. Excessive? Maybe. But I officially have the glowiest skin of my life. In the mornings I use the R\u00e9Vive Masque de Radiance Brightening Moisture Mask ($150). It's a pearlescent gold color that makes me feel extra AF and leaves my skin hydrated, shimmery and radiant. Once I wash that off, I use the Summer Fridays Jet Lag Mask ($48) all day long. It's my number one, holy grail, can't live without, ride-or-die product. It gives me instant hydration and next-level dewy skin. Then, every other night, I've been layering on the Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask ($65) to clarify, detox, and amp up my glow. Try it, your skin will thank you.\" \u2014 Samantha Holender, assistant beauty editor, Makeup.com R\u00e9Vive Masque de Radiance Brightening Moisture Mask $150 from bluemercury.com Buy Now Summer Fridays Jet Lag Mask $48 from sephora.com Buy Now Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask $65 from sephora.com Buy Now Taking Longer Showers Image Source: bathandbodyworks.com \"I have a bunch of bath bombs at the ready for moments when I feel like I need to decompress and ease my nerves a bit, but when you live in a small apartment with a bathroom that you have to share with another person, baths aren't always such a peaceful experience. As an alternative, I usually turn to a few aromatherapy body washes that I got as a gift a few months ago. I like to use the Bath & Body Works Lavender Vanilla Body Wash & Foam Bath ($14) since it's a really soft fragrance that usually calms me down and helps me sleep a little better at night.\" \u2014 Danielle Jackson, assistant beauty editor Bath & Body Works Lavender Vanilla Body Wash & Foam Bath $14 from bathandbodyworks.com Buy Now Embracing An AM Beauty Routine Image Source: sephora.com \"I normally like to keep my morning beauty routine very minimal for the sake of time, but now that I don't have to rush into an office, I've had the time to upgrade my routine and indulge in an extensive line up filled with some of my favorite, most luxurious products, like the SK-II Facial Treatment Essence ($99) and Skin Regimen 1.85 HA Booster ($115). Now, I look forward to my mornings because it gives me a moment where I can completely shut off my mind and be present while doing good things for my skin. I find that it instantly changes my mood giving me the boost and positive mindset I need to take on the day.\" \u2014 Genesis Rivas, assistant beauty editor, Makeup.com SK-II Facial Treatment Essence $99 from sephora.com Buy Now Skin Regimen 1.85 HA Booster $115 from dermstore.com Buy Now Giving Nail Polish a Break Image Source: target.com \"I know like this sounds like the reverse (or at least, the oddest) act of self care, but I've finally decided to remove my toenail polish while self-isolating. Instead of keeping up with appearances, I'm letting the stained areas recuperate from years of pedicure after pedicure, and trying to heap on Tenoverten Celery Nail Oil ($27) to keep them well-hydrated. It's not your typical mood-boosting activity per se, but it's certainly the most care I've ever given my feet \u2014 at a time they really need it most.\" \u2014 KC Tenoverten Celery Nail Oil $27 from target.com Buy Now Facial Massaging Image Source: sephora.com \"I always try to look on the bright side of even the worst situations. The silver-lining of staying home and social distancing: I have more time to give myself regular facial massages. This is something I own a multitude of tools for, but rarely had time to use \u2014 until now. Lately, I've been starting my day with a gua sha facial using the Mount Lai Gua Sha Facial Lifting Tool ($28) to boost circulation, and lift and tone my face. I can instantly see the results and it gives me an excuse to spend a little extra time on me before jumping into work.\" \u2014 JH Mount Lai Gua Sha Facial Lifting Tool $28 from sephora.com Buy Now Doing At-Home Manicures Image Source: oliveandjune.com \"I am terrible at doing my own nails, which is something I've told Olive & June founder Sarah Gibson Tuttle a million times. Still, I've kept the Olive & June Everything Box ($80) kit tucked away in my closet for months. Now, with a little more time on my hands and hundreds of nail polish colors to choose from between my and my roommate's personal collections, I find myself reaching for the kit on a weekly basis. My nails and toes are now getting some extra TLC and, even if the paint jobs are kind of bleak, the hour I take out of my day to give myself a mani and pedi feels really good.\" \u2014 SS Olive & June Everything Box $80 from oliveandjune.com Buy Now Unwinding With Skin Care Image Source: amazon.com \"Most of my self-care practice has come from taking daily walks around the neighborhood. However, I've taken moments here and there to incorporate some of my rituals before social isolation, mainly my skin-care routine. I'm staying with my parents during quarantine and have been relying on my mom's (very limited) selection of skin-care products. At night I've been reaching for the La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Face Cleanser ($15). Since I haven't been wearing makeup, the cleanser gently refreshes my skin before bed. The one item I did manage to pack before escaping NYC was the Glow Recipe Watermelon Pink Juice Oil-Free Moisturizer ($39). The lightweight formula quickly absorbs and hydrates my skin without feeling like I have too much product on \u2014 perfect for humid weather here in Florida.\" \u2014 Rayna Rossitto, native social media coordinator La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Face Cleanser $15 from amazon.com Buy Now Glow Recipe Watermelon Pink Juice Oil-Free Moisturizer $39 from sephora.com Buy Now Using LED Light Therapy Image Source: dermstore.com \"In my regular day-to-day, I'm admittedly far too lazy for LED face masks and spot treatment devices, but I've really leaned in during my time at home these last few weeks. Now, any time I notice a stress breakout cropping up on my chin, I just park myself on the couch with my Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare SpotLite Acne Treatment Device ($52) in hand and watch Little Fires Everywhere like I've got all the time in the world. (Oh, wait, I actually do . . .)\" \u2014 KC Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare SpotLite Acne Treatment Device $52 from dermstore.com Buy Now Foot Masking Image Source: babyfoot.com \"There's almost never a good time to use Original Baby Foot Exfoliation Foot Peel ($25). Why? Within a week of using the exfoliating foot mask, your skin begins to shed sheaths of dead skin. It's incredibly difficult to hide when wearing open-toed mules at the office, let me tell you. I suppose that's one perk of social distancing from anyone other than my roommate: I get the chance to let me feet molt. Another bonus? Baby Foot doesn't work unless you wear the plastic booties for at least an hour, which makes my Schitt's Creek binge feel a tiny bit more productive.\" \u2014 SS Original Baby Foot Exfoliation Foot Peel $25 from babyfoot.com Buy Now Taking a Break From Makeup Image Source: shop.nordstrom.com \"Before social distancing, I wore mascara almost every day. While the washable formula I use isn't terrible for my eyelashes, they are definitely benefiting from this downtime. I haven't applied mascara in weeks and have instead been nourishing my lashes with the RevitaLash Advacned Eyelash Conditioner ($98). I'm hoping by the end of this, my lashes look longer and more luscious than ever.\" \u2014 JH RevitaLash Advacned Eyelash Extra TLC Steps Image Source: macys.com \"Like I said, I'm pretty lazy (what can I tell you? It's a curse), but having the extra time at home has given me the space to tack on a few skin-care steps I might normally skip. The first? Exfoliating my lips. In a normal week, I could barely remember to slough off the dead cells on my face, let alone this delicate area, but the Beauty by POPSUGAR Be Smooth Sugar Lip Scrub ($22) has been a real treat this last month. Not only does it come in stick form, which makes it extra easy to use, but the hydrating ingredients also help combat the drying effects my A/C unit has subjected me to with all this time inside.\" \u2014 KC Beauty by POPSUGAR Be Smooth Sugar Lip Scrub $22 from macys.com "}
