In 1854, Dr. Still, then a practicing allopathic physician in Kansas, became increasingly dissatisfied with the medical practices of his day. He developed a new theory of medicine, which he called osteopathy. He based his new approach to health care on the concepts of body unity, the body's inherent ability to heal itself given all the optimum conditions, and on the proper alignment and function of the musculoskeletal system. CUSOM takes pride in bringing the philosophies of Dr. Still to North Carolina. Over the years, the practice of medicine has evolved and so has the practice of osteopathic medicine. Today, doctors of osteopathic medicine (D.O.s) serve the public with full medical practice privileges. Osteopathic physicians are trained in all the modern practices science has to offer in medical and surgical care while incor porating the concept of treating the whole person throughout the training. Osteopathic physicians believe hands -on examination (palpation) is an essential part of making a physical diagnosis. In addition to pharmacologic treatment and surgery, manipulativ e medicine remains an important therapeutic tool utilized by osteopathic physicians in alleviating pain and treating illness. The training of osteopathic physicians has always stressed a primary care orientation. Four Tenets of Osteopathic Medicine 1. The body is a unit; the person is a unit of mind, body and spirit 2. The body is capable of self -regulation, self -healing and health maintenance 3. Structure and function are reciprocally interrelated 4. Rational treatment is based on the above three principles 1.7 Osteop athic Oath I do hereby affirm my loyalty to the profession I am about to enter. I will be mindful always of my great responsibility to preserve the health and the life of my patients, to retain their confidence and respect both as a physician and a fr iend who will guard their secrets with scrupulous honor and fidelity, to perform faithfully my professional duties, to employ only those recognized methods of treatment consistent with good judgment and with my skill and ability, keeping in mind a lways nature's laws and the body's inherent capac ity for recovery . I will be ever vigilant in aiding in the general welfare of the community, sustaining its laws and institutions, not engaging in those practices, which will in any way, bring shame or discredit upon my profession or myself . I will give no drugs for deadly purposes to any person, though it be asked of me . I will endeavor to work in accord with my colleagues in a spirit of progressive cooperation and never by word or by act cast imputat ions upon them or t heir rightfu l pract ices. I will look with respect and esteem upon all those who have taught me my art. To my college I will be loyal and str ive always for its best interests and for the interests of the students who will come after me. I will be ever aler t to further the app lication of basic b iologic truths to the hea ling arts and to deve lop the pr inciples of osteopathy, which were f irst enunc iated by Andrew Tay lor St ill. 15 2. Admission to the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine Program 2.1 Admissions Process The Office of Admissions ensures that qualified student s are selected for matriculation to the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine Program at Campbell University. CUSOM is committed to selecting applicants who w ill be an a sset to the profession of osteopathic medicine. The goals of the admissions process are to: Understand each app licant as a whole person.

Health insurance is available through the University. An insurance waiver for existing comparable insurance is coordinated through the office of International Admissions. Student Services The Campbell University Office of Inte rnational Affairs serves international students on campus. It shares responsibility for processing all international acceptances and serves as liaison between the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and all international students on campus. 21 2.13 Technic al Standards for Admission to CUSOM The requirements to succeed at CUSOM will be those necessary to successfully complete the curriculum and to practice osteopathic medicine with full practice rights. Students must be able to function in a variety of lear ning and clinical settings , and to quickly, accurately, and consi stently learn and process data Osteopathic physicians utilize touching as part of the osteopathic approach to treatment. As part of the educational process, CUSOM students must be able to to lerate being touched and to touch others in order to acquire the skills necessary for palpation and examination. This palpation is performed in a professional and appropriate manner. Additionally, CUSOM utilizes cadavers as part of anatomy laboratories. As such, CUSOM students must be able to tolerate working with and touching cadavers. CUSOM students also participate in ultrasound labs and, as such, may be required to perform ultrasound procedures on each other. Acquiring the skills to palpate and exam ine patients requires a student to examine disrobed patients of both genders and is mandatory to successful completion of the curriculum at CUSOM. In physical diagnosis and osteopathic manipulative medicine laboratory experiences, as well as other clinica l laboratories where skill s are acquired, students are required to participate in the examination of fellow students of both genders who may be partially disrobe d. Students need to wear attire such as shorts and partially disrobe for certain laboratory experiences. These are requirements for all students, regardless of cultural beliefs, in order for the student to acquire the skills necessary to practice medicine. Students who have any concern should discuss them with the Executive Director for Student Af fairs prior to applying CUSOM will make reasonable accommodations for students whose handicaps allow them to accomplish a successful career as an osteopathic physician. Students, however, are required to function with independence and perform at all skill levels described below which CUSOM holds as mandatory for the safe and effective pr actice of osteopathic medicine. CUSOM is also committed to patient safety and assuring a safe and effective environment that does not place patients, students, or others a t risk. Each technical standard has been chosen from standards osteopathic physicians deem necessary for the safe and effective practice of osteopathic medicine. Applicants who do not meet the above technical stand ards should not apply to CUSOM. Applican ts must possess the abilities and skil ls in the following five areas: 1. Observation The student must be able to visually observe laboratory demonstrations, microscopic tissue with the aid of the microscope, and computer based pictures used in laboratory demonstrations. The student must be able to visually and accurately observe physical signs and symptoms of a patient used in diagnosis and management. The use of a trained intermediary in such cases would compromise performance, as it would be mediated by another individual's power of selection, observation, and experience. Observation requires the functional use of vision and somatic sensations and is enhanced by the sense of smell. 2. Communication 22 The student must be able to communicate effectively in English as the curriculum and clinical experiences are offered in English. Students are encouraged to learn other languages for medical communication; however, all curriculum and assessment are given in English. CUSOM requires the functional ability to s peak, hear, and observe patients in order to elicit accurate medical information. The student must be able both to describe changes in mood, activity, posture, and other physical characteristics and to perceive nonverbal communication. The student must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in verbal and written form. The student must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently with the patient and with all members of the health care team in order to successfully complete the curriculu m. 3. Motor Students must have sufficient motor function to elicit information from patients by palpation, percussion, and other diagnostic measures. The student must have sufficient motor function to carry out maneuvers of general and emergency care and of osteopathic manipulation. Examples of emergent motor functions are cardiopulmonary resuscitation, administration of intravenous fluids and intravenous medications, management of an obstructed airway, hemorrhage control, closure by suturing of wounds, a nd obstetrical deliveries. In addition, the delivery of osteopathic manipulation requires the use of extremities in palpation, positioning, and carrying out maneuvers of manipulation. These actions require fine and gross motor and sensory function, as we ll as the senses of touch and adequate vision for inspection. 4. Intellectual Students must have the ability to reason, calculate, analyze, measure, and synthesize information. The student must be able to comprehend, memorize, synthesize, and recall a l arge amount of information without assistance, to successfully complete the curriculum. The student must be able to comprehend three -dimensional relationships and to understand spatial relationships to succeed in school and to administer medical care. The student must be able to gain knowledge through all types of learning materials that the CUSOM curriculum offers and must be able to perform pattern identification, memorization, recall information, and to identify and discriminate important information, to problem solve, and to calculate and make decisions in timed situations and in the presence of noise and distraction. The above intellectual abilities are necessary, as students and graduates will be expected and required to perform pattern identificati on, immediate recall of memorized material, identification, and discrimination to elicit important information, problem solving, and decision- making as to emergent diagnosis and treatment of patients. Students must be able to recall important information for diagnosis and to calculate therapeutic management of emergent conditions. This type of demonstrated intellectual ability must be performed in a rapid and time - efficient manner so as not to place patients in emergent conditions at risk. It is common for emergent situations to occur in the presence of visually distracting and noisy environments. Such emergent situations include, but are not limited to, cardiopulmonary compromise, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, obstetrical and neonatal emergencies, tra uma presentations, poisonings and toxic exposures, shock, and hemorrhage. 5. Behavioral and Social Attributes The student must have the emotional health needed for full use of his/her intellectual capabilities at all times. The emotional health required f or effective communication and for professional, mature, sensitive, and compassionate patient/physician or patient/student relationships must be present. Students must be able to function effectively under stress and with physically taxing workloads. Stu dents must have the emotional health to be able to function without the aid of medications that are known to e ffect intellectual abilities and judgment. The student must have the emotional stability and motivation to deliver patient care and to make emerg ent decisions at al l times. 23 The ability to adapt to changing environments and stressful situations and to display compassion and integrity, while maintaining the necessary intellectual capacity to care for patients is one that is observed during the interv iew process and throughout the progress in medical school. An ability to demonstrate the emotional health necessary for the delivery of quality and safe medical care is mandatory throughout medical school. CUSOM considers drug and alcohol addiction or abuse as a risk factor for unsa fe care. If an applicant has a question as to his/her ability to meet the minimal technical standards listed, the applicant is required to notify the Office of Admissions in advance of applying so that reasonable testing may oc cur. Applicants must identify to the Office of Admissions, all areas where there is question in meeting these technical standards. 2.14 Americans with Disabilities Act CUSOM is operating in compliance with the timeline established by the Americans with Di sabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), and the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, both as amended, to assure that its facilities, programs and student policies are accessible to individuals with disabilities. Students and app licants w ith spec ific needs shou ld contact the CUSOM Office of Student Services. The University's ADA Coordinator is Robert C.

Prior to convening the grievance hearing meeting, the Grievance Hearing Board shall be trained on the specific grievance hearing procedures relating to the individual grievance and will be provided with additional educational material as appropri ate. Following this initi al hearing and presentation, if additiona l information is n eeded to render a decision, the Grievance Hearing Board may recess for a period of not greater than two weeks. The Grievance Hearing B oard, or the Executive Director for Student Affairs at the request of the Grievance Hearing Board, sha ll condu ct further investigation of the alleged grievances. The Grievance Hearing B oard may during this time meet with the CUSOM's legal counsel who ha s further expertise in the law regarding disability and dis crimination. The second m eeting of the Grievance Hearing B oard, whi ch shall occur within a two-week period, sh all be to further discuss the grievance, the investigation, the educational materials provided, and the legal couns el advice. The Grievance Hearing Board may require second int erviews with the person filing the grievance or with those whom the grievance is filed against. The Grievance Hearing Board shall make a final ruling at this m eeting. Minut es will be taken of all Grievance Hearing Board meetings. The Grievance Hearing Board shall send a letter to the student within 14 calendar days of the final determination. Step Three: Final Appeal Procedure The student ha s the right to appeal the decision of the Grievance Hearing Board to the Dean of CUSOM. The student ha s 30 da ys after receivi ng the Grievance Hearing Board decision letter to file for an appeal. All su ch requests must be in writing, signed by the student, and be sent via certified mail. The Dean sha ll have a period o f not greater than two w eeks to re spond to the appeal. The Dean sh all have the final determination as to the outcome. Any unresolved complaint may be appealed in writing to the CUSOM Dean, whose decision will be final. Student commentary, whether complime ntary or a complaint in nature, will be directed back to the appropriate department within CUSOM. Each area will be charged with r eviewing the relevant information and making necessary changes as appropriate. The purpose of providing feedback will be to ensure improvement. Non-Compli ance with the AOA Accreditation standards .

The service performed by members of student organizations benefits not only the community and the region, but also the members, as they gain valuable knowledge, skills, and experience. Many CUSOM students will be actively involved in at least one organization, and some students may be members of several. CUSOM's students also may serve as officers or committee members at the state, regional or national level. The goals of stude nt clubs and organizations relate to the mission of CUSOM and the osteopathic profession. As such, the following are the endorsed student clubs and organizations at CUSOM: 42 Emergency Medicine Club Family Medicine Club (ACOFP and AAFP) Christian Medical and Dental Association (CMDA) Internal Medicine Club (ACOI and ACP ) Pediatrics Club Psychiatry Club Obstetrics and Gynecology Club Sports Medicine Club Student Advocate Association (SAA) Student Association of Military Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons (SAMOPS) Student Government Association (SGA) Student National Medical Association (SNMA) Student Osteopathic Medical Association ( SOMA) Surgery Club Student Osteopathic Surgical Association (SOSA) Student American Association of Osteopathy (SAAO) Medical Missions Club Grade Requirement s Students must h ave at least an overall 3.0 g rade point average, no c ourse failures, and be passing a ll currently enrolled courses to: Serve as an officer in SGA Serve as an officer of a CUSOM c lub or organization Serve on a CUSOM c ommittee Attend any off-campus c onferen ce/m eeting CUS OM Student Government The Student Government is the official voice for all students.

The responsibilities of S tudent Government include: collecting and expressing student opinion acting as a liaison for the student body, promoting osteopathic medicine, supporting club and class activities and working to improve the quality of life for all students at CUSOM. The O ffice of Student Affairs serves as the liaison between the administration and Student Government . Recogn ition of Student Organ izations The first step in obtaining recognition for a new student organization is the subm ission of a petition to the Office of Student Affairs. The petition m ust include the goals of the organization, the proposed charter, the na me of the faculty advisor, a list of club officers and a list of charter members. Once the pe tition ha s been approved by the Executive Director of Student Affairs, the petition is forwarded to the Dean for final approval. The approved status of an or ganization is valid for one year, renewable on an annual basis. 43 Use of College Logo Student clubs or organizations reque sting the use of the CUSOM logo for correspondenc e or other purposes must have appr oval from the Executive Director of Student Affairs.

Student Sponso red E vent Any event conduc ted by a student club or organization recognized by CUSOM is considered a student-spons ored event. Events of this nature require the approval of the Office of Student Affairs and requests must be subm itted in writing to the O ffice of Student Affairs. Requests should include a statement of purpose and the facilities required for the event. Event scheduling forms requiring the use of institutional facilities are available through the Office of S tudent Affairs. Alcoho lic beverages are p rohibited at any CU SOM sponsor ed student club or orga nization off-campus event or activity. Schedu ling E xtracurricular Activities Students or student organizations wishing to hos t events involving extracurricular academ ic activities, i.e., speak ers, mini-courses, p harmaceutical exhibits, or non-credit courses, m ust have the approval of the Office of Student Affairs.

The Dean w ill determine what co nferences students may attend. National Me etings will be excluded from this conference po licy. For example, a me mber of the Student Government Associat ion m ay be required to attend conferences more than twice a year but still need to follow t he excused abse nce po licy. Only students in good a cademic standing will be considered as eligible. Copies of the Student Organiz ations Handbook can be obtained from the Office of Student Affairs . 4.18 Student Parking The Department of Campus Safety is responsible for assigning lots on campus, collecting fee/fines and enforcement of parking regulations. Students should not park in areas designated as Faculty/Staff Parking on the brick sid ewalks or othe r areas not condu cive to the aesthetics of Campbell Univ ersity for the purpose of loading and unloa ding is prohibit ed unl ess it is d eemed necessary and approved by the Executiv e Direc tor of Student Affairs. 44 Addition al information on CU Parking Policy can be found at http://www. campbell.edu/life /parking/ Any violations of the parking policy may result in disciplinary action. 4.19 Student Lockers Lockers are assigned to all first and second y ear studen ts. Loc ker assignments are made at the be ginning of each academic year. All lockers must be cleaned o ut by the last day of classes for each academic year. At the end of the academ ic year all student s will be asked to remove the locks and empty the lockers for the summer. 4.20 Student Conduct All CUSOM students are expec ted to con duct themselves in a professional and ethical manner at all times. Establishing and m aintaining the highest concepts of honor and pe rsonal integrity during medical schoo l training is critical to the training of physicians. It is the respons ibility of the student to support the standards and i t is reasonable to expe ct this of all students attending CUSOM. Respec t for Patients Take the utmost care to ens ure patient respect and confidentiality. As osteopathic medical students, students need to demonstrate respect for patients through appropriate language and be havior, including that which is non- threatening and non-judgmental. Patient privacy and modesty shou ld be respected as much as possible during history taking, phy sical examinations, and any other contact, to maintain professional relationships with the patients and their families. It is important for students to be truthful and not intentionally mislead or give false information. Studen ts should avoid disclosing information to a patient that only the patient's phy sician should reveal. Student s should always consult more experienced m embers of the medical team r egarding patient care, or at the request of the patient. Respec t for Faculty, Staff, Colleagues, Hospital Personne l, and C ommunity Students will respect faculty, staff, colleagues, and others, including hosp ital personnel, guests, and m embers of the general public. This respect should be demonstrated by punc tuality in relationships with patients and pee rs, prompt execu tion of reasonable instructions, and deference to those with superior knowledge, expe rience or capabilities. Students shou ld express views in a calm and r espectful manner when in disagreement with another individual, und erstanding that a mutual agreement will not always be reached. Respec t for Self All students should uphold a high level of personal ethics, beliefs, and m orals in their daily conduc t. Respec t for Laws, Policies and R egulations Students need to respect the laws, policies, and regulations at all levels of the University and the local co mmunity. Student Statement of Professional Ethics As a CUSOM student , I will... Be gui ded by a deep conviction of the worth and dignity of all human life; 45 Pursue the advancement of knowledge and recognize the special responsibilities placed upon me; Adhere to the policies and procedures of CUSOM in all matters; Seek and communicate truth; Promote scholarly competence and integrity; Practice intellectual honesty; Uphold scholarly and ethical standard s; Demonstrate respect for peers, faculty, staff, administration and the community in general; Foster honest academic conduct and ensure student evaluations reflect the student's true merit; Promote appropriate interaction between students and faculty, students and administration, and students and staff; Avoid any exploitation, harassment, or discriminatory treatment; Respect and defend the free in quiry of associates' exchange of ideas and show respect for the opinions of others; Give due regard to the paramount responsibilities within the institution in determining the amount and character of work done outside it. All CUSOM student s have the right s and obligations of other citizens and measure the urgency of these obligations in the light of responsibilities to colleagues, to their profession, and to the institution. When CUSOM student s speak or act as private persons, they avoid creating the impr ession of speaking or acting for their School or the University. As citizens engaged in a profession that depends upon freedom for it s health and integrity, student s have a particular obligation to promote conditions of free inquiry and to further public understanding of academic freedom. 4.21 Accommodations Policy Students requesting accommodations or special services from CUSOM because of learning disabilities are required to submit documentation in writing to determine eligibility for the accommodations and services in accordance with Section 504 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). A diagnosis of a learning disability does not necessarily qualify a student for academic accommodations under the law. To establish a student is covered under sec tion 504 of the ADA, the documentation must include the disability substantially limits some major lif e activity, including learning. All students who seek an accommodation must submit documentation in writing to verify the existence of a disability. The documents serve to determine eligibility for accommodation (s) and the type of accommodations (s) CUSOM can reasonably provide. The student will be asked to complete and sign a Release of Information Form. This form will allow the Executive Director of S tudent Affairs to discuss the accommodations requested by the student with the appropriate members of CUSOM administration The following guidelines are provided in the interest of assuring documentation of a learning disability is complete and supports the students request for accommodations. CUSOM will determine eligibility and appropriate services, case by case, based on the quality and completeness of the documentation submitted. Documentation must be less than one year old and must be provided by an a ppropriately credentialed healthcare professional. CUSOM reserves the right to verify any written documentation. The following requirements provide students, schools, and professional diagnosticians with a common understanding of the components of docume ntation that are necessary to validate the existence of a learning disability, the impact on the individual's 46 educational performance, and the need for academic accommodations for the purp ose of the ADA and Section 504. Learning Disability Documentation Re quirements Qualified Person Must Conduct the Evaluation A trained, qualified, and licensed professional (e.g., psychologist or psychiatrist) who has direct experience with adolescents and adults with learning disabilities must administer the assessment . Documentation must be current Reasonable accommodations are based on the current impact of the disability on academic performance. In most cases this means that a diagnostic evaluation should be age appropriate and relevant to the students learning environment, and show the students' current level of functioning. If documentation does not address the individual 's current level of functioning, a re -evaluation may be required. Medical students must submit their evaluation and supporting documentations thirty days prior to matriculation. Documentation Must Include Specific Diagnosis The report must include a clear and direct statement that a learning disability does or does not exist, including a rule out of alternative explanations of learning problems. Term s such as \"learning difficulty\", \"appears\", \"suggests\" or \"probable\" do not support a conclusive diagnosis. Documentation Must Be Comprehensive The documentation must include a summary containing relevant historical information, instructional interventions , related services and age of initial diagnosis. The documentation must also include objective data regarding aptitude, achievement and information processing. Test scores (standard scores, percentiles, and grade equivalents) must also be included in the d ocumentation. Recommendation for Accommodations A diagnostic report may include specific recommendations for accommodation(s). A prior history of an accommodation, without a demonstration of a current need, does not in and of itself warrant the provision of that accommodation. Each accommodation recommended by an evaluator should include a rationale. The evaluation should support the recommendations with specific test results or clinical observations. If an accommodation is not clearly identified in the dia gnostic report, CUSOM will seek clarification and/or additional information either from the student's evaluator or from another trained professional chosen by CUSOM. CUSOM will make the final decision as to whether appropriate and reasonable accommodations are warranted and can be provided. CUSOM reserves the right to request reassessment of the student's disability when questions arise regarding previous assessment or provision of services or accommodations or when the student requests additional services or accommodations above and beyond what has been prev iously provided to the student. Process for Receiving Reasonable A ccommodations 47 All documentation related to the students disability and accommodations shall be maintained by the Executive Director of S tudent Affairs in a secure location. Student Affairs must receive all requests including supporting documents no later than July 1st of the year of matriculation. Upon receipt of the documentation, the Executive Director of Student Affairs will meet with the Dean, Director of Behavioral Health and the Senior A ssociate Dean for Academic Affairs to determine what reasonable accommodations can be given or whether to deny the request. The student will then be contacted to discuss and arrange for the accommodation should it be granted. Additionally a letter will be given t o student advising the student of the outcome of the meeting. If a problem arises concerning reasonable accommodation, the student should contact the Executive Director of Student Affairs. 5. Academic Information and Policies 5.1 Academic Advising , Counseling, and Administrator/ Faculty Access Students are assigned a faculty advisor upon matriculation. The advisor/advisee relationship will provide consistent feedback regarding academic perfo rmance and direct the student to additional resources within the institution. Basic science and clinical faculty are involved in student advisement. This relationship endeavors to create an atmosphere of trust and meaningful dialogue. Significant person al or mental health problems will be referred to the Director of Behavioral Health for potential referral for counseling and assessment. The academic advisor -advisee relationship provides mentoring between faculty and students on both academic and persona l levels. Students are required to meet with their faculty advisor at least twice per semester. Students on probation will meet with faculty advisors at least twice a month or more frequently as required by the Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standa rds Committee (APPS). In addition to their role as student advisors, faculty also meet with students to provide additional help with course work. Students are encouraged to schedule meetings with faculty advisors when necessary. Faculty will publish office hours for students during specific courses and be available to students for additional assistance. Scheduling will be either directly with faculty or through the appropriate administrative assistant. Executive Director of Student Affairs assigns facult y advisors to each student. The advisor will provide guidance while students are attending the school. The faculty advisor, the Dean, and the staff are available to discuss personal and academic problems that may arise and provide guidance and/or referr als to other resources as necessary. Additionally, students will be assigned an individual faculty advisor and a clinical advisor for years 3 and 4. CUSOM is a student -centered institution. As such, all administrators will be accessible to students whe n needed and based on availability. Additionally, administrators will strive to have informa l meetings on a regular ba sis, such as \"Students Breakfast with a Dean\", a week ly meeting of small student groups with the academic deans. 5.2 Attendance Attenda nce Policy Attendance is required during the first and second years at all lectures, labs, and other scheduled curricular activities. Attendance is monitored using electronic verification. Absences for illness or emergencies will be considered appropriat ely. Any falsification of attendance will be viewed as an Honor Code violation and dealt with accordingly. 48 Failure to maintain adequate attendance during the first two years of the curriculum will result in corrective action through the Office of Academi c Affairs. Third - and fourth- year students are required to attend to the requisite clinical duties of the particular rotation on a daily basis with structured time away from the rotation at the discretion of the clinical site director. Absences from clin ical duties due to illness or emergency are limited to 2 days / month before work will need to be made up. In the above cases, a student may be permitted to make up work missed. It is the student's responsibility, whenever possible, to notify CUSOM offic ials in advance that he/she will be absent. As professionals, students are expected to strictly adhere to the attendance policy. Attendance is required at all scheduled instructional periods and will be taken regularly. Unexcused absences will be consid ered violations of CUSOM policy and may result in disciplinary action by the Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standards (APPS) Committee including, but not limited to, loss of remedial privileges, removal from any leadership position with any student c lub, organization or student government office, and possible notation in the Dean's Letter of Evaluation. In extreme cases, absenteeism or tardiness may result in dismissal. Excused absences for illness or requests for a personal leave may be granted by t he appropriate D ean or clinical campus directors or Regional Deans. It is recognized that there may be isolated instances when an individual must be absent; however; the student who misses a lecture, laboratory, workshop, or rotation is not excused from the subject materials or duties of that particular period. The student may be required to make -up the missed educational session(s) during off -hours. No makeup laboratories will be conducted. Students on rotations must satisfy any other requirements as o utlined in the Clinical Clerkship Manual. For an absence to be considered excused for medical reasons, notice must be received by CUSOM prior to the missed class or activity, and a note must be submitted from the primary care physician upon the student's r eturn to class if medical condition/illness is three days or greater. Students in third - and fourth- year rotations must abide by the additional requirements contained in the CUSOM Clinical Rotation Manual. Students may receive excused absences to attend C USOM -related activities or national meetings of student clubs and organizations. No absences will be excused without approval from the appropriate dean. Any request for an excused absence must be submitted, in writing, to the appropriate dean at least 10 days pri or to the anticipated absence. Excused absences may be fo r qualifying reasons including: Medical necessity: illness of the student or member of the immediate family. In order for an absence of three days or greater to be considered excused for m edical reasons, a note must be submitted from the examining physician upon the student's return to class. Minor illnesses/conditions less than three days, such as upper respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, minor accidents, may not need to be documente d by a physician's excuse; however, notification of absence is still required. Death in family: death of immediate family member, significant other, or close relative. Documentation may be required. Special circumstances/other: circumstances outside of the above situations (vehicle accidents, medical emergencies, etc.) Appropriate proof or documentation will be required. Attendance at certain CUSOM- related activities such as conferences. In the event of an excused absence from an examination, written pe rmission to take a makeup examination must be obtained first from the professor and the appropriate D ean. It is essential that each student make every effort not to miss any examination. Requests for make -up exams or quizzes must be made in a timely manner. An unexcused absence from an examination, quiz, laboratory, or assignment may result in a grade of zero. 49 In cases of unplanned absence or lateness, the student must notify the Executive Director of Student Affairs as soon as possible prior to the mis sed class/activity. In addition, if the student will miss an exam, it is the student's responsibility to notify the Director of Medical Education and professor via phone and email when it is first noted that an absence will be necessary. The CUSOM Office of Student Affairs can be contacted at 910- 893-1770. For unplanned absences to be considered excused, students must obtain an \"Excused Absence Student Request Form \" from the Office of Student Affairs. Students should do this in person and are responsible for obtaining any make -up materials within 3 school days. Students must be in good standing in order to be granted an excused absence for CUSOM -related activities. The Office of Medical Education should verify that the student is in good academic standing and sign the form prior to any other signatures being obtained. No travel arrangements should be made prior to approval being granted. Students on clinical rotations may also request time -off to attend student organizational meetings, seminars, or any extra -curricular activity. The clinical preceptor, Regional Dean/Director of Medical Education, and the Associate Dean for Clinical Education must grant approval . They must be in good academic standing with a minimum grade point average of 3.0 and have no failures on clinical rotations. No travel arrangements should be made prior to approval being granted. Promptness is another trait professional health care practitioners must display. Additionally, tardiness in class both disturbs the professor and the entire student body and is thus markedly inconsiderate and rude. Repeated violations will be considered improper professional behavior and may result in disciplinary action and notation in the Dean's Letter of Evaluation. Please refer to the appropriate CUSOM policies. Official Holidays CUSOM obse rves standard University holidays. The following days are currently observed. New Year Easter Friday Memorial Day Independence Day Labor Day Thanksgiving Christmas Holida ys falling on the weekend w ill be observed either on the Friday before the holiday or the Monday after the holiday. Jury Duty It is the duty of every citizen to serve on jury duty when called.

Repeat ed episodes may result in the problem being viewed as an issue to be addressed with the Academic Performance, P romotion, a nd Standards (APPS) C ommittee. Additional Dress Code Requirements: Certain educational experie nces at CUSOM require specific dress code. These include the laboratory classes of OMM, Anatomy, and Clinical Skill. OMM Laboratory Dress Code (adapted from nationally accepted standards) The dress requirement in the clinical skills training sessions is d esigned to promote learning by providing optimal access to diagnostic observ ation and palpatory experience. Wearing inappropriate clothing interferes with a partner's experience of diagnosis and treatment. Appropriate attire must be cl ean and includes: Shorts which are several inches above the knee (mid -thigh) . - No jean shorts, cut -offs, thick- seamed shorts, spandex, shor t shorts or knee length shorts.

Sports bras or bathing suit tops for women. - These should expose the spine and ribs (not wide T -back styles). Student Doctors may wear scrubs (or other apparel approved by the Course Direc tor) over laboratory attire when not in the role of the patient. 51 Remove shoes when you are the patient (no shoes are permitted on the tables). Hats or head coverings (other than for religious purposes) are not permitted in OMM lab. Religious head coverin gs will need to be removed when they would obscure the immediate area to be examined or treated (e.g., head, neck, and upper back). They may be immediately replaced after this portion of clinical skills training. Anatomy Laboratory Dress Code Lab coats ar e to be worn in the anatomy lab at all times. Students must wear appropriate footwear that meets the needs of the environments. No flip -flops or open toed shoes are all owed in the anatomy laboratory. 5.4 Global Assessment Throughout the medical curricul um, examinations and other assessments are administered to assess student knowledge and performance. Students are assessed to gauge satisfactory individual academic progress on the basis of performance on written and practical examinations, Objective Stru ctured Clinical Examinations in the clinical setting, and performance on national osteopathic board examinations. The Director of Assessment, Planning and Accreditation, as well as the Office of Academic Affairs, work collaboratively to determine individu al student's eligibility for promotion or graduation, consider the results of the student assessments and reports concerning attendance, and monitor conduct and potential professionalism issues. Students who fail to make satisfactory academic progress thro ugh the curriculum may be remediated. Under certain circumstances, students may be brought before the Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standards Committee (APPS) Committee for disciplinary action. 5.5 Course Credit Hours, Grading , and GPAs Keeping w ith the definition of a credit hour as provided in the glossary of the Accreditation of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine: COM Accreditation Standards and Procedures, Campbell University defines a credit hour based on the regulation of the U.S. Secretary of Education at 34 CFR 600.2- Except as provided in 34 CFR 668.8(k) and (l), as the amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably ap proximates not less than: One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out of class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or ten to twelve weeks for one qua rter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including labor atory work, internships, practical, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours. CUSOM Block Credit Calculation Policy CUSOM awards Block credit values to course offerings based on delivery method and duration utilizing stan dards endorsed by the American Association of Collegiate Registrar's and Admission Officers (AACRAO), as well as the minimum Federal Financial Aid regulations. 52 CUSOM defines the academic hour as 50 minutes of instruction time, and the Block credit calculat ions as approximately 15 academic hours (lecture/labs/s mall groups/other) = 1.0 credit. The actual number of contact hours per credit is delineated in the table below. The CUSOM Curriculum Committee reviews this policy periodically . The credit hour calc ulation process described above is consistent with US Department of Education standards; however, considering the unique nature of medical education, it is useful to report credit hours as a confined range of contact hours, a method used by other accredite d medical schools. As such, CUSOM uses the following designations for credit hours: CUSOM has developed and publicized a system, in keeping with the CUSOM mission and objectives, to assess the progre ss of each student toward acquiring the competencies essential to effective performance as an osteopathic physician. Throughout all four years students must complete all require d course work and clinical rotations with passing grades as published in the A cademic Bulletin. Students who fail any part of the curriculum may be offered remediation. Under certain circumstances, students may be brought before the APPS Comm ittee for disciplinary action. Additionally, CUSOM maintains longitudinal records marking th e career tracks, choices, and achievements of graduates in a comprehensive assessment system. This assessment includes: COMLEX -USA Level 1 and COMLEX -USA rates; licensure; geographic area and toral program; and AOA or ABMS board certification. CUSOM publishes outcomes of student performance in annual reports to the faculty and Board of Trustees. CUSOM has adopted the following schema for determining letter grades and clinical grades: Grading S cale MS-1 and MS -2 QP MS-3 and MS -4a Traditional Rotation Grades QPb Other Grades A 90-100c 4.0 H Honors 4.0 I Incomplete B 80-89 3.0 HP High Pass 3.0 IP In Progress Contact Hours Credits Contact Hours Credits 01 - 10 0.5 80 - 87 5.5 11 - 20 1.0 88 - 94 6.0 21 - 27 1.5 95 - 100 6.5 28 - 36 2.0 101 - 105 7.0 37 - 42 2.5 106 - 113 7.5 43 - 48 3.0 114 - 120 8.0 49 - 54 3.5 121 - 131 8.5 55 - 64 4.0 132 - 140 9.0 65 - 74 4.5 141 - 150 9.5 75 - 79 5.0 151 - 162 10.0 53 C 70-79 2.0 PC Pass Clinical 2.0 WM Withdrew -Medical F <70 0.0 FC Fail Clinical P 4.0 WF Withdrew 4.0 QP, F = 0.0 QP Remediated P = 2.0 QP PC and FC = Pass Clinical and Fail Clinical, respectively aBoth traditional grades and clinical modules/exam grades are assigned in MS -3 and MS -4. bQP = Quality Points: points assigned to grades in an academic \"banking\" system. Under CUSOM's grading system, an A is worth 4 QP/hour, a B is 3 QP/hour, a C is 2 QP/hour, and no points for F or failing grades. A student who earns an A in a 3-hour course has 3 hours X 4 QP/hour = 12 total points cThe maximum percentage cannot exceed 100. Percentage grades are rounded to the tenth from 0.50 upwards, therefore 82.50 -82.99 = 83 while 82.01 - 82.49 = 82. NOTE : Successfully remediated courses are designated as C* or a P*. The * differentiates between the students who pass during the normal block or rotation with a C or P. The grade point average (GPA) is the sum of earned grade points divided by the sum of Block- hour credits passed and fail ed. Students may be required to remediate all courses within a Block where the student's grade falls below 70. Students are required to remediate or complete a curriculum where the student's grade falls in I (Incomplet e) or IP (In Progress) status. Stude nts who do not successfully complete or remediate these courses are awarded an F or failing grade. A student will receive a grade of C for a remediated course. Exceptions may be granted to students repeating an entire academic year. For the first two yea rs, most courses have a traditional letter grade (A, B, C, and F) and are calculated i nto the GPA. For the third and fourth years, all rotations have a clinical rotation grade and all core rotations have clinical modules/exam grade. The clinical rotation grade and the module exam grade use the Honors , High Pass, Pass, Fail system. Students must pass both the \"educational module\" and \"rotation\" portions of the course. All rotations on which a student receives a failing rotation grade must be repeated. The grade earned on the repeated clinical rotation will be recorded on the transcript. Students failing a module or post -rotation exam have a second opportunity to pass the exam within 30 days of notification. If the student fails the second attempt at the post -rotation exam, an F is recorded on the module/exam grade, and the rotation must be repeated. Students who fail one or more rotations or more than one post-rotation exam will be reviewed and acted upon by the APPS Committee . No grade will be changed unless the Office of Academic Affairs or the Office of Clinical Affairs certifies to the Registrar, in writing, that an error occurred or that the remediation results in a grade change. A student may appeal to the Dean for consideration only af ter the APPS Committee has met. 54 Assessment of performance compared to national cohorts is through the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Exam ination- USA Levels 1, 2 and 3. 5.6 Grading Assessment Outcome objectives have been mapped to the courses in which they will be covered, and evaluation strategies will be used to ensure that all graduates achieve the intended learning outcomes. A comprehensive assessment plan summarizes additional methods and metrics that will be tracked for continual program evaluation an d improvement. Assessment of knowledge is by multiple -choice examinations and quizzes administered electronically at scheduled and random intervals. Laboratory and clinical skills assessments are in written and/or verbal format. Assessment of performance on clinical rotations is by end- of-rotation exa minations and related methods. Grading For Years One and Two Evaluation Categories For the purposes of this Grading Policy, CUSOM recognizes four categories of educational effort, with the maximum percentage of the final course grade allowed by each category as delineated below: i. Integrated examinations, typically multiple choice questions (MCQs): 90% ii. Laborator y practical examinations: 50% iii. Quizzes: (ARS or Blackboard quizzes only) 30% iv. Other (e.g., SIM performance, Early Clinical Experiences, Projects): 70% The total for a course must equal 100% and can be comprised of any combination of the above designated components as determined by the faculty member with approval from the respective Associate Dean. Each category is represente d within the CUSOM curriculum. Process In an effort to promote faculty flexibility in assigning grades through assessment venues for the four categories identified previously, yet also provide consistency across courses, CU SOM recognizes the following approach to testing and grading: Integrated exams occur every three weeks in each Block in years 1 and 2. FMP and PCC course questions are not included on the integrated exams except where they are consistent with discipline co ntent in other courses. All other courses, including OMM and Clinical Skills, may have questions on integrated exams. Each course offered within a Block is required to have at least one quiz during the Block. Quizzes also are administered each Friday morn ing in the Case Presentation sessions of the curriculum. These will be a maximum of 10 questions, and interdisciplinary when possible Quizzes may be administered at other times as determined by respective faculty; however, the total percentage value of qu izzes towards the total grade must not exceed the maximum identified above. Quizzes can only be administered by using the Audience Response System (ARS) or through Blackboard quizzes. Laboratory practical exams typically are separate from integrated exams; however, often content may be similar on both. 55 Course grades are determined based on total points and the percentage of total points earned. Each Course Director, in consultation with other faculty, propose to the Dean's Council a grading plan for her/h is course. This must be submitted no later than one month prior to the start of the course. The Dean's Council reviews each submitted grading proposal to ensure it is consistent with the CUSOM Grading Policy. The Course Director, in turn, is advised if t he proposed grading plan is appropriate, or if changes need to be made. Grades are defined by the course -grading plan approved prior to start of the course. As such, bonus points are not permitted. In rare instances, there may be exceptions to the establi shed Grading Policy, which require justification for deviation from the original plan; however, every attempt is made to ensure the policy stated to the students at the start of the course is the policy by which they will receive their course grades. The Dean authorizes any exception to the Grading Policy upon recommendation from the Dean's Council. Grading for Years Three and Four Educational modules : Lectures, cases, and other forms of delivery are used in the third and fourth year curriculum. Post-rotation exams: Each student, for co re rotations, is required to pass a post -rotation exam to assure that the expected medical knowledge has been acquired. In addition to the experiences received in the clinical training sites, students are expected to read i n the assigned text and complete all curricular assignments to prepare for these exams. Objective Structured Clinical Performance Examinations (OSCE) and Standardized Patients (SPs): OSCEs and standardized patient exercises demonstrate the student's abilit y to perform clinical skills and to evaluate patient presentations for the most common disorders found in adult and pediatric patients. SP exercises or OSCE's will be done at the end of each block. Multi -station OSCEs will be given at end of first, second, and third years. These include taking a medical history, performing a physical examination, evaluating signs and symptoms to formulate a differential diagnosis, performing or assessing the results of diagnostic exams to evaluate and narrow a differential diagnosis, and common early management scenarios. Clinical Rotation Evaluation : Competency- based rating forms are used by preceptors to evaluate each student's clinical skills and the application of medical knowledge in the clinical setting. The CUSOM competency -based evaluation is based on the following core competencies in each area: 1) Osteopathic Philosophy and Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine 2) Medical Knowledge 3) Patient Care 4) Interpersonal and Communication Skills 5) Professionalism 6) Practice -Based Learni ng and Improvement 7) Systems -Based Practice During the curriculum delivery and assessment in all four years the staff, patients, and/or standardized patients with whom the student comes in contact may be asked to evaluate the student's communication and int erpersonal skills. These evaluations are primarily completed in the ambulatory and testing setting and are a part of the grading process. Students who fail a clinical rotation will be required to repeat that rotation. Students who have a repeat failure o r fail more than one clinical rotation will come before the APPS Committee. In addition, repeated performance evaluations in which items performed in a specific category or across categories are rated as never or seldom will 56 be reason for remediation at t he discretion of the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs in consultation with the clinical chair, the preceptor, and/or the APPS Committee. In general, students should show a progression of improvement in performance on clinical rotations. Those students who continually score in the \"unsatisfactory\" category or repeated \"performs some of the time, but needs improvement\" and do not improve over time may be deemed as not making academic progress and, as a result, may be required to complete additional curri culum or may be referred to the APPS Committee. Failure on a clinical rotation will result in academic probation. Failure to perform satisfactorily on two or more clinical rotations are referred to the APPS Committee and may result in an additional require d curriculum, repeat of an academic year, or dismissal from CUSOM. Poor ratings on the clinical evaluation in the professional and ethical areas of the assessment of a student are addressed by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and may result in a rem ediation appropriate to correct the deficient area. In the case of concerns in professional and/or ethical areas, the Associate Dean may refer the student to the Dean for an APPS Committee hearing. The Dean will act upon this referral depending on the severity and the area of the performance measure. Poor ratings in this area must be accompanied by comments as to the exact nature of the rating. Documentation: Students are required to maintain a log to identify the procedures performed and the number of e ssential patient encounters. The faculty member will verify logged information at the end of the rotation, either online using a password signature or by signing the log. Rotation Evaluations: Clinical rotation evaluation begins the first week. Students are to request feedback from the preceptor, (e.g., \"How am I doing?\", \"Are there things I should improve?\") by the end of the first and every week of each clinical rotation, in order to continually address areas that need improvement. This provides studen ts an opportunity to improve while on the rotation, and prevents unexpected poor evaluation at the end of the rotation. Students bear total responsibility to seek this ongoing feedback. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that all clinical evaluation forms are either completed online or turned in to the Clinical Affairs Office at the completion of each rotation. It is the student's responsibility to expediently inform the Clinical Affairs Office of any difficulty in obtaining an evaluation from the preceptor at the end of that rotation. The overall responsibility to assure evaluations have been completed and to ensure that the form has been returned to CUSOM (or site coordinator) remains with the student. For this reason, students are responsible for setting up a time for final evaluation during the final week of the rotation, requesting such a meeting at the beginning of the final week of the rotation. At this meeting, students should supply the preceptor with the evaluation form and an envelope a ddressed to the site coordinator (or ensure that the preceptor is completing the form online at the time of the evaluation). It will be CUSOM policy for students not to leave a rotation without the evaluation being discussed and signed by the preceptor. I f a rotation form is not completed and turned in to the site coordinator or Director of Clinical Rotations within 90 days of the rotation, the rotation may be considered not completed or failed. Students should check with the site coordinators monthly to assure they have received the evaluation. Clinical affairs staff may assist the student in obtaining an evaluation if a preceptor is negligent by refusing to complete the evaluation form or to turn it in to the regional coordinator. 5.7 Academic Progress Successful academic progress for students in years 1 and 2 includes passage of all courses in all Blocks, successfully completing all curricular requirements in the Blocks, passing all components of the end -of-year 57 testing, and/or meeting the requirements as set forth by the APPS Committee (for those students in a Modified Course of Study). Students must also demonstrate adequate development in professionalism as determined by the faculty and admini stration. Each student must pass the Comprehensive Osteopa thic Medical Licensing Examination (COMLEX) - USA Level 1 in order to be promoted to full MS -3 status. Successful academic progress for students in years MS -3 and MS -4 includes successful completion of rotations and post -rotation exams, and/or meeting the requirements as set forth by the APPS Committee for those students in a Modified Course of Study. Each student must pass COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE and COMLEX -USA Level 2 Physical Examination (PE) exams prior to graduation. Students who experience difficulty s uccessfully completing elements of the CUSOM curriculum or COMLEX exams in a timely manner according to the academic calendar may be placed into a combination curriculum/remediation program (Modified Course of Study). Students placed in a Modified Course of Study must sign and agree to comply with the plan approved by the Dean recommended by the Associate Dean. As long as the student is making satisfactory progress, they will remain in a full -time status. Students who do not follow the Modified Course of S tudy or who do not make academic progress on the modified course of study may be referred to the APPS Committee for additional required remediation, or dismissal from CUSOM. Fourth year students should refer to the Graduation Requirements section for infor mation about f urther graduation requirements. Students who are not making academic progress may be dismissed from CUSOM. 5.8 National Board Exams Students are required to pass the COMLEX -USA Level 1, COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE, and COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE prior t o graduation. Accommodations on COMLEX Exam s Students who request accommodations for COMLEX -USA Level 1 (COMLEX 1) must submit their applications directly to the NBOME at least 90 days prior to their COMLEX 1date in order to allow time for NBOME's decision . Therefore, students must request COMLEX 1 accommodations from NBOME in writing by April 15th to meet the end of July deadline for taking the exam. Please contact the NBOME directly for more information. 58 COMLEX -USA Level 1 CUSOM students will complete the Clinical Applications of Biome dical Sciences in Block 8, and MUST sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1 prior to July 31st in the period between the second and third academic year. Prior to receiving their COMLEX -USA Level 1 grade all students, including those on appeal, will be considered \"provisional\" third year students. Full third year status will be granted to all students passing COMLEX -USA Level 1. In order to sit for COMLEX 1, the student must achieve a pre -identified \"passing\" score on a qualifying exa m, such as the College of Osteopathic Medicine Self -Assessment Exam (COMSAE). CUSOM will identify the passing parameters by the end of Block 5. CUSOM will pay for the first exam with students responsible for the cost of subsequent exams. S tudents will h ave three attempts to pass this exam: the first opportunity at the beginning of Block 7, a second opportunity at the beginning of Block 8, and the third opportunity at the end of Block 8. Students will be permitted to register for COMLEX -USA Level 1 prior to passing this qualifying exam; however, students failing to meet the minimum pre -identified score will not be permitted to take COMLEX -USA Level 1. Students will be provided a mandatory board review course at the end of Block 8. This review course of study will be provided by CUSOM. Students who do not pass the qualifying exam after three attempts (including after the required review course) will be required to use their vacation, the first block of their third year, to take a remedial program identif ied by CUSOM at the student's expense. At the end of this remedial program, the student will be permitted to take COMLEX -USA Level 1. Failure of COMLEX -USA Level 1 Any student who fails COMLEX -USA Level 1 will be immediately placed on probation and, as de termined by the APPS Committee, may be withdrawn from clinical rotations until th ey successfully pass the exam. Any student who fails COMLEX -USA Level 1 must meet with the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs. The Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs wi ll assist the student in analyzing their deficiencies and developing a remediation plan. Students who fail COMLEX -USA Level 1 without successfully passing the qualifying exam will be required to take a residential review program at their own expense. Students who have been taken off rotations for a COMLEX -USA Level 1 failure will not be permitted to return to clinical rotations until they receive a passing score. Students who do not pass COMLEX -USA Level 1 after three attempts may be dismissed from school . COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE, and COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE Third year students must take and pass an end of rotation exam after each clinical rotation. In addition to demonstrating the student has learned the appropriate materials on the rotation, the exams funct ion to prepare students for COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE. In addition, students must take and pass Standardized Patient and Objective Structured Clinical Exams. These exams are done to assure the student has competently achieved the clinical skills expected in the third year and they will prepare the student for COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE testing. Students who fail the Standardized Patient or OSCE exams will be required to remediate the exam a minimum of 14 days prior to taking COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE. Students who do not successfully remediate will have their COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE release withdrawn. 59 Students are strongly recommended to take COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE by the end of December in the fourth year. This is recommended as it takes a minimum of 90 days to receive scores for COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE. If students fail COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE, they must have ample time to schedule and retake this exam prior to graduation. Passing of both COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE and COMLEX -USA Leve l 2 PE is required to graduate. In addit ion, most residency programs require passage of COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE to match with their program. Some residencies require proof of passing COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE prior to interviewing for residency. Failure of COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE or COMLEX Level 2 PE who fail COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE or PE MUST meet with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs to develop an individualized remediation plan and must follow that plan. Students who fail COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE or COMLEX -USA Level 2 PE may be allowed to continue in fourth year rotations. Passage of both COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE and COMLEX -USA PE is required in order to graduate. Students who do not pass both CE and PE by graduation will be suspended. Students on suspension do not qualify for financial ai d. Students will not be removed from suspension until they demonstrate a passing score on the deficient exam(s). Students on suspension for a period exceeding six months will be reviewed by the APPS Committee and may be dismissed from CUSOM. A modified c ourse of study is individually planned based upon the student's performance and needs. Students are required to complete the modified course of study designed by the Dean (in consultation with the Associate Deans). Students not following the individualiz ed plan for remediation may be suspended at any time. If a student decides upon an immersion course and is removed from fourth year clinical rotations, a Modified Course of Study may be designed by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs upon approval by the Dean. Students must pass COMLEX -USA Level 1, COMLEX -USA Level 2 CE and PE . They will be allowed a maximum of three attempts for each of these exams. Failure to pass each of these exams may result in dismissal. 5.9 Academic Probation In addition to the policies above, students will be automatically placed on academic probation for the following reasons: the student receives an \"F\" at the end of the Block in any course or clinical experience, or the student fails to score a 70% or above on the post rota tion exam on the second attempt, or the student fails to successfully complete a portion of the COMLEX exam in the expected time frame The record of each student on academic probation will be reviewed by the APPS Committee each Block or clinical rotation t o evaluate the student's academic progress. At the end of any block where the student on academic probation earns grades below 70%, the APPS Committee may recommend promotion to the following year, repetition of the year just completed, repetition of a sp ecific course or system, make -up examinations, summer courses, or dismissal. In general, students are not allowed to repeat a n entire course more than once. The APPS Committee may , on a rare occasion , allow a student to repeat a course or Block. Students may appeal the decision of the APPS Committee to the Dean based upon new and compelling information not available to the APPS Committee at the time of the decision. NOTE \"F\" grades: A student who earned a grade of \"F\" initially and is eligible to remediat e the course will have the grade reported as In Progress (\"IP\") on his/her transcript until the prescribed remediation is attempted 60 and a new grade is issued. The Registrar will report current \"IP\" grades to the appropriate Associate Dean at t he time the \"IP\" is assigned. Once an \"IP\" grade has been officially changed to a letter grade on the transcript, the Registrar will not retain a record of \"IP\" courses as part of the academic record. The appropriate Associate Dean, however, maintains a listing of previously satisfied F grades in courses and will report such grades to the APPS Committee as needed for assessment of the student's overall academic performance and progress. Students who fail to remediate a grade of \"F\" will have failed the course and receive an F on the transcript. If a student is allowed by the APPS Committee to repeat a failed course, the F will remain on the transcript. The highest grade that can be given for a remediated course is 70% . The new grade, if remediated successfully, will have the letter grade C or P with an asterisk (C* or P*, respectively) associated with the course to reflect a repeated course on the transcript. The grade of C* represents a remediated, passed graded course, and a P* represents a remediated, passed Pass -Fail course. A student may receive any of the following grades for a clinical rotation: Honors, High Pass, Pass, or Fail. A successfully remediated clinical rotation will be represented on the transcript as PC*, with the asterisk denoting a remediated rotation. 5.10 Modified Courses of Study Students who are placed into a Modified Course of Study by the Dean or either Associate Dean for Biomedical / Clinical Affairs are required to sign the documented Modified Course of Study. Students who do not compl y with the Modified Course of Study may be suspended at any time by the Dean for failure to follow the plan. If a student has difficulty in following the assigned Modified Course of Study, they must meet with the Dean, or appropriate Associate Dean. Stude nts following a Modified Course of Study should be aware that they must be on track to complete all requirements to graduate by July 1st to enter ERAS and the Match. Students who fail COMLEX Level 2 PE or CE after the match and complete grad uation require ments after July 1 st may lose their matched position; this decision is made by the residency program director and/or director of medi cal education at the respective hospital. 5.11 Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee The APPS Comm ittee in conjunction with the Office of Academic Affairs monitors the academic progress achieved by students throughout the academic program. The APPS C ommittee meets at the end o f any block in which a student has achieved a failing course g rade, f ailed to successf ully remediate an F, f ailed a course while on A cademic Probation, or when a delay in a student's acade mic progress is identified. The Dean o r the appropriate Associate Dean for the acade mic year involved may also call a meeting of the APPS C ommittee i n cases where the academic progress of a student is affected by leaves of absence or other similar factors. APPS C ommittee meeting s are not held for remediation or an \"in progress grade\" un less a repeat less than 70 or unsatisfactory grade is achieved. Additionally, the APPS Committee is responsible for the review of situations where students are involved in academic misconduct (i.e., cheating or plagiarism) or nonprofessional conduct. The Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine Honor Cod e published elsewhere in the Academic Bulletin shall guide this review . The APPS C ommittee is composed of following voting m embers: the Associate Dean f or Biomedical A ffairs, the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, the Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and R esearch, the Executive Director for Student Affairs and four faculty members to include at least one pri mary care clinical faculty 61 member, one specialty clinical faculty member, and one biomedical faculty member. The Dean appoints faculty memb ers. A quorum is defined a s a simple majority of members present in person or by teleconference. Non-voting members who may attend are the Registrar, the Assistant to the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, the Administrative Assistant for Academic Affai rs (who serves as secretary/recorder) , Director of Financial Aid and others deemed appropriate . As this is not considered a legal hearing and is instead an academic proceeding, attorneys or other representatives are not allowed. Additional non- voting at tendees who may attend the meeting include the Class President, the Course Director for a failed course, and/ or the Chair for a failed rotation. All non-voting members with the exception of the secretary are dismissed pri or to deliberation and voting. Procedures for Calling and Conducting an APPS Committee Meeting APPS Committee meetings are held at the end of each block, after the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs and/or the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs have determined all grades. Additionall y, the Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Research will call for an APPS Committee hearing and serve as the Chair of the APPS Committee if a student has: Failed a course or system Attempted and failed to remediate a course resulting in an F Failed to pass all courses while on Academic Probation Failed any clinical rotations Failed a post -rotation exam twice Experienced repeated failures in the end of year testing exams Suspicion of any violation of the CUSOM Honor Code after appropriate prelimin ary procedures have occurred Failed to pass an appropriate COMLEX -USA exam in the time frame required Demonstrated inability to make academic progress by any other academic measures the faculty and/or administration have approved or for remediation programs including an altered degree plan, remediation courses assigned on or off campus, and/or other directed CUSOM curriculum. APPS Committee P rocedures for Academic Performance Matters The Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Research will Chair the APPS Committee. Members of the APPS Comm ittee have the following roles: The appropriate Associate Dean for the academic year involved will report on the academic progress of the student(s). The Associate Dean will submit a written repo rt documenting a ssistance that the student has received or been offered, including but not limited to tutoring or advising. The Executive Director for Student Affairs will report on documentation that the Office of Student Affairs may have which may be relevant to the stu dent's academic progress. The Registrar will have the student's entire academic record available (course evaluations, performance assessments and the student's transcript) for the members to reference if needed. The Administrative Assistant for Academic Af fairs shall serve as the secretary recording minutes and ensuring all communication occurs in a timely manner. Each student coming before the APPS Committee will be allowed a ten minute presentation of any issues or considerations that they wish to make kn own to the APPS Committee. Members of the APPS Committee may then direct questions to the student. This is the only portion of the meeting at which the student may be physically present. 62 The Course Director or Chair will represent the student's interacti ons in trying to achieve a passing grade within the course or on the rotation. For issues arising from Honor Code violations, the Executive Director for Student Affairs will report on documentation that the Office of Student Affairs may have which may be r elevant to the alleged violation of the Honor Code. This may include a verbal report from faculty involved with the incident(s). In the case where students are involved with reporting the breach, confidentiality of the reporting student will be maintaine d and the Executive Director for Student Affairs will represent the student's testimony. See below under Non- Academic Matters. In matters concerning student academic performance, the director(s) of the course(s) failed will be present at APPS Committee me etings to explain course procedures, grading, and to clarify any remediation processes that are available for that course only. He/she and the student representative will not vote and will be excused prior to deliberations. For students deemed to not be m aking academic progress, including multiple grades in the I or IP range in one block or across more than one block or an F grade, following deliberations the APPS Committee may make recommendations including but not limited to the following for final acti on by the Dean: Award of a satisfactory grade (70%) and promotion to the next block following satisfactory remediation Require remediation, further coursework, or repeat of a course Require one or more additional clinical rotations with satisfactory perfor mance Place, not place, or extend the student 's term on academic probation Require more frequent meetings with faculty advisors with those students on academic probation Specify a timeline or manner in which any remediation must occur. Make a determination for dismissal, or repeat of academic year. Determine the need for and/or require further assessment prior to making sure the student has the ability to make satisfactory progress to become an osteopathic physician including but not limited to: psychologic al evaluations, drug or alcohol screening / testing, or other evaluations required by the APPS Committee to make an appropriate decision. Such testing will be at the student's expense. The APPS Committee will require a written evaluation from the party o f the referral to determine if the student is at risk or presents a risk to the institution, students, or patient care. Suspension with reinstatement pending satisfactory performance. Suspension of a student with reinstatement decisions pending further eva luation and treatment. Repeat of multiple courses in which the student initially earned a F grade, Repeat of an entire academic year, or Assignment of a Modified Course of Study that will delay promotion until satisfactory a progress through a directed rem ediation program has occurred, or dismissal. The APPS Committee generally recommends dismissal of a student when the student demonstrates that he/she is unable to make academic progress through: Multiple failures in a preclinical Block An F grade on a modi fied course of study A history of multiple conditional grades and an F Failure of two or more clinical rotations in one academic year Failure to pass any courses while on Academic Probation Failure and cumulative evidence that demonstrate the student is not gaining the appropriate knowledge and/or qualifications to become an osteopathic physician Any other issues deemed relevant. 63 The appropriate Associate Dean will notify the student of the outcome of the APPS Committee meeting and any sanctions if applicab le. Upon notification, the student may appeal the decision in writing to the Dean within seven calendar days of notification. The appeal should be based upon new and relevant information. The Dean will normally reply within 14 working days of receiving the written appeal. The Dean will not meet with the student prior to receiving the written appeal material. In the case of an appeal, the student may appeal to the Dean based only upon new and meaningful information not available to the Dean at the time o f his or her decision. The Dean's decision will be final. APPS Committ ee Procedures for Non -academic M atters When there is a suspicion of misconduct by a student, investigation and appropriate actions may be pursued either by the professor of the course i n which the alleged misconduct occurred or by the APPS Committee membership if suspicion of academic misconduct is reported by a CUSOM student. In either case, the accused student has the right to appeal any action by the faculty to the APPS Committee, in which case normal Committee procedures will be followed. Charges of misconduct may arise from a student (or group of students), professor, adjunct professor or preceptor. Within three (3) days of the alleged misconduct or discovery of alleged misconduct , the accuser(s) should discuss the situation with either the Execut ive Director for Student Affairs or the professor in charge of the course. Dated notes should be taken to describe the discussion. Every effort should be made to maintain confidentiality in these discussions. If the accuser(s) has (have) opted to bring the matter before the Executive Director for Student Affairs , the appropriate Associate Dean should meet with the professor and the chairperson of the APPS Committee to explore options. This meeting should take place no longer than five (5) days after the matter was brought to the attention of the Associate Dean. The options available for resol ution of the situation include: The professor can opt to deal with the situation, in which case the student(s) must be informed of allegations and afforded an opportunity to defend him/herself. Faculty decisions must be reported to the APPS Committee for tracking purposes. The case can be referred to the APPS Committee for resolution. Referral to t he committee must be by a written memo which names the student, describes the alleged misconduct (including times), and summarizes the content of earlier meetings regarding this case. Within five (5) days of referral of the case to the APPS Committee, the chairperson of the committee will provide a copy of the referral memo to the accused student(s). In addition, the chairperson will schedule an initial hearing for any charged student with the Committee. This hearing should be held within ten (10) days of the referral of the case to the Committee. The chairperson will ask the Executive Director of Student Affairs to begin a preliminary investigation of the allegations. Whenever possible, this should include a personal interview with the student, witnesses, and professor involved. Preliminary findings shall be presented at the initial meeting wi th the APPS Committee. The Executive Director of Student Affairs shall objectively present his/her findings to the Committee. The accused student(s) shall meet with the Committee and be informed of the allegations and afforded an opportunity to defend him/hersel f. Although the hearing 's purpose is explor atory and fact finding , the accused student does have the right to solicit advice and to offer witnesses to suppo rt his /her position. 64 The Committee shall vote on whether or not preliminary findings , based upon a preponderance of the evidence, warrant a full hearing by a simple majority vote. If a hearing is deemed necessary, the Chair will notify the student and wit nesses of the hearing date in writing at least three (3) days prior to the hearing. A waiver of his/her notice may be made if the student so chooses. A full hearing should be held within ten (10) days of the preliminary investigation. If the Committee v otes that no hearing is warranted, the case will be dismissed. The chairperson will file the minutes in the permanent files of the APPS Committee and a copy shall be placed in the Dean's Office. Should additional information become available, the chairpe rson may reopen the case and ask the Committee t o consider the new information. All sessions of the Committee will be closed to all individuals except those immediately concerned in the case. No attorney shall be present, as this is not a court of law. A ll persons present at the proceedings shall be bound to disclose no more than the Committee does in its official report on the case. Revelation of such details will be considered a violation of the Honor Code. The testimony of each witness shall be given while the other witnesses in the case are out of the room . The Committee may allow introduction of evidence other than testimony of witnesses provided that the evidence is relevant to the question before the Committee on any matter. The Committee shall set rules for the conduct of all cases and all arrangements connected with taking evidence. Time frames for instigation of hearings and proceedings may be altered if circumstances warrant. Deliberation of the Committee shall take place in private and rem ain confidential. Voting on decisions of guilt shall be by secret ballot and determined by a simple majority. If the Committee determines that the student was in violation of the Honor Code, it will consider and recommend the appropriate penalty. The st udent should be informed immediately of the decision and if a violation(s) is determined, the recommended penalty . The CUSOM Dean may uphold or reject any decision or penalty recommended by the Committee. A letter from the Dean's office will serve as the official notice of the outcome of the proceedings. Penalties for violation of institutional policies or rules and regulations may be administered regardless of whether the actions of the student are also civil or criminal violations. Whenever disciplinary actions lead to the student leaving CUSOM, grades will be assigned in accordance with the CUSOM grading policy. The APPS Committee may recommend imposition of one or more of the following behavioral penalties upon individuals determined t o have violated the Honor Code: Admonition: This consists of a verbal or written warning. Admonitions will not become a part of the student's longitudinal record and may not be reviewed or appealed by the student. Ineligibility for election and/or removal from student of fice or organizational office for specified period of time. Withholding of official tran script, barring re -admission to CUSOM, and/or blocking a student from enrolling for a specified period of time. Restitution, whether monetary or by specifi c duties, or reimbursement for damages to or misappropriation of CUS OM, student, staff, or faculty property. Academic sanctions: Writing a paper, reduction of grade on an examination, assignment, or course; repetition of a course(s); being assigned additional clinic or laboratory activities or coursework; repeating of an exam, coursework, or even an entire academic year or semester or other appropriate penalties. Conduct Probation: A penalty levied for a specific time, the duration of which will be determined by the seriousness of the circumstances. It carries with it a warning that any further violations of CUSOM regulations will result in more serious disciplinary action. Conduct probation will be removed from the 65 student's longitudinal record in the Office of Stud ent Affairs. Disciplinary Probation: A penalty for a definite period determined by the circumstances of the case. This is the mos t severe penalty under which a student may remain at CUSOM. Disciplinary probation may result in a warning that further viola tions may be cause for disciplinary suspension or expulsion. A record of the disciplinary probation remains a part of the student's longitudinal record in the Office of Student Affairs . Suspension: This penalty may be imposed for continued and/or flagrant violation of the disciplinary probation terms, or it may be imposed directly in first offense cases that warrant such action. In the case of suspension, the student will be barred from all campus and non- campus activities. Withdrawal: Withdrawal is admin istrative removal of a student from a class or from CUSOM and may be imposed in instances of unmet financial obligation to CUSOM evaluation. The withdrawn student may also be barred from re -enrollment until such time as specific conditions have been m et. Expulsion: Expulsi on is permanent severance from CUSOM. Revocation of Degree: The revocation of degree may occur for discovered misconduct of prior students. Allegations of misconduct, which may result in a revocation of a granted degree, will be conside red by the Dean. All minutes and evidence shall be placed in the permanent files of the APPS Committee, and a copy will be sent to the Dean's Office where it shall remain until the student graduates or leaves CUSOM. Special Meetings of the APPS Committee The Dean may call a meeting of the APPS Committee to determine placement of a student who has taken an approved extended leave, or has been on suspension to determine where the student will pick up in the curriculum and to determine if any additional curric ulum is needed. The appropriate Associate Dean will chair special meetings of the APPS Committee and the role of voting and non-voting members will be the same as specified above. All minutes and evidence shall be placed in the permanent files of the APPS Committee, and a copy will be sent to the Dean's Office. If a matter is determined to be a potential violation of law, the Dean (or Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs in the Dean's absence) will be notified as soon as possible for referral to appr opriate law enforcement authorities. All CUSOM students, faculty, and staff witnessing a crime in progress are expected to notify law enforcement immediately, while taking personal safety precautions. 5.12 Withdrawal/Leave Procedures Withdrawal All reques ts for withdrawal must be made in writing to the office of the Executive Director for Student Affairs and must follow the following steps: A voluntary withdrawal is requested in writing through the Office of the Executive Director for Student Affairs . The student must complete an Change of Status Form and return the form and any designated CUSOM issued items to the Office of the Registrar before the student will be considered \"withdrawn in good standing\" The date for a voluntary withdrawal will be the dat e of the student's written request. Upon receipt of the completed Change of Status Form and CUSOM issued items, the student will be voluntarily withdrawn (in good standing) from CUSOM and entitled to certain benefits, i.e., application for readmission or a n official transcript if requested. 66 Any pre -approved leave of absence (to extend no longer than six months) will require completion of an Change of Status Form and may or may not require the return of CUSOM issued items (depending upon the specific circumst ances of the leave of absence). The Dean, however, makes the final d ecision regarding withdrawals. Students who discontinue their education at CUSOM, for any reason, will be required to complete a withdrawal or Change of Status Form. Medical Leave of Absence (absence of less than 180 days) A medical leave of absence is granted to students who provide documentation and are deemed to have a medical reason requiring the leave. The Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs and/or the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs may make the initial determination . The medical l eave is determined by the Dean. A medical leave may last no longer than six months or the student is el igible for medical withdrawal. For students who are in good academic standing and returning fr om a medical leave, the Dean, Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs, and the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs will determine the student's placement within the curriculum upon the student's return from the approved medical leave of absence with a physic ian release to return. Medical Withdrawal (absence greater than 180 days) A medical withdrawal is granted to students who have an approved medical reason that exceeds six months. Students may apply for re -admission if granted a medical withdrawal. The Ad missions Committee will determine acceptance; the Associate Deans will determine placement for all students who have withdrawn for medical purposes and are in good academic standing. The APPS Committee must meet about all students who are not in good academic standing to determine eligibility for reinstatement an d for placement if reinstated. Military Withdrawal Military withdrawal is granted to students whose military reserve obligations may require a period of absence from the academic program when they are called to extended active duty. Readmission is guaranteed pending proof of compliance with the minimal technical standards and the Honor Code . If the student returns within five years, they will be placed in the curriculum as close to their current p osition as possible in order to provide them the appropriate continuum in the curriculum and the training required to be successful, competent, and able to perform well on their board exams. In any case, the student will not be charged any additional tuit ion from their original obligation. The Dean and Associate Deans will meet with the individual student to determine the appropriate curriculum to be completed in the remainder of the degree program that will bring the student to a competency level equal t o his or her peer. Personal Withdrawal Personal withdrawal will be granted to students who wish to voluntarily leave CUSOM for personal reasons. Students withdrawing from CUSOM are not guaranteed re -admission. To be deemed withdrawing in good standing, the student must complete all paperwork and follow all CUSOM procedures during the withdrawal process. Administrative Leave of Absence An administrative leave of absence is granted by the Dean. An administrative leave may last no longer than six months as deemed appropriate and necessary. An administrative leave of absence is rare and is present to address 67 such situations as a death of a spouse, child, or such other severe circumstance that would i nterrupt a student's education. Suspension Suspension is defined as a temporary separation from the institution. The duration of the suspension will be determined by the Dean and may include recommendations from the APPS Committee or the Professional Ethics Standards Board, or CUSOM's Honor Code Committee. Stud ents may be assigned independent studies during suspension to remain current; however, these independent studies do not replace course attendance or rotation requirements. If the terms set out under the suspension are not fulfilled and the period of suspe nsion is six months or greater, the student may be dismissed from CUSOM Dismissal Dismissal from CUS OM will be based upon recommendations made by the APPS Committee, with final approval for dismissal by the Dean . Unofficial Involuntary Withdrawal (Pending) Any student who ceases to maintain adequate academic attendance in CUSOM will be considered for an involuntary withdrawal. Overall Withdrawal Policies Failure to complete a Change of Status Form and to obtain the proper signatures will result in a hold placed on all academic records. Tuition refunds will be based upon the schedule shown under the section on Refund Policy. Failure to provide documentation in a timely manner could result in a guaranteed readmission becoming void. For any withdrawal, volun tary or involuntary, CUSOM recognizes and follows the date of determination as defined by the U.S. Department of Education in its Code of Federal Regulations . 5.13 Graduation Requirements The degree of Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine is granted to and confe rred upon candidates who: A. Have demonstrated good moral, professional, and ethical character; B. Have satisfied all academic requirements; C. Have passed the COMLEX -USA Level 1, COMLEX level 2 CE, and COMLEX -USA level 2 PE; and D. Completed all required exit pa perwork and settled all financial obligations with CUSOM and affiliate and collaborative partners incurred during as a result of the academic program. To become eligible for graduation, each fourth- year student must have successfully completed all the abov e requirements within six years of matriculation. The six years allow for the student to have been in a delayed program due to medical, academic, and/or behavioral leaves of absence. Professional and ethical competence is required for graduation. Studen ts must demonstrate the ethical and professional qualities deemed necessary for success and continued study and practice of osteopathic medicine; the suitability for the practice of medicine by dutiful and responsible acceptance for patient care; and must demonstrate integrity in the conduct of clinical duties. Students may be dismissed from CUSOM if any of these 68 competencies are not met. A student must have completed all curricular requirements at CUSOM, or a minimum of two years at CUSOM and another eli gible institution which is accredited by the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) or Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), between the date of matriculation and graduation. In addition to this requirement, the student must have been enrolled full time at CUSOM during their third and fourth academic years. A CUSOM student must complete to the satisfaction of faculty, as determined by the individual course directors and clinical rotations supervisors and through the APPS Committee, all prescribed courses and clinical experiences to graduate. The Dean makes the determination on any appeals from promotion board recommendations, based solely upon new and meaningful information not available to the APPS Committee a t the time of the del iberation. The Dean makes the determination on any appeal from the Dean's recommendation, based solely upon new and meaningful information not available to the Dean at the time of his or her decision. Students must meet with the Assistant Director of Fina ncial Aid and Registrar to complete all required exit forms and/or to receive a diploma. CUSOM students must attend the exit process and the commencement program to receive a diploma. 5.14 Delayed Graduation Policy If an osteopathic medical student is required to re -take courses in the curriculum as a result of specific course failure or a deficiency in overall academic performance, then a delay in scheduling clinical rotations will occur and the student's graduation will be delayed. Voluntary course wit hdrawals, temporary leaves of absence or suspensions secondary to academic, administrative suspensions or as a result of failure to pass boards consistent with CUSOM policy will also cause a delay in scheduling clinical rotations and a delay in graduation. Any alteration in the normal curriculum progression may affect a student's financial aid status or qualification for education- based financial aid. Specific counseling and advice should be sought from the School's Office of Academic Affairs and the Univ ersity's Office of Financial A id for a particular situation. 5.15 Clinical Policies and Procedures Please see the CUSOM Clinical Rotation Manual for Student Policies relating to all clinical rotations. This manual will be made available to the students during year 2. 5.16 Academic Freedom Policy Academic freedom refers to the environment provided by the University that permits faculty and students to engage in their scholarly pursuits of teaching, research, and related activities at institutions of higher education. Academic freedom embodies the University's mission of creating new knowledge and the effective communication of cumulated knowledge. This policy applies to faculty members and students at Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine. As an academic institution, Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine exists to educate and prepare community -based osteopathic physicians in a Christian environment to care for the rural and underserved populations in North Carolina, the Southeaste rn United States and the nation. Free inquiry and free expression are indispensable to the attainment of CUSOM's goals. As members of the academic community, faculty and students are encouraged to develop the capacity for critical judgment and to engage i n a sustained and independent search for truth. 69 Freedom to teach and freedom to learn are inseparable facets of academic freedom. The freedom to learn depends upon appropriate opportunities and conditions in the classroom, on the campus, and in the larger community. The University, the faculty and students have a responsibility to protect and promote the learning process in all endeavors. CUSOM affirms its commitment to academic freedom, and adopts the following statement of academic freedom principles ap plicable to faculty and students. Faculty and students are expected to remember the public may judge the profession and institution by their utterances. Hence, faculty and students agree at all times to be accurate, to exercise appropriate restraint, and to show respect for the opinions of others. Campbell University Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine subscribes fully to the 1940 Statement of Principles of the American Association of University Professors regarding academic freedom: Faculty is entitled to freedom in the classroom. The faculty member is responsible, however, for maintaining academic standards in the presentation of course materials. As members of the academic community, students should be encouraged to develop the capacity for critical judgment and to engage in a sustained and independent search for the truth. Faculty and students in the classroom and in conference should encourage free discussion, inquiry, and expression. Student performance should be evaluated solely on a n academic basis, not on opinions or conduct in matters unrelated to academic standards. Students should be free to take reasoned exception to the information or views offered in any course of study and to reserve judgment about matters of opinion, but students are responsible for learning the content of the course of study in which they are enrolled. Students should have protection through orderly grievance procedures against prejudiced or capricious evaluations. At the same time, students are responsible for complying with the standards of academic performance established by the School. Faculty members are entitled to full freedom in research or other services of his/her own undertaking, and in the publication of the results, subject to the adequate performance of other academic duties. When faculty and students speak or write as members of the community, they are free from institutional censorship or discipline, but they are expected to remember the public may judge the profession and institution by their utterances. Students and faculty may not represent themselves verbally, in print, or electronically (including use of Campbell University logos, titles, letterhead, or stationery) as representing Campbell University without the express written permission of the Dean. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal from the School. The teacher is entitled to full freedom in research and in the publication of the results, subject to the adequate performance of his other ac ademic duties; but research for pecuniary return must be based upon an understanding with the authorities of the institution in advance of the acceptance of employment. 6. Osteopathic Medicine Curriculum 6.1 Years 1 and 2 The first two years of CUSOM's cur riculum focus on teaching students fundamental principles of biomedical science with significant emphasis on clinical science, elements of clinical practice, and professionalism. Historically, the first two years of medical school instruction have been vi ewed as \"pre- clinical\" with the 70 remaining two years being viewed as \"clinical\". At CUSOM, the curriculum is highly integrated to provide a core of strong biomedical principles in addition to a robust found ation in clinical sciences and o steopathic princip les, principles of clinical practice, and professionalism. In years one and two, content is presented in integrated course series delivered in 9 -week blocks over four semesters. The week between Blocks is vacation time for students unless remediation is warranted. Each course series contains specific courses and content typical of those found among osteopathic medicine curricula nationwide. More detailed and specific course descriptions are contained elsewhere in the Academic Bulletin. Foundations in Bi omedical Science - Blocks 1 and 2 are primarily fundamental basic sciences (e.g., Anatomy, Biochemistry, Cell Biology, Genetics, Microbiology/Immunology/Virology, Pharmacology and Physiology). Content in these courses is coordinated, and integrative case exercises at the end of each week demonstrate application to clinical problems. Organ Systems - In Blocks 3 -8 basic and clinical sciences are integrated through organ system -based instruction, with material specific to each system and its disease states. Clinical Skills and Neuromusculoskeletal Medicine - Students receive extensive training in osteopathic principles and practice (OPP) and osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM). The Clinical Skills program (CS) includes didactic instruction supplemented by practice using simulation, standardized patients, and early clinical experiences (ECE). Foundations in Medical Practice (FMP) - includes epidemiology, research skills, and evidence -based medicine. Professional Core- Competencies (PCC) - focuses on the sev en AOA Core Competencies including medical humanities, health systems, global health, ethics, and professionalism . Curricular Content Overview All semesters of the first and second year are partitioned into two 9 -week blocks. Within the first two blocks th e Foundations in Biomedical Science series is designed to introduce students to the basic concepts of Anatomical Sciences, Biochemistry, Immunology, Microbiology, Cellular and Metabolic Pathology, Pharmacology, and Physiology. Anatomical Sciences continues throughout the first year, integrating wherever possible with the systems approach of the remaining three semesters of the first two years. In blocks three through eight, the CUSOM curriculum uses an organ- systems approach to medical education. Lecturer s present instructional materials that go beyond the basic principles mastered during the first semester. Basic scientists, primary care physicians, and sub -specialty physicians deliver this material as it relates to the particular system. Clinical Skills and Neuromusculoskeletal Medicine address content that wi ll allow CUSOM students to learn and thrive in the basic philosophy, principles, and practice of osteopathic medicine. Hands -on diagnosis and treatment is the foundation of osteopathic whole -person health care. L ectures and labs incorporate state of the art instruction. Additionally, simulation and standardized patient experiences, allow students to enhance their clinical skills such as physical exam techniques, interviewing, counseling, and medic al reporting skills necessary to progress to the 3rd an d 4th years. S tudents are also introduced to Early Clinical Experiences with community physicians within the region. The Foundations in Medical Practice (FMP) course provides CUSOM students with clini cally relevant knowledge and instruction in topics directly related to competent medical practice. Through the use of lectures, 71 cases, and self -directed learning modules, students through all semesters of years 1 and 2 learn relevant applicable skills in Evidence -Based Medical Practice, the effective use of Bioinformatics, Epidemiology, evidence- based diagnostics, as well as basic biomedical research skills and methods. The Professional Core Competencies (PCC) course is presented through all semesters of t he first and second year curriculum, and is designed to teach those core competencies necessary throughout the physician's career. Through the use of lecture, discussion, and other unique activities, students are introduced to and master such topics as Medical Humanities, Biomedical Ethics, Medical Law and Jurisprudence, Global Health Issues, and professionalism. Sample weekly calendar Please see the following sample calendar weeks. Actual weekly schedules vary based on course content and space needs. Lectures primarily take place in the morning, with labs and clinical skills taking place in the afternoons. MS-1 sample week: 72 Morning lecture -discussions are complemented by afternoon labs and skills sessions, with embedded study time. OMM and other clini cal skills are taught longitudinally throughout the two years in a progression designed to integrate with and provide seam less entry into the third and fourth years. Content is presented by physicians and basic scientists using concepts of t eam teaching and team learning. Evaluation includes integrated exams, quizzes, and end -of-block and end- of-year evaluat ions. Weekly team - based case exercises help students remain on top of material presented during the week, and provide faculty with assessment of student progress. MS-2 sample week: 6.2 Years 3 and 4 CUSOM students in years three and four will be assigned to regional hospital sites. The site assignment will take place during the second year. Clinical experiences occur within hospital sites for inpati ent experiences, in ambulatory practices, and in geriatric acute care facilities. All students will spend time in rural small and /or critical access hospitals for an underserved care experience. Didactic and online curriculum for the educational program in each institution will be provided by CUSOM. Sample rotation schedules for years 3 and 4 are illustrated below. Time distribution reflects the mission to prepare primary care physicians for underserved areas, while preparing students to enter residency in any specialty . 73 MS-3 Clinical Blocks Block 9 Block 10 Block 11 Block 12 Block 13 Block 14 Block 15 Block 16 Block 17 Block 18 Block 19 Block 20 Block 21 VAC IM 1 IM 2 MS SUR R/U/I OBG PED PSY FM ELEC SIM CAA KEY : VAC = Vacation; IM = Intern al Medicine; MS = Medical Selective; SUR = Surgery; R/U/I = OBG = Obstetrics/Gynecology; Psychiatry; FM = Family Medicine; ELEC = Elective; SIM = Simulation Medicine . Third Year Clinical Rotations CUSOM's third year osteopathic medical students will be required to complete twelve rotations. Each rotation is estimated to consist of approximately 160 contact hours. The required rotations for third year are listed below; all rotations must be taken and completed at CUSOM core rotation sites. These rotations must be successfully completed to progress to the fourth year. Internal Medicine I, II (8 weeks) Medical Selective (4 weeks) Surgery (4 weeks) Obstetrics/Gynecology (4 weeks) Family Pract ice (4 weeks) Pediatrics (4 weeks) Psychiatry/Behavioral Sci. (4 weeks) Rural/Underserved/International (4 weeks) Simulation Lab (4 weeks) Elective (4 weeks) Clinical Academic Assessment (4 weeks) Clinical Modules Self-Study Clinical Modul es will be made available on clinical rotations. Appropriate for third - and fourth- year students, these modules can be accessed to fit students' schedules and needs whether traveling, on rotation, or at home. They are meant to supplement topics which should be covered on clinical rotations. They are also meant to act as study guides for both the end of rotation exams as well as COMLEX level 2. Self-Study Clinical Modules are not meant to replace the extensive reading, studying, patient contact, etc. stud ents must achieve on clinical rotations. Students will be provided with required curriculum during the third year. Learning objectives will be provided for the core discipline rotations as well as reading assignments. Examinations A post -rotation exam wi ll be given after the following third year rotations: Internal Medicine I, II Surgery Obstetrics/Gynecology 74 Family Practice Pediatrics Psychiatry /Behavioral Science Students who do not pass a post -rotation exam will be given one chance to remediate. If th e exam is failed twice, the student will be given an F (Fail) for the entire rotation and must repeat the rotation as well as the end of rotation examination. A student failing a clinical rotation will be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion an d Standards (APPS) Committee. Students must also pass the comprehensive exam at the end of the year (Clinical Academic Assessment) in order to progress to fourth year. Selective and Elective Rotations Medicine Selective Rotations All electives require prior approval by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. Elective* rotations include: All rotations outlined in the third year core All rotations included in the medical selective list The additional rotations of: Occupational Medicine, Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, OMM, International Medical Missions, Psychiatry, Allergy/Immunology, Forensic Pathology, Pathology, Dermatopathology, Sports Medicine, Pediatric subspecialties, Addiction Medicine, Adolescent Medicine, Maternal/Fetal Medicine, Reproductive Endocrinology, Radiology, Dermatology, Palliative Care, Gynecology, Biomedical or Clinical Research, , Proctology, Pain Management , Urgent Care, Rural Medicine, CDC, NIH, or other federally sponsored rotations. *Other electives not included may be arranged on a case- by-case basis if approved by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. A Clinical Performance Examination also will be given to assess clinical skills at the end of the third year. Students must take and pass this Objective Structured Clinical Examination ( OSCE) in order to progress to the fourth year. Exams cover the Learning Objectives in the Clinical Clerkship Manual and the material found in the web -based instruction. Students must successfully pass the Comprehensive MS -3 examinations prior to taking required fourth- year rotations and prior to being released to sit for COMLEX Level 2- CE examination. 75 MS-4 Cli nical Blocks Block 22 Block 23 Block 24 Block 25 Block 26 Block 27 Block 28 Block 29 Block 30 Block 31 Block 32 Block 33 VAC EM SUB I ELEC 1 PCS MS 1 MS 2 ELEC 2 GER ELEC 3 ELEC 4 SS KEY : VAC = Vacation; IM = Internal Medicine; MS = Medical SUR = Surgery; R/U/I = OBG = Obstetrics/Gynecology; Psychiatry; FM = Family Medicine; ELEC = Elective; SIM = Simulation Medicine ; EM = Emergency Medicine; SUB I = Sub -Internship; PCS = Primary Care Sel ective; GER = Geriatrics; SS = Surgical Selective. Fourth Year Clinical Rotations To become eligible for graduation, each fourth year student must have passed COMLEX - USA Level 2 -CE and PE. CUSOM's fourth year osteopathic medical students will be requir ed to complete the following clinical rotations. Medical Selective I and II (8 weeks) Primary Care Selective (4 weeks) Surgical Selective (4 weeks) Geriatrics (4 weeks) Sub-internship (4 weeks) Emergency Medicine (4 weeks) Electives I, II, III , IV (16 weeks) NOTE : Minimum requirements for clinical rotations are 160 hours each for four-week rotations, and 80 hours each for two -week rotation. The Primary Care, Medical, and Surgical selectives will be completed at CUSOM sites where CUSOM has establish ed rotations, affiliation agreements, and faculty. Limited exceptions may be granted; students may apply for up to two selectives in an outside region where AOA post -graduate programs exist. Most rotations will be scheduled on a four-week basis. The sch eduling document accommodates for the approved two week rotations Choosing In -Region Medicine and Surgical Selectives Students request dates, specialties and include desired preceptor if known. The Office of Clinical Affairs will schedule the rotations according to the availability of rotation and numbers of requests. Students will not be permitted to make their own arrangements for these rotations, as these will not be honored. Choosing an AOA -Approved Residency Selective Site CUSOM will not arrange stude nt's selectives, which are outside CUSOM's regional sites. If a student chooses to do one or two selectives at hospitals where AOA accredited post -graduate programs exist or at a military facility (HPSP students only), they must arrange those rotations th emselves with appropriate notification to Clinical Affairs . All paperwork for selectives must be completed and submitted during the approved selection time period 76 as noted by the Office of Clinical Affairs. All requests for selectives and elective rotati ons must be submitted not less than 90 days before the start of the rotation in order to be approved.

Retaliation against any individual who files a grievance or participates in the grievance process is prohibited. In the event a student or anyone who participated in the grievance process believes they have been subjected to retaliation, that individual may use the Harassment Grievance procedures list ed below. Step One: The Resolution Process Students who meet the technical standards and feel they are being discriminated against on the basis of race, ethnicity, color, sex, gender, religion, national origin, age or disabilities shall first meet with th e Executive Director for Student Affairs to explain their grievance. The student must schedule a meeting with the Executive Director for Student Affairs within two weeks from the date of the action being grieved or the date the student should have known about the action to initiate this discussion. The grievance complaint must be made in writing and signed by the person filing it. The Executive Director for Student Affairs shall investigate the grievance within a one -week period. In the case where the discrimination is in any way threatening, the Executive Director for Student Affairs shall investigate the complaint and bring it to the attention of the Dean immediately for intervention. After the investigation period of one week, the student filing the grievance and the person against whom the grievance is filed shall meet with the Executive Director for Student Affairs to discuss a peaceful and prompt resolution. This meeting shall be scheduled within 14 calendar days of the initial filing of the grievan ce. A letter confirming the mutual decisions of the resolution shall be distributed, within ten calendar days of the meeting, to all persons and kept within the permanent student and or employee files for possible future issues that may arise with the res olution. The Executive Director for Student Affairs shall keep a record of his investigation, including a report of his findings. All material shall be filed as previously stated in this procedure. Students who feel their disability5 needs are not being met may also file a grievance. In this case, the Executive Director for Student Affairs shall meet with the person filing the grievance. The Director shall complete the investigation of the complaint within two weeks. The student shall provide the Dire ctor with the verification of disability by a health professional and provide all suggestions for accommodations. The Director shall meet with the CUSOM officer in charge of the area where the accommodations need to be made to see if a peaceful and promp t resolution can be made. Where the peaceful and prompt resolution can be made, the Director will verify that the accommodation has been made and follow with written verification to all parties within that two-week timeframe. If the Executive Director for Student Affairs determines there is insufficient evidence to support the allegations, he may close the grievance and shall notify the student, within that two-week timeframe, of his findings and the student's right to request a grievance hearing. 4 Grievance procedures for sexual harassment are separate and can be found under the section: Sexual Harassment Complaints. 5 At the time of filing the student should have followed all the procedures listed in this Academic Bulletin. 117 The Execu tive Director for Student Affairs shall keep a record of his investigation, including a report of his findings. All material shall be filed as previously stated in this procedure. Step Tw o: The Grievance Hearing Process If the student feels they are bein g discriminated against or that their disability is not being adequately accommodated, and for whom a peaceful resolution has not been successful, they may request the Executive Director for Student Affairs and the Dean to call a Grievance Hearing. The stu dent has 30 calendar days after receiving written notice of denial of the grievance to request such a hearing. The request must be in writing, signed by the student, and inc lude the following information: A clear and precise statement of the grievance; State how the action is discriminatory or the decision unreasonable if it is a denial of a requested accommodation; Name the respondent parties (the person(s) against w hom the grievance is filed); State how each respondent is responsible for the action or dec ision; State the requested remedy; and State whether a non- participating observer will be brought to the hearing. This information must be sent by certified mail or delivered with signature of receipt to both offices. Upon receipt of the request for a Grie vance Hearing, the followi ng processes shall be followed. The Dean shall designate the Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Research to review the case within seven calendar days to see if a peaceful and prompt resolution can be made between the parties. In cases where this cannot be accomplished, the Dean shall appoint a Grievance Hearing Board at the end of the seven days. The Grievance Hearing Board shall be appointed by the Dean who shall notify the Grievance Hearing Board, in writing, of the ir appointment and inform them of the date of the hearing.

The Dean shall chair the Grievance Hearing Board and shall vote only in case of a tie. The Grievance Hearing Board shall hear the denial of accommodations grievance and/or the allegations of discrimination by the student. The person filing the grievance as well as the person against whom the grievance is alleged shall at this time bring all witnesses an d/or evidence to the hearing for the Grievance Hearing Board to consider. The Grievance Hearing Board shall also review documentation, including the final report from the Executive Director for Student Affairs relating to the grievance, and, as necessary, shall interview the Director as a witness in the grievance. Prior to convening the grievance hearing meeting, the Grievance Hearing Board shall be trained on the specific grievance hearing procedures relating to the individual grievance and will be provided with additional educa tional material as appropriate. Following this initial hearing and presentation, if additional information is needed to render a decision, the Grievance Hearing Board may recess for a period of not greater than two weeks .

Sexual activity is not permitte d in any CUSOM setting . See Code of Conduct in this Handbook for further information. Sexual Harassment Sexual harassment at the institution is unacceptable behavior and will not be tolerated. Sexual harassment includes sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other intimidating verbal or written communications or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Sexual conduct including, but not limited to, the following will be considered sexual harassment and will be regarded as a violation of this policy w hen such sexual conduct occurs between a student and employee, or between a faculty member and a student. This may also apply to situations between two students or among more students in which the harassment interfe res with the student's success: Submissi on to such conduct is made a term or condition of employment or student status. Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment or academic decisions such as retention, promotion, performance evaluation, pay adjustment, discipline, work assignment, or any other condition of employment, career development, or academic standing. Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with work performance or of creating an intimidating, hostile, or of fensive working or learning environment. Such conduct emphasizes the sexuality or sexual identity of the employee or student in a manner that prevents or impairs that person's full enjoyment of employment or educational benefits, climate, or opportunities. 119 If a student feels that they may have a complaint of sexual harassment, the following grievance process options are available: Students should discuss the matter with the Executive Director for Student Affairs . However, if a student is not comfortable meeting with the Executive Director for Student Affairs , he/she may meet with a CUSOM officer of their choice. If a complaint is filed in writing, the Execut ive Director for Student Affairs will ask the Dean to appoint the appropriate officers to investigate further. No one will receive unfavorable treatment for presenting a complaint of sexual harassment. However, institution policy considers reporting false information as behavior subject to disciplinary action. All complaints will be considered confidenti al to the extent possible. Only those individuals determined to be involved in the complaint or its resolution will have information concerning the complaint. Any individual violating the policy against sexual harassment may be subject to disciplinary action. Failure by anyone vested with the responsibility to report allegations of sexual harassment is considered a violation of this policy. It is the intent of this policy to comply with the requirements under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and Ti tle IX of the 1972 Education Amendments, as well as other applicable statutory laws and regulations of North Carolina. Responsibility for Sexual Harassment Concerns It is the responsibility of the Executive Director for Student Affairs to investigate claim s of sexual harassment in a timely manner according to established policies and with confidentiality to the extent possible. It is the responsibility of the administration and faculty to foster a learning environment that is free from sexual harassment. Sexual Harassment Grievance Process If a student believes that sexual harassment has occurred, they may receive confidential and informal consultation concerning the incident(s) without committing to a formal act of filing a complaint with subsequent investi gation and resolution of the incident. The student may request consultation with the Executive Director for Student Affairs . If the student is of a different gender than the Executive Director for Student Affairs , the student may request consultation wit h an administrator of the same gender if he/she so desires. Following the informal consultation, the student can then decide to: Counsel with the Executive Director for Student Affairs (or the other administrator) without taking formal action; Take person al action (such as a letter to the accused); Request informal third -party mediation; or File a grievance that initiates formal investigation and resolution of a complaint. The grievance must be in writing and must specifically identify the reason for the complaint. If a formal written grievance is submitted by a student regarding sexual harassment, an investigation will be conducted. If a reasonable probability exists based upon the information gathered, that harassment has occurred, the Executive Directo r for Student Affairs (or the other administrator) will: Develop and implement a plan for resolution acceptable to the accused and accuser, OR Hold a formal hearing. 120 Sexual Harassment Hearing Board If the student chooses a formal hearing to resolve an al leged complaint, the Dean will appoint the chair to conduct the proceedings.
