We have consequently been working hard to ensure a smooth service for all our PIs on both t hese fronts. We have had some queries regarding concurrent grant applications to various agencies. Our PIs now apply for funding from a whole host of agencies, each with its own policies and procedures regarding scientific overlap on grants. Read about th is important matter and how key agencies deal with it on page 3. The vast majority of our research funding comes from government sponsors, private charities and foundations. However, the corporate world too has some special opportunities of mutual interest . Read about this on page 4. Last but not the least, and as always, a compendium of forthcoming submission deadlines for research grants, public -\u00adprivate partnerships, public engagement, post -\u00addoctoral fellowships and more. With best wishes, Savita Lorem Ipsum Dolor Issue #, Date 2 Funding successes The following section provides brief details of our recent funding successes. We wish all the investigators well for their proposed programmes of research. Date 3 Extramural funds are awarded by agencies for discrete projects that are not already in receipt of funding from other extramural sources. There are different ways in which agencies scrutinize and enforce this. Here are some guidelines for submissions to some common agencies supporting our campus research. CSIR: At the point of grant submission, applicants are required to list all sources of research support availed / being availed/ applied for by the PI from different sources, including CSIR, during the last six years. DBT grants : At the point of grant submission, the Principal applicant, co -\u00adapplicants and the institutional head are required to sign a declaration that includes the clause \"the same project proposal has not been submitted to any other age ncy for financial support\". DST grants : At the point of grant submission, the Principal applicant are required to sign a declaration that includes the clause \"I/we did not submit the project proposal elsewhere for financial support\". Some Fellowships may be permissive for grant -\u00adholders to avail of the research support component while in receipt of salary support from alternative sources. WTDBT India Alliance: At the point of grant submission, the applicant is obliged to disclose to the Alliance any other grant proposals that have been submitted for support of the stated research project. The understanding is that should both applications for funding be successful, the applicant will activate only one unique source of funding. During the active period of t he grant, India Alliance Fellows are expected to check with the Alliance before applying for additional funding and are required to disclose receipt of any additional funding in their annual reports. The purpose of this is for the Fellow and the Alliance t o mutually confirm the lack of scientific overlap on both projects, the extent of time commitment for the new project and resolution of any IP -\u00adrelated issues. NSF: Requests that researchers alert it to the submission of identical proposals to different age ncies on an application cover -\u00adsheet, and that they use progress reports to inform it of changes in the grants they hold. NIH: The NIH prohibits any scientific overlap in the projects it funds. Some funding streams follow \"just -\u00adin-\u00adtime\" procedures where th e applicant is allowed to submit other support information post -\u00adreview . Grantees must also report any changes in other support as a part of the annual progress report. If you have any concerns regarding overlapping applications, please discuss this with RDO staff at any time during the grant submission process. Scientific overlap on grants Lorem Ipsum Dolor Issue #, Date 4 Microsoft Research funding The global IT giant Microsoft regards innovation as the lifeblood of its products and services and funds research for advancing the state of the art in computing through a combination of basi c and applied research. This work is furthered via in -\u00adhouse research at Microsoft labs, international collaborations with academic institutions and a range of fellowships and awards. Researchers at Microsoft look for ways in which information technology can help solve global challenges by developing new data analysis and visualization algorithms, by organizing data in new ways, by automating many of the tasks, and by building tools that streamline scientific workflows. They can partner with a group of dom ain scientists in academia and elsewhere to build new systems that demonstrate substantial advances. A brochure on some international collaborative research funded via Microsoft Research Connections is available with the RDO. Examples of Microsoft eScienc e initiatives can be accessed at http://research.microsoft.com/en -us/groups/escience/ and Microsoft Research Connections at http://research.microsoft.com/en -us/collaboration/stories/default.aspx If you have any queries regarding funding via M icrosoft Research Connections , please discuss this with RDO staff. Additionally, specific funding opportunities available to Indian students for projects with a computational science element via Microsoft Research India include: Microsoft Research India Travel Grants Eligible Indian students must be enrolled in computer science, electrical engineering, electrical/electronics communication engineering, mathematics, or a field that closely relates to computer science. Grant funds may be used towards covering the costs of attending conferences that are being held outside India.
