Often called the \"windows to the soul,\" our eyes can express more than just the nature of a person. Through the art and science of Iridology and Sclerology, the eyes give us many different indications as to what may be out of balance within our bodies and even what emotions we may be harboring! Our eyes are amaz- ing windows to the world around us, and we want to make sure that we are taking proper care of them! There are many issues that can go awry with our eyes. With overexposure to the blue screens from our cell phones, computer screens, and televisions, our eyes be- come strained and weakened. With the screens so close to our eyes, the muscles that we use to see things far away become underdeveloped and contribute to poor eye health. By regularly practicing eye exercises, we are able to build those underused muscles. There are many differ- ent types of exercises that can be found online to strengthen eye muscles. Other techniques that many people have used include gazing at the sun for a few seconds as it is rising each morning. When damage has been done to the eyes, there are op- tions to help relieve the pain. Ruta Graveolens is one of the top homeopathic remedies to help with the symptoms associated with eyestrain. When bruising occurs in the eye, look to Symphytum as an option for relief. When the eyes feel dry, try Euphrasia. The list of homeopathic rem- edies that benefit the eyes is extensive and would require more repertorising and research in order to pinpoint the correct remedy based on the description of the imbalance. Castor oil is another beneficial tool for eye health. This trick that involves using just a small amount of castor oil in the eyes at night can help to dissolve cataracts, remove impurities, moisten, protect against infections such as pink eye, relieve eye inflammation, as well as preventing dark circles and wrinkles! This amazing oil works wonders but will need to be done at night only. Colloidal silver can also be applied directly to the eyes to help clear up infection. It is suggested to use colloidal silver that is around 20 ppm (parts per million). Silver Shield by Nature's Sunshine is a safe and effective form of colloidal silver that can be dropped into the eyes. When eyes are inflamed, tired, or in pain, a convenient trick is to apply damp tea bags (whether warm or cool) to the eyes for 10 -15 minutes. The preferred tea used is Chamomile. This can also help the eyes to look more youthful! A quote by Benjamin Franklin that we have heard many times before, \"an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,\" is great health advice to live by. By eating balanced foods or taking specific supplements, we are better able to prevent any issues in various areas of health from ever developing. Some different vitamins, minerals, and amino acids to look for relating to eye health include the amino acid Taurine, the minerals fluorine, silicon, zinc, sodium, selenium, or Vitamins A, C, and E. There are many sup- plements offered by Nature's Sunshine to help bring bal- ance to the eyes like EW, Bilberry, and Perfect Eyes. With all of the different options available to help with eye health, it is best to see your local Naturopath to determine which option is best for you as the issue may actually lie in the liver! The eyes tend to be a reflection of the health of the liver as well as those harbored emotions. Someone who is well -trained in the art of natural medicine should be able to determine the root of the problem in order to bring balance to the source of the issue. \u0016 FACE IT: PART , KEEPING AN Tai Chi and medita- tion are great ways to help the body achieve balance to minimize stress! Here is a list of Products that Herbs etc carries that will help boost sex drive naturally! Nature's Sunshine \"Women's X -Action\" This blend of herbs really does live up to its name! This is an aphrodisiac blend of herbs that not only increases sex- ual desire in women, it also supports the female reproduc- tive system, nerves, adrenal glands and digestive system. Nature's Sunshine \"Men's X -Action Reloaded\" This formula is a combination of herbs and nutrients which enhance male ener- gy, activity and vitality. The herbs also support the male reproductive organs includ- ing prostate function. Since this formula increases circu- lation to the pelvic region, it may be helpful for erectile dysfunction, impotence, in- fertility and lack of desire. Nature's Sunshine \"DHEA -F\" (For Females) and \"DHEA-M\" (For Men) First of all, what the heck is DHEA, you ask? DHEA is a sex hormone that is mostly produced by your adrenal glands. It is a building block for the sex hormones testos- terone and estrogen. Supplementing with DHEA can de- crease stress, increase sex drive, overcome impotence in men and aid symptoms of menopause. This is a fantastic blend to use if you have adrenal burnout resulting in low sex drive! Life-flo \"Testro -Max\" Cream This natural testosterone boosting complex is designed specifically for men's needs.

Here is a small checklist to help get the body in tip top shape for the bedroom, or... wher- ever! \u00fe Ladies, get your thyroid checked out by your ND! Low thyroid affects sensuality and energy levels! Supple- menting with iodine and/or taking might do the trick! \u00fe Eliminate xenoestrogens! A subject that may be causing many issues with erectile dysfunction in men is Xenoes- trogens. These wreak some major havoc on testos- terone. Xenoestrogens are environmental toxins that mimic estrogen. They come from pesticides, soft plas- tics, and meat, eggs and dairy products where animals are fed estrogens to increase production. Even fluoride also depresses testosterone. This means if you are us- ing toothpaste that has sodium fluoride in it or drinking tap water, it could be contributing to low testosterone. The herbal blends listed below for men as well as Damiana, and Korean Ginseng will help restore testos- terone! Xenoestrogens disrupt the female glandular sys- tem, too! \u00fe Adrenal fatigue affects both men and women. Think of the adrenal glands as the batteries of the body. When you are burned out with adrenal fatigue, sex is usually the last thing you want to have. NSP \"Adrenal Support Formula\" as well as other adaptogenic herbs can help repair the adrenal glands and get the sex hormones to start working for you again! \u00fe Go on the \"Stop eating crap\" diet! Yes, I said it. There is no other way to plainly put it. This means cutting out processed foods, fast food, refined carbs, refined sugar and soda. ALL of these things cause havoc on mood, hormones, brain chemistry and catapult the body into a never ending toxic stress cycle which will inevitably af- fect your sex drive. Instead, eat organic fruits and vege- tables, healthy meat, follow your blood type and meta- bolic type diet, and drink PRETTY: HOW TO HAVE A HEALTHY MOUTH by Amy Jo Howard, ND Denise Denman spent her childhood years growing up on a small farm in Ionia County. She raised cattle for 4 -H, attended multiple extracurricular activities in school, and has always had a strong passion for helping people. After high school, she attended Michigan State University where she had planned to enter into Veterinary medicine. After years of dabbling into many different educational paths, she finally discovered her true calling in Natural Health. While finishing her education at Montcalm Com- munity College for a degree in Business Entrepreneur- ship, she began attending the first year program at the Naturopathic Institute of Therapies and Education. Denise has since continued her education at the Naturopathic Institute and has entered her fourth and final year of study before earning the title of Naturopathic Doctor. In addition to her academic studies, Denise has years of experience as a Reiki Master to help assist the healing process of others. Her small -town upbringing has influ- enced Denise to be a very down -to-earth, compassionate listener with the strong desire to assist others in obtaining wellness. She is currently seeing clients at Herbs Etc. for Natural Health Evaluations with a keen interest in fertility and pregnancy health, Colon Hydrotherapy sessions, and multiple different healing and bodywork sessions, such as Reflexology. For thousands of years in cultures all across the globe, people have enjoyed the therapeutic benefits of reflexolo- gy. Although it feels like a simple foot rub, reflexology is much more than that. This relaxing technique uses pres- sure on the various reflex points located on the feet to promote healing in all parts of the body. Each foot has over 7,200 nerve endings that connect to the organs and tissues located throughout the body! By stimulating these reflex points, those organs are directly affected. Our feet are abused on a daily basis from wearing those stylish yet uncomfortable shoes, carrying our own weight around, and from stepping on obstacles along our paths. Reflexology is a fantastic way to give those feet a break from the stress that is put on them daily. Sometimes, re- flexology therapists may include essential oils in the ses- sion, further benefiting the entire body. Experience this relaxing therapy for yourself by scheduling an appoint- ment with Denise; your feet will thank you! \u0019 MEET DENISE!
