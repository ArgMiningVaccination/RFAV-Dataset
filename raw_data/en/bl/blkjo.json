Our Physicians Have Been Featured In: The 6 Principles of Naturopathic Medicine Naturopathic medicine celebrates the healing power of nature. Naturopathic medicine is dedicated to the study and celebration of nature's healing powers. It is as old as healing itself and as new as today's medical breakthroughs. It is a dynamic philosophy as well as a profession that recognizes the interconnection and the interdependence of all living things. It utilizes the most natural, least invasive and least toxic therapies to treat illness and to promote wellness by viewing the body as an integrated whole ( [AANMC](https://aanmc.org/6-principles/)). Naturopathic medicine honors the body's innate wisdom to heal. Rather than being defined by methods or modalities, naturopathic medicine is defined by 6 principles. Naturopathic doctors practice these six fundamental principles of naturopathic medicine: The Healing Power of Nature Trust in the body's inherent wisdom to heal itself. Identify and Treat the Causes Look beyond the symptoms to the underlying cause. First Do No Harm Utilize the most natural, least invasive and least toxic therapies. Doctor as Teacher Educate patients in the steps to achieving and maintaining health. Treat the Whole Person View the body as an integrated whole in all its physical and spiritual dimensions..
