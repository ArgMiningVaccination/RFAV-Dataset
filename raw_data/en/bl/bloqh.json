A: Unless the reaction was an immediate allergic response within 4 hours that caused hives, lip/tongue swelling, trouble breathing, or anaphylaxis, the second dose is still recommended. If an immediate allergic reaction was identified after the 1st dose, the 2nd dose should NOT be administered. Q: What if I have had a severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine? A: For both Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna COVID -19 vaccines, severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vac cine is a contraindication to vaccination. Q: I'm on an immunosuppressant drug. Could this negate the effectiveness of the vaccine? A: It is possible that i mmunosup pression could result in a less effective immune response to the vaccine . We do not have eno ugh data yet to know for sure. However, anyone who is immuno compromised is at a higher risk for getting COVID -19 and for having more serious complications from the virus. The vaccine is not a live vaccine, so there is no chance of getting the virus from va ccination. Our MHC Infectious Disease experts encourage people who are immunocompromised to receive the vaccination, if they are able. Q: Can you get the vaccine while taking a medrol dose pack? A: There are no recommendations to avoid receiving the vaccin e while also taking methylprednisolone. However, if you are currently ill, it is necessary to wait until you are symptom free and can pass the entry screening. Q: I'm pregnant or breastfeeding. Is it safe to receive the vaccine? A: Pregnant and lactating women were not included in the COVID -19 vaccine trials, so there is currently no safety and efficacy data for this population. However, this is not unusual, as roughly 90% of FDA approved drugs are not studied in pregnant women, and experts look to the mec hanism of action to determine safety. The COVID -19 vaccine is not a live vaccine, which is important, as live vaccines are the only ones that are contraindicated for pregnancy. The CDC and their Advisory Committee on Immu nization Practices (ACIP) are in a greement with the Society of Maternal Fetal Medicine (SMFM) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) who recommend the vaccine not be withheld from pregnant and lactating women. It should also be noted that pregnant women are at a higher risk for COVID -19 infection. MHC experts recommend discussing this with your OB/GYN to evaluate individual risk vs. benefit . Updated: 1/15/2021 Q: What if I already had COVID -19? Should I still receive the vaccine? A: Regardless of your history of symptomatic COVID -19, you may still receive the vaccine. However, if you have recently recovered from COVID -19 (within last 90 days), it is safe to wait to get the vaccine until vaccine supply is more stable, if you would pref er. Q: Should I delay surgery if I have had the COVID -19 vaccine? Should I delay getting the vaccine if I have recently had surgery? A: There are currently no recommendations to delay surgery after receiv ing the vaccine or vice versa. However, i f you a c urrently ill with any symptoms, it is necessary to wait until you are fever free and can pass entry screening before receiving the vaccine. Q: How long do other vaccines (flu, pneumonia, etc.) need to be separated from an mRNA COVID -19 Vaccine? A: The COVID-19 vaccine series should be administered alone, with a minimum interval of 14 days before or after administration with any other vaccines. If mRNA COVID -19 vaccines are inadvertently administered within 14 days of another vaccine, doses do not need to be repeated for either vaccine. Q: Should we only get the first dose, to ensure more people have access to getting the vaccine? A: At this time, there is not enough evidence to support only getting one dose of the COVID -19 vaccine . Additionally, the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) was for two dose s of the vaccine, and we need to continue to follow those guidelines. Q: What about the new UK mutation ? Is the vaccine effective against this new variant? A: Currently, there is no evidence that the vaccin e would not also provide protection against this new variant. Studies are ongoing to provide us with more data, but mutations of the virus are extremely common and it is likely the vaccine will cover this one. Of note, experts have the ability to modify t he vaccine in the future if needed, but it has not been shown to be necessary at this time. Q: If a person has had Guillain -Barre Syndrome, should they get the vaccine? Is it safe? A: Per the CDC: \"Persons who have previously had GBS may receive an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine. To date, no cases of Guillain -Barre syndrome (GBS) have been reported following vaccination among participants in the mRNA COVID -19 vaccine clinical trials. With few exceptions, the independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) general best practice guidelines for immunization do not include a history of GBS as a precaution to vaccination with other vaccines.\" Source: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/vaccines/recommendations/underlying - conditions.html Q: What if Bell's palsy? Can I get the vaccine? A: Per the CDC: \" Cases of Bell's palsy were reported in participants in the mRNA COVID -19 vaccine clinical trials. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not consider these to be above the rate expected in the general population. They have not concluded these cases were caused by Updated: 1/15/2021 vaccination. Therefore, persons who have previously had Be ll's p alsy may receive an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine. \" Source: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/vaccines/recommendations/underlying - conditions .html Q: Now that we have been given the green light to vaccinate peopl e over 65 at high risk, can patients ask for the vaccine prior to discharge? A: MHC has been working exclusively on implementing outpatient drive -up clinics for tier 1b vaccination, and does not have a plan in place for inpatient COVID -19 vaccination, at this time. We would anticipate work to begin planning for this soon, but we do not know the timeline, currently. Q: Do I have to get the vaccine exactly 21 days out? Or is there a gra ce period? A: Per the CDC: \"second doses administered within a grace period of 4 days earlier than the recommended date for the second dose are still considered valid.\" Additionally, \"if the second dose is administered >3 weeks after the first Pfizer -BioNT ech vaccine dose or >1 month after the first Moderna vaccine dose, there is no need to restart the series.\" Source: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid -19/inf o-by-product/clinical -considerations.html Q: received the vaccine donate blood? A: Yes. Per the American Red Cross: \"There is no deferral time for eligible blood donors who are vaccinated with an inactivated or RNA based COVID -19 vaccine manufactured by Moderna --covid -19--and-blood - donation.html Q: have received the vaccine donate plasma? A: At this time, you cannot donate convalescent plasma after receiving any COVID -19 vaccine. "}
