And we are just now launching what will be a truly glorious renovation of the arts center. All this is, of course, thrilling to our students, faculty, ad- ministrators, and visitors. Our brilliant and dedicated facul- ty - and our very inspiring students - continue to dazzle the world with their groundbreaking research, pres- tigious awards, publications, and presentations.

The conference reviewed 100 years of largely fruitless efforts to resolve quantum mechan-ics' most troublesome enigmas since its founding a century ago. When the original keynote speaker, Nobel laure - ate Murray Gell-Mann (a leading fig- ure in quantum theory) died unexpect- edly several months ago, Dr. Hagelin was called to take his place - to reflect on Gell-Mann's groundbreaking work and to present his own work. Dr. Hagelin delivered a tour-de- force mathematical and visual presen- tation establishing that the unified field is fundamentally a field of con- sciousness. Building on that conclu- sion, he put forth an elegant solution to the mystery of the \"collapse of the wave function\" and its associated paradoxes like \"Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat\" (which, ac- cording to quantum mechanics, is both alive and dead). As part of his address, Dr. Hagelin detailed the sequential emergence of consciousness laid out in Maharishi's Apaurusheya Bhashya , which coincides in striking mathe - matical detail with the stage-by-stage emergence of the universe described by superstring theory.

Similar - ly, last year 101 new students enrolled in online programs and 94 on campus. \"The availability of online learn- ing brings the appeal of Conscious- ness-Based education to a much wid- er audience, and the year-over-year growth is an indication that our pro - grams are really resonating among pro - spective students,\" said Rod Eason, vice president of enrollment management and student life. The new online enrollment includes 49 undergraduate students in the BA in Ayurveda W ellness, a program that began in January. In addition, eight students enrolled in the new BA in Applied Arts and Sciences. T ogether, these 57 new undergraduate students compare to 50 new undergraduate stu- dents on campus. \"It's heartening to see that our new, online students are every bit as en- thusiastic about Consciousness-Based education as our on-campus students,\" said Chris Jones, dean of assessment and undergraduate studies. \"They have also bonded as an online community in a sweet and profound way. Online is definitely a growth area for the univer - sity at this time.\" Interest in online study of Maharishi AyurV eda and Integrative Medicine is even more robust at the graduate level, with 67 new students enrolling in this master of science degree, with a total enrollment of 163 students. \"This master's program has come along at just the right time, when the need for holistic, prevention-based health care has never been greater,\" Dr. Eason said. \"It aligns perfectly with MIU's mission to improve the quality of life everywhere.\" Overall, not counting students in the MS in computer science, the to - tal enrollment this fall is 760, with 353 online students and 407 on-cam- pus students.

While there has been a clinic on campus for many years that offered health consultations, beginning October 14 this ser - vice was greatly expanded to include Maharishi AyurV edic cleansing and detoxification treatments. The new clinic is located on the west side of Highway 1. A major impetus for establishing a full-service treatment fa - cility on campus has been the success of MIU's graduate and undergraduate programs in Maharishi AyurV eda and Inte - grative Medicine. As of this year, these programs enroll over 200 students and are continuing to expand exponentially. MIU is the first university in the US offering accredit- ed bachelor's and master's degrees in Maharishi AyurV eda, it now houses the first university-sponsored Maharishi AyurV edic clinic in the country.

Over 300 participants gathered on campus, and it was a mega-hit from start to finish. By popular request, a second reunion is in the planning stages for October 9 -11, 2020. Many guests had never been to Fair - field, and many more had not been here since the 1970s. Festivities began with a Friday night formal dinner. The Argiro Student Center's Festival Hall and the north dining hall of Annapurna were filled to capacity and the atmosphere became magical as everyone caught up and so - cialized with old friends. T ony Nader, university president John Hagelin, former presidents Dr. Bevan Morris and Dr. R.K. W allace, and others shared memories and insights from their time with Maharishi. Many guests had the opportunity, formally and informally, to share their own dearly-held stories of their experiences with Maharishi. An awards ceremony honored those who were made teachers of TM in Ri- shikesh, India, in the 1960s.Looking to the present and the fu- ture, guests also enjoyed sharing expe - riences with a panel of current young TM teachers - people in their 20s and 30s who have made the same profound commitment to teaching and preserving Maharishi's precious knowledge that the \"originals\" did 40 and 50 years ago. A major destination was Unity Gal- lery's exhibit of the newly established Maharishi Global Archives and Col- lections. On display were literature and memorabilia from Maharishi's multitude of initiatives around the world, now archived at MIU. Reunion of Original TM T eachers When asked what trans- pired over the 3 days, one participant summed it up: \"We laughed, got reconnect - ed with old friends, got our hearts warmed and uplifted, and generally had a spec - tacularly wonderful time! We loved every minute of it. Everything was spot on.

It explored the national epidemic of stress-related problems that can prove overwhelming for college students in their pursuit of higher education. The conference's goal was to showcase MIU as an institution of higher learning that is reversing this trend by putting stress-reducing meditation at the core of the curriculum, rather than as a pe - ripheral add-on as done at other uni- versities. A panel of five students discussed their experiences dealing with stress and the transformations they have under - gone at MIU. Speakers included neu- roscientists, psychologists, educators, and students.

The afternoon session, \"Becoming a Big Fish,\" took the form of a Shark T ank-like event, where five students pitched their business ideas in three minutes.

North Campus Village Phase Six 55 More T ownhouses North Campus Village has had five phases of construction, all of which have sold out quickly. Construction is currently underway for Phase 6 of the village community, with 55 additional townhouses planned. While Phase 5 had three homes per building, Phase 6 will have a mix of three- and five-unit buildings, some with one story, some with two. The new phase will feature a wide va - riety of options, with some of the town- houses having three or four bedrooms and a full basement at a base price of $231,500. The price of a one-bedroom, one-bath home will start at $82,500. The strong demand is due in part to people from around the country and the world wanting to move to Fairfield to be close to MIU. Many are teach- ers of the Transcendental Meditation technique who have spent time at the university in the past. \"This is their in- tentional community of choice,\" said developer Martin Brett. \"They want to live in this community of meditators and live in a home built according to Maharishi V astu design.\"This will be the final development in North Campus Village. Mr. Brett said any further low-cost developments will depend on whether the state continues to offer the incentives that make it fea - sible to build them.

Construction is currently underway for Phase 6 of the village community, with 55 additional townhouses planned. While Phase 5 had three homes per building, Phase 6 will have a mix of three- and five-unit buildings, some with one story, some with two. The new phase will feature a wide va - riety of options, with some of the town- houses having three or four bedrooms and a full basement at a base price of $231,500. The price of a one-bedroom, one-bath home will start at $82,500. The strong demand is due in part to people from around the country and the world wanting to move to Fairfield to be close to MIU. Many are teach- ers of the Transcendental Meditation technique who have spent time at the university in the past. \"This is their in- tentional community of choice,\" said developer Martin Brett. \"They want to live in this community of meditators and live in a home built according to Maharishi V astu design.\"This will be the final development in North Campus Village. Mr. Brett said any further low-cost developments will depend on whether the state continues to offer the incentives that make it fea - sible to build them.

By engaging in the act of transcendence, you have the crucial skill to transform, and will continue to transform, yourself as an individual.\" - Nakisha HobbsNavin Doshi, aerospace engineer, businessman, philanthro - pist, author, and scholar, received an honorary doctorate for his lifetime of peace-making philanthropic endeavors. Next to Dr. Doshi is his brilliant wife, Pratima - the inspiration for the newly funded Pratima Doshi Chair of AgroEcology in MIU's Regenerative and Organic Agriculture Program.Deepak Baskota received an honorary doctorate for his work in establishing a nationwide, cooperative movement in Nepal. He has given presentations on Transcendental Meditation to more than 40,000 people and has organized more than 5,000 students who now enjoy Transcendental Meditation in private and government schools. Chris and Laura Wege were awarded Doctor of World Peace honorary degrees for their lifetimes of public service and contri- butions to education. Nakisha Harris Hobbs is the co-founder and principal of the Village Leadership Academy in Chicago, with an innovative curriculum that includes the Transcendental Medita- tion technique. Ms. Hobbs is also associate director of the Office of Early Childhood Development in the Illinois Department of Human Services, where she oversees a $1.3 billion budget. Ms. Hobbs has redefined the purpose of urban education and im- plemented innovative components such as world studies and social justice curricula and the World Scholar Program. Nakisha Hobbs was awarded an honorary doctoral degree in education for her life - long service in addressing inequities in ed- ucation. On June 22, MIU graduated a record 592 students. Most of these students were from the US, Nepal, and Ethiopia. Of these graduates, 389 were from our Computer Professionals program and 55 students were from the Maharishi Invincibility Institute in Johannesburg, South Africa, where they received MIU BA degrees in business, and MBAs. The week leading up to graduation At MIU, the week leading up to gradu- ation day is incredibly rich and festive, and 2019 was no exception. T oward the beginning of that week, members of the Board of Trustees began arriv - ing from around the country and, in some cases, from around the world. Graduation Day falls on a Saturday, and the Trustees hold all-day meet- ings on W ednesday, Thursday, and Fri- day. These meetings culminate weeks of preparation because the Board of Trustees reviews the accomplishments of the whole university and its plans for the upcoming year.Celebratory events took place each of the three evenings. W ednesday night, the annual assessment and achievement awards were presented to selected faculty and administrators. It's always remarkable to see how much is accomplished in a short time at a rela - tively small school. Thursday night, Mr. Navin Doshi was presented with an honorary doc- torate in recognition of his outstand- ing lifetime achievements in aerospace engineering, business, economics, and philosophy, and for his philanthropic work in education, applying ancient wisdom to modern issues. Friday night, the night before grad- uation, is usually the annual Com-mencement Picnic, which offers an op - portunity for graduating students and their families to socialize with faculty in an informal setting. If it rains, as it did this year, that event is held indoors. Minus the al fresco experience, it was still a joyous, celebratory atmosphere filled with meeting and greeting among all sectors of our university. Following the picnic was the Student Awards Ceremony, where outstanding students in each undergraduate pro - gram were honored. At Commence - ment, honorary Doctorates of W orld Peace were presented to Laura and Chris W ege and to Deepak Baskota, for their lifetimes of dedication to pub - lic service and education.UNIVERSITY REPORT 2018-2019 | 11 10 | MAHARISHI INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITYFEATURES GRADUATION 2019 One of the best graduation weeks ever \"I just want to remind you that you have been equipped with everything that you need to be successful in this world.

FEATURES UNIVERSITY REPORT 2018-2019 | 19 18 | MAHARISHI INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITYDr. Fred Travis explains his recent important research on Consciousness-Based educationnot another piece of information that we've added to the field of education. It's \"knowingness,\" it's wakefulness it- self. Without this tool, CBE would just be another philosophy, another theory. When you know who you are, you have a stable basis for gaining knowl- edge. That is what is meant by our Consciousness-Based approach to ed- ucation. So Consciousness-Based education understands consciousness to be more than our changing, conscious experiences. Y es. In Consciousness-Based educa - tion, we understand that conscious experiences and cognitive tools are important. The student needs to learn facts and develop problem-solving and analysis skills. In addition, the silent , more expanded value of consciousness is available when students close the eyes and transcend. The student dis- covers that unbounded, unlocalized, pure wakefulness, consciousness, is their own fundamental nature and the basis of the world around them. The result is a delightful education- al environment! I love teaching here. W e arrive in class in the morning and everyone has already practiced TM. Everyone's feeling bright and clear, well-rested, eager to learn. W e focus on the discipline for 1 and 3/4 hours, then before the lunch break we meditate for 10 minutes. So, we're looking outside to explore the world, and then we're looking inside to explore the self. Back and forth, inward and outward. W e go to lunch, we come back, another two hours on the course material and finish with another 20-minute meditation.What exactly is your recent research on CBE? A study currently under review reports brain integration of 27 students who were measured as freshman and as se - niors. Over their time at MIU, their level of brain integration significantly increased. Higher brain integration is seen in high-level performers and is correlated with faster brain function- ing and greater creativity. In this study, we also measured the level of cognitive functioning. Over their time at MIU, these students de - creased in mood disturbances and in- creased in emotional-behavioral coping levels and self-esteem. This research is bringing out the practical value of Con - sciousness-Based education for making a real difference in students' lives. What do these findings mean? It means that colleges can teach you facts and figures, but also they should teach students how to be more alert, more wakeful, and more aware of things around them. In terms of an analogy, you can teach a novice cook how to prep vegetables, what angle to hold the knife, the best cutting board, the perfect lighting, and so on. But you also want to teach how to sharpen the knife. Then all of their actions will be easy and more successful. In terms of college education, MIU teaches students facts and skills, but MIU also teaches students the Tran- scendental Meditation practice to deal with stress and to be more awake and aware of their surroundings. On the outside, MIU looks like any other school. Students attend classes and professors teach the traditional disciplines. The difference here is that students have the ability to increase awareness itself. If you look closely, you'll notice our students are happier. It's a wonderful thing to be growing in consciousness. This just isn't the trend for the general population, especially at institutions of higher learning where mental health issues such as depres- sion, anxiety, eating disorders, and ad- dictions are at crisis levels. For the college years, how does Consciousness-Based education help students make positive, life-supporting choices? Consciousness-Based education is a game-changer. When you transcend you're stepping out of habitual pat - terns. Y ou're stepping out of habitual thoughts and feelings, stepping out of categories, stepping out of all mental activity, of all models of who you are. Y ou experience your essential nature. After TM practice, it's like coming back anew. Y ou look at all the old ha - bitual patterns in a different way, and so you have the ability to change and grow. Plus, regular transcending gives you more mental energy. Y ou have the mental get-up-and-go to consider a change. CBE allows you to have a dif- ferent picture of who you are, and then you have a different vision of where you want to go. And you have the mental energy to actually push that change through. So this is what you see at MIU. It's hard to quantify. It's subtle. I would say our students have more of a sense of direction; they're happy; they're ex- cited. They're not overwhelmed by the craziness of the world we live in. In- stead, they're excited about the possi- bilities of how things can be changed.ENLIVENING OUR W AKEFULNESS BRAIN CIRCUITRY Dr. Travis, to start out, please define Consciousness-Based education. Consciousness-Based education (CBE), fundamentally, is taking the parts of knowledge in a particular dis- cipline and connecting them so that they can be understood as one entity, one wholeness. And then connecting that wholeness to the innermost self of the student. So Consciousness-Based education takes the complexity of any field and structures its diverse parts into a wholeness that connects with the wholeness of the student. In short, it connects parts to their whole, and the whole to one's self. That is the essence of what we do in all our classes at MIU. How is all this \"connecting\" implemented? This connecting is accomplished on two levels: first, by using specific teach- ing techniques in the classroom and second, by adding the experience of transcending to the curriculum. A course-overview chart is created for every course. This chart presents the whole of the course, the themes of each week, and the topic of each day. At any time, students can see how what they are covering in class fits into the larger picture. A Unified Field Chart is also created for each course. This chart presents the structure of the discipline from more abstract to more expressed. Each lesson is placed in this larger whole. These and other charts train the student's attention to move from the point to the whole and back again. The second level of connecting part and whole in Consciousness-Based education is adding Transcendental Meditation to the curriculum. The students explore parts, then at the end of the day they close their eyes and ex- plore their innermost nature through TM practice. Transcendental Meditation adds a new type of experience. It's not an ex- perience of something - something that is seen or heard or touched or tasted or smelled. Rather, transcending is the experience of wakefulness itself, be -yond thinking, feeling, sensing, or eval - uating. The experience is of that part of us that is universal, not localized, expanded. CBE students experience their universal nature as part of the class experience. Every experience changes the brain. With regular TM practice, the wake - fulness circuitry that supports the ex- perience of transcending during TM practice begins to be self-sustaining and quietly permeates daily activity. Greater inner silence and stability al- lows us to better deal with the chal- lenges of daily life. With the technique of TM, we've added silence to education. Students can explore the nature of their self. It's The difference at MIU is that students have the ability to increase awareness itself. When you transcend, you experience your essential nature, pure awareness.CONSCIOUSNESS-BASED EDUCATIONFEATURES UNIVERSITY REPORT 2018-2019 | 19 18 | MAHARISHI INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITYDr. Fred Travis explains his recent important research on Consciousness-Based educationnot another piece of information that we've added to the field of education.

CBE allows you to have a dif- ferent picture of who you are, and then you have a different vision of where you want to go. And you have the mental energy to actually push that change through. So this is what you see at MIU. It's hard to quantify. It's subtle. I would say our students have more of a sense of direction; they're happy; they're ex- cited. They're not overwhelmed by the craziness of the world we live in. In- stead, they're excited about the possi- bilities of how things can be changed.ENLIVENING OUR W AKEFULNESS BRAIN CIRCUITRY Dr. Travis, to start out, please define Consciousness-Based education. Consciousness-Based education (CBE), fundamentally, is taking the parts of knowledge in a particular dis- cipline and connecting them so that they can be understood as one entity, one wholeness. And then connecting that wholeness to the innermost self of the student. So Consciousness-Based education takes the complexity of any field and structures its diverse parts into a wholeness that connects with the wholeness of the student. In short, it connects parts to their whole, and the whole to one's self. That is the essence of what we do in all our classes at MIU. How is all this \"connecting\" implemented? This connecting is accomplished on two levels: first, by using specific teach- ing techniques in the classroom and second, by adding the experience of transcending to the curriculum. A course-overview chart is created for every course. This chart presents the whole of the course, the themes of each week, and the topic of each day. At any time, students can see how what they are covering in class fits into the larger picture. A Unified Field Chart is also created for each course. This chart presents the structure of the discipline from more abstract to more expressed. Each lesson is placed in this larger whole. These and other charts train the student's attention to move from the point to the whole and back again. The second level of connecting part and whole in Consciousness-Based education is adding Transcendental Meditation to the curriculum. The students explore parts, then at the end of the day they close their eyes and ex- plore their innermost nature through TM practice. Transcendental Meditation adds a new type of experience. It's not an ex- perience of something - something that is seen or heard or touched or tasted or smelled. Rather, transcending is the experience of wakefulness itself, be -yond thinking, feeling, sensing, or eval - uating. The experience is of that part of us that is universal, not localized, expanded. CBE students experience their universal nature as part of the class experience. Every experience changes the brain. With regular TM practice, the wake - fulness circuitry that supports the ex- perience of transcending during TM practice begins to be self-sustaining and quietly permeates daily activity. Greater inner silence and stability al- lows us to better deal with the chal- lenges of daily life. With the technique of TM, we've added silence to education. Students can explore the nature of their self. It's The difference at MIU is that students have the ability to increase awareness itself. When you transcend, you experience your essential nature, pure awareness.CONSCIOUSNESS-BASED EDUCATIONUNIVERSITY REPORT 2018-2019 | 21 20 | MAHARISHI INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITYFEATURES GREAT STRIDES IN COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS PROGRAM GROWTH ComPro Dean Dr. Greg Guthrie and ComPro Director Elaine Guthrie A few years ago in Kampala, Uganda, two brothers told the Guthries they wanted to get degrees at MIU because two of their brothers had already studied here and gotten great jobs.

He discussed the Ayurvedic protocols for managing addiction as well as aspects of V edic counseling. \"People are look - ing for solutions to addiction, and it has become relevant to rediscover the an- cient Ayurvedic wisdom on this issue.\"Dr. Schneider, dean of the College of Integrative Medicine, noted that, \"Con- temporary medical practitioners tend to view Ayurveda in terms of body or physiology. That's only one third of the story. Original Ayurveda requires three pillars of health: mind, body, and envi- ronment, all grounded in the inner Self - Atma. \" Schneider presented an understand- ing of yoga in Ayurveda that empha - sizes union with one's inner Self. He said the Transcendental Meditation technique is a vehicle for achieving this union, as evidenced by scientific research on the health benefits of TM. Dr. Schneider also explained that modern medicine recognizes the tim- ing of disease onset and treatment in chronomedicine.

He discussed the Ayurvedic protocols for managing addiction as well as aspects of V edic counseling. \"People are look - ing for solutions to addiction, and it has become relevant to rediscover the an- cient Ayurvedic wisdom on this issue.\"Dr. Schneider, dean of the College of Integrative Medicine, noted that, \"Con- temporary medical practitioners tend to view Ayurveda in terms of body or physiology. That's only one third of the story. Original Ayurveda requires three pillars of health: mind, body, and envi- ronment, all grounded in the inner Self - Atma. \" Schneider presented an understand- ing of yoga in Ayurveda that empha - sizes union with one's inner Self. He said the Transcendental Meditation technique is a vehicle for achieving this union, as evidenced by scientific research on the health benefits of TM. Dr. Schneider also explained that modern medicine recognizes the tim- ing of disease onset and treatment in chronomedicine.

It is the first study to use an explanatory, mixed-methods, research design to explore the growth of social coherence using time-series analysis and qualita - tive-content analysis of news articles. The researchers analyzed monthly data on the level of socio-political violence obtained from automated content-analysis of news reports per - formed by a leading, independent, re - search organization. Statistically, the likelihood that the reversal of violence occurred randomly was one chance in 10 million. The positive effect of these pro - grams was predicted in advance of the group practice. Said Dr. Fergusson, \"Maharishi V edic University (MVU) was established in Cambodia in Jan- uary 1993 for the express purpose of bringing peace and prosperity to Cambodia. When the violence calmed down, the positive influence of the meditating groups was recognized by officials of the Cambodian govern- ment.\" The late King Norodom Siha - nouk publicly stated, \"MVU is play-ing an important role in restoration of peace and expansion of prosperity throughout our country.\" Reduction in violence began as soon as 550 students gathered to practice the Transcendental Meditation technique twice daily at Cambodia's Maharishi V edic University. By the following year, 100-200 students began practicing the TM-Sidhi program twice daily in a group.

UNIVERSITY REPORT 2018-2019 | 3334 | MAHARISHI INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITYACHIEVEMENTS - STUDENTS BUSINESS MANAGEMENT SUSTAINABLE LIVING Jessica Hernandez is Growing and Making Medicinal Foods and Getting Published Jessica came to MIU from San Antonio, T exas, because she was drawn to learning the Transcen- dental Meditation technique and liked the idea of studying one subject at a time with MIU's block system. She appreciated the integration of the TM technique into the daily routine. \"It's very valuable to sit in silence with other people,\" she said. \"It is powerful because it gives the physiology and the mind the chance to settle down and al- leviate some of the stress.\" As a teenager, Jessica developed a passion for growing healthy food and cooking. Eventually she decided to pursue those interests by studying sus- tainable living at MIU. T o get sufficient practice in organic farming, Jessica did internships at the MIU Student Farms greenhouse and a local business called Earth Wisdom. She also took a break from school to manage an almond orchard, work at a fermented food business, and take culinary classes at a community college in California. For her senior project, she re - searched the benefits of 10 common culinary herbs, including basil, cham- omile, lavender, and mint. Her paper describes the history and origin of each plant as well as their medicinal uses and lists the advantages of culti- vating these herbs in Iowa. Jessica feels confident about the knowledge and skills she gained at MIU. She is excited to build her own food business based on her experience in organic agriculture, culinary arts, and the healing properties of foods.

Peter Ocsody learned the Tran- scendental Meditation tech- nique in Hungary where he studied economics and engineering. He came to MIU in 1991, earned an MBA with an emphasis in organiza - tional development, and completed his coursework for his PhD in manage - ment. He went on to work for several tech- based companies and created his own startups. As a consultant he helped the development of startups and small businesses and produced workshops and courses for aspiring entrepreneurs. Over the past five years, Ocsody has built an entrepreneurial-accelerator program in Florida. Currently he is the Chief Strategy and Operations Officer at the Southwest Florida Community Foundation Collaboratory which helps develop the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the region. It provides resources and education to venture and social entre - preneurial organizations. In 2014 Ocsody completed an ad- vanced Project Management Program (PMP) certificate at Stanford Univer - sity, which inspired him to finish his PhD at MIU. He wanted to discover the inherent qualities that drive en- trepreneurs forward in the sequential genesis of multiple tech ventures. After interviewing 22 serial-tech entrepreneurs, he applied the ground-ed theory, research methodology, and various software to find shared char - acteristics which he distilled into four attributes: elastically nonconforming; abstracted serial monetizing; tech passioning; and heroed enterprising. According to his theory, habitual tech startup founders exhibit some mix of these four attributes. When searching for parallels be - tween Maharishi V edic Science and his research, he discovered pairs of opposite qualities coexisting harmoni - ously. \"Entrepreneurs need to balance opposites, and the better they are at it, the higher their chance of building a lasting enterprise,\" said Dr. Ocsody. \"That's what you do during the prac- tice of the TM technique. Y ou are more and more able to fluidly integrate opposites and create wholeness.\" From his own experience, he has found that practicing the TM tech- nique helps him maintain inner sta - bility. \"Entrepreneurship is highly un- predictable,\" he said. \"Y ou have to have a strong, internal, locus of control, which means that you define yourself by yourself. TM really helps with be - ing self-referral.\" The model Dr. Ocsody developed provides practical feedback to entre - preneurs about their strengths and weaknesses to determine what their focus should be. In addition, startup founders can learn in what domains they need supplementation via other entrepreneurs to create a viable enter - prise.Peter Ocsody Finishes Doctoral Thesis on Serial-T ech V enturing Peter Ocsody was one of MIU's five PhD graduates in 2019, and he received the Outstanding Student Award in business administration for his dissertation on the qualities of serial-tech startup founders.

Over the past five years, Ocsody has built an entrepreneurial-accelerator program in Florida. Currently he is the Chief Strategy and Operations Officer at the Southwest Florida Community Foundation Collaboratory which helps develop the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the region. It provides resources and education to venture and social entre - preneurial organizations. In 2014 Ocsody completed an ad- vanced Project Management Program (PMP) certificate at Stanford Univer - sity, which inspired him to finish his PhD at MIU. He wanted to discover the inherent qualities that drive en- trepreneurs forward in the sequential genesis of multiple tech ventures. After interviewing 22 serial-tech entrepreneurs, he applied the ground-ed theory, research methodology, and various software to find shared char - acteristics which he distilled into four attributes: elastically nonconforming; abstracted serial monetizing; tech passioning; and heroed enterprising. According to his theory, habitual tech startup founders exhibit some mix of these four attributes. When searching for parallels be - tween Maharishi V edic Science and his research, he discovered pairs of opposite qualities coexisting harmoni - ously. \"Entrepreneurs need to balance opposites, and the better they are at it, the higher their chance of building a lasting enterprise,\" said Dr. Ocsody. \"That's what you do during the prac- tice of the TM technique. Y ou are more and more able to fluidly integrate opposites and create wholeness.\" From his own experience, he has found that practicing the TM tech- nique helps him maintain inner sta - bility. \"Entrepreneurship is highly un- predictable,\" he said. \"Y ou have to have a strong, internal, locus of control, which means that you define yourself by yourself. TM really helps with be - ing self-referral.\" The model Dr. Ocsody developed provides practical feedback to entre - preneurs about their strengths and weaknesses to determine what their focus should be. In addition, startup founders can learn in what domains they need supplementation via other entrepreneurs to create a viable enter - prise.Peter Ocsody Finishes Doctoral Thesis on Serial-T ech V enturing Peter Ocsody was one of MIU's five PhD graduates in 2019, and he received the Outstanding Student Award in business administration for his dissertation on the qualities of serial-tech startup founders. After interviewing 22 serial-tech entrepre - neurs, Ocsody applied the grounded theory research methodology and various software to find shared character - istics among tech start - up founders, which he distilled into four attri- butes. UNIVERSITY REPORT 2018-2019 | 3536 | MAHARISHI INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITYACHIEVEMENTS - STUDENTS BUSINESS MANAGEMENT MBA T eam Performs in 94th Percentile in international business simulation According to Andrew Bargerstock, Se - nior Faculty in the MBA Program and Chair of the Accounting Department, who uses the Capstone Simulation in his Enterprise Performance Manage - ment course, MIU's MBA teams have participated in this online simulation since 2010. In all 20 events of MIU's participation (two per year), at least one MIU team has finished in the top 10th percentile. During the course, students learn about Maharishi's Five Qualities of the Executive Mind: comprehension, creativity, initiative, vigilance, and fore - sight. \"Students are asked to select two specific activities from the simulation for each quality and describe how those activities have cultivated each of the five qualities,\" said Dr. Bargerstock. \"Students report their findings in an essay, which is a valuable reflection of their growing maturity in decision- making.\" \"From this simulation, I learned that creativity is a key skill in business,\" said Haofang Dong. \" All the groups start on an equal footing. What you do to run the business will make a different story. All aspects of running a business need creativity.\" \"During the simulation I devel- oped my level of vigilance,\" said Mol- la Mekonnen. \" As a team member, I was watchful about the competitors' actions. Therefore, I was identify- ing our strengths and weaknesses in each round in each product segment and the opportunities and threats we would face in the coming rounds.\" Learning to work effectively in a team is also an essential skill the simu-lation cultivates. \"W e had to adopt cer - tain principles such as: respect for one another, focusing on ideas not people, and the principle of allowing data to lead the way,\" said Daniel Ayalew Be - lay. \"For example, the executive team members could come up with differing and, at times, conflicting decisions. W e were then required to reach a decision based upon consensus.\" Other high-performing universities in the top ten percent included Univer - sity of Northern Iowa, The University of T exas, Ohio University, University of W ashington, DePaul University, Brigham Y oung University, The Cita - del, Georgia Institute of T echnology, Royal Melbourne Institute of T ech - nology, and Shanghai University of Fi- nance and Economics.

Ayesha earned a bachelor's degree in psychology from Delhi University and a master's degree in organizational be - havior from Amity University, Guru- gram, Haryana, India. For her doctoral dissertation in management, she chose to focus on discovering the role of spirituality in the lives of empowered women in leadership roles and how it influences their work environment. She will be conducting case studies of women and will explore the con- cepts of workplace spirituality, servant leadership, and the idea of creating a nurturing work environment, where companies not only focus on profit maximization but also on individual personal growth. Her choice was largely influenced by her mother, Sunita Singh Sengupta, a distinguished professor and author who started the Integrating Spirituality and Organizational Leadership Foun- dation in India. Ayesha has helped her mother organize international confer - ences since she was in high school. It was also her mother who first brought Ayesha to MIU while she was a guest teacher on campus, and Ayesha be - came intrigued with the unique, stress- free, yet focused system of education. Another source of inspiration for her research came from the two years she worked as program officer for the nonprofit Amrita Serve, helping villages become self-reliant through organic farming and assisting women to become financially independent by selling their handicrafts. \"Growing up with my mother's leadership provided me the founda - tion that helped me see things in a cer -tain light of humility and compassion, which remain my core values,\" said Ayesha. \"But working at this organiza - tion truly broadened my perspective, seeing so many women unfold their potential. This is what truly helped me grow in so many ways.\" In addition to taking classes, Ayesha works as associate director of career services at MIU. She finds the prac- tice of the Transcendental Meditation technique beneficial in helping her maintain her focus and life balance. \"TM connects me to who I am and helps me stay present and grounded,\" she said. Ayesha is also volunteering with the Academy of Management to help pop - ularize their Management, Spirituali- ty, and Religion division and to en- courage MIU students to get involved.Ayesha Sengupta T akes First Place for dissertation, \"Spirituality and the Empowered Woman\" Professor Dennis Heaton with Ms. Ayesha Sengupta Ayesha Sengupta took first place in the Academy of Management's com- petition, \"Most Promising Dissertation Proposal in Management, Spirituality, and Religion.\" Ms. Sen- gupta received a $1,200 award to attend the annual meeting of the Academy of Management in Chicago, where she presented her proposal. Three student teams from MIU's MBA program participated in the 2019 spring Capstone online business simulation offered by Capsim Inc., a leading Chicago-based provider of business games.

They learn these principles through activities like cook- ing, art, exploring nature, stories, and songs. Through these enjoyable pur -suits they find that \"there is an inner aspect to everything\" and that all of life is interconnected. Montessori philosophy is the second pillar. Based on trust and respect for a child's inner eagerness to learn, this ap - proach provides a very specific and aes- thetically-beautiful set of works within the classroom to foster a wide variety of skills.

If you have not notified us that you have in- cluded MIU in your will or estate plan, please send an email to planned-giving@MIU.edu and we will be happy to include you in the honor roll as a member of the Legacy Society.Charitable gift annuity (CGA) A gift annuity is a simple contract between you and MIU. Y ou make a gift of cash or property, and you will receive fixed payments at regular intervals for one or two persons. A CGA can have immediate or deferred payments and may provide valuable tax benefits. Charitable remainder trust (CRT) A CRT will pay you either a variable or fixed dollar amount - depending on whether you choose a unitrust or annuity trust, respectively - each year for the rest of your life from assets you place in a trust. After your lifetime, the balance in the trust goes to MIU or other charities of your choice. Charitable lead trust This charitable trust pays income to one or more chari- ties, typically for a period of years, and then the remaining assets in the trust pass to non-charitable beneficiaries, such as family. Based on the circumstances, the type of property used, and the intended beneficiaries, lead trusts can have sig- nificant estate or gift-tax benefits. Other Tax-Smart Gift Ideas Bank accounts and CDs Are you aware that you can name MIU as the beneficiary of unused bank accounts (savings or checking) or on any certificates of deposit that remain upon your passing? Such assets can be designated to pass directly to the University without going through probate. Action step: Visit your bank and request to name a beneficiary on your accounts or CDs. Y ou can change beneficiary designations any time you wish. Savings bonds When you redeem savings bonds, you typically pay in- come tax on the deferred interest. If you never redeem them, either your estate or the person who inherits them will have to pay the tax. The best way to bypass the tax burden and make a charitable bequest is for you to add a codicil to your will or any amendment to your living trust that leaves your bonds to MIU. Retirement plan or IRA assets Because tax laws often subject retirement plan or IRA as- sets to the highest income tax when paid to your loved ones, leaving these assets to charity may be the most efficient es- tate-planning option. MIU can receive everything that is do - nated to it-tax free-from a retirement plan or IRA. Leaving these same assets to your loved ones, however, can expose the assets to income taxes at their ordinary income tax rate. Real estate Giving real estate allows you to make a significant gift with a tax-friendly outcome. Y ou can donate real estate in several ways: Give the appreciated property directly to MIU. This earns you an immediate tax deduction for its fair market value and eliminates the capital gains taxes when you've owned the real estate for more than one year. Make a gift of property through your will or living trust. Made as a part of your estate plan, a charitable bequest gives your estate an estate tax deduction and supports MIU long after you're gone. Donate your home but keep living in it. Through a \"re - tained life estate,\" you make a gift of your home while re - taining the right to use and occupy the property during your life. Y ou realize an immediate income tax deduction for a portion of your home's value. The information in this publication is not intended as le - gal or tax advice.

Donor support includes the annual fund, capital campaigns, and bequests and endowment donations. For the 2018-2019 fiscal year, student tuition and donor support comprised 88% of our total revenue. T otal donations were $5.43 million, including $2.25 million for the all- important annual fund.

For example, in 2019, Art Professor Jim Shrosbree, who received three W ege Foundation grants to support his work for the last three years, was honored with a Guggenheim Fellowship (see page 26-27). With W ege Foundation support, physics professor David Scharf attended the W orld Association for V edic Studies (W AVES) conference in Dallas with Dr. John Hagelin.

Highlights of the alumni reunion weekend included a Saturday lunch hosted on campus through the Alumni Office and a conference call with former Dean of Students Dennis Raimondi. Presentations from President Hagelin and Dr. Robert Keith Wallace were jocular and lively with reminiscing about the early days. They also gave updates on university accomplishments, pointing out how far the campus has come and the renown of our faculty in their respective disciplines. Other highlights included visiting the Maharishi Global Archives and Collections in Unity Gallery and socializing events held in several venues in town. By every account, a wonderful time was had by all. David Gottsch, class of 1980, from Tampa, Florida, commented, \"The reunion brought back many great memories and reminded me of the deep friendships I have from my years here. This weekend reunion was so fulfilling - we had such a good feeling together - that I wound up buying a condo in the North Campus Village so I can easily come and stay whenever I want. \" ALUMNI REUNION One hundred alumni from the classes of 1977, '78, and '79 gathered September 6 - 8 for a gala weekend reunion.DEVELOPMENT NEWSHighlights of the alumni reunion weekend included a Saturday lunch hosted on campus through the Alumni Office and a conference call with former Dean of Students Dennis Raimondi.
