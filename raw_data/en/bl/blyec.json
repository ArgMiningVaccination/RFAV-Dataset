Dogs are the main source of infection, contributing up to 99% of all rabies transmissions to humans. The virus usually attacks the brain causing several symptoms such as confusion, agitation, paralysis, and coma. Once symptoms start developing, the disease can be life threatening in the absence of prompt treatment. Fortunately, the onset of symptoms can be prevented by extensive washing of the wound with soap and water after a bite from a suspected rabid animal followed by timely administration of rabies immunoglobulin and rabies vaccines. The best way to avoid the transmission of rabies is by vaccination of dogs and preventing dog bites. Children should be adequately educated about rabies and protected from dogs. Pre - exposure vaccines are also recommended for the high risk people such as veterinarians, scientists working on rabies virus, and people working with wild animals. "}
