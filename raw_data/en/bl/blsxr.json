According to the Spine-Health website, it's \"the term used to describe the neck pain and damage sustained from looking down at your cell phone, tablet or other wireless devices too frequently and for too long.\" Headaches, neck pain, shoulder pain, pinched nerves and spinal degeneration are among the ailments people experience. Anita Stehmeier, P.T., an Ergonomic Program Therapist with Northwest Community Healthcare (NCH), says, \"At least 80 percent of the people I see have a forward head posture ranging from slight to severe.\" Children and teens are at risk because they tend to spend long periods of time texting friends and/or playing computer games while their spines are still developing. \"Holding your head at a 45-degree angle for an extended period of time creates stress on the spine, muscles, tendons and nerves, resulting in pain and pressure,\" says [Elizabeth Ziemann, M.D.](https://www.nch.org/doctors-specialists/physician-directory/detail/id/872), Medical Director of Medical Informatics and a Family Medicine Physician with NCH Medical Group. \"Parents need to limit the time their children spend on devices, and the general population can reduce the effects of text neck by holding devices straight in front of them.\" Positioning Ergonomic positioning can help prevent text neck-associated pain.

In addition, the [Text Neck Institute](http://text-neck.com/) recommends altering the angle of the head while texting. Holding a cell phone at an angle of 70 to 90 degrees from the floor can ease text neck symptoms. There are also mobile apps available, like the Text Neck Indicator LITE, which signals when a phone is being held at an acceptable angle. "}
