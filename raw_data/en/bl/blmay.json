The strategic priorities for UCI Health Affairs are bolstered by the strategic plans for each unit - all founded on the mission to Discover Teach Heal. Through the development of a shared mission and shared strategic priorities, the hea lthcare delivery system, the schools, and the research centers and institutes are committed to delivering innovations in clinical care, education and research (Future Health), producing equity and a diverse healthcare workforce to serve all communities with excellence (Health Equity), and to supporting wellness and treating disease optimally for individuals and communities (Precision Health). BACKGROUND As a comprehensive academic healthcare system, UCI Health Affairs is committed to offering the most ad vanced support for human health based on groundbreaking research, novel education, and delivery of cutting -edge care at the right time and in the best place. UCI's nation -leading status is being elevated by a uniquely collaborative strategic trajectory bui lt upon an alliance across the health disciplines of medicine, nursing, pharmaceutical sciences, public health, and integrative health, seamless consolidation within the health delivery system, and full engagement with the world -class expertise of UC Irvin e, notably, in the schools of computer science, engineering, biological science, physics, social ecology, law and business. UCI Health Affairs calls this collaborative approach ONE HEALTH : A first -of-its-kind, team - based alliance uniting health disciplin es that is further empowered by purposeful engagement with the entirety of the knowledge and resources of UCI. The shared goal is to predict, prevent, HEALTH SERVICES COMMITTEE -2- H2 February 16, 2022 and treat illness in a manner that is whole -person, patient -centered, and precise for individuals and com munities. ONE HEALTH is a vision and a philosophy for how to care for all people and populations with excellence. It is an aspiration to conduct research and share information for the good of the community and in the name of global health equity. It is a charge to bring to market innovative health solutions with industry and investor partnerships, and to contribute to the economic vitality of the region and the state. Most significantly, it is a way of life at UCI Health Affairs, and a model for the futur e success of academic health systems and the healthcare industry. Health Affairs Strategy ONE HEALTH is the vision that directs the Discover Teach Heal mission and empowers three strategic priorities, or pillars, that are shared across all Health Aff airs units for the next five years: Future Health: Innovations in Education and Research. UCI Health Affairs is focused on innovation from bench to bedside in education and research, focusing on arenas where UCI can distinctively push the boundaries to deliver data -driven, compassionate, precise, whole -person care for all people through: o Innovation in interprofessional education (IPE) to advance health care in first -of- its-kind team -based collaboration across health disciplines and the development of novel undergraduate programs leading to careers in allied health fields. o Innovation in basic , translational, and clinical research to make discoveries that advance precise care for individuals and communities. Health Equity. UCI Health Affairs is focused on producing equity and this demands that one identify, redress, and prevent health disparit ies, as one educates the diverse healthcare workforce of the future to serve effectively in all communities. Achieving this priority requires change in all three arms of the Discover Teach Heal mission. Precision Health. UCI Health Affairs is focused on creating care that is optimal for individuals and communities through the collection, analysis, and use of data in an ongoing manner with the highest level of attention to privacy and patient control of personal information. In this way, UCI can achieve the best outcome for each person, while advancing the quality of care for the next patient through continuously accrued knowledge. Over the next five years, the UCI Health Affairs footprint will grow through the construction of nine capital projects that have been approved by the Regents. The projects are on the main UCI campus, the medical center in Orange, and across Orange County. Construction is underway on the UCI Medical Center - Irvine (UCIMC -I), over one million squa re feet of new clinical space on the northern edge of the main UCI campus that will provide critically needed services for the surrounding community, and includes the Center for Advanced Care, the Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center and Ambulatory Care , and a 144- bed hospital with emergency HEALTH SERVICES COMMITTEE -3- H2 February 16, 2022 department. This new academic medical complex will improve access for patients living in coastal and south Orange County, and offer advanced specialty services in oncology, neurology, and neurological surgery, orthopedics, spine and digestive disease services, while drawing leading medical and research talent to UCI and creating jobs in the community. Also under construction on the main UCI campus, and just a mile from the new UCIMC -I in the UCI Health Sciences distr ict, is the five -story, 108,200- square -foot building for the Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences (COHS) and the adjoining four -story, 71,500 -square - foot Sue & Bill Gross Nursing and Health Science Hall (N&HSH); these will be completed in the summer of 2022 and followed in Q1 of 2023 by a 2,000 -stall parking structure ( 663,000 sq ft). The COHS and N&HSH will house faculty, teaching venues, and research space, as well as the administration for the Sue & Bill Gross School of Nursing, the Program i n Public Health, the Susan Samueli Integrative Health Institute, the COHS, and the Dean's suite for the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. In addition, these two buildings include shared spaces for all units of the COHS, including the School of Medicine, providing ten new classrooms, a 200-seat auditorium, and interprofessional education space featuring a state -of-the-art clinical skills laboratory and simulation center. UCI Health Affairs' research footprint will also expand in the district with the 200,000- square -foot Falling Leaves Foundation Medical Innovation Building, which will house wet laboratory research programs that bridge health disciplines. The building is slated to open in 2023. UCI Centers and Institutes of Health The collabor ative ethos of UCI and the ONE HEALTH model are manifest in the Health Affairs centers and institutes that operate on an inclusive UCI -wide basis. The UCI Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (CFCCC) is entering its 28th year as a National Cancer Institute (NCI) -designated comprehensive cancer center, the only one based in Orange County and one of 51 in the nation. NCI designation and funding were competitively renewed in 2021 for a five -year period. T he CFCCC's tripartite mission parallels that of UCI Health Affairs, to Discover, Teach, and Heal, within the broad discipline of cancer medicine. Specifically, the CFCCC aims to: i) promote transdisciplinary research across UCI to develop new knowledge about cancer prevention, treatment, and survivorship that will shift scientific paradigms and change public policy and clinical practice; ii) disseminate cancer knowledge to health professionals, patients, and the public; and iii) deliver the highest -quality care to cancer patients while alleviating the burden of cancer on its catchment area of Orange County. Since its last NCI renewal in 2015, the CFCCC has grown substantially in membership (35 percent), extramural funding (30 percent), publications (11 perce nt), new cancer patients seen (73 percent), and accrual of patients to interventional clinical trials (264 percent). Also, new clinical and research programs were launched, including in cancer metabolism, cancer screening and prevention, cancer imaging, an d hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Future CFCCC efforts are guided by the new 2020- 25 CFCCC Strategic Plan, which is aligned with the UCI Health Affairs Strategic Pillars of Health Equity, Precision Health, HEALTH SERVICES COMMITTEE -4- H2 February 16, 2022 and Future Health. These goals i nclude growing the HSCT program and the associated cellular and immune therapy component; launching new cancer imaging and imaging - enabled therapeutic technologies; establishing a formal Precision Oncology Program and Molecular Tumor Board; promoting the t ranslation of discoveries of UCI scientists, particularly those in cancer metabolism, towards the clinic; expanding UCI cancer screening and prevention program to additional Federally Qualified Health Centers in Orange County; and recruiting additional cancer -focused clinical and clinical investigator faculty to meet the demands of the new cancer care and research facilities currently under construction on the UCI main campus in Irvine, and better position the CFCCC to compete with other academic cancer cen ters in Orange County. All of these areas will be facilitated by the CFCCC's membership in the UC Cancer Consortium, a clinical and research collaborative of NCI cancer centers drawn from the campuses of UCLA, UCSF, UC Davis, UCSD, and UCI. The UCI Sue & Bill Gross Stem Cell Research Center (SCRC) is a dynamic array of interdisciplinary investigators from the Schools of Medicine, Biological Sciences, Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Engineering, Arts, and Law. The SCRC state- of- the-art, LEED Platinum- certified research and clinical building in the UCI health district houses 26 of 63 center faculty. The faculty have obtained more than $250 million dollars in grant and foundation funds (including over $125 million dollars from the California Institute fo r Regenerative Medicine) and are internationally recognized in the arena for neuroscience. In addition to basic science wet laboratory facilities, the SCRC includes first-floor clinical space for which renovations have just been completed to add a four - bed infusion center and clinical examination room to support expansion of operations for the CIRM Alpha Stem Cell Clinic (ASCC). The ASCC supports phase one to three clinical trials in stem cell and regenerative medicine, with a current portfolio that include s diabetes, burns, glioblastoma, neurological disease, and vision disease. SCRC programs include NIH -sponsored T32 training grants, a CIRM training grant, state -of-the-art shared equipment and research services cores, community lecture series, an annual st em cell science symposium, and numerous seminar series. The UCI Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) is funded by the National Institutes of Health under the Clinical and Translational Sciences Award (CTSA) program. The ICTS successfully competed for CTSA renewal in 2021. The ICTS functions as a local centerpiece for the national program, which includes ~ 50 leading U.S. medical research institutions and is dedicated to advancing scientific discovery and education. A major goa l of the ICTS is to partner with the 3.5 million people in UCI's diverse communities and serve as a laboratory for translational science - integrating data and evaluation to develop, demonstrate, and disseminate novel research tools that can palpably advan ce health in Orange County, across the country, and throughout the world. The broad reach of the ICTS is apparent in the statistic that approximately 45 percent of NIH funds at UCI are generated by ICTS -affiliated faculty and that the institute has funded 87 pilot faculty community projects since 2015. The ICTS is one of 11 sites in California for the Community Engagement Alliance (CEAL) that has addressed recruitment of underserved populations into clinical trials during COVID -19, countering misinformation , understanding and reducing vaccination hesitancy, and facilitating HEALTH SERVICES COMMITTEE -5- H2 February 16, 2022 vaccination. Additionally, through collaboration with the UCI Program in Public Health, the ICTS was awarded support for the Public Health Informatics and Technology (PHIT) Workforce Deve lopment Program, which will graduate 300 students over the four -year funding period as part of a nationwide effort led by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC). The UCI Center for Clinical Research (CCR) is a full -service clinical research organization providing life -saving clinical trials by strengthening and accelerating the pathway of discovery from bench to bedside. CCR's trials cover the full spectrum of conditions, including heart disease, neurological disorde rs, visual impairment, and more. UCI trials have increased by more than 36 percent in each of the last two years, with over 800 currently led by 215 principal investigators, representing $100 million in obligated costs. In fall 2021, UCI Health became a founding member of the Advancing Clinical Trials at the Point of Care (ACT@POC) coalition, a nationwide effort to provide accessible, cost -effective and inclusive clinical trials towards answering priority research questions on cancer; prepare for future public health emergencies; and address common diseases where there is long -standing unmet medical need, including cardiovascular and neurological diseases. Launched in 2021, the UCI Institute for Precision Health (IPH) is a campus -wide collaboration providin g a platform for cross -disciplinary teams dedicated to research and innovation on the complex challenges of health and health care. Utilizing the power of UCI's deep clinical expertise integrated with the fields of data science, multi -omics, artificial intelligence, and bioinformatics, IPH is providing a robust platform for access to all types of health data and a collaborative, multi -institutional team- science environment. IPH applications are driving a new, more equitable era for health and well -being, in part, through key industry, community, and NGO partnerships. UCI IPH's goal is to transform the understanding of disease, personalized care, and whole -person well -being. Improvement in patient care and health consumer advocacy will be the preeminent measu rable outcomes for IPH success. Early priority areas include developing clinical tools for clinicians and patients, using machine learning to identify disease markers to develop patient -specific therapies, using genomics to identify undefined disorders, establishing a broad and ethical patient consent process, and training the next generation of health -directed science and medical leaders. IPH continues to provide critical support during the coronavirus crisis using electronic patient data to create predict ive models that estimate disease progression, responses to monoclonal antibody therapies, hospital census and staffing capacity, and identify individuals who require escalated care as well as understand genetic susceptibility to severe disease. School of Medicine UCI School of Medicine (SOM) advances high- impact medical research, educates a diverse health workforce, and delivers evidence -based, patient -centered health care in pursuit of the Discover Teach Heal mission. HEALTH SERVICES COMMITTEE -6- H2 February 16, 2022 Research strength has continu ed to climb. For FY 2020- 21, the SOM was awarded nearly $285 million in research funding, an all -time high for the School, and a 46 percent increase over the last five years, with basic science and clinical trial research accounting for the lion's share. Initiatives are currently underway to achieve even higher levels of research distinction, including increasing the number of federal awards for faculty and training grants, expanding physician participation in research activities, and growing the physician -scientist pipeline. The SOM's initiative to grow the physician -scientist pipeline will contribute to replenishing the loss of these important contributors who link basic discovery to improve healthcare and whose numbers have declined from 4.7 percent to 1.5 percent of the physician workforce nationally over the last 30 years, a 68 percent decline. 1 On the academic side, the SOM educates more than 400 medical students and trains more than 700 residents and fellows at UCI Medical Center and affiliated institutions. The SOM also embraces an active community of diverse scholars, made up of approximately 130 Ph.D. and master's students, dedicated to excellence in original research, teaching, creative expression, and intellectual leadership. Recent developments will enable expansion of the medical student class size from 104 to 114, which marks the first ex pansion in over 15 years. The SOM is also advancing a new Engineering to Medicine degree program, which is anticipated to accept applications in the fall. Related to the teaching mission, over the next five years, the SOM is focused on implementing novel instructional strategies to integrate basic science education with workplace experiential learning, and advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion across UCI's health enterprise. Already, the SOM has launched a clinical boot camp and developed basic scien ce-focused clinical experiences and strengthened diversity efforts with the appointment of a Diversity Officer, creation of a designated Belonging, Equity and Empowerment (BEE) unit and the addition of four faculty equity advisors. However, diversity is not a new point of interest for the School. More than 18 years ago, the SOM launched the Program in Medical Education for the Latino Community (PRIME -LC), which has continued to thrive. In more recent years, two additional mission- based programs were intro duced, the Health Education to Advance Leaders in Integrative Medicine (HEAL -IM) and the Leadership Education to Advance Diversity - African, Black and Caribbean program (LEAD -ABC), which recently captured the attention of a sister school, UC Riverside. Through the PRIME -LC and LEAD -ABC programs, the number of gifted underrepresented in medicine (URM) students now far exceeds national averages. Lastly, to support clinical initiatives, the SOM maintains research, clinical and teaching relationships with the VA Long Beach Healthcare System and Children's Hospital of Orange County (CHOC). In seeking clinical excellence, the SOM continuo usly strives to improve patient experience ratings, and remains focused on expanding service lines and enhancing patient access. 1https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmp1904482 HEALTH SERVICES COMMITTEE -7- H2 February 16, 2022 Sue & Bill Gross School of Nursing The Sue & Bill Gross School of Nursing (SON) is committed to improving society today a nd tomorrow through research, scholarship, education, and practice. The SON's strategic direction for the next five years builds on this commitment across its tripartite mission to transform the nursing profession by preparing pioneers in research, educati on, and practice to build innovative, interprofessional models of compassionate community -based health care. In research and scholarship, the SON will build on its foundation of federally supported research projects to address pandemic preparedness, through its already robust infectious disease research; health equity, through its established programs in data science and informatics and its Center for Nursing Philosophy, which addresses health- and-society dilemmas and is the only such center in the U.S.; and climate change and health, a new initiative for the SON, by seeking to partner with UCI Health to implement the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) recommendations on climate -resilient and low -carbon health systems. The strength of SON's research continues with $4 million in annual National Institute of Health research awards, placing it within the top 20 percent of nursing schools. Research capabilities will be enhanced by establishing an office of nursing research, hiring an associate dean, and a full -time research director. The SON educates aspiring nurse leaders for California, the country, and the world who serve all members of society, with special emphasis on the vulnerable. This will be enhanced by launching an office of community engagem ent and by developing an interdisciplinary graduate degree program to prepare graduates to address the social determinants of health for diverse communities in California. Clinical practice remains at the heart of the SON mission. Over the last five years, the SON faculty practice achieved 50 percent growth and the SON will work to expand and resource its academic practice partnership with UCI Health to include collaboration with the SON's faculty practice. The SON will place renewed emphasis on diversity , equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB). It will seek to increase representation among its faculty and students, and it will emphasize DEIB across its tripartite mission by focusing research and scholarship on societal issues that affect Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (pandemic preparedness, health equity, and climate change); integrating DEIB throughout its programming, admissions, and hiring; and extending its clinical outreach into underserved communities. Additionally, the SON aims to expand t he faculty practice into at least one high -need population within Orange County and surrounding counties. School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences The new UCI School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences (SPPS) aims to be an emerging leader in transformational advances in team -based pharmacy practice, research, and education. The SPPS spans a continuum from discovery, development, and delivery of new drugs, devices, and diagnostics all the way to optimizing medication therapy in patients and pa tient populations. The COHS's mission - Discover Teach Heal - is the foundation of the SPPS's strategic priorities. In the area of discovery, the SPPS is leveraging interdisciplinary drug discovery HEALTH SERVICES COMMITTEE -8- H2 February 16, 2022 technologies and expanding work in diagnostics and de vices for improving patient health outcomes in areas such as oncology, neuroscience, emerging infectious diseases, and psychiatry. Establishing core facilities for bio -analytics and collaborative institutes within neurotherapeutics, health span sciences, and mRNA research are key SPPS -driven initiatives fostering research success across disciplines. Over the course of the pandemic, the SPPS developed a low -cost, accurate, COVID -19 antibody detection platform and advanced innovations in vaccine development. Regarding teaching, the SPPS has a goal to train the next generation of creative, problem -solving leaders in pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences. The launch of the new Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) program allows for the creation of a four -year curriculum with intentional placement of interprofessional education courses and activities across the COHS, including pharmacy, medical, nursing, and public health students. The education mission extends to patients and community members to educate about safe, effec tive uses of prescription, over -the-counter, and complementary medications, and healthy aging strategies. Across its four academic programs - B.S., M.S., Ph.D. and Pharm.D. - the SPPS aims to increase diversity of practicing pharmacists and pharmaceutical scientists, with the inaugural Pharm.D. cohort comprising 56 percent first -generation college students and 29 percent underrepresented students. Recruitment efforts are critical as the SPPS aims to close the gap to represent more closely the URM demograph ics within Orange County and California. The SPPS faculty strive to heal by improving patient health outcomes either through their research programs, educational outreach, or clinical practices. At the core of the commitment to clinical service, the SPPS actively promotes health equity, addresses health disparities in pharmacy deserts, optimizes medication therapies and outcomes, and creates team -based, cost - effective, collaborative care models that advance patient care, disease prevention, and health prom otion. Close collaboration and strategic planning with the UCI Health Department of Pharmacy ensures the growth of the SPPS and supports the health system goals, advancing clinical pharmacy services within the UCI health system. Program in Public Health In the past two years, the Program in Public Health (PPH) has experienced significant growth, expanding from a single Department of Population Health to a program with four departments: the Departments of Environmental and Occupational Health; Epidemiology and Biostatistics; Health, Society and Behavior; and Population Health and Disease Prevention. The PPH is currently working with the UCI Division of the Academic Senate on a proposal to become the UCI School of Population and Public Health, making it the fourth school of public health in the UC system. Solidifying its role as a regional leader in public health, the PPH held important leadership roles in designing and implementing COVID -19 response across the campus and Orange County. HEALTH SERVICES COMMITTEE -9- H2 February 16, 2022 Researchers conducted numerous large -scale, population- based studies, which examined relationships between biological, social, and environmental determinants of health. With the growth of the PPH, three new faculty members were hired in 2021 and another six new hires will be completed in Q1 and Q2 of 2022. The PPH maintains a commitment to recruit faculty who reflect California's rich ethnic and cultural diversity and who are committed to transdisciplinary research. These new faculty, and future hires, will continue to off er advanced training to highly qualified degree candidates. As a result of UCI's Black Thriving Initiative Faculty Cluster Hiring Program, the PPH launched the Center for Environmental Health Disparities Research and will also hire two additional faculty members through the program. The PPH approaches training with the principles and methods used to study the distribution and determinants of disease in human populations such as diabetes, obesity, and other metabolic diseases; cardiovascular disease, cancer, age- related diseases, and cognition; emerging and infectious diseases; as well as the environmental, social, dietary, and genetic determinants of health and health disparities. The PPH also has key leadership roles in a workforce development progra m to train nearly 450 professionals in public health informatics and technology over the next four years. The PPH's research endeavors range from the molecular level to the population level and utilize state-of-the-art technologies and big data to elucid ate relationships between exposures to environmental contaminants and other environmental factors and biochemical, psychosocial, physiological, and pathological changes in diverse populations. The PPH also created the Office of Public Health Research and a ppointed its inaugural Associate Dean of Research and is developing new areas of excellence, including Nutrition, Public Health Informatics, Bioethics, and Health Service Research. The PPH is committed to promoting health equity locally and globally thro ugh its research, practice, and training. The PPH is preparing the next generation of public health leaders to enter the workforce equipped with the skills and expertise needed to address disparities through evidence -based science. Susan Samueli Integrati ve Health Institute The Susan Samueli Integrative Health Institute (SSIHI) prioritizes optimal health and well- being of patients, colleagues, communities, and populations by incorporating evidence -informed integrative health into translational research, e ducation, clinical services, and community programs. Within each of these areas, the SSIHI is expanding and pioneering new and future strategic initiatives that support the research, education, and practice of evidence -based integrative health in all settings of care. The SSIHI continues to build a robust integrative research program to advance the discovery of the scientific basis of integrative health approaches. Fifteen endowed chairs, whose mission will be to explore areas of integrative health, will be embedded with the health sciences schools. Current recruitments for the endowed chairs include two in the School of Medicine and one in the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. Separately, the Samueli Scholars Award HEALTH SERVICES COMMITTEE -10- H2 February 16, 2022 Program recognizes current UCI faculty whose achievements show extraordinary promise to advance basic, translational, or clinical scholarship in integrative health and have a history of contributions of national distinction in their disciplines. Six interdisciplinary scholars were named in the inaugural class in fall 2021, following a campus -wide call for nominations. In tandem, efforts within the SSIHI related to education are promoting academic rigor and interprofessional collaborations among the COHS schools and programs, launching programs that span from primary care in the community to specialty services in the hos pital, notably, in oncology, cardiology, and neurology/neurosurgery. Within the School of Medicine, Health Education to Advance Leaders in Integrative Medicine (HEAL -IM) and Culinary Medicine programs are premiere examples of these efforts providing medica l students with an integrative health curriculum education focused on team -based care. From a clinical perspective, the SSIHI provides comprehensive whole -person health care and disease prevention to the community. The SSIHI launched the Integrative Nurs ing Initiative, the first national program to have trained over 91 percent of existing nurses at UCI Health in the principles and practices of integrative nursing care. This initiative showcased to UCI Health nurses and patients the value and importance of collaborative integration of team- based care and utilization of integrative modalities to improve symptom management, increase utilization of non-pharmaceutical approaches to pain control, and enhance patient experience. In support of employees during the pandemic, the SSIHI provided free access to evidence -based theories and practices through a Wellbeing Initiative for UCI employees. The Wellbeing Initiative sessions were expanded to all UC campuses and included topics focused on mindfulness, wellness education, guided acupressure, massage, nutrition, and biofeedback. The SSSIHI is leading healthcare transformation through integrative health by addressing the root causes of disease, lifestyle modification, and patient empowerment. Through partnerships with the UCI Health System and the community, the Samueli Institute is trailblazing whole person and community integrative care. Health System Strategy Established in 1976 after the acquisition of the Orange County Medical Center, UCI Health is a unique contributor to the well -being of the community as the only health system dedicated to caring for the most acute and sickest patients in the region as well as the underserved. UCI Health provides a full scope of high- quality patient care services to the community and attracts a broad and diverse patient population which is also served by the education and research programs of the UCI School of Medicine. UCI Health remains committed to ensuring the safety of patients and is proud to have received its 15th consecutive \"A\" in the fall 2021 Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade. Additionally, UCI Health's continued commitment to nursing excellence has earned it a fourth designation as a Magnet -recognized hospital. For the 21st consecutive year, U.S. News & World Report has recognized UCI Medical Center - Orange (UCIMC -O) as one of America's Best Hospitals. These accreditations and recognitions reflect UCI Health's effort s to achieve the highest standards of care for its community. HEALTH SERVICES COMMITTEE -11- H2 February 16, 2022 Orange County's only academic medical center, UCIMC -O serves as the primary tertiary and quaternary care referral center for nearly four million people residing in and around Orange County, western Riverside County, and southeastern Los Angeles County. It is also Orange County's only combined Level I Trauma Center and Level II Pediatric Trauma Center verified by the American College of Surgeons, with combined high- risk obstetrics and regiona l neonatal programs, and an American Burn Association- verified Regional Burn Center. The UCIMC -O campus is home to Orange County's only National Cancer Institute -designated comprehensive cancer center. As an NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center, UCI Health provides access to leading edge care and clinical research not available at other hospitals and health systems in the county. UCI Health has two Family Health Centers with locations in Santa Ana and Anaheim, both of which are Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs); the latter is the oldest in Orange County. Wholly owned and operated by UCI Health, in collaboration with experts from the UCI School of Medicine and Sue & Bill Gross School of Nursing, the Family Health Centers strive to improve the health and w ell-being of patients by providing high- quality, accessible, integrative, and comprehensive care to every member of the family. UCI Health's mission of Discover Teach Heal is supported by its vision to be the best place to give and get care. To dr ive that vision, UCI Health has made a commitment to empower and engage to create a diverse, equitable, an d inclusive environment for its co -workers and those it serves. As UCI Health operates in a very competitive marketplace, it strives to be the employe r of choice and believes in the importance of cultivating a work environment in which all co- workers feel a sense of belonging and empowerment to lead the changes that are needed by patients and community. UCI Health's plan to achieve its mission, vis ion, and commitment is focused on three key priorities: 1) Improve Health - UCI Health is committed to improving patient outcomes and prioritizing patient experience, convenience, and access. Within this objective, UCI Health will: Develop and impl ement best -in-class care processes and systems that enable the achievement of new levels of performance in quality, safety, and efficiency Ensure convenient access to primary and specialty services, including physical and virtual options Partner wi th patients and communities to empower them to play an active role in accountability for their health and wellness Despite the global pandemic, UCI Health has remained focused and implemented numerous strategies, as planned, to improve access over the past several years with an expansion of its ambulatory network throughout the community. With the opening of six additional strategic locations in the last three years, local residents can access both primary and specialty services closer to where they li ve and work, with additional sites in various stages of development. In addition, the deployment of digital health strategies and optimization of scheduling have HEALTH SERVICES COMMITTEE -12- H2 February 16, 2022 significantly improved the timeliness of appointment availability with UCI Health's outstandin g faculty. 2) Increase Value - UCI Health is redesigning integrated care and optimizing operations in order to deliver excellent care more cost -effectively. This includes: Enhancing service lines to deliver individualized care by the right provider, at the right time, in the right location Targeted program growth strategies to further UCI Health's differentiation in the market and meet the unique needs of the community Leveraging the scale and capabilities of UCI Health, the campus and the UC system to optimize performance and cost structure The current lack of inpatient capacity is a particular challenge for UCI Health and the new medical complex in Irvine will be an essential component of UCI Health's strategy to ensure continued access to academic medical care. Since the new Irvine campus will not open for inpatient care for several years, UCI Health continues to invest in the Medical Center at Orange by deploy ing multiple strategies to address these challenges including the recent opening of a new inpatient unit, expanding acute care capacity by 15 percent, the construction of a new, state - of-the-art imaging center to support outpatient imaging access, and expa nding operating room capacity through the additional use of off -campus ambulatory surgery facilities. By moving low - acuity cases to a lower -cost setting, UCI Health will be able to reduce the cost of such cases while also creating new capacity for complex cases on the existing medical center campus. In addition, UCI Health is enhancing relationships with psychiatric services in the county to fulfill an unmet need of post -acute psychiatric care. The Medical Center in Orange is, and will continue to be, the hub of UCI Health's growing health system even after the new Irvine medical complex is operational. UCI Health is reducing ongoing lease costs through a combined effort of consolidating into owned buildings and adhering to space allocation policies. UCI Health is accelerating the future of work and sustaining a lower footprint through remote work opportunities. This effort not only supports the achievement of increased value for UCI Health patients, but also is a way to increase co -worker engagement, sat isfaction, and retention. 3) Transform Ourselves - UCI Health is advancing healthcare delivery through innovation, discovery, and performance. This includes: Redefining market perception by increasing brand awareness and loyalty Developing and i nvesting in breakthrough innovations to disrupt how healthcare is delivered in Orange County Expanding access to novel therapies by advancing and accelerating clinical research HEALTH SERVICES COMMITTEE -13- H2 February 16, 2022 Just as digital health and new competitors have provided valuable disruptions in the way health care is delivered, UCI Health is striving to find innovative solutions to address challenges such as access, cost, and patient experience. This last year has included the introduction of novel solutions of bringing care to the patie nt's home, including a mobile urgent care solution, the first of its kind in the State of California, to increase access, enhance recovery, and improve outcomes. Additional investments in these strategies will include partnerships which enable UCI Health t o leverage these opportunities and accelerate the introduction of new models of care.
