Kasper, September 22, 2020 (sent for review August 26, 2020; reviewed by Arturo Casadevall and Robert W. Finberg) Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, has resulted thus far in greater than 933,000deaths worldwide; yet disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Clin- ical and immunological features of patients with COVID-19 have highlighted a potential role for changes in immune activity in reg-ulating disease severity. However, little is known about the re-sponses in human lung tissue, the primary site of infection. Here we show that pathways related to neutrophil activation and pul- monary fibrosis are among the major up-regulated transcriptionalsignatures in lung tissue obtained from patients who died of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Strikingly, the viral burden was low in all samples, which suggests that the patient deaths may be re-lated to the host response rather than an active fulminant infec-tion. Examination of the colonic transcriptome of these patients suggested that SARS-CoV-2 impacted host responses even at a site with no obvious pathogenesis. Further proteomics analysis validatedour transcriptome findings and proteins, suchas the SARS-CoV-2 entry-associated protease cathepsins B and L and the inflammatory response modulator S100A8/A9, that are highly expressed in fatal cases, revealing potential drug targets for COVID-19. COVID-19 |SARS-CoV-2 |neutrophil |fibrosis |NETosis SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019 (1). Since then, more than 29.5 million people have beeninfected worldwide, with over 933,000 deaths as of September 15,2020. Although research into the clinical and scientific featuresof SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis has progressed at a dizzying pace,pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still incompletely understood.Previous studies have noted profound SARS-CoV-2-inducedtranscriptional and immunological changes in cell culture and animal models (2, 3), as well as in human blood (4), nasopha- ryngeal samples (5), and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (6).However, it is notable how little is known about the host re-sponse to SARS-CoV-2 in human lung tissue given that COVID-19 deaths are primarily due to pneumonia-related complications. Results Lung Transcriptome Response in Fatal Cases. We obtained post- mortem lung samples from nine patients who died of COVID-19during the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China. The patients weresymptomatic for an average of 26 d (range, 14 to 34 d) prior to death (Fig. 1 A). Given that this was early in the outbreak, there was not a standard approach to treating patients, and they re- ceived a variety of antimicrobial and immunomodulatorymedications as presented in Dataset S1 , along with other de- tailed clinical findings. Consistent with other autopsy series(7-9), all patients had histological evidence of diffuse alveolar damage, with widespread hyaline membrane formation, evidence of fibrosis, and varying degrees of an inflammatory infiltrate.Notably, several patients were noted to have a significant num- ber of neutrophils present in the lung tissue (Fig. 1 B). To better understand the molecular basis underlying fatal COVID-19 cases, we performed total RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on the formalin-fixed paraffin- embedded (FFPE) lung samples from these 9 fatal cases; as control s, we used archived histologically normal lung tissue obtained from 10 SARS-CoV-2-uninfected Significance Although the overwhelming majority of COVID-19-related deaths are due to respiratory failure, little is known about the host response to SARS-CoV-2 in lung parenchyma. By profilingthe lung and colon transcriptome and lung proteome of ninepatients who died of COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic in Wuhan, China, we obtained molecular insights into the host response to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Inter-estingly, all samples had a low viral burden, a finding that suggests the patients 'deaths may be due to uncontrolled host inflammatory processes rather than an active viral infection.Taken together, our findings shed light on COVID-19 patho-physiology and offer potential therapeutic targets for severe COVID-19 disease.

First published October 20, 2020 |vol. that underwent biopsy or surgical resection as part of routine clinical care for lung cancer. Consistent with these con- trol samples representing noncancer-affected tissue, we did not observe enrichment of any cancer-related pathways. We identi-fied a total with1,470 up-regulated and 2,595 down-regulated genes in the COVID-19 patients (Fig. 2 A). There were numerous immune- related genes affected, some of which are highlighted in Fig. 2 A. Although patients with severe COVID-19 have been found tohave a cytokine storm in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (6, 10), we found in lung parenchyma a roughly equal number of up- and down-regulated genes that are relatedto cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors ( Dataset S2 ). Notably, expression of interleukin (IL)-6 was unchanged in thelungs of patients with COVID-19 ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1 ), a finding that raises a question about the potential for anti-IL-6 therapy to help resolve the pulmonary inflammatory process inpatients with severe disease. Given the profound degree of transcriptional changes ob- served, we sought to determine how much virus was present within these lung tissue samples. We recovered viral reads fromthe sequencing data and mapped them to the reference viralgenome of SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (11). Surprisingly, even though these patients all died of COVID-19 pneumonia and displayed a significant transcriptional response relative tohealthy controls, there were very few viral reads present in thesamples ( Dataset S3 ). Out of an average of 98.2 million reads per sample ( Dataset S4 ), we recovered only 2 to 177 viral reads in six of the cases. The other three cases had no reads that mapped to theSARS-CoV-2 genome at all; however, directed SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR of the input RNA used for RNA sequencing confirmed the presence of virus in these samples at low abundance ( SI Ap- pendix , Fig. S2 ). This finding of little virus being present in lung tissue at the time of death suggests that these patients may havedied of sequelae related to COVID-19 pneumonia (i.e., the hostinflammatory response) rather than an ongoing, fulminant active viral infection.Neutrophil Activation and Pulmonary Fibrosis Are Major Contributors to the Pathogenesis in the Lung. To systematically identify bio- logical pathways representative of the host tissue response inCOVID-19, we performed gene ontology (GO) enrichmentanalysis of significantly up- and down-regulated genes. The top60 enriched GO terms were further organized into a network with edges connecting overlapping gene sets. The functional modules were identified as the mutually overlapping gene setsclustered together and named using GO hierarchical structureterms (Fig. 2 B). Some of the modules identified, such as \"leu- kocyte migration \"and\"chromosome segregation \"(the latter of which contains gene sets relevant to mitosis and cell division),are not unexpected in response to severe infection. Othermodules, however, seemed less intuitive as a response to a viralpneumonia. The top two hits from the GO analysis of up-regulated genes reflected neutrophil activation and neutrophil-mediated immunity ( SI Appendix , Fig. S3 A), a finding that is consistent with the neutrophilic infiltrate observed upon histo-logic assessment of these tissues. Closer inspection of the up- regulated genes in the neutrophil activation pathways revealed many genes involved in the generation of neutrophil extracellulartraps (NETs), such as myeloperoxidase, lactoferrin, and histones(Fig. 2 CandDataset S5 ). NETs are known to form in the setting of infections as a defense mechanism against pathogens, in-cluding viruses (12); however, dysregulated NETosis triggered byplatelets can lead to ongoing tissue damage and thrombosis (13,14). Patients with COVID-19 have been found to have increasedserum levels of myeloperoxidase -DNA complexes and citrulli- nated histone both of are markers we identified foci DNA were colo- calized (Fig. 2 D), an observation that demonstrates the presence of NETs in the lungs of fatal COVID cases. Given the paucity ofviral RNA present in these samples and the overwhelming de-gree of pulmonary thromboses identified during the autopsies ofthese patients, it is possible that these NETs have been triggeredby platelets rather than SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with this hy-pothesis, expression of platelet factor 4, which is often involvedin platelet-triggered NETosis (16), is increased Appendix , Fig. S4 ). Another module identified in our network analysis that seemed less clearly relevant to a severe viral infection was \"ex- tracellular structure organization. \"We reasoned, however, that this gene cluster might reflect the hyaline membrane formationand fibrosis seen on histology. When we interrogated the func-tion of these genes further, we found that many of them (e.g.,MMP7, GDF15, and MUC5B) have been implicated in thepathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis (17) (Fig. 2 EandDataset S6). Indeed, many of these patients had been symptomatic for nearly a month prior to their ultimate demise, and they may havebegun to enter the fibrotic phase of diffuse alveolar damage (18).Moreover, it has been noted that patients with severe COVID-19develop a more typical picture of acute respiratory distress syn-drome with eventual loss of lung compliance (19). Considered together, our findings help bridge the clinical and histological observations with their molecular bases. Surprisingly, the top three GO terms that were down- regulated in the lung represent neurobiological processes: axonguidance, neuron projection guidance, and synapse organization(SI Appendix , Fig. S3 B). Expression of several semaphorins and their plexin receptors, genes that play a critical role in axonguidance, as well as airway development and disease (20), weredown-regulated, as were Ephrins and their Eph receptors, whichare expressed in lung epithelial cells and help regulate T cell activation (21, 22) ( SI Appendix , Fig. S5 A). Additionally, we observed down-regulated expression of three genes that aremarkers for pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs), which arespecialized epithelial cells important in airway sensory function Jan 10 Jan 20 Jan 30 Feb 9 Feb 19 Case 1 (70 yo M) Case 2 (66 yo F) Case 3 (53 yo F)Case 4 (85 yo M) Case 5 (86 yo F) Case 6 (62 yo M) Case 7 (51 yo M) Case 8 (78 yo M) Case 9 (67 yo F)Throat swab positive Throat swab negative Hospitalization Symptom onset CT thorax revealed bilateral pneumonia Date of death A B Fig. 1.

In- triguingly, defects in PNECs can lead to altered cytokine pro- duction and increased lung inflammation (23, 24). Broadly, thereis growing evidence of neuroimmune interactions in the lung (25, 26), and the down-regulation of these pathways may reflect an immunomodulatory process. Futu re work will be needed to deter- mine whether distinct lung-innervating neuronal subtypes or theirsynaptic nerve terminals are affected in lung tissues following infection. Colon Transcriptome Response in Fatal Cases. A total of 2 to 15% of patients with COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms such asdiarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting (27). None of the ninepatients had any gastrointestinal symptoms based on their medical records; however, we did detect all of the three marker genes of SARS-CoV-2 in one of the patients, and some frag-ments in other patients using SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (Fig. 3 A andDataset S3 ), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could exist in the gastrointestinal tract even when the primary infection-site lunghad a very low viral load. We further examined the transcrip-tional response in the gastrointestinal tract by performing total RNA sequencing on the FFPE colon samples from these 9 fatal cases and 10 uninfected individuals as control. We found thatalthough there is no obvious pathogenesis in the colon tissuebased on histological examination, there is a dramatic change in the transcriptome in the colon tissues in the fatal cases when compared to healthy controls. With the caveat that the controlsamples represent histologically normal tissue obtained frompatients with colon cancer, a total of 4,932 genes were identifiedas significantly differentially expressed genes, with 1,246 up-regulated and 3,686 down-regulated genes in the cases (Fig. 3 B). Principal component analysis (PCA) of all samples from the two tissue sites revealed clear separation of the lung and colon in the controls, while the tissue-specific separation is not so clear in thecases (Fig. 3 C). Consistent with the PCA, the pairwise Euclidean distances among the samples within the same tissue type is sig-nificantly lower than the pairwise Euclidean distances among thesamples across the tissue types in the controls, while such com-parison is no longer significant in COVID-19 cases ( SI Appendix , Fig. S6 ). We performed GO enrichment analysis on the colon tissues to compare the host response in these two sites (Fig. 3 DandE). There are very limited shared enriched pathways among these two sites, such as extracellular structure organization, \"ossifica- tion,\"and\"maintenance of location among the up-regulated pathways. \"The neutrophil signature is unique to the lung, sug- gesting that the massive increases of neutrophil infiltration intothe lung are a primary characteristic of this site.

The only GO term enriched in the down-regulated genes andshared by the two tissue sites was \"long-chain fatty acid catabolic process. \"The top nine of the enriched GO terms in down- regulated genes involved in immune cell activation and immu-nity suggested the immune system is disrupted in other organs aswell. Interestingly, the rest of the enriched GO terms in down-regulated genes are involved in metabolic processes, suggestingthe metabolic function might be affected in COVID-19 patients.Formally, it is possible that some of these colonic transcriptionalchanges reflect the critically ill nature of these patients and arenot specific to SARS-CoV-2 infection.Key Genes and Proteins in SARS-CoV-2 Viral Entry and Interactions in the Lung. To better integrate our findings with what is already known about SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in the lung, we exam-ined expression of genes that have previously been implicated inviral entry. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the pri-mary host receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry (28), was increased byapproximately fourfold in the lungs of patients with COVID-19(Fig. 4 A). TMPRSS2, a cellular serine protease that primes the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and has been shown to be im- portant in facilitating viral entry into cells (28), is down-regulatedin the lungs of fatal COVID-19 cases (Fig. 4 A). Two other proteases, cathepsins B and L, which are able to substitute forTMPRSS2 (28), had increased expression (Fig. 4 A), an obser- vation that suggests these cathepsins might be the more relevantproteases for viral entry into the lung epithelium.789 Patient10 20 30 40 50Ct Mean| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | E N RdRPReporterA C B-1000100 -100 0 growth factor stimulusendothelial cell differentiationtransmembrane receptor protein serine/threonine kinase signaling pathwayresponse to transforming growth factor betaendothelium developmentregulation of glucose importcellular response to transforming growth factor of chemokineIMP biosynthetic of leukocyte proliferationadaptive immune response based on somatic recombination of immune receptors built from immunoglobulin superfamily domainslymphocyte mediated immunitycellular response colon Count 25 50751e-18 7e-0512 3 456 Fig. 3.

Wu et al. PNAS |November 10, 2020 |vol. 117 |no. 45 |28339 MICROBIOLOGYAdditionally, in an effort to contextualize our transcriptome findings through the prism of functional genomics, we examinedthe expression level of genes that regulate SARS-CoV-2 patho-genesis as identified in a CRISPR screen (29), that interact with SARS-CoV-2 as assessed by protein -protein interactions (30), and that predispose to severe infection as characterized in agenome-wide association study (GWAS) (31) (Fig. 4 Band Datasets S7 -S9). Seven of the 104 genes identified in the CRISPR screen were up-regulated in 6 and CST6 are Of the 332 human proteinsfound to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, 34 were differen-tially expressed in our dataset, with the overwhelming majority (29 genes) being up-regulated. None of the genes identified in the GWAS screen were differentially expressed in the lungtissue of fatal cases, but XCL2, a chemokine ligand of one ofthe hits (XCR1), was significantly down-regulated. This subset of genes that have been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 patho- genesis and have altered expression levels in the lung of severecases may help guide future drug development for COVID-19.To further validate the transcriptome observation and evalu- ate the host response at the protein level, we performed pro- teomics analysis using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on these FFPE lung samples from cases and controls. In total, 4,689 proteins were detected by massspectrometry, 4,635 of them are also expressed in the transcriptome data. We identified a total of 637 differentially represented pro- teins, with 235 up-regulated and 402 down-regulated proteins in the cases (Fig. 4 CandDatasets S10 -S12). The correlation coefficient between the significantly genes and pro- teins is 0.81 ( Appendix ,F i g .S 7 ). Protease cathepsin B and L are also significantly highly represented in cases compared to thecontrols ( 5.2-fold and 2.6-fold increase, A8, A9, A11, A12, and P are more highly expressed and translated in the cases vs. controls (Fig. 4 E). S100A8/A9 and S100A12, proinflammatory mediators, which are commonly found at inflammatory sites and in the serum of patients with inflam matory disease, contribute to modulate the local inflammatory response by stimulating leukocyterecruitment and induce cytokine sec retion (32). These cytoplasmic proteins are mainly secreted by cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages, which is consistent wi th our observation of increased neutrophils and NETosis in the lun g of fatal COVID-19 patients.0.00.51.0 Counts per million (CPM) 0510 300600ACE2 ** 1.5TMPRSS2 * 20 15CTSB ***1200 900CTSL *** 200 150 100 50 Case Control Case Control Case Control Case ControlCounts per million (CPM) Counts per million (CPM) Counts per million (CPM) 12IFQ IntensityCTSB 123IFQ IntensityCTSL Case Control Case Control *** *** DE 0100200300 (Counts per million) CPMS100A8 050100150 (Counts per million) CPMS100A9 300600900 (Counts per million) CPMS100A11 020406080 (Counts per million) CPMS100A12 051015 (Counts per million) CPMS100P Case Control Case Control Case Control Case Control Case Control*** *** *** Control Case Control Case Control Case Control* ns *** ** *** AC B Fig. 4.

S100A8/9 is known to be expressed and secreted during infection-induced in- flammation and is restricted by a negative feedback regulatory mechanism (36). Given the low viral load in these patients, thesustained elevation of S100A8/A9 level lends further support to the idea that an uncontrolled immune reaction contributes to the pa- thology. GO enrichment analysis of significantly up-regulated pro- teins identified four neutrophil-related GO terms as top enriched GO terms, as well as extracellular structure organization ( SI Ap- pendix ,F i g .S 8 ), consistent with the enriched GO pathways iden- tified in the transcriptome data. Therefore, these highly expressed proteins such as S100 proteins, might represent potential thera-peutic targets that facilitate regulation of the excessive inflam- mation response in COVID-19 patients with severe disease. Discussion We have performed a detailed assessment of the host response to SARS-CoV-2 in human lung, a site of critical importance inSARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, given the worldwide burden of morbidity and mortality stemming from COVID-19 pneumonia- related complications. Given that our data originate from a co- hort of patients who died of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, during the very beginning of the pandemic, these data will serve as animportant resource that helps provide a baseline of the host response to the earliest SARS-CoV-2 strains against which fu- ture datasets can be compared. It is likely that mutations will continue to accumulate in the circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains, and the host response of future patient cohorts can subsequentlybe compared to this Wuhan dataset to better understand the evolution of host -virus interactions. Moreover, this Wuhan co- hort represents the closest approximation to the \"natural his- tory\"of COVID-19 that is likely to be studied, particularly since later patients \u2014even in the early stages of the outbreak in the United States \u2014were quickly being enrolled in a variety of clin- ical trials to assess different therapeutics. The finding that these fatal cases had a low viral load in the setting of massive transcriptional changes is suggestive that pa- tient deaths may be more related to an overexuberant and un- controlled host response rather than unabated viral replication.This observation is consistent with what was seen in patients who died of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infections and fits within the damage -response framework (37, 38), which holds that on- going host damage may be the result of the host immune re- sponse rather than persistent microbial interactions. Moreover,our findings of a low viral burden at the time of fatal outcome may help explain why direct antivirals, such as remdesivir (39), are more effective in patients with less severe disease anddexamethasone, an immunosuppressant, is associated with re- duced mortality in severely ill patients late in disease (40). Ultimately, understanding the host response to SARS-CoV-2 in human lungs \u2014the main site of infection leading to morbidity and mortality \u2014may help inform future clinical trials for COVID-19 therapeutics. For example, our finding that expres- sion of IL-6 is not increased in the lungs of these fatal cases highlights that anti-IL-6 therapies may not be an effectivetreatment for severe, late-stage COVID-19 pneumonia, which is consistent with preliminary randomized clinical trial findings (41, 42). The observation that neutrophils are transcriptionally enriched in the lungs with histologic evidence of NET formation may provide scientific justification for the 9 ongoing clinical trialstesting the efficacy of dornase alfa. Moreover, the finding that expression of cathepsins B and L \u2014but not TMPRSS2 \u2014is ele- vated in the lungs suggests that inhibitors of these proteases may help prevent viral entry (43). Continued study of the host re- sponse in concert with ongoing viral evolution will be critical tobetter understand these host -virus dynamics and provide a more complete understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis. Materials and Methods Human Lung and Colon Samples. Eight patients who died at Jinyintan Hospital (Wuhan, China) and one patient who died at Central Hospital of Wuhan as aresult of COVID-19 underwent autopsies, during which samples were takenfrom representative areas of the lung and colon for routine histologic analysis. Clinical data regarding these deceased individuals were abstracted from the medical records. The control (uninfected) lung or colon samples(n=10 for each control group) represent healthy tissue obtained from pa- tients with lung cancer or colon cancer during biopsy and/or surgical resec-tion performed as part of routine clinical care. These control patients werematched to the cases with respect to age, sex, and past medical history.Lung/colon tissues were fixed with 10% formalin for 3 d at room tempera- ture, trimmed into appropriate size and shape, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 4- m-thick sections for further histological and immunohistochem- istry staining. The study protocol was approved by the Tongji Hospital af-filiated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science andTechnology Institutional Review Board (approval TJ-IRB20200341). Immunofluorescence Staining for NETs. The FFPE lung tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. Antigen retrieval was performed by heat andpressure with Tris-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) buffer (pH 9.0) for 1.5 min. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 15 min followed by blocking with 10% sheep serum for 15 min.The sample was incubated washed with tris-buffered saline (TBS)buffer, placed in Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 9.0), and heated for 10 min in a mi-crowave for antigen retrieval. Samples were blocked with 10% donkey se-rum for 15 min, incubated overnight at 4 Alexa Fluor594-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H&L) (Thermo Fisher). DAPI was used to stain DNA. Images were scanned using a Pannoramic MIDI (3DHIS- TECH; Budapest, Hungary). Library Preparation and Sequencing. Total RNA was isolated from FFPE lung or colon tissue from cases and controls using the RNeasy FFPE kit (Qiagen)according to the manufacturer 's instructions with a minor modification. Thin tissue sections weighing 0.1 mg were used for each sample, and an addi- tional genomic DNA removal step was performed by treating the sample with 2 units of TURBO DNA-free DNase (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. The Trio RNA-Seq Library Preparation Kit (Nugen; Redwood City, CA) was used togenerate sequencing libraries as per the manufacturer 's instructions, with 1 to 5 ng RNA used as input. The library size and quality were assessed usingan Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. Pooled libraries were sequenced on an IlluminaNextSEq 550 using a 75-cycle kit with single-end read mode. SARS-CoV-2 Detection by RT-PCR. Quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the RNA obtained from the FFPE samples was performed using the 2019-nCoV Real Time Triplex RT-PCR Kit (Liferiver Bio-Tech; Shanghai, China) per the manufacturer 's instructions. This kit employs primers specific for three dif- ferent SARS-CoV-2 genes envelope [E], and RNA polymerase [RdRp] genes) and requires that all threegenes be detected with a cycle threshold 40 to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is present. RT-PCR reactions were performed on 7500 Real-Time PCR Systems(Applied Biosystems). Bioinformatic Analysis. Raw sequence reads were using Trim Galore (v0.6.4, https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore ) with parameters \"-quality 20, -stringency 3, -length 20 \"to remove both poor quality calls and adapters. Trimmed reads were first aligned to t he human reference genome hg19 using STAR 2.7.3a (44) with default parameters, and a quality control (QC) report wasgenerated using RNA-SeQC 1.1.8 (45). A count table was generated parameters \"-a 10, -m intersection-nonempty \"using HTSEq 0.11.4 (46). Genes that were differentially expressed between cases and controls were characterized using DESeq2 (47) by identifying genes with |log2FC |>1a n da P-adjusted value <0.05. Wu et 10, 2020 117 |no. 45 |28341 MICROBIOLOGYPathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes was performed using the R package clusterProfiler (48), with org.Hs.eg.db used for anno-tation. Enriched GO pathways were identified as GO terms that had aP-adjusted value <0.05 after Benjamini -Hochberg correction for multiple testing. One representative term was selected from redundant terms for a similarity >0.6 using the simplify function in clusterProfiler. The enriched GO terms were organized into a network with edges connecting overlappinggene sets with an overlapping threshold value of 0.2. The GO modules arethe clusters of the GO terms with mutually overlapping gene sets, and theywere named using the GO hierarchical structure in AmiGO2 (49). Volcano plots were generated using the R package ggplot2. To assess expression of immune-related genes, we interrogated the genes that aredescribed in Immport ( https://www.immport.org/shared/genelists ). To de- termine previously implicated as important in SARS-CoV-2pathophysiology are differentially expressed in lung tissue of patients, wemanually extracted gene lists from the literature (29 -31) ( Datasets S7 -S12). All box and whisker plots were generated using the R package ggplot2. The box depicts the first to the third quartile, and the horizontal line indicates the median. Interquartile range (IQR) was calculated as the first quartilesubstracted from the third quartile. The whiskers extend to the most ex-treme dataset value that is within 1.5 times the IQR of the box. The datapoints outside the whiskers represent outliers. Heatmaps were generated by using the R package pheatmap to plot the expression level of genes up-regulated in the Wuhan cases. For the heatmap of neutrophil-related genes, we included the genes in the GO terms in theGO network module \"neutrophil-mediated immunity \"as well as a published molecular signature of NETs (50). For the heatmap of extracellular structureorganization-related genes, we included the genes in the GO terms in theGO network module named extracellular structure organization as well as fibrosis-related genes (downloaded from http://biokb.ncpsb.org/fibroatlas/ index.php ). Principal component analysis was performed on the matrix containing the log transformation of the counts per million (cpm) reads for each gene acrossall cases and controls using the R function prcomp and plotted by ggbiplot,and the 95% confidence interval of groups was plotted as ellipses. PairwiseEuclidean distances among the samples within the same tissue type (intra- distance) and across the tissue types (interdistance) were calculated in cases and controls separately, then multivariate analysis was performed usingadonis function in R package Vegan (51) with 999 permutation. SARS-CoV-2 Mapping. The reads that did not map to the human genome hg19 were filtered by read length <75 bp and aligned to the genome of SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (National Center for Biotechnology Infor-mation [NCBI] NC_045512), using bowtie2 with default parameters (52). Thereads that mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 genome were further filtered by alignment with mapping quality MAPQ <30 using samtools 1.9 (53), with the resulting reads representing the number of SARS-CoV-2 viral reads presentin the sample. Read count per 100 bp was calculated using samtools 1.9. Protein Extraction and Digestion. Protein extraction from FFPE tissues was performed according to previous methods (54, 55). Briefly, samples weredewaxed in xylene and pelleted by centrifugation. 1% protease inhibitor mixture). After sonication for 5 min (3 s on, and 5 s off) at 30% amplitude, the tubes were heated at 100 \u00b0C for 30 min and subse- quently centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 \u00d7g. The supernatant containing the extracted proteins was recovered and quantified using a bicinchoninicacid (BCA) test. Proteins were reduced in 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min and alkylated at room temperature in 11 mM iodoacetamide(IAA) for 15 min in the dark. Then the proteins were added to the filtermembrane for filter-aided sample preparation. The membrane was washed three times with 8 M urea and then washed three times with 20 mM NH 4HCO 3at 12,000 \u00d7g. A total of 3containing trypsin (protein:trypsin the membrane and in- cubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C. Peptides were harvested from the membrane bycentrifuging for 10 min at 12,000 \u00d7gand then desalted using C18 pre- column and finally dried down using a vacuum centrifuge (Thermo). Allsamples were stored at 80 \u00b0C for further analysis. LC-MS/MS Analysis. The tryptic peptides were dissolved in solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water), directly loaded onto a home-made reversed-phase analytical column (25-cm length, 75 m internal diameter [i.d.]). Peptides were separated with a gradient from 4 to 6% solvent B (0.1% formic acid inacetonitrile) in 2 min, 6 to 24% over 68 min, 24 to 32% in 14 min, andclimbing to 80% in 3 min, then holding at 80% for the last 3 min, all at aconstant flow rate of 300 nL/min on a nanoElute high-performance liquidchromatography (UHPLC) system (Bruker Daltonics). The peptides were capillary source followed by the timsTOF Pro (Bruker Daltonics) mass spectrometry. The electrospray voltage appliedwas 1.60 kV. Precursors and fragments were analyzed at the TOF detector, with a MS/MS scan range from 100 to 1700 m/z. The timsTOF Pro was op- erated in parallel accumulation serial fragmentation (PASEF) mode. Precur-sors with charge states 0 to 5 were selected for fragmentation, and 10PASEF-MS/MS scans were acquired per cycle. The dynamic exclusion was setto 30 s. Proteomics Database Search. The resulting MS/MS data were processed using Maxquant search engine (v.1.6.6.0). Tandem mass spectra were searchedagainst the Uniprot human database (20,366 sequences, released at 2020/05)concatenated reverse decoy database. Trypsin/P was specified as cleavage enzyme allowing up to two missing cleavages. The mass tolerance for precursor ions was set as 40 ppm in both first search and main search, andthe mass tolerance for fragment ions was set as 0.04 Da. Carbamidomethyl onCys was specified as fixed modification, and acetylation on protein N-terminaland oxidation on Met were specified as variable modifications. Peptide andprotein false discovery rate (FDR) were adjusted to <1%. Data Availability. The raw sequence data from the Wuhan cases and controls have been deposited to NCBI with BioProject accession no. PRJNA646224 .A l l data processing was performed as described in Materials and Methods using publicly available software. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.
