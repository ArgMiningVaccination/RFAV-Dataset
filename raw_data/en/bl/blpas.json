To reduce the risk of enamel erosion, try to drink your lemon water through the straw and rinse your mouth with plain water afterward. Citric acid can also be the reason for heartburn in some people. Others, however, experience relief from heartburn after drinking lemon water, since lemon juice becomes alkaline, reducing acidity in digestion. Some people visit the bathroom more frequently after drinking lemon water. However, there is no evidence that vitamin C from lemons has diuretic effects ( [1](https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/benefits-of-lemon-water)).
