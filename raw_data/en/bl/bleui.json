Maharishi AyurVeda identifies three fundamental principles of Nature's functioning, which operate throughout Nature and are also found in our mind and body. These principles are called Doshas - they are three: Vata, Pitta and Kapha. Health is established when the Doshas are in balance; when out of balance, they create disease. Each individual has a unique Dosha constitution, and many factors to which we are subjected influence the Doshas - our diet, daily routine, the seasons, etc. Essential oils can help in the process of bringing them back to balance. The traditional Ayur-Vedic Physicians have classified quite a few essential oils according to their predominant qualities of Vata, Pitta and Kapha - by customizing the treatment and using the right essential oil for each individual's constitution, balance is brought back to mind, body and emotions. Therefore, Maharishi AyurVeda Aroma Therapy is a beautiful gift of knowledge for holistic and personalised health care. Many essential oils have potent anti-viral, anti-bacterial and/or anti-fungal properties. Some are excellent digestive tonics, and some are especially beneficial for the respiratory system or the bones, circulation, etc. Each essential oil is unique in its therapeutic properties but, in general, they bring benefits to all our psychophysiological systems, providing us with holistic health care. Essential oils are particularly balancing to the emotions; they easily and spontaneously bring about a balanced state of mind. Vata pacifying essential oils balance an excess of Vata. In general, they have a calming and warming effect. In addition, they have pain-relieving properties and are recommended, for example, in cases of overload and stress, in the evening, while travelling, and sometimes, during the cold season (autumn and winter). Pitta pacifying essential oils balance an excess of Pitta. Mostly, they are suitable for digestion and have a cooling and soothing quality. Some benefits are that they balance a hot temper and excessive appetite and are especially recommended during summer. Kapha pacifying essential oils balance an excess of Kapha. They have a heating and stimulating effect. They are suitable for slow metabolism, may help counter overweight and apathy, and may be recommended when the weather is cold and wet and in the spring.
