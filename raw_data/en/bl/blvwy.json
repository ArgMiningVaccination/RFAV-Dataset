Executive Summary The purpose of this community health needs assessment (CHNA) is to identify and prioritize significant health needs for over 186,000 community members served by French Hospital Medical Center (FHMC). The priorities identified in this report help to guide the hospital's community health improvement programs and community benefit activities, as well as, its collaborative efforts with other organizations that share a mission to improve health. This CHNA report meets the requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that not-for-profit hospitals conduct a community health needs assessment at least once every three years. FHMC is located at 1911 Johnson Avenue in the City of San Luis Obispo, California and has a long and rich history of serving the needs of the community since it was founded in 1946, and joined Dignity Health in 2004. Recently, FHMC announced both phases of their new emergency department have opened and is now the most advanced emergency service facility in San Luis Obispo County. FHMC is a 98-bed facility that offers services including cardiac care, critical care, diagnostic imaging, emergency medicine, and obstetrics. The FHMC community includes zip codes 93401, and 93465 (Templeton) and is home to 186,377 residents. Approximately 70% of the FHMC community considers themselves White alone, not Hispanic or Latino(a). The Hispanic or Latino(a) population of the FHMC community is approximately one-fifth (20.4%) of the total population, and the Asian community accounts for 4% of the total population. In addition to the residents mentioned above, San Luis Obispo County is home to a transient farmworker population drawn to work in the fields, which includes indigenous migrants from the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Guerrero. These individuals are often monolingual in their native pre-Hispanic indigenous language of Mixtec or Zapotec, and have an estimated population of 17,771 farmworkers in San Luis Obispo County. The FHMC community is unique due to its location on the Central Coast, with vast unincorporated areas, striking natural beauty, and thriving communities'. Behind the striking natural beauty are geographically isolated communities, that may host one of the 988 individuals experiencing homelessness in the area. Underrepresented individuals can be found residing in poverty working in the shadows of the agriculture, tourism, or retail industry. The hospital's dedication to engaging with the community, assessing priority needs, and helping to address them with community health program activities is in keeping with its mission. As CommonSpirit Health, we make the healing presence of God known in our world by improving the health of the people we serve, especially those who are vulnerable, while we advance social justice for all. The CHNA process was completed through quantitative and qualitative methods to collect and analyze primary and secondary data. This mixed-methods approach validates data by cross verifying from multiple sources, providing a broader perspective of the community and population health needs. v Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 French Hospital Medical Center In order to gain a thorough understanding of the medically underserved, low-income and minority populations living in FHMC's primary service area, an original community health survey was developed. A 38-question community health survey served as a primary data source. The community health survey was based upon select questions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey Questionnaire (BRFSS) and previous CHNA reports prepared by Dignity Health. The final survey was distributed in-person in the community and was available online, to adults age 18 and older, in Spanish, English, and Mixteco. Using convenience sampling (non-probability) methods, survey responses were collected from 18 different locations within the community, including churches, senior centers, community events, homeless shelters, etc. Survey locations were selected based on the perception of being able to encounter the most vulnerable populations, including the medically underserved, low-income, and minority populations. A total of 403 individuals invested ten minutes of their time and completed the health survey in hopes of bettering their health and bringing better programs to the community. The significant community health needs identified for the FHMC community extend far beyond health and health care. Social factors, including education, employment status, income level, gender, and ethnicity, all contribute to health inequities. According to the CDC, racial and ethnic minority groups, throughout the United States, experience higher rates of illness and death across a wide range of health conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, asthma, and heart disease, when compared to their White counterparts.1 Based upon perceptions of the community, the known health needs, and secondary health metrics, the three most significant health needs were identified. In accordance with Dignity Health policy, the following criteria were utilized to evaluate the prioritization of community needs, including: Size or scale of problem (how many impacted); Severity of problem; Disparity and equity; Known effective interventions; Resource feasibility and sustainability; and, Community support. Attaining health equity in the FHMC community will require addressing the greatest disparities and helping the pockets of the community that are facing a constant uphill battle with everyday life. 1 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2022. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Health Equity. Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/healthequity/racism-disparities/index.html. vi Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 French Hospital Medical Center The following significant community health needs were determined for this 2022 CHNA report, including: Educational attainment; Access to primary health care, behavioral health care, and oral health; and, Health promotion and prevention. Education has been described as the most important modifiable social determinant of health, and low educational attainment levels are linked with poor health, more stress, higher poverty, and lower self-efficacy. Overall, 7.5% of the FHMC community (or 9,075 individuals) over the age of 25 did not graduate high school or equivalent. However, the 2022 community health survey found that 38.3% (n=154) survey participants reported they did not complete high school (or equivalent), and nearly 20% (n=79) of survey participants reported they did not complete schooling beyond elementary school. The lowest levels of education found in the community health survey were found in the surveys completed in Spanish or Mixteco. The need for an improvement in access to primary health care, behavioral health care, and oral health has been substantiated through primary data, secondary data, and HRSA. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) has designated a mental health professional shortage area in Arroyo Grande/San Luis Obispo (HPSA ID: 7063481715). HRSA also as a medically underserved community (MUA/P: 06206). Lastly, health promotion and prevention is the third identified need within this CHNA Report. Heart disease and cancer are the leading causes of death at local, state, and national levels, while the most vulnerable members of the FHMC community struggle to access health care. If the vulnerable communities are struggling to access health care, they are less likely to understand their current health status and access preventative cancer screenings. Besides difficulty accessing health care, the vulnerable communities face increased risk for heart disease and cancer due to their social determinants of health. They face food insecurity and more often live in areas that have higher levels of pollution. In order to help the most vulnerable communities reduce their chances of developing heart disease, cancer, or another chronic condition, targeted upstream health promotion and prevention is needed. While potential resources are available to address the identified needs of the community, the needs are too significant for any one organization. Making a substantial and upstream impact will require the collaborative efforts of community organizations, local government, local business leaders, and other institutions. This CHNA report was adopted by the French Hospital Medical Center Community Board in May 2022. The report is widely available to the public on the hospital's web site, and a paper copy is available for inspection upon request at FHMC Community Education Office. Written comments on this report can be submitted to FHMC Manager of Community Health at 1911 Johnson Avenue, San Luis Obispo, CA 93401 or you may email CHNA-CCSAN@DignityHealth.org. 7 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 French Hospital Medical Center III. Community Definition French Hospital Medical Center (FHMC) serves a community that extends over 35-miles in San Luis Obispo County including the communities of the City of San Luis Obispo, Atascadero, Templeton, Morro Bay, Los Osos, Cambria, and Paso Robles. The FHMC defined community does not exclude any low-income or underserved populations and includes all members of the community. The communities served by FHMC align with the residence location for 75% of all inpatient discharges, as well as the most recent Community Benefit Report. The geographic area of the communities served by FHMC are shown on the following Figure 1. Figure 1. FHMC Communities' Served FHMC is located at 1911 Johnson Avenue in the City of San Luis Obispo, CA. The community served by FHMC includes the following: Health Needs 2022 French Hospital Medical Center 93442 (Morro Bay); 93446 (Paso Robles); and, 93465 (Templeton). According the American Community Survey (2016-2020, 5-year average), the FHMC community is home to 186,377 residents, of which, approximately 47,000 reside within the City of San Luis Obispo.2 Approximately 70% of the FHMC community considers themselves White alone, not Hispanic or Latino(a). The Hispanic or Latino(a) population of the FHMC community is approximately one-fifth (20.4%) of the total population, and the Asian community accounts for 4% of the total population. Additionally, nearly 4% of the FHMC community identifies as two or more races. The FHMC community is home to a youth/young adult population (under age 25) that accounts for over 65,000 residents. However, 36% (23,357) of these reside in zip code 93405 (San Luis Obispo), are between the ages of 18 to 24 years, and are likely affiliated with Cal Poly. High school graduation rates in the FHMC community (age 25 and over) varies by zip code and ranges from a low of 86.6% in zip code 93405 (San Luis Obispo) to a high of 96.9% in 93465 (Templeton). The FHMC community is home to over 33,000 residents age 65 years and over, or nearly 18% of the FHMC community. The majority of 65 and over residents in the FHMC community reside in Paso Robles, Atascadero, and San Luis Obispo. The U.S. Census reports that the median age in California is 36.7 years, which is lower than the median age of six FHMC communities. The median age in 93428 (Cambria) is 60.9 and in 93442 (Morro Bay) it is 50.7. The median age in 93446 (Paso Robles) just exceeds the state level, however 93402 (Los Osos) and 93465 (Templeton) are approximately 10 points above the state median age. According to the U.S. Census, 2016-2020 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, poverty levels exceed state (12.6%) and national levels (12.8%) in the following FHMC community locations: Zip code 93401 (San Luis Obispo), 13.6% of the population are below 100% of the poverty level; and, Zip code 93405 (San Luis Obispo), 40.4% or 9,323 individuals are below 100% of the poverty line. In addition to the residents captured by the formalized data sources above, the transient farmworker population drawn to work in the fields of San Luis Obispo County are supported by indigenous migrants from the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Guerrero. These indigenous migrants are often monolingual in their native pre-Hispanic indigenous language of Mixtec or 2 U.S. Census Bureau (2022). 2016-2020 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimate. https://data.census.gov/cedsci/profile?g=1600000US0669196 9 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 French Hospital Medical Center Zapotec. According to the National Center for Farmworker Health in 2017, there were an estimated 17,771 farmworkers in San Luis Obispo County.3 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2021 local homeless population count in San Luis Obispo County was not completed and delayed to 2022. The 2022 Homeless Census and Survey for San Luis Obispo County was conducted in February 2022, and their results should be referenced and utilized for any future programming once released. The 2019 Homeless Census and Survey for San Luis Obispo County documented 988 sheltered and unsheltered individuals experiencing homelessness in the following FHMC communities: 482 individuals in San Luis Obispo; 239 individuals in Paso Robles; 173 individuals in Atascadero; and, 94 individuals in Morro Bay. In addition, the 2019 Homeless Census and Survey documented 393 sheltered and unsheltered individuals experiencing homelessness in the unincorporated areas of San Luis Obispo County, which includes portions of the FHMC community.

The CNI analyzes data at the zip code level for five factors known to contribute, or are barriers to health care access, including income, culture/language, education, housing status, and insurance coverage. Scores from 1.0 (lowest barriers) to 5.0 (highest barriers) for each factor are averaged to calculate a CNI score for each zip code in the community. Research has shown that communities with the highest CNI scores experience twice the rate of hospital admissions for ambulatory care sensitive conditions as those with the lowest scores. The average CNI score for the FHMC community was 3.3. The CNI scores range from a low of 2.6 in Templeton (93465) to 4 in San Luis Obispo (93401). The following Figure 2 provides further detail for the geographical distribution of CNI scores.7 5 Health Resources and Services Administration, 2022.

FHMC Community Needs Index Scores 13 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 French Hospital Medical Center IV. Assessment Process and Methods The 2022 CHNA was completed using quantitative and qualitative data from a variety of primary and secondary data sources. Primary data sources included a community health survey, a qualitative community health needs survey, and focus groups of priority populations. Secondary data sources at the local, state, and national level provided quantitative data. This mixed-methods approach validates data by cross verifying from multiple sources, providing a broader perspective of the community and population health needs. Each data source and the process utilized for assessment and collection is described in the following subsections. Community Health Survey, Vulnerable Populations As in prior CHNAs, FHMC once again solicited and took into account feedback from the medically underserved, low-income, and minority FHMC community members, including those with limited English proficiency, using an original community health survey. The original community health survey was developed based upon select questions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey Questionnaire (BRFSS) and previous CHNA reports prepared by Dignity Health. Input on the community health survey was also provided by the Community Benefit Committee at FHMC and San Luis Obispo County Public Health Department. A cultural competency review of the draft survey and translation into Spanish was completed by Dignity Health's Community Health Education Department. The final survey contained a total of 38-questions and was available in Spanish, English, and Mixteco languages. A copy of the English version can be found in Appendix B. Prior to launching the community health survey collection, a surveyor training was held on June 3, 2021. The purpose of the training was for all surveyors to understand the process and requirements for survey collection activities. Surveyors were trained how to complete a one-on-one interview with the participant, if they requested assistance to complete the health survey. The community health surveyors were members of the Dignity Health Community Health Department, Herencia Ind\u00edgena, and the promotores network in San Luis Obispo County. The anonymous community health surveys were distributed using a convenience sampling strategy (non-probability) to survey adults (age 18 and over) living in the FHMC community. This survey was not designed to be statistically representative of all residents in the community, but rather to provide an understanding of the social and health needs of the most vulnerable adult community members. Therefore, survey collection locations were selected based upon the perception of being able to encounter the target survey population. Before any community health surveys were collected, the responsible party at each location was contacted and permission was requested. A total of 403 community health surveys were collected between June and July 2021 at 16 different locations in the FHMC community. Survey locations included churches, senior centers, 14 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 French Hospital Medical Center community events, homeless shelters, housing development locations, farm worker housing, a COVID-19 vaccination site, and foodbanks. Survey participants did not receive any compensation or incentive in exchange for completing the health survey. During this same time period, the community health survey was also input into Survey Monkey and the link to participate was advertised through various local agencies. A complete list of the community locations where surveys were collected can be found in Appendix B. The community health survey data was compiled in Survey Monkey, which increased data quality and streamlined data analysis. Survey responses were analyzed using IBM SPSS statistics package and the results are discussed in the following chapter of this CHNA Report. Survey responses were analyzed as compared to various independent variables, including, place of residence, educational attainment, race/origin, and age. Complete results from the community health survey are provided in Appendix B. The community health survey was completed by 403 individuals residing in the FHMC community ranging from 18 to over 90 years of age. As previously stated, purpose of the community health survey was to gain a thorough understanding of the medically underserved, low-income, and minority populations living in the FHMC community. The effort to capture responses from these individuals resulted in nearly half of survey participants (44.0%) electing to complete their community health survey in Spanish, and three individuals completing their health survey interview in Mixteco. Individuals who do not speak English can face challenges in many areas, including access to health care and understanding medical information. The survey participants' place of residence and their community health survey language is provided on the following table. Table 3.

Qualitative Targeted Outreach A qualitative survey was prepared and distributed to targeted organizations seeking their input to help identify and prioritize significant health needs in the adult and youth population, and identify any potential resources. Dignity Health reached out to various community partners including those representing the following communities: Latino(a); African American; Homeless; LGBTQ+; Seniors; the Community Benefit Committee of the FHMC Community Board; other local health care providers; and county public health departments. The list of organizations that were provided the opportunity to complete the qualitative survey can be found in Appendix C. The survey was prepared and made available between January 14 - February 4, 2022 using a cloud-based survey software. An email was sent to each organization with the chance to respond to the online survey (via Survey Monkey) or request an open discussion instead. The original survey and email transmission is available in Appendix C and specifically sought feedback on the following six items: As an organization and/or community member, what do you view as the top 5 greatest health needs facing our community? As an organization or community member, how would you address these needs? Are you aware of any potential resources that are available to help address these needs? What is the most important youth health need in our community? What would you say is the most important thing that can be done to improve child health in our community? 16 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 French Hospital Medical Center What is the greatest barrier to child wellness in our community? A total of 39 responses were received from various individuals between January and February of 2022. These responses were downloaded from the cloud-based survey software and the responses were grouped based on the response. After the responses were grouped, the data was tabulated and utilized in the decision making process of developing the identified needs for this CHNA. Survey response grouping and the tabulated responses can be found in Appendix C. Gala Pride and Diversity Center The Gala Pride and Diversity Center supports and empowers people of all sexual orientations, gender identities, and expressions to strengthen and unite the Central Coast Community. The Gala Pride and Diversity Center advocates for the Central Coast's LGBTQ+ community and helps them find support services. A focus group was facilitated by Patty Herrera, MA, Manager of Community Health, Dignity Health Central Coast, with six members of the Gala Pride and Diversity Center via a video conference. The purpose of the discussion was to discuss the health needs facing LGBTQ+ community of all kinds (transgender, intersex individuals, people with expansive gender or sexual orientations, gender identities, expression, youth, seniors) and discuss their responses to the six qualitative CHNA questions. The focus group participants specifically support the trans and nonbinary people residing in Northern Santa Barbara County and San Luis Obispo County. The Gala participants identified the greatest health needs as follows: They want to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation. Access to culturally competent, respectful physicians, behavioral health providers, nurses, and office staff that accept CenCal. Many trans people are underemployed/unemployed, and finding health care that accepts their insurance is a \"huge\" problem. Focus group participants said they often feel they are treated as a \"piece of meat.\" Beyond cultural competency, many times health care is not specialized in addressing their health needs. They \"face an uphill battle accessing gender diverse health care\" and need local gender affirming providers and specialists that accept CenCal. There are currently only two known providers that take CenCal that specialize in the LGBTQ+ community. The focus group participants said they want to feel safe at medical facilities. They spoke of the harsh and discriminatory situations they often face when trying to access local providers and hospitals. Nonbinary people seem to be facing more discrimination in the health care system because they do not fit into a \"male\" or \"female\" box. Many LGBTQ+ youth face bullying by other classmates and parents \"gate keep\" and put up \"roadblocks\" to children seeking care. Unaffirming families often impact the youth mental health and can have youth in crisis. 17 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 French Hospital Medical Center Community Stakeholder Interview On April 28, 2022, a community stakeholder interview was facilitated by Patty Herrera, MA, Manager of Community Health, Dignity Health Central Coast and Jean Raymond, RN, MSN, GCNS-BC, who serves as a gerontological clinical nurse specialist for Dignity Health Central Coast, is a faith community nurse at St. Williams Catholic Church in Atascadero, CA, and is also a member of the San Luis Obispo Health Commission. Amanda Tamburro, MPH, consultant and report author also participated in the meeting which was held via video conference. The purpose of the interview was to discuss the health needs facing senior residents of the FHMC community. Mrs. Raymond stated the greatest challenges facing seniors impact their health status and quality of life, including transportation, housing, food insecurity, and caregiver support. The FHMC community is home to four senior only housing locations located in Morro Bay, Atascadero, and Paso Robles. The locations of the senior housing are situated in more remote areas of the FHMC community, which creates barriers for seniors to find transportation to activities/appointments outside of their housing development. While there is a senior transport service, navigating the process of arranging a ride can be difficult, especially due to the age of the internet. Many seniors find navigating the internet overwhelming, and give up before making arrangements. They are then encouraged to reach out to the social worker to help them navigate the process, however, the social workers are over-extended trying to support large geographies with limited staff. Some seniors only source of income is social security, which can be less than $1,000 per month. Seniors struggle to access affordable housing or face monthly housing costs that are a large portion of their monthly income. (According to the U.S. Census, in San Luis Obispo County there are 6,186 rental housing units occupied by residents age 65 or over. 53.1% spend more than 30% of their monthly income on rent.) The transportation, income, and housing struggles leads to food insecurity. Meals that Connect is a program that provides hot meals daily to seniors in San Luis Obispo County. In 2020 and 2021, they delivered 5,000 hot meals daily to seniors in San Luis Obispo County. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated depression and isolation among the senior residents of the FHMC community. The pandemic also placed a strain on caregivers, and caregiver support is vital. Finding quality caregivers can be a challenge and seniors struggle to navigate the caregiver system. San Luis Obispo County Public Health Department Representatives from the San Luis Obispo County Public Health Department (SLOPHD) were initially approached in early 2021, regarding the CHNA process Dignity Health was initiating for their 2022 CHNA Report. During this time period COVID-19 was all consuming at both public health departments and limited their ability to fully participate; however periodic status updates were provided throughout 2021. 18 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 French Hospital Medical Center In January 2022, a one-hour meeting was requested with SLOPHD to share the preliminary results of the community health survey and gather their feedback/input. On February 8, 2022, Dignity Health shared a presentation with SLOPHD that provided a status update of the CHNA process to date, shared preliminary results of the community survey, and requested their feedback/input. SLOPHD was complimentary of Dignity Health's ability to reach the most vulnerable population and agreed with the preliminary results. SLOPHD expressed their desire to collaboratively approach the implementation strategy. Following the adoption of this CHNA, additional meetings will be scheduled with SLOPHD. Written Comments from 2019 CHNA FHMC invited written comments on the most recent CHNA Report and Implementation Strategy both in the documents and on the web site, where they are widely available to the public. No written comments have been received at the time of the CHNA report development. Secondary Data Sources The CHNA includes a multitude of secondary data indicators that help illustrate the health of the community. Secondary data from local, county, state, and national sources were reviewed and includes data points about demographics, mortality, morbidity, social determinant of health, health behaviors, clinical care, health outcomes, and physical environment. A limitation of the secondary data was that it many times pulls from a larger geographic area that does not align with the demographics of the FHMC community. Additionally, not all secondary data was stratified by demographic characteristics, which limited the ability to identify health disparities. A multitude of primary and secondary data sources were evaluated and considered for this CHNA Report. The community health survey addressed COVID-19 and attempted to begin to document its impact to the community. Many secondary data sources are three to five years old and do not include the recent trends in health statistics including the detrimental changes in health due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This CHNA Report utilized the following secondary data sources, and, where possible, was compared directly to data collected during the community health survey providing a comparison of service area data to county, state, or national levels: California Cancer Registry; California Department of Education; California Department of Public Health; CDC Healthy People 2030; CDC Morbidity and Mortality; Center for Disease Control (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System; County Health Rankings and Roadmaps; San Luis Obispo County Public Health Department; and, U.S. Census. 19 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 French Hospital Medical Center All secondary data sources were thoroughly evaluated and every effort was made to use the best available data at the time of report publishing. While there are always data limitations, the assembled data, information, and analyses completed provide a comprehensive identification and description of significant community health needs. CHNA Report Preparers This CHNA report and the preceding data collection process was completed as a collaborative effort between Patty Herrera, MA, Manager of Community Health, Dignity Health Central Coast and Amanda Tamburro, MPH, Principal at Tamburro Consulting Group, LLC. Patty has been the champion of community health in Santa Barbara County since 1991. Patty has been responsible for the community health survey data collection process and compilation since 2016. Patty conducted the critical outreach to community partners and contracted and trained her staff, staff from Herencia Ind\u00edgena, and the promotores networks from San Luis Obispo County to conduct the health survey outreach. Patty also was responsible for managing the community health surveys collected and the data compilation. Amanda was responsible for data analysis and the report preparation. Amanda served as the primary author and lead researcher for the 2016 and 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment reports for Marian Regional Medical Center, Arroyo Grande Community Hospital, and French Hospital Medical Center. 20 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 French Hospital Medical Center V. Assessment Data and Findings The data assessment for this CHNA Report will consist of a systematic review of the primary and secondary data sources mentioned above. The data assessment will compare the community against county, state, and national levels, as well as Healthy People 2030 (HP 2030) benchmarks. Data will be analyzed for health and social inequities, health indicators, health behaviors, and health conditions. The analysis will specifically note population segments that are particularly vulnerable or experiencing disproportionate unmet health needs or poor outcomes. Social Determinants of Health and Barriers to Care According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the conditions of the places where people live, learn, work, and play affect a wide range of health and quality of life risks and outcomes. These factors include economic stability, health care access and quality, education access and quality, neighborhood and built environment, and social and community context; collectively they are known as the social determinants of health (SDOH). 8 SDOH contribute to a wide range of health disparities and inequities and are fundamental in assessing a community. Economic Stability Income influences all aspects of an individual's life, including the ability to secure housing, food, transportation, health care, and childcare. Income also impacts an individual's ability to maintain good physical and mental health. Employment status is linked to several barriers to care, including lack of health insurance, inability to pay for health care services and copays, and the inability to pay for transportation to health care appointments. According to the U.S. Census, American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates (2016-2020), one in eight people or 12.6% of California residents live in poverty. These individuals are less likely to have access to health care, healthy food, stable housing, and opportunities for physical activity. In San Luis Obispo County this number improves 11.1% of all residents live below the poverty level.9 In the FHMC community, the poverty rates range from a low of 4.0% in Templeton to a high of 40.4% in San Luis Obispo. According to the U.S. Census, only two zip codes 93401 and 93405 (SLO City) in the FHMC community are exceeding the state poverty rate of 12.6%. Overall, the poverty rate for the City of San Luis Obispo is 28.2%, or more than two times the state rate. 8 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2022.

The following figures depict the northern and southern FHMC community and the varying poverty rates based on census tract. It should be noted, this data source is not using the most recent U.S. Census data. The current community situation may have changed due to the lag in data and the COVID-19 pandemic. Figure 3.

Northern FHMC Estimated Percent of All People Living in Poverty (2015-2019) According to the 2022 community health survey, when survey participants were asked if they had over $300 in a savings account, 51.3% (n=199) of those residing in the community responded \"no\" to the question. Over half of the survey participants from zip codes 93405 (San Luis Obispo), 93422 (Atascadero), 93442 (Morro Bay), Robles) and 93465 (Templeton) do not have $300 in a savings account. Also, one-third of community health survey participants (32.3%, n=130) reported they suffered a loss of job/employment, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, 30.5% (n=123) said they have suffered from food insecurity/not having enough food, due to the pandemic The 2021 poverty guidelines published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, published a poverty guideline of $12,880 for a one person household and $26,500 for a family of four.10 While the official poverty measure primarily accounts for the cost of food, the Real Cost Measure (RCM), published by the United Ways of California, factors costs related to housing, 10 U.S. Health and Human Services, 2022.

According to their 2021 report, nearly one in three California households do not earn sufficient income to meet basic needs. Of the 33% that do not earn sufficient income to meet basic needs, 97% of these households have at least one working adult. The RCM data for San Luis Obispo County found 26% of households living below the RCM. In San Luis Obispo County, 38% of all households spend more than 30% of their income on housing. The United Way RCM report for San Luis Obispo County can be found in Appendix D.11 Education Access and Quality Education has been described as the most important modifiable social determinant of health.12 Research has shown that lower educational attainment levels are linked with poor health, more stress, higher poverty, and lower self-efficacy. People with higher levels of education are more likely to be healthier and live longer. According to the U.S. Census, the highest level of education for the population age 25 and older in the FHMC community was distributed as follows: 7.5% had less than a high school diploma or equivalent (or 9,075 individuals); 19.3% had high school graduate as their highest level of school completed; 36.3% had some college or an associate degree as their highest level of school completed; 22.5% had a bachelor's degree as their highest degree; and, 14.5% had completed an advanced degree such as a master's degree, professional degree or doctoral degree.13 The educational disparity increases as each zip code and race/ethnicity within the FHMC community is examined. According to the U.S. Census, the percent of high school graduates (25 years and over) in the State of California is 83.9% and in San Luis Obispo County it is 91.8%. The rate of high school graduates, age 25 years and over, in the FHMC community ranges from a high of 97.0% in 93465 (Templeton) to a low of 86.6% in 93405 (San Luis Obispo). However, further examination of high school educational attainment or higher, compared to an individuals' Latino(a) status indicates the Latino(a) population has lower educational attainment levels than their White alone, not Latino(a) counterparts. These educational attainment disparities are further depicted on the following table. 11 United Ways of California, 2022. The Real Cost Measure in California 2021.

Neighborhood and Built Environment The physical and built environment surrounding where an individual lives, learns, works, and plays are important to health. Access to the outdoors, commerce, public safety, public transportation, clean water, clean air, sidewalks, and parks all impact an individual's decision-making process to further their wellness. While local industry is a source of employment and feeds the local economy, it at times may impact the physical environment, potentially exacerbating or increasing the risk factors for chronic disease. According to the 2020 San Luis Obispo County Annual Crop Report the total gross crop value for 2020 was $978,675,000.17 In order to produce the high value crops to meet industry standards, in 2018 the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (CA DPR) reported that 3,055,467 pounds of pesticide were used to treat 1,498,665 acres in San Luis Obispo County. San Luis Obispo County was ranked 16th of all California counties for total pounds of pesticide applied.18 The Top 5 Pesticides used in San Luis Obispo County are listed on the following Table 7. 17 San Luis Obispo County, Department of Agriculture (2021). 2020 Annul Crop Report. https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/Departments/Agriculture-Weights-and-Measures/All-Forms-Documents/Information/Crop-Report/Crop-Report-Current/Crop-Report-2020.pdf 18 California Department of Pesticide Regulation (2022).

Mineral oil 192,282 One of the most commonly used pesticide by total pounds in the FHMC community is chloropicrin. Chloropicrin is listed by The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) as a lung damaging agent and is severely irritating to the lungs, eyes, and skin. Chloropicrin is used as a soil fumigant and historically was used as a chemical warfare agent (military designation, \"PS\") and a riot control agent. Chloropicrin (PS) has the characteristics of tear gas and was used in large quantities during World War I and stockpiled during World War II, but is no longer authorized for military use.20 Another commonly used pesticide in the FHMC community that is listed above is 1,3-dichloropropene. 1,3-dichloropropene has been classified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a probable human carcinogen-based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in animals.21 Aside from the over three-million of pounds of pesticides that were used to insure the production of quality agricultural products, the air quality in the San Luis Obispo County is impacted by wildfires and dust. The air quality in San Luis Obispo County in 2020 declined as compared to previous years as a result of historic wildfire impacts. Particulate concentration records for the county were broken with record highs measured on 10 days. The highest levels of particulate matter were recorded in Paso Robles and Atascadero in August 2020. Wildfire impacts also led to increased ozone concentrations in Past Robles and Atascadero exceeding state and federal standards in August 2020.22 According to the 2022 community health survey, 12.8% (n=51) of survey participants responded that they have been diagnosed with asthma.

According to the CDC, 9.1% of adults in San Luis Obispo County currently have asthma.23 Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of access to broadband internet was amplified and disparities in access were exposed. In the FHMC community, broadband internet subscriptions vary by geographic location and are presented in the following figure. As more health systems are using internet-based communication and health care tools, internet access is important to improve health and health literacy. The HP2030 objective is to increase the proportion of adults with broadband access to the Internet. Figure 6.

Social and community context can be evaluated through the following indicators: Discrimination; Incarceration and crime; Social cohesion and social connectedness; and, Community capacity. The FHMC community is home to a number of churches, schools, gyms, parks, senior centers, and farmer's markets that can be used by the community and foster community engagement. An example of the multitude of community organizations supporting the FHMC community are provided in Section 7. According to the voting records for San Luis Obispo County, nearly 88% of registered voters cast ballots in the 2020 presidential election.24 The violent crime rate is the measurement of homicide, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault that occur in a community compared to the total population. According to SLO Health Counts, the violent crime rate for San Luis Obispo County was 295.5 crimes per 100,000 people in 2020. This rate is below the state rate of 437.0 and the national rate of 379.4.25 Discrimination and bullying/teasing can have detrimental effects on an individual, especially students. One goal of HP 2030 is to reduce bullying of transgender students. According to the California Department of Education, between 2017-2019, 34% of 11th grade students in San Luis Obispo County reported being harassed or bullied in the past 12 months.26 Aside from having broadband internet access as discussed above, understanding health conditions and having needed health literacy to understand health conditions are indicators of social and community context. As individuals use computers to better understand their health conditions, having social support (family and friends) to talk with is also important and improve health navigation. 24 County of San Luis Obispo, 2020.

Inadequate health insurance coverage is one of the largest barriers to health care access, and the unequal distribution of coverage contributes to disparities in health. Out of pocket medical care costs may lead individuals to delay or forgo needed care (such as doctor visits, dental care, and medications), and medical debt is common among both insured and uninsured individuals. Vulnerable populations, including seniors, monolingual Spanish speaking, Indigenous, LGBTQ+, and homeless are particularly at risk for insufficient health insurance coverage; people with lower incomes are often uninsured and minorities account for over half of the uninsured population.27 The communities' ability to access health care was measured through multiple community health survey responses compared to secondary data. The qualitative survey responses identified access to health care and access to behavioral health care as the two greatest needs facing the community, including the youth population. Select details are presented on the following Table 8. Table 8.

Additionally, 13.1% (n=52) of 2022 community health survey participants reported they only have medical restricted, emergency, or pregnancy restricted Medi-Cal. A disparity exists between the community health survey completion language (Spanish versus English) and their health insurance status.

Lastly, of the survey participants that reported not having any health insurance (n=73), 78.1% (n=57) completed the survey in Spanish. An additional analysis of the health insurance status for survey participants, age 65 or younger (not eligible for Medicare), found disparities in the FHMC community with increased levels of survey participants with no health insurance or only emergency Medi-Cal: 73.4% (n=22) of survey participants from 93405 (San Luis Obispo) reported having no health insurance or only medical restricted, emergency, or pregnancy restricted Medi-Cal; and, 42.1% (n=64) of survey participants from 93446 (Paso Robles) reported having no health insurance coverage or only medical restricted, emergency, or pregnancy restricted Medi-Cal. The 2022 community health survey results for oral health align with 2019 FHMC CHNA results and are consistently below state and national rates. Approximately, only one out of every two (56.2%; n=223) survey participants reporting visiting a dentist in the past year. Survey participants that delayed getting medical care in 2022 cited cost as the primary reason, followed by fear of COVID-19. Mortality The most recent publicly available mortality data is from 2020, published by both the CDC and also the California Health and Human Services Agency. A review of the 2020 California mortality data, by the California Department of Public Health, revealed that after many years of decreasing death rates in California, the rate increased substantially (15.9%) in 2020, and continued to increase in 2021. This increase in deaths, or excess mortality, is due to COVID-19 and other causes of death. The excess mortality differed by race/ethnicity, with the greatest increase among the Latino(a) population. Compared to prior years, deaths increased 34.1% among the Latino(a) population, and 7.8% among Whites. As the year continued, excess mortality increased within all racial groups, and the disparities between groups increased.29 The following table lists the top five leading causes of death in 2020 for San Luis Obispo County. A full data table detailing total deaths and the age-adjusted rate per 100,000 for years 2018-2020 can be found in Appendix E. 29 California Department of Public Health, Fusion Center, 2021.

Heart disease and cancer can be attributed to approximately 42-43% of all deaths occurring between 2018-2020 in San Luis Obispo County. In San Luis Obispo County, accidents (unintentional injuries) were the third leading cause of death for the Latino(a) community (between 2018-2020).31 The top five leading causes of death for Californians between 2018-2020, were as follows: 1. Heart disease, 2. Cancer, 3. Alzheimer disease, 4. Cerebrovascular diseases, and 5. Accidents (unintentional injuries). One length of life measure is premature death, which is tabulated through the years of potential life lost before age 75 per 100,000 (age-adjusted). Secondary data for the years of potential life lost (YPLL) from 2017-2019 was available at the national, state, and county level. Overall, the State of California is considered the healthiest state in the nation for having the lowest years of potential life lost before age 75 (5,703 years), compared to the national rate of 7,337 years.32 The YPLL for San Luis Obispo County was 5,200 years.33 San Luis Obispo County's Health Status Profile Reports for 2019, as prepared by the California Department of Public Health, has been provided for reference in Appendix F.

Chronic diseases are defined as conditions that last more than one year and require ongoing medical attention or limit activities of daily living or both. Chronic conditions many times are caused by unhealthy or risky behaviors, such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity, and excessive alcohol use.34 Chronic conditions also encompass mental health conditions, including depression and anxiety. Heart Disease and Stroke According to the American Heart Association, cardiovascular disease can refer to a number of different conditions including coronary artery disease, heart attack, stroke, heart failure, arrhythmia, and heart valve problems. Heart disease risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, an individual's lifestyle, age, and family history. In 2020, diseases of the heart was the second leading cause of death in San Luis Obispo County. The community health survey included questions that are considered risk factors for heart disease and stroke. These indicators are presented on the following Table 10 and are compared to state and national levels. Table 10. Prevalence of Heart Disease and Stroke Indicators Heart Disease and Stroke Indicators 2022 CHNA (N=403) 2019 CHNA (N=380) 27.8% 32.3% 34 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (2018).

The community health survey asked participants (Q25) if they were ever told by a doctor they had diabetes, pre-diabetes, or gestational diabetes. Primary and secondary data sources were evaluated and presented on the following table. Table 11. Diabetes Prevalence Have you ever been told by a doctor you have diabetes? 2022 CHNA (N=403) 1.8% The community health survey revealed pre-diabetes rates four times the state level. Survey participants reporting a diabetes diagnosis in 2022 is below 2019 levels, but still above state and national levels. Cancer As mentioned above, in 2020 cancer was the leading cause of death in San Luis Obispo County. Aside from cancer screening tests, there are vaccines and healthy choices that can reduce an individual's risk of cancer, such as limiting alcohol and tobacco use, skin protection, maintaining a healthy weight, and physical fitness. Cancer disparities are thought to reflect the relationship of socioeconomic factors, culture, diet, stress, the environment, and biology. The poor and medically underserved are less likely to have recommended cancer screening tests than those who are medically well served. They are also more likely to be diagnosed with late-stage cancer that may have been treated more effectively if diagnosed earlier.37 According to the California Cancer Registry, between 2015 and 2017, 4,855 cancer cases occurred in San Luis Obispo County. The California Cancer Registry determined the crude rate of cancer for each county and then adjusted it for age, so that an \"apples to apples\" comparison 36 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Population Health (2022).

Further evaluation into the health insurance status of females age 40 and older revealed the following: For women age 40 and over with health insurance, 30.5% (n=33) did not receive their annual mammogram. The highest rates of women that did not receive an annual mammogram in each zip code can be found in 93442 (Morro Bay) (61.1%; n=11) and 93401 (San Luis Obispo) (57.9%; n=11). Community health survey participants over the age of 45 were asked about their colorectal screening habits and if they ever had a lifetime colonoscopy. Additional questions were asked of survey participants to determine if they ever were screened for lung cancer through a CT scan, as well as a prostate cancer screening question. The community health survey results related to cancer prevention have been tabulated and are provided on the following table. Table 14. Cancer Prevention Prevalence Cancer Screening Questions 2022 CHNA CDC BRFSS40 California U.S. Lifetime N/A N/A Health Behaviors Healthy behaviors can help reduce an individual's risk of developing chronic conditions and improve mental wellness. These healthy behaviors include maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding tobacco, limiting the amount of alcohol consumed, and physical fitness. The status of these health behaviors was measured through several community health survey questions. Obesity, Diet and Exercise Body mass index (BMI) for each participant was calculated based on self-reported height and weight. When BMI was calculated for the community health survey participants, over 71.8% of all 2022 community health survey participants responding to this question (n=340) had BMIs considered overweight or obese. BMI measurements that fall within the range of 18.5 to 24.9 are considered to be normal weight. BMI measurements between 25.0 and 29.9 are considered to be 40 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Population Health (2022).

Overall, 65.4% of community health survey participants reported participating in an exercise or physical activity at least three times per week. Smoking Community health survey participants were asked two questions related to their smoking habits. Survey participants were asked if they ever smoked on average at least one pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years, or two packs a day for 10 years. Overall, 10.4% or 41 individuals, out of 403, responded \"yes\" to this question. Furthermore, community health survey participants were asked if they used any of the following the products in the past 30 days, this includes cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, chewing tobacco, pipes, or smoking marijuana. Cigarettes were used the most, with 13.4% of survey participants saying they used cigarettes in the past 30 days. Over 9% of survey participants said they smoked marijuana and a lesser 5.7% said they used e-cigarettes or vape. According to the California Healthy Kids Survey, 25% of 11th grade students in San Luis Obispo County (2017-2019 data) reported currently vaping.41 Social and Emotional Wellness Social and emotional wellness includes our emotional well-being, psychological well-being, and social well-being. Social and emotional wellness is essential to a person's overall well-being. Intentional harm was ranked as the 10th leading cause of death between 2018-2020 in San Luis Obispo County.42 According to the CDC's 500 Cities and PLACES Data in 2019, 12.9% of adults in San Luis Obispo County reported their mental health was not good for more than 14 days in the past month.43 This secondary data from 2019 is not representative of the social and emotional impact on the community due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Over 30% of 2022 community health survey participants responded that they (or a member of their household) needed to talk to a health care professional about problems like stress, emotional problems, family, drugs, or alcohol. Research suggests that LGBTQ+ individuals face health disparities linked to societal stigma, discrimination, and denial of their civil and human rights. Discrimination against LGBTQ+ persons has been associated with high rates of psychiatric disorders, substance abuse, and suicide. According to the California Healthy Kids Survey most recent data (2020-21), 15% of 9th grade students and 19% of 11th grade students in San Luis Obispo County reported considering suicide 41 California Department of Education (CDE) (2019).

Prioritized Description of Significant Community Health Needs The significant community health needs identified for the FHMC community extend far beyond health and health care. Social factors, including education, employment status, income level, gender, and ethnicity all contribute to health inequities. According to the CDC, racial and ethnic minority groups throughout the United States, experience higher rates of illness and death across a wide range of health conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, asthma, and heart disease, when compared to their White counterparts.46 Health inequities are systematic differences in the health status of different population groups. These inequities have significant social and economic costs both to individuals and societies. Health inequities can be best addressed by setting a goal to attain health equity in the community. Health equity is the state in which everyone has a fair and just opportunity to attain their highest level of health. The significant community health needs were thoughtfully determined by the Dignity Health Community Health Education Department. Primary and secondary quantitative data, as well as the qualitative data and the anecdotal stories all pointed to the following priorities. The same concerns and needs consistently rose to the surface and were repeated time and time again. In accordance with Dignity Health policy, the following criteria were also utilized to evaluate the prioritization of community needs, including: Size or scale of problem (how many impacted), Severity of problem, Disparity and equity, Known effective interventions, Resource feasibility and sustainability, and Community support. Attaining health equity in the FHMC community will require addressing the greatest disparities and helping the pockets of the community that are facing a constant uphill battle with everyday life. The following paragraphs provide a prioritized list of the significant health needs identified through the CHNA. Priority 1: Educational attainment Educational attainment is one of the five social determinants of health, and low educational attainment levels are linked with poor health, more stress, higher poverty, and lower self-efficacy. Overall, 7.5% of the FHMC community (or 9,075 individuals) over the age of 25 did not graduate high school or equivalent. However, the 2022 community health survey found that 46 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2022. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Health Equity. Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/healthequity/racism-disparities/index.html. 40 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 French Hospital Medical Center 38.3% (n=154) survey participants reported they did not complete high school (or equivalent). In addition, nearly 20% (n=79) of survey participants reported they did not complete schooling beyond elementary school. The lowest levels of education found in the community health survey were found in the surveys completed in Spanish or Mixteco. According to the U.S. Census, the high school graduation rate (age 25 and over) for the FHMC community is below the state level of 83.9% in the following communities: 93402 - 71.8%. A review of parents' educational attainment for the different high schools in the FHMC community found 27.9% of 11th grade San Luis Coastal Unified students' parents did not finish high school. Children with less-educated parents are less likely to succeed in school, and they may not reach their full potential. Priority 2: Access to primary health care, behavioral health care, and oral health The need for an improvement in access to primary health care, behavioral health care, and oral health has been substantiated through primary data, secondary data, and HRSA. HRSA has designated Morro Bay (MUA/P ID: 06206) as a medically underserved community within the FHMC community. Mental health professional shortages were designated for Arroyo Grande/San Luis Obispo (HPSA ID: 7063481715). Even if the community was not struggling with documented shortages of health care providers and medically underserved areas, inadequate health insurance coverage is one of the largest barriers to health care access. The vulnerable populations within the FHMC community includes seniors, monolingual Spanish speaking individuals, Indigenous, homeless, and LGBTQ+ individuals. Many vulnerable communities are well documented as being either uninsured, or underinsured, and face limited providers willing to treat them unless they can private pay. In addition, some vulnerable populations may not have jobs that offer them paid time off, or sick time, to leave work and go to a middle of the day physician's appointment or preventative screening. If they do take the time off of work, they will lose their pay for the day or potentially their position. Many are faced with choosing between going to a doctor or keeping their job and feeding their family. Aside from difficulty in accessing all types of health care, the vulnerable populations and aging community struggle with navigating the health care system. The lack of educational attainment mentioned and language barrier creates a situation that many find intimidating and difficult to navigate. 41 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 French Hospital Medical Center Priority 3: Health promotion and prevention Heart disease and cancer are the leading causes of death at local, state, and national levels. As documented above, the most vulnerable members of the FHMC community struggle to access health care. If the vulnerable communities are struggling to access health care, they are less likely to understand their current health status and access preventative cancer screenings. Besides difficulty accessing health care, the vulnerable communities face increased risk for heart disease and cancer due to their social determinants of health. They face food insecurity and more often live in areas that have higher levels of pollution. In order to help the most vulnerable communities reduce their chances of developing heart disease, cancer, or another chronic condition, targeted upstream health promotion and prevention is needed. Therefore, health promotion and prevention is the third significant health need within this CHNA Report. Within the FHMC community, 57.0 % (n=228) of the 2022 community health survey participants had a lifetime cholesterol check. Meanwhile an early indicator for heart disease in 43.0% of survey participants is unknown. Another risk factor for heart disease is obesity. Overall 71.8% of the 2022 survey participants had BMIs that were considered overweight or obese. The 2022 community health survey asked multiple questions regarding survey participants' cancer screening history. Overall 65.1% (n=95) of female survey participants over the age of 40 reported receiving a mammogram in the past year. Community health survey participants over the age of 45 were asked about their colorectal screening habits and if they ever had a lifetime colonoscopy. Only 56.5% (n=118) of eligible survey participants reported having a lifetime colonoscopy. Lastly, good health requires proper. Nearly one-third of the community health survey participants reported (30.5%; n=123) reported having food insecurity/not having enough food, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 42 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 French Hospital Medical Center VII. Resources Potentially Available to Address Needs While potential resources are available to address the needs of the community, the needs are too significant for any one organization. Making a substantial and upstream impact will require the collaborative efforts of community organizations, local government, local business leaders, and institutions. San Luis Obispo County is home to a wealth of organizations, businesses, and non-profits, including colleges and universities. The resources potentially available to address the identified significant health needs includes the following organizations, facilities, and programs: Educational Attainment Catholic Churches San Luis Obispo County Public Library Prado 40 El Camino Homeless Organization (ECHO) United Way Cal Poly First 5 Center for Family Strengthening CAPSLO (Community Action Partnership of SLO County Boys and Girls Club People Self Help Housing Paso Robles Housing Authority Los Osos Cares Resource Center The LINK Access to primary health care, behavioral health care, and oral health Alliance for Pharmaceutical Access Community Counseling Center Community Health Clinics of Central Coast (CHC) Pacific Health Centers of the Central Coast Planned Parenthood of Santa Barbara, Ventura, and San Luis Obispo Counties, Inc.

Impact of Actions Taken Since the Preceding CHNA Following the 2019 CHNA Report and Implementation Plan, FHMC worked tirelessly to address the identified health needs. Since July 2019, FHMC provided $29,804,216 in community benefits, detailed in the following table. Table 15. FHMC Community Benefits Summary, FY20 and FY21 Period 7/1/2019 - 6/30/2020 7/1/2020 - 6/30/2021 Community Benefit Category Persons Net Benefit Persons Net Benefit Benefits for Poor Financial Assistance 1,666 $1,201,312 Community Community Totals for BENEFIT 32,992 $12,376,968 27,665 $17,427,248 In addition to addressing the identified 2019 community health needs, FHMC expended an unprecedented effort and focus on helping the community through the COVID-19 pandemic. When the stay home orders and COVID-19 restrictions began to be lifted, FHMC remained vigilant and proactive in collaborating with San Luis Obispo County Public Health Department, and accessing the needs of our community partners. Due the resurgence of COVID-19 and the Delta Variant, the bilingual COVID-19 Information line was reactivated and staffed by the FHMC Community Health with the focus of assisting those callers needing help obtaining a vaccine appointment. Bilingual vaccine public service announcements were developed and aired on the local radio stations and television stations. Ongoing collaboration efforts between San Luis Obispo County Public Health, Community Health Centers of the Central Coast, and Dignity Health's Community Education Department focused on developing COVID-19 vaccine education outreach to the Latino(a) population which resulted in the establishing mobile vaccine clinics in strategic neighborhoods in San Luis Obispo County. Besides addressing the unexpected impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2019 CHNA Report identified the following health needs: Access to primary health care, including behavioral health; Aging, more mature population; and Chronic disease and management. The following subsections provide select details and impacts from the various community benefit programs currently addressing each 2019 identified health need. Further information can be found in the most recent community benefit report. 45 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 French Hospital Medical Center Access to primary health care, including behavioral health Funded Accountable Care Communities (ACC) whose goal is to provide access to health care, medical prescriptions, and behavioral health care.

F or deta iled methodology, sit http://uni tedw aysca.or g/realcost.The Real Cost Measure (RCM) estimates the amount of income required to meet basic needs (the \"Real Cost Budget\") for a given household type in a specific community . The Real Cost Measure builds a bare-bones budget that reflects constrained yet reasonable choices for essential expenses: housing, food, transportation, health care, taxes and child care. If any results show blank values, that indicates the sample size is too small to illustrate Real Cost Measure results. Per our methodology , estimates with a cell size of greater than 5,000 are assumed to be accurate within +/-1% based on design factor analysis. Cell sizes less than 5,000 are suppressed.
