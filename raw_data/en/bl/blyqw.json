Foreword Andhra Pradesh's bifurcation in 2014 required the creation of a new capital - and presented a unique opportunity to draft a blueprint for a city that could be a model for urban development across India and around the world. To begin the journey from farmland to world-class city, more than 24,000 farmers and other land owners in 29 villages near Vijayawada and Guntur agreed to pool 217 sq km where the new capital will be built from the ground up. These forward-thinking community members, along with leaders from government and industry, share a vison: that Amaravati can set new standards of happiness, health, efciency, and inclusiveness for the country and the world. This would attract waves of talent, tourists, and investment to drive innovation, sustain economic growth, and increase every resident's prosperity and quality of life. This socio-economic master plan, over nine months in the making, will shape not only the city's vision, scale, infrastructure, and physical contours but also its liveability and therefore it attractiveness to residents and industry. The new capital city will be a place where children have more safe places to play, students have new chances to learn, commutes will be shorter, workers will accomplish more, the government will be more responsive and efcient, tourists will be entertained, investors will nd new opportunities, and cleaner industries will attract more leading players from around the world. This plan was not handed down by any central authority; its authors include not just the government but the land owners and farmers themselves who pooled their property, the government ofcers, leaders of local bodies, commissions including the police and leading experts from around the country and the world. With hundreds of years of collective experience across city development, master planning and engineering, the socio-economic master plan for Amaravati is the product of the best minds across disciplines coming together to create a truly distinctive city. Together, the experts and the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority have studied the world's most forward-thinking and best-planned cities along with the Andhra Pradesh region's unique needs and strengths. With a combination of careful planning, comprehensive evaluation and creative visioning, the foundation has been put in place to create /g82/g81/g72/g3/g82/g73/g3/g87/g75/g72/g3/g87/g82/g83/g3/g87/g75/g85/g72/g72/g3/g75/g68/g83/g83/g92/g3/g70/g76/g87/g76/g72/g86/g3/g74/g79/g82/g69/g68/g79/g79/g92 . This social-economic plan lays out the key elements about the city's evolution and the implications for building the new capital city. Like every plan of this scale, this is a work in progress conversation rather than an answer set in stone. As people and businesses move into the city, they will transform and shape this city and its evolution. Indeed, Amaravati's identity as the people's capital means that every resident will have both a voice in its future as well as a civic responsibility in its development. We urge everyone to join the conversation, and we offer our heartfelt thanks to the many who have already done so much to make the dream of Amaravati a reality.Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 8B. Executive Summary Nearly every great city began as a small settlement and grew slowly to meet the needs of individuals and families. Growth tended to be haphazard, since it rarely considered the needs of the community as a whole or future generations. Clean water, open spaces and other vital resources disappeared, neighbourhoods and roadways became overcrowded, and some of the most important businesses and skilled people moved away or failed to thrive, leaving poverty and unemployment in their wake. In recent decades, however, forward-thinking civic leaders began to take a more holistic view of what makes a city liveable and attractive to residents, visitors, investors and businesses. Research and experimentation have revealed new ways for communities, industries and governments work together to advance their common goals, including the health and happiness of residents and workers, and clean, sustainable economic growth. This report, the 'Capital City Detailed Master Plan' for Amaravati, builds on these new ways of thinking about what makes cities successful, desirable and 'smart'. Expert teams studied how the most successful cities around the world planned land use, transportation, industrial development and employment, affordable housing, green and blue development, tourism and entertainment, and infrastructure, from flood control and energy supplies to public parks and security. The teams also studied the Andhra Pradesh region's rich heritage and great strengths, from rich farmland and water supplies to skilled labour, and global trends in investment and demand for the unique products and services that the region might provide. The plan introduces the vision of Amaravati as /g82/g81/g72/g3/g82/g73/g3/g87/g75/g72/g3/g87/g82/g83/g3/g87/g75/g85/g72/g72/g3/g75/g68/g83/g83/g92/g3/g70/g76/g87/g76/g72/g86/g3/g74/g79/g82/g69/g68/g79/g79/g92/g3/g68/g81/g71/g3/g79/g68/g92/g86/g3/g82/g88/g87/g3 /g74/g85/g82/g90/g87/g75/g3/g68/g81/g71/g3/g71/g72/g89/g72/g79/g82/g83/g80/g72/g81/g87/g3/g76/g81/g3/g83/g75/g68/g86/g72/g86 , including world-class transportation infrastructure to speed commutes and reduce traffic, 1.8 million jobs and homes for 4.5 million people by 2050, a network of parks, ponds, riverfront promenades and other natural features for children, families and workers, state-of-the-art flood control and waste management systems, and the preservation of cultural and historical sites for locals and tourists alike. All of these efforts, undertaken in concert, have the potential to make the new capital of Andhra Pradesh the pioneer smart city of India on par with the most advanced cities in the world. This new economic powerhouse will create a range of good jobs, help residents upgrade their skills, and support the expansion of high-tech and knowledge-based industries that will compete at a global level, while sustainability and efficient resource management will help maintain the region's clean and green character. Affordable housing for all will improve the quality of life and set new standards for India and the world. The proposal also aims to capitalise on the region's rich heritage to create a unique identity for the new capital. The plan looks ahead to 2050 and beyond, with three main phases and reviews at least every five years to allow planning to shift as development unfolds and new opportunities emerge. 9 Executive summaryC. Context - The birth of Amaravati In February 2014, the state of Andhra Pradesh was bifurcated, creating a need for a new capital city. The Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act for bifurcation received the President's assent on 1 March, the 'appointed day' for the new States' formation was 2 June, and Amaravati was chosen as the capital on 1 September 2014. The foundation stone for the capital city was laid on 22 October 2014.1 Government of Andhra Pradesh enacted Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority Act, 2014 (Act.No.11 of 2014) for the purpose of Planning, Execution, Financing and Promoting the Capital Region and Capital City Area for the State of Andhra Pradesh. In G.O.Ms.No.253, MA&UD (M2) Department, Dated: notifying erstwhile Vijayawada, Guntur, Mangalagiri, Urban Development Authority Region In G.O.Ms.No.254, MA&UD (M2) Department, Dated: 30.12.2014, orders were issued, notifying area between Vijayawada and Guntur Districts on the Krishna River bank as Capital city In the G.O.Ms.No.255, MA&UD (M2) Department, Dated: 30.12.2014, orders were issued, constituting the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA) under the Chairmanship of the Hon'ble Chief Minister with others as members In the G.O.Ms.No.97, MA&UD (M2) Department, Dated: 23.04.2015, orders were issued, notifying the Capital City be named as \"Amaravati\". Amaravati is envisioned as an inclusive people's capital which is economically vibrant and self- sustaining, equipped with world-class social and physical infrastructure to create unparalleled opportunities.' Amaravati will likely be the largest greeneld smart city in India, with planned investments of more than INR 40,000 crore over 10 years. Spread across 217 sq km, the capital was founded with the support of more than 24,000 farmers who participated in the largest-ever consensual land-pooling initiative.2 The physical master plan with zoning and regulations for the Capital City and demarcation of government and private-owned land was presented on 24 February 2016. Land parcels of around 33,500 acres have already been pooled and the process of demarcating and conrming hand-over of farmer-owned plots is underway. Additional land of around 1,500 acres is planned to be pooled or acquired by end of November 2016. 1 Government of Andhra Pradesh 2 Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority, Andhra PradeshSocio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 10D. Socio-Economic Master Plan Methodology and importance of Socio-Economic Master Planning The Socio-Economic Master Plan (SEMP) includes the core strategy which will guide the development of the city across all facets in an integrated manner from vision and inception to infrastructure implementation and funding. The SEMP adopts a demand-driven approach: the social and economic needs of citizens will guide planning, create a distinctive value proposition with clear priorities, and align decision-making across stakeholders. The SEMP includes six interrelated elements: 1. A vision of the city and governing principles aligned with that vision 2. Economic strategy and job drivers including anchor industries and value propositions for each anchor 3. Projected growth of the city including jobs, population, GDP and land use 4. Infrastructure required to support growth and capital investments, including critical elements which will drive liveability, such as distinct retail, entertainment and dining facilities and social infrastructure 5. Funding strategy to ensure self-sufciency 6. Implementation principles for how the city will be operated and maintained. These elements are closely linked, with each influencing the next. The vision permeates all elements, aligning and coordinating decision-making in line with agreed-upon principles. Job-creation will be influenced by the economic strategy, and occupancy influenced by liveability, to determine the incremental population of the city. Infrastructure development will be nely balanced with this projected population to ensure facilities are ready in time for incoming and existing citizens. The capital investments required to build this infrastructure needs to be carefully planned and funded through a well-designed strategy to ensure nancial self-sufciency. The SEMP is the core strategy manual which will steer the development of the city and coordinate the activities of all stakeholders including the physical master planners, infrastructure planners, transport planners, city authority, municipal corporations, communication consultants, contractors, and so on.11 Socio-Economic Master PlanLessons from other city developments Research into more than 20 comparable development projects in India and globally, and experience in socio-economic master planning in more than 30 cities across the globe, informed the plan for Amaravati. (For details on some of these case studies, please see the appendix). Four main lessons emerged from the research and experience: 1.Across zones, success requires competitiveness and proximity to existing economic centres: Shenzhen's proximity to Hong Kong, Singapore, and Seoul was a key to its competitiveness - providing a critical source of economic activity and demand. For example, at Kalinganagar, the Tata brand was the key basis of competitiveness - allowing for a strong balance sheet, willing development partners, and baseline demand. 2.Anchor tenants are crucial to build a critical mass of economic activity: At Iskandar, developers got the brand if they could not get the tenant. Where name-brand tenants were unwilling to invest, lead developers took on risk by developing the projects on their own and signing management contracts with the name-brand companies to capture brand value. To illustrate, at Kalinganagar, a mega anchor tenant is the main source of economic activity and development - Tata guarantees demand for services via large employee base and coordinates infra and service provision from other private developers and providers. 3.Build only the infrastructure you need: In Kalinganagar, Tata builds infrastructure selectively, based on its importance to the township's overall success, such as employee housing, or those no one else will take on, such as roads and sewage treatment. This reduces the city's share of capital expenses from 100% to 15%. For example, Suzhou Industrial Park faced challenges arising from state led development that was not in line with market needs. Developers built high-quality infrastructure but could not convince tenants to pay higher rates, debilitating growth. 4.All infrastructure funding is long-term, although comes in different forms: At Iskandar, long-term public capital was structured to foster economic activity. 'Impatient capital' in the private sector leads to land sales and property monetisation, undermining zone development goals. In Suzhou Industrial Park, the local government is the investor, collecting taxes and funding social infrastructure. The developer avoids the costs of building and maintaining social infrastructure. Implementing the Socio-Economic Master Plan The socio-economic master plan provides long-term projections of growth in jobs, population and GDP, which drive investment decisions for infrastructure and determine the integrated nancial model of Amaravati. While implementation is based on these projections, civic leaders will have to review and rene the plan on a yearly basis depending on metrics such as area developed, area sold, absorption across residential and commercial built-up spaces and occupancy rates, and population increases. This will allow Amaravati to develop infrastructure and manage funding in a dynamic manner to maintain its nancial viability.1.

It also requires implementation o f urban planning guidelines to seed the evolution o f city into India's capital o f happiness, wellness and organic living. Amaravati will incorporate best-in-class standards for community spaces, green areas, schools, hospitals, public transportation, a ffordable housing, and other in frastructure during its master planning to make the city as liveable as Singapore. It will promote sustainable practices and implement guidelines to develop as a wellness capital for mind and body and become Asia's hub for organic food. This focus will allow the city to set clear priorities and make important trade-o ffs as development moves forward. The urban planning o f cities has a pro found e ffect on its residents' health and happiness. Amaravati plans to implement best-practice guidelines to promote overall well being. These guidelines will be developed based on extensive ur ban-planning research and proven success in leading ecological and liveable cities worldwide. Examples o f these guidelines which Amaravati city may aspire for are : Building farmers' markets in every community to encourage people to buy and consume fresh food and promote local produc e Providing excellent pedestrian experiences, wal king and cycling lanes across all roads, and high-quality pu blic transportation to discourage car ownership and use Making Amaravati the greenest city in India with roo ftop gardens, street landscaping, gree n government buildings, vertical forests, etc. Making Amaravati a wal kable city with wal king and cycling lanes across all roads1 Promotin g active and permeable street spaces with restaurants and stores with open seatin g and entrance s2 Banning plastic ba gs, synthetic pesticides and other sources o f pollution Encoura ging healthy food choices and discoura ging poor choices by limitin g access to junk foods, taxin g sugary bevera ges, etc .

To make the happiness and health vision a reality, six core dimensions to drive the planning and development of the city have been identied: 1.Economic powerhouse: As a national economic hub, Amaravati is expected to attract non-polluting high-value manufacturing and service industries creating 7-8 lakh jobs over 25 years with a GDP of INR1.2 lakh crore3. Growth opportunities will be created by providing a business-friendly environment and a distinct community centred around the vision of wellness, which could make the city a preferred location. The 'Made in Amaravati' brand will promise natural and community-friendly products which may be exported at a premium to serve the increasingly discerning consumers. 2.World-class infrastructure and connectivity: Amaravati and the surrounding region will feature state-of-the-art road, rail, air, sea and public transport networks to ease commutes and connect to economic hubs such as Vijayawada, Hyderabad, and Chennai. The city will be planned along proven urban planning principles to promote citizen well-being including creating active streets with open areas, pedestrian and cycling friendly pavements and social spaces which encourage interaction. It is planned to provide over 115 km of public transport corridors by 2050 and more than 650 km of road network by 2050. Two national highways, NH5 and NH9, will connect Amaravati to adjoining cities. The Ganavarram airport is planned to be expanded for international connectivity, supplemented in the long term with a new airport in Mangalgiri. A new port is proposed within 100 km at Machilipatnam or Vadarevu.4 3.Green, clean, resource efcient: A blue and green city, Amaravati will be environmentally friendly, with 25-30% of its area reserved for open spaces and recreation, including parks, public facilities, waterways, and ponds within a ve- to ten-minute walk. Amaravati is expected to preserve and make use the natural features of the region, including forest areas and more than 25 km of waterfront on the Krishna River. It will offer effective water, waste, power and storm-water management solutions. And it will aspire to be flood-resistant, with the goal of net-zero discharge. Organic farming practices will be promoted for food- products and cotton, with the aim of making Amaravati Asia's biggest organic-food hub within 25 years. 3 Based on preliminary projections of the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA) 4 Master planning for new capital city of Andhra Pradesh, APCRDA Socio-Economic People's Capital, Amaravati will be driven by the tenets o f inclusive growt h andhigh living standards for all. It will be planned with a goal o f '5-10-15': nomorethan 5 minutes to emergency facilities, 10 minutes to recreation and open spaces, and 15 minutes to wor k.

Benchmarks to measure implementation To translate this vision into action, Amaravati will trac k development across a comprehensive set o f quantitative smart-city metrics for in frastructure, liveability, inclusive development and environmental friendliness. They include : Social in frastructure such as access to healthcare and education : Amaravati will aim to have more than 40 beds per 10,000 population, 5-10 minutes response time to emergency healthcare and over 300 acres for public health facilities. The city will also o ffer 100% education coverage for schools with more than 75 square feet o f school area per student and allocate over 1,800 acres for primary education.5 Health and education are cornerstones o f any city, and are not only key to improving liveability o f local citizens but also critical deciding factors for migrants relocating to Amaravati. Transport in frastructure: Transportation has pro found implications for liveability, including reducing the carbon footprint and in frastructure costs. Amaravati will aim to provide more than 50% o f trip share through public transport including electric buses and trams. The city will have dedicated bicycle tracks with a width o f at least 2 m, one in each direction, on all streets with carriageways larger than 10 m. High-quality and high- frequency mass transport within a 10- to 15-minute wal king distance will be provided in areas with more than 175 persons per hectare .6 Utilities: There will be no water- or power-decient areas in the city, with 135 litres per capita of water assured per day. Smart meters are planned to be installed to monitor consumption and tiered tariff implemented to minimum wasta ge. All solid waste will be se gregated. 5 In line with benchmarks proposed in Government of India - draft conce pt note on Smart City Scheme, 3 December 2014 6 Master planning for new capital city of Andhra Pradesh, APCRD A Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 18 Just as hygiene and sustainability are essential for liveability, utilities are key to industrial and economic growth. For example, an unrelia ble grid power nearly dou bles power costs due to the costs o f generator power. Lack o f reliable utilities is o ften a disquali cation factor for investors. Technology:TT Amaravati will to o ffer 100% Wi-Fi connectivity with 100 Mbps internet speed.

Cars were banned from some central shoppin g streets as early as 1949, and the city made many advances in the decades that followed to kee p the historic town centre appealin g to residents and workers. In the 1970s, for exam ple, the town banned cars from almost the entire city centre and built 50 bicycle parkin g lots and an extensive tram system. Freiber g integrates development with transportation plannin g to create a 'city of short distances' for its 220,000 residents. Today, they use 420 kilometres of bike paths, and more than a third of households do not own a car. About 70 % of residents live within 500 metres of a tram sto p. In some residential areas , the streets do not have sidewalks ; instead , cars are limited to walkin g speed and must share the road with pedestrians, bicycles and children at play. Nei ghbourhoods feature green spaces with natural play grounds, streams and ponds, community gardens and wild areas. A communal forest covers more than 40% of the t own. The im plications are profound. Fewer cars mean less air and noise pollution, of course, but also that people get more exercise and talk to their nei ghbours more re gularly, buildin g a sense a community. To improve liveability, new housin g projects are built only after schools, transportation, shops and other infrastructure is in place. Each nei ghbourhood is desi gned with a distinct character and in put from residents to provide a uni que sense of place and communit y. 1 Freiburg city website, The International Making Cities Livable Council article titled 'Freiburg: City of Vision ' Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 20 Residents can grow their own food on 3,800 privately owned garden allotments. Each morning, Freiburg hosts one of the largest farmers' markets in Europe, and at least half of the sellers are local people selling their own produce. The market plays a key role in civic life. The city has made a range of innovations in sustainable energy, including solar, wind and hydro-power, and co-generation. It has also worked hard to keep water quality high, in part by using green roofs and permeable ground surfaces rather than asphalt. Property owners pay storm-water fees based on the share of their land that is not permeable. The town has become a centre of environmental education, and it hosts about 2,000 rms in environmental economics and research.

The goal is to create a destination where nature, lifestyle, business, education and industry converge into a global city. The city is planned based on the guiding thought of creating a 'city in a farm'. It aims to retain the strength of agricultural heritage complemented with urban development and focus on agro-based industries and research. To sustain economic growth and provide its 1.2 million people with clean air and water, education, healthcare, safety and jobs, Clark Green City is being developed based on nine 'big ideas': Environmental sensitivity: Blending with the local ecology and topography with green and blue networks and green building standards. Agro-urbanism: Incorporating green ideas, including an agriculturally themed community Integrated land use and transportation: Integrating land use and transportation in a compact city prioritising pedestrians and cycling Market-driven adaptation: Adjusting plans, as development unfolds, to adapt to changes in the marketplace and demand and supply Openness and inclusivity: Dening the spatial experience of the city to shape its identity Efciency: Exchanging information about city services and management in coordinated, transparent ways Resilience: Meeting the challenges of climate change and disaster management through response infrastructure and compliance to standards Smart governance: Building an IT backbone to helping people engage in governance and decision-making A view to the future: Building an integrated, investment- friendly and socially responsible city with a good quality of life in mixed-use 24x7 districts. Clark Green City will create 800,000 jobs and be home to 1,120,000 residents by 2040. It will focus on agro-based industries, high-value manufacturing, education, government, real estate, tourism and other services (R&D, BPO, etc.). 1 Clarke Green City website23 /g36/g80/g68/g85/g68/g89/g68/g87/g76/g16/g3/g50/g81/g72/g3/g82/g73/g3/g87/g75/g72/g3/g87/g82/g83/g3/g87/g75/g85/g72/g72/g3/g75/g68/g83/g83/g92/g3/g70/g76/g87/g76/g72/g86/g3/g74/g79/g82/g69/g68/g79/g79/g92The industrial area is strategically located with access to Clark International Airport, Subic Freeport, and the region. The design is meant to enable economic growth and diversication while advancing trade relations and spurring technological innovation. The master plan also includes a range of institutional facilities, such as sports and civic centres, a new University of the Philippines campus, an MIT-afliated research centre and a healthcare centre, all interconnected by open spaces. A commercial district is being built with a lively urban core, a scenic urban landscape with iconic structures, a large central park and mixed-use components to create a distinct skyline and identity. The residential area will include mix of building styles accessible to a wide range of income groups in a pedestrian-friendly 'live-work- play' environment. The city is planned to be resistant to both floods and earthquakes. The rail system will allow people to reach Clark New City and get around easily without cars; a bus system is under consideration. All city-wide public services will be managed in an efcient Integrated Operation Centre. Ground-breaking began on March 17, 2016, and development at Clark Green City is underway. The master plan includes commercial, residential and educational development around a large central park.24\u00a9 Surbana Jurong Private Limited Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati2. Anchor sectors for Amaravati Job-creation is critical in the develo pment of any city and can have a profound im pact on its character and evolution. Good jobs are fundamental to the well-bein g of citizens and to lon g- term develo pment. While vibrant cities host a multitude of industries from hi gh-end services to manufacturin g and support services, most of the world's great cities are leaders in only a handful of sectors. For example, Ban galore is renowned for information technolo gy and business process outsourcin g, and Mumbai is renowned for nancial services amon g multiple others. We refer to these as 'anchor sectors'. They seed economic develo pment to form the core around which a cit y's econom y evolves. Businesses in these sectors cater to demand not onl y from the immediate vicinity but also at a national or global level . In addition to anchors, Amaravati will re quire other industries critical to social infrastructure, such as schools, retail stores and dinin g. Other sectors may also be accommodated opportunistically to meet the needs of industry . While anchor sectors may be prioritised based on their growth potential, for example, and t with Amaravati's natural endowments , this does not mean an exclusion of other sectors. Amaravati aims to provide a favourable and welcomin g investment climate for all non - pollutin g sectors. 2.1. Approach and methodology to prioritise anchor sectors Amaravati can become a national economic powerhouse by evolvin g as a leader in seven to nine focus sect ors. M ore than 35 sect ors were evaluated on the basis of attractiveness and l ocal stren gth to determine nine focus areas for Amaravati. As a rst step, all sectors with pollution risks were excluded, alon g with sectors that could not become national or global anchors due to fragmented or localised demand. The most attractive sectors are those which achieve four ma jor outcomes : 1.Create more jobs per acre of land use d 2.Provide hi gher-payin g jobs that boost GDP per capita and overall well-bein g 3.Deliver greater social impact throu gh inclusiveness o f growt h 4.Are environmentall y friendl y with low emissions and zero harmful effluents. Anchor sectors for Amaravati 25The list was narrowed on the basis of each sector's t with Amaravati's stren gths - those most likely to give investors and businesses advanta ges over competitors in other locations. These advanta ges include the availability of talent, access to customers and raw materials, and existin g sector clusters. Usin g this methodolo gy, and based on quantitative metrics and consultations with more than 100 industr y leaders, nine most attractive sectors were chosen as focus areas .Exam ple criteri a Desired outcome Focus are aFigure 6: Desired outcomes for the Capital City were selection s /g402Enabling sectors related to labo r (e.g., education/skills training , labor laws, etc. ) Social impac t/g402Health metric s /g402Happiness metrics /g402Inclusiveness o f growth/g402Urban design w hichmaximiseswellbeing of citizens (i.e., healt h and happiness) /g402Sectors critical for inclusive gro wth (e.g., health, education, socia l security) /g402Enabling services critical for social trans formation (e.g., education) Environmenta l impact/g402Polluting index /g402Only to a llow in dustries hat are not \"severe ly polluting\" category /g402\"Greenin g\" major economic sectors (e. g., utilities, buildin gs)Boosting GDP/g402Income per jo b /g402Current or anticipated economic growth drivers (e.g., manufacturin g, services) /g402Focus on productive sectors, i.e ., higher GDP per jo b or acre land Figure 7: Nine sectors were prioritise dafter a tri Bureau; GOIMoEF guideline sIs the sector a non-polluting sector suited to be developed in an urban setting ?

Food Processing What is exciting about food processing in India Food processin g is a critical growth and employment en gine for India, Andhra Pradesh and Amaravati. The nation is a global powerhouse for a griculture and food processin g, rankin g fth overall in ex ports10, production and consumption, second in fruit and vegetable production (10% of world production ) and rst in terms of milk production (27% of world production )11. Generatin g more than INR 845 billion annually in 2012-13 (at 2004-05 prices), the food processin g industry grew at a compound annual rate of about 8.4% from 2008 to 2013, and is projected to grow by 15% in each of the next 5 years.12 India processes less than 2% of its fruit and ve getable products, compared with 70 to 80% in other developin g countries such as Brazil, Malaysia and the Philippines ,13 indicating a lot o f headroom for growth. Having identi ed food processing as one o f 25 critical focus sectors in the 'Make in India' campaign, the Government allows 100% foreign direct investment in automating processing for most food products. The Government has also announced a special corpus o f INR 2,000 crore in the nancial year 2015-16 in NABARD for extending a ffordable credit to food parks and processing units in these parks.14 Agriculture and food processin g provide more than half of the jobs in India. Food processin g is especially labour-intensive, creatin g 13% o f jobs - the most amon gst all manu facturin g industries .15 The sector generates 30-80 jobs per acre depending on type and level o f mechanisation o f food processing units .16Patan jali Food and Herbal Par k in Haridwar spans about 95 acres and is antici pated to provide direct em ployment for more than 7,000 people at full operation.17 Agro-based industries, such as food-processing parks, not only bring industry to rural areas but also improve farmers' access to the broader market, increasing their incomes . Andhra Pradesh, known as the 'Rice Bowl o f India', is a leading state for agriculture and food processing. It ranks in the top ve for the production o f rice, maize, tomatoes, sun flower, mango, sug arcane, jowar and pulses such as r arhar, tur and gram.r18Andhra Pradesh en joys a diverse climate with ve a gro climatic zones and 8.45 million hectares of net cultivable area and fertile river systems of Godavari, Krishna, Tun gabhadra, Vamsadhara and Penna. The combination of natural endowments and developed infrastructure, irri gation systems, utilities and manpower (for example, Andhra Pradesh has a 70% literacy rate, 58 a gricultural research stations and one su gar cane research station) make this a favoured state for food processors in the country .19 10Make in India FICCI re port (2015) 11 AP Food Processing Policy 2015-2 0 12 Make in India FICCI report (2015 ) 13 CII report - Promotin g Industry in Rural Andhra Pradesh (2012) 14Ministry of Food Processing Industries, India in FICCI report (2015 ) 16Press 17 Patanjali Food and Herbal Park, India, foodprocessing technolog y 18 Crop production statistics, Department o f Agriculture and Cooperation, Ministry o f Agriculture, GoI 19 AP Food Processin g Policy 2015-2020 Anchor sectors for Amaravati 31 With the region's many advantages, Amaravati can emerge as a hub for processing the top crops in the region including sugarcane, rice, tomato, maize and mango. It could focus opportunistically on other surplus crops including banana, lemon, brinjal, pulses, groundnut, coconut, and cabbage. In the long term, Amaravati is envisioned as a hub for new-age agriculture and food processing driving productivity improvements and innovations for India and Asia. The long-term goal o f the city is to emerge as the region's top destination for researc h and development, training an d implementation in progressive agricu ltural practices such as greenhouse farming, precision farming, vertical farming, fertigation, hydroponics and automation .

Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 32 Food processing segments and focus for Amaravati Food processing is typically segmented on the basis of product type and processing stage. The industry includes a range of archetypes and players depending on type of product and step in the value chain. Product type segmentation Processed foods can be divided into six major product families: 1.Grains and oil seeds: This largest segment in food processing generates revenues of about INR 355,000 crore in 2012, nearly half of the food processing industry.20 This includes production of staples such as flour, rice, grains, pulses, breakfast an annual rate of 16% from 2012-1721, this is a highly fragmented segment - organised players produce less than 20% of the sector's output, although their share should increase with the entry and growth of fast-moving consumer goods players such as LT Foods, Kohinoor, Bunge, Cargill, and ITC.22 Given the high availability of grains and pulses such as maize, rice, moong, urad, jowar, castor, and rice, this could be a strong focus segment for Amaravati. (Guntur is India's #3 district for maize, moong, #3 in India for Urad.23) 2.Packaged foods: Revenues in this segment, the second-largest in food processing, amounted to about INR 203,000 crore in 2012, or nearly 28% of food processing.24 Products include spices, snacks and savouries, ready-to-eat and ready-to-cook meals, and confectioneries including chocolates, biscuits and bakery items. As consumers earn more and have less time for shopping and cooking, the segment is estimated to grow by more than 15% annually from 2012-17.25 More than 30% of the sector is dominated by large companies such as ITC, Dabur, Britannia, and Mondelez. Proximity to raw materials and downstream contracted processors are advantages which make Amaravati an attractive destination for this segment. 3.Milk and milk products: With revenues of about INR 87,000 crore in 2012, 12% of the overall processing industry, the dairy sector includes pasteurised milk, milk powder, ice cream powder, condensed milk, infant foods, cream, butter, cheese, ghee , khoya , ice cream, kul and other dairy products26. Forecast to grow at 11% per year from 2012-17, the industry is expected to see growth in the consumption of packaged milk over loose milk for food safety and convenience.27 This sector is dominated by cooperatives such as Amul, Vijaya, and Verka. While AP ranks #1 for milk and milk products,28 the segment is classied as polluting or 'Red' under Government norms and may not be set up within city limits. 20 NSDC, MoFPI 21 Ibid. 22 Ibid. 23 Directorate of Economics Statistics, 2014-15 24 NSDC, 25 Ibid. 26 Processing Policy 2015-20 Anchor sectors for Amaravati 334.Beverages : Accounting for INR 55,000 crore in 2012, about 8% o f the industry, the beverages sector includes distilled alcoholic beverages, wine, beer, so ft drinks, mineral water and other non-alcoholic beverages .29 Non-alcoholic bevera ges are expected to grow at more than 16% annually, and alcoholic bevera ges by more than 8% annually, from 2012-17 .30 The sector is driven by changing consumer pre ferences towards juices and so ft drinks and the increasing availability o f international alcohol brands. Key players include PepsiCo, Nestle, HUL , Tata, and United breweries. With high mango and lemon production in the capital region (AP is #1 for mango and lemon, Krishna is #1 for mango, and Guntur is #2 for lemon31), hi potential for fruit-based bevera ges. 5.Meat and marine products: With revenues of about INR 25 ,000 crore in 2012 , or 3% of the industry, meat and marine products are expected to grow at about 17% annually from 2012-17 driven by chan ging dietary habits and increasin g exports .32This segment includes slaughtered, processed, preserved, sundried and canned mutton, bee f, pork, poultry and sh. Meat processing would not be permitted in the city, given the Government classi es it as 'Red'. While AP is the top producer for marine products and accounts for about 60 %33of national shrimp production, these units are clustered in coastal regions and there fore not focus segments for Amaravati. 6.Fruits and vegetab les:With revenues o f about INR 10,000 crore in 2012 or about 1.5% o f the food processing industry growing at 4% annually, this sector includes fresh fruits and vegetables, dry fruits such as raisins and cashews, processed and preserved fruits and vegetables (jams, jellies, pickles, sauces, pastes, juices, concentrates, potato flour, canned fruit and vegetables ).34 This hi ghly unor ganised se gment uses less than 10% of all produce comin g from or ganised players and only about 2% of processin g (vs. 65% in the US)35. Amaravati may focus on hi gh-value fruit and ve getable products (AP is #1 for tomatoes, Guntur #5 and Krishna #7 in production) and o pportunistic ca pture of other localised processin g demands (Guntur is #3 for sapota, Krishna ge).36 29NSDC, MoFP I 30 32 NSDC, MoFP I 33 Andhra Pradesh Food Processin g Society, Department of Industries & Commerce (FP), Government Of Andhra Pradesh 34 Ibid. 35 Grant Thornton, CII, Indian Food & Bevera ge Sector - The next wave, 201 4 36 Directorate of Economics and Statistics , 2014-1 5 Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 34 \"Amaravati's natural advantage is its location in a rich agro-belt\"Value Chain The a gricultural value chain has six basic links: 1.Pre-harv est activiti esinclude purchasin g seeds, pesticides, equipment and other inputs.

It is typically located outside city limits with only sales o fces in the city. Production and procurement and storage are localised activities in and around farmland. Similarly, retailing is localised around customer hubs. Since anchor sectors are those for which Amaravati is renowned at a national or regional level, these sectors may not be developed as focus anchors, although they may be developed as required . Amaravati should focus on food processing as an anchor segment due to the city's natural advantage given its location in a rich agro- belt. It can also attract value-added services by providing excellent commercial and social in frastructure for companies to set up o fces close to farmers . In terms of services to support food processing, the region is highly attractive - typical H Q ofce space includes 150-200 employees per acre, for example - and absolute employment per unit is small; a typical Dabur regional o fce employs 30-40 people .37 37 Industry Ex pert ConversationsFigure12: Value chain in food processin researchFarmers cold stora ge and silos Gradin sorting, milling, and packingSeeds, fertilisers , and farm equipmen t Retail sho ps, malls, cash and carryInputs Production Procure- mentand storage Process ing Reta ilingKey activiti es Food Corp. o f India NCML ITC Lt d.

Proximity to raw materials is critical for perishability and lo gistics reasons, and value-add per product is ty pically low. The out put ty pically re quires secondary and tertiary processin g prior to consumption. This may be a focus se gment in Amaravati for produce from Krishna and Guntur . b.Secondar y: This includes processin g primary produce to create in gredients such as pulp, flour, oil cakes, and slices. Proximity to raw material and primary processors is stron gly preferred. Output such as flour may be packa ged and sold or sent to tertiary processors. This may be a focus se gment in Amaravati for produce from Krishna and Guntur . c.Tertiar y: This nal sta ge of processin creates ready-to-consume products such as ketchups, confectionaries, and packa ged bevera ges. While proximity to raw materials is preferred, it is not always critical, as secondary processin g often increases shelf life. This is the hi ghest value-addin g stage for most food products, given that it is typically done by FMCG brand owners which demand a premium. Given the low de pendence on location and higher dependence on other benets such as scal incentives and excise breaks, Amaravati may focus on this sector o pportunistically with increased em phasis on com panies in focus segments (e. g., Parle A gro for Frooti production). In summary, from a product-type se gmentation, Amaravati can focus on grains and oil seeds, packa ged foods, bevera ges, fruits and ve getables. From a value-chain se gmentation, Amaravati can focus on primary and secondary processin g. Anchor sectors for Amaravati 37 \"Growth in global demand should continue, fuelled in part by rising incomes and populations in developing economies.\"Key trends driving growth in this sector Demand fundamentals coupled with policy reforms driving growth of about 15% by 201738 Demand trends within India and internationally, along with supply-based reforms, are driving growth in the food processing sector. 1. Policy support The Government has released multiple schemes which provide nancial incentives, encourage foreign direct investment (FDI) and promote infrastructure39: 100% FDI is permitted automatically for most food products, except for items reserved for micro and small enterprises Mega food park schemes announced in 2008 provide one-time capital grants of 50% of project costs (excluding land) to a maximum of INR 50 crore The Government offers tax incentives and other sops such as excise duty exemptions for equipment used in cold storage facilities Regulators are transitioning towards implementing international quality standards, especially for exports and in sub-sectors such as meat and marine products, grains, and oilseeds. 2. Improved access to credit This sector has been given priority status for credit to promote entrepreneurship and investment, including: A special fund of INR 2,000 crore has been included in 2015-16 NABARD budget to provide affordable credit to agro-processing units40 Reserve Bank of India has classied loans to food and agro-based processing units and cold chain under agricultural activities for Priority Sector Lending subject to aggregate sanctioned limits of INR 100 crore per borrower.41 3. Robust domestic demand Consumption is growing in India as the number of consumers grows and their preferences change. The country has the world's largest youth population, for example, with about 572 million people under the age of 24, and they are more willing to try new processed foods.42 Food is more affordable, and household incomes are rising. As more women enter the workforce, families have more money but less time for shopping and cooking, creating a growing market for processed and premium foods. Meanwhile, people's increasing 38 NSDC 39 Make in India, Government of India 40 Ministry of Food Processing Industries, India (MOFPI) 41 Reserve Bank of India 42 Make in India, Government of India Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 38awareness of health and nutrition are fuellin g demand for premium products such as organic foods. 4. Bour geonin g export opportunitie s From 2011-15, exports increased at about 23% per year to rou ghly INR 145,000 crore to key buyers in re gions such as the Middle East, the Americas and Southeast Asia .43 This growth has been aided by improving standardisation and quality in food processing and packaging. Favoura ble supply-side dynamics include competitive production costs compared to other Asian and developing countries, India 's strategic geographic location, and its a bundant raw materia ls. Growth in global demand is likely to continue, fuelled in part by rising incomes and populations in developing economies. The Government can support this growth with incentives to the private sector. For example, it has exempted export earnings from corporate taxes and set up 60 Agricultural Export Zones across the country .44 5. Increasing organisation and changing industry structure The food processing sector is becoming more organised with the movement towards consolidated and integrated farming, which improves productivity per acre with more sophisticate d and automate d systems an d mac hinery. Organised retail accounts for only about 7% of the entire Indian retail sector, but this is increasing with the liberalisation o f FDI and the emergence o f players such as Bharti- Walmart, Future Retail, and Aditya Birla Retail.45 43IBEF Report, Food Processin g, 201 5 44 Ibid. 45 NSDC Report, Retail Anchor sectors for Amaravati 39 \"If executed well, food-processing parks can have a sizeable impact on job-creation and agricultural productivity.\"Top needs in food processing and how Amaravati can meet them Food processing players across segments and the value chain expect an IRR o f 10-15% on average, with brand owners extracting a more than 25 %.46 To o perate effectively and meet these IRR requirements, players select locations based on their needs alon g six dimensions: 1.Proximit y to raw materials: The availability of produce is critical in terms of perishability and lo gistics costs. A gricultural zones or parks often fail to offer availability of the required agricultural produce, both in terms of quantity and quality, within a 100 km radius o f the facilit y. With a location in the heart of South India's a gricultural belt, Amaravati offers si gnicant advanta ges to food processors. Krishna and Guntur are the top districts in India for valuable produce includin g dry chillies, maize, and man go. 2.Fiscal inc entives: In addition to GoI incentives , state incentives and SEZ status have the highest impact on overall costs and are therefore the most important factors for food processin g majors. While AP offers a competitive policy, it faces competition from other emerging states with a ggressive scal policies. Madhya Pradesh, for example, provides customised scal incentives for project investments. This is facilitated by the state's sin gle- window investment clearance body Trade and Investment Facilitation Cor poration Limite d and approved throu gh a fast-track APEX Level Committee headed by the Chief Minister .47 How incentives are granted is an important consideration. For example, most business leaders pre fer up front discounts rather than reimbursements as the latter can be time- consuming and require managerial bandwidth . Andhra Pradesh is competitive in terms o f scal incentives o ffered to food processors. Key elements o f the policy include additional subsidies o f 50% o f food park project cost 46 Industry ex perts 47 Industrial Promotion Policy, MP, 2014 Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 40 (up to INR 20-50 crore ), 75-100% reimbursement of net VAT/CST/SGST for 5-7 years and 100% reimbursement o f stamp duty .48 Fiscal incentives will need to be comparable to those of regional competitors to establish food processing at Amaravati . 3.Operational costs : Labour and utilities each account for 40-50% of total costs. They vary based on factors such as cost of livin g and access to grid power. For example, power from diesel-fuelled generators costs more than twice as much as grid power . The region has moderate to high labour costs, with a minimum wages from about INR 200300 per day, versus states with minimum wa ges under INR 200 such as Goa, Assam, and J &K. Power costs are com petitive, however, and su pply is reliable com pared to other states due to a power sur plus.49 The capital city is committed to supplyin g 24x7 quality power with an allocation of 1,000 me gawatts from the Vijayawada Thermal Power Plant .50 4.Infrastructure qualit y: Well-develo ped infrastructure in the form of reliable utilities, well- connected hubs and shared services may reduce overall operational costs by minimisin g disruptions, ensurin g access to markets and achievin g economies of scale. Uninterrupted water and power supplies are critical, for example, as water-tanker and generator costs are typically double those of grid supply. Reliable roads, rails, airports and seaport capacity ensure that goods may reach downstream processors and markets. Shared infrastructure, such as cold stora ge facilities, warehouses and packa ging hubs reduce upfront capex for players and provide scale benets. World-class infrastructure will give Amaravati advanta ges. It is planned to offer year-round water from the Krishna River, for example, and assured power supply given earmarked capacity from Vijayawada, which should reach 1,800 me gawatts in the medium term after a capacity ex pansion. The city will be well-connected to the nearby metros of Hyderabad, Bangalore and Chennai, with two major national hi ghways (NH4 and NH9), an airport, the second-lar gest rail junction in Vijayawada, and the seaport in Kakinada, about 300 km away.51 48State Department Policie s 49State IBEF Re port new capital city of Andhra Pradesh, APCRDA 51 Ibid.

Andhra Pradesh is considered a business-friendly state and was the rst to im plement single-window clearances. The World Bank ranks it second in the country for ease of doin g business.54Amaravati is committed to providing best-in-class ease o f business required by food processing investors including ready-to-occupy plots with environmental clearances, and single-window support within prede ned timelines. How Amaravati can avoid the pitfalls that caused most food parks to fail across India If executed well, food-processin g parks can have a sizeable impact on job-creation and agricultural productivity. These parks provide considerable scale economies, allowin g tenants to increase productivity by more than 400%. Despite these factors, only ve me ga food parks have succeeded of the 42 sanctioned as per the national Government's scheme .55 Four main issues have hindered their progress : 1.Land acquisition challenges and delays in statutory approvals from the state government : Food par ks required more than 50 acres, but given small parcel sizes across multiple farmers, food processors incurred high transaction costs and legal delays in acquiring land. State-specic strict land ceiling and sub-leasing laws limited how much would be acquired and prevented subleasing in certain states. For example, Kolkata-based Keventer Group got approval in November 2011 for a 50 acre food park in Bhagalpur, Bihar. Despite paying the government in full for the land, it could not get possession due to protests and lack o f state and government support. Approval was cancelled in June 2014 .56 2.Speculative buyers with no intention to o perationalise : The scheme attracted develo pers who were interested in obtainin g low-cost land with the INR 50 crore grant, gettin g permission to chan ge the land use from a gricultural to industrial and waitin g for prices to appreciate. These developers did not intend to build businesses in the parks, resultin g in more than 17 license cancellations by the government . 54 DIPP W orld Ban k Assessment 55 Business Today,'Not a walk in the park ' 56Business Standard 'Keventer exits from Bha galpur me ga food park project ' Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 44 \"Amaravati's long-term vision is to emerge as Asia's biggest hub for organic produce.\"3. Availability of raw materials in catchment area: Many food parks and clusters were set up without considering the availability of critical raw materials in the vicinity. Some also lacked infrastructure, which further conned the catchment area and limited growth. 4. Costs for tenants and food park developers: Rents are often two to ve times higher in food parks than in adjoining areas due to infrastructure facilities offered. While productivity benets may far outweigh rental costs, small food processors have been reluctant to move to parks. Additionally, banks were not familiar with the food park business model and routinely charged higher interest rates for nancing in parks than for individual units. Srini Food Park, for example, secured nancing at 12-16%, whereas most food processing units can borrow at 9%.57 Much can be learned from the pitfalls faced by delayed food processing projects across India, as well as from success stories such as Srini Food Park, Patanjali and Sri City. While Amarvati has the advantage of proximity to raw materials, it could also provide developers with encumbrance-free land as part of the master plan, establish strict evaluation criteria for selecting food processing and industrial park developers, develop excellent connectivity infrastructure to source raw materials as link to export markets, and offer a compelling economic proposition in terms of capital and operating expense savings.58 Implementation plan for Amaravati In the short and medium term, Amaravati aims to promote ecological farming practices while offering high-quality infrastructure at competitive rates To build a vibrant hub for food processing, Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority plans to explore the following implementation ideas and requirements: Establish organic farming practices: As the wellness capital of India, Amaravati will promote ecological practices such as organic farming, which relies on natural fertilisers, pesticides and seeds, avoiding or excluding synthetic inputs. For example, relying on crop rotations, manure and biofertilisers to replenish soil nutrients and introducing insect predators or natural pesticides such as rotenone or pyrethin to prevent pests. Effective organic farming offers healthy produce which may contribute to well-being of local consumers and can be exported at a premium - all while maintaining productive yields. Create a food processing hub with shared infrastructure within the industrial park: The city could establish ready-to-occupy plots for small, medium-sized and large business across primary, secondary and tertiary food processing. The park could provide top-class shared infrastructure including central processing centres, 24x7 utilities, warehousing and cold-storage facilities, transport solutions and linkages, R&D labs and effluent treatment plants. This would benet food processors by reducing upfront capex and ensuring reliable operations with minimal disruptions, in addition to facilitating efciency through economies of scale with shared facilities such as storage and packaging. 57 Business Today, 'Not a walk in the park' 58 Ibid.

It could focus opportunistically on other surplus crops in re gion includin g banana, lemon, brinjal, pulses, groundnut, coconut, and cabba ge. Develop sector infrastructure includin g cold chains and warehousin g: One of the bi ggest challen ges faced by the food processin g industry in India is the lack of quality infrastructure includin g road-rail access, cold chain facilities, warehousin g capacity and packa ging facilities. This need for reliable infrastructure and lo gistics is an emer ging investment opportunity for local entre preneurs and national players to set u p in Amaravati for food parks, cold chain lo gistics and third-party lo gistics. Amaravati aims to promote public / private partnershi ps to attract further investments. Promote Amaravati as a hub for modern trade sourcin g:Only about 7% of India's retail sector is or ganised59, but this proportion is growin g rapidly with relaxation of FDI limits in modern trade. Amaravati can attract emer ging retailers not only to set up operations but also to source products. Given the new population base expected to emer ge in the new capital city and its proximity to adjoinin g metros Hyderabad, Chennai and Ban galore, it can develop as a sourcin g hub for or ganised retail in the south. This could be facilitated by settin g up terminal markets for fruits and ve getables and facilities for sortin g, gradin g, packin g and coolin g. The city can also explore launchin g online marketplaces and exchan ges for food and food products to improve efciency in the supply chain and drive value for producers. Improvin g productivity of local farmers: Althou gh India is a global a gricultural powerhouse, yields are 10 to 50% lower than Asian avera ges. For example, in case of rice production, India avera ges at 2.3 tonnes per hectare versus China has a yield rate of 4.7 tonnes per hect are.60 A lar ge body of academic research has hi ghlighted the vital role of a gricultural productivity and food processin g in reducin g poverty in developin g countries. Amaravati will adopt a variety of measures to improve farmers' productivity includin g improved access to credit, trainin g programmes and research and implementation of precision farmin g - the latest practice of tailorin g the use of seeds, fertiliser, equipment, and processes to hi ghly site-specic conditions. Focus on value-added and pro gressive farmin g services: Amaravati can offer an ideal incubation hub for cuttin g-edge research and applications of pro gressive farmin g techniques. It may promote greenhouses, for example, to provide hi gh-quality controlled output critical for food processin g majors. Amaravati can promote research and on-eld dissemination of best-in-class pre- and post-harvest production methods 59 NSDC Re port, Retai l 60OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 201 4 Anchor sectors for Amaravati 47including hybrid seeds, organic farming and investment in irrigation. Amaravati can also opportunistically target food processing companies to set up national headquarters, regional ofces and R &D centres in the city. While these services jobs are highly attractive, with nearly 200 per acre, the overall scale o f employment is low. These measures will pave the way toward Amaravati's long-term goal o f becoming a capital for agriculture and food processing and a mecca for cutting-edge developments in this sector, not only for India but also internationally . In the long-term, Amaravati can become Asia's hub for organic food and new-age agro practices Raising the productivity and per formance o f these sectors, including food processing, is the most direct route to addressing poverty as it increases the income o f farmers and provides employment opportunities in agro-based enterprises. There is much room for improvement, as agriculture has not kept pace with recent growth in India's broader economy. Amaravati's long-term vision is to emerge as Asia's biggest hub for organic produce, a fast-growing segment globally due to increasing health-awareness. 'Made in Amaravati' is envisioned as a brand which would be renowned for unadulterated natural food products been grown and processed using organic practices. In the long run, the city plans to help farmers transition to 100% organic farming practices without any synthetic fertilisers or pesticides or genetically modi ed seeds. It aims to provide much-needed support to the livelihood o f farmers through maintaining strong yield with higher-value produce which may be exported at a prem ium.

Crop yields in India remain well below potential due to a number of structural factors: low investment in agricultural infrastructure, research, and extension services; an inefcient land ownership model; and market distortions that discourage productivity-enhancing investment. Bringing India's yields in line with those of other emerging Asian countries could reduce the population below the Empowerment Line by 10% points, raising more than 125 million people above the line.61 In addition, the ripple effects of agricultural growth are felt beyond the farm sector. As farmers earn more, they demand more consumer and durable goods, bolstering India's expanding manufacturing and service sectors. With this context in mind, Amaravati plans to build an ecosystem that attracts top talent and drives cutting-edge research and implementation. The aim is to rethink and transform the entire value chain from pre-harvesting to processing and packaging with the dual goals of higher productivity and healthy produce. Promising research areas which Amaravati could explore include: Vertical farming: Farming can occur indoors in vertically stacked structures or buildings with articial light, temperature controls and water supplies. This practice allows the highest quality control and provides opportunities for new product classes within foods. In Japan, for example, vertical farming has been applied in Fukushima for consumers concerned about radioactivity. Only a handful of other commercial vertical farms are operating so far, such as the world's rst commercial vertical farm in Singapore. Developed by Sky Greens Farms in 2012, it is three stories high.62 Fertigation and chemigation: Fertilisers, pesticides, herbicides, and irrigation can be applied more scientically to control dosage and improve absorption. Hydroponics, aeroponics and aquaponics: Plants can be grown without soil, in water or using airborne moisture, and aquaponics combines hydroponics with symbiotic aquaculture of sh or prawns. Precision farming for small farm owners: Precision farming, which provides specic feedback about inputs and practices through monitoring of local conditions, has been applied in its true sense only on large commercial farms. Innovations that would allow small farms to apply these practices in a cost-effective manner would be game-changing. Industry 4.0 for the farm: The internet of things - an interconnected web of sensors, computers and equipment - is improving decision-making and automating tasks in many industries, including agriculture. Equipment major John Deere has made inroads into this technology and offers GPS-controlled self-driving tractors, for example.63 61 McKinsey Global Institute, 'India's path from poverty to , Permaculture Report 63 Fortune 'Meet sectors for Amaravati 49CASE STUDY: HIGH-TECH FARMING YIELDS BETTER STRAWBERRIES, HIGHER PROFITS AND GOOD JOBS1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Bad weather has bedevilled farmers for millennia. Greenhouses provide controlled environments that consistently boost yields, but they're expensive to build and run, especially if they require air conditioning. The Japanese International Cooperation Agency is overcoming those challenges in the Pune district with indoor, digitally controlled strawberry cultivation. The berries are sweeter, they can be harvested all winter, and customers pay much more: INR 500 per kg. Sensors in the greenhouses monitor pH, temperature and moisture, while computers gather data and track growth. The farmers use a retractable curtain with mosquito netting at night and in the winter to maintain temperatures with minimal air conditioning. And instead of soil, the strawberries grow in coco peat, a cheap by-product widely available in India that minimises diseases, pests and the need for pesticides. After a pilot proved that the technology could work in Pune, the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA), with the help of NEC Corporation and an NGO, the Institute of Cultural Affairs, built a half-acre greenhouse which yielded more than 22,000 kg of strawberries in its rst season. Over half of the prots went to corporations formed by the rural women who manage the farm. JICA has provided a grant of more than INR 2.6 crore to scale up the project over two years and train local farmers to build and run the greenhouses themselves. Construction costs are high at INR 70 lakh per hectare, but the greenhouses become protable once yields reach 500 grams per plant\u2014a goal that seems to be in sight. Investors are expressing interest in partnership: they would contribute capital while the farmers provide land. Since the greenhouse system requires little hard labour, it can provide new employment opportunities for vulnerable groups including women and people with disabilities in rural areas. 1 Financial Express 'Pune adopts Japanese model to grow strawberry in controlled conditions' 2 Times of India 'Tech-based strawberry farming creates jobs for women' ; 'Japanese company to help grow soil less strawberries' 3 Indian Express 'Strawberry farm in talegaon remotecontrolled from Japan' 4 Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority 5 Japan International Cooperation AgencySocio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 50 Anchor sectors for Amaravati 512.2.2. Electronics Overview At a nascent sta ge in the 1960s, the Indian electronics sector was restricted merely to maintenance and development of fundamental communication systems relatin g to radio broadcastin g, telephonic and tele graphic communication, and au gmentation of defence capabilities. After government introduced reforms in 1991, the sector got the much-needed push, and today it is cited as one of the sunrise industries in India and with tremendous growth potential. India is now one of the fastest- growin g markets globally for electronics, with demand pro jected to reach INR 900,000 crore by 2020.64 Industry Growth and Segments Domestic for electronics goods has grown at by about 15% each year since 2010, to INR 500,000 crore.65,66 For years, more than 60% o f demand has been met by imports despite persistent e fforts by the industry and the government to support local manu facturing. Exports o f electronics goods and equipment are relatively small - around 15-25% o f the domestic manu facturing - due primarily to technological improvements and cost competitiveness in regional mar kets.67 64 Annual Re port 2015-16, De partment of Electronics & IT, Government of India 65 Ibid. 66 Human Resource and Skill Requirements in the Electronics & IT Hardware Sector, National Skill Development Corporation - KPM G repor t 67 NITI Aayog Strate gy for Electronic :Annual reports o f Department o f Electronics and In formation Technolo gy (DeitY), Ministry o f Communications and In formation Technolo gy; NSDC-KPMG report on Human Resources & Skill Development in the Electronics & IT Hardware Sector 2013-17,2017-22150-200 Average jobs/acr e Averageunit size (acres)75-100530GDP per 2013 )2.4Jobsmultiplier (direct pply chain onl y) Employee s (million, 2013)4.3Key statsINR'000 crore % of total domest ic mar ket 47% 61% 8%The Electronics sector in India can be categorised into the following segments68: 1. Consumer electronics The consumer electronics (durables) sector continues to be the main-stay, contributing about 32% of the total electronic hardware production. The urban consumer durables market is growing at an annual rate of seven to 10%, the rural durables market is growing at 25% annually.69 Some high-growth categories within this segment include mobile phones, TVs and music systems. 2. Computers With sound macroeconomic condition and buoyant buying sentiment, Personal Computer sales, including desktops and notebooks, sales declined to 10.6 million units during 2014-15.70 The decline in PC sales is attributed to increased consumption of smart phones and tablets by rst time buyers. Consumption is signicant in small and medium-sized enterprises and smaller towns and cities. Observers expect that the Government's keener focus on pan-India deployment of broadband at one of the lowest costs in the world will likely lead to accelerated PC consumption in the home market. The growing domestic IT market has now given impetus to manufacturing in India. 3. Control, Instrumentation and Industrial Sector This is now a mature sector in the country at least as far as application segments are concerned. State-of-art and reliable SCADA, PLC/Data Acquisition systems are being applied across sections of the process industry. The latest AC drive systems from smaller to very high power levels also nd application in large engineering industries like steel plants and metal industries. World-class UPS systems are being manufactured in the country to cater to the emerging digital economy. However, there appears to be no manufacturing base in the country for the whole range of the latest test and measuring instruments, which are invariably imported. Many Indian companies in the control and instrumentation sector can acquire orders for export systems through international competitive bidding, but the knowledge base in the country through industrial R&D in this critical sector has not been improving as desired. The industry needs R&D to serve the global market. 4. Communication and broadcasting The telecommunication industry has gained tremendous recognition as the driver for all- around development and growth. With more than a billion telephone subscribers, India has emerged as one of the largest markets in the world and second-largest in Asia.71 The private sector drives more than 57% of telecom industry revenues, and mobile telephony now represent 63% of revenues.72 Teledensity in India currently stands at just under 80. Broadband connectivity holds tremendous potential in the country as the Government of India has set a target of 600 million broadband subscribers by 2020.73 India has emerged 68 Annual Report 2015-16, Department of Electronics & IT, Government of India 69 IBEF Report, Consumer Durables 70 Economic Times, 'India PC market dip for 1st time as smartphone, tablet sales zoom' 71 Telecom Regulatory Authority of India 72 Ibid. 73 National Telecom Policy, 2012, Government of India Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 52as the second-largest market for mobile handsets.74 Following the unprecedented growth in the mobile market, a number of companies are planning to set up production for mobile handsets to meet local demand and serve export markets. Direct-to-home broadcasting has gained popularity, with more than 85 million subscribers as of May 2016.75 5. Strategic electronics The strategic electronics segment consists of Military Communication systems, Radars and Sonars, Network Centric systems, Electronic Warfare systems, Weapon systems, Satellite-based Communication, Navigation and Surveillance systems, Navigational aids, underwater electronic systems, infra-red based detection and ranging system, disaster management system, internal security system etc. The Indian strategic electronic industry is dominated by BEL and has some contribution from DPSU's such as HAL, ECIL and BDL. The estimated market for strategic electronics in India is about 33,500 crore.76 6. Electronic components The Indian electronic component market is dominated by components like electromechanical components (like relays, switches etc.) with 29% share, passive components (like capacitors, resistors, etc.) with 24% share. Further Active components (like ICs, Diodes, Transistors, Picture Tubes, etc.) and the Associate Components (like optical disc, magnets, RF Tuners etc.) constitute 18% and 29% share of the components respectively. While the industry composition is not predicted to change substantially, there is a rapid decline in products such as Cathode Ray Picture Tubes and CD/DVDs which had till recently constituted a signicant share of the manufacturing base and market. This is an outcome of advancing technology and consumer preferences.77 The chart estimates opportunities in electronics sector.78,79 While the consumer electronics segment holds the highest market share at 27% followed by electronic components and industrial electronics, the relative contribution of the segments are likely to change based on the growth of the sectors. The communication, broadcasting and mobile segment is poised for accelerated growth of over 20% per annum while segments of strategic, consumer and industrial electronics are likely to grow at more than 12% per year. By 2020, the communication, broadcasting and mobile segments - whose growth is driven primarily by the an expanding mobile phone market - and consumer eclectronics are likely to be the largest segments in the electronics sector, together accounting for nearly half of the total market.80 74 NSDC Report, Telecommunications 75 Telecom Regulatory Authority of India 76 Human Resource and Skill Requirements in the Electronics & IT Hardware Sector, National Skill Development Corporation - KPMG report 77 Annual Report 2015-16, Department of Electronics & IT, Government of India 78 Ibid. 79 Human Resource and Skill Requirements in the Electronics & IT Hardware Sector, National Skill Development Corporation - KPMG report 80 Ibid.

It has increased liberalisation and relaxed tariffs to promote growth in the sector, and given a green signal to the Modied Special Incentive Package Scheme, offering up to INR 11,300 crore in benets to the electronics sector in next ve years. The Government has identied electronic systems as one of 25 focus sectors in the 'Make in India' campaign, allowing 100% foreign direct investment under automatic route for the electronics systems design and manufacturing.82 Demand is rising due to government schemes such as the National Knowledge Network and National Optical Fibre Network, a need for tablets for the education sector, digitisation policy and various other broadband schemes. Highlights of the NPE 12 policy by Government of India include:83 A Modied Special Incentive Package Scheme subsidy of 25% of capital expenditures (20% in SEZs), and all excise/CVD paid on capital equipment is reimbursed An Electronic Manufacturing Cluster Scheme provides 50% of the cost for development of infrastructure and common facilities in greeneld clusters (undeveloped or underdeveloped areas from electronic manufacturing point of view) and 75% of the cost for browneld clusters (area where a signicant number of EMCs exist). Land can be made readily available in the 30 or so new Electronic Manufacturing Clusters with Government support. The Government aims to create about 200 by 2020 To promote research in electronics and IT, the Government will fund about three thousand PhD students in universities across the country. Providing opportunities for skill development for the private sector through two Sector Skills Councils\u2014Telecom and Electronics. Under the scheme for providing support for skill development, Government of India provides 75% to 100% of training cost for industry specic skills for skilled and semi-skilled workers Under the 'Make in India' scheme, 100% FDI is allowed under the automatic route in the ESDM sector. In case of electronics items for defence, FDI up to 49% is allowed under the government approval route; anything above 49% is allowed through the approval of the cabinet committee on security The objective of NPE-12 is to build an ecosystem for a globally competitive ESDM sector in the country by attracting investment of about INR 667,000 crore and generating 28 million jobs The ultimate aim of the policy is to develop core competencies in strategic and core infrastructure sectors including telecommunications, automobile, avionics, industrial, medical, solar, information and broadcasting, railways, and intelligent transport systems. 82 Annual Report 2015-16, Department of Electronics & IT, Government of India 83 National Policy on Electronics 2012, Department of Electronics and Information Technology Anchor sectors for Amaravati 55Several state governments, including Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, have announced complementary incentives. Electronic Manufacturing Clusters have been announced by Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, and Kerala. Other states are also taking similar initiatives, thereby offering a host of incentives and facilities for ESDM investors. 2. Financial incentives The Union Government has taken steps to provide additional nancial incentives to the electronics industry, including:84 Basic customs duty on digital still image video cameras with certain specications reduced to nil Excise duty on round copper wire and tin alloys used in PV solar cells manufacture changed to nil Basic customs duty on black light module for use in manufacture of LCD/LED TV panels changed from 10% to nil Organic LED TV panels custom duty from 10% to nil Customs duty on wafers for use in manufacture of IC modules for smart cards reduced from 12% to 6% Preference to domestically manufactured electronics goods in government procurement. Extent of government procurement from domestic manufacturers will not be less than 30% of the total procurement Subsidy of 50-75%\u2014up to INR 66 crore per 100 acres; applicable to both greeneld and browneld projects For exports, a 2% duty credit scrip; special focus product scheme up to 5% duty credit scrip. 3. Rise in consumer buying power Rising disposable incomes amongst Indian consumers are driving penetration of electronic goods, consumption of white goods, and replacement frequency, driving double-digit growth in the electronics industry.85 4. Offline and online organised retail E-commerce as a channel is growing by nearly 40% per year, with both online players and omni-initiatives. Companies like Croma, Reliance Digital and eZone have changed the way consumers shop for electronics, raising visibility and access to all types of electronics goods.86 84 Union Budget, 2015-16 85 Trading economics, based on statistics reported by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, Government of India 86 ASSOCHAM - Deloitte Report, 'Future of e-Commerce: Uncovering Innovation' Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 565. Increasing affordability Innovation has improved the affordability of mobile handsets, computers, laptops and the entire gamut of electronics goods, enabling the industry to capture a larger 'share of wallet' even among the lower and middle classes. 6. Growing rural demand The electrication of rural areas, government schemes for infrastructure and social development have improved accessibility and incomes in rural India. As a result, many industries now view rural populations as a signicant market, which has rapidly increased the use of mobile handsets, electronic inverters, and TV in rural areas. 7. Public spending Government spending in aerospace and defence as well as initiatives such as the Smart Cities project, UIDAI, and Digital India have boosted the consumption of industrial electronics and electronic components at all levels of the value chain. The government spent more than INR 260 billion on IT in 2013, nearly half of it in the hardware segment, and its spending is growing at about 11% per year.87 Consequently, this has been a key growth driver for the industry in India. 8. Technology and Product innovation The emergence of new product categories such as LED lighting, automotive electronics, energy meters, solar energy and IT products have raised consumers' interest and has helped the market flourish. Proposed investments and market developments in this sector India has witnessed a six-fold jump in proposed investments in local electronic manufacturing to INR 1.14 lakh crore, as global rms such as Samsung, LG and Foxconn set up factories in the country, among the world's largest markets for smartphones and set-top boxes.88 The government has received 156 proposals with investment commitments of INR 1.13 lakh crore modied special incentive package scheme (M-SIPS), according to a report by Economic Times.89 India is also pushing for more local buying of defence electronics and avionics as part of its overall indigenisation efforts in defence and aerospace. The IESA said the new investment proposals were received under the Modied Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS) that provides nancial incentives to private companies for setting up electronics manufacturing units, helping to grow India's ESDM sector. Global electronic contract manufacturers are also witnessing this shift. World's largest contract manufacturer Foxconn , for instance, has pledged to invest INR 33,000 crore in India over the next ve years, supporting not just smartphone makers but also other electronics vendors by 87 Electronita, 'Making India an Electronics Manufacturing hub' 88 Telecom Regulatory Authority of India 89 Economic Times, 'Government has received INR 1.13 lakh crore electronic sectors for Amaravati 57manufacturin g components. Foxconn's rival Flex, which has a si gnicant presence in India, produces LED li ghts, electronic ballasts and GPS trackin g devices for India's domestic market. Flex Chennai has for ged a new partnership with Lenovo (which also owns Motorola Mobility) to manufacture their smartphones in India.

More than 70% o f India's electronics market is expected to be dependent on imports o f nished goods and components93. This su ggests a hu ge potential in movin g up the value chain. Policies and incentives in place now, cou pled with promised investments in this sector, are likely to lead India to areas of equipment desi gn, wafer and chip manufacturin g, and R&D. Top industry needs in electronics and how Amaravati could address them Given the importance o f the electronics sector in India, a planned and coordinated strategy could help a state gain competitive advantages to create jo bs, spur local development and generate economic activity. The potential o f the electronics sector as a driver o f economic growth and employment globally has been proven by the fast development of Schenzen in China, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. The number of jobs that could be created varies widely by sector. For example, jobs created in assembly outnumber those in fabrication and semicon ductor segments. India has remained at the lower end o f the electronics value chain even though domestic manufacturing has picked up. The geographical spread has been limited to SKD/CKD assembly units in select states, as shown in the gure . 93 NSDC Re port, Electronics and IT hardwar eFigure 19:Domestic manu facturing in this sector so far has been limited to SKD/CKD assem bly in se lect states... dqindia.com/g402West Bengal pioneered electronics manu facturin g in the country as Philips and Videocon set u p their manufacturin g facilitie s/g402India focuses on the low value- added part of electr onics manufacturing (assembly operations ) and does not have significant footprint in upstream activities (fabs) /g402India could tar get \"dicing an d packa ging operations \" in the medium term.

In this respect, the Andhra Pradesh Electronic Policy of 2014 aims to develo p the electronics industry as a growth throu gh its talent pool, skill enhancement, promotion of innovation and future technolo gies and the creation of excellent infrastructure. The policy aims to attract investments to the tune of INR 33,000 crore in ESDM sector and create 400,000 jobs by 202094. The scal incentives offered by the State government include : a.Registration and stamp duty :The electronics industry will be eligible for 100% reimbursement of the Stamp Duty, Transfer Duty and Registration Fees paid on sale or lease deeds on the rst transaction and 50% o f the second transaction . b.Power subs idy:50% to micro, 40 % to small and 25 % to medium-size and 10 % to large-scale industry limited INR 50 lakh on power bills for 5 years from the date o f commencement o f commercial operations. c.Exemption o f electricity duty: New electronic hardware units, a fter coming into commercial operation, will be entitled for 100% exemption on electricity duty for 5 years . d.Patent ling cost: The cost o f ling patents will be reimbursed to companies with headquarters in Andhra Pradesh, subject to a limit o f INR 5 lakh per domestic patent awarded and INR 10 la kh per international patent awarded. e.Quality certication: 50% subsidy on the expenses incurred for quality certi cation up to INR 4 lakh CMM Certication, SA, RU, etc. ) f.Cleaner and greener production measures :25% subsidy on cleaner and green production measures limited to INR 10 la kh. g.VAT/C ST reimbursement: 100% tax reimbursement of VAT and C ST for the new units started a fter the date o f issue o f this policy, for 5 years from the date o f commencement of production for products manu factured and sold in sectors for Amaravati 61 \"In the global rank for electronics, India has the potential to outperform many of its peers in the long-term.\"h. Skill upgrades and training: 50% reimbursement or grant of costs of improving skills and training local manpower up to INR 2,000 per person. i. Investment Subsidy: 20% up to INR 20 lakh for MSME and an additional 5% investment subsidy for women/SC/ST entrepreneurs. j. Interest rebate of 3% up to INR 5 lakh per year for 5 years k. Capital subsidy of 10% on new equipment for technology upgrades up to INR 25 lakh as one time availment by the eligible company. l. Rebate on land cost of 25% up to INR 10 lakh per acre in industrial estates, industrial parks, SEZ's, EMCs. 2. Favourable sourcing of raw materials and labour: Raw materials and labour resources are keys to the development of an electronics cluster in Amaravati. The city must therefore make a special effort to secure a skilled and literate manpower base, which includes training and upgrading skills to meet the demands of the upstream electronics industry. 3. Operational costs: The two most signicant costs for manufacture and design of equipment are skilled professionals (on average 60-70% of total costs) and utilities (on average 10-15% of total costs)95 that vary based on factors such as the local cost of living and access to grid power, which is cost-competitive and reliable in Amaravati. 4. Logistics and connectivity: Well-developed infrastructure in the form of reliable utilities, well-connected hubs and shared services may reduce overall operational costs by minimising disruptions, ensuring access to markets and achieving economies of scale. Uninterrupted water and power supplies are critical, for example, as water-tanker and generator costs are typically double those of grid supply. Reliable roads, rails, airports and seaport capacity ensure that goods may reach downstream processors and markets. Amaravati has an advantage here due to its commitment to 24x7 power and water, year- round water availability from the Krishna River, power surplus with supply from the Vijayawada power station, access to good roads, the airport and second-largest rail junction in Vijayawada, and the seaport in Kakinada, about 300 km away. It is important to remember that as India moves up the value chain in the manufacture of chips and wafers, logistics needs move from seaports to airports. Amaravati seems well-prepared on both grounds. It is important to remember that as India moves from lower down the value chain to higher up in manufacture of chips and wafer, the logistics need goes from seaports to airports and Amaravati seems well covered on both grounds. 5. Land cost: To compete globally, electronics manufacturers must be able to obtain land at costs that are competitive with adjoining areas with similar productivity. As a matter of policy, Amaravati could lease land parcels to interested parties rather than selling the land outright, which might also include a 'development clause' as in most land development 95 Industry expert Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 62across India. Sri City, for example, offers land for about INR 14 lakh per acre, with additional INR 50-80 lakh per acre for infrastructure development.96 How Amaravati can avoid pitfalls The Electronics Park and electronics cluster in Amaravati is envisioned to be a well-planned industrial estate with world-class infrastructural. Requisite support is planned to be provided in all aspects to facilitate production and marketing including roads, power, water supply, drainage, sewerage, an internal road network and linkages with external road, rail and air networks. The park will have an environment friendly water management system, avenue plantations, sewage and effluent carrying pipelines and a common effluent treatment plant. The maintenance of the park will be undertaken by the industry, eliminating the risk of poor maintenance. The park is aimed be a one-stop-shop for domestic and international buyers, offering modern recreational facilities of international standards. To ensure that Amaravati achieves its aspiration for an industrial park, it must avoid pitfalls, including: 1. Challenges in land acquisition and delays in statutory approvals from the state government: Many projects have been delayed due to landholding issues and lack of government support. State-specic strict land ceiling and sub-leasing laws can limit how much can be acquired, for example, preventing sub-leasing in certain states. Amaravati should therefore sort out all legal and political issues relating to land acquisition before approaching investors and businesses for the electronics park. 2. Creation of the supply chain: To graduate to the higher end of the electronics value chain, Amaravati will need to build a fully integrated supply chain to ensure proper linkages with container port terminals and airport to minimise inventory and lead times, and make skilled manpower and raw materials available, and support shared logistical solutions. Thus, it is of paramount importance that only genuine bidders are invited and 'special clauses' are introduced to prevent speculation in real estate. 3. Risks of speculators: Many real estate development projects attract speculators who have no intention of building or operating a business. They merely bet on the appreciation of land prices and liquidate their holdings at a margin, defeating the purpose of these parks. 4. Access to nancial credit: Whilst large players can afford the rental and development costs of an integrated park, smaller and medium-sized players might nd it difcult due to opportunity costs outside the park, especially OEMs and ODMs. The city should therefore set up credit mechanisms in consultation with banks and other nancial institutions who can offer easy credit at attractive rates especially for the designated parks. 96 Industry experts Anchor sectors for Amaravati 635. Operationalising the policy aspects: While a good policy for a sector is important, putting the policy into action is even more important. To avoid pitfalls, the city should help build an ecosystem with the right features, including: Attractive nancial incentives to mega projects as mentioned in APEP Ease of doing business through single-window clearances, time-bound approvals and exemptions from approvals listed in APEP Land at discounted prices, considering high employment and economic linkages Subsidies and incentives for setting up manufacturing facilities to capture the higher end of the electronics value chain Systems to ensure high-quality, uninterrupted power Institutes for training and skill-building to provide a mass base of skilled. While Amaravati has the advantage of proximity to raw materials, it should also provide developers with encumbrance-free land as part of the master plan, establish strict evaluation criteria for selecting park developers, develop excellent connectivity infrastructure to source raw materials as link to export markets, and offer a compelling economic proposition in terms of capex and opex savings. The vision for electronics at Amaravati Even though India lags the global electronics industry, it has the potential to outperform many of its peers in the long term. It has vast opportunities in areas such as access (wireless), digitisation (electronic society), security and surveillance, education (digital classrooms), energy (smart meters), healthcare (affordable medicine and telemedicine) and automotive (low-cost emissions). Of the four stakeholders - industry organisations, the private sector, educational and research centres and government - the latter is taking measures to build an ecosystem to support the industry's long-term growth and sustainability. These measures include developing tech parks and high-tech clusters, encouraging partnerships and foreign technology-based venture capital investments, increasing core spending on R&D, sharing risks in launching and running industry initiatives, strict implementation of IP rights to promote innovation, and providing nancial backing for initiatives and human resource development. The long-term aspiration for Amaravati is to emerge as the preferred destination as an electronics manufacturing hub focussing on design and fabrication. To achieve that vision and create a vibrant ecosystem of companies, the city will need to evolve over the next 10-15 years and build its capabilities in a range of segments of the sector. Beginning with assembly, the objective is to expand to manufacturing of components over 6-10 years. This could lead to a signicant increase in local value addition in the sector - and could create a localised supply chain for components and parts which could be used in an established assembly ecosystem. Over the longer term, the industry sector could be prepared and nurtured to attract design and fabrication companies which could bring in signicant investment in high-tech plants and expand the need for highly skilled talent.

Fashion and apparel Overview India's centuries-old textile industry has traditionally employed the vast ma jority of workers, and it played an important role durin g the nation's stru ggle for freedom. The industry got a much-needed push after liberalisation in 1991, and today it is the world's second-lar gest producer of cotton and silk raw materials as well as textile and clothin g. It ranks sixth for only clothin g exports .97 The Indian textiles and apparel industry is projected to grow by 10-11 % annually to 2021, from INR 4.5 to 9.5 lakh crore for domestic production, and from INR 2.7 to 5.5 lakh crore for exports.98India accounts for almost 24% o f the world's spindle capacity and 8% o f rotor capac ity.99Abundant raw materials such as cotton, wool, silk and jute and skilled work force have made the country a sourcing hu b and have given it an advantage over competitive apparel exporters. The Government has identi ed textiles and garments as one o f 25 focus sectors in the 'Make in India' campaign, allowing 100% foreign direct investment under the automat ic route.100 The textile industry is the one o f the largest employers in the country, providing more than 15 million jobs, more than hal f of them in garmenting .101 The sector generates 50-250 jobs per acre, with capital-intensive textile se gments such as weavin g creatin g fewer garmentin g creatin g more per acre.102Textiles and garmenting contribute about 4% o f GDP, 14% to the overall Index o f Industrial Production and 13% to India's foreign exchange in flows.103 The industry can be divided into six sectors on the basis of fabric ty pe: Cotton, Silk, Wool, Synthetic, Technical textile and Others (Jute, Coir, etc.). It ma y also be divided into three categories of output: yarn and bre, fabric, and ready-made garments. Andhra Pradesh has a lon g-standin g legacy in the textile and apparel sector. It is the third-lar gest producer of cotton in India, producin g medium- grade and superior lon g- staple varieties.104 The capital re gion is especially endowed for this sector. Guntur is the second-lar gest cotton-producin g district in India and renowned for handloom industry. Viziana garam, East Godavari, Prakasam and Kurnool are the other major cotton producers in the re gion. Brandix India Apparel City (BIAC), a 1,000 acre park in Visakhapatnam, is one of the most ambitious inte grated textile parks in India. Given Amaravati's natural endowment of cotton and le gacy of textile manufacturin g and garmentin g, it may be developed as a stron g hub for the sector. The city could focus on the 97 IBEF Report, Textile and Apparel, 201 5 98 Ibid. 99 Ibid. 100Make in India, Government of Indi a 101'Annual Survey of Industries 2010-11', Ministry of Statistics and Planning, Government of India, as accessed on 6 February 2014 102Press search, industry interviews 103IBEF Report, Textile and Apparel, 201 5 104Directorate of Economics and Statistics, 2014-15, IBEF 201 5 Anchor sectors for Amaravati 67non-polluting downstream segment of garmenting, with textile mills and dyeing plants outside city limits. Amaravati is aimed to develop a hub with high environmental and social standards to produce organic cotton, for example, and fair-trade products. In the long run, the city could emerge as a global brand known for its earth- and people-friendly practices in addition to its competitive costs and high productivity. Key trends driving growth in this sector The Indian textile and garment industry is poised for strong growth buoyed by domestic consumption and export demand. 1. Policy support The Government is providing nancial incentives, encouraging foreign direct investment and promoting infrastructure developments with a range of initiatives105: 100% FDI is allowed under the automatic route in the textile sector A scheme for integrated textile parks provides world-class infrastructure to new units. So far, 57 have been sanctioned with an investment of INR 60 billion. By 2017, 25 more textile parks are to be sanctioned. An Integrated Skill Development Scheme has provided training to 1.5 million people in all sub-sectors such as textile and apparel, handicrafts, handlooms, jute and sericulture. A Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme has invested more than INR 2,600 billion in the industry. Support has been provided for modernisation and upgrades in the form of reduces interest rates and capital subsidies. The government has proposed to extend 24x7 customs clearance at 13 airports and 14 seaports, speeding the clearance of import and export cargo. Under the Market Development Assistance Scheme, nancial assistance is provided for a range of export promotion activities implemented by Textiles Export Promotion Councils. The Ministry of Textiles launched Technology Mission on Technical Textiles with two mini-missions for ve years with outlays of INR 200 crore. The objective is to promote technical textiles by helping to develop world-class testing facilities at eight Centres of Excellence across India, promoting indigenous development of prototypes, providing support for domestic and export market development, and encouraging contract research. 2. Additional scal incentives The Government has taken steps to provide additional scal incentives to the textile industry: 106 Raising the duty-free entitlement from 3% to 5% for imported trimmings and embellishments used by the readymade garment sector in the manufacture of exports. 105 Make in India, Government of India 106 Ibid. Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 68 Allowing two deductions: (i) Investment allowance (additional depreciation) at 5% to manufacturing companies that invest more than INR 1 billion in plant and machinery acquired and installed between January 2013 and March 2015, provided the aggregate investment exceeds INR 1 billion; (ii) To support companies engaged in manufacturing, an additional deduction of 15% of the cost of new plant and machinery, exceeding INR 250 million, acquired and installed during any previous year until March 31, 2017. Providing tax incentives for industry and private-sponsored R&D programmes: (i) a weighted tax deduction under Section 35 (2AA) of the Income Tax Act; (ii) a weighted deduction of 200% for any sums paid to a national laboratory, university or institute of technology, or specied persons directed to use the funds for scientic research within a programme approved by the prescribed authority; (iii) a weighted tax deduction of 200% under Section 35 (2AB) of the Income Tax Act for capital and revenue expenditures on scientic R&D. Expenditures on land and buildings are not eligible for deductions. The State offers incentives in areas such as subsidised land cost, relaxation in stamp duty exemptions on the sale or lease of land, power tariff incentives, concessional rates of interest, investment subsidies and incentives, 'backward area' subsidies and special incentive packages for mega projects. 3. Rise of the 'value consumer' The Value Apparel industry is growing at about 30% each year, thanks to the burgeoning middle class, increasing consumerism, higher disposable incomes and growing organised retail.107 4. Intensifying e-commerce E-commerce has emerged as an important new channel growing at about 40% per year, with both online players and omni-initiatives. Some leaders, such as Myntra and Flipkart, have doubled their apparel sales year-on-year. Kids' wear is especially online-driven - about 20% of total sales are made online, versus only about 7% of adult apparel, in part because parents nd shopping online more convenient than shopping in stores with children.108 5. Highly protable innerwear market Branded innerwear is a and fast-growing segment with top four players\u2014 Amul, Rupa, Lux, and Jockey \u2014 accounting for 45% of the market.109 Their success is driven by increasing brand consciousness, growing disposable incomes, higher media awareness and more discerning customers who prefer higher-quality products with innovative designs. As price sensitivity falls, Lux Onn and other players have moved up the price ladder, while Rupa and other leaders are increasing their Exclusive Business Outlet presence. 107 IBEF; NSDC; CMIE; Anchor sectors for Amaravati 696. Increasing role of technology With the influx of foreign investment, Indian manufacturers are investing in automation and other high-end technologies to increase productivity. Some are using automated machines for cutting, stitching, and quality checks, for example, while others are investing in digital printing and nishing technology that includes design and embroidery. Despite productivity improvements, India still lags other leading manufacturers due to disorganisation and antiquated technology. 7. Export focus Indian textiles and apparel exports are expected to increase by nearly 18% from 240,000 crore in 2013-14, primarily due to strong demand from the US and EU.110 India has emerged as an international sourcing hub due to its rich cotton production, low labour costs, falling energy costs and a weaker rupee. As garment manufacturers around the world continue to face cost pressures, growth in India is likely to continue, given the country's cost-competitiveness. China suffers from rising labour costs and higher lead times, while Bangladesh and Cambodia struggle with compliance and labour issues. 8. Urbanisation and changing lifestyles People's clothing needs are increasingly diverse with growing urbanisation and a rising proportion of youth, who tend to be more fashion-conscious. Functional clothing is giving way to home wear, ofce wear, and special occasion wear. More women are entering the workforce, raising demand for women's work wear. And with growing media awareness, global fashion trends are increasingly being adopted in India. Proposed investments and market developments in this sector Investments have risen sharply in the textiles sector in the last ve years, with 100% FDI. Major investments include: Welspun India Ltd. unveiled a new spinning facility at Anjar, Gujarat - the largest under one roof in India. The expansion reflects the ethos of the Government of Gujarat's recent 'Farm- Factory-Fabric-Fashion-Foreign' Textile Policy, aimed at strengthening the entire textile value chain.111 Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) plans to enter into a joint venture with China based Shandong Ruyi Science and Technology Group Co. to leverage RIL's textile business and distribution network in India and Ruyi's state-of-the-art technology and global reach.112 Giving Indian sarees a 'green' touch, DuPont has joined with RIL and Vipul Sarees to use Sorona, its renewable bre, to make an 'environment-friendly' version of this ethnic ladies' wear.113 110 IBEF, 2015 111 Business Standard, 'Welspun India unveils largest spinning facility under one roof at Anjar' 112 Reuters, 'India's Reliance to enter textile JV with China's Shandong Ruyi' 113 Business Line, 'DuPont joins hands with Reliance, Vipul for 'green' sarees' Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 70 Grasim Industries has invested 100 crore to develop its rst fabric brand, Liva, which it will distribute through 1,000 outlets as part of a plan to stay in sync with changing consumer behaviour.114 Snapdeal has partnered with India Post to bring thousands of weavers and artisans from Varanasi through its website. The endeavour is meant to 'empower local artisans, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs to sustain their livelihoods by providing a platform to popularise their indigenous products,' said Kunal Bahl, Snapdeal's co-founder and CEO.115 American casual fashion retailer A\u00e9ropostale has inked a licensing agreement with Arvind Lifestyle Brands to open 30 standalone stores 25 shop-in-shop in the country over the next three years.116 Segments and focus for Amaravati Segmentation by value chain 1. Raw material processing (Ginning, sheep-rearing, raising cocoons) - Ginning is the process of separating cotton bres from seeds. Modern cotton gins complete this process with much higher productivity than manual separation with powered cleaning cylinders and saws. The ginned cotton bre, known as lint, is compressed for transport into bales about 1.5 metres tall that weigh almost 220 kg. Sheep-rearing and shearing and cocoon sericulture create wool and silk respectively. Given the high-cotton production in Guntur, ginning will likely be required in the Andhra Pradesh capital region co-located with raw material source. This segment is not attractive for Amaravati as a focus, however, as it is commoditised and capital-intensive. 2. Spinning - Spinning converts raw material to yarn. Most spinning today is break or open- end, a technique where the staples are blown by air into a rotating drum, where they attach to the tail of formed yarn that is continually being drawn out of the chamber. The yarn is either dyed and sold as an end-product or converted to fabric. Dyeing is an effluent-generating process, classied as 'red' as per Ministry of Environment and Forests and therefore cannot be set up in Amaravati. Spinning is therefore not a focus segment for the city, although it may be set up in the capital region. 3. Weaving, knitting and nishing - Weaving and knitting are two processes to convert bre to cloth with varying elasticity and dimension stability. For example, knitted fabric is more elastic but has less dimensional stability than woven fabric. Fabric is then treated through nishing processes such as de-sizing, scouring, bleaching, mercerising, singeing, raising, calendaring, shrinking, dyeing and printing. 114 Economic Times, 'Grasim draws up INR 150 crore capex plan for brand Liva' 115 The Times of India, 'E-tailers prefer Speed Post to deliver to remote areas' 116 ET Retail, 'US-based A\u00e9ropostale forays into Indian market with Arvind' Anchor sectors for Amaravati 71Since dyeing is an integral part of fabric nishing and typically co-located with weaving and knitting, this sub-segment may not be set up in Amaravati but only in the capital region. 4.Garmenting and value-added services - Garmenting is the practice o f creating nished products from fabric and ancillaries, such as buttons. This includes cutting, making (sewing ), trimming and embroidery. End products include ready garments, home textiles such as towels, and technical textiles such as re-retardant material. Additional services such as product development and design, packaging, logistics and corporate functions are require d to support garmenting. Amaravati could focus on garmenting, as the sector is attractive and well- tting with the city's legacy o f textile and apparel and proximity to downstream sources. Garmenting generates no e ffluents and creates over 150 jobs per acre .117 In summary, garment manu facturing and value-added services could grow within the city limits in one or more industrial par k clusters, while other value-chain elements may be locate d in the capita l region outsi de the city. 117 Industry ex pertFigure 22:Value-chain steps result in intermediate products as well as finished goods Amaravat ifocus SOURCE: NSDC;industry expert sProces (not chemic dyeing, direct/block / steam perforatin g/g402Ginning, t, loading, truckin g Yarn /g402Ring spun yarn, Motor spun yarn/g402Shedding (forming warps), picking (insertin g wefts), compact ing and packing cloth Simple woven cloth /g402Twill (e.g., denim), Satin Complex/ decorative woven c loth /g402Dobby, Jacquar d, extra warps and wefts (double cloth) Knitted cloth /g402Jersey, woolensMade-ups /g402Garments , Coir (coconut ), Hemp Natura l (Animal) /g402Sheep wool, Silk, Cashmere wool Manmade Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 72Top needs in garment manufacturing and how Amaravati can meet them Garment manufacturers in Faridabad, Tirupur and other Indian locations have mar gins of 10-35% dependin g on type of fabric and order .118Amaravati will address the top four needs o f investors in t he sector: 1.Fiscal incentives: Fiscal sops o ffered by the state coupled with ease o f business in the state are deciding factors for investors. The Andhra Pradesh government offers 100% VAT, C ST and Entry Tax reimbursements, including zero-rated exports, capital subsidies o f 50% and flexible labour laws including three shi fts.119 In addition to a competitive packa ge compared to other leadin g states such as Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh offers hi gh ease of business - the state was ranked second for ease of doin g business by the World Bank. Sin gle-window approvals alon g with pre-approved plots with environmental clearance allow com panies to o perationalise within 9-12 months and recover ca pex faster. Fiscal incentives will need to be comparable to those of re gional competitors to establish food processin g at Amaravati . 2.Proximity to downstream su ppliers: The proximity of downstream su ppliers reduces overall product cycle time and im proves reliability. While downstream su ppliers will not be co-located in Amaravati, they may be setup in a sister park within 30-40 km in the re gion. 118Industry expert 119AP Textile Policy 2015-2 0Figure 23: Amaravati nee ds to be well -connected b y road or rail with major sources of fabric for apparel manufacturer s km Anchor sectors for Amaravati 733.Availability o f semi-skilled talent : Labour is a deciding factor in terms o f productivity and accounts for 30-50% o f total costs. Andhra Pradesh has a competitive minimum wage for this sector o f about INR 68,000 per annum, versus nearly 78,000 in Gujarat and 87,000 in Tamil Nadu. Amaravati also has a talent pool o f about 40,000 people: the land-pooling scheme volunteers, who, may be approached for training and recruitment.120 4.Utiliti es cost: Utilities accounts for 15-20% of costs, and reliable grid power is a key advanta ge as it costs less than half as much as diesel-fuelled generators . The capital city is committed to supplyin g 24x7 hi gh-quality quality power with an assured allocation of 1,000 me gawatts from the Vijayawada Thermal Power Plant, and 1,800 megawatts in the medium term after a capacity up grade . 5.Logistics and connectivity : Well-develo ped infrastructure in the form of reliable utilities, well-connected hubs and shared services may reduce overall o perational costs by minimisin g disruptions, ensurin g access to markets and achievin g economies of scale. Reliable roads, rails, airports and seaport capacity ensure that goods may reach markets domesticall y and internationall y. Amaravati will have an advanta ge here with its world-class infrastructure. It will offer access to two hi ghways, NH5 and NH9, for connectivity to Hyderabad, Chennai and Ban galore, 300-600 km away. The city will be about 250 km from Kakinada port and will develo p a new port within a 100 km radius in the lon g run (Machilipatnam or Vadarevu proposed).

Amaravati could o ffer a park with co-located ancillaries, such as trims and cardboard manu facturing, power with central backup, roads for container trafc, and common facilities (security, restaurants, meeting and video-conference rooms ). A sister park for upstream suppliers could be explored for the region.

Key elements which are planned to be developed in the short to medium term in Amaravati include: 1.An industrial park for apparel manufacturers in the city: Amaravati is envisioned to offer a world-class industrial park in the city for apparel manufacturers with fenced plots or ready- to-occupy built-up based on investors' preference. The park will provide all key amenities including 24x7 power, water and security, wide roads for container trafc and quick single- window clearances for all approvals. The park will also feature restaurants, meeting rooms, VCs, high-speed internet and working spaces for ofces. The park will promote co-location of ancillaries and other fringe suppliers in and around the park to save critical time during garment manufacture. While fabric is the major raw material, accessories and trims such as buttons, threads, cardboard packaging, embroidery, and labels are critical for the nal production, and shortages or supply disruptions lead to costly delays. Co-location will help reduce these disruptions, saving cost and improving cycle-time reliability.

The facilities will mirror most of those at the apparel park, with additional advanced effluent treatment and Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 76differing plot sizes, since upstream manu facturing is more capital-intensive and requires plots from 4 acres to 30 acres. The Ministry o f Environment and Forests mandates zero-discharge for industries. In line with Amaravati's vision o f sustainable development, the upstream park is being planned to offer advanced e ffluent treatment and green-belt techniques for sustainable manu facture . Although employment in this park will be less than 100 jobs per acre (compared with over 200 jobs per acre in garmenting ), the sister park is key to success of the overall sector given the economies o f logistics and upstream integration.121 121Industry ex pertsSOURCE: 2 86,513 Grasim Industries Ltd. 3 B F In dustries Ltd. 4 53,298 Vardhman Textiles Lt d. 5 52,603 ArvindLtd. 6 49,493 Trident Lt d. 7 39,258 (Home garments ) S R F Ltd. 8 37,500 Welspun India Ltd. 9 36,861 (Home garments ) WellknownPolyesters Lt d. 10 35,148Figure 26:Majority o f Indian textile majors are vertically integrated Finishe d goods o ffered Anchor sectors for Amaravati 77 3.'Made in Amaravati' brand synonymous with people and environmentally friendly products: The garment industry has long grappled with issues pertaining to environmental and labour practices. Brands which have ignored these developments have faced damaging backlash from increasingly discerning customers who have boycotted 'tainted' garments and will pay more for brands they believe are ethical . Amaravati, founded on the fundamentals o f human wellness and environmental sustainability, will aspire to o ffer India's best-managed city for ethical apparel production. Through strict regulation and monitoring, it will ensure that all produce from the region is free from illegal practices o f child labour, forced labour, unsa fe working environments and environmentally harm ful practices. It will promote practices to improve workers' lives, such as job training, and to protect the environment, such as organic cotton farming . 4.Training schoo ls and industria l training institutes: Amaravati will promote the creation o f ITIs in the city to develop the local talent pool. These will o ffer three- to six-month courses in garmenting in all forms o f stitching, cutting, fabric-making, etc. This support can empower local unskilled labour, readying them for employment in the apparel sector. 5.Design incubation hubs and training facilities: Amaravati will promote the top national and international design schools to set up incubation, R &D or training hubs in the city. It will explore collaborations with universities such as the National Institute o f Design amongst domestic design-leaders and Central Saint Martins amongst international fashion schools . Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 78 \"Amaravati will aspire to be India's best-managed city for ethical apparel production\"CASE STUDY: THE 'GARMENTS WITHOUT GUILT' MOVEMENT IN SRI LANKA1, 2, 3 As the 21st century unfolded, the world's biggest garment-producing countries competed mainly on price, and in 2005, export limits were lifted on China and other big players. Sri Lanka, which relied on garment manufacturing and related services for about 75% of its manufacturing jobs and almost 40% of industrial output, quickly lost share to lower-cost producers, many of whom enjoyed lower energy prices, more locally produced textiles, and more attention from the largest buyers. The business in Sri Lanka was shrinking fast - more than half of its garment factories had closed by 2008. Rather than trying to lower wages, the island nation considered its strengths and looked beyond price to consider the other needs of its biggest customers. Its strengths include design skills, flexibility, reliability and quality, but its most distinctive advantage is its responsible business practices, including strong environmental standards, good working conditions and fair wages. The industry rst targeted Italy, since clothing companies there place such a high premium on quality. Marketing and public relations campaigns raised Sri Lanka's prole as an ethical and high-end garment sourcing destination. Initiatives included a video, a two-day event for buyers in Milan, and one-on-one follow-up meetings at retailers' headquarters. Gaining important new buyers in Italy and branding itself as 'the world's #1 ethical apparel sourcing destination', Sri Lanka appealed to other buyers around the world. These efforts helped the country increase exports by about USD 7 million to France, Germany and Italy between 2005 and 2007. Exports to the U.S. rose from USD 2.9 billion in 2006 to USD 4 billion in 2011. The industry's sophisticated website offers buyers a range of information, insights and contact information. 1 Texsture, 'Garments without Guilt (Sri Lanka)' 2 Journal of Economic Geography, Oxford Journals, 'Garments without guilt? Uneven labour geographies and guilt' Anchor sectors for Amaravati 79Amaravati's long-term vision is to become a design hub with the highest productivity in India, and a preferred global sourcing destination for high-quality 'ethical' garments The apparel and fashion sector at Amaravati is envisioned to evolve in the long run from a contract manu facturing destination to an original design and brand development hub. The sector can be developed along four key areas: 1.Design an d innovat ion: Amaravati aims to build a strong design district which will be home to leading Indian and international design schools and fashion houses. With iconic landscaping and architecture, this district will create an environment o f creativity and innovation and will promote the emergence o f original brands and designs . 2.Environmenta l and socia l sustainabi lity: Through dedicated promotion and implementation o f environmentally and socially friendly practices, the city will have the potential to emerge as a global brand which is synonymous with guilt- free garments. From organic cotton and pollution- free production to fair-trade and people empowerment, the city could o ffer garment manu facturers an ethical sourcing destination while maintaining a cost-e ffective value proposition.

Amaravati aims to o ffer the most productive Indian hub for apparel by supporting and disseminating practices such as lean manu facturing, technology upgrades, reliable in frastructure and worker training . 4.Global sourcing destination: Despite the high cost o f operations, India is emerging as an attractive sourcing destination given increasing challenges faced by competing nations. For example, China is struggling with rising labour costs, and Bangladesh is facing compliance and labour-management problems. Given macro trends and India's increasing attractiveness, Amaravati aims to develop as a pre ferred sourcing destination for apparel globally and support improving access for local manu facturers to global markets through measures such as trade and fashion shows, tours in partner cities, quality-control certi cations and an international trade help desk . 122 UNIDO+30% +11%+14%+39%Figure 28: We benchmarked top garment exporters wit h d growth SOURCE: Intern ational Trade StatisticsTop clothin g/garment export countries value 2011 2013 +13% +39% +9%China (143 ) 1 China (165 ) 1 China (162 ) 1 Bangladesh (27) Bang ladesh (30) Hong Kong, China (23) 2 2 2 Italy (21) Italy (22) Vietnam (23) 3 3 3 Germany (20) Hong Kong,China (21 ) Italy (19 ) 4 4 4 Bangladesh (19) German y (18) Hong Kong, China (17) 5 5 5 India (14) Vietnam (17) India (17) 6 6 6 Turkey (14 ) India (16 ) Germany (17) 7 7 7 Vietnam (13) Turke y (15) Turkey (15) 8 8 8 France (10) Spain (11) Spain (12) 9 9 9 Netherlands (9) France (10) France (10 ) 10 10 102015 Anchor sectors for Amaravati 81Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 82 2.2.4.

The US leads the industry with 38% of the market, followed by Western Europe (Germany, France, the UK, and Italy) at 25% and China at 21%. The industry is growing at about 4.4% annually and should generate revenues of INR 2.9 million crore by 2018.123The sector's ke y drivers are cost containment, pricing and reimbursement controls and regulatory issues. India is home to Asia's fourth-largest medical device industry, which was dominated by domestic players until 1991, when India opened its markets to other players .124The technological expertise o f global leaders helped them gain share quickly, though many domestic players were quic k to learn and managed to survive . Revenues in the Indian medical device sector topped INR 33,000 crore in 2014 and should continue to grow by about 13 % each year to reach 42,500 crore by 2018.125 Revenues fr om domestic device production grew from INR 7,300 to 15,000 crore from 2009 to 2014, an annual increase of 15%. About 55% of domestic production is ex ported to Thailand, Myanmar, Kenya and other markets. Medical equipment exports grew by about 17% annually from INR 4,000 to 8,800 crore from 2008 to 2014. Drivers of this phenomenal growth include risin g incomes, increased focus on personal health, the penetration of health insurance, medical tourism, a rise in the number of hospitals and clinics, and government support, includin g 100% FDI permission in this sect or.

Devices: This segment includes all diagnostic apparatus and accessories such as X-ray lms and contrast media. This sector has been volatile in the past 5 years, but now it represents 55% of the domestic market.130 Major growth drivers include access, GDP growth, consumer buying power, population growth, healthcare expenditures, technological improvement, and increases in the number of healthcare institutions. It can be further classied into small and medium-sized devices and large devices. The small and medium-sized segment is the largest and represents approximately 45% of the domestic consumption of the industry. This segment comprises of diagnostic apparatus such as electrocardiographs, ultrasound scanners, and X-ray machines. It grew from 7,300 to 11,300 crore from 2008 to 2014 and should grow at about 13% annually to INR 18,600 crore in 2018.131 Developing these devices requires skilled labour which is available in South India. The large device segment was the smallest in 2014, representing 6-7% of the industry. It should grow at 12% per year from INR 1,160 to 2,100 crore from 2014 to 2018132. It includes three major types of equipment used in hospitals: scintigraphic apparatus, MRI and CT scanners. Since importing these devices is cheaper than manufacturing them, over 90% are imported, most from South Korea, China and the US. 2. Supplies include consumables such as syringes, bandages, needles, rst aid boxes, and gloves, along with patient aids such as dental xtures, hearing aids, and pacemakers. This segment represents close to 45% of the overall consumption in India.133 Overall, it has seen steady growth in the past 5 years and should continue to grow at the same pace in coming years. It can further classied as consumable and implants. Consumables are the most fragmented segment in India, with 50% of them developed in India. This segment should grow at about 16% annually to more than INR 17,000 crore by 2018.134 Major imports in this segment are syringes, needles, and catheters from the US, Singapore and Ireland. Major players include Hindustan Syringes and Medical Devices, Becton Dickinson, Sutures India Pvt. Ltd. Implants, the fastest-growing segment at 19% per year, should reach sales of INR 3,800 crore in 2018. It represents 5% of the industry and includes xation devices, articial joints, etc. Imports account for 90% of this segment, with the US alone accounting for over 50% of the imports.135 130 India Medical Devices Report, BMI Research, 2015 131 Ibid. 132 Ibid. 133 Ibid. 134 Ibid. 135 Ibid. Anchor sectors for Amaravati 85 Key trends driving growth in this sector India's medical device industry is in fluenced by the country's GDP, policies, healthcare expenditures, ageing population, insurance penetration, rising awareness o f healthcare needs, and disposable incomes. The industry in India represents just 1.3% o f the global medical device market,136 which is led by the U S, followed by Western Europe and China. As the Government takes steps to promote indigenous manu facturing, the consumer landscape changes, exports rise, and Indian manu facturers use more innovative sales methods, the national industry should gain momentum. 1.Policy support Duty structure changes: The Government has increased import duties on medical devices for surgical, dental and veterinary use from 5% to 7.5% and withdrawn exemptions from the additional customs duty o f 4% to boost local manu facturing, reducing the customs duty by same amount, along with full exemption from additional customs duty on raw materials required to manu facture them indigenously .137 Under the Make in India scheme, 100% FDI is allowed throu gh automatic route. With the duty structure reversed, this move will likely hel p domestic production rather than serving as a trading hub for foreign companies who might set up subsidiaries here to take advantage of it . 136 BMI Espicom, India Medical Devices Report Q3, 201 4 137 Import duty on medical devices raised, Jan 20, 2016, Business StandardFigure 30:Growth in m arket size 16% 19%13%12%INR crore researc hKey characteristic s /g402Medical devices c onsists of two broad segments w hich are further su b-divided -Devices: Lar ge and Small and medium -Supplies: Consuma bles and im plants /g402High degree of fragmentation in the market for consumables /g402Consumables is a distribution dependent segment /g402Small & medium device industr y provide o pportunit y Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 86The Indian Council o f Medical Research has multiple institutes under its purview, which engage in R &D in various medical specialties and technolo gies.138 The Stanford India Biodesign Programme is an ambitious public-private partnership programme between Stanford University, Government of India, IIT Delhi, AIIM S and other supporters to produce the next generation o f innovators in this industry.

More people are falling ill due to fluctuating temperatures ,141 water contamination ,142lack o f proper sanitation in rural areas, and rising pollution in cities,143amongst other reasons. All these trends will increase the demand for medical devices in India to diagnose patients quic kly and accurately and to treat them sooner . The use o f social media has grown exponentially over the past several years, and not just amongst teenagers. Doctors use social media to make people aware o f hygiene practices and emergency rst aid, for example .144 Seminars and workshops or ganised by industry members, screenin g tests or ganised by community members, and so on can make people more aware of medical advances and raise demand for new medical technolo gies. 3.Signicant percenta ge of a geing population More than 11 million Indians we over the a ge of 60 of a ge in 2011; their numbers should reach 200 million b y 2025145 and 300 million b y 2050 .146An a geing population will need more medical device su pport, es pecially in ortho paedic and prosthetic devices. 138ICMR website accessed Dec 6 , 2012 139Taking advanta ge of the Medtech market potential in India: Success will hin ge on operatin g model innovation, PWC 140World Bank report, 201 4 141NSSO survey, 201 4 142Reuters report, 2016 143Real-Time Air Qualit y Index, 201 6 144Using Social Media to Increase Awareness of Medical Specialties amon g Physicians, 2013, Forbe s 145Torsekar, 'India's medical device sector: Increasing U S export opportunities', U SITC Executive meetin g in brief 146Changing Contours o f India, CARE Ratings, 201 5 Anchor sectors for Amaravati 87 \"Driven by their cl ient needs, the industry is moving more towards sophisticated CNC machinery.\"4. Largely uninsured population According to IRDA, only 18% of Indians had health insurance in March 2014, and WHO reports that 86% of expenses incurred by individuals are out-of-pocket expenses. Private insurance players aim to increase their penetration in India. Companies such as Star Health insurance are looking to raise money, Cigna and Anthem are considering a merger, while other carriers are creating innovative products such as indemnity plans where a buyer chooses a doctor and hospital. The Government also has its own Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana to give BPL families access to high-quality medical treatment by cashless insurance for a minimal fee of up to INR 30. With annual growth of 14% in the health insurance market, it will soon be a INR 33,000 crore industry.147 All these factors indicate that as more people get insured, they will seek better healthcare facilities as their out-of-pocket expenses decline. 5. Medical tourism A weaker rupees has lowered the cost of healthcare for medical tourists. Roughly 200,000 foreign patients travel to India each year to seek medical treatment.148 Many are from the US and UK, but more than a third come from Bangladesh, Afghanistan, the Persian Gulf and Africa, which are closer to India and lack proper healthcare facilities. 6. Increasing competition with advent of private players As per the Economic Survey 2014-15, the Government's spending on healthcare is only 1.2% of GDP, down from 1.4% in 2013-14, which is lower than the 3% China spends and 8.3% in the United States. To improve its ranking in the Human Development Index, India has to increase healthcare expenditures, most of which would need to come from public/private partnerships or private players to avoid deepening government decits. Many private players are already investing in India. The Medanta Group, for example, has established Medicity in Gurgaon, and the Sahara Group plans to set up a 1,500 bed multi-speciality tertiary care hospital at Aamby Valley City.149 7. Localised Innovation and consumerisation Companies such as Philips, Nitro Boosters, O2Matic, and Medtech Innovators Park in Delhi have invested in products to meet the needs of rural and semi-urban India where healthcare facilities lag. Philips developed an entry level catherisation lab for cheap cardiac care,150 Nitro Boosters developed anaesthesia using industrial by-products and fertilisers as raw material, the O2matic device produces oxygen without electricity.151 All these innovations foster a need to set up medical hubs that would allow MNCs and domestic producers to understand the needs of India and develop innovative solutions. 147 IRDA, 2014 report on health insurance - Business Standard 148 Press Information Bureau, GOI 149 Changing Contours of medical device industry in India, 2015, CARE ratings 150 Business Standard, 'Philips hic rolls out made in India cath lab for India and global markets' 151 Better India, 'Medical Innovations for rural India' Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 88The main drivers behind consumerisation is the emergence o f new technologies such as smartphones and social media, an increased focus on costs, and elevated customer expectat ions.152The Samsun g S6 Ed ge and other smartphones now come with sensors to measure heart rate and calories burnt.

Lupin has already set up a new manu facturing unit there, and it is a home to Ayurvedic companies Baidyanath and Vicco.156 This is possible because o f Nagpur's advantages such as its central location, good rail, road and air connectivity, a 500 hectare IT hub to cater to needs of incoming companies, and SEZ advantages of IT, sales tax and service tax exempt ions. With multiple medical hu bs in place and new ones coming online, Amaravati will need to develop a focused strategy be fore setting up its own new medical hub. Focus on Amravati and medical device industry Amongst medical device segments, small and medium-scale apparatus has a higher potential because the raw materials required can be sourced locally, and only 40% o f products are manu factured locally. The other segments are not as interesting; large-scale apparatus represent just 6% o f the industry, for example, and has the slowest growth at 11% .157Since 90% o f needs are met by imports, and the segment is very small, focusing on it would be o f no use. The consumable segment is a highly fragmented, with over 750 companies in the space and only a hand ful with revenues o f over INR 50 crore.158 Also, since consuma bles are required on regular basis by all customers, companies need strong distri bution channels and huge operational expenses, leaving small pro t margins.

Machine tools Industry landscape Machine tools hel p com panies produce critical com ponents to meet precise industry specications and are the bedrock of many new industries. Demand for machine tools in India was about INR 12,200 crore in 2015 and is likely to grow to 20,200 crore in 2018 at a CAGR of 18.3%.159 India today is a net importer o f machine tools . Total consumption has more than doubled since 2006, with 2012 being a pea k year, and the industry has moved toward local production with less re liance on imports. Machine tools can be categorised by their purpose and the technology used. They can be segmented into metal-cutting tools and metal forming, for example, and by conventional and computer numerical control (CNC ). Driven by client needs, the industry is moving more towards sophisticated CNC machinery; local players need to build capa bilities to meet this demand, but high investment costs create resistance to improving technology. However, the Ma ke in India programme, along with state - level exemptions, are geared to help bridge this supply gap locally. Machine tool exports are negligi ble, worth a bout INR 280 crore in 2015.160 The Indian Machine Tools Manu facturers Association's export promotion programme aims to boost this number through various bene t programmes and coaching to help Indian manu facturers compete on quality and price in the global mar ket. 159Source 160IBEF Report, 91,191 42,51763,863 2015 Report; BMI research Anchor sectors for Amaravati 93Type of machine Predominantly used machine Less or moderately used machine Metal cutting HMC and VMC Turning Gear cutting Boring Honing Metal forming Forging Press brake Shearing Presses CNC proling (laser, water jet) Bending, folding and straightening Forging Punching Uses of machine tools The machine tool sector in India primarily serves the automobile, auto components and die and mould industries, with other notable industries being mobile handsets, energy, aerospace and railways. the automotive industry, including parts, is the largest end-client and accounts for over 50% of the total usage. Dies and moulds are the third-largest industry for machine tools, with about 15% of the market. The industry uses both metal cutting and metal forming tools, with 44% of total investment being machine tool spend.161 Older industries like defence and aerospace and energy and power account for 6% of demand and are growing slowly, while newer industries like mobile headsets, though accounting for only 5%, is a high-growth industry.162 The 2018 estimates show the market structure with overall annual growth of 18.3%. Industries grow at different rates, with mobile handsets being the fastest-growing at 31% while railways should grow only at 5%. No major change is expected in the share of automobiles and auto components - that industry will continue to dominate machine tool demand. With innovation and safety as driving forces in the auto sector, machine tool manufacturers need to signicantly improve quality and customisation of products to compete with global rms. Market drivers The growth in demand for machine tools is linked closely to the growth in the automotive sector and investment in key industries as a whole. With many foreign car manufacturers setting up production in India in recent years, demand for sophisticated machine tools should continue growing. 161 IBEF Report, Engineering 162 Ibid. Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 94Government re gulations have reduced interest rates, fuel prices, and inflationary pressures. This has facilitated car nance penetration, es pecially in rural areas and smaller cities, while OEMs focus on untapped rural markets in pursuit of business growth . A study by ACMA, IMTMA and Roland Ber ger Strate gy Consultants shows that growth in the automotive sector will propel machine tool consumption in India to grow from INR 8,650 crore in 2014 to 20,000 crore b y 2020 at 14% CAGR . The growth of Indian machine tool manufacturers can be hi gher, as import substitution is hi gh on agenda of the automotive industry due to the adverse impact of exchan ge rates. Market trends and challenges The Indian machine tool market is fragmented with many small to medium-size players. But with strong and steady growth, consolidation has begun and is expected to continue into the near future. For example, BFW acquired Proteck Machinery in 2015 .163,164 Large vendors and international players are also facing competition from new foreign entrants due to favourable government support on trade incentives. New foreign trade agreements are being signed to move machine tool import duties gradually toward zero. License is not required to set up machine tool manu facturing in the country. Indeed, the Department o f Heavy Industry has launched a scheme to enhance the competitiveness i f the Indian capital goods industry. One component is setting up integrated industrial infrastructural facilities (IIFC) for the machine tool industry, which is expected to augment capacity. In addition to IIFC, government supports the creation o f a centre o f excellence for technology development, based on the understanding that developing advanced technology will li kely raise import substitution and boost the domestic mar ket.165 163International Journal of Enhanced Research in Science Technolo gy & En gineerin g 164Business Standard, 'BFW acquires turnin g business of Proteck Machinery ' 165Department o f Heavy Industry website at http://www.dhi.nic.i nFigure 33: Automobile investment vs. Machine tool demand 63,600 0 12,200 2015 2018Machine investment SOURCE: Study for Establishin g Investment Linka ges for Machine Tool industry -Feedback Consultin g, IMTMAINR crore CAGR11% CAGR18.3% Anchor sectors for Amaravati 95Given the competitive nature o f the industry and the threat o f new entrants, vendors are cautious a bout introducing new machine tools. They are instead developing part-wise advancements so that there is no drastic change in the cost o f the nal product and price offered to clients. Apart from the parts enhancement, they are developing custom so ftware applications for different end-user segments, staying competitive by meeting a wide range o f requirements and characteristics . The Make in India policy has highlighted machine tools as a focus sector; the Government will use policy and economic schemes to help improve the industry 's competitiveness: National investment and manu facturing zones where the government will bear the costs of master planning, and improving and providing external physical in frastructure linkages, including rail, road, ports, airports and telecom, institutional in frastructure for productivity, skill development and the promotion o f domestic and global investment . Central and State governments will provide exemptions from labour and environmental rules and regulations subject to the fullment o f certain conditions. A technology acquisition and development fund has been proposed for the acquisition o f appropriate technologies, the creation o f a patent pool and the development o f domestic manu facturing o f equipment to control pollution and reduce energy consumption .166 Industry requirements Given the specialised nature o f the industry, there are ve key components required to set up a machine tool manu facturing unit in India : 166 Make in India website (www.makeinindia.com ) Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 96 Requirements Details Large capital investmentConventional machine tools are expensive, and CNC machine tools can cost 5 to 10 times more Skilled labour Highly skilled technicians are required to operate the complex and sophisticated technology, which raises operational costs.

The proliferation of di gital and communication technolo gies, private participation and policy push are all conver ging to create a more res ponsive healthcare delivery system . Private participation is developin g a stron g healthcare ecosystem in the form of hospitals, medical devices, health insurance, medical equipment, etc. As the government takes on the challen ge to deliver healthcare to every citizen, the private sector will need to develop secondary and tertiary facilities that deliver these services. Of the 196,312 hos pitals in the country in 2015, 74% were private entities such as A pollo, Fortis, Max, Medanta, Mani pal, Narayana Health and other smaller players. Also, of the 404 medical colle ges offerin g MBBS programmes in the country in 2015, more than half are private .167 Adding to this trend is the rejuvenation o f traditional systems o f medicine, which play a large role in the country. AYU SH with its low-cost, non-invasive and natural treatment is a promising healthcare delivery route that leverages traditional knowledge o f herbal medicines. The market for AYU SH therapies and products generated revenues of about INR 11,580 crore in 2015, and is growing 10-15 % per annum, with the potential to reach 20,400 crore by 2020 .168,169 Remote healthcare services and telemedicine are also growth drivers for the industry. Some leading corporate chains, including Apollo Hospitals and Medanta, provide remote healthcare services. These services were valued at over INR 50 crore in 2012 and are expected to grow annually by nearly 20 % to about INR 130 crore by 2017.170 Andhra Pradesh has been a pioneer in telemedicine with initiatives, such as a rural telemedicine centre in Aragonda as early as 1991 by the Apollo Telemedicine Networking Foundation, a non-pro t organisation within the Apollo Hospitals Group . Growing medical tourism also presents signi cant opportunities. In 2011, India received over 8.5 lakh tourists for surgical procedures, allopathic treatment, yoga, meditation, ayurvedic and other traditional remedies. This numbers grew to 32 la kh medical tourists in 2015.171Indian medical tourism is projected to reach nearly INR 55,000 crore by 2020, growing at 20 % annually from an estimated 20,440 crore in 2015 .172 Tapping into the healthcare opportunity can also generate jobs for the upcoming capital city. The number o f jobs generated for every acre o f land deployed in healthcare delivery is amongst the highest across sectors. Apollo hospitals alone engage over 70,000 doctors, nurses, paramedics, clinical sta ff and management pro fessionals to manage more than 9,500 beds in 167IBEF Healthcare January 2016 168Euromonitor report 169CII Re port on alternative medicine s 170IBEF Healthcare January 2016 171 Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industr y of India (Assocham ), 2011 172Ministr y of Health, RNC OS, KPMG, Deloitte, Medical Tourism Association, LSI Financial Services, Apollo Investor Presentation, TechSci Research, IBEF Healthcare January 201 6 Anchor sectors for Amaravati 9969 hos pitals.173, 174, 175The total demand for incremental man power for healthcare delivery from 2017 to 2022 is about 26 lakh, includin g nearly 19 lakh nurses and midwives .176 Quality healthcare is fundamental to Amaravati's vision of happiness and healthy living.

NTR VAIDYA SEVA SCHEME MAKES HIGH-QUALITY HEALTHCARE ACCESSIBLE TO THE MASSES The Dr. NTR Vaidya Scheme is a good example of a feasible and sustainable ecosystem which delivers universal health coverage to families below the poverty line using innovative programme planning and implementation. The scheme is designed to provide critical care for up to nearly 129 lakh poor families across all 13 districts of Andhra Pradesh. It aims to achieve equity and provide accountable and evidence-based care by joining hands with the private sector to deliver quality healthcare.1 The scheme provides a cover of up to INR 2.5 lakh per family per year for 1,044 in-patient procedures and follow-up care for the ensuing year.2 The fund is managed by Dr. NTR Vaidya Seva Trust, and the scheme is fully underwritten by the Government of Andhra Pradesh. The government health department reimburses empanelled hospitals for every procedure, with 35% reserved for the medical team (surgeon to class IV employee) and 65% for the hospital development society funds.3 Of the 546 hospitals empanelled under the scheme, 393 are private. To be empanelled, private hospitals are required to reserve 25% of their beds for patients under the scheme. Despite the comparable quality of healthcare, the cost of procedures under the scheme remains 25% to 50% lower than the prices outside the scheme. Since the advent of this programme, service providers have been able to deliver the same efcacy and quality of healthcare at lower prices through efcient cost management. Andhra Pradesh has already integrated telemedicine and its employees' health scheme into this scheme. With suitable incentives, private healthcare service providers could be encouraged to participate in the growth of Amaravati. This can include building and developing hospital infrastructure and setting up medical teams to operate facilities in the new capital city region. 1 Dr. NTR Vaidya Seva Trust webpage and 46% India, 19 June 2015, Vishakhapatnam, NTR Vaidya Seva Trust giving grief , accessed online Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 104Healthcare provider segments and focus for Amaravati191 The healthcare set up can be broadly classied into the following ve segments. 1. Corporate chains provide large-scale per unit capacity with hospitals across multiple cities and each hospital having a capacity of 100 to 500 beds. Accounting for 5% of the hospital in patient capacity in India in 2010 with nearly 80,000 beds, this segment is estimated to grow at a rate of almost 14% per annum to 12% of the estimated 30 lakh hospital beds by 2022. Critical care is at the core of the segment's competency with 20-25% beds dedicated for this purpose. Amaravati will strive to attract the leading providers and corporate chains in this segment to setup in the city. 2. Large standalone hospitals known for clinical excellence play a vital role in urban areas. These hospitals offered over 176,000 beds in 2010 and are estimated to increase their share in overall patient beds by 4% to 15% by 2022. These hospitals are funded mostly by trusts created from personal holdings and managed by a board or the founder. The state government can work with these founders and boards to help build hospitals in the capital. 3. Medium-sized standalone hospitals include small hospital chains with 50-100 beds in each facility and largely serve urban and suburban areas. With less than 5% of beds for critical care, these hospitals focus on primary and secondary healthcare with some facilities for emergency care. Amaravati may help set up doctor- and entrepreneur-driven hospitals to cater to mass demand. 4. Nursing homes offer the largest capacity with over 6 lakh beds, but with fewer than 50 beds each, mostly are owner- and doctor-driven with negligible tertiary or critical care capability. Nursing homes play a signicant role in upgrading care in individual locations. These mini hospitals are estimated to contribute 43% of hospital beds by 2022, up from 38% in 2010. Amaravati may help set up doctor- and entrepreneur- driven nursing homes to serve neighbourhoods within a 1-2 km radius. 5. Public hospitals from district hospitals to medical colleges, account for nearly 6 lakh beds. These facilities have high utilisation, with 5 to 8% of beds for critical care and on average one operation theatre for every 50 beds. Each hospital has capacity of 50-1,000 beds. Public hospitals are planned to provide care on par with private providers. Facilities are planned to be developed in line with the demand of the growing population and the city's vision of wellbeing. 191 CII McKinsey healthcare report; Annual reports; ROC lings Anchor sectors for Amaravati 105Top needs of healthcare providers and how Amaravati can meet them Four main factors make a location favourable for healthcare delivery providers: /g20/g17Local unmet demand: Research shows that over 40% of healthcare demand derives from the local catchment area within a 50 km radius of a hospital.192 The characteristics of the local population, including density and demand-supply gap, form a deciding factor for hospitals looking for a place to build. One study found that population density is the \u0001 second-most important factor for the health care provider in deciding a location for a new \u0001 hospital.193 Amaravati is expected to be one of the fastest-growing cities in India with a projected \u0001 population of 3.5 to 6 lakh in the first 10 years. Given the greenfield nature of the city, this \u0001 growing population will provide unmet demand for quality healthcare. /g21/g17Cost of land: Given the economics of healthcare, the cost of land poses a significant upfront \u0001 constraint for providers. It is found that this is the most important factor when deciding \u0001where to set up in a new location. In addition to outright land cost, the topography of the land and maintenance costs can also have significant impacts on the overall costs of construction and operation.194 Amaravati can to partner with quality healthcare service providers to offer encumbrance-free land at equitable costs which could allow for a viable operation in the city. /g22/g17Location and connectivity: Factors such as availability of transport, scope for future growth \u0001 and infrastructure quality remain key enablers. Amaravati is planned to be a well-connected city with a nearby airport, India's second busiest railway junction about 20 km away, two \u0001 national highways and proximity to the leading cities of Hyderabad, Bangalore and Chennai. /g23/g17Social infrastructure, liveability and the ability to attract talent: World-class medical teams including expert doctors, skilled nursing staff and well-trained support and management \u0001staff are essential to any hospital. The provider's ability to attract and retain talent in the city \u0001 depends on factors such as social infrastructure and liveability. Amaravati, pursuing its vision of CFJOH\u0001POF\u0001PG\u0001UIF\u0001UPQ\u0001UISFF\u0001IBQQZ\u0001DJUJFT\u0001HMPCBMMZ , is aimed to offer a\u0001unique living experience for healthcare professionals and their families. With schools within\u0001walking distance, low crime rates, abundant greenery and recreation and distinctive retail, entertainment and dining options, the city is expected to be a preferred location to raise a\u0001family. The city aims to promote the setup of medical colleges and training facilities to offer \u0001 healthcare providers with a local talent pool. 192 Industry expert 193 Potential Hospital Location Selection using AHP: A Study in Rural India; Debmallya Chatterjee; June 2013 194 Ibid.

While a heart bypass costs about INR 3.5 lakh in India , it can cost 25 times more in the US , six times more in Korea , three times more in Thailand and twice as much in Malaysia. On an avera ge, the cost of these procedures in India is 80% lower than in develo ped countries .198While bypass sur gery has a si gnicant cost advanta ge in India, the mar gin is slimmer for other procedures than in other popular medical tourism destinations such as Thailand and Mala ysia. With only a small share of tourism from develo ped countries, India attracts over 60% of its medical tourists from Af ghanistan, Ban gladesh, Africa, Gulf countries and the CIS.199 Implementation plan for Amaravat i With its vision o f happiness and health, Amaravati aims to emerge as one o f India's leading hubs for medical tourism with a special focus on natural therapies such as Ayurved, Yoga, Naturopathy and Homoeopathy and niche o fferings such as luxury healthcare. 197Transformative Evolution: From 'wellness' to 'medical wellness' tourism in Kerala, A white paper on the trends and recommendations for enhancin g medical value tourism in the State of Kerala; CII-Grant Thornton ; October 2015. 198Cost comparison study by the American Medical Associatio n 199CII - Grant Thornton white paper, 2015Figure 38: Cost of surgeries in of Health; KPMG; Deloitte; Medical Tourism Apollo investor presentation; TechSciResearchINR '000,2014 Note: Fi are bypass669.8 50.2334.9 rep sectors for Amaravati 109 Through concerted public-private e fforts, the city plans to o ffer at least one or two JCI - accredited facilities and develop the end-to-end ecosystem required to attract medical tourism such as tie-ups at a government level, travel support for incoming tourists, global connectivity and world-class infrastructure.

This would ensure that the People's Capital not only serves its own healthcare needs but also becomes a pre ferred healthcare destination for patients from India and abroad. B. AYUSH\u2014Traditional healthcare remedies Overview for India The market for AYUSH consists of both over-the-counter traditional cures and su pplements such aschyawan prash , massa ge oils and di gestive supplements, as well as lifestyle and wellness centres such as naturopathy clinics and centres for yo ga and ayurvedic massa ge. In 2015, the country's rou hospitals allopathic streams of healthcare comprisin yo ga, naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, homoeo pathy and SOWA-RIGPA.200 Strong support from 484 educational institutions, lower costs o f establishment with high operating margins, tax incentives from the government and the general perception of fewer side effects compared to allopathy are the key growth drivers for AYU SH. Three-fourths of this therapy market is in areas such as rheumatolo gy, dermatolo gy and oncolo gy, where allopathic treatment o ften uncertain and expensive .201 Competitive landscape, challen ges and key success factors The AYUSH healthcare market is fra gmented. Select companies produce traditional over - the-counter formulations and the su pplements market is served by smaller com panies and individual practitioners. 200Press Information Bureau, Government of India, AYU SH, 08-March-2016; This information was given by the Minister of State for AYUSH (Independent Char ge) and Health & Family Welfare, Shri Shripad Yesso Naik in reply to a question in the jya Sabha, reported in for Amaravati 110 \"India has a distinct cost advantage with world-class hospitals and skilled medical professionals.\"The AYUSH healthcare delivery market com prises of four ty pes of players: a.Small private hos pitals and mana gement center s d.Government AYU SH centers. One of the most prominent providers is the over 100 year-old Arya Vaidya Sala (AVS) in Kottakkal, includin g a 350 bed hospital which produces over 530 types of medicines. This establishment has an annual turnover upwards o f INR 300 crore and a sta ff of over 2,200. Though annual revenue growth is below 10 %, the brand has steadily expanded; 70 % of revenues come from medicine sales at more than 2 ,000 dealers and 27 clinics across the country.202 Newer entrants have grown quickly, includin g Dr. Batra's Homeopathy with revenues of over INR 150 crore in 2013-14 ,203 and Patan jali Ayurvedic Limited with revenues of INR in 2015-16 (includin g FMCG products).204,205 The Patanjali Ayurveda Hospital is an AYU SH facility with a 100 bed in-patient department .206 The increasing international traction of the AYUSH segment can also be assessed from the fact that traditional business houses have shown interest in building capabilities in traditional healthcare. Yash Birla acquired a 51% stake in to form Birla Kerala Ltd announced Vaidya Pharmacy, the second-lar gest ayurvedic company in South India after AVS .207 202Hindu Business line Report, 'Kottakkal aims for expansion in North India ' 203Dr. Batra's news section, 'Dr Batras group is funded throu gh internal accruals ' 204 Mint, 27 A pril 2016, New Delhi, 'Patanjali plans to leave its bigger competitors behind soon' 205 The Navhind Times , 10 November 2014 ;'Dr Batra's group is funded through internal accruals ' 206Divya we bsite 207Business Standard, 'Yash Birla in tal ks to buy two ayurveda com panies ' Anchor sectors for Amaravati 111 Policy support The AYU SH ministry has been pushing policy in India and abroad to create an ecosystem for traditional healthcare in India.

These initiatives are intended to enhance the acceptability o f Indian traditional medicines locally and internationally and to create an ecosystem for AYU SH through education, skill development, workshops and exchange programmes.209 AYUSH in Amaravati AYUSH is widely accepted in Andhra Pradesh as part of National Rural Health Mission. Amaravati could build on Andhra Pradesh and Telengana's combined AYU SH healthcare delivery in frastructure comprising nine colleges with over 500 seats and 19 hospitals with over 1,300 beds, with the new state capital re gion as its new centre.210 With a focus on speci c therapy areas, supplement manu facturing using natural herbs from the vicinity, and specialised R &D, Amaravati may emerge as a thriving hub for this discipline in India and internationally.

Telemedicine\u2014A panacea for remote areas In 1999, the non-prot Apollo Telemedicine Networking Foundation set up the rst rural telemedicine centre in Aragonda. Andhra Pradesh remains the country's pioneer in technology- driven healthcare delivery.211 This telemedicine network model was adopted nationally and expanded through a lakh common service centres (CSCs) and participation from private healthcare groups across the country in 2013. In Andhra Pradesh, 112 CSCs were supported by the ATNF,212 which has since facilitated more than 71,000 tele-consultations in 25 medical disciplines, bridging the gap between patients and the care they need.213 With better networks, the introduction of 4G, and penetration of smartphone and virtual-reality technology, telemedicine has been gaining traction. By drastically reducing the cost of care and reaching remote areas, telemedicine is transforming healthcare in rural communities. In 2015, the central government launched an ambitious pan-India telemedicine-based health initiative called Social Endeavour for Health and Telemedicine (Sehat) that could deliver geography-agnostic healthcare, especially to people in rural areas. Using CSCs as the remote- location-driven model to deliver basic, specialty and super-specialty consultations, the initiative covers up to 80% medical conditions.214 Amaravati will explore opportunities to promote telemedicine delivery centres which may provide care for not only the region but also the state and nation. 211 Apollo Telehealth Website 212 Governance Now, 'Telemedicine Reality' 213 Plan for Amaravati 114 2.2.6. Higher education What is exciting about education in India India has the world's lar gest population under the a ge of 24 - nearly 600 million in 2012, accordin g to the NSDC. By 2022, about 63% of the population will be of workin g age, between 15 and 59, but they will face a stark education decits. Only 2% of Indians a ged 20 to 24 are colle ge graduates today, and fewer than 15% a ged 15 to 19 have more than hi gher secondary schoolin g.215To keep pace in a global economy that is movin g quickly towards hi gh-tech and knowled ge work, India needs to expand hi gher education alon g with trainin g and skill development pro grammes. India now s pends about INR 600 billion216on higher education eac h year, an d could spen d more than 1.2 trillion by 2020 i f growth continues at historic rates o f about 13% annually .217 Demand for education is being driven by rising incomes and an expanding population ages 15 to 24. Measures to increase the supply o f quality higher education include legislative reforms to increase private-sector participation, the emergence o f models such as PPPs, and growing government spending. In fact, the growing number o f private equity deals since 2009, amounting to more than INR 550 crore,218indicate private esta blishments ' growing interest across the education sector, from primary schools to vocational training and coaching. Creating an education zone in Amaravati can o ffer strategic bene ts, including signi cant spill- over e ffects for other industries. The education sector creates high-quality jobs - pro fessors earn an average o f INR 20 to 25 lakh per annum. It brings in new residents, as each acre results in 30 to 50 jo bs per acre plus 200 to 250 students per acre.219This drives demand f or residential property alon g with retail, entertainment, and dinin g facilities, where students and professors tend to s pend more than blue-collar workers. This sector can also s pur develo pment by attractin g and developin g the kind of talent that appeals to industries and fuels the economy . Andhra Pradesh is a forerunner in hi gher education with a le gacy of top universities. It is amon gst the top six states for en gineerin g, for example, accountin g for about 65% of all intake. The state passed the AP Private Universities Act in 2015 - path-breakin g legislation which eases the process of settin g up credible private hi gher education establishments. One of the most forward-lookin g higher-education laws in the country, the Act permits universities to receive approval in about 140 days based on recommendations from an a ppointed panel of ex perts. Amaravati is envisioned as a hub for to p-tier universities with a focus on providers which are multi-disci plinary or renowned in an anchor sector. The city plans to ex plore collaboration with leadin g international education providers as well. A model for new-a ge education, the city aims to promote innovative delivery models such as online, hybrid and eld-and-forum courses, to bring world's best professors to Amaravati throu gh virtual classrooms. To attract faculty and 215Human Resource and Skill Requirements in the Education and Skill development sector (2013-17, 2017 22 ), NSDC/KPMG sectors for Amaravati 115students, the city will need to be highly liveable and o ffer a strong social in frastructure, dining and entertainment, etc. Higher education segments and focus for Amaravati Higher education may be segmented into seven broad archetypes by discipline: 1.Multidiscip linary universities : Universities such as Manipal, SRM in Chennai, Amity in Noida, and BIT S in Pilani are successful private multi-disciplinary universities which attract students and faculty and drive economic activity in their areas. Each requires at least 30 acres and attracts an average 300-350 students and 15-20 faculty per acre .220 2.Commerce co lleges: Requiring 2-15 acres of land, commerce colleges, such as Shri Ram College o f Commerce in Delhi, Narsee Monjee College o f Commerce and Economics in Mumbai, and Symbiosis College of Arts and Commerce in Pune, contribute greatly to local employment. These attract about 400 students and 20-25 faculty per acre .221 3.Design, hospita lity and anchor sector universities : The National Institute o f Fashion Technology, Symbiosis Institute of Design, Institute of Hotel Management, and Institute of Apparel Management help provide workers with skills for anchor industry sectors. Requiring only 2 to 4 acres, these schools can house 200-300 students and 10-15 faculty per acre.222 4.Medica l institutes: A medical college can help drive a local economy. 'It increases economic activity and generates employment, which in turn ma kes government and private players to develop in frastructure like roads, housing, shopping complexes and markets,' according 220Industry experts 221 Ibid. 222 Ibid.Figure39: The education sector is pro jected to grow at over 13 % SOURCE: NSDC;IBEF;NSSO66thRound ,2011-12;Industry experts600 480 290 2014E 2008 2012+13%p.a.India higher education market siz e INRbillions Key stat s 30 Average jobs/acre Average university size (acres)30-1500.09Indirect jobs multiplier (supply chain jobs ) Students per acre 150-200~1Avera ge income (INR lakh /yr) (million, cardiac sur geon and chairman, Narayana Healthcare Hospitals. The presence of medical students may also ins pire local children to pursue medical professions.223India has a hu ge decit of medical pro fessionals, with fewer than 400 medical colleges and about 50,000 MBB S seats .224 Due to their need for labs and operatin g theatres, medical institutions require lar ger areas for the same number of students and faculty, ty pically 10-15 acres each with 75-100 students and 7-10 faculty per acre. But because they usually ad join hospitals, these schools create value for providers.225 5.Engineerin g: Top private en gineerin g colle ges such as BITS Pilani and Vellore Institute o f Technolo gy produce a continuous stream of skilled graduates. Coverin g 10-30 acres each, engineerin g colle ges usually have a 10:1 student/teacher ratio, with 15 to 100 students and 1 to 10 faculty per acre.226 6.Business schools (for masters' de grees): Between 1988 and 2010 , the number of business schools grew 16-fold, with more than 5 lakh seats now available .227 Business sch ools attract only about 5 to 30 students and 1 to 5 faculty per acre, however, and re quire at least 10 acres.228 7.Liberal arts: Liberal arts such as Ashoka , OP Jindal Global , and the Foundation for Liberal and Mana gement Education, have attracted investment, but much needs to b e done to raise awareness about these universities and courses to remunerate top graduates in line with those in other disciplines such as en gineerin g, medicine and business. Spannin g more than 30 acres, these universities ty pically have a 5:1 student teacher ratio with over 30 students and 2 faculty per acre.229 Considering headcount per acre, Amaravati may want to focus rst on four segments: Commerce colleges, multi-disciplinary universities, design universities and medical colleges. Amaravati could also work to attract top-tier universities for each anchor industry to enhance positive spill-over e ffects. 223 Times of India, 'A medical colle ge is a booster for healthcare and economy ' 224New Indian Ex press, 'Private companies to set up medical colleges ' 225 Ibid. 226Ibid. 227ASSOCHA M 228Ibid. 229 Business Standard, 'Liberal arts education ex pands presence in India' Anchor sectors for Amaravati 117 Trends driving growth in this sector Five power ful trends are driving growth in the educational sector: 1.A large youth popu lation: India has more young people than almost any other country - nearly 600 million are under the age o f 24, about hal f the population.230 230NSD CFigure40: Segmentation of colle ges in India by owners hip and field of stud y SOURCE: A ll India d commerce Total = ~21 ,158Number of colleges as of 2011 -12 (mana gement wise)Segmentation of India's over 22,000 colle ges by fields of study (2011 ) Figure 41:Key parameters o f different educational provider types SOURCE: Industry experts; press searc hNote: A bove parameters are estimates based on typical providers an d may vary on a cas e-to-case basisEducational stream Commerce co llege Multi-disciplinary university Other institutes - design,hospitality, etc. Medical colle ge Engineerin g Liberal arts universit y MBASize re 2-15 acres At least 30 acres 2-4acres 10-30 acres At least 30 for higher education: The Central Government's spending on higher education increased from 13.5% of the total spending on education (by MHRD) in 2007-08 to about 20% in 2012-13.231 The new 'Skill India' initiative will train 400 million people for employment by 2022.232 Key programmes include:233 i. Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana - Provides nancial rewards as incentives to participants upon successful completion of skill training ii. National Policy for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship 2015 -Develops skills and promotes entrepreneurship through an integrated programme iii. Skill Loan Scheme - Provides loans for skill development with the goal of reaching 3.4 million Indians by 2020 iv. National Skill Development Mission - Expedites skill development by providing a robust institutional framework at the centre and the state. Through these measures, the government aims to increase the gross enrolment ratio to 30% by 2030, for a total of 25 million additional seats. An investment of about 13.5 lakh crore will be required to achieve this target.234 3.Increased private sector participation: The share of private sector spending across segments could increase from 45% in 2007 to over 50% by 2017, with about 73% of the colleges managed by private players.235 4.International investment: Highly regarded foreign universities are looking at programmatic collaborations with Indian universities. The NITI Aayog, for example, recently made recommendations to the Prime Minister's Ofce and Ministry of Human Resource Development to help foreign universities set up campuses in India. It detailed three routes to entry: a) a new law to regulate the operation of such universities in the country; b) an amendment to the UGC Act of 1956 and deemed university regulations to let them in as deemed universities; c) Facilitating their entry by tweaking University Grants Commission and All India Council for Technical Education regulations on twinning arrangements between Indian and foreign institutions to permit joint ventures.236 Foreign Direct Investment in Indian education has been over INR 76 billion from April 2000 to September 2015 with an annual growth rate of over 18%.237 Noted institutes have already launched facilities and programmes, including the University of Chicago's research centre in Delhi, Virginia Tech in Tamil Nadu, and Harvard Business School in Mumbai.238 231 Human Resource and Skill Requirements in the Education and Skill development sector (2013-17, 2017-22), NSDC/ KPMG report 232 Economic Times, 'Government to train 40 crore people under Skill India initiative' 233 Business Standard, 'India launches mission to skill 400 million by 2022' , 2015 234 EY Report 235 NSDC Report 236 The Indian Express, 'Allow foreign university campuses, says Niti Aayog' , April 2016 237 IBEF, 2016 238 Live Mint, 'Foreign universities open India centres', 2016 Anchor sectors for Amaravati 1195. A shift towards technology-based delivery models: More schools are taking advantage of technological advances, including ICT and multimedia tools. And new delivery models have emerged, such as e-learning and m-learning through online courses, hybrid and blended learning combining in-person and online instruction, online open universities, and virtual reality and simulation labs. These advances are changing the education landscape, making it accessible to millions of people for the rst time, reducing the costs of delivery, and improving the learning process. Top needs in education and how Amaravati can meet them Amaravati will cater to key needs of education providers: 1. Ease of business: Universities value quick and streamlined licensing and permit processes. The AP Private Universities Act, the most forward-looking bill in India, allows universities to receive approval in about 140 days based on recommendations from an appointed panel of experts. 2. Economic activity in vicinity: Co-location with growing economic hubs is preferred as it provides internship and career opportunities to students. Amaravati is envisioned as one of the fastest-growing economic hubs which could generate nearly 4-6 lakh jobs over the next 10 years. 3. Social infrastructure: Top faculty will demand strong social infrastructure, including good primary and high schools, to relocate their families to Amaravati. Prospective students will also look for many of the same features, such retail options, entertainment and dining. Designed as per smart-city benchmarks, Amaravati will be able to offer world-class social infrastructure amenities, including waterfront dining and top-tier schools. 4. Connectivity: Convenient and well-maintained airports, roads and rail are required to ease travel for students, recruiters and faculty. Amaravati is well-connected to all major modes of transport and nearby Tier 1 cities - it has two highways and is about 50 km from the airport, about 20 km from the Vijayawada railway junction, and 300-600 km from Hyderabad, Chennai and Bangalore. 5. Availability of land: The cost and availability of encumbrance-free land will be deciding factors for institutions considering a move to Amaravati. Land prices will therefore need to be maintained at competitive levels to allow universities to be economically viable. Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 120Implementation plan for Amaravati To build a vibrant education hub, Amaravati plans to explore the following implementation ideas an d requirements : 1.Attract specialised education providers for anchor sectors: Talent is a key to attracting industries. Setting up top national and international institutes in electronics, engineering , textile, design, food processing, tourism and hospitality will increase the city's attractiveness to these anchor sectors. For example, Amaravati could consider setting up specialised institutes for textile design, such as NIFT, for electronics, such as BIT S, and agriculture and for food processing, such as the Agricultural Engineering College and Research Institute in Coimbatore. 2.Harness new-age delivery models for education : Universities and institutes worldwide are moving towards compact, high-density and modern multi-storey facilities catering to nearly 200-250 students per acre. Technology is also becoming a pervasive feature with emerging tech-enabled delivery models such as online, hybrid and virtual learning, such as IE's Online MBA and UCLA's hybrid courses. By bringing the world's best pro fessors to Amaravati through virtual classrooms powered by high-speed internet, the city can o ffer world-class, industry-relevant and a ffordable education.

MOOCs can be even more effective than traditional learning. Analysing 138 scholarly articles, Glance et al. (2013) found that online learning yields similar or better learning outcomes than traditional face-to-face teaching.242 Alan Krueger, former chairman of the US Council of Economic Advisors, explained, 'Online courses have a tremendous potential to raise living standards'. Experts say higher education is likely to undergo three disruptive changes as scalable online formats evolve into genuine alternatives to face-to-face teaching:243 1.Universalisation of access Online courses will reach underserved populations in developing countries Low tuitions for online courses will make university education more affordable More flexible timing will enable professionals to enrol in online courses 2.Emergence of elite content providers The best online courses will be used widely by students around the world Due to scale and network effects, a small group of providers will dominate the market Superstar teachers will command signicant premiums 3.Unbundling and rearrangement of value chain Students will bundle their own courses from multiple providers instead of enrolling for standardised degrees Universities will collaborate with private rms to deliver online content Non-traditional providers will compete with established universities in the online market. Delivery models and products are also exploding. Educators are using 'edutainment', for example, embedding lessons in television programmes, games, lms, music, websites, multimedia software, to reduce saturation and anxiety in learners and prevent dropouts. 'Flipped classrooms' providing activity-based learning are gaining popularity. And advances in machine learning are providing students with a personalised 'one-to-one tutor' experiences at a much lower cost. 241 International Institute for Public Policy Research, An Avalanche Is Coming, 2013 242 Glance, Forsey and Riley, 'The pedagogical foundations of massive open online courses', 2013 243 Bloomberg, 'Economist Krueger Says Online Courses May Boost Living Standards' , 2013 Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 124One potentially game-chan ging development is the advent of virtual reality in classrooms, which may transform the way people learn while reducin g costs. For example, Labster, a tech startu p, offers virtual reality laboratory simulator where students perform ex periments which are simulated to demonstrate what would ha ppen in the real world. This could not only transform learnin g but also allow universities to save millions on research costs by performin g virtual experiments before experimentin g in the real laboratory.

Development avenues for Amaravati Amaravati can pursue themes of healthy living, wellness and yoga to cater to different tourist proles by developing a range of facilities: 1.1 Resorts: Three categories of resorts could be developed in the region: Upscale resorts with indulgent features such as ayurvedic spas, yoga sessions, speciality restaurants and extensive customer service, situated on prime property, will appeal to affluent foreign and domestic tourists. A luxury resort with good product features and a range of service bundles could target domestic middle-class couples or families looking for a high-end vacation. Natural spas, couples yoga, immaculate service and ne dining could be available. To attract upper-middle-class to affluent families with kids, a luxury resort could offer large activity areas, yoga sessions, cultural shows, a variety of leisure activities and extensive childcare offerings. Such a destination would provide a family with a serene vacation for rejuvenation. These resorts could afliate with international councils, such as Resort Condominium International, USA, to earn quality ratings to attract foreign tourists. 1.2 Yoga resorts Yoga has been gaining worldwide prominence as a way to achieve spiritual calmness. An upscale yoga resort offering a variety of options, such as meditation, personal and family retreats, and celebrations of special events such as yoga day with highly trained gurus and mentors, can bring foreign and affluent domestic tourists for long stays. 1.3 Meditation centres and ashrams: Targeting domestic tourists for short programmes and local residents for longer programmes, these could help propagate the spirit of yoga now entering the mainstream consciousness. 1.4 Wellness centres: Wellness centres offering Ayurvedic, natural and beauty treatments and advice for healthy living can appeal to residents and tourists alike.

Buddhist resorts: A luxury resort for Buddhists from around the globe could offer retreat options on 20 acres close to the river just outside the city. Nature inspired TourismBudget hotels: Ten acres over different parts of the city can accommodate tourists and backpackers. Boating and water sports: Harbour and storage spaces for boats and other related equipment would require almost two acres. Island development: Landscaping and development of botanical gardens on nearby islands would require about 50 acres. Nature trail and campsite development: Setting up nature trails and campsite would require landscaping in nearby hills and valleys. Two acres would be enough for narrow trails, and ten for camping areas with amenities.139 Anchor sectors for AmaravatiTop infrastructure and support needs for Amaravati To turn the tourism vision of Amaravati into reality, the government will need to lead development of the region with private sector support. The potential steps for Amaravati are: Core infrastructure Improvements in international flight connectivity will be crucial. Andhra Pradesh now has one international and four domestic airports Historic and nature-related sites need to be fully developed Information centres need to be created at key historic and cultural centres. Policy support Institutional mechanisms need to be developed to regulate, oversee and shape the growth of the industry Legal infrastructure needs to be analysed and new mechanisms put in place to support the industry Incentivising the private sector The Government needs strong private sector support, especially to develop capital-intensive assets, such as hotels and convention centres. The region may host symposiums or conferences to educate private players about potential returns on investments in Amaravati Smaller entrepreneurs could also be invited to set up restaurants, budget hotels and retail kiosks in the city and near important tourist spots. Marketing and promotion Advertising campaigns can reach major domestic and foreign markets. Partnering with Incredible India initiative and Andhra Pradesh Tourism can also help improve reach of such campaigns Accreditation of hotels with agencies can reassure tourists about quality The region can cooperate and partner with popular travel operators to develop tourist circuits based on different. Support staff The city can create support structures such as tourist help centres, and provide vocational training for approved tour guides The city can encourage a range of private tour operators to set up ofces. 140 140 SSoocicioo--EcoEconnoommiic c MMasastteer r PPllaann for for AAmmaravarav aattii 141 Anchor sectors for Amaravati2.2.8. High-end services, including IT, financial services, and R&D What is exciting about high end services in India Information technology, IT engineering services (ITes) and nancial services are crucial sectors for India and Amaravati. India is the world's largest sourcing destination, accounting for around 55% o f the INR 9.8 lakh crore global IT market .249The IT business process management (BPM ) sector in India generates revenues about INR 1 lakh crore, and should grow at about 9% annua lly.250Indian IT providers char ge 3-4 times less than US providers, and cost continues to be the Indian industry's main competitive advanta ge in the global market - it has helped clients save over INR 13 lakh crore in the last ve years.251 India's IT industry accounts for 12.3% o f the global market mainly due to exports, which were valued at about INR 6.6 lakh crore in 2015 after growing at a compound annual rate of 13% from 2008 despite the global economic downturn .252 The sector generates about 200 jobs per acre with an avera ge income (white) of INR 5 lakh,253and it provi ded indirect emp loyment to about 10 million people in 2013-14. The government has supported this industry by providing tax holidays for STPI and SEZs and a liberal system for raisin g capital and seed money. It also approved a fund of INR 1 lakh crore to implement the Di gital India report pr ivate secto r indirect em ployment to ~10 mi llion peop le in 2013-14 (estimate d at a multiple of 3X)Direct emp loyment in IT-BPM industr y Million person market size Total revenue , INR billion sDistribution o f work force b y qualifications 46%5%30% 4%12% 3%Others Finance s pecialists (CA/CS )Engineering gra (other than Engg.) Post graduates (including MBAs )142Similarl y, the nancial services sector has evolved over the years to become a ke y driver of business growth. Assets under management grew by around 17% annually from 2008 to 2013.254It creates about 300 jobs per acre and an avera ge annual income of INR 4 lakh.255 In bankin g and non-bankin g nancial companies (NBFCs), back ofce and transaction processin g roles are expected to decline from 95% of the workforce in 2005 to 65% in 2020 while sales and business development roles will grow from 5% of the workforce to 35%, mostly throu gh entry-level hirin g. This creates si gnicant employment opportunities for business correspondents. The number of insurance a gents is also expected to grow quickly, especially in non-life and micro insurance. India's policy structure has been conducive to growth in the bankin g sector. New private banks are to be established between 2016-20, as RBI has given approval to 23 applicants and 2 domestic com panies to set u p new banks. Eleven payment banks are to be set u p to ex pand reach in rur al areas.256The government has also increased FDI limits in the insurance sector from 26 % to 49 % to facilitate investment.257 The high-end services industry needs well-educated people, access to electricity and good connectivity. One of Amaravati's key advantages is expected to be its access to talent given its closeness to the business hub o f Vijayawada and education hub o f Guntur. The V GTM region is re garded as AP's educational hub, with a host of institutions such as Acharya Nagarjuna University, Guntur Institute of Medical Sciences, and Vedic University. Graduate schools, colleges, and high schools also provide basic and higher education in the region. 254RBI, NSDC-KPMG re port 255Team analysi s Times, 'RBI noties hike in FDI ca p in insurance sector to 49%'Figure52: India financial services industr y: Overview Service; NSDC-KPMGreportIndia financial siz e Assets un der management, INR billionEmployment Million persons Banking & NBFCs /g402PSBsaccount for 73% o f workforce /g402Back office and transaction processin g roles to decline from 95% o f the work force in 2005 t o 65% in 2020 /g402Sales an d business development ro les to grow from 5% of workforce in 2005 to 35% in 2020, most ly through entry-level hiring /g402Significant employment opportunities for Business Correspon InsuranceBanking & NBFCs Insurance /g402Demand for entry level employees to reduce from 90% of workforce in 2 013 to 29% in 2022 /g402Team management role sto incre ase from 2% in 2013 to 24%in2022 /g402High growth in number o f Insurance a gents, especially those in non -life and is about 20 km from Vijayawada junction, the second-biggest in the country, and about 50 km from the Gannavaram airport. The region also has the potential to support the high-end services industry. This will also help in creating high-income white collar jobs that will lead to advancement o f its population. Segments and focus for Amaravati The IT-BPM includes four important segments: 1.IT services: With a market size o f about INR 5 lakh crore in 201 5258 and annual growth of 13-14%, this se gment accounts for 47% of the total revenue of IT-BPM industr y259. It includ es project-based services and network inte gration, software testin g), outsourcin g and mana ged services (application mana gement, IS outsourcin g), and support and trainin g. Over 67% of the revenue of this sector comes from the export market. Bankin g, nancial services and insurance (BFSI) is a key vertical with export revenues o f over INR 2 lakh crore durin g 2013, accountin g for 41% of total IT-BPM exports from India.260 Given Amaravati's proximity to education clusters and uninterru pted power su pply, this can be an important segment for the city. Development of top class incubation centres and research labs can make the re gion more attractive for well-educated individuals who are crucia l to this segment. 2.Business Process Mana gement: This se gment has a market size of nearly INR 1.8 lakh crore and accounts for 18% of total revenue of the industr y.261 Around 85% o f revenue o f this segment comes from export market and it is the largest segment in terms o f creating employment with 3.1 million jo bs.262 It involves dele gation of IT business processes to an external provider and thus, includes traditional BPO and business process as a service (BPaaS). Since BPO will need low skill workers, this may be an easier se gment to implement com pared to IT services . 258IBEF 2015 repor t 259Nasscom, NSDC 262 Ibid. \"With the region's advantages, Amaravati has the potential to effectively support high end services industry.\"1443.Packa ged software, ER&D and Product Development: This se gment accounts for 16% of the total revenue for the industry with a market size of roughly INR 1.6 lakh in 2015.263 Activities inc lude: Software development and cloud in frastructur e Management o f processes, in frastructure and equipment to create products and services R&D for development of hardware and software technologies (including CAD ) Offshore product development 4.Hardware :The hardware segment had a market size o f about INR 1.2 lakh crore in 2015.264 The domestic market accounts for a si gnicant share and is growin g as the penetration of personal com puters and la ptops rises in India.

The SMAC market is expected to grow to INR 15 lakh crore by 2020.268 Within SMAC, analytics and cloud are likely to be the biggest growth drivers. India's public cloud services market is expected to grow at about 33% in each of the next 2 years to about INR 7,000 crore by 2016 with IT players offering services across the board. 2.Digital India: The Government has approved a lakh crore rupees to implement the Digital India initiative, an effort to connect all villages and cities by broadband, develop smart cities and introduce eGovernance in every Government department. The industry body NASSCOM and vendors like Cisco are keen to work with the Government to tap the opportunity. Facebook and Microsoft have shown interest in partnering with the Government in providing last-mile connectivity. 3.Non-linear models: Indian IT providers can aggressively push non-linear models, such as raising revenues with fewer employees and product-driven growth. Revenue productivity per employee has grown by 10% to 20% over the last three years.269 Service providers are evolving from vendors to partners with risk-sharing revenue models, for example. They are betting on 'projects to platforms' for the next phase of growth, such as from 'FTE-based' to platform- and product-based delivery. A range of trends is changing the nancial services industry: 1.Alternative delivery channels including mobile, the internet, ATMs and telephones have emerged and could account for more than 84% of transaction volume by 2020.270 Insurance distribution is also poised to shift from agency-based to alternate channels. Thus, banks need to have skilled workers with cross-selling and networking skills. 2.Changing industry structure: The business share of public-sector banks has declined gradually with increasing competition from NBFCs in delivering banking services in rural and semi-urban areas. NBFCs should continue to grow faster than banks,271 and new specialist players and elds are emerging in the insurance industry. 3.Increasing role of technology: Technology is playing a more important role in nancial services, especially in a move towards more customer-oriented business models. As companies invest in advanced technology, their employees need additional education and training to use it. 268 IBEF 2015 report 269 Company annual reports, NASSCOM, press 270 NSDC report 271 Ibid.147 Anchor sectors for AmaravatiTop needs of providers and how Amaravati can meet them The high-end services industry can operate e ffectively where the following requirements are me t: 1.Access to ta lent: Well-educated people are essential to growth in this sector, and Amaravati will have good access to talent due to its closeness to Vijayawada, a business hu b, and Guntur, an education hub. The Vijayawada Guntur Tenali and Mangalgiri region is regarded as AP's educational hub, with a host o f higher educational institutions. It houses premier institutes including Acharya Nagarjuna University, Guntur Institute of Medical Sciences, and Vedic University, along with graduate schools and colleges where people study agriculture, the arts, engineering, management, me dicine, nursing, p harmaceutica ls, an d technology. 2.Connect ivity:This industry needs access to other cities by road, and many companies, especially multinationals, need to be close to an airport. Two national highways connec t Amaravati to Hyderabad and Machilipatnam, and it is 20 km from Vijayawada junction, the second-busiest in the country. It is only about 50 km from the Gannavaram airport, and a new airport is to be developed in Mangalgiri. 3.Government Incentives : The high-end services industry needs land leases and su bsidised land to reduce its capital requirements. It also needs viability gap funding in initial years to reduce operational expenditures and for low-skill service operations, which may equal wages. SEZ tax benets can further incentivise the industry. 4.Reliable in frastructure : Reliable power and telecommunications are musts for the IT and nancial services industry, along with disaster recovery centres which can scale up on short notice. Amaravati can full these needs due to assured power from the Vijayawada therma l power-station . 5.Developed social and commercial in frastructure: The biggest requirement for any services industry is skilled manpower. Developed socio-commercial in frastructure, including RED, MICE, healthcare, and education, are needed to attract and retain talent. With its unique location and proximity to important cities, Amaravati can serve as a good location for nancial services and the IT/ITes industry. \"The nancial services sector has evolved over the years and has become a key driver for business growth.\"148Implementation plan for Amaravati To build a hub for high-end services industry, the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority may explore the following steps: 1.Opportunistically tar get 'queen bees' and developers for space and 2.Prioritise PSUs in nancial services to kick-start development; in particular to set up an additional regional ofce to cater to bifurcated Andhra Pradesh 3.Approach IT, ITes and BPO majors to set up trainin g campuses and scalable disaster recovery cen tres 4.Develop a mega retail, entertainment and dining complex .

Government The Government is a critical rst anchor in Amaravati's development. As the administrative capital o f Andhra Pradesh, the city will house the people responsible for the functioning o f the state machinery. They include ministers, bureaucrats, the judiciary, departmental sta ff and the police. Most o f them are still based in Hyderabad, the shared capital o f Telangana and Andhra Pradesh until 2024, but more than 9,000 are expected to relocate to Amaravati across cadres over the next few months. This large-scale relocation must be smooth to transition governance mechanisms from Hyderabad to Amaravati. In this time o f flux, it will be necessary to retain talent who may drive the growth o f the state and strive to achieve the vision for Amaravati. All e fforts will be made to make this move seamless and com fortable, and to provide high-quality liveability in the city for its rst residents, in line with the vision. Making Amaravati a destination of choice for the government To emer ge as a preferred destination for government employees, the state capital would explore a ran ge of measures: Facilitating housing for employees To help government employees and their households relocate to Amaravati, the state plans to work to ensure an affordable hi gh standard of livin g. For example, the government will provide those movin g to Amaravati with a 30% housin g rent allowance (HRA), similar to the one in the Tier 1 cit y of H yderabad.272 The government is also in discussions with developers and nancers to help relocatin g staff buy homes . The state plans to provide government housin g for pre-specied cadres. The housin g will be desi gned as per international standards and will feature smart-housin g elements such as Fire Alarms and other safety systems, security and surveillance technolo gy, and buildin g mana gement systems, includin g smart meterin g. Development of Social Infrastructure and measures to improve lifestyle As em ployees settle into the new ca pital with their families, they will need su pport in terms o f policy and social infrastructure. For exam ple, families will consider the quality of education and admissions durin g the academic year before makin g the decision to move. Many employees will also wei gh the quality of healthcare and civic facilities, which play major roles in living standards. In line with the vision of Sin gapore-like liveability standards, Amaravati plans to invest in high-quality social infrastructure includin g schools, healthcare facilities, civic amenities and infrastructure from day one. The state will hel p nationally renowned schools and hos pitals set up in the capital. As the city evolves, rapid economic growth will also provide employment opportunities for workin g spouses relocatin g to the city. 272 30% HRA hike for sta ff who shi ft to Amaravati , Deccan Chronicle152To ease the stress of relocating families in the immediate term, the Government will also offer a ve-day week for employees moving to the Interim Government Complex at Velagapudi (excluding select departments). This will allow employees to balance family commitments as they settle in to the new city.273 State-of-the-art-workplace A central 900 acre area has been earmarked for construction of government buildings. A jury of six nationally renowned architects selected the designs for the Secretariat, Legislature Complex, High Court, Raj Bhavan and other important buildings created by Maki and Associates, Japan, an internationally renowned architecture rm. Maki has designed some of the most iconic modern buildings, including the United Nations Consolidated Building and Tower 4 of the World Trade Centre Redevelopment, both in New York, and Media Corp in Singapore.274 In addition to government buildings, the complex will include essential health and emergency facilities, landscaped parks, physical-tness facilities including sports clubs, riverfront entertainment and dining options, and a commercial complex with convenience and retail stores to meet daily requirements. The government complex at Amaravati is envisioned as an iconic facility which will contribute to the pride of the state of Andhra Pradesh and the nation. 273 The Hindu, '5-day week for staff relocating to Amaravati' , 24 May 2016 274 PTI.

Jobs, GDP and land-use 3.1. Forecasting decades of growth To grow its population, jobs and economic output, every city relies on interlockin g buildin g blocks. Com panies need land, physical infrastructure and talent to set u p shop and thrive, for example, alon g with a supportive government and access to suppliers and customers. Workers move their families to a city based on job opportunities, housin g prices, transportation system, schools, lifest yle, and man y other factors. Accurately forecastin g growth, especially for a unique new city, is therefore difcult, but Amaravati is bein g planned from the ground up to offer everythin g people and companies look for when they contem plate a move. With this in mind, and based on benchmarks set by the world's fastest- growin g cities, industry growth patterns, and conversations with more than a hundred experts across anchor sectors, growth in Amaravati's land development, jobs, population, and economic output was estimated over the next 20 to 30 years. Beginnin g with a review of about 1,300 cities, includin g their population growth from the 1950s, the research focused on 395, each with a current population of over 10 lakh, be ginnin g in the period when they had populations of 1.5-4.0 lakh. The most successful had ten-year growth rates avera ging about 12% annually. The research also included Gur gaon as a best-case example in India, which grew at about 15% annually. Amaravati's population can aspire to grow in this 12-15% range over the rst 10 years, assuming it ma kes the necessary investments in the right sequence to build a world-class city that attracts anchor companies, enthusiastic wor kers and top talent. With these elements in place, growth should be strong and steady for decades to come. 3.2. Land development Companies in each o f seven targeted industry sectors require land, which the city can sell to them to fund development. Based on global benchmarks and expectations for attracting anchor or 'queen bee' tenants, these businesses may require 800-1,400 acres over the rst three years, while the government itsel f builds on about 200-300 acres o f its 900 acre complex. Based on construction lag times and benchmarks set by high-per forming industrial parks, about 20% of anchor sector land is expected to be developed within 3 years. Over ten years, based on the typical S-curve of sales and development along with residential development, growth o f existing tenants, and completion o f the government complex, an additional 1,700- 3,000 acres could be monetised for job-creating sectors. Jobs, GDP and land-use156Signicant land will be developed to build social infrastructure to provide Amaravati residents with ahigh quality of life from the outset. This will include schools, hos pitals, public transit systems, emer gency services such as firefighters and police, and other civic amenities. Central to thevisionof /g69/g72/g76/g81/g74/g3/g82/g81/g72/g3/g82/g73/g3/g87/g75/g72/g3/g87/g82/g83/g3/g87/g75/g85/g72/g72/g3/g75/g68/g83/g83 /g92/g3/g70/g76/g87/g76/g72/g86/g3 /g74/g79/g82/g69/g68/g79/g79 /g92/g15 Amaravati will have many green spaces, large parks, sports facilities and waterfront promenades. The city will also boast world- classcultur alcentres in the form of museums, am phitheatres, convention centre , exhibitions , and galleries. Com panies will need l and to meet people's needs and attract new residents, such as hotels, resorts ,restaurants, community shoppin g centres, retail office spaces and malls. Like an ycityunder going major development, Amaravati will need to build stron g roots before it can full ymature andbear fruit. In the first phase, from 2016 to 2019, it will establish its identity as a destinati on like no other and a truly world-class city. It will be gin securin g investments for develo pment and cre ate infrastructure, includin g roads and flood mana gement systems, alon g witharetail , entertainment and dining district, before most new residents arrive. In phase 2,from 2019 to 2023 , the city is expected to establish a premium and be gin extractin g value.It canloop inmulti ple partners to create hi gh-value concepts and make the city even more attractive to talent , investors , and global businesses. Social and physical infrastructure can becomemore substantial and compellin g, spurrin g more residential development alon g with significant increases in real estate values. New high-end residential offerin gs can drive even higher premiums. In phase 3,the 'tippin g point' from 2023 to 2026, the city is planned to monetise the remainder of its land bank ,sellin g property at double or triple the prices it obtained at launch. It can extract all recurrin gincomes such as ads and si gnage, rentals, and operatin g and maintenance surplus to fund ongoing mana gement of the city. \" Jobs will form the strong roots required for long-term economic growth and a virtuous cycle that drives new waves of investment and talent\"Jobs, GDP and land-use 1573.3. Job growth Benchmarks suggest that in the rst three years of development, Amaravati can create 25,00040,000 jobs directly in the seven priority sectors and the Government, as shown in the gure, plus another 10,000-15,000 jobs in construction. This three-year burst of economic activity and investment will create 10,000-20,000 additional indirect or induced jobs in supply chains, services and other areas, such as restaurants and banks. For example, benchmarks from the World Input-Output Database show that each job in the electronics industry creates two to three other jo bs in supply chains and services. Food processing also creates more than one indirect job for every person employed directly in the industry. These jobs, and the incomes they produce, will form the strong roots required for long-term economic growth and a virtuous cycle that drives new waves o f investment and talent. By the end o f year 10, the seven priority sectors could generate 300,000-550,000 jobs, including 105,000-190,000 direct jobs, as shown in gure below. 3.4. Population growth Experience in other fast-growin g cities su ggests that Amaravati could have 305,000-600,000 residents by year 10. This estimate depends on how many people the city retains and how many choose to live in Vijayawada, Guntur and other areas in capital region. Research with more than 450 representative stakeholders showed that the retention ratio could range from 15-25%, calibrated against other recent green eld developments such as Clark Green City in the Philippines, which is close to Manila, the country 's largest city. Each worker in Amaravati could bring an average of 1.6 additional family members. Thus, the estimate is based on 300,000-550,000 jobs times a 15-25% retention rate, times a family multiplier o f 2.6, for a total population o f 350,000-600,000.

Growth in economic output By year 20, Amaravati could generate an annual gross domestic product of over INR 100,000 crore. This estimate, based on avera ge annual growth of about 9%, assumes that productivity will rise with the population and that the avera ge worker will become more productive in line with hist orical trends in India . This growth could put Amaravati in the same GDP cate gory as Pune, Chennai and other leadin g Indian cities , as shown in exhibit below.

Success factors Experience around the world shows that cities grow in distinct phases, and that population growth and land development go hand-in-hand with overall economic growth. The interlockin g elements that need to be in place for a city to reach its maximum growth potential include: Competitive land pricin g, especially in the rst phase. The earliest commercial and residential tenants face the most risk, and they will be reluctant to invest ca pital based o n hopes and ex pectations. Ease of doin g busines s is essential in attractin g investors and corporate leaders, since it helps them ram p up production quickly and lowers the risks of bureaucratic im pediments to growth. High-quality infrastructure, includin g reliable power and water at competitive rates, give business leaders condence that purchasin g, production and shippin g can be seamless and reli able. Proactive, well-orchestrated industr y outreach can hel p Amaravati connect with businesses lookin g for new places to invest and grow. Incentive packa ges from the state and national government to attract leaders in the seven targeted industries. Attractin g public-sector undertakin gs as rst movers to build momentum for develo pment. Buildin g skills in the talent pool to provide the workers companies need to grow.

The importance of excellent infrastructure cannot be overestimated. Social and commercial areas o f the city mustbe connected, accessible, sustainable, sa fe and secure. Amaravati will provide dedicated wal king and bicycle lanes, and multi-modal interchanges at all major centres to allow the free flow of trafc from all modes of tfransit. Social infrastructure, rr including recreational areas, clinics, shopping and commercial zones, will be inclusive, accessible to all andclose to goo d transportation routes. Anoptima l level and phasing of physical in frastructure development will be crucial for the socia l and residentia lzones,as it requires some large investments. Physical in frastructure includes tier-I in frastructure for the entire city and tier-II in frastructure for further connections to plots and farmland. Preliminary estimates suggest that capital investments o f INR 45,000 to 55,000 crore willbe require dover t henext 2 0 years.

Approach Selecting and phasing infrastructure projects requires projecting population estimates, land use patterns and key nodes of development over time. The team use a three-step process to estimate requirements and determine the phasing plan for development: Infrastructure demand modelling based on end-state and interim population projections and in line with best-in-class global benchmarks across asset classes, such as water consumption, and power requirements per capita Cost benchmarking for the infrastructure in line with quality specications needed for all asset classes based on expert interviews and global benchmarks Prioritisation and phasing of infrastructure development in line with growth projections. The team rened these requirements and estimates through quantitative analytics, expert consultations and multi-stakeholder workshops with relevant departments such as Transportation, Planning, Procurement, and Engineering. 4.3. Details of key infrastructure projects 4.3.1 Transportation and roads A well-planned, extensive transport strategy is the lifeline of a city. Most cities in India and across the world suffer from poor public transport facilities, congested roads, loss of thousands of man-hours every day due to traffic jams, health issues due to pollution and stress, delays in responding to emergencies and many other problems. To make Amaravati /g82/g81/g72/g3/g82/g73/g3/g87/g75/g72/g3 /g87/g82/g83/g3/g87/g75/g85/g72/g72/g3/g75/g68/g83/g83/g92/g3/g70/g76/g87/g76/g72/g86/g3/g74/g79/g82/g69/g68/g79/g79/g92 , the capital will be planned with the aim of making public transport a preferred choice with over 50% trip share, developing the city as India's most walkable and cycle- friendly city, and planning for well-connected congestion-free travel. The city will have a state-of-the-art Bus Rapid Transport System (BRTS) with more than 150 km of dedicated corridor over to allow fast and predictable transit. The city will operate electric buses with smart features such as Wi-Fi and GPS-tracking. Within three to ve years, the city will explore a world-class tram network which would be interlinked with the BRTS. Common stations will allow multi-modal linkages across the network. In the long run, the city will explore setting up a metro system based on demand. By investing in top-quality, reliable and efcient public transport systems, Amaravati will offer a credible alternative to private car ownership.The city will also need to offer up to 315 km of roads includin g: Priorit y road s to connect all villa ges and the key nodes of development. Spannin g 81 km, the roads will include a multi-lane fully developed top layer, green corridors, dedicated walkways and cycle paths, LED street li ghting powered by solar panels, and state-of-the-ar t utilit y tunnels . Other arterial and sub-art erial road s will connect the entire city, especially government buildin gs, existin g villa ges and land poolin g plots; they will also connect the city to re gional hubs. Planned as a dense network that will eventuall y cover 220 km, the roads will be develo ped in a phased manner over 10 or more years in line with demand. These roads will also include utilit y ducts. Regional roads will connect Amaravati to key hubs in the re gion, namely Man galagiri, Vijayawada and Guntur. Spannin g 31 km, a new road from Guntur to Mothadaka-Tullur will be constructed, and the existin g four roads connectin g the main cities will be up graded .Figure 63: Transport: Vision and key elements SOURCE: APCRD Aplannin gEfficient public transport and aimin g for a zero acc ident c itywith over 50% pu blic transport useand over 80% o f city covered within 500 m of bus sto ps /g402Dedicatedbicycle lanes an d walking pat hsalong100% ofroads /g402Public bicycle sharing system, with stations at a ll multi-modal modes, e. g., bus/ tram stopsWalking/cyclin g /g402Dedicated public trans port corrido r along see d access an d sub-arterial roads-165km buses for twokey initial phase - ~20 km /g402Mobile app to provi de riders wit h real-time transit in formatio nPublic trans port /g402Electric rickshawsmandated for city /g402Multi modal integration with public transport - e.g.,auto stands at all BRT S bus stop sIndividual travel Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 164 \"The capital will be planned with the aim of making public transport a preferred choice with over 50% trip share\"A high-level phasing o f road development is shown below, along with cost estimates : Component SpecicationsApproximate construction cost over 20 years (INR crore) Priorit y road s 81 km of network grid connectin g existin g villa ges and 4,500Other arterial & sub-arterial r oads234 km of other arterial and sub - arterial roads (min RoW is 50 m) , demand-driven com pletio n Demand-driven completion: Full-width gravel lanes of bitumen.

Amaravati aspires to provide assured power, 24x7 with 99.99% reliability - the best per forming city for power in India. This could be achieved throu gh capital investment of over INR 2,100 crore in the next three years for transmission and distribution. A supply of 1,000 megawatts is assured from the Vijayawada Thermal Power station for the rst 10 years, and expansion of generation sources is planned in line with growth in demand. To estimate the demand for power over the next 15 years and beyond, benchmarks of peak demand per capita in cities across India and around the world were analysed. Taking into account increases in population according to the socio-economic master plan, generation needs were estimated at 1,000 MW. These may be revised based on actual demand and industry mix . In the rst three years, only transmission and distribution will be expanded. The principal features o f this hi ghly reliable power system are interconnections to a sin gle grid and double- circuit connections across the road network in the city. Amaravati is planned to be India's rst large-scale city with 100 % under ground power distribution and 100 % smart meterin g. More than 20% of the city's power requirements will be met with solar sources. Smart elements will be incorporated for higher reliability, better monitoring and more eco- friendly consumption. They will include a distribution automation SCADA system, a smart grid beginnin g in the Government Complex and LED street li ghting across the city. The smart grid will integrate solar power, waste-to-energy and thermal power. Civic facilities such as street lights will be tted with sensors to minimise consumption. The city can up grade its power generation and distri bution in the years ahead to meet risin g industria l, commercia l and residentia l deman d.

Its main components to are reliable supply through a 100% piping system and e ffective demand management in treatment. The main sources o f water for Amaravati are the River Krishna, Kondaveeti Vagu and other channe ls and other unconventiona l sources suc h as harveste d rainwater an d treate d water for irrigation. Considering growth in population and industry, Amaravati is estimated to consume 120-150 million litres per day for the next 10 years. The city could use a range o f methods to meet those needs in a sustaina ble manner, including: Sensor loggers to detect lea ks in the pipe networ k Real-time data capture at city, zonal and household levels for demand management and leak detection through SCAD A Smart meters in every house hold and predictive ana lytics to improve water managemen t Extensive rain water harvesting network to increase recycling and reuse o f water from day 1.

Based on population projections and ur ban guidelines, solid waste volumes are estimated at 700-750 million tonnes per year. As a green eld city, Amaravati aims to adopt best practices in solid waste management from day one. In inte gration with conventional collection, the city can plan for a waste disposal system, se gregation at the source, and up grades to the main parts of the city with automated waste collection. New, state-of-the-art transfer stations and waste-to-ener gy stations are planned for the outskirts of the city to recycle as much as possible.

Initially, the roads can be o f basic speci cation in line with demand and to ease movement o f construction vehicles and prevent losses due to damage as a result o f this activity. As demand increases, permanent world-standard in frastructure can be provided for all the land-pooling scheme acreage across the city. The total investment can be spread over the term o f the land-pooling scheme. The initial investments can be in the road networ k, starting with a gravel two-lane road for access and then bitumen top roads provided village-by-village as land is allocated to farmers along with access to construction power, water, sewage treatment and basic storm water drains. As development and population increase across villages, the in frastructure could be expanded and upgraded to the end-state speci cations including 100% underground utilities (rst in India ), last-mile bre-optic connectivity, an extensive re hydrant system and high-quality landscaping and green wor ks.

To help government employees and their families settle comfortably in the new capital and ensure a smooth and timely transition of government functions, building soft infrastructure and government housing will be high priorities. All government buildings will be equipped with smart housing features will include safety systems such as re alarms, security systems such as surveillance technology, smart metering technology and facility management systems. In addition to being the seat of government, the complex will be a popular hub for tourists and residents for culture, events, entertainment and dining. The visitor management system will include kiosks and hotspots, and a command and control centre to manage safety and trafc.

To improve the wellbeing o f residents, t hecityneeds to build high-quality pu blic schools, degree colleges, universities, hospita ls, health centres and community centres apart from Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 174 other civic amenities. Three multi-speciality hospitals have been planned for the rst 10 years, and each township has been designed to include a health centre, school and degree college. Key principles adopted during planning are: A. Public education Model schools to have staff and infrastructure at par with private institutions All neighbourhoods to have primary schools within 400 metres Three models to co-exist: Government-built and operated, government-built and leased to private institutions or trusts, and fully private with land subsidies More than 1,800 acres to be allocated for primary and secondary education B. Public health Each township to have a health centre and emergency healthcare facilities no more than 5-10 minutes away One state-of-the-art 30-bed sub-district hospital to be set up immediately and another over the next 2 years for secondary care A service monitoring system will help manage performance and capture data for all Primary Healthcare Centres and Community Healthcare Centres 300 acres to be set aside for public health facilities This social infrastructure can be ramped up in line with demand: Component SpecicationsApproximate construction cost over 20 years (INR crore) Schools 100 schools of 925 square metres each 1,900-2,500Health centres Health centres of 450 square metres each Super-speciality hospitalsState-of-the-art healthcare facilities Public buildings Libraries, convention centres and other public buildings Infrastructure 175 4.3.12 Flood management Amaravati lies in medium to low flood risk areas, mainly because o f its proximity to the River Krishna and rain fall in the Kondaveeti Vagu catchment area. Flood management works will be critical to sa feguard the city from this risk, and flood waters when managed well, may be put to use in t he city .

Phasing of infrastructure and trigger-based development Infrastructure investments are planned to be phased 6-12 months in advance of demand requirements to meet investor and citizen needs without delay while optimising cash flows. The rst phase requires signicant upfront investments, however, to build critical infrastructure such as trunk roads and distribution networks to kick-start development. Development in the rst phase can stimulate economic and job growth, but the city must be prudent about not overspending on 'ghost infrastructure' not required by investors or citizens immediately, which could place the city's long-term nancial viability at risk. By planning each phase carefully and revising plans regularly in line with demand, Amaravati can balance its spending while meeting world-class infrastructure standards. **All capacity and cost estimates are preliminary and may be revised based on technical evaluation, changes in demand or design, inputs from infrastructure master planners and nancing sources.** Infrastructure 179 4.5. Retail, entertainment and dining Development of the new capital city has two key objectives: Attractin g new residents not just with facilities and infrastructure but with a vibrant lifestyle; and kick-startin g economic activity in the re gion to generate employment as well as entrepreneurial spirit . Projections in the socio-economic master plan of Amaravati and historical development of greeneld cities show that in the rst 10 years, a lar ge share of people in the city will be 'floatin g' - they will visit Amaravati but not reside there. Buildin g a distinctive retail, entertainment and dinin g (RED) precinct can help achieve the main objectives for Amaravati in the initial years and attract the floatin g population to spend more time and money in the city. The RED precinct will act as a great 'social anchor' attractin g citizens from across Vijayawada, Guntur and the Capital Re gion who will be keen to visit and eventually move to Amaravati because it offers more o pportunities and a better lifestyle . In the meantime, the floatin g population will boost economic viability and a hi gh-quality social infrastructure for the xed population, even durin g the initial years of growth.Figure 71:Retail, Enterta inment, SOURCE: APCRD Aplannin g/g402Indoor gaming and cultural center over /g402Outdoor events and activities over 150,000sqftover 5.5acres /g402Water r 12-15 acres sqfte a c h -mix of street food,high-end restaurants, open cafes, etc. /g40220,000 sqftover 1 acres riversi footfall of 8,000-10,000 per da yby fifth year, access to retail outlets withinwalking distance (400 m )for 95% of areas and IRR o f 16-18%for 0.5acresRetail /g4023acresmulti-purpose convent ionandexhibitions hall, center hole course across 120-180acres with cl ub house, drivin g range, s over 3-5 acres includin ggym, pool, indoor games, dinin /g402Community center and library across 2-5 acresOther s Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 180 4.5.1. Key principles in developing the precinct In developing its offering to citizens, the city should follow ve key principles to build success from an early stage: 1.Dene the character of the precinct in advance and align all development accordingly. The RED precinct in Amaravati has been envisioned as: 'A modern twist to Amaravati which is young, buzzing, full of surprises and curated to the needs of all families and individuals' 2.Incorporate place-making at multiple levels: The overall development should include enough space for good experiences, such as jogging trails, walking areas and benches. 3.Programme the offering: Curate events according to the needs and requirements of citizens and schedule a regular set of activities. These could include a few marquee iconic events per year, such as theatre or food festivals, that attract visitors from beyond the local region. 4.Provide exceptional experiences: Each day should end with a 'wow' moment, such as the lights at the fountain at Burj Khalifa, Dubai. CASE STUDY: DOWNTOWN DUBAI'S EMERGENCE INTO A PULSATING SOCIAL DISTRICT Downtown Dubai transformed from sand dunes to a thriving community with commercial and residential spaces and social attractions. Dubai's 255,484 sq.m of commercial ofce accommodation are spread across ten towers to develop a core population and create foot trafc. The area benets from its access to major retail centres (Dubai Mall, Souk Al Bahar), which raises the desirability of the area to residents. The area also benets from the iconic developments such as Burj Khalifa, Dubai Fountain and Dubai Mall, which anchor the whole boulevard. Infrastructure 181Downtown Dubai followed the key principles above and incorporated place-making and programming elements in the master plan to create lively spaces, such as Burj Park, with its unobstructed view of Burj Khalifa and the Dubai Fountain. This multipurpose venue, accessible directly from Mohammed Bin Rashid Boulevard, accommodates all types of setups and events with its 11,300 sq.m lawn. It is also within walking distance of the Dubai Mall, Burj Khalifa and Souk Al Bahar and is an ideal location for concerts, product launches, weddings, and community events. Burj Plaza is a vast open-plan terrace with views of Burj Khalifa and The Dubai Fountain. Its 3,430 sq.m are suitable for events such as exhibitions and product launches, for up to 1,500 people. It is also accessible directly from Mohammed Bin Rashid Boulevard and walking distance from the Dubai Mall and Souq Al Bahar. The Dubai Fountain Mohammed Bin Rashid Boulevard extends for 3.5 km through downtown Dubai with easy access to Burj Khalifa, the Dubai Mall, the Old Town and the area's residential and hotel properties. It is ideal for events such as the Emirates Classic Car Festival, the Parade - Downtown Dubai, and UAE National Day. Dubai Marina - Commercial area Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 1824.5.2. Target segments and methodology Using these principles, the team chose market segments for whom the RED precinct would be curated, especially nearby urban areas such as Vijayawada, Guntur and Mangalagiri to maximise footfalls. Based on focus group discussions and in-depth interviews, the team developed an understanding o f these populations and de ned multiple segments who could be attracted to Amaravati from Vijayawada and Guntur: 1.White-collar wor kers postgraduate students 3.Blue-c ollar w orkers The focus group discussions helped the team understand the participants' retail, entertainment and dinin g preferences, what they consider to be missin g in Vijayawada and Guntur, how often they go out, w ho they go wit h, how muc h they spen d, and so on. Participants ran ked 15 concepts across the retail entertainment and dining into three categories: 'Must Have', rationales. This provided the team with a clear understandin g of the tastes and pre ferences o f each target segment to help prioritise retai l, entertainment an d dining options, an d anticipate eac h segment's footfalls and spendin g. In-depth interviews across tar get se gments in Vijayawada and Guntur revealed key elements missing, such shopping options, with only three or four mid-sized malls and limited variety in shoppin g districts. They said few full-day activities were available, with no inte grated resorts or offerings for multiple age groups. Vijayawada has little or no open space, leading to congestion and pollution . No integrated sports or tness centres are available with multiple options at a single location, and few sports facilities are within walking distance from residential areas. Interviewees cited movies as a primary source o f entertainment.

First impressions of Amaravati Target consumers' views of Amaravati have implications for attracting them from nearby cities and driving growth in the capital region. Students, for example, see Amaravati as a great place to nd jobs in services and IT. Educational institutes across the Krishna and Guntur district will produce many talented people who will nd Amaravati appealin g. Many blue-collar wor kers are drawn to the idea that they could live in a world-class capital where they could enjoy excellent social amenities such as schools and open spaces. They have concerns that housing prices could rise, which the city can address through appropriate and curated residential o fferings . Businesspeople view the development as an opportunity for business and commerce, but will need strong connectivity by road, rail and air to open new esta blishments in the city.

Amaravati's retail, entertainment and dining (RED) precinct Rigorous analysis yielded six concepts to develop a vibrant and bright RED precinct which would attract citizens from across the capital region and satisfy all target segments: 1.Outlet mall Many people in the region consider shopping a major weekend activity, but while cities around Amaravati have malls, shoppers say they have limited options and few or no discounts or promotional events. Amaravati could therefore attract many visitors by offering an outlet mall with offerings across age groups and gender, including a variety of brands from across the country not available in Vijayawada, Guntur or Mangalagiri. Outlet mall with 30+ stores like Levis, Vero Moda, Jack and Jones, Samsonite at heavily disounted prices 2.Water sports and boating Among entertainment options, water sports appealed to the most people across target segments. They loved the idea of engaging with the water and access to such thrilling activities so close to home. The city can support boating and other water sports on the Krishna River, such as kayaking, zip-lining, zorbing and jet skiing, especially for younger age groups, while boating and relaxing will appeal to older age groups. These activities could be a great way to spend time with family and friends during special occasions. 3.Indoor and outdoor theme park Stakeholders say Vijayawada and Guntur have limited theme parks and few options for full- day activities. Amaravati could support a full-day indoor and outdoor theme park designed to meet the needs of wide range of people, especially families and large groups. The park could feature themed restaurants, cultural shows, interaction centres, a gaming complex, and indoor sports.188 Have a pleasant evening boating around in Krishna River Spend a relaxing evening, eating fresh food and enjoying the scenery on a house boat in the Krishna River Kayak in the serene surroundings of Krishna River when you need to take some time out from your busy scheduleSoak up the sun and let loose on the open waters Zip lining - Make like a modern day Tarzan, hanging from a harness and moving between hills at speeds of 80 kphExperience water in a complementary different way - The zorbing ball allows you to be one with the water Entertainment concepts - Outdoor activities Triumph over the rivals after a gruelin g match of paintballSpectacular go kartin g track for a thrilling experienc eLose yourself in an enchanted maz e garde n a189 InfrastructureEntertainment concepts - Indoor arcade (e. g., Smash in Bombay, SEGA Park in Dubai ) Experience the best virtual reality - indoor hand gliding, go-carting, cricket and other attractionsEnjoy bumper cars on the latest and fastest wheels World class bowling alley with accompaying video game arcade and bumping carsExperience life without gravity in the space simulator 4.Riverfront dining Interviewees in Vijayawada and Guntur universally agreed on the value o f water front development in Amaravati, including a row o f restaurants with a range o f cuisines, pubs, live dining experiences, etc. Riverfront dinin g with live music, multiple restaurants and bars with promotions an d regular excitin g event sSocio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 1905.

Open bars and restaurants Multiple cusines from across the world Well lit up with sprawling chairs and tables to accomodate all friends and family 4.2.6. Attracting people to the RED district To attract residents of nearby cities on a regular basis, the RED precinct will need to become a signicant social anchor and economically viable. This will require that multiple initiatives be launched simultaneously to enable easy access and build a vibrant precinct: Eight to ten high-end curated events, such as 15-day mela , music or food festivals, night festivals to bring pedestrians to the streets in the evening, a theatre week with open-air theatre, celebrity performances, or arts and crafts exhibitions. Strategic tie-ups with hotels and tour agencies in neighbouring cities that include the RED precinct in their itineraries. Shuttle services from hotels other pick-up points to make visiting convenient for tour operators and customers. Loyalty schemes and targeted promotions such as discounts on selected stores on return visits. The city can use big data to prole and develop acquisition plans for customers and maintain an ROI dashboard for acquisition efforts. A loss leader food or retail anchor to excite people to visit. Substantial discounts could create excitement and word of mouth. Promotional discounts for large shopping events, such as weddings. Games and events for kids. Half- and full-day events, such as treasure hunts, can keep them engaged and allow parents to spend more time in RED. Promotional discounts for kids can also appeal to families considering a visit.191 InfrastructureFigure76: A new and expanded RED o ffering will meet needs o f residents o f the capital region Retai l/g402Outlet mall with 30+ stores o f known brands at di scounted prices /g402Cultural street ret ail -handicra fts, local produce from around AP and other parts o f the countr y /g402An organised , well-managed and hygienic eat streetwith food outlets /g402Outlets f or specialisedAP cuisine and foodfrom different parts of the country /g402Riverfront dinin g facilitiesDining/g402Water par k /g402Indoor and outdoor gaming and cultural zone s /g402Multiplex/movie theater /g402AmphitheatreEntertainment /g402Central Park with min i-zoo /g402Boatin g and relaxation activities around the river /g402Health and wellness resor tOpen spaces, parks, etc . /g40218 hole golf course /g402Club house with gym, pool, indoor activities, dinin g /g402Communit y center and librar y /g402Indoor andoutdoor multipurpose hal ls for banquets, hall, centerOther elements SOURCE: APCRDA plannin g Figure77: RED will create a for footfalls, achieving ~8,000-10,000 footfalls annually by 2022 ...

Need for a funding strategy To create world-class livin g standards, Amaravati will require investments of about INR 44,000 crore for priority infrastructure pro jects over the next 10 years. To complete these pro jects on time and on bud get, the city will need a well-planned fundin g strate gy. An effective fundin identifyin g sources of funds, projectin g fundin g across phases of the project, and a structure to ensure efcienc y and control. 5.2. Sources of funds With thorou gh analysis, ei ght main sources of fundin g suited to Amaravati's unique greeneld character h ave been identied : 1.Support from central government , includin g targeting central government grants applicable to Amaravati such as AMRUT, IPDS, flood mana gement pro gramme, and Smart City mission 2.Loans from multilateral a gencie s such as the World Bank, NDB, and AIIB could play hel p nance key infrastructure projects such as waste water and solid waste mana gemen t 3.Housin g and Urban Development Corporation loans, collateralised at attractive rates , could be a ke y source of funds for APCRD A 4.Public/ private partnershi ps could reduce u pfront ca pital ex penses, and private- sector mana gement will mean more efcient construction and operation of lar ge infrastructure pro jects 5.Institutional inv estments from LIC, EPFO and other lar ge organisations will contribute lon g- term ca pital. The city may also a pproach the National Infrastructure Investment Fund and other groups to invest in infrastructure projects 6.Foreign investors such as the Canada Pension Fund can invest in yield- generatin g assets and earn si gnicant return s 7.Land monetisation , especially as land prices rise with development in the capital re gion 8.State Government grants could help fund the remainin g infrastructure requirements, includin g a share of VAT and surchar ges on stamp duties.Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 1945.3. Three phases of the funding strategy The funding strategy will evolve with the city in three major phases: the short term (1-3 years ), medium term (3-5 years ) and long-term (beyond 5 years ). A phased approach is required because each funding source has speci c risk tolerance levels and expectations o f returns. As the city develops and the bene ts of infrastructure investment accrue, the land bank value will appreciate, reducing the funding risk . Each phase will have distinct nancing features: 1.Phase 1 - Short term (1-3 years ) Primary sources o f funds in rst phase will be central and state government grants along with central government schemes like AMRUT, Smart Cities Mission, and NRCP. Other sources of funds can include loans from HUDC O and the World Bank and PPP for key infrastructure projects .Figure 78: There are 8 major sources o f funding that APCRDAcanleverag e SOURCE: APCRD Aplannin gLand monetisation Multilateral and bilateral partnershi p Domestic debt marke t HUDCO Internationa l debt mar ket Equity Central Govt. scheme s Support from GOAPNew Develo pment Bank; Asian Ban LIC, ESIC HUDC O CPPInvestment Board NIIF Ministry Urban Development Government of Andhra Prades hInvest or classes1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9Capitalizing on Capita l city developmen t Power, water etc. 195First three years of the project are crucial to send the ri ght signals to the market and prepare the ground for funding the subsequent stages. Trunk infrastructure must be completed quickly, for example, using funds allocated by GoI and GoAP . 2.Phase 2 - Medium term (3-5 years) Owing to rapid development, land monetisation will be the primary source of funds in this stage. The city will also seek capital from institutional investors such as LIC and EPFO to sustain growth, and approach NIIF to invest in key infrastructure projects . In the medium term, new trunk infrastructure will attract people to the city, signicantly increasing the value of land. 3.Phase 3 - Long term (5-10 years ) Land monetisation will become the most important source o f fund in this phase, when land prices will be highest. Development and a signi cant increase in the population will naturally attract more patient sources of capital with investment horizons of 10-15 years, such as soverei gn wealth and pension funds, and Masala bonds. Private equity investors could be keen to invest in speci c projects, such as waste water treatment and solid wast e management, in collaboration with developers, for horizons o f 5-7 years . Figure 79:Proposed phased funding approach Short term (1-3 years )Medium term (3-5 years )Long h will 1 Funding StrategySocio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 1965.4. Funding structure and framework To tap these multiple sources of funding, the city must establish a world-class funding structure with the most o ptimal investment nance vehicles. This structure should minimise tax burdens and accommodate different forms of capital, including debt and equity, from local and foreign investors. The city should inspire lenders' and investors' con dence by providing healthy returns. The following nancial entities form an integral part o f the funding framework: 1.APCRDA City Development Fund (CDF) APCRDA, the authority in charge o f developing Amaravati, will act as the primary nancier for the city. It will receive grants from the state and central government and raise debt from sources such as HUDC O and the World Bank. All funds will be deposited in the CDF in a corporate account under APCRDA which will be le gally rin g-fenced so that the funds can be utilised only for the development of Amaravati. 2.Project Trust Fund (PTF) The PTF will act as the primary investment nance vehicle for development. A programme management committee will disburse funds from the PTF for infrastructure projects on a case-by-case basis. The fund will be established as an AIF Category 2 Fund, guided by SEBI regulations .Figure 80: Develop a next generation world class funding structure to attract investments from a variet y of investor classe s One legal entity 1 Set up as an Alternate Investment Fund Cate gory Two Fund, Mutual Fund and Infrastructure Investment Trust 2 Asset Management Compan yEquityGoIand GoAPInternati Fund (PTF)1City Develo pment Fund (CDF)EquityHUDCO, World Bank Debt Ring fenced entity1/g402ADCdevelops detailed project proposals and submits to PTF /g402Investment comm ittee of PTFwill ratify and approve /g402CDF wi ll provi de equit y toPTF.

Since APCRDA is a government entity established throu gh an act, and responsible for a re gion of about 8000 square kilometres, its investment in the city throu gh equity participation will send a clear si gnal to the market that it is committed to the project and that the governments believes in its success and strate gic importance to the re gion. On the stren gth of the equity investment from APCRDA, the PTF can raise equity from other entities such as forei gn instituti onal invest ors and NIIF. Funding Strategy \"A well-planned funding strategy will be critical and will facilitate the success of the city.\"198Advantages of funding structure This structure offers multiple advantages: Tax efciency: The Project Trust fund is an AIF Category 2 Fund and hence allows for a 'tax pass-through', which allows foreign institutional investors to invest in Amaravati without being taxed in India, retaining any tax advantages they enjoy in their home country (Reference: Chapter XII-FB of the Income Tax Act) For example, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board enjoys tax-free status in Canada. The CPPIB may invest in the APCRDA Trust while retaining this advantage and ensuring that none of its other investments become liable to taxation. Appeal to a wide range of investors: The multiple tax advantages of the Trust Fund will attract foreign capital and a range of investor classes. Oversight by the SEBI will give investors condence. Flexibility: The structure can accommodate different forms of equity and debt to match the risk/return proles of projects and institutions. Ring-fencing: The creation of an APCRDA Urban Development Trust Fund will ensure that all funds secured will be used for the intended purposes of the Capital City only.199 Funding Strategy200 Socio-Economic Operations: How Amaravati run and maintained 2016. City operations: How Amaravati will be run and maintained High-quality operations will be required to translate the recommendations of the Socio- Economic Master Plan into action and realise the aspirations of the capital city. Operations include service delivery, policy facilitation, user-charge management, maintenance, and community engagement, among other functions . By setting up a responsive governance structure and adhering to best practices in operations, the city will ensure its long-term sel f-sufciency and maintain its world-class in frastructure. Managers and civic leaders will adhere to the following principles : 1.Cost recovery : The city is being designed to cover the long-term costs o f operations an d maintenance to avoid placing large nancial burdens on taxpayers . 2.Differential pricing: People and businesses will pay for social institutions and residential and commercial space based on their commercial returns and requirements . 3.Payments for municipal services: Reasonable tari ffs will be levied for non-critical municipal services, such as design approvals and property trans fers, to help the city be sel f-sufcient. 4.Recurring revenue-generat ing assets: Assets such as billboards, trans fer taxes, and kiosks will generate recurring revenue to cover some operating costs. 5.Consistent commun ity management : Each zone will have strong community management standards and regu lations, suc h as co lour sc hemes an d window-c leaning an d air conditioner placement requirements, to provide a distinctive and consistent look and feel in each neigh bourhood. 6.Respons iveness to c itizens ' needs: People will be able to get in formation and make requests 24x7 through modes such as a city app, online helpdes k or central helpline. 7.Infrastructure maintenance costs : To maintain facilities at world-class levels, a fund o f 1-2% of capital costs may be taken aside for re furbishment. In addition to these principles, the institutional structure, which includes government entities and their responsibilities, will be critical to the city's success. The Government there fore de ned the 'capital city area' in the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority Act o f 2014, and set up the APCRDA. As per the act, all the line departments o f Government within the capita l city area suc h as revenue, po lice, e lectricity, transport, housing, in dustries, e ducation, re, medical and health, wel fare, civil supplies, environment, roads and buildings, registration and stamps, excise, tourism and culture, shall report to the Commissioner o f APCRDA. Socio-Economic Master Plan for Amaravati 202The Authority is tasked with plannin g, development, re gulation and other functions within the capital city area. The existin g Gram Panchayats, Municipalities and Municipal Corporations within the capital re gion remain functional within their respective jurisdictions based on the prevailin g rules and respective laws . The Government has also established (In G.O.Ms. No.109, MA&UD (M2) De pt., February 5, 2015) a Capital City Development and Mana gement Corporation (CCDMC) - a special-purpose vehicle (SPV) under panies Act, 2013, for plementation, and mana gement the APCRDA shall be the re gulatory and plannin g authority for the entire capital re gion and the development a gency outside the 217 square kilometres of the capital city, CCDMC shall be the development a gency for capital city area and shall take up trunk infrastructure works includin g the inner rin g road, city access road, major roads, water treatment plant, water supply, sewera ge treatment plant, sewera ge, power, government buildin gs, waterways, and greenery within the Capital City. The CCDMC will work under the guidance of Economic Development Board and will take up projects in the capital city throu gh project-specic SPVs. It will also take up projects wherever possible throu gh public/private partnerships (PPPs) such as Annuity, Build-Operate-Transfer, and Build-Own-Operate-Transfer. Decisions about land ownership, mort gages, and auctions with re gard to CCDMC and CRDA will be made in consultation with le gal and tax experts. \"A well-planned funding strategy will be critical and will facilitate the success of the city.\"City Operations: How Amaravati will be run and maintained 203APCRDA and CCDMC (ADC ) will work closely with each other in the interest of the capital city development.

Inclusive growth Around the world, urbanisation - the movement of people from the rural a griculture-based environments to urban settin gs engaged in non-a gricultural pursuits - is one of the most powerful levers in acceleratin g economic growth and improvin g livin g standards. India is no exce ption:t per ca pita income in urban areas is nearly three times that in rural areas, and this trend is likel y to continue at least for the next 10-15 years. Accordin g to research by the consultin g rm McKinsey & Co., cities could produce more than 70% of incremental GDP for India over the next 10-15 years, with cities of more than a million people accountin g for over a quarter of this growth. In addition to drivin g growth, the economies of scale provided by cities can si gnicantly lower the cost of deliverin g services such as water and sanitation. Research indicates that the cost of deliverin g basic services is 30% to 50% chea per in cities than in s parsely populated areas . Amaravati, the People's Capital of AP, will be an unparalleled greeneld city founded on the principles of inclusive growth throu gh improved access to jobs, markets, healthcare, education and urban infrastructure. As a ca pital of ha ppiness and wellness with best-in-class liveability, Amaravati will be built accordin g to a well laid out socio-economic master plan. The city will aim to maximise growth while giving all residents, across the socio-economic spectrum, a hi gh quality of life. Amaravati will promote economic well-bein g by generatin g both blue- and white-collar employment. Ridin g on core stren gths in sectors such as education and healthcare, food processin g, electronics manufacturin g, textile, complemented by requisite infrastructure investments, Amaravati could generate 9-11 lakh jobs and a GDP of INR 60,000 to 85,000 crore by year 2020. This could result in a ra pid population increase from under 100,000 today as people settle in the city for business or employment alon g with their families. Many cities aspire to pro gress in an inclusive manner, brin ging benets and quality liveability to all strata of societ y, but this is an area where Indian cities falter badl y. About 35% of the urban population in India qualify as poor,278 for exam ple, and water availability in a ty pical Indian city is 105 litres per person per day , far less than the global benchmark of 150 - and water tends to be available for few hours durin g the day. Even the richest Indian cities such as Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata fare poorly when it comes to providin g all residents with basic services for a di gnied livin g. For example, more than half of Mumbai's people live in slums, more than half of which do not have toilets and are seriously lackin g clean water, sanitation, and healthcare.279 278Socio-Economic and Caste , 2011 (SECC to emer ge as /g82/g81/g72/g3/g82/g73/g3/g87/g75/g72/g3/g87/g82/g83/g87/g75/g85/g72/g72/g3/g75/g68/g83/g83 /g92/g70/g76/g87/g76/g72/g86/g3/g74/g79/g82/g69/g68/g79/g79 needs t o implement effective people-empowerment pro grammes and provide best-in-class urban servicesto all of its residents, irres pective elements willinclude: Hard infrastructur e: Developin g Amaravati strictly in adherence to the master plan will ensure that infrastructure develo ps before and as people move in and settle in the city. This will eliminate sub-par delivery and shorta ges of essential services such as water, sanitation, and trans portation . Quality social infrastructure for all: Schools, healthcare, and housin g need to be planne d carefully, run well, and monitored and evaluated re gularly and ri gorously to maintain high quality: -Education: The government will play a major role to promote and invest in education services as Amaravati's population grows. In addition to settin g up new schools in lin e with demand, the city will audit existin g schools, determine up grade requirements and develo p selected model schools with facilities at par with private schools. -Healthcar e: With three primary healthcare centres and about 15 sub-centres, Amaravati's infrastructure toda y is less than 80% of what Indian Public Health Standards recommend for a population of around 100,000 people. To close this gap and meet the needs of a growin g population, Amaravati will invest in primary and secondary healthcare services to become self-sufcient. Cross-state evidence indicates that public/ private partnershi ps and corporate social responsibility can play pivotal roles in improvin g supply and quality. In addition to developin g new healthcare facilities detailed in section 4.3.11 of the report, the city will establish performance monitorin g systems to maintain quality in a cost - effective m anner. -Housing: To achieve Amaravati's objective of bein g a slum-free city, the government is committed to makin g at last 5% of housin g affordable, as per the APCRDA Act . Skill develo pment su pport: APCRDA will set up industrial trainin g institutes to help workers build their skills and nd jobs in focus sectors, enlar ging the talent pool for companies settin g up in the capital. Land amal gamation and builder-tie ups : To provide farmers with the maximum benet from their land, the Government will facilitate land amal gamation and builder-tie ups. These measures will allow farmers to pool their plots to make the land more valuable to builders. Inclusive Growth 207In addition to the bene ts for farmers, these measures will also help the city develop in an integrated and planned manner across larger plots rather than in a fragmented fashion. The government will only play a facilitation role and ensure that farmer rights are secured. These measures are strictly voluntary and an additional support for farmers who wish to bene t from this service . Through these measures, Amaravati will make progress toward its core mission o f prosperity, happiness and health for all strata o f society .
