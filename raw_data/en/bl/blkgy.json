Getting vaccinated is one of the best ways to maintain good health and protect you and those you care about against infectious diseases. Vaccinations offer protection against serious diseases by stimulating the immune system to create antibodies against certain bacteria or viruses. [Get vaccination guidance from Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/in-depth/vaccine-guidance/art-20536857?_ga=2.79340244.1367196556.1668509762-1839375987.1667830647) \u2014 including benefits, safety, side effects and what to know about recommended vaccines \u2014 for babies, children, teens, adults and during pregnancy. For recommended vaccines based on age, refer to the [adult](/prevention-and-wellness/adult) or [child and adolescent](/prevention-and-wellness/child) schedules. Contact [your primary care practice site](https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/locations) to make an appointment. The appointment coordinator can help you decide if you need to schedule a provider or nurse visit. Review the [history of infectious disease outbreaks and vaccines timeline](https://www.mayoclinic.org/coronavirus-covid-19/history-disease-outbreaks-vaccine-timeline) for information about major disease outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics and the impacts of vaccines and research. Mayo Clinic Recommended Vaccines for Children Mayo Clinic recommends specific vaccines to help provide protection for school-age children and those in child care and school. These recommendations support state child care and school requirements for vaccines to be up to date. Mayo Clinic does not base its recommendations on state requirements. Mayo Clinic bases the recommendations on what your child needs, what is effective, and what is safe. If you need help knowing if your child is up to date, contact your primary care clinician for assistance. Upon turning 9 years old, your child should start the two-dose HPV vaccine series. When entering seventh grade, your child is due for two vaccines. These are the Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis) and MenACWY (meningococcal conjugate) vaccines. When your child turns 16 years of age, a second MenACWY vaccine is due. Your child will also need the yearly influenza vaccine and stay up to date on COVID-19 vaccine due. Influenza (flu) Mayo Clinic recommends everyone get a flu vaccine each year. Getting the flu vaccine is more important than ever this year. The symptoms of influenza and COVID-19 are so similar that having symptoms may require testing for COVID-19 or other respiratory illnesses. Also, at least for children, it appears getting symptoms from both increases the risk for hospitalization. - Patients must wait until they are six months old to get their first dose of flu vaccine. Children less than nine years of age will need two doses in the first season for protection from flu (these doses need to be 28 days apart). - For those six months through 64 years of age, we recommend the standard age-appropriate flu vaccine and not the high-dose reserved for those 65 years and older. - For those two years to 49 years who qualify, the nasal spray vaccine is an option. - Mayo Clinic considers those who qualify for either the injectable or the nasal spray vaccine both as equivalent options and does not recommend one over the other. The manufacturer has made major improvements and strong evidence supports this recommendation. - For those 65 years and older, Mayo Clinic recommends the high-dose flu vaccine. - Patients who have egg allergies, including those with allergies that cause more than hives, no longer need a special vaccine or a referral to an allergy specialist. Also, they won't need to be observed for 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine. Studies show that patients with egg allergies have no increase in allergic reactions to the flu vaccine than non-allergic patients. Any allergic reaction to the flu vaccine is very rare. Tetanus Boosters Tetanus/diphtheria vaccine (Td) or tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis (Tdap) are booster vaccines. All adolescents should receive the Tdap booster at 11 to 12 years of age. Those who have never received a Tdap in the past should get one dose now (this is regardless of prior Td dosing). Td or Tdap should be used to boost every 10 years but may be given sooner with an injury (your clinician will determine this need). Pregnant women should also get a dose of Tdap with each pregnancy. RSV Prevention Palivizumab (Synagis) is usually given seasonally from November through March to aid in the prevention of RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) in infants at high risk for hospitalization from RSV. The pandemic has impacted the RSV season. This year (2022) we started the five-dose series in September rather than November. Only a limited number of infants qualify. Your provider will contact you if your child qualifies for RSV prevention. "}
