Meaning the things we put on our skin eventually end up in our bloodstream! Cleaning up your home + beauty products can be intimidating or may even seem like an extremely annoying + time consuming thing to do at first. If you're feeling this way, you're not alone! It's actually exactly how I felt just a few years ago. When I learned about the MANY unnecessary toxins in our everyday home + beauty products it kind of blew my mind. From hormone disruptors, to neurotoxins, to all sorts of weird shit... the US does a pretty terrible job regulating the ingredients in beauty + home products. So yet again- we have to be our own advocates! It took me a few years of consistent, gradual change to make the swap to a non-toxic lifestyle.
