I recall back in the 3rd year of medical school at the [Hahnemann College for Heilkunst](http://www.homeopathy.com/college/) this discussion being raised in class. We talked about how diseases of a microbiological nature are naturally declining. How many of your peers or family members have suffering recently from cholera or scarlet fever? Even cancer is on a 25% lessening trajectory and with less than 3% therapeutic efficacy in conventional medicine, this certainly is not due to surgery, chemotherapy or radiation. Autism will become the scourge of our modern times. It is a condition of a lack of a healthy [ontic](https://arcanum.ca/2012/02/18/a-closer-look-at-the-ontic-organization-real-cancer-prevention/) (ontological, individuality or sense of one's self) and on the biological level, physical and emotional armouring. There is a reason that autism is coming up on the tail end of cancer, a disease so prevalent in the 60s and 70s. That is because many of these babes are being born to professional mothers who've been subjected not only to a whole host of environmental toxicity, vaccines, [mercury](https://arcanum.ca/2010/01/31/mercury-autism-and-the-global-vaccine-agenda/) fillings, and expectations to be as intellectually adept by matching their male counterparts a full 50% in global boardrooms. However, this all is coming at a cost. Our autistic children are being born to mothers bourn out of of the state of mind of [cancer](https://arcanum.ca/2012/05/03/an-introduction-to-the-cancer-miasm/). They're mostly armoured in their natural functioning and unfoldment, they rescue others to the exclusion of themselves, and suffer feelings of the un-lived life. This is the definition for the state of mind of cancer and they are prey to the education system and the corporate infrastructure, needing a false authority to tell them what to do. I know, because they attempt to put me on the same pedestal. No, I'm not saying that stay at home moms are preferable to working moms for raising our babies. The intellect will attempt to categorize what I'm saying here with a big wad of guilt and a knee jerk reflective desire to distill the whole phenomenon down to the simplest terms. It doesn't work like that. We can't fix this phenomenon without the proper rumination or consideration. It's precisely THIS way of intellectualizing that is part of the problem. The intellect despises phenomenology as it prefers uni-dimensional thinking. What I am saying is that we're transitioning more and more into intellectual automatons, which is leaving our wombs and bubba-kins bereft of feeling, love, grace, ease, naturalness, surrender, and the capacity for true wisdom properly ensouled and incarnated in our physical bodies. We've lost much of our inherent ataraxia and it is impacting on the health of our children. Our babes are being ravaged as a side-line project, an intellectual side-bar, because most people seem to \"think\" that they should spawn at least one child. It is part of the social construct, an offshoot of our armoured beliefs, it is something we just do. Isn't it?! We've lost much of the modus operandi to want to wholly realize a love so profound with our partner, that we're overflowing with generosity and feeling by extending this to another human being for the whole of their childhood and beyond. We're having children and then resenting parenting them so we give them to others to parent and educate them for us. I once served a female lawyer who clearly never loved her husband in that luscious, full throttle kind of orgastic way, and had really used him as a donor to spawn a son and daughter. Her hate for him and her circumstances was palatable. Her focus was on fixing her children in a loveless marriage. She even slept with the kids and never him! Can you imagine?! It was sad and pathetic and frustrating for all involved, including me, as the practitioner. You can have the greatest regimen and throw remedies at a situation like that, but until the individual chooses love and resonance, that broken wheel is never going to turn out right, and neither are the kids. I've written another article on why love and intimacy are critical for the health and well-being of our children, regardless of whether they're in the spectrum or not [here](https://arcanum.ca/2015/11/23/looking-at-the-autism-spectrum-in-light-of-the-health-of-the-parents-relationship/). We're, sadly, seeing giving birth more as an intellectual milestone of achieving just one more more rung in the accomplishment factory of our driven natures through false expectations. Add to that state of mind, or lack thereof, our genetics, toxic loads in the way of GMO's, vaccines, DNA complications, circumcision, mental anguish, and intellectual robotics, and you have a dynamic recipe for creating a child suffering ASD issues; vaccinated or not! We've forgotten how to simply be, postured more as widgets to false authority and the expectations of others than on fulfilling our own true desire programs through love and a full embodied sense of our individual selves, which can at times include love for another human being, but not necessarily. I know plenty of women, and men too, who ignore their artistic or musical abilities for a law or medical degree instead, but try a side order of parenthood with disastrous consequences. We diminish the wisdom in the arts (or other more personal fulfillments) and herald the capacity to sort intellectually in the most mechanistic and materialistic of ways. Years ago, I served a writer mom of two autistic boys (a rare case of non-vaxxed children) who made herself go to university for pharmacy, working dispensing pills while wearing her Birkenstocks. She was a full-fledged granola momma, working a socially expected paradigm that was totally incongruent with her values. She wasn't even close enough to the cash register to guide patients to the more resonant homeopathic medicines that she loved and used at home; her true personal preference, as she hated Big Pharma and pill pushing doctors. She lived from a state of utter incongruence and she had the symptoms to prove it. She wrote poetry on her off-hours while totally exhausted from 12 hour shifts. She despised her life and believed that she must settle for her present existence in order to clothe and feed her sons. Her husband was an artist too. By systematically procreating, without an ensouled thought for the outcome of this choice, we starve our babes of a becoming functionally whole. This is why, as a function of evolution, we're seeing less diseases of the physical body, like cholera, and more conditions related to our armoured beliefs, minds, spirit devoid of a true embodied wisdom. Spiritual diseases like autism, schizophrenia and drug abuse (recreational and pharmaceuticals) are on the rise. The trajectory indicates that ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorders) will become epidemic. At the time of this writing 1 in 45 children will be diagnosed as autistic. I know this phenomenon to be true; I suffered this dynamic myself and I wrote a book, entitled, \" [The Path To Cure; The Whole Art of Healing Autism](http://www.thepathtocure.com/bonus)\", for the same reasons I've cited above. In the book, I cite my own son's exodus from the autism spectrum due to Heilkunst treatment, but not to the exclusion of my former gestures of feeling prey to the expectations of others. I was a broken, bereft automaton, educated by a traditional university and working in public enterprise that did not give a rat's hiney whether I ever had an individual thought in my head or not. I was a Financial Advisor working for government with a dental plan and a pension, an armoured cog in a very big unfeeling wheel. I was a widget, a contrivance of cloned cyborgs, working in 8 x 12 blue felt cubicles next to other cyborgs. I hated it and my armoured hate produced a replicate of my intellectual stimming, a babe, who mimicked my chronic fears and anxieties, devoid of speech with chronic rocking back and forth, with little eye contact. Are you starting to feel the connection? Jordan had no way of being cured until I addressed the lack of connection to my true essential self ... the false ego had to go! Michael J. Lincoln, in his book \" [Messages From The Body](http://amzn.to/1QsJ9O9),\" illustrates Autism as: \"Who's the parent here?\" There is childish behaviour by the adults going on around them, resulting in the individual's feeling unprotected and vulnerable to invasive influences. In particular, the child is likely to be responding to their mother's situation, feelings, and disrupted functioning. There is an experience of being helpless to cope with their situation, and it indicates that their emotional needs are not being met. They feel like they and their needs are being relegated to the back burner, and that they are being pushed aside by their family (mother in particular). It undermines their immune system and their ability to take care of themselves. It arises when the adults are more concerned about their own immediate comforts and convenience than they are about the welfare of the child, or when they operate with beliefs that teach the child that the child or they don't have what it takes for the child to be perfectly safe and healthy. \"Out there.\" They are an autistic or schizophrenic who is incapable of dealing with the demands of life. They live in constant fearfulness and overwhelm experiences. It is a \"re-evaluation\" of their life purpose, in which the essence processes the last several lives while not being in a position where they have to take care of themselves or anything else. Whatever family and/or genetic processes were involved in the precipitation of the disorder were part of the destiny design. \"Feeling-phobia.\" They were so devastatingly but super-subtly trained to avoid awareness of the emotions as a child that it has resulted in a breakdown of the physical system for doing so. They come from a severely denial-dominated and or repressive dysfunctional family in which any contact with what people were really feeling would have resulted in a calamitous collapse of the whole family. Here's a video based on Wilhelm Reich's book, \" [Children Of The Future](http://amzn.to/1Q7eGEZ)\", that may explain the gist of this article an how we produce, and alternatively prevent, armouring and gestures of autism more clearly: In summation, the microbiological diseases were designed to furnish the physical and etheric bodies with enough challenges to help along their incarnate capacities for this next phase of evolution. We're at the precipice of fully integrating the self, our ontic organization (as per Rudolf Steiner), or individuality. Think iPhone, iPad, iMovie, etc. Perhaps you'll also find it interesting that autistic children generally demand an iEducation based on individual mentorship rather than conforming to the expectation of a one size fits all educational approach most of us were subjected to. We used to all, more or less, do the same thing in the post industrial age, working in offices, wearing the same suits. Now we're striving for autonomy and sovereignty. The challenge, now, becomes ontological and the condition most associated with this task is autism. It is said that we're all in the spectrum to a degree. The [genetic miasms](https://arcanum.ca/2012/08/16/heilkunst-basics-grade-eleven-the-chronic-miasms/) most associated with autism are [Syphilis](https://arcanum.ca/2012/06/24/syphilis-has-arrived-on-the-coat-tails-of-summer/) and [Lyme](https://arcanum.ca/2012/08/07/an-introduction-to-the-lyme-miasm/) which, as mentioned prior, follows on the heels of Cancer as per timeline treatment under the Heilkunst umbrella of protocol. [If you're looking for additional resources, regarding this whole phenomenon, I wrote a second book on this topic entitled, \"](https://arcanum.ca/unfolding) [Unfolding The Essential Self; From Rage to Orgastic Potency](https://arcanum.ca/unfolding).\" It is my postgraduate thesis and also a culmination of my own personal functional purpose. I've spent the latter 20 years working to unravel the mess that society, my diseases, armouring, and my unwitting familial construct hemmed me into. Perhaps you are ready to take the blue pill and step out of [The Matrix](http://amzn.to/1pogO4J) too. Trinity: Neo... nobody has ever done this before. Neo: I know. That's why it's going to work.
