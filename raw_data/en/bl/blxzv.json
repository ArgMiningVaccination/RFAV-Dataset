Neto College Mario Schenberg (CEATA), Brazil Posters & Accepted Abstracts : [Allied J Med Res](https://www.alliedacademies.org/allied-journal-of-medical-research/) Abstract: Objective: To present the trace element chromium, the quantum frequency Desobesim and the quantum frequency Krebs as indication in patients with depression Methods: an interrogation was used according to the precepts of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), in which two patients responded orally to a questionnaire of 32 questions filled by the health professional. This interrogation covers constitutional and environmental aspects (addictions, habits and customs acquired). The myriad of Traditional Chinese Medicine water towards psychosomatic medicine, since they are areas seeking the origin of the cause of diseases. For this, the issues have been formulated objectively and contextually according to the current history and former of each individual to thus avoid evaluation errors that certainly incurred in the failure of the treatment. Every four questions formulated specifically corresponded to an organ (Zang) and/or V\u00edscera (FU). The organs or viscera that added more amount of YES in the interrogation was regarded as the organ or v\u00edscera with greater imbalance. It is not uncommon for the diagnosis of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) not to point out energetic imbalance in the meridian of the liver and pericardium, even if the patient was clinically diagnosed with depression. In this way, the prescription of trace element chromium and the Desobesim and Krebs Modulators, are added to other floral frequencies and modulars corresponding to the organs diagnosed by the Tradicional Chinese Medicine diagnostic method. Result: has been observed that patients with depression produce neurotoxins triggering various degenerative frames. After 120 days of use of the inductors and modular floral frequencies incurred in the natural detoxification of the organism when restoring the healthy frequency of brainwaves Conclusion: Evident conclusion that much additional study will be needed before a clear understanding between Traditional Chinese Medicine and Quantum Medicine. This treatment can stimulate future investigations in this highly significant area for exploratory study in depression. The limits of the study, because it is a sample composed of two patients, the data cannot be widespread for the "}
