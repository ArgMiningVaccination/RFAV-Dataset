OSTROWSKY PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER RWJBARNABAS HEALTH The development of COVID-19 vaccines is one of the greatest achievements in medical science. At RWJBarnabas Health, we're proud to be a key part of the effort to get the vaccine into the arms of all eligible people in New Jersey. We also remain committed to fighting the spread of the disease. That's why we join with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in urging everyone, whether vaccinated or not, to continue with the simple precautions we know are effective in preventing the spread of the coronavirus: Wear a mask. Stay at least six feet apart from people who don't live with you and avoid crowds. Wash your hands thoroughly and often; use a hand sanitizer if soap and water aren't available. The reason for this continued caution: In some cases, COVID-19 vaccines may protect against severe infection, but may not necessarily prevent mild or asymptomatic infection. If this is the case, an infected person could still spread the virus. The COVID-19 pandemic has unfortunately ravaged our community over the last year. However, our future is becoming brighter every day with the arrival of the vaccine. At Clara Maass Medical Center, in accordance with New Jersey's phased approach to vaccine distribution, we have administered the COVID-19 vaccination to thousands of individuals in our community. In March, we expanded access to the COVID-19 vaccine for the community in our Emergency Department for patients who are receiving treatment, meet the criteria for eligibility and are having difficulty accessing the vaccine. It will take all of us working together as a community to minimize the ongoing effects of COVID-19. Together, we can protect friends, family and neighbors and end this pandemic.

The first CMMC employee who volunteered to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was Tanya Howard, a Registered Nurse in the Intensive Care Unit. \"I made the decision to be among the first to receive the COVID-19 vaccine to protect myself and my family, and to help bring an end to the awful pandemic that has affected the entire country,\" Tanya says. \"As a nurse who has worked along the front lines over the last 10 months caring for patients that I knew would never recover from COVID-19, I know the vaccine represents a promising moment in time for our community and the entire world.\" @ClaraMaassMedicalCenter @Clara_Maass RWJBarnabas Health Clara Maass Medical Center clara_maass.medicalcenterTanya Howard, RN, received the first COVID-19 vaccine at CMMC from Susan Hagen Morrison, MD, allergist, immunologist and infectious disease specialist.

In addition, we've applied for more vaccination sites for physician offices.\" As of mid-March, RWJBH had already vaccinated approximately 150,500 people and was vaccinating more at the rate of 2,000 a day at its hospitals and 4,000 a day at the Edison megasite. However, Dr. Bonamo says that number will increase significantly as vaccine availability does. \"We're ramping up,\" he says. \"We're in this to get it done.\" By summer, Dr. Bonamo says, vaccine supplies will make it available to all who want it. The challenge will shift to making sure everyone who's eligible chooses to be vaccinated. DISPELLING FEARS \"Many people started out with 'vaccine hesitancy'\u2014they wanted to see how other people did with the vaccine first,\" says Dr. Bonamo. \"As they saw others feeling good about having had the vaccine, they became more open to it.\" That led to the clamor for vaccination appointments the state saw in the winter. Vaccine hesitancy persists, however. \"There's understandable mistrust, especially in the black community, born of all the social inequity and healthcare injustice that has happened over the years,\" he says. \"We're working hard to dispel that with all kinds of outreach and town halls being done by healthcare professionals of color.\" Older adults should prioritize getting the vaccine, Dr. Bonamo says. \"The years they have are precious, and many seniors who got COVID-19 did not do well,\" he says. \"Often, that's because they have at least one other comorbidity\u2014diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, kidney disease, lung disease or obesity\u2014that contributes to their risk.\" Dr. Bonamo emphasizes that his message isn't just for certain groups, but for everybody who's eligible for the vaccine. \"Get vaccinated,\" he says. \"That's it. It's safe, it's smart, it's advanced science and it's the right thing to do to protect yourself and your family.\" JOHN BONAMO, MD AS AVAILABILITY INCREASES, EXPERTS HAVE ONE STRONG MESSAGE FOR THE PUBLIC: GET THE SHOT.VACCINATING NEW JERSEY Healthy Together | PB | Spring 2021 RWJBarnabas Health | RWJBH.ORG | 3 System_CovidVaccine_Spr21_Final.indd 3 3/17/21 11:35 AMA HIP REPLACEMENT ALLOWS AN ISELIN MAN TO GET BACK TO THE ACTIVITIES HE LOVES.BACK INHip replacement patient Curtis Melton is now in good form for sports that had previously become too painful. ACTION Healthy Together | 4 | Spring 2021 Clara Maass Medical Center | RWJBH.ORG/CLARAMAASS | 5 Healthy Together | 4 | Spring 2021 CMMC_OrthoPatient_Spr21_Final.indd 4 3/15/21 3:07 PMWhenever Curtis Melton, 58, a pharmaceutical representative from Iselin, sees someone struggling with hip pain, he remembers how he used to live with the same pain. \"I want to tell them that they could get their lives back if they had hip replacement like I did,\" he says. Curtis was an avid tennis player, golfer and runner who once averaged 20 miles a week. Eventually, his hip pain and stiffness became so bad that he couldn't take even a short walk in comfort. In early 2020, Curtis made an appointment with reconstructive orthopedic surgeon Frank Femino, MD, Medical Director of the Joint and Spine Institute at Clara Maass Medical Center (CMMC). \"Curtis was really suffering. You could see the pain in his face,\" Dr. Femino remembers. An X-ray confirmed that Curtis's left hip was severely arthritic. The cartilage was so worn down that the bony surfaces of the joint had become rough and were rubbing together, a condition known as \"bone on bone.\" In cases this severe, hip replacement is often recommended. However, Dr. Femino advocates first trying conservative management to alleviate symptoms before scheduling surgery. This may include weight loss, physical therapy or more holistic treatments such as acupuncture and yoga. \"I give the patient the choice to make the call,\" says Dr. Femino. Curtis discussed all his options with Dr. Femino. \"He took the time to answer all my questions,\" Curtis says. \"He even agreed to have a special conference with my wife and daughter to discuss their apprehensions. He told me that as an athlete, I was a prime candidate for hip replacement.\" \"Curtis already had good muscle tone and physically he was strong,\" says Dr Femino. \"The hip was his only limiting factor.\" Curtis's surgery was scheduled for March 2020, but elective surgeries such as his were postponed for a time because of the COVID-19 pandemic. GETTING READY In the meantime, presurgery classes at CMMC proved vital for Curtis as Dawn Bibbo, MSN, RN, ONC, Manager, Orthopedic and Bariatric Services at CMMC, helped him prepare. \"She filled me in on everything to expect,\" Curtis says. \"She told me what exercises to do and what to wear for physical therapy and recovery, and about the kind of spinal anesthesia I'd have that would allow me to wake up clearheaded, pain- free and ready for rehab.\" Hip replacement surgery, designed to improve function and ease pain, involves removal of the damaged hip joint and replacement with an artificial implant. \"The hip implants I use come in different sizes and shapes, and the device is personalized for each patient,\" Dr. Femino explains. The method he employs is minimally invasive, meaning that the incision is small and therefore heals faster. \"I use a lateral approach, which is from the side, toward the front, with the patient lying on his back. This allows me to measure leg length and check stability,\" Dr. Femino says. \"This lateral approach is one of the most stable, with a small chance of hip dislocation.\" To help speed recovery, Dr. Femino does not use heavy opioids for pain management. \"We use spinal anesthesia and also a local anesthetic around the hip, instead of general anesthesia, so patients wake up feeling fine and ready to do physical therapy,\" he says. HOME THAT NIGHT Curtis's surgery was rescheduled for June. On the big day, he recalls, he was lying on the bed in his room, waiting to go down to surgery. A doctor came in and asked for his name, which hip he was having done and other questions to check Curtis's cognition. ''Everything's good,'' the doctor Curtis replied. \"Dr. Femino?\" said the visiting doctor. \"Well, I want you to know he did both of my hips!\" \"I thought, wow,\" Curtis says. \"Now I felt as if every box had been checked. I was ready.\" Curtis's operation was at 8 a.m. \"I woke up afterwards, and it was like Christmas Day. I was mentally prepared for everything that would happen. \"The rehab people were great and quickly got me out of bed. I was on a walker by 3 o'clock, and went home at 6:30 that night. The visiting nurse began coming to my house the next morning.\" \"Curtis's positive attitude helped his rapid recovery,\" Dr. Femino says. \"At two weeks post-op he walked in without a cane, leapt right up on the table and said 'I feel great!'\" Three weeks after surgery, Curtis started hitting golf balls; five weeks later, he played a round of golf. And four months after surgery, he was playing full doubles tennis again. \"The surgery has been a real mood booster,\" Curtis says. \"I'm not in pain anymore.\" Thanks to advances in technology and techniques, hip replacement is increasingly appropriate for a wide range of people. \"I'm seeing a full spectrum of patients,\" says Dr. Femino. \"Many young ones who want to stay active, but also patients in their 90s, who are good candidates if they're in good health.\" Another benefit is that newer hip implants are long-lasting. \"I used to say that hip replacements can last 15 to 20 years,\" says Dr. Femino. \"But the ones I use now have extended wear lives. We can offer Curtis and our other patients the best chance possible for a device that will last a lifetime.\" To learn more about joint replacement surgery at the Joint and Spine Institute at Clara Maass Medical Center, call 844.63.ORTHO or visit www.rwjbh.org/ortho.FRANK FEMINO, MD Healthy Together | 4 | Spring 2021 Clara Maass Medical Center | RWJBH.ORG/CLARAMAASS | 5 Healthy Together | 4 | Spring 2021 CMMC_OrthoPatient_Spr21_REV1.indd 5 3/17/21 3:07 PMAT THE EYE CENTER, REGULAR CHECKUPS CAN LEAD TO EXTRAORDINARY RESULTS.WHY EYE EXAMS ARE ESSENTIAL Healthy Together | 6 | Spring 2021 Clara Maass Medical Center | RWJBH.ORG/CLARAMAASS | 7 CMMC_EyeSurgery_Spr21_Final.indd 6 3/15/21 3:10 PMThe Eye Center at Clara Maass Medical Center (CMMC) provides care for everyone from infants to senior citizens. That means offering a full spectrum of ophthalmic care, including the most sophisticated, cutting-edge techniques. However, it's not unusual for routine checkups and everyday interventions to make dramatic differences to patients, according to Michael Landolfi, DO, Medical Director of the Department of Ophthalmology at CMMC and Director of the Eye Center. \"I can't stress enough how important it is to have regular comprehensive eye examinations,\" he says. \"For example, we saw a young boy who was having serious problems in school and had grown so withdrawn that his parents were worried,\" he continues. \"They brought him into the center for an eye exam, but he was so overwhelmed by the equipment that it took two or three visits before he relaxed. I had to use an eye chart that was made up of images, rather than numbers. \"Once he was finally examined, it became clear that he'd been unable to see the blackboard but hadn't known how to verbalize this.\" The simple fact of being fitted with eyeglasses transformed the child's life, Dr. Landolfi says. WHAT EYES REVEAL Routine eye examinations can also detect serious health issues in the rest of the body, such as high blood pressure, lupus and even brain tumors, he explains. That was the case when one of Dr. Landolfi's longtime patients recently came to the center for a routine exam. \"As we were talking, I noticed that since the last time I'd seen her, there was a slight change in her lower eyelid\u2014a small growth,\" Dr. Landolfi recalls. \"While being careful not to needlessly frighten her, I recommended that she make an appointment with an ocular plastic surgeon to have it checked out. \"A few days later, she called to thank me. The surgeon had discovered that the spot was lowereyelid cancer and had already begun treating it. \"It was because she'd been seeing me for years and I know her well that I was able to detect the spot quickly. This is an excellent example of why regular eye care visits are essential,\" he says. One of the most common illnesses that can be discovered through an eye exam is diabetes. \"As part of a routine eye exam, we dilate the pupil and study the back of the eye,\" Dr. Landolfi explains. \"With diabetes, there is often bleeding and swelling evident in the retina. When this is discovered, I send patients to see their regular healthcare provider. Some patients are unaware that they have diabetes, while others are aware of their condition but don't realize that it's not fully under control.\" A RANGE OF CARE As essential as routine checkups are, they are just the beginning of the care provided at the Eye Center. The Eye Center provides prevention, diagnosis and treatments for all kinds of eye problems, diseases and injuries, such as dry eye, glaucoma, macular degeneration, diabetic eye disease and cataracts. All ophthalmologists and surgeons at the center are board-certified and can provide advanced treatment such as interocular lens implant; cataract, glaucoma and retina surgery; and 24-hour pediatric eye emergency trauma care. For older adults, advances in cataract surgery have been especially meaningful, Dr. Landolfi says. Cataracts, a clouding in the lens of the eye, are the result of a buildup in protein and are a normal part of aging. Traditionally, the goal of cataract surgery was to lower the prescription of eyeglasses; it wasn't possible to completely correct for distance, nearness or astigmatism. Now, however, with a single multifocal implant inserted during surgery, doctors can correct a patient's vision so substantially that there is often no need for eyeglasses. Dr. Landolfi has special memories of a particular cataract surgery. \"A grandmother who spoke only Spanish came in with her daughter the day after surgery to have her eyepatch removed. As soon as I took it off, she began weeping. I thought perhaps she was in pain and asked the daughter if she would translate what the grandmother was saying and why she was crying. \"The daughter saw her mother looking out at the waiting room, where the family was waiting. With tears in her own eyes she told me, 'It's because this is the first time she has seen her grandchildren.'\"EYE EXAMS: HOW OFTEN? According to the American Optometric Association, comprehensive eye examinations should take place on the following schedule\u2014more often if the patient is at risk for vision problems due to health-related conditions: Birth through age 2 At 6 to 12 months Ages 3 through 5 At least once between 3 and 5 years of age Ages 6 through 17 Before first grade and annually thereafter Ages 18 through 64 At least every two years Ages 65 and older Annually To learn more about eye surgery at Clara Maass Medical Center, call 973.450.2000 or visit www.rwjbh.og/claramaass . MICHAEL LANDOLFI, DO Healthy Together | 6 | Spring 2021 Clara Maass Medical Center | RWJBH.ORG/CLARAMAASS | PMAs residents of Montclair, Mei-Mei Tuan's family had firsthand experience with the kind of care Clara Maass Medical Center (CMMC) provides. Whether a family member was there for a kidney stone, a dislocated shoulder or any other medical need, they found that \"the focus is really on caring for patients, rather than getting them in and out the door as fast as possible,\" Mei-Mei says. \"Compare that with the treatment my grandmother received at a well- known hospital in New York City, where she was treated like a number instead of a person,\" she says. \"Some New York hospitals want you to feel like you're lucky to be there, whereas Clara Maass makes you feel like they're lucky to provide care for you.\" Mei-Mei's commitment to supporting her local community led her to join the Board of Trustees at both the Clara Maass Medical Center Foundationand the medical center itself, positions she retains today although her family has moved to New York City. (She and her family still travel to CMMC when they need medical care.) A cofounder and co-owner of Notch Partners LLC, which provides human capital services for institutional leveraged buyout funds, Mei-Mei is CEO of Phoenyx Partners, a specialized executive search firm focused on diversity in leadership. She is also a member of the Committee of 100, a prestigious leadership organization for Chinese Americans. Through Mei-Mei's efforts, the Committee of 100 donated much- needed personal protective equipment to CMMC during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mei-Mei says her goal is to use her board membership as a way to make a positive impact on people's lives. \"Trust in a local healthcare provider is paramount,\" she says. \"Only a local hospital can play that vital role as a trusted member of the community.\" BIG GOALS Mei-Mei was recruited to the board by fellow hospital and foundation trustee Brian Sterling, who along with his wife, Linda, made a significant donation toward upgraded Labor and Delivery suites at CMMC. \"He inspired me to make a donation to upgrade the facilities in the Emergency Department,\" she says. She was also influenced by Mary Ellen Clyne, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of CMMC. \"As a former nurse and one of the few female hospital CEOs, she is truly inspirational,\" Mei-Mei says. \"She's professional and also very personable, with zero pretensions.\" As a board member, Mei-Mei says, \"I want to help Clara Maass solidify its reputation as a world-class institution that also sets a shining example of how to provide quality care for patients. I'm proud to support Clara Maass because they are always investing, not in things that make them feel important, but things that directly provide better care to patients.\" That's a rewarding feeling, but not the only benefit of giving, she finds. \"When you support Clara Maass,\" she says, \"you really feel that you become a member of their family.\" To learn about giving to the Clara Maass Medical Center Foundation, visit www.claragiving.org.A TRUSTEE, DONOR AND GRATEFUL PATIENT FINDS THAT GIVING HAS ITS REWARDS.

To connect with one of NJ's top cardiovascular specialists, call 888.724.7123 or visit www.rwjbh.org/heart .Everyone experiences an increased heart rate at some point. You exercise, and your heart rate increases. You become frightened or stressed, and your heart beats faster. You might experience the increased heart rate as a skipped beat, a flutter or a pounding in your chest. \"A temporary increase in heart rate has many causes,\" says David Dobesh, MD, Chief of Cardiac Electrophysiology at Jersey City Medical Center and a member of RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group with offices in Jersey City and West Orange. \"Emotional stress, physical stress, psychological stress, even things like caffeine, nicotine, too much alcohol or fever. Your body is performing a complex balancing act with your pulse.\" A lesser-known but common source of increased heart rate is medication, including some kinds of over-the- counter medicines and certain prescriptions. \"People should be aware that some medicines dobriefly increase your heart rate,\" says Dr. Dobesh, \"and usually those episodes are not something you should be concerned about.\" POSSIBLE CAUSES Common medications that may increase heart rate for a short period of time include: Decongestants, specifically those that contain pseudoephedrine, a stimulant. \"If the decongestant has a capital 'D' at the end of its name, it contains this ingredient,\" says Dr. Dobesh. Some inhalers for asthma, emphysema or COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Theophylline, an oral asthma medication. Medications for ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). Diuretic medications (used to help prevent fluid retention) could result in dehydration, says Dr. Dobesh. Some blood pressure medications may inadvertently lower blood pressure too much. \"If your pressure is very low from either dehydration or overmedication, the body will respond by increasing the heart rate to compensate,\" he explains.\"Some medications carry warning labels about increased heart rate but in practice this side effect is unusual,\" Dr. Dobesh says. \"These include certain antidepressants and also thyroid medications, which will not usually increase heart rate if they're taken at the recommended dose.\" Similarly, herbal supplements such as ginseng, valerian root and orange bitters should not increase heart rate when taken in normal doses, he says. While a short-term increase in heart rate from medication or emotional or physical stress is normal, increased heart rate that lasts for a long time is not. \"If you're repeatedly feeling symptoms of a racing heartbeat that make you uncomfortable, tell your doctor,\" advises Dr. Dobesh. \"Further testing may be appropriate.\"WHAT IS TACHYCARDIA? For most people, a heart rate between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm) is normal. When your heart beats more than 100 bpm for reasons unrelated to physiological stress, that's known as tachycardia, from the Greek words for \"swift\" and \"heart.\" If increased heart rate is a concern, basic testing, such as an electrocardiogram or blood work, can be done to determine whether you should be referred to an electrophysiologist\u2014a cardiologist who specializes in heart rhythms. The electrophysiologist will look for possible types of tachycardia that are caused by an abnormality of the heart itself and can affect how well the heart pumps blood. Examples include atrial fibrillation (AFib), atrial flutter and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). A wide range of treatments may be considered, including lifestyle changes, medications and medical and surgical procedures.

Rutgers A RARE T-CELL LYMPHOMA Ling Jin needed treatment for a rare and aggressive form of T-cell lymphoma, requiring high-dose chemotherapy and radiation treatments in preparation for an allogeneic stem cell transplantation, sometimes referred to as a bone marrow transplant. As she underwent chemotherapy, a lymphoma was discovered behind her eye, which was resolved through brief and highly targeted proton beam therapy. After an extensive database search, an appropriate donor for bone marrow cells was found, and last June, Ling had a successful stem cell transplant at Rutgers Cancer Institute.BREAST CANCER WHILE PREGNANT Breast cancer survivor Liz Tague found out she was pregnant\u2014and soon after, learned that her breast cancer had recurred. After consulting with an oncologist in New York, Liz opted to have her treatment closer to home, guided by Rutgers Cancer Institute and RWJBarnabas Health. Following a lumpectomy and chemotherapy, Liz gave birth to a healthy son. Now it was time to consider radiation therapy to prevent further recurrence. Her doctors proposed proton beam therapy, which can be precisely targeted to spare previously irradiated tissues. Three years later, Liz is back to work as a teacher and enjoying family time with her toddler.STAGE 4 KIDNEY CANCER Jim Gritschke was fit and active, but weight loss and sharp pains in his right leg led him to an orthopedic surgeon.

This may be because people have been less active during this period, perhaps gaining weight or not controlling high blood pressure,\" he says. People who may have warning signs of an aneurysm often neglect them, assuming they'll simply go away, he says. In addition, many people have avoided seeking care because of fear of going to a hospital during the pandemic. \"The classic symptom is a severe headache\u2014one that feels like the worst headache of your life,\" Dr. Nanda explains. \"Not every headache is an aneurysm, of course, and most of the time it's not anything serious. But if you have this terrible headache along with neck stiffness, and bright light bothers you, you should go to the Emergency Department to have it investigated.\" ADVANCED TREATMENTS Aneurysms can be diagnosed by a CT (computed tomography) scan, which uses X-rays to determine whether blood has leaked into the brain. Doctors may also order an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), which uses computer- generated radio waves to create detailed images of the brain.

If surgery is indicated, we'll get our team together and perform it within 12 to 24 hours,\" says Dr. Nanda. \"For years, a procedure called clipping was the only way to fix an aneurysm,\" he explains. In this procedure, a craniotomy is performed to create an opening in the skull and then a small metal clip is placed on the aneurysm to stop the blood flow. \"Clipping is still the best solution for some cases,\" Dr. Nanda says. \"Today, however, the mainstay of treatment is coiling. We can thread the catheter through a groin artery to place a coil on the aneurysm, and there is no need to open the skull.\"TEAM OF EXPERTS Decisions about treatment are made on a case-by-case basis. \"We have a multidisciplinary team at RWJBarnabas Health and Rutgers,\" says Dr. Nanda. \"We have neurologists, neurosurgeons, a neuropsychologist, a neuroradiology team and endovascular specialists, all providing input about what will be most effective for the patient. We're like a special forces team, able to come together quickly. The patient gets 10 experts for a problem immediately, which is a huge advantage.\" Nurse practitioners, neurology nurses and neurophysiology technologists round out the care team. \"Another benefit of being part of a large system is that we have the advantage of research, clinical trials and education,\" Dr. Nanda says. \"We can do what we call translational research, meaning we take basic research that's being done on stroke and translate it into the clinical realm. It's a bench-to-bedside approach where we can really improve the condition of patients.\"WHAT IS A BRAIN ANEURYSM? A cerebral (brain) aneurysm is a weak spot on a brain artery that balloons or bulges out and fills with blood. If it bursts, it spills blood into the surrounding tissue, an event that's called a hemorrhage. Brain cells, deprived of oxygen, begin to die, and the patient may have a stroke.

We don't want to see our patients develop life-threatening issues like encephalitis from measles or meningitis from Haemophilus influenzae type B, which are prevented by safe, routine childhood vaccinations.\" \"Parents have been hesitant to bring their children to doctors' offices or clinics for fear of exposing them to COVID-19,\" explains Patricia Whitley- Williams, MD, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the Bristol-Myers Squibb Children's Hospital at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and Division Chief of Allergy, Immunology and Infectious Diseases at Rutgers- Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. \"However, these offices are following all the recommended guidelines fromthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\" Dr. Whitley-Williams says. \"Offices are sanitized in between patient appointments, plastic barriers are up, patients and visitors are checked for fever and masks are worn.\" (For children, wearing a mask is recommended over the age of two years.) \"Pediatricians' offices have protocols in place to keep well children and sick children apart,\" adds Dr. Hasan. \"Some set aside special time periods just for vaccinations. Many places require that people check in over the phone and wait outside in their cars. Patients and families then are brought straight into the office, so there's no exposure to other people in a waiting room.\" Parents who have safety concerns should contact their pediatrician's office to ensure that proper safety measures are in place, the doctors advise. FOLLOW THE SCHEDULE Timing is important when it comes to childhood vaccinations, Dr. Hasan says. \"Please don't put off having your child vaccinated because you think it's better to space the shots out,\" she says. \"The schedule of vaccines has been carefully determined to minimize risk and get the best response for each age.\" The recommended schedule for routine childhood vaccinations can be found at www.cdc.gov/vaccines. Expectant mothers should get the Tdap vaccine to protect the baby against pertussis, sometime between the 27th and 36th weeks of pregnancy, the CDC recommends. \"That vaccine has been a game changer for protecting vulnerable newborns,\" Dr. Hasan says. One vaccine many parents are eager to explore for their children is the one for COVID-19, Dr. Hasan says. \"I can't tell you how many calls we get about that,\" she says. \"We're eagerly awaiting the results of trials so we have safety data for the younger age groups, particularly for vulnerable populations such as those with kidney, heart or lung disease.\" In the meantime, routine childhood vaccinations should proceed as advised by your pediatrician. \"Parents and guardians should be assured that these vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective,\" says Dr. Whitley-Williams, \"and they save lives.\"To find a pediatrician at RWJBarnabas Health, call 888.724.7123 or visit www.rwjbh.org/doctors .UZMA HASAN, MD DON'T DELAY ROUTINE VACCINATIONS THAT WILL KEEP YOUR CHILD SAFE FROM PREVENTABLE DISEASES.WHY CHILDHOOD VACCINATIONS CAN'T WAIT PATRICIA WHITLEY-WILLIAMS, MD Healthy Spring 2021 System_PediatricVaccin_Spr21_final.indd 14 3/16/21 11:39 AMAt Children's Specialized Hospital, we provide world-class care for children and young adults who face special health challenges across the state of New Jersey and beyond.

A competitive athlete, Olivia had been training for the Age Group Triathlon World Championships in August 2015 when she crashed her bike while riding at 27 miles per hour. The impact of the crash left Olivia suffering from a broken nose, a torn gluteus maximus and several strains in her legs. Though her injuries healed with time, her pain continued and got progressively worse. Finally, Olivia was diagnosed with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), a form of chronic pain that develops after an injury but gets worse over time. While CRPS is not well understood, it's thought that high levels of nerve impulses are sent to the affected site. Olivia tried several outpatient therapies, but her pain persisted, leaving her unable to do most social or physical activities. Even walking to the car after a therapy session was an ordeal. After researching other avenues for treatment, Olivia learned about the four-week Inpatient Chronic Pain Management Program at CSH. \"I was searching for a way to get my life back to normal,\" says Olivia. \"During the initial evaluation, they asked me what my goals for the program were, and the first thing that I said was that I wanted to race again.\" She entered the program in January 2016. WILL TO WIN During her time at CSH, Olivia learned techniques for moving in a way that would help her manage the pain. Her natural competitiveness came out during timed activities like learning how to step in and out of a tub, or going for a walk outside. \"I always strived to beat my time from the day before,\" she recalls. Swimming, aquatic therapy and group and individual psychotherapy helped her learn to desensitize herself to pain and function normally. After four weeks, Olivia was feeling more in control of her CRPS\u2014and ready to get back to her senior year of high school. By the end of that year, she had been accepted into a prestigious university and was back to competitive sports. In 2019, nearly four years after her accident, Olivia competed in the Age Group Triathlon World Championships, the same competition she'd been training for when she crashed her bike. Olivia recalls the moments before the competition began: \"I remember thinking, 'I can't believe I'm actually here!' And that's when it all hit me: There's no way I would have been able to do it if it weren't for my time at Children's Specialized Hospital. The treatment I got there gave me the chance to live out my dreams.\" For more information about Children's Specialized Hospital, call 888.244.5373 or visit www.rwjbh.org/childrensspecialized.A COMPETITIVE ATHLETE ACHIEVES HER DREAMS THANKS TO AN INNOVATIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.A RACE AGAINST PAIN An RWJBarnabas Health facility Hard work at the Inpatient Chronic Pain Management Program enabled Olivia to compete in triathlons again.

Their exercise routines and nutritional habits are rooted in the principles of living healthy. Like our community, they rely on experts to help guide them along the way. That's why our partnership with RWJBarnabas Health is so important and works so well,\" says Steve Kalafer, Somerset Patriots Chairman Emeritus and RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH) trustee. Over the 22-year history of the partnership, RWJBH has hosted regular health fairs, blood drives and food drives, and has provided information on how community members can get access to key health services and screenings. Somerset Patriots players have benefited, too: RWJBH provides sports medicine services to keep players on the field of play. For kids, the Somerset Patriots, in partnership with the health system, created the Hit a Home Run Program. Featuring former pitcher Nate Roe, the education program for schools (delivered virtually this school year) is designed to teach young children how to eat healthier, make smarter lifestyle choices, be a good teammate and friend and understand the importance of exercise. FRIENDS IN NEED The Somerset Patriots team has been a stalwart supporter of RWJBH. Last summer, the organization raised more than $16,000 for the RWJBarnabas Health Emergency Response Fund to help support healthcare professionals as they served communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The money was raised in a variety of ways, including online auctions, merchandise sales of T-shirts and face masks, a pop-up shopping event and drive-in movies at TD Bank Ballpark. \"We are so grateful to the Somerset Patriots for their continued support of our hospital and our community throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, from donations of food for our staff to hosting blood drives and holding events to benefit our Emergency Response Fund,\" says Tony Cava, President and CEO of Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset, a pillar of healthcare throughout Central New Jersey. \"Their ongoing support helps ensure that our community has access to the comprehensive healthcare services they need.\" A SOURCE OF PRIDE RWJBH employees, many of whom live locally, take great pride in the partnership, attending games and participating in group events. Players feel that spirit as well. \"We pride ourselves on being active in our community to help make a difference,\" says Somerset Patriots President and General Manager Patrick McVerry. \"Our fans are always there for us at the ballpark and for all of our efforts.

Healthy Together | 16 | Spring 2021 System_SomersetPatriots_Spr21_final.indd 16 3/16/21 11:46 AM\"Salt is all over the place in our diets\u2014sometimes in obvious places like a salt shaker, and other times hidden in the food we consume,\" says Elie Chakhtoura, MD, Director of the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory at Clara Maass Medical Center and a member of RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group. \"The total amount of sodium we need is less than 500 milligrams a day, but most Americans consume north of 3,200 milligrams daily.\" That level of sodium can, over time, have bad effects on the body. \"It affects the brain, releasing hormones and reactive oxygen radicals that can increase blood pressure,\" Dr. Chakhtoura explains. \"Salt can also stress the sympathetic nervous system, which directs the body's response todangerous situations, so you have a kind of 'fight or flight' reaction.\" In addition, excess salt leads to fluid retention. \"Therefore, the volume of fluid in the blood vessels is increased and the heart has to work harder to pump it,\" he says. \"The excess force can cause high blood pressure and stiffening of the blood vessels. This will ultimately lead to harmful effects on the heart and kidneys.\" SODIUM IN HIDING To cut back on salt, first realize that most of what you get comes from unexpected places, Dr. Chakhtoura says. \"To the extent possible, avoid or minimize processed foods,\" he says. \"The worst offenders are canned soup, rice and noodle mixes, ketchup, mustard and bottled salad dressings. \"What I tell patients who are trying to cut down on salt is to read the label,\" he continues. \"You could already be at a third of your recommended daily amount of salt by the time you finish your bowl of breakfast cereal.\" Deli meat, smoked meats and cured meats are all loaded with salt, as is cheese, he adds. Eating out is also a potential hazard, Dr. Chakhtoura says. \"Restaurant food tastes good because it's high in both salt and fat, and that's especially true of fast- food places. Cutting back on eating out can be a major step in decreasing your salt intake. If you go to a restaurant or diner regularly, ask them if they can accommodate you by cutting back on the amount of salt in your meal.\" Over time, perhaps in just a few weeks, the craving for salt will go away, \"You will get used to spicing your food in other ways,\" Dr. Chakhtoura says. \"We don't need to be a prisoner of our diet; a bit of cheese with wine is not a big deal. Just use insight and good judgment. Also, exercise for 150 minutes over the course of a week to keep your blood vessels and blood pressure in good order.\"FLAVOR ALTERNATIVES: 6 SALT SWAPS \"Incorporate a variety of flavors into your diet and you may find yourself craving these instead of salt,\" says Heather Barraco, MS, RDN, CDCES, Clinical Nutrition Manager at Clara Maass Medical Center. 1.

HERE'S HOW TO KEEP IT HEALTHY. It's about the size of a walnut, just below the bladder and surrounding the urethra. Most men don't even realize it's there during their first few decades of life. But the prostate gland becomes more important to men as they age, and it could cause major trouble if it's left unchecked. \"Men often have few to no symptoms in the early stages of a prostate issue, even with a serious disease like prostate cancer,\" says Robert Caruso, MD, a urologist with Clara Maass Medical Center and a member of RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group. \"That's why routine prostate screening is so important.\" What does the prostate do? Located at the base of the bladder, the prostate gland produces fluid that nourishes and protects a man's sperm. Also, the muscles inside the prostate gland function as a valve. Those muscles close the bladder and keep urine in. How can I keep my prostate gland healthy? Being in overall good health will help your prostate gland stay in tip-top shape.

Also, exercise regularly to improve your circulation. How can I tell if my prostate isn't healthy? \"Symptoms of prostate issues include having a weak urine stream, urinary frequency, burning on urination, pelvic pressure sensation, waking up more than two times a night to urinate, feeling the need to strain or push when urinating, or having blood in the urine,\" Dr. Caruso says. What changes to the prostate occur over time? It grows bigger, which is a natural part of aging. \"Most men's prostate glands grow between 1 to 3 percent per year during their adulthood and inflammation may accelerate this growth,\" Dr. Caruso says. However, about 50 percent of men at age 50 will develop an enlarged prostate (also called benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH), which can cause discomfort and difficulty with urinating. By age 80, up to 90 percent of men have BPH. BPH is the most common prostate- related health concern. Other prostate problems include prostatitis, an inflammation of the prostate most often caused by infection, and prostate cancer. How is BPH treated? Treatment may include behavioral changes, such as minimizing caffeine and evening fluids, or medication to relax muscles in and around the prostate and make urination easier. If these measures aren't effective, next steps may include: Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).This procedure trims away excess tissue blocking urine flow. Simple prostatectomy, a removal of only the inner part of the prostate,\"rarely necessary these days,\" says Dr. Caruso. UroLift. In this brief, minimally invasive procedure, tiny implants lift the enlarged prostate out of the way to help improve urine stream and reduce urination frequency. Rezm. Done under mild anesthesia, this water vapor therapy infuses steam into the urethra, which relaxes the gland and opens the urethra. Like UroLift, it only takes a few minutes and can be done in the office. When should men begin screening for prostate cancer? Most men should start talking with a doctor about routine prostate cancer screening between the ages of 40 and 45. \"A shared decision-making process is used to determine the appropriate time and frequency of screening, depending on personal risk factors,\" says Dr. Caruso. \"If after initial evaluation men fall into a low-risk category, they may safely resume screening around age 50 to 55. African-American men and men with a family history of prostate, breast or ovarian cancer are encouraged to start the discussion at age 40.\" Screening includes two tests\u2014a physical exam of the prostate, also called a digital rectal exam, and a blood test that checks for the level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a protein made by cells in the prostate gland. Your doctor will determine follow-up screenings based on the results. What do PSA tests reveal? Doctors evaluate two factors. One is PSA velocity, a measure of PSA levels over time. \"If the velocity is more than 0.75 per year, that's considered significant and may indicate cancer,\" Dr. Carusosays. The other is PSA density, which compares the PSA to the size or volume of the prostate. If your PSA results indicate possible prostate cancer, your doctor will ask you to get a biopsy of the prostate, which will determine whether or not you have cancer. Some newer blood tests, such as 4Kscore and other genetic and genomic tests, can also help assess the risk of aggressive prostate cancer after an abnormal PSA or digital rectal exam.TREATMENTS FOR PROSTATE CANCER After skin cancer, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. One in eight men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime, according to the American Cancer Society. However, survival rates are very high, especially when the cancer is caught early. Because prostate cancer can be slow-growing, not every man will need to be treated right away. However, depending on the stage of the cancer, leading treatments include: Radiation therapy, utilizing a state- of-the-art linear accelerator that delivers external beam radiation with precision, or brachytherapy, in which radioactive material is sealed in a seed and placed inside the body. Cryotherapy, which uses extreme cold to freeze and kill prostate cancer cells. Radical prostatectomy, which removes the entire prostate gland, sometimes with nearby tissue, such as lymph nodes. Surgeons at CMMC use the da Vinci Robotic Surgical System, with tiny incisions for greater precision (the end of the instruments can bend like a human wrist) and up to 10 times magnification. This helps quicken recovery and reduce side effects or complications. To find a urologist at Clara Maass Medical Center, call 888.724.7123 or visit www.rwjbh.org/claramaass .

That has changed as a result of a collaborative effort from Clara Maass Medical Center (CMMC). A sign hangs above the entrance to the Blue Bear Laundry Room at the high school, which is outfitted with two high-quality commercial-grade washing machines and two gas dryers. All were purchased from Paul's Appliances, a small family-owned business that has been located in Newark since 1932. The laundry room, which is free for students, is one aspect of CMMC's strategy to prioritize the needs of its surrounding community through social impact and community investment initiatives. The laundry room project was identified as an initiative by Sarah Bonilla, MPH, Director of the Center of Excellence for Latino Health at CMMC, with the enthusiastic support of Mary Ellen Clyne, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of CMMC. MAKING A DIFFERENCE Families who are housing insecure often have few opportunities to do laundry. With a laundry facility at the school, students are able to wear clean clothes, thereby improving attendance, boosting confidence and ending bullying and ridicule. \"By partnering with the school to create the laundry facility, we are able to make an intentional, direct impact in the lives of our students and their families,\" says Bonilla, who also leads social impact and community investment and reinvestment initiatives for CMMC. \"We even purchased the equipment from a local supplier to ensure that this project makes a one-hundred percent investment in our community.\" The collaboration was formalized with a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between CMMC, RWJBarnabas Health and Newark Public Schools. \"We really want the community to see us as a good neighbor, a friend and as an anchor institution that benefits the community in various ways,\" says Dr. Clyne. \"We are grateful for this partnership, which will bring so much good for current and future students,\" says Jose Aviles, EdD, Principal of Barringer High School. The opening was attended by community leaders, including Newark Municipal Councilman At-Large Luis A. Quintana; North Ward Councilman Anibal Ramos, Jr.; Superintendent of Newark Public Schools Roger Le\u00f3n; members of the Newark Public Schools Advisory Board A'Dorian Murray-Thomas and the late Octavio \"Tave\" Padilla. Also in attendance was Akbar Cook, Principal of West Side High School in Newark, who created a laundry facility at that school.
