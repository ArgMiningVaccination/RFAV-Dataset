Some immi grant and minority ethnic groups struggle to use these services or adhere to selftreatment in an optimal way. Adapted health information and patient educat ion may benefit these groups. This overview of systematic revi ews summarises the effect of such adaptations. We found high quality systematic reviews about diabetes edu cation, asthma education and ca ncer screening information. These showed that adapted health information and patient education for immigrant and minority ethnic groups could entail a broad range of interventions of varying intensity. In some stud ies, the participants received a single culturally adapted educ a tion session. Other studies follo wed up the participants many times, giving them extra care and adapted resources over many months and years. Most studies were with minority ethnic groups in the USA. Alt hough the US health care syste m is different from the Norwe gian, we consider these results relevant to immigrant and mi nority ethnic groups in Norway experiencing similar barriers and challenges in using the health care services. Based on the summarised evidence, the anticip ated effects of adapted inter ventions compared to usual care are: Adapted diabetes education so mewhat improves longterm blood sugar levels in patients. The evidence mainly comes from studies with highly intense interventions. Adapted asthma education ma y give some fewer severe asthmatic exacerbations among c hildren, but the effect is unclear among adults. The evi dence comes from studies with interventions of rela tively low intensity. Adapted interventions to pro mote cancer s creening proba bly increase the number of women attending mammogra phy. The evidence comes from i nterventions that often in volved lay health workers and took place outside the health care sector. Title: Adapted health information and patient edu- cation for persons with immigrant or minority ethnic background: an overview of system- atic reviews Type of publication: Overview of systematic reviews A review of a clearly formulated question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise rele- vant research, and to collect and analyse data from the studies that are included in the review. Statistical methods (meta-analy-sis) may or may not be used to analyse and summarise the results of the included stud- ies. Doesn't answer everything: - Excludes studies that fall outside of the inclusion criteria - No health economic evaluation - No recommendations Publisher: The Norwegian Institute of Public Health has completed this review based on a re- quest from the Norwegian Centre for Migra- tion and Minority Health (NAKMI) Updated: Last search and Atle Abuelmagd, University of Oslo Hanne S\u00f8berg Finbr\u00e5ten, Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences 6 Executive summary Executive summary Background Health care services should be equitable for all. Some immigran t and minority ethnic groups use health care services to a lesser extent, in a differ ent way or have lower com pliance with recommend selftreatment than the general populati on. Limited access to adapted health information and pa tient education is one possibl e reason for these pat terns. This report gives an overview of summarized evidence on the effect of adapted health information and patient e ducation for immigrants or mino rity ethnic groups. Method This report is an overview of systematic reviews published in 2 012 or later. Inclusion criteria were reviews assessing the effects of any adapted heal th information or patient education compared to usual care or nonadapted information and education. The re views could include studies with populations of foreign origin, national minorities/mi nority ethnic groups or indigenou s people believed to have spec ific health problems, limited health literacy skills, language problems or challenges related to optimal use of health care services in their re sident country. We searched fou r electronic literature databases in May 2018. Two researchers independently screened 2 689 titles and ab stracts, and made final decisi ons on inclusion based on 55 full text assessments. Eligible systematic reviews were quality assessed and we only report res ults from high quality reviews. We used the review auth ors' analyses and, if available , their assessment of confidence in the evidence of ef fect for each outcome using the GRADE methodology. Using GRADE, we express our confidence that the estimated effec t is close to the antici pated effect of the intervention (the \"true effect\") as high, m oderate, low or very low for each outcome. Results We assessed the methodological qua lity of 22 systematic reviews that considered the effect of adapted health informa tion or patient education in re lation to six health issues or diagnoses: Adapted diabetes e ducation (9 reviews); Adapted a sthma education (3 reviews); Adapted information promoting cancer screening (5 rev iews); Adapted infor mation/education for diabetes pre vention (1 review); Adapted in formation promoting smoking cessation (1 review); Ot her types of adapted health inf ormation/patient edu cation (3 reviews). Systematic re views with similar research qu estions will include the same studies and have overlapping data and findings. We therefo re selected one sys tematic review presenting the ev idence best within each health issues or diagnoses. 7 Executive summary Thirteen systematic reviews were considered to b e of high metho dological quality, but these only investigated the thre e first categories: adapted dia betes education, asthma education and information promot ing cancer screening. We presen t results from one high quality systematic review for each of these categories. Sy stematic reviews con cerning the three next categorie s were of moderate methodologic al quality. Notably, these review authors presented results only using statistical s ignificance and direction of effect, without information on the effect size and its uncer tainty. For these topics, we present available studies, but n o results. The majority of the studies in these systematic reviews were conducted in the USA, most commonly with African A mericans and peo ple of Latin American origin. Ot her studies were from several E uropean countries, Can ada, Australia, New Zealand and a few Asian countries, and incl uded a variety of immi grant and minority ethnic group s. All study populations were ad ults, apart from studies on asthma education, which involve d both children and adult pat ients. The studies on adapted diabetes e ducation typically entailed a much more intense fol low up of the intervention group s than the control groups. Ofte n the participants re ceived several individual or g roup education sessions, counsell ing, and telephone fol lowup over an average period of 8 months. It is unclear if all the programs had cultur ally adapted content, and which u sed another language suiting t he participants or bilin gual health care personnel. Most studies compared adapted diabe tes education to standard diabetes care. The pati ents had relatively poor blood glucose control before the study. In total, 6536 partic ipants (28 studies) contributed to findings. Based on the summarised evidence, adapted dia betes education somewhat improv es longterm blood sugar levels in patients co mpared to usual care after six months (HbA1c values 0.5% lower, 95% confidence interva l (CI) 0.7% 0.4%, high con fidence in the esti mated effect); with still somewhat lower HbA1c values after 12 months and possibly after 24 months. It can possibly give patients more knowledge a bout diabetes and nu trition and higher selfefficacy scores (low confidence in the estimated effect). The studies on adapted asthma edu cation had interventions of lo w intensity, varying from only one education session up to three sessions. The inter ventions seemed to have involved culturally adapted content, but few details were presented. About half of the interventions provided writte n material using a language su iting the participants or used bilingual health care personnel. The control groups receiv ed either conventional asthma education or standard care. In total, 837 participants ( 7 studies) contributed to the findings. Based on the summarised evidence, adapted asthma education may give some fewer severe asthmatic exacerbations compared to usual car e among children (Relative risk 0.48, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.95, low confidence in the estimated effect). The data is too limited to consider likely effect for adults with a sthma. Of the four systematic reviews of high methodological quality, we present results from one concerning adapted information about mammography for Hispan ic women in the USA. The interventions in these studies generally used lay heal th workers from the same culture to deliver educatio nal sessions, outreach to women on arenas outside the health sector and mobile screening units offering free screenin g. The control group re ceived no specific interventions . In total, 2343 participants ( 5 studies) contributed to the findings. Based on the summa rised evidence, adapted interve ntions to promote cancer screening probably increas e the number of women attendin g mammography af 8 Executive summary ter 612 months (Odds ratio 1.67, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.26, moderate confidence in the esti mated effect). The three other high quality systematic reviews on this topic concerned adapted information on screening for different types of cancers (cervix, colorectal and prostate), interventions targeti ng other minorit y ethnic groups (minorities in the USA) and men. The results indicate fr om little or no difference to a moderately higher adher ence to cancer screenin g programs, when par ticipants receive ad apted information. The systematic reviews on adapted health information for diabet es prevention, smok ing cessation and some other hea lth concerns were all of modera te methodological quality. The reviews did not sum marise the pooled effects of th ese interventions. We still chose to give a brief pres entation of the reviews in this report to indicate the con siderable number of primary stud ies available on these topics. Discussion Most of the studies in the inclu ded reviews concerned African A merican and people of Latin American origin with low s ocioeconomic status in the USA. A high proportion of these participants have likely n o or poor health insurance. The re are fewer studies of adapted interventions for other immigrant and minority ethnic g roups and from coun tries with other health care sys tems. However, the defined stud y population in this overview relates to patient grou ps \"underusing\" or having spec ific challenges regard ing use of the health care services. We therefore consider the results relevant to immi grant and minority ethnic groups experiencing similar barriers and challenges in using the health care services, but not all immigrants and minority e thnic groups per se. The terms \"adapted health inform ation\" and \"adapted patient edu cation\" comprises a wide range of activities and int ensities of interventions. The interventions in these re views were generally complex, often including a substantial inc rease in the number of interactions the participants ha d with the health care services . Common activities were individual or group education sessions, extra counselling, or t elephone support, and not only linguistic or direct cultural adaptations. The included systematic reviews g ave limited descriptions of wh at the cultural adapta tions entailed. In particular, th e reviews give little insights into the use of learning aids (for instance pictures, movies, and comics) and if the interven tions adapted the mes sages to deeper cultural characte ristics of the target populati on. Many studies had in tervention components that are not strictly adhering to cultura l needs, but rather fi nancial, structural, social or e ducational barriers to accessin g appropriate health care. Examples are providing free acce ss to mammography services or g iving health infor mation in people's homes or on a renas outside the health care s ector. Since many of the interventions were intense with several different components gi ven together, we do not know which elements are most influential or necessary for a chieving the effects.

The overall prevalence of health problems is somewhat lower amo ng immigrants com pared to the general population, but disease patterns vary sign ificantly between immi grant groups (1, 2). Obesity, diabetes, and some cardiovascular diseases are, for in stance, more prevalent among persons of SouthEast Asian origin (1, 3, 4), while the risk of many types of cancers ar e lower (5). Selfrated health is somewhat lower and mental health problems higher among immigrants (2). Particularl y refugees have a higher prevalence of mental illn ess due to trauma and a vulnera ble life situation (68). Genetic variations can only part ially explain such differences in disease patterns be tween ethnic groups (9). Differences in cultural factors (e.g. practices and customs) may influence health status, but social, economic and structura l determinants of health appear to be associated with health inequities within and betwe en ethnic groups as well (1012). It is challenging to provide equ itable and appropriate health c are services for all popu lation groups. A thorough literat ure review from the USA reveal s that patients with im migrant or minority ethnic1 backgrounds do not have equa l access to health care com pared to the majority (\"White\") ethnic group, even when adjusti ng for sociodemo graphic differences such as educ ation and income (13). Norwegia n health care services are generally available to all, b ut data indicate that some imm igrant groups use these to a lesser extent or in a different way than the majority populat ion (2, 1417). Immi grants may use fewer preventive services, consult the health se rvices at a la ter stage of disease development, and come la ter into treatment with a risk of poorer prognosis. One explanation for these findings is that language barriers (1 820) and limited availa bility of adapted health information and patient education hamp er appropriate user be haviour and access to care (21, 22). Immigrants can have limite d knowledge about how 1 We use the term \"minority ethn ic\" rather than \"ethnic minority \" in this report. The te rm \"minority ethnic\" has been suggested to acknowledg e that ethnicity is a character istic of all individuals and groups, majori ties and minorities alike. The term \"ethnic minority\" may sugge st that the minority arose from sion\" of ethnicity itself ( https://www.universities scotland.ac.uk/raceequalitytoolkit/ter minology.htm ). 15 Background the health care services are org anised and their rights and dut ies as patients (23). Health professionals have genera lly little knowledge of what di fferent population groups know and do not know about health and illnesses, and how they can adapt and organize health information and patient education to immigrant groups (24, 25). Stud ies find that health professionals may feel bewildered and hesi tant in dealing with im migrant patients (13, 26, 27). Possible barriers from their sid e are stereotypical per ceptions, a lack of confidence a nd knowledge, and fear of actin g inappropriately (28). The health care services, like all other public services, have a responsibility to facilitate good communication and adapted i nformation. In Norway, the Act relating to Patients' Rights2 states: \" Information shall be adapted to the qualifications of the individual recip ient, such as age, maturity, experience and cultural and linguistic background. The infor mation shall be provided in a considerate manner. As far as possible, health personnel shall ensure that the patient has understood the contents and significance of the infor mation.\" (29). Patient education is an important management component i n treatment guidelines for many diseases; particularly chronic diseases whe re correct handling of medication, preventive lifestyl e changes and other selfcare p ractises are vital compo nents to prevent further disease progress. Internationally, the Ottawa Charter from 1986 states that health promotion is a process that enables peo ple to improve and maintain their health, and provi ding equal opportunities and re sources to develop per sonal skills through information , health education and knowledg e of mastering tech niques are important pillars (30). When people's starting point is different, a goal of equal oppo rtunities requires differ entiated services to suit dissimilar needs. An intensified focu s on adapted strategies to inform and educate immigrant or m inority ethnic patients is the refore timely. Health literacy as a determinant Obtaining and understanding heal th information is essential to make informed health decisions, and to prevent or mana ge disease. Such abilities are influenced by a person's health literacy level (31, 32). Early definitions of health lit eracy considered adequate literacy and numeracy skills and familiarity with medical termi nology and jargon as crucial components (33). These b asic competencies are referred to by Nutbeam as functional or fundamental health literacy (31). Modern health c are also have shared de cisionmaking as an exp licit goal, where the patient and health professionals make deci sions together related to treatme nt options (29). This requires ability to participate in dialogues and knowledge about health issues and own rights (34) , defined by Nutbeam as interactive health literacy (31). Relevant competencies also includes critical thinking and the ability to appraise diffe rent health information source s, such as advice from friends and family, through the media or from health care perso nnel (35); Nutbeam's 2 LOV1999070263. Lov o m sloven). 16 Background third level critical health lite racy. Knowledge about how the h ealth services are orga nized and how to navigate in thi s system is also essential to g et optimal treatment and employ good selfcare (34, 36). S\u00f8 rensen and colleagues, who re gard health literacy as a multidimensional concept, have developed a more comprehensive model of health lit eracy with the following definition: \"Health literacy is linked to literacy and entails people's knowledge, motivation and competences to access, understand, appraise, and apply health information in order to make judgments and take decisions in everyday life concerning healthcare, dis ease prevention and health promotion to maintain or improve quality of life during the life course.\" (33) Literature reviews on the associ ation between health literacy a nd relevant health out comes show that individuals with low health literacy levels ten d to have poorer health, use preventive health care services less (for instance vaccinat ion), use drugs incor rectly more often, and use diffe rent health care services inapp ropriately (37, 38). Based on studies from several countries, low health literacy appear t o be relatively common in the general population (38, 3 9). Immigrants tend to be among the population groups with low health literacy scores (3941). Limited health literac y skills have been indi cated as a possible explanatory factor for refraining from seek ing appropriate health care among refugees (42). However, it is important to acknowled ge that there will be variations in health literacy levels both within and between gr oups. Adapted health information and patient education In this report, we summarize the effect of adapted patient educ ation and health infor mation provided as part of health care services. The term health information is used in this report as advice and guidance provided by health care professionals and others promoting good health, pre venting illness or en suring proper followup of drug use and selfcare. Education can be understood as teaching with the intention to i nduce learning by promoting kno wledge, skills and atti tudes. Health educatio n can address a heal th issue or a diagnos is, medical treatments or recommended selfcare behavio urs. In this report, we include information or educa tion given directly to an individ ual, as well as given in a gro up setting. However, public health interventions, such as ca mpaigns, or syst embased interv entions, fall outside of this description. Questions about the effect of targeted mass m edia campaigns and sys temlevel health care interventi ons are explored in two other s ystematic reviews from the Norwegian Institute of P ublic Health (43, 44). Adapted information and education may have many forms and may include: Linguistic adaptation so that th e information meets the target group at the right functional level, including using the patients' preferred langu age/native language. Adapted to cultural or religious beliefs and values, life circu mstances and history. Adapted didactic method (e.g. th eoretical approaches, different degree of participa tion, individual or groupbased teaching). Adapted format of information and training material (e.g. graph ics) 17 Background Adapted type of communication (e.g. text, audio or image). Adapted amount and intensity (e. g. how often and how much infor mation is given). Within the theoretical field of health communication, it is com mon to distinguish be tween targeted communication and tailored communication. Kreute r and Wray (45) describes targeted health communication as communication \"intended to reach some population subgroup based on char acteristics presumed to be sha red by the group's members\". A targeted approach coincides with the term audience segmentation in so cial marketing theory, that is, the identification of meaningfu l differences among popu lation groups that affect their r esponses to the promoted actio n. This approach is only relevant if the targeted population is sufficiently homogeneous (45, 46). A targeted ap proach should also carefully consider ethical aspects to avoid stereotyping and stigma tising. Tailored health communication , on the other hand, is adapted to the specific characteristics of an individual based on individual level fact ors related to the health or behavioural outcome of inter est (45). Another concept, culturally adapted interventions , involve, according to Bernal and colleagues (47), changes that \"consider language, cul ture, and context in such a way that it is compatible with the client's cultural patterns, meanings, and values\". Cultural adaptation strategies have been categorised by Res nicow and colleagues (48) into su rface adjustments and deep str ucturallevel adjust ments. Surfacelevel adjustments involve changing factors su ch as language, graphics, food and clothing to match the target audience. Deep structural level adjustments are changes that reflect t he cultural, social, h istorical, environm ental, and psychological forces behind behaviours in the target population. We expected that relevant interven tions could relate to one concept or several of concepts, but t hat it could be difficult to differentiate between different types of adapted interventions. Definition of the study population In this report, we include resea rch on adapted interventions fo r both immigrants and minority ethnic groups. Although these groups may have differen t needs, all such stud ies may provide relevant informa tion on the impact of adapted i nterventions per se. The terms immigrants and minorit y ethnic groups are defined dif ferently in different countries and contexts. Statisti cs Norway identifies immigrants as follows: \"Persons born abroad by two foreignborn parents. Immigrants have at one point immigrated to Norway. \"(49) This definition is wide and narrow at the same ti me. It is wide because it includes any nationality and any length of time a s residents in the country. It is also narrow, as it does not include chi ldren born in Norway of two f oreignborn parents. There is no international consensus on how ethnicity is defined , but the researcher Raj Bhopal has summarized important elements found in different def initions: \"The concept of ethnicity implies, according to most accounts, one or more of the fol lowing: shared origins or social background; shared culture and traditions which are distinctive, maintained between generations, and lead to a sense of identity and groupness; a common language or religious tradition\" (9). Bhopal points out that these definitions use social and cultura l factors instead of biolog ical (physical appearances or gen etic differences) to define po pulation groups. Minority 18 Background ethnic groups are sometimes divi ded into indigenous peoples (gr oups associated with an area from before current state borders were established) (50 ), national minorities (groups with longterm ties to th e country)(51), and immigrants . In Norway, indige nous peoples and national minorit ies are recognized as own cult ural groups (52, 53), but affiliation to these groups are not registered. Since we did not want to limit the number of studies unnecessar ily, no specific defini tions of immigrants and minority ethnic groups was used. The st udy population for this report was defined pragmatically : Groups of people of foreign o rigin, national minori ties/minority ethnic groups or i ndigenous people who in the ide ntified studies are be lieved to have specific health p roblems, limited health literac y skills, language prob lems or challenges rel ated to optimal use of health care servic es in their resident coun try. This definition also include children born in a country of two foreignborn parents. Mandate and aim The former Norwegian Centre for Migration and Minority Health, now Unit for Migra tion and Health, Norwegian Instit ute of Public Health, commissi oned this report. They plan to develop a guide for health care professionals and other s who work with immi grants on how to provide appropri ate health information and pat ient education to im migrant groups. This report will inform the development of that guide. Phase one of the project was a systematic literature search to identify the scope of pub lished systematic reviews and pr imary studies on adapted health information and pa tient education for immigrants a nd/or minority ethnic groups. T he systematic litera ture search, published as a memo in April 2017 (54), identified 96 potentially relevant literature reviews within a broader topic area. This report is phase two of the project. The aim was to prepare an overview of high quality systematic reviews published in 2012 or later on the ef fect of adapted health in formation and patient education for immigrants or persons with minority ethnic back grounds. 19 Methods Methods The methods in this report follo ws the procedures for overviews of systematic reviews given in the handbook used at the Division for Health Services, Norwegian Institute of Public Health (55). As this proj ect is part two of a larger pro ject, the methods builds on the previously completed memo (54) . Inclusion and exclusion criteria Study design: Systematic reviews published in 2012 or later, ju dged to be of high meth odological quality. Population: Groups of people of foreign ori gin, national minorities/minori ty ethnic groups or indigenous peop le who in the identified studie s are believed to have specific he alth problems, limited health l iter acy skills, language problems or challenges related to optimal use of health care services in their resident country. Intervention: Any adapted health information o r patient education provided as personal followup to patients under the organisational structu re of the health service. Control: Not adapted health information o r patient education. Usual care . Outcome : Relevant outcomes included, but was not limited to: - Health outcomes - Knowledge and understanding - Selfefficacy - Compliance with recommended treatment - Participation in health decisions - Use of health services - Costs Language : Any language. We excluded systematic rev iews that only included: Measures directed at health care professionals (e.g. health car e professionals only) Systembased measures (e .g. mass media campaigns) Organizational measures (e.g. different treatment team configur ations) 20 Methods Publications were systematic revi ews if they had described or p resented 1) a system atic literature search, 2) clear criteria for relevant studies to include, and 3) quality as sessment of the included studies (56). Literature search The literature search for this re port is based on the search pe rformed in 2017 (54) and updated in May 2018. A research librarian (GSH) performed the l iterature search (Ap pendix 1) and another librarian peer reviewed the search. We se arched in: Cochrane Library ( CDSR, DARE, HTA) MEDLINE PsycINFO Embase In addition, we checked against th e previously identified syste matic reviews (54). Two researchers (AM, GEV) independen tly assessed the publications a ccording to the inclu sion criteria, first from title an d abstract, and then relevant populations in full text. In cases of disagreement, we consulted a third person. Assessment of methodological quality and overlap between reviews We assessed the quality of inclu ded reviews based on a checklis t for systematic reviews (55). Pairs of two people (AM, AA, GEV) considered each publica tion independently of each other based on nine checkli st questions and decided on the methodological quality through discussions until consensus (see Appendix 3 for quality assessment of all the reviews). Further, we sorted the systemati c reviews according to themes b ased on which health issues or diagnoses the intervent ion addressed. T his was done t o consider whether the included reviews had overlapping scope and content. Within each of the identified themes, the reviews were sorted according to the date of the li terature search. We pre sent results within each theme from the high quality review wit h the newest literature search. However, if the high quality review with the newest lit erature search was re stricted to specific ethnic grou ps or countries, we considered another recent high qual ity review with a wider study population. Appendix 4 contains d ocumentation on themes, overlap and final select ion of reviews contributing to the results. Data extraction and analyses AM retrieved information from the systematic reviews and GEV ch ecked its accuracy. We only extracted information fr om the systematic review itself , including any supple mentary tables or appendixes. None of the included primary stud ies was retrieved to provide additional information ab out interventions or results. 21 Methods From the systematic reviews prov iding results in our review, we obtained information about the study populations in th e included primary studies, ch aracteristics of the in terventions and control groups, duration of interventions and f ollowup times, and in formation about who provided the intervention. In addition, we used the available in formation to assess the following: the likely intervention \"dos e\" (i.e. the number of times participants in the interv ention group were offered an ac tivity, teaching sessions, counselling or similarly); indiv idual or group teaching session s; linguistic adaptation; content adaptation of the interv ention; whether studies approac hed participants on arenas outside the health sector; and use of lay persons in the intervention. Presented results are based on ou tcomes and analyses found in t he systematic reviews. The effect estimates were risk ratio (RR), odds ratio (OR), sta ndardised mean differ ence (SMD) or other relevant mea sures presented in the included systematic reviews, with 95% confidence intervals (C I) or other relevant measures o f dispersion. If results from metaanalyses were presente d both using fixed and random m odels, we reported results from the ran dom effect model. Judgements about certainty of the evidence We assessed our confiden ce in the evidence of effect for each o utcomes using the GRADE methodology (the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, D evelopment and Evaluation) (57). If the systematic review authors already had completed a GRADE as sessment, we reviewed their gradi ng and judgements. Using GRADE , we describe our trust in the effect estimates as high, moderate, low or very lo w for each outcome. Table 1: GRADE Working Group grades of evidence, symbols used and their inter pretation to describe our confidence in the pooled estimate of effect. Category Symbol Interpretation High confi dence We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that o f the estimate of the effect. Moderate confidence We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Low confi dence Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true ef fect may be substantially diffe rent from the estimate of the effect. Very low confidence We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be subs tantially different from the es ti mate of effect. The grading represents our confid ence in the evidence of effect based on the available studies. The GRADEmethodology h as five criteria for possible d owngrading of the quality of the documentation: stu dy limitations, inconsistency between studies, indi rectness of evidence, imprecisi on and reporting bias. In additi on, observational studies can be considered for upgrading by the following three criteria : strong associations, 22 Methods dose response effects and contro l for confounding factors. The assessments and the reasons for the judgements are pr esented in summary of findings tables. Ethics Considerations about ethical issu es are not part of this assign ment. However, we acknowledge that there can be et hical challenges related to giv ing adapted health infor mation or patient education (e.g . risk of stereotyping and stig matising) as well as ethi cal challenges if health informa tion or patient education are n ot adapted to population groups in need of such measures. 23 Results Results Results of the literature search The search obtained 2689 references in the selected databases ( Figure 1). We excluded 2634 of these based on the title or summary. Fiftyfive referen ces were retrieved in full text. Thirtythree of these did not fulfil the inclusion criter ia, mainly because they were not systematic reviews or concerne d other types of intervention s (Appendix 2). Figure 1: Flow chart for search results and handling of references. Assessment of quality and overlap between systematic reviews We assessed the methodological qua lity of 22 systematic reviews (5879) (summarised in Appendix 3). These considered the effect of adapted health i nformation or patient education in relation to six health issues or diagnoses: Adapted diabetes education (9 reviews) References excluded based on title and abstract (n = 2634) Results from systematic review (n = 3) Presented available studies in review, but no results (n = 3) References excluded with reasons (n = 33) Systematic reviews not presented due to: Methodological quality (n = 6) Overlap with more relevant systematic review (n = 10) Systematic reviews assessed for methodological quality and overlap regarding topics and studies (n = 22) References retrieved for assessment in ful l text (n = 55) References identified through electronic searches (n=2689) 24 Results Adapted asthma education (3 reviews) Adapted information promoting cancer screening (5 reviews) Adapted information/education fo r diabetes prevention (1 review ) Adapted information promoting smoking secession (1 review) Other types of adapted health information/patient education (3 reviews) We considered that nine systematic reviews had moderate methodo logical quality (58, 60, 62, 64, 65, 67, 69, 78, 80), and the other thirteen had hig h methodological quality. Systematic reviews that have the same or a similar research que stion will - if con ducted thoroughly and about the same time - include the same st udies. For instance, the nine systematic reviews on ad apted diabetes education inclu ded many of the same primary studies and therefore have overlapping data and finding s. Thus, for the three first health issues or diagnoses, we present results from one s ystematic reviews of high methodological quality with the newest search date and widest p opulation search. However, among the reviews on adapted information promoting can cer screening, four reviews had high methodological quality. All four were somewhat restricted to specific ethnic groups, concerned different cancer types or only one gen der. We decided to pre sent results from the newest sys tematic review on cancer screen ing (71), and briefly comment on the results of the rem aining three systematic review s on adapted health information promoting cancer screening. Within the three last categories, we only found systematic revi ews of moderate meth odological quality. For these, w e present the available primary studies, but do no report findings as these are inappropri ately summarised in the reviews . Appendix 4 contains justification for selectio n of systematic reviews. Adapted diabetes education Among the nine systematic reviews on adapted education for diab etes patients, we pre sent results from Attridge and c olleagues, published in 2014 (5 9). The authors searched for interventions consid ered to be \"culturally appropr iate (or adapted) health education\" for patients with diabetes, defined as: \u00abCulturally appropriate health education is defined here as education that is tai lored to the cultural or religious beliefs and linguistic skills of the community being approached, taking into account likely literacy skills [...]. It could include adapting established health education to innovative delivery methods, such as using commu nitybased health advocates, delivering the information to samegender groups or adapting dietary advice to fit the likely diet of a particular community . \u00bb (p.8 (59)) Eligible studies were randomized , controlled stud ies of adults (> 16 years) belonging to a minority ethnic community in a middle or highincome country who had confirmed diabetes mellitus type 2. The literature search was from July 2 013. The review included 33 studies with in total 7453 participants, but only 28 studies had relevant data for the analyses (6536 participants). Appendix 5 contains a reference l ist and detailed presen tation of study populations, dur ation of studies, intervention and control treatments, and additional extracted informa tion for each included study in the review. 25 Results Most of the studies were conducted in USA (27 studies), and oth erwise in the UK, the Netherlands and Canada (Table 2, next page). Almost half of the North American stud ies targeted African Americans an d the remainder mostly Latin A merican groups. The European studies targeted Asian immigrant groups. Table 2: Country and study population included in Attridge 2014. Country Study population1 (number of studies) USA African American (10) Latin American origin (12) Both African American and Latin American origin (2) East Asian immigrants (1) Native Americans, Amer ican Polynesian (2) UK South Asian immigrants (4) The Netherlands Southeast Asian origin/immigrants (1) Canada Latin American immigrants (1) 1 Study population as described by review authors. Attridge and colleagues commente d that the participants often h ad low socioeconomic status and that study authors di scussed high prevalence of diab etes, poor dietary hab its, insufficient physical activ ity levels and communication ba rriers as common chal lenges to provide good care for these groups. The study populat ions appear to have had relatively poor blood glucose cont rol. Average values for glyca ted haemoglobin (HbA1c) - a measure of longterm blood sugar - in the control g roups ranged from 7.8% to 12.2% in various studies (see Table 3). In Norway, the treatment target for HbA1c for most patients with typ e 2 diabetes is around 7% (81). The interventions varied consider ably in the included studies ( Appendix 5): The studies lasted from 3 to 36 months (last follow up). Median duration was 6 months and the mean 8 months. The least intensive intervention was one teaching session only, while most inter ventions provided regular follow up regularly over time - the l ongest two years. Eleven studies offered group int erventions, 13 studies offered oneonone educa tion or counselling, and 9 studie s offered a comb ination of bot h. One intervention had multimedia content only. Nurses (in 16 studies) and dieticians (in 12 studies) frequentl y provided the inter vention. Sixteen studies used link workers or community health workers, while four studies used lay workers to deliver the intervention - in addition to health care workers or alone. About half of the studies based the intervention on previous qu alitative work, experi ence with the study population or involvement of user represent atives. Some theoreti cal models used were empowerment theory, transtheoretical mode l for behavioural change, and socialcognitive the ory. Attridge and colleagues su mmarise only sparingly in what way and to what extent these interventions were cultura lly, linguistically or otherwise adapted. Based on our extracted information, we assum e the participants had a different prefe rred language than the majority population in almost half of the 26 Results studies. About one third of the studies approached participants on arenas outside the health sector. We also estimated the number of times participan ts in the intervention groups were offered an activity (intervention \"dose\"), e.g. ind ividual or group education sessions, counselling, telephone c ontact or similarly. In all b ut two studies, participants in the intervention groups were offered at least 34 extra acti vities compared to the control groups. In about half of the studies, the difference in dose was at least 10 addi tional activities; in four studies at least 30 additional activ ities (Appendix 5). The control groups were given ei ther conventional diabetes educ ation or usual diabe tes care. The review authors dis cussed that usual care may vary widely between coun tries, but chose to present this as one comparison. Half of the studies offered no inter vention apart from usual care fo r the control group, while seve ral studies of fered some minimal \"nonculturally adapted\" intervention such as leaflets, newsletters or tele phone calls to maintain interest in further data collection. Tw o studies compared the intervention to a nonculturally adapted intervention of simila r intensity, i.e. generic diabetes education. Attridge and colleagues presented effect estimates on three pri mary and 41 secondary outcomes at 3, 6, 12 and 24 mont hs. We present results for the three primary outcomes (HbA1c, healthrelated quality of life, and adverse event/outco mes of the intervention), and two secondary outcomes (know ledge and selfefficacy scores) (Table 3). The au thors used GRADE to assess their confidence in evidence of effe ct. We considered their judgements appropriate. Our GRADE assessment is based on the as sumption that the effect sizes are relevant for patients from immigrants or minor ity ethnic groups with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type 2. The documentation in Table 3 show s effects of ada pted diabetes education for patients belonging to a minority ethnic community compared to usual care or conventional edu cation. 27 Results Table 3: Effects of adapted diabetes education compared to usual care. Population : Adults (>16 year) from a minor ity ethnic group in a middle or highincome country with diabetes type 2. Countries : USA, UK, The Netherlands, and Canada.

CI: Confidence interval; RCT: Ra ndomised, controlled study; SMD : Standardised mean difference. Based on the summarised evidence, patients receiving adapted di abetes education have: somewhat lower HbA1c values after six months still somewhat lower HbA1c values after 12 months and possibly also after 24 months. possibly more knowledge about diabetes and nutrition. possibly higher selfefficacy scores. Few studies looked for possible adverse events or outcomes of t he intervention. These did not register any relevant incidents. 28 Results Adapted asthma education Among the three systematic reviews on adapted asthma education, we present results from McCallum and colleagues, pub lished in 2017 (72). The autho rs searched for inter ventions considered to be \"cultu reoriented asthma programmes\", defined as: \"An education programme is defined as a programme which transfers information about asthma in any form, including but not limited to, adapting the programme to the culturevalues, language, and/or using educators who come from the same cul ture, inclusion of beliefs and practices, culturally appropriate role models, involve ment of local community health workers to support clinical teams etc.\" (p.6 (72)) Eligible studies were randomized , controlled studies of childre n or adults from a mi nority ethnic group according to the country's own definition w ho had physiciandiag nosed asthma. The literature sea rch was from June 2016. The rev iew included seven studies with total 837 participa nts. Appendix 6 contains a refe rence list and detailed presentation of study populations , duration of studies, interve ntion and control treat ments, and additional extracted in formation for each included s tudy. Table 4: Country and study population included in McCallum 2017 (72). Country Study population1 (number of studies) USA African American (1) Latin American (1) Both African American an d Latin American (1) Australia Aboriginals (1) Canada Immigrants with first la nguage other than English (1) India Indian (1) UK Asian descent (1) 1 Study population as described by review authors. The studies were conducted in USA, Australia, Canada, India and UK (Table 4). The studies targeted both minority e thnic and immigrant groups. It is unclear whether the study from India concerned a minor ity ethnic group, but it invo lved adapting a patient education program from English t o an Indian language and subcu lture. Two studies in cluded adults only, four studies only children and one study in cluded both older chil dren and adults. The definition of asthma varied between the st udies. The review authors commented tha t culturespecific programs wer e defined differently for each study and varied in content: The studies lasted from 4 to 12 months (last follow up). The interventions varied in int ensity from one session (3 studi es) up to three ses sions delivered over 6 months. Six studies gave the participant s individual education or couns elling (in child stud ies with family members). One in tervention had multimedia conte nt only. 29 Results Different health professionals pr ovided the asthma education in most of the stud ies. In three studies, these wer e persons with bilingual skills or from the same cul tural group as the study population. The review authors present few d etails regarding the theoretica l and practical aspects of the cultural adaptations done . Based on our extracted inform ation, we assume par ticipants had a different prefe rred language than the majority population in four of the seven studies. One study approach ed the participants outside th e health sector and of fered home visits and telephone calls. The estimated difference in intervention \"dose\" between the intervention group a nd the control group varied fro m no extra activities in the studies (one study comparing two different cultural formats ) up to three extra ac tivities (Appendix 6). The control groups were either provided with conventional train ing or standard asthma care. In most studies, this involved giving some resourc es, such as standard in formation or leaflets. However, one study compared giving three standard education modules (control group) with giv ing three education modules ada pted to the socioeco nomic or cultural context of ethnic minorities (intervention gr oup). One study com pared one standard edu cation module with additional three educa tional sessions led by trained, Indigenous health care workers. McCallum and colleagues present effects on four primary and sev en secondary out comes after 6 to 24 m onths. All primary outcomes were related t o asthmatic exacerba tions and need for treatment. We present findings for these (Ta ble 5), but for any no secondary outcomes, as the amount of data was limited. The revi ew authors had not ex tracted data about adverse outco mes of the intervention. The a uthors used GRADE to assess their confidence in evidence of effect. We considered th eir judgements appropri ate. The documentation in Table 5 show s effects of ada pted asthma ed ucation for patients belonging to a minority ethnic group compared to usual care or conventional educa tion. 30 Results Table 5: Effects of adapted asthma education compared to usual care. Population : Children or adults from a minority ethnic group in their coun try with asthma. Countries : USA, Australia, Canada, India and UK.

CI: Confidence interval; RCT: Ra ndomised, controlled study; MD: Mean difference. Based on the summarised evidence, patients receiving adapted as thma education have: possibly a small reduction or no difference in the number of se vere asthmatic exac erbations requiring hospit alisation among children. possibly no difference in the overall number of exacerbations a mong children. The data is too limited to consid er likely effects among adults on the number of asth matic exacerbations, number of pa corticos teroids and number of severe exacerbations. We have no available evidence on whether this intervention has adverse effects. 31 Results Adapted information promoting cancer screening Among the four high quality syst ematic reviews on adapted infor mation promoting cancer screening, we present results from the newest by Luque a nd colleagues, pub lished in 2018 (71). Since this review only covers mammography screening among LatinAmerican women living in the USA, we comment on findings from the three other reviews regarding cancer screenin g towards the end of this chap ter. Luque and colleagues (71) searched for educational intervention s to increase mam mography screening among Hispanic women, but did not define thi s intervention any further. Eligible studies were randomized, controlled trials, casecontrol trials, quasi experimental studies or prospect ive study with historical contr ols. The studies should aim to increase mammog raphy screening among Hispanic women livi ng in the USA. At least 50% of the study sample had to be Hispanic and, if the st udy targeted multiple population groups, with results presented separately for Hispan ic participants. They only included studies conducted after 2003, when the American C ancer Society revised their screening guidelines. The literature search was from Sept ember 2017. The review included five studies with total 3578 participants, of which 23 43 provided data for the main outcome. Three of the inclu ded studies were randomized, co ntrolled trials, while two were clusterrandomised tria ls. Appendix 7 contains a refer ence list and detailed presentation of study population, duration of study, interventi on and control treat ment, and additional extracted in formation for each of the incl uded studies. By inclusion criteria, all studie s were from the USA, targeting adult, Hispanic women. The majority of the participants were foreignborn (immigrants) , predominantly from Mexico, and the remaining were U Sborn of LatinAmerican origin . Luque and col leagues stated that a high proportion of the participants had l ower socioeconomic sta tus and were without health insurance. Key descriptions of the interventions were: The studies lasted from 8 to 24 months (last follow up). Three studies gave the participa nts two intervention sessions, while one study gave six sessions delivered over 6 w eeks. In one study, it was uncle ar if the participants were exposed to the intervention more than once. Two studies gave the participants individual education; two stu dies gave group ed ucation, while one study combined the two. One study provided f ree access to mammography services de livered by a mobile unit in addition to health infor mation. All five studies used a lay heal th worker, predominantly a \"pro motora\"3. One of these studies also involved a peer cancer survivor. 3 A \"promotora\" is lay Hispanic /Latino community member who rece ives training to provide basic health education without being a professional health care worker. 32 Results Based on our extracted informati on, we assume that all particip ants were Spanish speaking and that these \"promoto ra\"led interventions were ling uistically adapted. All studies approached the participa nts on arenas outside the healt h sector. The control in tervention was not specified for these studies, but we assume t hat all comparisons were against no specific interve ntion. The estimated difference in intervention \"dose\" between the intervention group a nd the control group was two to six extra activities in the intervention group compared no activities for the control g roup, apart from one study with unclear intervention dose (Appendix 8). The effects of the interventions were measured as OR for mammog raphy screening during the follow up period (from 6 to 12 months). The authors had not performed a GRADE assessment, so we assessed the confidence in evidence of effect based on the available information in the review (71). The documentation in Table 6 shows effects of adapted health in formation promoting cancer screening compared to usua l care (no intervention). The findings are based on studies of Hispanic women and mammography screening only. Table 6: Effects of adapted health information promoting cancer screening com pared to usual care (no intervention). Population : Hispanic women living in the USA. Countries : USA.

Based on the summarised evidence , Hispanic women receiving adap ted information about cancer screening: have probably moderately higher adherence to mammography screen ing pro grammes after 612 months We have no available evidence on adverse effects of the interve ntion. In addition to the review by Luque and colleagues (46), we iden tified three relevant systematic reviews of high metho dological quality, all publishe d in 2012 (70, 74, 77), what is briefly presented here. 33 Results The aim of Lu and colleagues (70) was to summaris e studies asse ssing interventions to increase the uptake of breast and cervical cancer screening amo ng Asian women. This definition included both women living in Asian countries and As ian immigrants/ women of Asian origin in other countries. About half of the 37 included studies were conducted among Asian women livi ng in USA, otherwise Asian wome n living in the UK, Canada, New Zealand or Australia , or in their home countries Ta iwan, Thailand, Singa pore, Hong Kong, India or Malaysi a. This review included very d iverse types of inter ventions, for example print base d information or letters, home education, outreach workers, communitybased educati on, cultural awareness training of health profes sionals, media campaign s or free/subsidised/mobile screening se rvices, given either alone or in various combinations. Only 18 studies reported a va lid outcome measure ment. Findings ranged from no effect of the intervention to som ewhat increased adher ence to breast or cervical cance r screening. We have not assess ed our confidence in the effect estimates using GRADE. Naylor and colleagues (74) aimed to review the literature on in tervention to improve the colorectal cancer care, inclu ding adapted information promo ting screening, among racial or ethnic minorities, but included only studies from USA . Most of the studies ad dressed African Americans, other wise Hispanics, Asian or other ethnic groups. This re view divided the types of interv entions into patientlevel inte rventions (i.e. educational interventions of individual or i n groups, media based informati on, multilingual inter ventions with print, lay worker or interpreter services); patie ntnavigator interven tions (i.e. support to schedule appointments, reminders, assist ance with transportation, translation services, or similar ); or provider/systemlevel int erventions (i.e. multi modal interventions with differe nt components including some ad dressing health care personnel or organisation of care and patient flows). The revie w authors concluded that the interventions increase colorectal screening rates in t he order of about 10 to 15 percentage points. We have not a ssessed our confid ence in the e ffect estimates. Sajid and colleagues (77) reviewed the literature on interventi ons to improve decision making and reduce racial and ethnic disparities in prostate can cer management. The relevant subsection of this review concerned interventions to increase informed deci sion making about prostate canc er screening. Inclusion criteria were studies conducted in the USA involving at least 50% participants from a minority ethnic group, and rele vant studies included predominantly African American men. The r eview authors di vided these into studies of educ ational , printed mater ials/booklets, tele interventions or s elfefficacy for deci sionmaking interventions. In these studies, culturally adapted content of the infor mation appeared to have a prominent role. The review authors in dicate increased knowledge about prostate cancer screening among participants. W e have not assessed our confidence in th e effect estimates. Adapted information or education for diabetes prevention We identified only one systematic review on adapted information or education for dia betes prevention, published by Lagisetty and colleagues in 2017 (68). This review was assessed to be of moderate method ological quality (Appendix 3). Notably, the authors 34 Results presented results only using stat istical significance (pvalues ) and direction of effect (increased or decreased), without information on the effect siz e or level of uncertainty. In order to give a trustworthy summary of the evidence, it woul d be necessary to re trieve and extract data from all the primary studies, which was beyond the scope of this overview of systematic reviews. Instead, we give a short presen tation of the availability of relevant studies based on Lagi setty and colleagues' review ( Appendix for \"culturally t argeted strategies\", defined as : \u00ab... the terms cultural targeting and tailoring include strategies that improve the health of a racial and ethnic population by taking into account their cultural prac tices, attitudes, and beliefs. The distinction between targeting (which is often thought as group level programming), and tailoring (which is thought of as individ ual level programming as these concepts often overlap in community based inter ventions), is not made.\u00bb (s.55, (68)). Eligible studies were randomized and quasirandomized of adults from ethnic groups that differ from the dominant population in their resident coun try. The participants should be at risk to develop dia betes mellitus type 2. The lite rature search was from June 2016. The review included 35 studies (see Appendix 8 for r eference list), mostly conducted in USA (26 studies) an d otherwise in Canada and India (two studies each), and one respectively in the Neth erlands, New Zealand, Norway an d the UK (Table 7). Table 7: Country and study population included in Lagisetty 2017. Country Study population1 (number of studies) USA African American (8) Latin American origin (8) Both African American and Latin American origin (3) East Asian origin/immigrants (2) Southeast Asian (1) Arab American (1) Native Americans, Amer ican Polynesian (3) Canada Native Americans (2) India Indian (2) The Netherlands Southeast Asian origin/immigrants (1) New Zealand Aboriginals (1) Norway South Asian immigrants (1) UK South Asian immigrants (1) 1 Study population as described by review authors. The review by Lagisetty and colle agues shows that there is a si gnificant number of available primary studies on adapted health information or educ ation for diabetes pre vention. 35 Results Adapted information promoting smoking cessation We only identified one systemati c review on adap ted health info rmation promoting smoking cessation, published by Liu and colleagues in 2013 (69) . This review was as sessed to be of moderate methodol ogical quality (Appendix 3). I n this review as well, the authors presented results onl y using statistical significan ce and direction of effect, without information on the effect size or its level of uncertai nty. We give a short over view of the studies in Liu and colleagues' review (Appendix 9). The authors searched for interve ntions considered to be \"adapte d smoking cessation interventions for ethnic mi nority groups\" defined as: \u00abInterventions for smoking cessation in ethnic minority groups should thus be adapted accordingly to take into account these unique patterns [preferred tobacco products and use] of risk and protective factors [...], as well as other culturally rele vant dimensions such as values, beliefs and practices.\u00bb (p.766, (69)) The review included studies with any study design aiming to ass ess the effect of health promotion interventions on smoking cessation targeting children and nonpregnant adults of African, Chinese or South Asianorigin. The literat ure search was from April 2013. The review included 28 studies (see Appendix 9 for refere nce list). All the in cluded studies were conducted in USA, of which 23 studies were adapted for African American groups and five for Chinese American groups. The review by Liu and colleagues shows that there is a substant ial number of primary studies on adapted health informa tion promoting smoking cessati on. Other types of adapted health information and patient education Three systematic reviews did not fall clearly int o any of the o ther categories above (60, 62, 64). They were all considered to be of moderate methodologi cal quality, all with some limitations in the way the results were presented. The thr ee reviews focused on: interventions to improve cultura l competency in health care for Indigenous peoples in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the USA, of which a propo rtion of the studies were targeting the patients (contrary to health professionals) (60). adapted or modified selfmanagem ent programs (no specific diagn oses) for minor ity ethnic and Indigenous populations (62). interventions directed at immigr ant populations to improve heal th literacy, taking into account the role played by nurses (64). Many of these studies addressed health issues already discussed through the other sys tematic reviews, i.e. diabetes education, asthma education, can cer screening, or tobacco cessation information. Some additional health issues found in t hese reviews were car diovascular disease prevention or patient education (60, 62, 64 ), education for patients with respiratory infections (64), HIV/AIDS (64), arthritis (62) or chronic kidney dis ease (62), reproductive health information (64) and general hea lth literacy skills (64). 36 Discussion Discussion Key findings A substantial number of primary studies have addr essed the effe ct of adapted health information and patient education for immigrants or minority et hnic groups, summa rized in several systematic reviews. The studies of adapted dia betes education gener ally had intense interventions, with substantially increased in teraction with the health care services and additional re sources. Longterm blood sugar l evels improved some what among diabetes patients who received this. Studies of adap ted asthma education had interventions of relatively l ow intensity. The effect of ad apted education on risk of severe asthmatic exacerbations w ere limited or unclear. Studie s on adapted interven tions promoting cancer screening showed moderately higher atten dance at mammog raphy. These interventions often involved lay health workers an d contact on arenas outside the health sector. This overview of systematic revi ews shows that there are many s tudies on adapted health information and patient education regarding several heal th issues or diagnoses, including diabetes prevention an d smoking cessation. However, the available summa rised evidence from reviews did not describe the combined effec t sizes. Interventions characterised as a dapted health in formation and p atient education were generally complex programs, often including a substantial incre ase in the number of in teractions between the patients and the health services in the form of additional indi vidual or group teaching sessi ons, extra counselling, telephone support and outreach, and not only linguistic or direc t cultural adaptations. Thus, i t not possible to pinpoint the most important active interv ention components, nor their re lative importance. Confidence in the evidence of effect We only present results from sys tematic reviews of high methodo logical quality in this report. Even if a systematic rev iew is methodologically sound, the included primary studies may be of varying qualit y. A high quality systematic re view should have a thor ough literature search, clear i nclusion criteria, quality asses sment of the included stud ies and compiled additional inform ation about strengths and wea knesses in their im plementation (56). The GRADE assessments varied from high confidence in the pooled effect estimate, to very low confidence in the effec t estimate for different outcom es. To some extent, this variation corresponded with the quantity of available evidence, meaning evidence 37 Discussion based on many studies provided h igher certainty while fewer stu dies provided lower certainty. Lower certainty coul d also be due to unclear or ina dequate execution of the primary studies and small stud ies with few observations. It is important to underline tha t low confidence in the evidenc e of effect does not mean that the intervention is ineffective. The intervention may have an effect, but the availa ble evidence is too limited to estimate the effect sizes with a high degree of certainty. Strengths and limitations A strength of this report is the systematic and transparent met hods used to identify the available evidence. We have only included high quality systemat ic reviews published in 2012 or later, so this report represents an overview of the lat est summarized evidence for this topic area. Together wi th our previous memo (54), this can provide a basis for decisions about adapted health information and patient educatio n for immigrants or minority ethnic groups. A limitat ion of an overview of systemat ic overviews is that the analyses are based on already su mmarized knowledge. Results wil l be limited to the ev idence available in published sy stematic reviews, with the revi ew authors' notion of relevant populations, interventi on and control measures. We hav e not retrieved infor mation or data from any of the p rimary studies directly. This m eans that the quality of our report relies on review autho rs having retrie ved all releva nt information in a sensi ble manner. Although we considered the included reviews to be o f high methodological quality, there may be reporting errors or insufficient informat ion to get an indepth un derstanding of the evidence. A limitation to systematic reviews in general is that they may become outdated as soon as n ew studies are published. How generalizable are the results? The contexts and study populati ons in these systematic reviews varied considerably. Most of the included systematic reviews defined their study pop ulations as including both immigrants and minority ethnic groups, although the health related challenges faced by different groups might vary. The highest number of stu dies involved African Americans. African American and s everal Latin American groups h ave a long history of residency in USA. For immigrants , the migration process in itse lf, with relocation across borders and settlement in a new c ountry, can directly affect an individual's physical vulnerability to disease, mental health and social wellbeing. However, this is often de pendent on specific circumstances related to the motivation for migration (for instance war and conflict versu s other motivations) and the journey itse lf. Asylum seekers and refugees may therefore have different health challenges than ot her immigrant groups (82). Language problems and unfa miliarity with a new health car e system are also more common challenges for immigr ant groups compared to minorit y ethnic groups. The need for adaptation in general, and types of adaptations ne eded, may therefore be different for some immigrant grou ps. On the other hand, immigra nts and minority eth nic groups alike - also those with longterm ties to a country - may have other cultural preferences than the majority ethnic population. Cultural diffe rences can be related to various aspects, such as perceiv ed commitment to care for relat ives, preferences and 38 Discussion values for care options, food cul ture, religious or traditional beliefs and practices. Im migrants and minority ethnic groups may also differ from the ma jority ethnic popula tion in their ability to navigate structures of the society. More than half of the underlying studies in this overview of sy stematic review were from the USA, where the health services, although generally bei ng of high quality, are persistently less accessible to t he poor and other people who l ack health insurance (13). Review authors McCullum an d colleagues (72) comment that participants in the studies for USA generally lacked health insurance. Other revie w authors did not extract data on insurance status, but several remarked (59, 68, 69, 71) that most study popula tions had low socioeconomic statu s or marginal living condition s. The study popula tions may therefore be poorer and more socially vulnerable than most low socioeco nomic groups in Norway. The compa rison group in most studies re ceived as \"usual care\" or no intervention. Given t he low socioeconomic status of many participants, usual care may therefore range f rom almost no followup for a c hronic disease to regu lar followup by general practitioners. Although these studies mostly co me from contexts that are diffe rent from the Norwe gian health care and welfare sys tem, we still consider the find ings transferable to our defined study population. The de fined study population was \"Gro ups of people of for eign origin [...] who are believed to have specific health problems, limited health literacy skills, language problems or challenges related to optimal use of health care services in their resident country.\" Figure 2 illustrates the unde rlying assumption for this tran sfer ability. Figure 2: Illustration of how the comparison in this report can be interpreted. Patients from immigrant or minority ethnic groups who can make use of standard health in formation and patient educa tion in usual care and preventive health services. Patients from immigrant or m inority ethnic groups who \"un deruse\" standard health inform ation and patient education in usual care and preventive health services due to cultural, communicational, financial, practical or other barriers. The relevant comparison in this report Interventions with adapted health information and patient education in addition to usual care and preventive health services for patients from i mmigrant or minority ethnic groups in need of such measures. 39 Discussion Thus, we consider these results transferable to immigrant or mi nority ethnic groups \"underusing\" or having specific challenges regarding use of th e health care services, not all immigrants and minority ethnic groups per se. Attridge and colleagues (59) sta te that \u00abculturally appropriate health education is taken to mean any type of health education that has been specif ically tailored to the cul tural needs of a target minority group ...\u00bb. The other cited systematic reviews have simi lar definitions (68, 69, 71, 72). However, \"underuse\" or ineff icient use of the health care services may arise from sev eral factors. Many of the inclu ded studies in this over view had intervention components that are not strictly adhering to \"cultural needs\". Ex amples are making health informa tion more accessible by providi ng it in people's homes or on arenas outside the health care sector, or providing free access to mam mography services by mobile unit . Financial barriers is apparen t for uninsured patients in the USA, but also in welfare states like Norway outofpocke t fees or travel costs may hinder optimal use of services. People with low socioeconomic s tatus may find it diffi cult to attend patient education courses due to for instance sh ift work or lack of child care. Researchers in the field o f clinical epidemiology have wa rned that cultural factors may be exaggerated as explanati ons for ethnic inequalities in h ealth instead of raising attention to socioeconomic differ entials (for instance educatio n, income, wealth, hous ing conditions) and social disad vantage, including experiences of racism (10, 83). The outcomes reported in this review have different characteris tics and are of variable nature. Most of the reported out comes are risk factors or risk markers for disease, such as HbA1c for diabetes patients. While such outcomes may be view ed as \"surrogates\", i.e. not measuring clinically im portant outcomes such as morbid ity, they serve as objec tive measures of e ffect in these interventions. Implications for practice The evidence in this overview of systematic reviews summarizes the available research and indicates how much confidence we have in the estimates of e ffects. Different types of knowledge must be integrated i n order to offer evidencebase d health care services. These are: Best available research evidence. Experiencebased knowledge. User knowledge and user involvement. Knowledge about the context. Experiencebased knowledge from health professionals can be ski lls and assessment, communication and rela tionships developed t hrough clinical expe rience. User knowledge and user involvement m ay consist of knowledge, experi ences, values, wishes and needs of users, patients or relatives. The context i ncludes factors related to the geographic location, availab le resources, national legislat ion and guidelines. The evidence in this report covers health issues relevant to th e Norwegian context and, at least partly, relevant popula tion groups. An important findi ng is that the \"adapted health information\" and \"adapted patient education\" co nceal many different 40 Discussion adaptation strategies. Some inte rventions contained many activi ties and appear as complex programs for major lifes tyle changes. Other interventio ns include community campaigns or used outreach on arenas outside the health care se ctor. In many of the re views, it is unclear how the int erventions have been \"culturall y adapted\". These factors makes it difficult to conclude whether an effect is related to specific adap tations or whether the combined e fforts and overall intensity o f the interventions are essential, as also pointed out b y some review authors (69, 70). The intervention inten sity seems to be an important factor in itself. In particular adapted diabetes education, involved a substantial increase in the time and resources given to the participants. Some implications for practice are: Intense interventions with adapted health information and patie nt education seem to give measurable effects on selected health outcomes among vu lnerable immi grant or minority ethnic groups. Since most of the studies in the se systematic reviews contain a package of activities, the effect of single a ctivities cannot be anticipated based on these systematic re views, nor can we assume that some of the components are more i mportant than other elements. The research evidence regarding this subject still needs improv ement. When plan ning new interventions, decision makers and clinicians should e valuate the pro gram and document their findings to contribute to the knowledge base. Adapted health information and pa tient education may increase t he costs of care substantially. Aspects of costef fectiveness must be discussed both a local and na tional level. Need for further research It would be beneficial with furt her research regarding the foll owing topics/factors: Studies done in countries with d ifferent health care systems an d models of access to care, including more studies from Norway and other welfare s tates. Primary studies and systematic r eviews with adapted interventio ns for newly ar rived immigrants assessed separately from studies of longterm resident immi grants and minority ethnic groups. Studies comparing different type s of adaptations to identify th e most effective and crucial components. Studies that take into account a nd investigates the importance of cultural adapta tion relative to factors related to socioeconomic factors, marg inalisation and low health literacy levels among immigrant and minority ethnic grou ps. 41 Conclusion Conclusion It seems that intense interventions with adapted health informa tion and patient educa tion can improve health outcomes among vulnerable immigrant or minority ethnic groups. The evidence is most extensive for adapted diabetes edu cation. The available studies have generally focused on complex and often intense int erventions. We do not know which elements are most inf luential or necessary for achie ving the effects. 42 References 1. Folkehelseinstituttet. Helseti lstanden i Norge 2018. [Public Health in Norway 2018.
