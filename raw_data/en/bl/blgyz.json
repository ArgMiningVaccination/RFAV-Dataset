LEARNING OUTCOMES 2017 -18 Updates UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE OFFICE OF THE VICE CHANCELLOR, STUDENT AFFAIRS New Narratives Events CIVIC & COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT Students who participate in New Narratives events will develop a sense of local, national, and global responsibility . Measured By: Post survey of student opinions, beliefs Results: Follo wing three of the New Narratives events, post surveys asked students whether after the event they felt more empathy toward people facing many types of discrimination today. Students' rates of agreement or strong agreement that they felt more empathy were 9 2% at one event, 89% at another, and 92% at the third event (virtually all who did not agree were \"neutral\"). Responses after those same three events showed agreement that they were also now more eager to help people facing discrimination today. After the three events, 92%, 86%, and 75% of students reported agreement or strong agreement that they were now more eager to help those facing discrimination, while virtually all other respondents selected the \"neutral \" response . Use: Reporting Results New Na rratives Events DIVERSITY & GLOBAL CONSIOUSNESS Students who attend New Narratives events will broaden their perspective about people different from themselves . Measured By: Post survey of student opinions, belie fs Results: We were unable to assess this because the New Narratives events drew mostly students with the background as the focus of the particular event, e.g., Pilipinx or undocumented. However, our post -event survey did ask to what extent students learned more about the issues facing the particular group, even though the group was often themselves. At the Undocuqueer event, 69% agreed or strongly agreed that they had learned more about the issues facing undocuqueer students and 77% reported having learned more about the issues facing undoc umented students. At the event about Japanese internment camps during WWII, 93% of students agreed or strongly agreed that they had learned more about the camps and what Japanese in the US had faced. At the Pilipinx -American event, 91% either agreed or str ongly agreed that they had learned more about that group's experiences and struggles. One of our goals for the next year is to draw students with a wider variety of backgrounds to each event Use: Reporting Results New Narratives Events DIVERSITY & G LOBAL CONSIOUSNESS Students who participate in New Narratives events will develop more of a sense of their own beliefs and values . Measured By: Post survey pf student opinions, be liefs UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE OFFICE OF THE VICE CHANCELLOR, STUDENT AFFAIRS Results: This was only assessed following the last event of the year, the Pilipinx -American event. However, 88% of students agreed or strongly agreed that the event had made them think more about some of their own beliefs and values .

Measured By: Pre and Post surveys of student opinions, beliefs; interviews: one -on-one; student performance rated using rubric Results: We've impl emented three actionable feedback items: a physical check -in sheet and location to encourage more active customer service participation and awareness of Arena business/customer need ; an IT task force trained for more complicated troubleshooting tasks to re duce the need for OIT personnel or assist with their tasks ; and more physical notices and signs for important events, dates and operating changes within the Arena. We measured student performance and gathered feedback on the following areas: customer serv ice, communication, problem solving and technical troubleshooting. We removed project management when we realized most projects were owned by interns or full -time employees instead. We will explore future opportunities for more leadership roles within stud ent staff, but only 3 students expressed interest in pursuing additional roles and responsibilities. These percentages are rough due to some misplaced documentation (another focus for next year): Customer service: 100% improvement Problem solving: 100% im provement Technical troubleshooting: 70% improvement, 50% indicated they wanted to learn more Communication: 25% improvement UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE OFFICE OF THE VICE CHANCELLOR, STUDENT AFFAIRS We will be acting on feedback regarding more specialized training, including broadcast support (currently run by interns and volun teers) and event planning/execution. We will be creating more documentation to help with communication issues, including a streamlined SLO process and more clarity on updates on issues in the Arena. Returning students will be assisting with SLO modeling th is year as we continue with one -on-one interviews and group training sessions. We are also shifting some responsibilities onto supervisors from the Arena Coordinator role in response to upcoming structure changes within UCI Esports, including availability for all weekend operating hours. We continue to have 100% approval for the student staff role in the UCI Esports Arena, with each student expressing satisfaction with their role and our overall program, although two students are interested in getting mor e involved with improving program interactions with our student organizations Use: Providing feedback to student/participant; refining program/program changes; reporting results 2018 -19 New Narratives Events CIVIC & COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT Students who participate in New Narratives events will develop a sense of social responsibility .

HISTORY Student Center & Event Services is a result of the January 2009 merging of two departments: UCI Student Center and Scheduling & Conference Services. A history of each area follows. STUDENT CENTER Phase I of the UCI Student Center opened in January 1981 and contained approximately 31,000 assignable square feet (ASF). This initial phase provided space for the UCI Bookstore, lounges, games room, food service and offices. In 1982, Phase II was completed an d added 5,600 ASF for retail operations, as well as 4,000 ASF for multi - purpose meeting rooms. AUXILIARY SERVICES STUDENT CENTER & EVENT SER VICES Phase III expansion, completed in the Spring of 1990, added approximately 80,000 ASF to the original facility. Constructed at a cost of $24.5 million, Phase III extensively renovated the existing space and increased the overall UCI Student Center to nearly six times its previous size. The UCI Student Center currently comprises 114,000 ASF or 17 1,000 gross square feet (GSF). The 1990 expansion provided space for a new UCI Bookstore, extensive food se rvices, multiple meeting rooms, expanded offices, a variety of lounges, new retail space, a large auditorium and expanded space for the Cross -Cultural Center. During the 2001 spring quarter, the UCI Student Center boar d and the Student Center staff, in conjunction with the ASUCI elections, held a fee referendum to determine if the Student Center fee should be increased in order to expand the facility. The fee initiative was passed and the original fee of $47.50 a quarte r was voted to increase by $89.00 a quarter to be assessed w hen the addition was completed. This Phase IV expansion was completed in 2005. SCHEDULING & CONFERENCE SERVICES - 1997 This department was comprised of three critical scheduling and event plannin g departments that operated separately prior to 1997. The Student Center Reservations Office was responsible for event coordination and scheduling of all Student Center conference center space and its adjacent Ring Mall areas. Campus Calendar scheduled gen eral assignment classrooms and lecture hall spaces for non - academic events, as well as campus outdoor event space (Ring Mall, plazas, Mesa Field, Pelennor Field, Aldrich Park, etc.). Conference Services was responsible for scheduling and managing the summe r residential conference business. These three departments merged in 1996. With the three departments now combined into one, a comprehensive, one -stop events office was available for the campus community and off -campus clientele. Services include facility tours, booking space, planning, ordering services, writing contracts, managing events and billing . STUDENT CENTER & EVENT SERVICES - 2009 In order to gain additional efficiencies, Scheduling & Conference Services, Student Center, and a portion of Hospital ity & Dining Services merged and formed Student Center & Event Services . In addition to continuing to provide all the above, services have expanded to include better management of events in classroom and lecture hall locations by obtaining keys to most cam pus buildings and now managing the opening and securing of these offsite spaces booked by Student Center & Event Services. The staff created a vision statement and departmental values. A department logo and tagline were al so created. A \"level\" employment s ystem was implemented to ensure cross training and fluidity of knowledge among student staff. In addition, the operating hours of the Student Center were extended to 7am - 12 am, seven days a week, to offer more opportunities for our clientele to book even ts and use the Student Center's facilities and services . In 2013, the Newkirk Alumni Center opened and the responsibilities for booking for that facility and managing events were assumed by the team in Student Center & Event Services. In 2016, the Student Center Board and SCES sponsored a successful referendum to continue student fees that were set to expire in 2017. In the Spring 2016 election, the students voted to continue paying the fees. There was a 25% return t o aid added to this referendum. The Stude nt Center is now approximately 300,000 square feet. New services that have been brought to the Student Center since the opening of Phase IV include Housing Administrative Services, the Visitor Center, LGBT Resource Center, CARE, Veteran Services, the New U , Counseling Center Annex, the Center for Black Cultures, Resources & Research, and an expanded food service operation. AUXILIARY SERVICES STUDENT CENTER & EVENT SER VICES In Fall of 2017 , SCES added booking study space and two meeting rooms in ACRC to the inventory of spaces it books and manages.

ADVISORY COMMITTEE Student Center Board Chair Rutuja Sabnis Vice -Chair Mebin Kuriakose Secretary Leila Awad X. MAJOR ISSUES UCI Transportation and Distribution Services has provided many challenges including not establishing new fiscal year rates in a timely manner, billing inaccuracies, poor services and slow response times. These issues have forced SCES to reco nsider our partnership and subsequently our One -Stop Shop certification. Summer Conference Program faced several setbacks in housing availability, new construction and renovations, unexpected IT issues, parking and road closures, increased billing cycles, staff training and client agreements . Frequent large and last -minute change requests will require additional resources for managing this trend in customer expectations and demand . The number of requests for services at no charge or at a reduced rate and external departments ' demands for space . Lacking versatility in catering options for clients . Unclear campus policies for important event issues (alcohol, casino events). Center reaching capacity for conference and office space . Summer conferences rates remaining competitive with multiple departments influences and area hotels . Risk Management policy/procedure changes . Policy regulation . Campus partners changing rates with our advance notification . Implementation of a new Major Events policy . XI. MISCELLANEOUS Not applicable .

Measured By: Pre and Posttests of student knowledge; Checklist what rated using rubric; Interviews: one -on-one; Stud ent product (e.g., portfolio, journal), rated without rubric, Student performance rated without rubric . Results: SCES fully deployed its all -new Level Up Program, a program designed to track all student training and development activities for direct evi dence of learning. Whereas the program is quickly evolving into an entirely web -based training and learning management system due to deploy in 2018- 19, some encouraging results are now available that show a 175% better -than -expected participation in our pr ogram from a target of 75 students to 206 students (131 student increase). This is evidence of a systematic program with little to no gaps in organization -wide deployment. This will translate into a goal of 100% participation for all 200 -plus students in our workforce and all new hires in the year ahead. There were 206 students in our Leveling Up program with 67 students satisfying the requirements to move from L1 to L2. With each new level comes increased responsibility and autonomy. Each level consists of a checklist of all mandatory UCLC training, required reading, training, tutorials and quizzes. 100% of the 147 students onboarded on this year watched the SCES Approach to Quality Service training video and received the SCES Approach to Quality Service h andbook with first -attempt quiz scores averaging approximately 9 out of 10 and second and third attempts a perfect 10 out of 10. The SCES Approach to Quality Service covers competencies in the areas of our customer touch points; our four keys to quality se rvice; the SCES mission, vision and values; the Customer Compass; our main delivery channels; and our service recovery mentality. 39 of 67 new hires who participated in Operations' pre -training test demonstrated learning in key functions of L1 and L2 resp onsibilities with an average score of 57% increasing 24 points to 81% on their post -training test, which demonstrates learning in the areas of AV, customer service, radio communications and protocol, table skirting, venue locations and other key areas of O perations. The remaining 28 students who have not yet taken the posttest are scheduled to do so in the year ahead. Six students specializing in videography and photography services supported their film and media interests by identifying five portfolio piec es each for a total of 60 videos that directly evince business - ready competency in production and post production. The entire student workforce is assigned the Personality Code Assessment with instructions on interpersonal skills and self -awareness. This assessment was formerly completed on paper but has now transitioned online. In the year ahead, digital records of the Personality Code self -awareness assessment will be managed in Phase II of the Level Up program to ensure a systematic and consistent 100% completion by the entire student workforce with no gaps in deployment .

THOSE SERVED Student Government & Student Media serves the undergraduate and graduate student body, which is quite diverse. While the mission of Student Government & Student Media is to serve students, the organization welcomes involvement from faculty, staff and alumni, and makes great efforts to include them in its services and p rograms. AUXILIARY SERVICES STUDENT GOVERNMENT & STUDENT MEDIA V. HISTORY In 1965 -1966, over 50 students served on three committees (Honor Code, Constitution and Activities), which was the genesis of ASUCI. After a failed attempt to ratify a constitution in Spring 1966, on November 18, 1966, the first ASUCI Constitution and fee ($7 quarter) were approved with 74.6% affirmative vote of the 1,141 students who voted. Chancellor Daniel G. Aldrich recognized the election as valid and therefore authorized the establishment of both. On May 19, 1972, The Regents reaffir med that the Associated Students on the several campuses of the University are official units of the University \"exercising authorities concerning student affairs by delegations from The Regents, the President, and the Chancellors, and that the President c an continue to take all administrative action which is necessary or appropriate to treat the Associated Students and all of their activities as integral parts of the University, including, in particular, steps necessary to secure exemption from taxes on pr operty administered by ASUC's and from government permits and fees for their activities and actions to confirm that employees of the Associated Students are employees of the University.\" On October 8, 1972, The Regents authorized the ASUCI fee to increase to $8 per quarter. On February 14, 1973, The Regents authorized the ASUCI fee to increase to $9 per quarter. In 1981, The Regents authorized the fee to increase to $13 per quarter . And on July 18, 1996, The Regents authorized the fee to increase to $18 pe r quarter. In Fall 1976, the graduate students separated from ASUCI forming their own organization, Associated Graduate Students . Their current fee is $9 per student per quarter (excluding graduate business and medical students who pay $14 per student per quarter .) VI. LOCATION G-244 Student Center ZOT: 1375 VII.

ADVISORY COMMITTEE Anteater Express - Bus Love Advisory Board TGIF - TGIF Board X. MAJOR ISSUES Stud ent Government & Student Media realizes that in order to be the most effective at serving students during a tough budget time, we need to expand our full -time staff to ensure we have the time to devote to various student initiated projects and events. UC C ampuses , such as UC Berkeley , UC Santa Barbara and UCLA , receive hundreds more dollars per student, allowing them to offer more University -sponsored programs and services. UC Santa Barbara's Student Government (ASUCSB) has more than 23 full -time staff memb ers, which oversee a variety of functions including media, publications, programming advisement, technology, administration, business office, comm unity affairs and a bike shop. We operate many of the same programs with only 11 staff members that support AS UCI and AGS functions (not including Anteater Express and Student Media) , with many of those working dual positions for support . We hope to expand our services offered by Student Government so that UC Irvine students receive comparable student life experie nces as their peers at other UCs. We have seen a dramatic drop in support for our programs due to the economy and state financial support, which means ASUCI has had to subsidize programs that have traditionally been supported by campus partners . For examp le, Shocktoberfest was designed as a partnership between Student Housing, Student Affairs and Student Government to offer students an alcohol -free way to celebrate Halloween; however, we currently underwrite all of the costs for the program . The New Univer sity school newspaper has undergone a severe budget cut and now a loss of their referendum due to decreased revenue from on - and off -campus advertisers. Eight years ago, we laid off one position a nd eliminated three positions. Currently, we have one employ ee doing all of the advertising sales, invoicing, layout design and business office work, down from four employees seven years ago. The newspaper ran a referendum that did pass and this will assist in the printing operations of the newspaper . However, due to the sunsetting of the referendum and decreased revenue that can no longer support operational costs, on June 30, 2018 the New University will cease all print operations during its 50 th Anniversary year and transition to online. They will now run on a vo luntary, digital platform with any revenue from online advertising. The ASUCI Anteater Express program's costs have increased each year, which have resulted in the need for increased subsidies from campus departme nts who sponsor various routes: Transportat ion and Distribution Services, Undergraduate Housing, American Campus Communities, University Extension and the Registration Fee. However, we have seen many of these subsi dies decrease in recent years. The Anteater Express ran a referendum that was success fully passed, allowing for the purchase of a new fleet, which has been needed as well as assisting in additional costs. XI. MISCELLANEOUS None XII. 2017-18 ACCOMPLISHMENTS OVERALL DEPARTMENTAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS Completed all assessments for Student Learning Outcomes and will be compiling data for final review in the later part of 201 8 Met all budgetary obl igations and goals for the year AUXILIARY SERVICES STUDENT GOVERNMENT & STUDENT MEDIA STUDENT MEDIA KUCI successfully recruited and trained over 4 5 new student DJs, which allowed the station to replace community progr ams with student -facilitated programs. KUCI reached the $10,000 goal during Fall and Spring on- air fund drive. New University published 32 successful editions by providing a completely new layout as well as moving toward a digital operation. ASUCI Produced some of UC Irvine's most popular events - Welcome Week, Shocktoberfest, Homecoming, Soulstice and Summerlands with attendances at 5,000 students, staff and faculty per event and selling out the three major events Worked together with AGS on various lobbyi ng projects for continued student support towards a more transparent univer sity Held events every week of the academic quarter throughout all the Offices. AGS Successfully hosted the AGS Symposium with graduate students from various disciplines who were able to present their research to faculty and fellow students. Awards were given in various areas of research to these students. Doubled the number of events for grad students to socialize, network and work together on to build their various communities. ANTEATER EXPRESS Provided over two million passenger t rips to the UC Irvine community Completed construction on the new home of Anteater Express in Lot 36 Received a fleet of brand -new, all -electric buses, paid and supported by students PARTNERSHIPS ASUCI cur rently administrates all Dean of Students funding boards, including the Multicultural Programs Funding Board, Dean's Fund and Community Service Funding Boards. ASUCI has partnered with Athletics and UCI Dining to host several major rallies through the yea r to support var ious men's and women's sports. Events have resulted in several record -high attendances (over 1,000) for Men's Basketball in the previous years. ASUCI partnered with the UCI Alumni Association to jointly plan Homecoming each year, and contri butes toward its entertainment cost of the outdoor festival each year. This annual week -long award -winning program was created to energize the campus with spirit for UCI Athletics. Housing and ASUCI have merged Welcome Week plans to focus our students on c ampus involvement. Major events inc lude the Welcome Week concert, Screen on the Green (movie), Open House, UCI Give Back and a shopping shuttle. Shocktoberfest is a Fall celebration for undergraduate UCI students. This event has gone through a number of it erations through the years , but the consistent intention has been the creation of a vanguard student life program to foster a sense of community. In its most recent format, Shocktoberfest partnered with Athletics' Midnight Magic program to kick off the UCI Basketball season and serve as a catalyst for campus spirit. This event is a true campus collaboration, planned by a campus -wide committee with over 20 representa tives from various departments.

All completed this task. In the Winter Quarter 2018, the teams were asked to reflect on their fall quarter essay and note (1) if they have noticed a particular aspect of their leadership skills that they feel they need to improve or see as a challenge and (2) how they plan to improve that skill and turn the challenge into an opportunity. All students felt they had a challenge to their skills and gave a way they felt they could improve and/or tackle that challenge. In the Spring Quarter 2018, the teams reflected on their essays from the two previous quarters, drawing specifically on (1) would they still assess themselves as the leader they felt they were in Fall Quarter 2017 and (2) were they able to improve on the skills they felt they needed to and if so, what were the results and if not, how do they plan to do so in the future. All students felt they had grown since the Fall Quarter and had made positive adjustments to their skills that helped them build a leadership style unique to them.

HISTORY MESA COURT Mesa Court is a Residence Hall that house d roughly 2,900 freshman students in 2017 -18. Mesa Court Unit I was the first residential community to be built on the UCI campus. It opened in the fall of 1965 with 8 residence halls that housed 400 undergraduate students, plus eight Resident Advisors (one in each hall). In the fall of 1966, Mesa Court Unit 1A opened with 2 residential hall buildings adding 100 add itional bed spaces at 50 beds per building. With 500 students residing in Mesa Court, the Dining Commons was opened for business in 1966. As the enrollment continued to increase on the campus Mesa Court also continued to expand. In 1967 Mesa Court opened U nit 2 providing 5 residence halls with 60 beds and one Resident Assistant suite per building. Three years later in the Fall of 1970, Mesa Court Unit 3 opened with 8 residence halls, 4 with 41 beds per building and 4 with 59 beds per building for a total o f 400 beds and 8 RA suites. With the rapid expansion from its opening in 1965 up to 1970, Mesa Court increased its capacity to 1,200 beds and had 23 Resident Assistants. The community remained at this capacity for the next 32 years until 2002 when Mesa Cou rt completed Unit IV. This project provided 10 residence halls for a total of 610 bed spaces on lower Mesa replacing 4 of the Unit 3 buildings and adding a net increase of 524 bed spaces to the community. There was also a major remodeling of the Mesa Commons Dining facility and the addition of a Community Center in 2002. Although Mesa Court's design capacity was to house 1,728 students, growing enrollment has led to increased tripling of rooms and conversion of some study rooms, so that Mesa Court classic h alls now house 1,947 students (plus 29 RAs). During 2016- 17, the Mesa Court Towers Expansion opened, adding 932 bed spaces to the community; it was awarded LEED Platinum for sustainable practices in design and construction . MIDDLE EARTH The Middle Earth r esidence hall community houses first year students in 24 halls all named for places and characters from J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. The first phase of Middle Earth opened in Fall, 1974 and included 7 residential buildings, Brandywine Dining Commons , recreational/study/ AUXILIARY SERVICES STUDENT HOUSING meeting spaces and administrative space. Each building houses 49 students and one Resident Assistant. In 1989, Middle Earth II opened an additional 13 halls providing 935 additional bed spaces, Pippin Dining Commons and new administra tive and community space. The third phase of Middle Earth was completed in Fall, 2000 and provided four additional halls adding 280 additional beds. This brought the predominantly freshman complex to a capacity total of 1,565. After closing in the summer o f 1989 when the new Pippin Dining Commons opened, Brandywine Dining Commons re - opened in Fall 2001 as a second dining venue in Middle Earth. Like Mesa Court, Middle Earth has increased its bed spaces in recent years to accommodate larger freshman classes, and in recent years has housed 1,769 first year students (plus 24 RAs) . During 2016- 17, UC Regents approved plans for a Middle Earth Expansion project that will add 474 bed spaces to that community. The project broke ground in June 2017 and is scheduled to open in Fall 2019. CAMPUS VILLAGE Opening in 1980, Campus Village consists of 200 ap artments housing 788 students. Each apartment houses four students sharing two bedrooms, a kitchen, a living/dining area and either a balcony or a patio. The community houses sophomore, juniors, seniors and transfer students and has also served as ' overflow' housing for freshmen. No freshmen were housed in Campus Village in 2012 - 13, but there w ere 300 freshmen assigned to the community for 2013 -14. In 2011 -12 a decision was taken to convert Campus Village to graduate housing over a four- year period, beginning in summer 2012. Ninety -six graduate spaces were created in 2012 -13; however, the next phase of the conver sion has been put on hold since that time in order to manage undergraduate enrollment increases . ARROYO VISTA Opening in 1993, Arroyo Vista s tarted with 35 residential houses (and has since grown to 42 houses) that accommodate 16, 24 or 32 students. Houses are clustered into groupings of two or four houses. The community houses 1,034 students, predominantly sophomores, juniors and seniors, thou gh it also serves as 'overflow' housing for freshmen when needed. In 2002, an $11M litigation settlement was received for construction defects in the complex. The community offers both academic theme sponsored houses (28) and Greek chapter sponsored houses (14). In 2012-13, AV implemented a new staffing model, placing live-in Resident Advisors in half of its houses (as opposed to every house as it previously did) . Over the years, some of the theme sponsors change, based on demand and the availability of fac ulty and staff to participate in theme programs. Some theme houses added in recent years include Academic Excellence - Black Scholars House, La Casa Nuestra (Spanish immersion house), Religious Studies, Lambda Sigma Gamma (multi -cultural sorority), and the Dreamers House (supporting undocumented students). VERANO PLACE Verano Place was constructed in five phases, the first phase opened in 1966 and the other phases in 1967, 1976, 1984 and 2012. There are 852 one, two and three bedroom apartments (two house maintenance staff) that house up to 1,221 students (some with families). The community houses graduate students, married undergraduates, single undergraduates with children and single undergraduates who are 25 years or older. In 2012, Verano completed const ruction of its latest phase of apartments, replacing those added in 1976. This construction project also included a new Infant Toddler Center that w ill serve the UCI community. P reschool and afterschool program s are also located in the community. Verano Pl ace also has two community centers, children's playgrounds, a Cyber Cafe and a community garden. AUXILIARY SERVICES STUDENT HOUSING PALO VERDE Palo Verde was constructed in two phases, opening in 1989 with 204 apartments (320 bed spaces) and adding an additional 448 apartments in 2005 for a current total of 652 apartments and 1,071 spaces. The community offers studios, one, two and three bedroom apartments for graduate students and older (or married/with families) undergraduates. The community offers meeting space for group events, children' s playgrounds and an organic garden . LAS LOMAS FACULTY & STAFF APARTMENTS Opening in fall 1982, Las Lomas provides 100 two and three bedroom apartments for faculty, staff and guests of the campus. While part of the UCHS system, the apartments are managed b y the Irvine Community Housing Authority (ICHA) . AMERICAN CAMPUS COMMUNITIES (ACC) ACC is a third -party develop ment located on the UCI campus. It currently has 4 properties including Vista Del Campo, Vista del Campo Norte, Cami no del Sol and Puerta del Sol . Vista del Campo Phase I opened in 2004 with 488 (1, 2, 3 and 4 BR) furnished apartments housing 1,488 students. Vista del Campo was nationally recognized in 2005 by the NAHB Pillars of the Industry as the Best Student Housing Community. Vista del Campo N orte was completed in 2006 and has a design capacity of 1,564 bed spaces. Camino del Sol and Puerta del Sol opened in fall 2010, serving 1,198 and 880 students respectively. In recent years, a portion of the ACC apartments originally targeted to serve grad uate students have converted to undergraduate spaces, responding to the corresponding demand among students . In total, ACC provides the campus with 5,142 student beds, many of which are used to support housing guarantees to targeted student populations. VI.

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS Clery Act - Requires that the university maintain a \"statement of current campus policies regarding the immediate emergency response and evacua tion procedures, including the use of electron ic and cellular communication.\" The campus Emergency Services Manager has identified a need for each department on campus to maintain and emergency action plan to meet this requirement . Higher Education Opportu nity Act - Campus Fire Sa fety Right -to-Know Act (2008): Campuses must publicly provide for each on -campus student housing facility o Quantity of fires and causes; number of injuries and deaths related to fires; and the value of property damage caused by fire s o Descriptions of each facility's fire safety systems o Quantity of mandatory, supervised fire drills o Policies on portable electronic appliances; smoking and open flames; evacuation procedures; fire safety education and training programs provided to students , faculty and staff o Plans for future fire safety improvements, if needed o Annual report to the campus community California Code of Regulations : Title 19 e stablishes minimum standards for the prevention of fire and protection of life and property aga inst fire, explosion and panic. It governs use and maintenanc e of any state- owned building. This is accomplished through a crew of 4 Fire Prevention Officers administered by the Campus Fire Marshal and assigned exclusively to Student Housing. This team operates u nder a Memorandum of Understanding, which was amended in September 2015 to add specific reference to Title 8 - General Safety Provisions and Title 24 - Construction (maintenance to comply with original construction requirements). California Health and Safe ty Code Section 13108 allows the State Fire Marshall and their authorized representatives to make fire prevention inspections in state -owned buildings for the purpose of enforcing regulations related to fire and panic safety.

MAJOR ISSUES CAPITAL PLANNING Redevelopment of Existing Gradu ate Apartments The oldest remaining buildings in Verano Place were constructed 50 -years ago (Units 1, 2 and 3). Renovations have been accomplished through routine and major maintenance renovations. These efforts focus on addressing deferred maintenance but can only provide limited modernization. The scale and volume of these renovations are approaching the financial threshold whereby a longer-term investment in new construction may be advisable. Units 1, 2 and 3 are also the remaining facilities with configurations that best serve needs of familie s with children, which must be considered in redevelopment planning. Freshmen Residence Hall Capacity Increasing capacity to house first -year residents is critical to meeting the current housing guarantee. This has partially been addressed with the Mesa Co urt Expansion, however the projected demand will not be fully met. Additionally, approximately 490 current freshmen are not in a residence hall environment that is best to support student success. A comprehensive housing plan is required to address this ga p in freshmen residence hall demand. Facility Modernization and Upgrades Major Maintenance efforts have focused on critical repairs and establishing a consistent level of maintenance throughout the p ortfolio of Housing facilities. Vital initiatives have be completed, as generalized in the following categories: \u00a7 Fire Safety - Significant investments have been made to complete upgrades in fire alarm systems in existing buildings , even if not required by Code. In September 2014, the Campus Ethics and Compliance Committee reviewed the status of work completed thus far. Certain areas of Student Housing had been previously deemed as High Risk, but this exposure was reduced based upon review. \u00a7 Wireless - Client expectations for wireless access increases each year, as evidenced by annual surveys where wireless in the dorms is the most requested service. Installation in undergraduate housing was completed for the 2015 -16 academic year. \u00a7 Roof Replacements - Approximately 250 buildings within the Student Housing portfolio have roof systems within the life cycle of industry standards. Ongoing maintenance will be within predictable and acceptable levels. Redevelopment of Existing Residential Dining Facilities Existing facilities do not support modern food service and dining m odels, are inefficient to maintain and are not adequately sized to accommodate the growth in campus -wide enrollment. This condition has been addressed in Mesa Court with development of the Mesa Court Expansion, but not in Middle Earth with Pippin / Brandyw ine Commons resulting in a dissimilar experience between residents of the two freshmen housing communities. SUSTAINABILITY In November 2013, President Janet Napolitano announced the Carbon Neutrality Initiative , which commits UC to emitting net zero gree nhouse gases. Student Housing has completed significant improvements to increase water and energy efficiency of facilities and is now embracing its unique AUXILIARY SERVICES STUDENT HOUSING access to the campus community. The broad goal is increasing environmental sustainability through education and agency of residents and employees throughout the department, collectively serving as change agents that fost er healthy environments, social justice and economic viability. o Based upon the American College Personnel Association monograph \" Towards A Sustainable Future ,\" Housing leadership created a Vision for Sustainable Living in Student Housing. o A Sustainability Program Manager has been recruited with responsibility for development of programs and a department wide sustainability ag enda; research and benchmarking; and marketing, training and communications. o The department has made efforts to expand its impact by focusing on education and behavior change, specifically by engaging its diverse professional staff, a workforce of over 225 p eople. The department also expanded its sustainability co -curricular programming and internship oppor tunities for student residents. Additionally, key campus partnerships were strengthened, such as with Facilities Management to increase zero waste efforts, and the Global Sustainability Resource Center to further sustainability goals and planning . MANAGING HOUSING GUARANTEES WITH GROWING ENROLLMENT Growth in both undergraduate and graduate enrollment has exerted increased demands on Student Housing, challe nging our ability to meet obligations associated with the freshman housing guarantee. Residence halls that were formerly able to accommodate the freshman have in recent years been outpaced by growing freshman class sizes. Repurposing spaces in other on-cam pus communities has protected the first -year guarantee but reduced the housing stock available to continuing students. In 201 6-17 , in addition to the 932 beds that were added in Mesa Towers , roughly 503 freshmen were housed in t wo alternate undergraduate housing communities (Arroyo Vista and Campus Village). In fall 201 7, an additional 152 beds will be added to the residence halls and roughly 340 beds in Arroyo Vista and Campus Village will be used to accommodate growing freshmen enrollment. Growth in inte rnational student enrollment has increased demands for year -round housing, a special orientation program (ISO) the week before move-in, early fall move-in and winter break housing. In fall 201 6 995 international students attended ISO and moved into their fall assignments t wo days early. An additional 67 Edge students (who did not attend ISO) moved into their fall spaces early as well . Graduate enrollment has grown more gradually, and demand for available on-campus housing cont inues to be concentrated in UCI -owned communities due to their relatively low rental rates. Pressure to contain housing costs remains an active issue among graduate students and led to the decision to convert Campus Village Apartments from undergraduate to graduate housing over a four year period beginning in 2012-13. Ninety -six graduate students currently live in Campus Village ; however, continuation of the conversion remain s on pause due to a greater need for beds on the undergraduate side (particularly with first year students). XI. MISCELLANEOUS Not applicable AUXILIARY SERVICES STUDENT HOUSING XII. 2017-18 ACCOMPLISHMENTS FACILITIES Streamlined the process and reduced costs of tree maintenan ce services with a single, strategically -sourced vendor, which was awarded to West Coast Arborist. Utilized technology to support tree risk assessment, scheduling and communication. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT & STAFF TRAINING The Residential Community Wellne ss Strategic Plan Initiative Committee provided a 5 -session staff training program focused on personal well -being and how to respond in emergencies. RESIDENT RELATIONS & CUSTOMER SERVICE Summer 2017 Management of Freshman Enrollment Surge: Worked with Adm issions, Student Affairs, the team led by the Chancellor's Office and Housing Communities to meet housing guarantees, communicate effectively with students and parents, manage the Anteater Leadership Academy (ALA) launch, and provide a welcoming experience to all. This involved virtually daily collaboration with campus partners to keep people updated, track logistical steps being taken to add beds, maintain consistent messaging and ensure public relations in a time of high stress and exposure. We participat ed in planning to add beds, modify room configurations in OSCAR and get all spaces assigned to meet guarantees. A sub-project within this achievement was managing ALA students \u2014assisting that program in developing off -campus housing options and overseeing a process for providing them with a second year of guaranteed housing (like other FR). Despite huge challenges, we met our guaranteed housing obligation! Successful implementation of the expanded Transfer guarantee to include all domestic status and age gro ups. Developed new process, coordinated space planning with GFH and ACC and met the guarantee for 150+ non -traditional applicants (including 20+ students with children). Developed improved tools for students to offer and find on -campus sublets, in response to a request from student groups (ASUCI. AGS). Developed specs for website enhancements and worked with Off Campus Partners to update screen options and filters on the Anteater Housing Network (AHN). We also developed a new webpage on the Housing Website to explain how to use the AHN to list and find on campus sublets. Enhancements have been released and the site is already showing activity. Enhancements to the Housing Tours webpage. Due to ME Towers construction, we lost our tour room this year. In respon se, we significantly enhanced online resources for viewing residence hall rooms and community facilities, adding many high quality photos and a video for each RH community. The video was produced with direct student involvement and the page analytics since launch have been impressive. This was a real team effort that drew upon Corey and Callie's technical abilities. Developed new Spanish -language resources for parents of incoming students, in line with UCI becoming a Hispanic -Serving Institution. Expanding upon the Spanish- language housing presentation and tours at yield and orientation events, we created Spanish versions of selected web pages most relevant to parents of incoming students, including pages listed under the \"Apply\" tab, along with the \"Payment Info\" page. We also created a Spanish language version of two Housin g videos for incoming students \u2014 the \"Apply for Housing\" and \"Paying for Housing\" videos on the UCI Housing YouTube channel. AUXILIARY SERVICES STUDENT HOUSING FINANCIAL Strategic Financial Planning & Budgeting Developed p roficient, flexible strategic plan that has adapted to changing requirements and constraints while keeping rate increases at a minimum and achieving benchmarks and targets. Successfully led budget development process to address fiscal/operational needs across Student Housing and incorporated a solicitation of unit challenges from Housing Management Teams in order to increase BAC's awareness and involvement in unit's fiscal and staffing challenges. Partnerships Sustained positive partnerships with key campu s partners via the Student Housing Budget Advisory Committee, including stakeholders such as Fiscal & Accounting Services, Planning & Budget Office, and Capital Planning. Developed partnerships with the SIS/Banner Project Team to facilitate data collection and business process mapping. Staff Development & Training Conducted several equity comp studies throughout the year to identify staff in comparable positions/classifications that may require equity increase. Created training opportunities through working with the Interim Campus Controller to facilitate Housing -specific Fiscal Close Workshop for our financial and business managers. Conducted budget process training for AGS and ASUCI student leadership teams to build understanding and foster advocacy in support of Student Housing's proactive fiduciary achievements in maintaining minimal rate increases. Participated in training and provided detailed information to the Whitebirch financial consultants in support of developing Student Affairs financial modelin g system. PARTNERSHIPS Housing Information Technology Completed the implementation of DUO two -factor authentication on the virtualized servers. Completed the installation of the ResNet network infrastructure switch refresh project. Shifted to the OIT stan dardized remote support tool, Bomgar and eliminated the need for Dameware. Completed the establishment of a Housing Utility Network and completed the move of the MC EAC solution to this network.

At the Fall quarter Casino Night program RHA collected toys from attendees that were later donated to the Irvine Marine's 2/11 Adoption Committee for the holidays. At the winter quarter Drive Out Hunger program RHA collected over 203 new hygiene products and raised $645.00 dollars to dona te to Mary's Kitchen they collected at the program from residents in all 4 undergraduate communities and the ACC properties. RHA revised the Of The Month (OTM) nomination process for recognition to reflect the national process and format. By doing this, R HA is using a national recognition model and has increased their nominations of professional staff and residents from the previous years. An additional Student Development Coordinator was proposed and approved this year to work with RHA. The RHA program h as grown the past few years and the need for additional focus on their growth and development was imperative. The new position/additional staff member was presented and proposed to the undergraduate Associate Directors of Residence Life team, Director team , Senior Leadership Team, Executive Director and then the Budget Advisory Committee. AUXILIARY SERVICES STUDENT HOUSING Arroyo Vista Successfully completed kitchen renovations of 10 houses to improve student housing experience through upgraded appliances and more functional facilities an d equipment to service the small community style living arrangements of Arroyo Vista. Incorporated LARC Classes for our residents to enhance our positive educational impact on our living learning communities and grew our partnership with ASUCI to further i mprove the ASUCI Garden at Arroyo Vista. Increased our number of academic/themed partnerships by adding Physics, Outdoor Adventure and Second Marco Antonio Firebaugh House, providing students with new living learning spaces to enhance their academic experi ence at UCI. Campus Village In order to improve the service provided to our residents, this past year Campus Village made a number of much needed improvements to our Convenience Store operations. These improvements included providing sales receipts to our customers when they purchase items in our C -Store, as well as the reorganize our C -Store's store room. Instead of leaving everything on the floor or stacking them, we installed four (4) large adjustable shelf units which allows us to fit all of our sales i tems on the shelves. This has given us a great way to keep in track our inventory, along with maintaining better control of the C - store front desk while getting items from the store room. Our biggest accomplishment this past year has been building strong c ollaborations across the University for the betterment of our students. From the summary below, we have worked with all types of offices to make excellent programs happen for our students. We have collaborated weekly with Student Wellness and Health promot ion to do a weekly cooking class. We have collaborated with the CCC to put the Black Panther program on. We have collaborated with other units to bring SWANK on to campus at affordable rates. We have collaborated with the Career Center to do a career week. We have collaborated with off campus folks to provide various experiences for our students including Geek Day and the Life Sciences tour. We continue to collaborate with Rachel and with the Transfer Resource Center to strengthen our learning communities. We even were able to collaborate with the GSRC and RHA to put on large scale events in CV that would normally not be held here. All these collaborations have helped our students have quality experiences and have resulted in a tight knit community who is ex cited to attend programs and even go on to work for us. Mesa Court To assist the university in meeting the first -year student housing demands, Mesa Court added 150 new beds by converting all tower rooms to quads and converting some existing double rooms t o triple rooms. This was a coordinated effort by our residence life, operations and administrative teams. Mesa Court added 3 new theme halls to its portfolio. The Guild is connected to the Esports Club and focuses on the interpersonal aspects of video gam ing. The Globe is sponsored by the International Center and focuses on the integration of international students and the interest of students who wish to study abroad. The Sustainability Hall is connected to the Housing Sustainability program and focuses o n behavior changes that support more ecologically sensitive lifestyles. AUXILIARY SERVICES STUDENT HOUSING Mesa Court replaced an existing deteriorating fire road during the academic year. This road is a vital thoroughfare for the community. Mesa Court wanted to test the ability to do majo r maintenance projects while students were in residence to expand the timeframe in which projects could be completed. The project was successfully completed with minimal impact on the community and provided Mesa Court with valuable best practices for commu nication to residents and dissemination of information to the community. Middle Earth Middle Earth Residential Life staff planned ahead to lessen the impact of the construction of the Middle Earth Expansion on the seven halls directly adjacent to construc tion by purchasing fans for each room and creating mitigation packets for each resident consisting of ear plugs, earbuds (several different kinds), sleep masks and dust cloths. Additionally, dust cloths and ear plugs were available to the entire community through the front desk in the main office and the Tolkien recreation room. Pathways where foot traffic were congested were extended by creating DG walkways. Additional programs were planned for the seven halls directly affected by the construction to help mitigate the impact as well as several all community programs. Middle Earth Operations staff continued their bi -weekly safety tailgates where a different aspect of creating a safe work place was emphasized such as Ladder Safety and Heat Illness Prevention . Guest presenters helped the team focus on ways to work safely and efficiently while making the sessions interactive an d fun! These safety sessions have earned Middle Earth recognition as a model department for safety planning and training from EH&S. In collaboration with Aramark, Middle Earth created a To -Go Cup to go with the To -Go Box. This increased the sustainability of the program by eliminating single -use cups and gave residents a way to easily transport hot or cold beverages out of the dining hall when they're eating on the run. Middle Earth also purchased recycling bins with small attached trash cans for each resident room to encourage recycling and to create the visual impact that we should be recycling more than we are sending to landfills. Wit h promotion, education, programs and effort, Middle Earth worked with their first- year residents and increased their landfill diversion rate by 33% from the previous academic year! Palo Verde Palo Verde Housing enhanced the condition of the property throu gh performing maintenance to address trip and fall hazards on walkways, planting 50 new trees, adding a second community garden, replacing flooring in laundry rooms and updating the kitchen, flooring and fixtures in the community clubhouse. Student Housing worked with AGS and the Graduate and Family Residents Councils to expand the Anteater Housing Network, a website designed to provide easy access to off - campus housing and roommate listings, to also be accessible as a platform for on -campus residents to us e when they need to advertise and recruit for summer sub -tenants. Graduate and Family Housing demonstrated teamwork and service orientation in responding to the growing size of the incoming graduate student class. The communities met all Guarantee commitme nts during Summer 2017. During Fall 2017 and Winter 2018, the communities worked to strengthen resident knowledge and understanding of the renewal process to improve transparency and reduce surprises. AUXILIARY SERVICES STUDENT HOUSING Graduate and Family Housing hired and on -boarded a Cas e Worker. The Case Worker worked directly with students facing financial struggles and housing insecurity to identify resources and develop an action plan. Verano Place Verano Place completed six major maintenance projects which resulted in significant structure improvements of four different sections of the community, as well as other community improvements. XIII. 2018-19 GOALS STUDENT HOUSING STRATEGIC PLAN A Staff Engagement initiative team will lead department staff through a series of activities designed to strengthen engagement. These activities will be part of the departmental goal of Building Community. In order to assess the current departmental climate and identify opportunities for enhancement of the program, Student Housing will complete a Program Revi ew through the 2018 -2019 academic year. An external review team will be assembled to assist in the process of prioritizing enhancements and opportunities for improvement with the goal of providing a first in class experience to our residents. The addition of 480 Residence Hall beds and 1,400 ACC beds in Fall 2019 coupled with very modest enrollment growth calls for a new approach to occupancy planning. The Campus Village conversion of spaces from undergrad to grad is scheduled to resume for fall 2019 as wel l. Responses to these changes will include shifts in how we promote housing to Freshmen, Transfers and Continuing Students. Most notably we will likely be offering students the opportunity to remain in the residence halls for a second year. Planning will b egin in early fall 2018 in order to include a Residence Hall option in the Continuing Student Process (2 -yr Guarantee application in November). FACILITIES Advance campus aspirations for growth through completion of construction of the Middle Earth Housing Expansion, with anticipated opening in fall 2019. Build resilient communities with landscape environments that can thrive in the natural climate of the Irvine area. Create pleasant surroundings that are resistant to disease and pests without reliance on artificial water, fertilizer and herbicide treatments. Use plant material that are appealing in their natural state, requiring little labor or fuel to maintain. Build resilient communities that are able to efficiently assign keys and nimbly manage access to sustain security. Deploy department -wide retrofit of standard card key access systems in existing buildings. PARTNERSHIPS In collaboration with colleagues, develop requirements that support the integration of the Housing OSCAR system with t he campus' trans ition to Banner . RESIDENT RELATIONS & CUSTOMER SERVICE Enhance online resources to replace in -person tours during non -peak months (to make up for the loss of our housing tour room) AUXILIARY SERVICES STUDENT HOUSING Incorporate case management position into graduate and family housing to ad dress increases in resident relations activity FINANCIAL Develop flexible long -range financial models that reinforce housing's stewardship of resources initiative, addressing operational needs, capital project plans and external obligations . Create annual budget guidelines and lead the departmental annual budget development process, including establishing long -range and short -term rate caps as well as net revenue targets for each housing unit to assist directors and managers in developing their unit's annua l budgets . XIV. AWARDS None XV. LEARNING OUTCOMES 2017- 18 Updates ARROYO VISTA Resident Academic Success PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY In an effort to help Arroyo Vista residents increase their personal responsibility (as it pertains to their academic success), the Arr oyo Vista Residence Life team will work collaboratively with UCI's Learning and Academic Resource Center on increasing AV Residents' use of LARC's tutorial sessions.

Number of FTEs has only increased by 2. o Increasing demand to provide guidance to RCOs engaging in high -risk events, which requires additional educat ion and one -on-one advisement. A few examples include RCOs working with minors, RCOs taking off campus trips, RCOs working in partnership with off campus entities for events and a continual education about liability insurance. o Increasing demand to monitor RCOs campus demonstrations, which requires staff support to create a saf e space for RCO members and make certain they understand policy. o Signers for RCOs do not recall imperative information from their online orientation to become an authorized signer such as trademark restrictions, venue reservation protocols, financial oblig ations and liability insurance. As a result, additional education is needed to over 600 leaders. o Increasing demand for RCOs to abide by the temporary food permit program and Student Center and Event Services venue protocols, which require additional guidan ce and attention. o Emerging situations regarding student advocacy. Recently, students raised issues around how the campus educates student lea ders about cultural competency. In addition, an issue of risk management and liability involves dance crews pra cticing in parking structures. Additional advocacy and education work need to be developed to educate student leaders. o Effectively incorporating Volunteer Program, including programs, services, staff and students. 10 211 2716 7 024681012141618 UC Berkeley UC Irvine UC Los AngelesUC Merced UC Riverside UC San DiegoUC Santa BarbaraRCO FTE for Peer UniversitiesSTUDENT LIFE & LEADERSHIP CAMPUS ORGANIZATIONS & VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS Space: RCOs require storage space for their organization items like tables, chairs, banner, canopies, etc. Limited funding resources: A majority (about 95%) of Campus Organizations' operating budget is collected from campus organization registration fees ($50/club/year), which includes budgets for major events (Anteater Involvement Fair, Fall Leadership Conference, Winter Leadership Conference, Anteater Awards), supplies and expenses, workshops/ presentations, technology needs , etc. Income from the registration fee will also be reduced this year due t o ASUCI' s new charge for club accounts.

Measured By: Post surveys of student opinions and beliefs Results: Post surveys for Alternative Break participants indicated an increase in knowledge of specific social issues based on service site, however they did not record the number of community issues students could recall. Instead, students expressed a deeper understanding of community needs and social responsibility through oral presentation/reflection of their experience (reorientation). Although feedback was positiv e, the turnout for reorientation was low. Based on this result, Alternative Break will increase service opportunities to include weekend service projects and incorporate reflection/post service feedback at the end of each program .

BUDGET Consolidated into the operating budg et for Student Life & Leadership. STUDENT LIFE & LEADERSHIP CENTER FOR BLACK CULTURES, RESOURCES & RESEARCH I. VISION & MISSION VISION Guiding Vision and Ethos The vision of the Center for Black Cultures, Resources & Research (CBCRR) is anchored in the notion of perpetually working towards the greatest good for the greatest num ber of students, faculty and staff of African ancestry, advanced in the interest of building a just, safe, vibrant, inclusive and socio -ecologically sustainable campus experience. It is a vision that draws its guiding inspirations from the very best Africa n deep thinking and doing that Black peopled have engaged in across the millennia, on both sides of Atlantic and throughout the African diaspora in contact and conversation with their realities. It is informed by the varied and complex constellations of Af rican/Black cultures that have provided and continue to provide African/Black peoples with general designs for living and patters for interpreting their reality. Our guiding ethos is Ubuntu (\"human -ness \"). Ubuntu is a Nguni Bantu term that speaks to the notion that there is a universal bond of that connects all African (Black) humanity and that there is a common humanity that unites all peoples everywhere. Understood in this way, Ubuntu suggests that a plurality of perspectives, united in common purpose can develop a forceful and productive synergy that elevates the greater collective good. Our be lief is that unity does not require uniformity but it does require principled collaboration, and that the combined impact of principled collaboration is greater than the sum of individual disparate efforts, however well intended, and that this purposeful s ynergy has the ability to have a positive impact upon UCI campus community at large. Our vision of collective work and responsibility twinned with collaborative problem solving is captured best by in our motto: Unity without Uniformity . MISSION The mission and work of the Center for Black Cultures, Resources & Research (CBCRR) is to create a home away from home for Black students, faculty and staff at UC Irvine; to bolster and when necessary restore and rebuild a vi brant Black community on campus; to provid e Black students from various walks of Black life and cultural experiences a place to center themselves within their cultural realities. We recognize that communities of all kinds, whether workplace, educational, military installations, neighborhoods or fa milies have a vitality that is predicated on a constellation of relationships that are, in part, resource dependent. We understand that the buoyancy and vibrancy of any community rests on a delicate balance between the identification and development of res ources and effective management and efficacious allocation and uses of those resources. Communities are, in a certain regard, organisms with often complex and intricate social ecologies made up of various peoples with shared and differing (and at times div ergent) interests and multiple nodes of interconnections and interactions as do the institutions (formal and informal) that they inhabit and whom serve them. And those peoples and the various institutions they interact with most immediately and directly im pact their development at every level. Universities are no different in this regard. University communities are, most importantly, about the people that inhabit them - their identity, heritage and values, their hopes, aspirations and desires, their loves, their sense of connectedness and their sense of belonging, and as such they are also about cu lture and context. They are buoyed by a sense of growth and dynamism and informed by environmental events as well as socio -historical circumstances shape community cultures in ways that increase life opportunities or delimit them. STUDENT LIFE & LEADERSHIP CENTER FOR BLACK CULTURES, RESOURCES & RESEARCH Our goal as a center is to work collaboratively with various university -community stakeholders to reimagine and rebuild Black communal spaces that are vibrant, safe and socio -ecologically sustainable by identifying underutilized community resources, developing resources or repurposing extant resources, while placing the development and growth of the most salient resource in our community - the people - at the forefront of our work . The Pill ars of Service Ankh (Vitality): to work individually and collectively to improve the overall quality of Black student life on campus. Uja (Prosperity): to help to enrich the quality of Black community life and the overall campus life experience. Seneb (He alth): to work towards the overall health and vitality of Black students, faculty and staff, to extend those benefits to the health and vitality of the communities they inhabit and the overall health and vitality of the campus ecology. Maat (Balance): to work as center towards what is just and good, to instill harmony and reciprocity, to seek balance. CORE COMPETENCIES TBD II.

BUDGET Follows on next page STUDENT LIFE & LEADERSHIP CENTER FOR STUDENT LEADERSHIP I. VISION & MISSION VISION Not available MISSION The mission of the Center for Student Leadership (CSL) is to provide all UCI students with the necessary skills and opportunities to engage the campus and the broader world as authentic and transformational leaders. The CSL se rves as a hub for student leadership by connecting students with opportunities to develop as leaders and practically apply their leadership skills throughout the university. The CSL is firmly rooted in the value of social justice and trains students not to simply manage the world as it is, but to envision what it might be and boldly pursue positive social and institutional change both on campus and beyond. This deep engagement with the transformative power of leadership begins with orientation and continues through graduation. Values Social Justice At the CSL, we believe leadership is not simply about managing the world as it is, but envisioning what it might be. We recognize that we inhabit a deeply imperfect world in which many people are oppressed and we work to support our students in becoming agents of positive social change. Authenticity The CSL is committed to the idea that truly transformational leadership is possible when it is aligned with students' core values and when it comes from the strength to be honest about who we are, what we believe and what we want the world to be. Vulnerability At the CSL we believe that when we face our pain we begin to heal, when we are open about our faults, we begin to grow, when we name our fears, we begin to o vercome them. And in having the courage to be vulnerable, we give others space to do the same. Mentorship The CSL values mentorship, particularly peer mentorship, as a powerful tool for personal and interpersonal support and development and for cultural a nd social change. Innovation Leadership calls for innovative problem solving, so the CSL is dedicated to helping students find new ways to approach their work as leaders on this campus and beyond. Empowerment We at the CSL have the utmost faith in the b rilliance of students and center the empowerment of students and student voices at the core of everything we do. Connection At the CSL we believe that when we face our pain we begin to heal, when we are open about our faults, we begin to grow, when we na me our fears, we begin to overcome them. And in having the courage to be vulnerable, we give others space to do the same. STUDENT LIFE & LEADERSHIP CENTER FOR STUDENT LEADERSHIP Social Responsibility As leaders, we are called to be stewards of our world and to lead in ways that respect and preserve our planet and enhance our social communities. The CSL is dedicated to socially responsible leadership.

THOSE SERVED Students, staff, parents/guardians and alumni V. HISTORY New Student Programs began in 1980 with the creation of two jobs (staffing the Aldrich Hall Information Booth). New Student Programs was a part of Student Support Services under the direction of Bob Gentry. As change occurred on the campus, New Student Programs moved (along with the Dean of Students) into the old Student Activities Office and the name was changed to the Office of the Dean of Students to cover New St udent Programs, Student Activities and the location of the Dean. In the winter of 2012 the Office of the Dean of Students officially became Student Life & Leadership. In 2014 New Student Programs and Leadership Programs merged to become New Student and Lea dership Programs. In 2018, New Student & Leadership Programs re -branded to become the Center for Student Leadership and moved to the Anteater Community Resource Center. VI. LOCATION Center for Student Leadership is located in the Anteater Community Resource Ce nter (ACRC). Student coordinators and the Administrative Intern work out of shared student space also in the Student Center G308. VII. ASSETS Major facilities, technologies and equipment FACILITIES Not available TECHNOLOGY Over the years, Center for Student Lea dership has built and refined its own online registration system for Summer Orientation. STUDENT LIFE & LEADERSHIP CENTER FOR STUDENT LEADERSHIP EQUIPMENT Set of 10 two -way radios and chargers VIII. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS Assembly Bill 1088 requires that the campus provide information to all new students on Sexual A ssault and Intimate Violence. This information is included in the Student Parent Orientation Program for new freshmen in a session led by Wellness, Health and Counseling Services, through peer led activities led by the peer education groups in CARE (CHAMPS , Right to kNOw and Violence Intervention Program), through a resource fair for incoming students and families that features CARE and through an optional workshop on bystander intervention to prevent sexual violence based on the Green Dot violence preventi on model. In addition, 100% of our student and professional staff have been trained through the violence prevention program, Green Dot. For a full list of Student Affairs mandates, please refer to the Appendix. IX. ADVISORY COMMITTEE Orientation relies on good collaboration with many areas on campus. Currently the Academic Counseling Directors and the Director of New Student Programs meet quarterly to discuss the academic sections of orientation. In addition, there is a yearly committee of representatives from the Office of Admissions & Relations with Schools (OARS), Office of the Registrar, Financial Aid, Athletics, Campuswide Honors Program (CHP), Academic Schools and Academic Testing Center that advise New Student Programs on issues and ideas for Orientation. X. MAJOR ISSUES 1. Keeping orientation financially accessible for students and parents is growing increasingly difficult as the costs of running the program continue to increase and the needs of our students grow as well. 2. We would like to do more to engage alum ni, especially after the wildly successful SPOP 50th Anniversary Reunion, but we do not have the staff resources to pull off our ambitious plans at this time. 3. We are already outgrowing our new space in the ACRC. Depending on future plans for the building and priorities of the division, CSL expansion to a third ACRC pod could help to alleviate the constraints and position us to achieve our goals. 4. As our team grows, the demands upon us and scope of programming has also continued to grow, so we never seem to catch up to a reasonable workload. 5. The schedule for CSL is grueling. Summers, which for most areas of the campus are a downtime, are our busiest time and we never have a downtime any other time of year either. Major programming begins for the academic year the day after our last orientation program ends and doesn't slow down until we get right back to orientation again the following summer. This will be mediated in part by the temporary contract position we have been granted, though the timing of the approv al means we will not be able to start training the new person until just before the academic year starts anyway. We need a more permanent solution to the problem as it is impacting the mental and physical health of the staff and limiting our ability to achieve the potential of the Center. XI.

V. HISTORY The Cross -Cultural Center (CCC) was founded on October 16, 1974, by a group of concerned UCI faculty, staff and students who recognized the need fo r creating a social -cultural support system for ethnic minority students. The CCC was the first mul ticultural center at a University of California campus . The stated purpose of the center was \"to create Third World interaction, student outreach and provide necessary information to the minority community on campus.\" The first director was Dr. Larry Onoda, a psychologist from the Counseling Center. The CCC was housed in an 1,800 square foot temporary building located across Ring Mall from the School of Humani ties. The original facility consisted of a reception area, a director's office, several student offices and a conference room separated from the reception area by an accordion -style partition. Under the direction of one full time staff, and in par tnership with students, faculty and staff, the 'Cross ' as it affectionately came to be known, embarked upon a series of programs, activities and services to support the emerging needs of UCI's growing underr epresented student population. In 1976, the Cross -Cultur al Center dedicated the first of several murals that would become synonymous with the facility. The first mural, designed and painted by UCI students, was developed under the direction of Manuel Hernandez, a visiting lecturer in Studio Art. It depicts p rominent historical figures who were voices for equality and justice. It also portrays significant events in the annals of California's mino rity communities. Changing demographics and campus growth necessitated the expansion and relocation of the Cross - Cultu ral Center. After considerable campus debate about the sit ing of the new c enter, it was determined that the new Cross -Cultural Center would be located on Ring Mall across from the Administration Bu ilding. On April 18, 1989, the new Cross -Cultural Cent er op ened its doors to the UCI c ommunity. The present facilit y is 3,400 square feet and consists of a lounge, administrative offices, student offices, small library, student workroom and two conference rooms divided by a moveable partition. The original mural, dedicated in 1976, was moved to the new facility and is prominently displayed in the lounge. In 1993, a mural conceived by the well -known muralist, Judy Baca, was installed in the 'Cross' conference room. Commissioned by the National Institute of Mental He alth for the National Conference on Refugee Services and undertaken as a mural class project by UCI students, this mural depicts the silent suffering of Asian/Vietnamese and Latino/Central American refugee communities. In the spring of 1991, concerned stu dent organizations within the Cross -Cultural Center established the Ethnic Students Coalition Against Prejudicial Education (E.S.C.A.P.E.). The goal of E.S.C.A.P.E. was to push for the implementation of ethnic studies programs at UCI. All of the student um brella organizations unified in this effort and they sponsored several major rallies to generate campus support. In 1993, As ian American students held a 35 -day rotational hunger strike in an effort to secure more facult y for the Asian American studies program as well as an additional staff member for the Cross -Cultural Center. This extended and peaceful protest received considerable media attention and galvanized the Asian American community. In July 1999, Corina Espinoza departed UCI for a position at Cal ifornia State University, Bakersfield. Corina STUDENT LIFE & LEADERSHIP CROSS -CULTURAL CENTER had served fifteen years in various staff positions in the CCC, nine as Director. After serving as acting director, Anna K. Gonzalez became d irector of the Cross -Cultural Center in 2000. In 2008, Anna departed UCI for a position as Associate Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs and Director of the Office for Inclusion and Intercultural Relations at the University of Illinois at Urbana -Champaign . Kevin Huie served as the directo r of the Cross- Cultural Center until the summer of 2015. In December 2015, Jade K. Agua, assumed the role of Director until May 2018 and left for an opportunity to join the USC Race & Equity Center. In May 2018, Marcela Ramirez -Stapleton joined the Cross- Cultural Center as Interim Director. There are now five student umbrella organizations recognized by the Cross -Cultural Center; Black Student Union ( Indian (APSA) and Movimiento Estudiantil C hicano de Aztlan (MEChA). The number of individual organizations under these five umbrellas is in excess of 50. As it has since its establishment in 1974, the CCC continues to provide many students a home away from home. And, for many, it remains a \"safe and brave space\" from which students may launch their involvement in myriad campus programs and leadership opportunities. In response to the growth of underrepresented populations and the overal l diversity of the campus, the Cross has evolved and expanded its programming to address the issues and perspectives relative to these changes. At its core, the CCC endeavors to promote the education and celebration of a multicultural sensibility as we continue through the millennium . VI.

MAJOR ISSUES FACILITY MAINTENANCE AND UPGRADES STUDENT LIFE & LEADERSHIP CROSS -CULTURAL CENTER Even though the referendum was passed to support the Student Center and the Cross -Cultural Center, basic facilities maintenance and once -anticipated upgrades (i.e., upgraded A/V and technology, replacement of damaged furniture) continue to be a challenge to implement . Not having an explicit yearly budget for facility upgrades and maintenance of the Cross -Cultural Center makes it difficult to keep t he building optimally functional . LACK OF A STRATEGIC DIVERSITY PLAN With the Center for Black Cultures, Resources & Research, Womxn's Hub, DREAM Center and other identity -based centers on the horizon (i.e., Latinx Resource Center), the Cross -Cultural Cent er could be better poised and positioned to develop at least a Student Affairs -wide strategic diversity plan . Efforts could be strategically aligned and amplified rather than duplicated . XI. MISCELLANEOUS None XII. 2017-18 ACCOMPLISHMENTS Additional facilities upgrades include new flooring in the Dr. White Room. We also had 2 ,709 total room reservations made by Registered Campus Organizations, community partners and campus departments. Supported a record number of affiliated Registered Campus Organizations (72) and continued to make changes to how the Cross -Cultural Center engages with and supports affiliates through the implementation of the Quarterly Affiliates Challenge, which provided $500 in funding to student organizations. The popular REAL Talk program, which offers a weekly meeting space for the campus community to engage in critical conversations, had 404 participants. A total of 29 sessions occurred and yielded 14 participants on average in attendance. Our Faculty -in-Residence program featured two faculty m embers from the School of Law during fall and winter quarters: Jennifer Chacon and Annie Lai. Hosted three Field Study Interns across winter and spring quarters which resulted the following: an analysis of facilities usage and recommendations from students , research on affiliation requirements to support student organizations at other colleges and universities and developing an infrastructure to support requests from K -16 institutions for tours of the Cross -Cultural Center. Revamped procedures and guidelines for the Multicultural Programs Funding Committee to ensure that the information was transparent, consistent and accessible to student organizations. Nearly $5,000 in funding was awarded. Organized 25+ tours of the Cross -Cultural Center to K -16 institutio ns due to high demand. Continued to use social media to engage the broader campus community and especially students, which resulted in getting over 900 followers on Instagram and over 2,800 followers on Facebook . XIII. 2018-19 GOALS Strengthen programming in the areas of academic excellence and career development to support student success and facilitate holistic student development. Develop more robust Faculty -in-Residence Program and create intentional partnerships with faculty of color across campus. Enhance C ounselor -in-Residence Program through additional wellness and mental health programming. Make structural changes to Volunteer Program that results in increased student engagement with the Cross -Cultural Center's program areas and interactions with interns.STUDENT LIFE & LEADERSHIP CROSS -CULTURAL CENTER Continue to provide facilities enhancements and upgrades through installation of security cameras for the building, A/V equipment for the Ring Room and improved A/V equipment for the Dr. White Room. With the Womxn's Hub back in the Cross -Cultural Center d uring the 2018 -2019 academic year, we will look to identify opportunities to create strategic partnerships and collaborative programming to support our students. Bring speakers of national influence and high visibility for the Cross- Cultural Center's signa ture programs (i.e., Martin Luther King Jr. Symposium, Deconstruction Zone). XIV.

VISION & MISSION VISION The UCI DREAM Center is an innovative leader in supporting the unique needs of undocumented students. We empower students to graduate and successfully pursue their dreams. MISSION The DREAM Center is dedicated to serving the AB540 and undocumented student population through advocacy, guidance and support. The programs and services are designed for students to achieve academic, personal and professional excellence. CORE COMP ETENCIES The DREAM Center utilizes expertise in the areas of student development; student counseling and advising; and immigration law and policy in order to advance our mission of student success. Specifically, these areas of expertise allow us to holisti cally serve students through the formulation of programs and services that meet the needs of undocumented students at each step of their university experience. We also utilize our expertise in the current state of immigration law and policy to act as an in -house resource to other departments of the University as they encounter issues connected to undocumented students.

III. SERV ICES PROVIDED Legal Support and Referrals In partnership with the UC Immigrant Legal Services Center, we provide legal representation to students and their immediate family members in any immigration related issue. Student Consultations Students can make a one -on-one appointment to discuss any issue that may be impacting their lives. We often advise and counsel students on issues connected to financial aid, academic success and STUDENT LIFE & LEADERSHIP DREAM CENTER professional development. Often, undocumented students can feel isolated on ca mpus and can be reluctant to reveal their status. For these students, the ability to discuss personal or academic issues in a safe environment and with professionals that understand the nuances of their situation is priceless. Housing Assistance We co -sponsor two dreamer themed houses, specifically for undocumented students seeking a supportive living environment. We also facilitate the relocation of students struggling to afford their assigned housing plan to more affordable options on campus. Dream S cholars This retention program is designed for first -year undocumented students to thrive and excel in a safe and receptive environment. The main goals are for students to develop personal responsibility, build a social network, participate in professional development and receive academic support. The program consists of attendi ng a weekly seminar and receiving a peer mentor . Dream Scholars Plus Similar to Dream Scholars, this retention program is designed for undocumented students to thrive beyond their first year. Through the program, s tudent participants receive personalized attention and additional academic resources such as GRE scholarships, books and free printing. Community Alliance Internship This internship allows participant s to increase their knowledge of immigrant rights and issues, actively advocate for the advancement of undocumented immigrants and participate in professional development seminars. The student participants also learn about research and graduate school preparation. DREAM Inc ubator This program provides the necessary leadership skills, administrative skills and professional development to allow participants to successfully and responsibly engage in entrepreneurship . The course provides undocumented anteaters with an opportuni ty to utilize their unique skills and talents in the realm of business. Participants learn through workshops, visits to community businesses, mentorship and utilization of campus resources to support student entrepreneurship. Scholars in Residence This pr ogram, in collaboration with Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) and Academic Affairs, is intended to provide mentorship to undergraduate students w ho would like to learn about graduate school. The program pairs undocumented graduate students with undocumented undergrad students to develop pathways to professional or graduate school Support Group The UndocuEaters Support Group was established in partnership with the UCI Counseling Center to provide support for undocumented students and other individuals directly impacted by immigration policies, including students who have family, friends, or partners who are undocumented. The support group provides a space for students to build a support system, discuss current issues and receive support from professional counselors. UndocuArt Collective Undocumented Students have the opportunity to come in and work on art as a form of self-expression and de -stressing. The program provides students with a chance to be creative and use their artistic skills to express themselves. Students have been able to bond and form friendships that extend outside the STUDENT LIFE & LEADERSHIP DREAM CENTER DREAM Center . With a strong membership and commitment, participants have found healing and community through art. IV.

HISTORY The UCI DREAM Center was created in Augus t of 2017. The Center was an expansion of the previously existing Dreamers Resource Program of the Student Outreach and Retention Center. The expansion of this program into a full -fledged, stand -alone Center was thanks to the dedication and leadership of undocumented student advocates, committed staff and faculty members and funding for University of California Office of the President (UCOP). The creation of the DREAM Center was also a result of the continuing, multi -year growth of UCI's undocumented studen t population, which is currently the largest within the UC system. VI.

MAJOR ISSUES There are three primary challenges looming for our program in 2018 -2019. First, uncertaint y regarding the future of DACA and the increasing number of non -DACA students means that we must develop more programs and resources to meet the unique needs of this particularly vulnerable group. Given the sometimes myopic focus on DACA and DACA recipient s, a shift in the discussion regarding non -DACA students must occur. Second, sustaining our services and financial aid resources as our UCOP grant comes to an end in 2019 presents a significant challenge. We are confident that the campus will find a way t o continue the crucial work of the DREAM Center, but we recognize that developing a plan for funding will require internal conversations amongst stakeholders and continued advocacy. Finally, many of the students we serve have lived in a state of near cons tant fear and anxiety since the presidential campaign of 2016. This stress and fear have taken its toll on the mental, emotional and physical health of many of our students. We must meet their needs and provide practical services that support health and he aling. The UCI DREAM Center will continue to focus on health and wellbeing in our programming in the coming year. XI. MISCELLANEOUS Not Applicable XII. 2017 -18 ACCOMPLISHMENTS Financial Aid Resources This year saw important expansions of financial aid resources a vailable to undocumented students. First, in partnership with the Division of Undergraduate Education, the UCI DREAM Center was able to offer LARC scholarships of $110 a piece to the 89 students that participated in our DREAM Scholars and DREAM Scholars Pl us retention/academic success programs. This year was also the first year of our Scholars -in-Residence Program. This program recruited four undocumented graduate students to act as mentors for undocumented undergrad students interested in grad school. Eac h graduate Scholar -in-Residence received a $4,000 scholarship in recognition of their work and the funding for these scholarships came from contributions from various schools throughout campus. Another noteworthy expansion of financial aid resources came in the form of a scholarship fund created by our UCI Police Department. This year the DREAM Center provided free DACA renewal services to a record number of students. Fortunately, the vast majority of these students had their renewal fees covered through outside funding sources. However, 16 of these students needed to complete Live Scan fingerprinting as part of their renewal process and this fee was not covered by outside grants. Each Live Scan costs $45 so our campus Police Department raised over $400 th rough officer donations, in order to offer scholarships to those students unable to pay the fingerprinting fee. In addition to these new financial resources there was also innovation in existing resources. In prior years, our Office of Financial Aid and S cholarships offered a scholarship for non -DACAmented students. However, the message we have received from our non -DACAmented students is that professional development opportunities are a critical unmet need on par with financial support. In response to thi s feedback, the UCI DREAM Center, in partnership with the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships, created a professional development internship program and redirected the funds used for the previous non- DACA scholarship to a stipend awarded to participan ts in the internship program. Thus, student participants received both financial assistance as well as crucial professional development opportunities. This new program saw $89,000 distributed to 23 students. STUDENT LIFE & LEADERSHIP DREAM CENTER Legal Assistance Legal assistance is one of the most impactful services that we are able to offer our students and their families and there is always tremendous demand. In fact, demand for legal services this past year was so significant that the campus staff attorney had to stop new intakes for a peri od of several months during the academic year. In order to meet this increasing demand, the UCI DREAM Center met with Song Richardson, Dean of UCI Law School, in February to discuss our serious need for additional legal capacity. Dean Richardson was very receptive to our request and committed to providing us with a paid law fellow starting in Fall 2018. This law fellow will be a recent graduate of UCI law, will double our capacity to serve students and will continue to strengthen our relationship with UCI law. We are thrilled about this partnership and the tremendous benefit it offers to our students and their families. Programming Innovations in DREAM Center programming this year have been driven by student needs and input. As noted above, one of the mos t urgent requests we have heard from students is a need for professional development opportunities that do not require a social security number. We met this need through the creation of three unique programs to address professional development. First, we created our Community Alliance Internship, which provided substantive professional develop ment support along with a $4,000 stipend for each of the 23 participants. For entrepreneurial students, we launched the DREAM Incubator, a credited course that was c o- developed with UCI Law and which taught students the fundamentals of how to work as independent contractor or business owners, regardless of immigration status. Finally, we created Scholars -in-Residence, a program designed to help undocumented undergrad s become competitive applicants for grad school through mentoring, application guidance and exposure to research opportunities. I addition to these exciting new programs, we also redesigned our first -year retention program, DREAM Scholars. This year we pa rtnered with an academic unit, Student Success Initiatives (SSI), to co -facilitate DREAM Scholars. SSI brought their expertise in academic counseling and support and we focused on identity formation and community development. This revised course was a trem endous success and has shown promising impacts on the retention and academic success of participants. New DREAM Center 2017- 2018 was our first year in our new physical home. Previously, the DREAM program was limited to one small office in our Cross -Cultur al Center. We are now in our own, dedicated space which is comprised of six staff offices, two consultation rooms, student coordinator workspace, a student lounge, kitchenette facilities and multi -purpose space with AV capabilities . This space has been a great success for us as it has allowed us to serve far more students and it has created a sense of community and safety for undocumented students. The lounge area of the space is open for students until 10:00 p.m. and we love seeing that it is almost alway s filled with students late into the evening. XIII. 2018-19 GOALS Reformatting Community Alliance Internship to allow for experiential learning placements outside of the DREAM Center Increased programming related to health and wellbeing Creation and funding o f a scholarship for undocumented students attending UCDC program STUDENT LIFE & LEADERSHIP DREAM CENTER Increased fundraising efforts and cultivating relationships with private and institutional donors XIV.

THOSE SERVED The FRESH Basic Needs Hub serves undergraduate and graduate students facing basic needs insecurities. We serve students from a variety of backgrounds and grade levels. V. HISTORY Early Beginnings Talks of a food pantry have been floating around campus since 2011, when a group of graduate students briefly opened a pantry at Verano Housing after feeling the effects of food insecurity, or the condition of having limited and inconsistent access to nutritious meals. However, because re sources were limited, the pantry was unsustainable and had to be closed and the idea of a food pantry was tabled indefinitely. In Spring of 2014, however, conversations surrounding a food pantry began resurfacing when students were campaigning to fund the Student Outreach and Retention Center (SOAR) during the Spring Elections. One of the campaign's promises was to open a food pantry at SOAR if the referendum passed. Coincidentally, during that same year, conversations about food insecurity were buzzing at the UC Office of the President. The student -regent at the time, Sadia Saifuddin, advocated for a food security subcommittee to be a part of the larger Global Flood Initiative (GFI), a large project that utilizes research, outreach and policy to solve some of the world's pressing hunger problems. For the 2014 -2015 school year, GFI created a fellowship program to address hunger solutions and three students from UCI (Alexander Fung, Jennifer Lima and Jessica Figueroa) were awarded one of that year's fellowshi ps for the UCI campus. To fulfill SOAR's promise of opening a food pantry, the three fellows focused their fellowship project on the possibility of establishing a food pantry on campus. Through their research and their collaboration with the Muslim Studen t Union (who was able to secure a $2500 grant to open a pantry on campus from a third -party organization), the fellows decided that the best course of action was to hold a food security awareness week to make the UCI community aware of the prevalence and e ffects of food insecurity on campus. During that week, the fellows created a petition asking for the establishment of a food pantry on campus and were able to collect 1000 signatures to deliver to UCI's administration. At the same time, UC President Janet Napolitano approved a grant proposal that provided a one -time allocation of $75,000 for each of the 9 UC campuses to address food insecurity. UCI leadership and the newly established Food Access & Security Workgroup, after these successive events, approve d the establishment of a food pantry at SOAR at the end of the 2014 -2015 academic school year. To promote the food pantry and continued STUDENT LIFE & LEADERSHIP FRESH BASIC NEEDS HUB raising awareness about food insecurity, ASUCI (UCI's student government) established the Food Security Commission throu gh the office of the student Vice President of Administrative Affairs. Pantry Launch: 2015 -2016 Academic Year With the $75,000 funding from GFI and the $2500 grant -money that MSU acquired, SOAR was poised to begin tackling food insecurity at the beginn ing of the 15 -16 academic year. As such, through the combined efforts of SOAR, the ASUCI Food Security Commission and dozens of student leaders and volunteers, three main achievements were accomplished during this academic year. 1. Food Pantry Establishment & Hiring of Full -Time Coordinator in Fall of 2015 a. On October 5th, 2015, the SOAR Food Pantry was officially established and opened with a grand -opening ceremony. The pantry served non -perishable food items that were purchased from the OC Food Bank, such as pasta, mashed potatoes, granola bars, cereals, etc. b. A few days before the opening of the Pantry, SOAR hired Andrea Gutierrez, a UCI Alumna, to be the full -time Food Security & Access Coordinator to run the pantry, develop programming and come up with s olutions to tackle food insecurity on the UCI campus. c. The Food Pantry was visited often during the first year of its opening. It served 2,949 students total and had 655 unique student visits from both undergraduate and graduate students. 2. UCI hosted the 2 nd annual California Higher Education Food Summit (CHEFS) in Winter of 2016 The annual conference, which brought in 230 attendees from the UC, Cal State and Community College systems, helped UCI further understand food insecurity issues (causal factors and solutions) and see what techniques other campuses were using to address this problem on their own campuses. 3. Passing of the Food Pantry Initiative in Spring of 2016 Students successfully campaigned for and passed the \"Food Pantry initiative\", a student fee referendum that allocates $3 quarterly in student fees from every undergraduate student. This fee would provide an approximate of $150,000, after return to financial aid, for the next ten years to expand food security efforts at UCI. The referendum passed with 85.80% approval from the student body. Continued Expansion: 2016 -2017 Academic Year With the increased funding, some of the goals for the 16 -17 school year included tackling the various challenges we faced last year, as well as increasing the amoun t of services and programming we offered. We were also able to hire 2 student staff with the increased funding. Our 3 main accomplishments for the year included: The Securement of a Bigger Space Student Affairs allocated a portion of the Lot 5 trailers to serve as a new space for the pantry and other programming. Once the space was ready made available, the space was fully renovated and built out to serve the multiple functions of the Basic Needs Hub. A student contest for the name and logo of the new spac e was held and the space was named the FRESH Basic Needs Hub based on the winning submission Free Monthly Farmers Markets To truly tackle food insecurity and make sure that students had access to nutritiously - dense food, SOAR hosted a monthly free farmers market to distribute fresh food on campus in collaboration with Second Harvest Food Bank 7 farmer's markets were held and 2,666 unique students received food, with 4,682 total attendees for the year Launching of the Smart Eaters Life Skills Series STUDENT LIFE & LEADERSHIP FRESH BASIC NEEDS HUB A col laboration between SOAR and the UCI's Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion Workshops addressed several factors that lead to food insecurity and taught students basic life skills, such as nutrition, meal planning, grocery shopping, eating well on a budget, financial basics, cooking and kitchen safety The students received lots of giveaways and free lunch during the workshops and a total of 198 students participated in the series This year, because of the increased funds and increased student famil iarity with the Pantry, the food pantry was visited almost 3X as much as last year, with a total of 9,954 frequent visits and 2,898 of those being unique visits. We also had 3954 students on the Food Pantry list -serve and almost 600 Facebook page likes. FRESH Basic Needs Hub Opening: 2017 -2018 Academic Year On September 27, 2017 the FRESH Basic Needs Hub hosted its grand opening with over 500 individuals in attendance. With this bigger space, we were able to offer a larger variety and larger quantity of f ood so that we could serve more students, distribute fresh fruits and vegetables through our refrigeration systems, have office space for the expanded professional and student staff team and have an area to increase the volume of programming offered. In it s inaugural year, the pantry at the FRESH Basic Needs Hub was visited 14,926 times with 3,243 unique students. As we shifted from food security to basic needs security, our goals encompass total student well -being. To this end, the Emergency Meal Swipe Pro gram was expanded to include graduate students, and an Emergency Grant was created to support students in higher need. Due to the increased visibility and campus awareness of this new resource, we were able to collaborate with multiple campus departments a nd community organizations to host tours and visits, create fundraising campaigns and coordinate food drives. Establishing a basic needs center on campus, where existing staff and services are centrally coordinated has helped us achieve greater impact and efficiency. Student visiting the hub may pick up emergency food and toiletries; visit and talk with other students; prepare food in a kitchenette complete with blenders, a convection oven, a microwave and a coffee machine; participate in the Smart 'Eaters Life Skills Series which gives students the education and skills they need to eat healthy on a budget and to learn how to cook affordable, nutrient- dense foods for themselves; and get involved by volunteering in the Hub. In April 2018, the FRESH Basic Nee ds Hub became its own unit under Student Life and Leadership creating new and exciting opportunities to connect and participate in more aspects of student life. VI.

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS Not Applicable IX. ADVISORY COMMITTEE Not Applicable X. MAJOR ISSUES Only 1 FTE to oversee the entire facility, student team, programs and collaborations As increased awareness of the pantry at FRESH grows, food demand also has grown and our partners at Second Harvest Food Bank and OC Food Bank are not able to provide the quantity of food we need. This has resulted in an increase of spending in supplementary food purchased to keep the pantry stocked. Having access to pursue corporate partnerships or sponsorships will be needed to maintain the pantry in the coming years. Significant decrea se of grant funding from Office of the President and the State's Hunger Free Act funding will potentially impact our ability to serve students beyond the 2018 -2019 academic year. XI. MISCELLANEOUS XII. 2017 -2018 ACCOMPLISHMENTS September 27th Grand Opening with o ver 500 individuals in attendance and news coverage in the LA Times, UCI News, OC Register, LAist and Food & Wine.

LEARNING OUTCOMES 2017- 18 Update s SOAR Food Pantry Volunteer Program PROFESSIONAL & ADMINSTRATIVE SKILLS Pantry volunteers in the SOAR's Pantry Volunteer Program will increase their kno wledge of food security challenges in higher education, as well as services and resources offered at the SOAR's FRESH Basic Needs Hub and will be able to give an oral presentation to introduce individuals to the campus services after completing a quarterly volunteer program . Measured By: Pre and Posttests of student knowledge; Checklist of what student(s) did; Student performance (e.g., student oral presentation) rated using rubric; Interviews: one -on-one; Student product (e.g., portfolio, journal) without rubric; Student performance (e.g., student oral presentation) rated without rubric . Results: Student participants in the volunteer program increased their knowledge of food insecurity in the college campus by 80% while partici pating as volunteers. Most student participants started with zero to little knowledge about college food insecurity and while participating they learned how to define food insecurity, as well as to name its factors and prevalence in the UC system. Most importantly, they were able to learn how to explain resources offered on campus by the FRESH Basic STUDENT LIFE & LEADERSHIP FRESH BASIC NEEDS HUB Needs Hub to student clients of the hub and how to successfully help with day -to-day operations of the hub. To accomplish this learning, student volunteers spen t their first shifts going through a volunteer manual while being paired one -on-one with an experienced staff member who guided them through it and answered questions. They then shadowed the staff member and later, they were shadowed by the staff member to ensure accuracy in helping students. After a month of volunteering, professional staff observed the volunteers' customer service skills and interactions with student clients, as well as their behavior in helping with operational tasks such as stocking the pantry. Overall, the focus on personalized training and learning by being paired with an experienced staff proved successful in the learning process because volunteers were able to learn gradually while having someone to guide them through the process . Use: Refining program/program changes; Reporting results SOAR FRESH Basic Needs Internship Program PROFESSIONAL & ADMINSTRATIVE SKILLS Basic Needs Interns in the SOAR's FRESH Basic Needs Internship Program will gain knowledge of basic needs insecurity i ssues in Higher Ed, including Systemwide and UCI specific efforts to combat it and will produce a project proposal for a basic needs intervention or program after completing a year -long internship program . Measured By: Pre and knowledge; Checklist of what student(s) did; Student performance (e.g., student oral presentation) rated using rubric; Interviews: one -on-one; Student product (e.g., portfolio, journal) rated without rubric; Student performance ( e.g., student oral presentation) rated without rubric . Results: The internship program only lasted for one quarter (Fall 2017) rather than a year as originally planned because we received a State \"Hunger Free Act\" grant that al lowed us to switch gears to hire more student staff for our CalFresh efforts and we no longer had capacity to continue running the internship. In Fall 2017, the interns participated in weekly meetings where they learned from different speakers about aspect s of basic needs insecurity in the college campus such as food security, housing security, homelessness, food justice and food sovereignty, food waste, nutrition and cultural wellness. In the weekly meetings, students participated in guided discussions and assigned readings and/or webinars. At the end of the quarter, students submitted a paper that asked them to select a particular aspect of the basic needs, discuss their interest in it, define how it might show up on college campuses and propose a solution and potential project(s) to address the issue. Student interns were evaluated with a rubric based on whether or not they addressed all portions of the paper prompt, as well as the quality of their research and feasibility of their proposed solution. Stude nts participating in the internship program obtained grades of 83% and above and were successful at achieving the learning goals of the first quarter of the internship. Examples of their proposed projects include: creating a food recovery kitchen on campus to help redistribute unused food; revamp campus gardens as a way to increase food availability in the pantry; open a career clothing closet to help students who can't afford professional attire for job interview; and creating emergency beds for housing in secure students .

MAJOR ISSUES Continued growth issues with the NPHC fraternity and sorority community Maintaining the cost for fraternities and sororities to continue to have a safe and effective charter bus program. Having the appropriate resources (staff, budget, time, & facility) to implement the ongoing Level 2 core concepts from the SVSA Student Core Content Education Framework to over 2,400+ fraterni ty/sorority me mbers will be very challenging. The UCOP education expectations and inconsistent communication might impact how staff resources are prioritized. Increasing volunteer alumni advisor support for cultural fraternities and sororities. STUDENT LIFE & LEADERSHIP GREEK LIFE Potential N egative Trend : As the academic environment has become more competitive, it has been observed that students are stretched very thin. Some have shown signs of poor time management and an inability to effectively prioritize their extracurricular commitments. This has affected organizational success and annual community growth . XI. MISCELLANEOUS None XII. 2017 -18 ACCOMPLISHMENTS VIOLENCE INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION (VIP) PROGRAM Leadership Program Greek Life and the CARE office have partnered for seven years. The VIP pr ogram executed a successful kickoff retreat which helped increase retention and commitment to the program. The VIP program continues to be an annual accomplishment. The class was held weekly for the first time. Additionally, more cultural fraternities/so rorities participated in the VIP program . CHAPTER PRESIDENT MEETINGS Leadership Development This past year, the Greek Life staff made meeting with chapter presidents a big priority. Through strategic messaging, 84% of chapter presidents met with a Greek L ife staff member at least one time during the spring quarter. During the year quarter chapter president meetings with Greek Life staff increased from 69% in the fall quarter to 78% in the winter quarter and finally to 84% in the spring quarter. Meetings were tracked to identify which chapters were not engaged . COUNCIL EXECUTIVE OFFICERS JOINT RETREAT Leadership Development A joint council retreat with the newly elected council officers and Greek Life staff was held at the Team Up course at the ARC. Th e retreat focused on team building amongst the councils. GREEK PRESIDENT COUNCIL MICRO -LEARNING Leadership Development At the weekly Greek President Council (GPC) meeting, a series of micro -learning topics was implemented during the winter and spring qua rters. The winter quarter focused on personal leadership styles, leading complex organizations and organizational change. The spring quarter focused on personal and group identities and the impact on leading people. AFLV WEST FRATERNAL LEADERSHIP CONFER ENCE Leadership Sent 2 7 student leaders to the AFLV (Association of Fraternal Leadership and Values) West Fraternal Leadership Conference in San Diego . The AFLV West Leadership Conference is a four -day student conference that offers five nationally recogni zed and highly south after keynote speakers, six professional and very popular nationally known featured speakers, 60 educational sessions, an awards and assessment program, pre -conference workshops, targeted institutes and an unprecedented opportunity to network with fellow fraternity/sorority leaders. STUDENT LIFE & LEADERSHIP GREEK LIFE GREEK -WIDE MARKETING NARRATIVE Brand Messaging Continued to engage in targeting messaging over the summer to incoming & 2nd-year students. Our brand messaging was increased using Instagram Stories and high lighting chapters and individual fraternity/sorority members. (Context from previous year) Contracted with Innova Greek to do market research and develop an All -Greek marketing narrative that resulted in a consistent story about the fraternity/sorority ex perience . CRM technology was implemented to track interested students and enroll them in a drip campaign to receive the new Greek Life story. This past year, we had a keynote and conducted student interviews. The result was an updated narrative report.

THOSE SERVED International 69 International scholars -1,284 International spouses and dependents - 500 V. HISTORY 1965- 79 The Office of Disabled and International Student Services provided services and visa documentation for international students. Services to international scholars were provided as a courtesy. 1979- 80 Name changed to Office of International Student Services and continued to provide visa documentation. Implemented student orientation and programs for international students. 1980- 84 Services to international scholars i ncreased with the establishment of the Exchange Visitor (J -1) program to provide documentation and services to J -1 scholars and filing of Permanent Residency applications. The office began offering visa workshops for department staff. 1984 -85 Centraliza tion of all immigration and visa services for the entire campus, including the College of Medicine and UCIMC. Office started filing H -1B petitions. 1986- 89 The U.S. Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) was passed. As a result of IRCA, completion of employment paperwork for internationals was centralized in the office. Training to department staff increased. 1990- 95 Major changes in regulations resulted in increased requirements in filing H -1B petitions and providing services to J -1 and F -1 popula tions. Completion of annual tax treaty documentation began. Extended Orientation class was established. Office was relocated from 201 Administration to the University Tower in 1990 and again in 1994 to Student Services I. Office was renamed International C enter (IC). 1996- 97 New regulations were introduced that had an impact on institutional compliance and services provided by the IC: The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRAIRA); Executive Order 12989 and USIA Exchang e Visitor STUDENT LIFE & LEADERSHIP INTERNATIONAL CENTER Act. IC works to ensure compliance and education campus community of changes. IIRAIRA begins the discussion of electronic reporting to government. 1998 University Extension ESL and Certificate Program obtained own F -1 program and the IC ceased to provide immigration services to UNEX. 1999- 2001 IC continued to provide services to the campus. Student involvement in programs was high between the American English in Action, American Friendship Partner Program and the International and American Cl ub. 2001- 02 9/11 had substantial impact on immigration and travel requiring additional staff time for consultation with departments and international students and scholars. Obtaining visas became difficult and the IC staff spent more time educating campu s, responding to inquiries and advising student and scholars. 2003 The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) was implemented by the Department of Homeland Security, along with restructuring of government agencies and government oversig ht on institutions. Business practices changed dramatically. The IC was now required to report the arrival, enrollment of each student and scholar, along with any other changes. The IC coordinated various work groups, training sessions and established new business processes to meet government regulations. IC moved to the 6 th Floor of the Aldrich Hall. 2004- 07 SEVIS regulations burdened staff with compliance issues, resources were shifted to government compliance. Training workshops, communication with ca mpus personnel increases; workflow continued to be revamped to ensure institutional compliance. IC moved (again!) to Berkeley Place. 2007- 09 IC moved to the former Housing Administrative Services building. This space allowed the IC to increase workshops and offer opportunities for international students and scholars to meet one another. English Corner (now known as English Conversation Program) was implemented. 2009 Recharge established for services to academic departments to offset budget cuts and continue to provide services for scholars. 2010 Recruitment of international students resulted in increased workload f or issuance of visa documents. New handbook for international students published to provide pre - arrival information to new students. IC s uccessfully provided orientation and other welcome week activities for students. 2011 Fall Welcome Program is modified to meet the specific needs of the incoming international Freshman students I -STEPS is introduced in Fall 2011 International Center is relocated to UCI Student Center to benefit from central campus location 2012 International Center increased the number of programs, activities and events to meet the needs of the growing international student population. The first International Studen t Orientation (ISO) was offered to incoming international freshman students. Program was coordinated by Student Life and Leadership. STUDENT LIFE & LEADERSHIP INTERNATIONAL CENTER 2013 2014 International Center added 3 FTE to continue to increase the number of programs, activities and events to m eet the needs of growing international population. iNavigate UCI is implemented in the Fall of 2014. iNavigate UCI is an online orientation and check -in system for new international students. This innovative approach allows students to complete the Intern ational Center orientation and immigration check -in process electronically I-STEPS: International Students Transitioning to Educational and Personal Success continues to grow in numbers of students participating. I -STEPS has been showcased at regional and national conferences and has been recognized as a best practice within the International Education field. 2016 International Center added 1 FTE to support visa documents processing and mandated compliance reporting The International Center began scan ning and creating digital records for Fall 2016 admits. International Center hosted an open house for international parents during Interna - tional Student Orientation. This event is an effort to provide outreach to international parents and have them become familiar with International Center services and programs. 2017 2018 Increased outreach to academic departments to train on regulatory requirements of F-1 and J -1 students, workshops included: Employment Options for F -1 and J -1 Students and Common Forms Overview for F -1 and J -1 Students. International Center provided extensive outreach and education to the campus after the U.S. President signed Executive Order titled \"Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United Sta tes\"; as well as continued the outreach during various court decisions and re- introduction of an updated Executive Order in March 2017. The International Center staff continues to manage changes in immigration regulatory changes; including outreach to cam pus, updating publications and education international students and scholars. These changes include, the final version of the President's travel ban, increase Requests for Evidence at immigration service centers; unlawful presence policy and notice to appe ar policy; as well as increased vetting during visa applications. The International Center increases use of technology for record keeping and processing; including the implementation of paperless file storage in which all student and scholar files are kep t in an electronic format in current database.

V. HISTORY The Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Resource Center (LGBTRC) was the result of recommendations made over an eight -year period by the Chancellor's Advisory Committee on the Status of Lesbians and Gay Men and the Gay, L esbian, Bisexual Student Union. On March 11, 1994 former Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Horace Mitchell, met with the LGB community and announced that a Resource Center would be established at UCI. He also announced the funding for a full -time positio n to staff the Center. During Winter quarter of 1995, Pat Walsh was selected as the Director of the LGBT Resource Center and 106 Gateway Commons was designated as the Resource Center's home. The LGBT Resource Center officially opened Spring quarter of 1995 . In 2007 the Director Pat Walsh retired and the LGBT Res ource Center moved into a brand new location in the new Student Center. The new location on the third floor of the Student Center in G301 provides more visibility on campus while continuing to be a s afe space for UCI 's LGBT community. In April, 2008 Davidian Bishop, a long -time collaborator, advisory board member and advocate became the second Director for the resource center. Davidian has been involved with the LGBTRC since the doors opened more tha n 23 years ago. The Resource Center is housed under the Student Life & Leadership, along with the Cross -Cultural Center, International Center and other programs within Student Life & Leadership cluster . VI.

ADVISORY COMMITTEE Disbanded until we have steady resources that allow us to implement any salient recommendations X. MAJOR ISSUES GENERAL STRESS COMPOUNDED BY SEXUAL ORIENTAT ION, GENDER IDENTITY and MULTIPLE IDENTITY INTERSECTIONALITY LGBTQIA students have all the stressors on any student at UC plus the added pressure of being queer, transgender or multiple intersectional identities. Being LGBTQIA in itself is not the problem, but hostile environment, anti -LGBTQIA+ language, fear of being outed and other issues, all contribute to added stress. The recent climate survey shows 6% identify as LGB, 1% as Transgender, 6% as Asexual 82% identified as Heterosexual. This means up to 18% may identify as not Heterosexual. Our students come from various religious and cultural backgrounds that may or may not be welcoming of their queer identities, pushing well beyond the typical stressors of college and exacerbated by competing identit ies and cultural pres - sures. Local community colleges that track non -binary identities (genderqueer, etc.) have shared data that as many as 27% of students in college now identify as non -binary. In the LGBT Resource Center our numbers are even higher . DEPR ESSION AND MALADAPTIVE COPING STRATEGIES The UC mental health report places LGBT youth populations in two of four tiers and among some of the highest for being \"at risk .\" This reflects national data showing LGBT students at much higher levels than their pe ers for maladaptive coping strategies such as, alcohol, drugs, suicide, tobacco use; areas such as eating disorders and body image are on the rise, as well . The literature also shows increased depression for fluid i.e.: bisexual, transgender, g enderqueer , asexual ). SUICIDE AS A RESULT OF BULLYING In recent years, suicide due to bullying of LGBTQ students and those perceived to be LGBTQ has become recognized nationally. Data from a variety of national reports show LGBTQ youth to be in the highest \"at risk\" categories. Many students have substantiated these reports with personal stories of thoughts of suicide, depression, or actual attempts at suicide when working through their queer identities when there is little support. The students who identif y on the gender variant spectrum (transgender, genderqueer, non- binary etc.) are even at a greater risk due to additional life challenges and stigmatization according to National Transgender Discrimination Survey Report on Health and Health Care 2011. For students of color that are already minoritized, to also be LGBTQ+ absolutely increases the forms of violence experienced whether physical or emotional . STUDENT LIFE & LEADERSHIP LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL, TRANSGENDER RESOURCE CENTER (LGBTRC) VIOLENCE AGAINST LGBTQ AND THOSE TO BE PERCEIVED AS LGBTQ In recent years, multiple transgender women o f color have been attacked and murdered across the country. Some of this violence occurred in our own back yard in Santa Ana. This is an intersection of identities that experiences systematic oppression on multiple levels. The murders have a ripple effect in our own trans communities, communities of color and queer folk at large. Students are concerned about their safety and visibility as targets. Many transgender issues are on the rise in media which generates much interest in the politics of \"being transg ender,\" but that does not mean there are enough supports in place to help the students manage being so highly visible. Need for more LGBT counselors: Over the last 6.5 years at the resource center, the one -on-one and responses to students in crisis and tho se requiring personal consults has increased. Currently, the director and Assistant Director provide counseling for roughly 6 -8 hours per week. The programmer for the office also has felt the increase in individual consultations. More than a year ago, we w ere funded through SFAC allocations to hire a part -time Psychologist for our center. They are funded at .2 FTE. They spend 3 -4 hours per week in our space attending relevant programs and holding office hours. They act as a conduit to get students into t he counseling center. They may see students in the counseling center once proper intake has been established, but they do not do therapy in our resource center. Like the rest of our staff, they may however provide support and referral. This kind of inte nsive dialogue and much needed support as described above to support students in crisis makes it difficult to accomplish the other tasks and goals of the LGBTQ Resource Center . LACK OF CONSISTENT FUNDING (ON GOING PROBLEM) The lack of a permanent operating budget is insufficient to provide education to the larger campus, manage all the issues and challenges of the LGBTQIA community and simultaneously execute all LGBTQIA - related programmi ng for the entirety of a 30,000 plus student campus . Although we receiv e funding from Student Life and Leadership each year, that is money is based on many variables and is an allowance of sorts. Should SLL's ability to generate revenue through summer orientation program dip, or if other departments require more funding, the LGBTRC will have nothing permanent to fall back on. THE LGBTQ IA COMMUNITY I S OFTEN RENDERED INVISIBLE Campus clubs, groups, departments and organization do not always have the awareness to include the needs of the LGBT community in planning for larger camp us events. During my attempts to gather the queer staff and faculty I learned that many di d not feel safe participating. Several were concerned about the climate at UCI, specifically that being visible could keep them from garnering promotions or make the m vulnerable to harassment by colleagues. Some of these employees are fearful about taking this to OEOD, Ombudsman office, etc. because the process will out them and position them immediately in a place of conflict. There are staff and faculty at all level s who have shared confidentially that in their areas they stay closeted because to be \"visible\" would impede their potential for promotion or result in harassing or marginalizing behavior. As a note two years ago, the LGBTQ Staff and Faculty Network disban ded completely for lack of participation or anyone w illing to step into leadership. Also, it should be noted while this commentary represents some staff and faulty experiences, many LGBTQIA staff and faculty have no problem being \"out\" and visible and feel this is a place where their queer identity is supported. While most agree there is always room for improvement on this or any campus, many queer folk have expressed having had a good overall experience at UCI. (see next sec tion for UC wide overview). STUDENT LIFE & LEADERSHIP LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL, TRANSGENDER RESOURCE CENTER (LGBTRC) Stud ents will always struggle to find mentors and role models that are so common to non -LGBTQIA students. Sheer lack of numbers, fear of being out on campus and routine omission by the larger non - queer campus has consistently threatened to render our community invisible . OBSERVATIONS AND TRENDS The UC LGBT Directors Council developed a working \"lavender paper\" to share their observations regarding LGBT student populations on UC campuses and the unique challenges in serving their needs. Below are major points, updated in 2010. 1. LGBT Resource Centers require a level of confidentiality unique to student services. Students do not want to sign into LGBT programs, often hide from family and friends that they visit the LGBT resource center and purposely avoid being see n with LGBT center staff. Request that letters of recommendation do not use LGBTRC letterhead or refer to \"diversity programs\" rather than explicitly LGBT involvement. Alumni request their names be removed from LGBT awards web pages and even Allies Safe Zo ne web pages. 2. LGBT Resource Centers function as Cross -cultural Centers, bringing together students of different ethnicity , race, religion, ability, etc. This creates great opportunities for dialogue and social justice work. Students claim a spectrum of sex ual and gender identities and they often require greater understanding of different experiences within their own LGBT communities, too. 3. LGB (sexual orientation) students often require as much education as straight students regarding transgender ( gender ide ntity ) issues . Within the LGBT community, although students are learning about gender identity and expression, it is often misunderstood. 4. While many policies and procedures are in place to support sexual minorities, transgender students struggle to navigat e campuses that ignore their needs or deny their existence. 5. More students are identifying with non -monosexual identities, such as bisexual, pansexual, fluid, or \"don't label me.\" Biphobia, however, continues to be a challenge within and without the LGBT community. 6. Asexuality is an emerging identity and according to surveys of our campus they represent 6% of our population. These individuals have very s pecific needs to be addressed. We are working to provide education to the larger campus on a sexual /aromanti c identities and how UCI can affirm these people and cr eate a supportive environment. This is being done through education, trainings, creating support groups/networks and engaging departments that work closely with students to better understand this growi ng population and its needs. 7. Student athletes, fraternity/sorority members and students in other small social circles are less likely to access LGBT services out of a fear of being \"outed.\" Some will not even join anonymous online chats, stating they canno t give their student ID to professional staff in case they our accidentally \"outed\" to teammates or Greek letter brothers or sisters. 8. Many students of color feel they must choose between communities of color (where they may experience homophobia and transp hobia) and the LGBT community (where they may experience racism). They may avoid either LGBT Resource Centers or ethnic -based program offices. 9. While students of color may report acts of racism or even micro aggressions , they may not report anti-LGBT bias. Students are believed when they report racism. They are questioned when they report homophobia, or have their experiences minimized. Many LGBT students are so desensitized to verbal abuse and harassment that it does not occur to them to report bias inciden ts that happen routinely. 10. LGBT Resource Center staff must also navigate hostile climates and situations. Member s of the UC LGBT Directors Council have had vandalism of p roperty in their personal lives . If even role models for LGBT students struggle with an ti-LGBT environments, LGBT and questioning students face STUDENT LIFE & LEADERSHIP LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL, TRANSGENDER RESOURCE CENTER (LGBTRC) extremely difficult challenges navigating social situations. 11. LGBT students are self -selecting out of majors and careers, because of internalized homophobia or because of overt homophobia in the caree r field. Students are less likely to major or be \"out\" in medicine, Engineering, business and K-12 education. 12. Some s tudents are going back into the closet upon graduation or during the job search. They create resumes that remove mention of LGBT leadership involvement. Some choose to audit rather than register for LGBT studies courses that would show up on their transcript. Even straight allies are advised by some career counselors to remove mention of their involvement in Allies Safe Zone programs from thei r resumes. 13. Many LGBT student leaders are burned out from over -involvement in advocacy work in a challeng - ing campus climate. Lacking the professional resources they need, students try to provide missing services and resources to each other. 14. LGBT students ar e often \"out\" in one part of their life and not \"out\" in other areas. They thus must remain vigilant regarding who in their lives know their \"true selves.\" This leads to stress and an increased need for emotional support since many friends and family do no t know their \" true selves.\" 15. As LGBT resource center staff try to meet the needs of LGBT and questioning students, they are torn between competing needs to also do campus -wide education or policy work. A minimum staff of three people is the tipping point fo r meeting the priority of the campus. 16. Many students, staff and faculty at UCI are \"out ,\" visible and feel strongly that UCI is a wonderful and supportive campus for them and their identity. There are many who have not experienced micro -aggressions, expres sions of hate, or violence against them. Most staff and faculty agree they can be authentic in their queer identity to no negative effect. However, the LGBTQ Staff and Faculty Network has agreed over many years, there is much room for improvement. There i s a big difference between merely being accepted or tolerated as queer employees versus being embraced, supported, nurtured, or celebrated. In recent years, the UCOP LGBTQ task force (with representation from all campuses) wrote a paper to make requests fo r changes. One of the imperatives of that was the recommendation that all campuses should have Gender Inclusive facilities. UCI was already well ahead of many of its peers when this mandate came down, because we began to research and make similar recommend ations in 2009. By 2010 we already had more than 20 GIB across campus. By June 2016 we had more than 200 gender inclusive bathrooms across campus. XI. MISCELLANEOUS None XII. 2016 -17 ACCOMPLISHMENTS We hired a permanent Program Coordinator in the Summer of 2017. This position has helped us provide more programming and more presentations to the campus so we did not have to decline offers to provide critical education. We were able to provide more one -on-one support to students who are in crisis and who desire leadership development. This person also provided more desperately needed queer/trans visibility. They have been able to sit on committees and represent the needs of queer and transgender students in public spaces. We held our first QTPOC weekend festival. Appro ximately 80 students of color attended presentations and workshops that focused on issues facing QTPOC students. This event was designed to help attendees develop skills around wellness and resilience. We went through an external review to help us improve our services and better understand how our constituency and campus partners see us. We are still awaiting information and final report. STUDENT LIFE & LEADERSHIP LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL, TRANSGENDER RESOURCE CENTER (LGBTRC) Creation of a new program for white folx to learn, share and grow in understanding their whiteness and how that impact s communities of color. The goal is to shift the burden of reducing and when possible fix challenges of racism from people of color in our space, to white people. Developed Student Affairs Learning Outcomes for the majority of our programs. We provided mo re programs and educational moments than ever before in our 22 -year history. We had more than 400 events sponsored by the LGBTRC . XIII. 2018 -19 GOALS Continue to shift the way we approach our work to address those in our community most in the margins. We will be centering our work on Queer and Transgender Students of Color. We have always had programs for students of color, but across the nation, we are learning that institutional racism exists and limits students from reaching the goals we set for them. We are w orking with our leaders and listening to how we can better serve students of color that also identify as gender and sexual minorities. We maintain and continue to improve an ongoing space for white fox to learn about their whiteness and how to support comm unities of color and other marginalized groups and identities. Continue to meet the directives from UCOP for Gender Inclusive Facilities across UCI (including the Medical Center). SB179 was passed into law this year which allow for all California ID, drive rs license , birth certificates to allow individuals to identify as Male, Female and Non -Binary. This means the campus needs to be prepared to change data systems, forms, websites, brochures, information to capture the new NB identity. Additionally, stude nts, staff and faculty need training to learn, understand these identities so they can interact and communicate accurately when addressing folx with NB identities. The LGBTRC is working towards this goal. Other campuses that are in the lead on this have b een able to get their chancellors to create a committee with this specific charge. We are working to bring a consultant to help us look at and review our center and our programs o Housing - we are the sponsor of 2 housing units. \u00a7 Middle Earth - Open House (al l gender inclusive housing) \u00a7 Arroyo Vista - SPECTRUM LGBTQ theme house \u00a7 Ongoing trainings with other housing units to ensure their staff and interns understand the complex needs of the queer and transgender, non -binary communities. o DREAM Center \u00a7 We will be co llaborating and cross training to understand undocuqueer stu dents and create a safety net. This is a population that is at risk. \u00a7 We are planning a variety of collaborative efforts . o Davidian Bishop has been invited to sit on the National Board for Step UP!, the leading national by stander intervention training. One of Davidian's roles on this committee is to increase attention to communities that experience higher levels of marginalization.

ADVISORY COMMITTEE Consultation Team Case Management Team (CMT) X. MAJOR ISSUES The Office of Academic Integrity & Student Conduct (OAISC) continues to see an increase in case load involving complex cases related to mental health, disruptive behavior and threats of violence (perceived and real). There has been an increase in graduate and international students involved in the student conduct and academic integrity case management process. Students now involve attorneys, which has led Student Conduct to develop transparent guidelines on how attorneys can be involved in the student conduct process. There is a spotlight on colleges and universit ies across the nation on how they report, respond and work with the parties involved in sex offense cases. Student advocates have demanded a higher standard and were validated by legislators; for processes to be timely, support services provided and consis tent and trauma informed training for those involved in the administrative process. The Office of Academic Integrity & Student Conduct continues to maintain a high degree of collaboration and partnership with the Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity ( OEOD), UCI Police Department (UCIPD), the Campus Assault Resources and Education (CARE) office and Campus Counsel to ensure OAISC are meeting those standards. Since September 2017, the Office of Academic Integrity & Student Conduct has taken over adjudica tion of all cases of academic misconduct. Inconsistencies in reporting across the UCI Schools has revealed a need for increased education and outreach to both faculty and students in order to better support academic integrity on campus . XI.

THOSE SERVED Visitations: 3 ,427 The Student Outreach and Retention Center serves the campus community : students, staff, faculty and community members with a unique emphasis of underserved underrepresented students. V. HISTORY Since 2014 two programs and se rvices were initiated at SOAR by students, for students: Undocumented Students Programs and Food Access and Security services. Both of these initiatives gained support from the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) and received seed funds . These funds were used to hire the Dreamers Coordinator in fall 2014 and the Food Access and Sec urity Coordinator in fall 2015. In spring 2016, students ran and passed the SOAR Food Pantry campaign, securing funding for 10 years to address student food i nsecurity. In addition, UC President Napolitano approved a 2-year $150,000 grant proposed by the Global Food Initiative (GFI) Food Access & Security subcommittee. Furthermore, in fall 2016 the Student Fee Advisory Committee (SFAC) approved the proposal to fund the Dreamers Coordinator position indefinitely and UCOP extended and expanded the temporary funds for Undocumented Student Programs for an additional 3 years. This funding has since been used to hire a Director and establish the DREAM Center. The succ ess of both of these initiatives gained the support of the UCI Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs who allocated space for the creation of an independent DREAM Center and a new SOAR FRESH Basic Needs Hub. Both opened their doors on Sept . 27, 2017. VI. LOCATION 106 Gateway Student Center, Irvine CA 92697 VII.

AWARDS XIV. LEARNING OUTCOMES 2017-18 Updates SOAR Staff Training PROFESSIONAL & ADMINISTRATIVE SKILLS At their end of training prese ntations, SOAR student staff will demonstrate an increased knowledge of the challenges faced by first -generation, low -income, underrepresented and underserved students in higher education by stating five challenges and the campus resources available to hel p them overcome these challenges . Measured By: Student performance (e.g., student oral presentation) rated using rubric Results: After attending staff training, 100% of SOAR student staff were able to demonstrate knowledge of five retention barriers and challenges faced by first -generation, low -income, underrepresented and underserved students in higher education and uniquely at UCI. Each student was additionally able to demonstrate knowledge of UCI campus resources available to help overcome those ba rriers and challenges. This was measured through a presentation student staff members gave in which they described common student push -out factors and barriers under four core areas of need: financial, mental health and wellness, social and academic. When student staff members demonstrated their knowledge of retention barriers, more than half of them specifically referred to challenges and resources in the areas of financial and mental health . STUDENT LIFE & LEADERSHIP STUDENT OUTREACH AND RETENTION CENTER (SOAR) SOAR Pathways Program PROFESSIONAL & ADMINISTRATIVE SKILLS SOAR Peer Educators (Pathfinders) in the SOAR Pathways program will demonstrate their ability to follow the 10 -step consultation model in their consultations with student constituents . Measured By: Student performance (e.g., student oral presentation) ra ted using rubri c Results: 100% of the Pathfinders were able to demonstrate their ability to follow the 10 -step consultation model when holding consultations with student constituents. Pathfinders were trained on the 10 -step consultation model and were t aught how to effectively hold a peer -to-peer consultation. Student peer -to-peer consultations require Pathfinders to 1 ) Welcome, 2 ) Listen, 3) Assess, 4 ) Identify Flags, 5 ) Goal Setting and Remedy, 6 ) Refer, 7 ) Energize and Encourage (help student book a f ollow up appointment), 8 ) Conclude, 9 ) Document and Summarize, 10 ) Follow Up.

ADVISORY COMMITTEE The office does not have an advisory committee; however , the Student Affairs Task Force on Veteran s can sometimes serve in t his capacity for V eteran Services . X. MAJOR ISSUES LIMITED STAFFING RESOURCES Although the VSC now has two (2) FTE s, the reality is that other campuses have anywhere from 4-6 staff members, either in the Veteran Resource Center (VRC) or a combination of staf f supporting their veteran students if the certifying officials aren't in the VRCs. The VSC needs a full-time certifying official due to the increase in dependents using benefits; this will allow the time needed of the Assistant Director to provide 1 -on-1 advising and to connect students with resources and professional development opportunities. There has also been an increase in the Directors' commitments off -campus to elevate the image of the VSC and seek funding through external foundations. Creating thi s position would e nsure that the VSC doesn't lose oppor tu- nities to seek funding and will allow for the VSC to maximize grant usage because the staffing hasn't been sufficient to execute successfully. STUDENT LIFE & LEADERSHIP VETERAN SERVICES CENTER There is also an expectation that the Veteran Talent Re integration Conference series will continue in 2018 -2019 by campus leadership and veteran agency partners . UCI has been voted on as the Convener for the Orange County Veteran & M ilitary Family Collaborative. I n order for this conference and these programs to be successful , a program coordinator manager that is responsible for executing both these endeavors would have to be hired . MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES Despite the many leadership skills that veterans bring to the campus, veterans continue to see an increase i n counseling needs & mental health services due to PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) and/or TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury). We need increased resources to meet this need, as there is often a stigma with looking to seek psychological services and the stud ents come to the VSC to seek assistance, divulging their crisis to our staff. In the past quarter alone the VSC staff encountered and assisted student veterans and dependents who had mental health concerns, domestic issues, sexual trauma, were fighting can cer and had difficulties transitioning into being a student and civilian. Hiring the Certifying Official and Program Manager for the Convener role and conference series will allow the Director and Assistant Director to provide the necessary case management and give them the time to walk students over for counseling assistance and provide them the resources available on and off campus . LIMITED SPACE Although the VSC moved into a new space this year it i s only about 200 sq. ft larger. It allowed for the Assi stant Director to have a space in the VSC, but there was not a large enough office for the Director to have one as well. It gave the VSC an additional small office space to grow for one potential new hire. It is still lacking a hang -out space that is sepa rate from where business is being conducted and a much -needed study space that veterans have been asking for within the center . XI. MISCELLANEOUS None XII. 2017 -18 ACCOMPLISHMENTS The VSC relaunched the VetNet Ally Program this year with the help of co -presenters from the Disability Services Center and Counseling Center. It was launched with great success as the two sessions filled to capacity with 35 -40 person waiting lists. We hope to continue to do them quarterly throughout the year. A proposal to renew the OCCF Orange County Real Estate Veterans Initiative grant w as submitted this past summer. Unfortunately, it was not renewed because we still had funding remaining at the conclusion of the grant. We were able to extend the initial grant and use it throughout thi s academic year for the veteran course and emergency grants. Awarded by the Parent Executive Board as an Anteater Grant Initiative Awardee to re- new the Kognito Veterans on Campus Training program.

SERVICES PROVIDED The W -HUB provides workshops, panels and lectures that inform the primary population concerning issues relevant to women. IV. THOSE SERVED Student s, staff, faculty, parents and the greater UCI community. V. HISTORY The Womxn 's HUB came about due to the collab oration of some Dynamic Womxn. The director of the UCI Cross -Cultural Center, Jade Agua, in discussion with Tamara Austin , who at the time was ser ving as the Gender Initiative Director , met up to discuss the absence of a Womxn 's Center on the UCI campus. Through discussions with other colleagues, we discovered that UCI had a rich history with a previous Womxn 's center and due to budget cuts, the cen ter was disbanded. Looking at the number of women who were coming to the Cross- Cultural Center and specifically accessing the Gender Initiative person for resources, we thought it was time to bring the Womxn 's center back with a reboot for the future and a base from the past. Working with alumni, current students, staff and faculty, we renovated a space in the Cross- Cultural Center , and in September 2017, the W- HUB was launched. The W -HUB became an instant hit with the students , and we are happy to report that we have served over 1, 000 students in our first year. The resource center serves as a resting place for Womxn. In the space, Womxn can feel free to have discussions regarding anything that makes their world turn. The space is an open forum where any and all topics can be engaged in. We have had professors hold office hours at the space because students felt comfortable in the center. We have had a Faculty -In-Residence who was instrumental in assisting Womxn with finding their voice in the classroom and in their personal and professional worlds. The W -HUB will continue to meet Womxn where they are and provide resources for them to grow into their desired version. Well behaved womxn rarely make history. Here at the W - HUB, womxn make history every day . Historically, women have had to fight in order to be recognized for their talents and skill sets. There was a time when the popular thinking was that women 's minds were too delicate to deal with politics and they were too fragile to handle money or own property in their names. Although women may have gained ground in various sectors of society there are still lingering ideas about what gender equality should look like. Women are still being paid less than their male counterparts , and the continuing stere otypes about women and women -identified individuals plague all members of our society. The Womxn 's Center focuses on women -specific needs and ideas through workshops, trainings and space interaction to assist women in discovering their personal empowerment . The space also offers ideas and tips to assist women in career development and personal growth. We are an open space where many women have had and will continue to have dialogue that informs their lives. Our space is open and affirming to all who believe in the strength of women, women identified persons and all allies. You can stop in for a piece of chocolate, a cup of tea or respite from our chaotic world. STUDENT LIFE & LEADERSHIP WOMXN'S CENTER VI. LOCATION Cross -Cultural Center VII.

Measured By: Pre and Post surveys of student opinions; Interviews: one -on-one; s tudent product (e.g., portfolio, journal) rated without rubric interviews Results: Filming Intramural Basketball games allowed us to create a specific YouTube channel for referees to access their game film. We were able to breakdown film from 10 games, which included 15 unique referees. In subsequent interview follow -up, when asked about their confidence level before watching their game film compared to after, all 15 referees agreed they felt more confident going into their next work shift. They felt that through watching their abilities, mannerisms and communication with participan ts, they felt more prepared to handle difficult situations that could arise in the future. All 15 referees were able to diagnose three ways to improve their overall management of an Intramural Sports game, many of them citing \"to be more proactive in appro aching a participant who appears to be losing control.\" All referees felt they learned mediation skills that were transferable \"life skills,\" and 9 referees were able to analyze a personal/social situation where they directly put into use these skills learned from refereeing .

Collaborative partnerships with on and off -campus agencies and the ongoi ng meetings of the Coordinated Community Review (CCR) Team ensured comprehensive support of all victims' needs. The OVW Campus grant provided important resources to build upon existing strengths and successes in our ongoing implementation of the four minim um requirements: 1) establishment and continued training of a CCR team, 2) design and implementation of a mandatory prevention education program, 3) specialized training of campus police, and 4) training for campus disciplinary boards. UCI CARE completed t he third and final year of the 2014- 17 renewal grant from OVW and were awarded another 3 -year OVW Campus grant for 2 017-2 0. OVW grant funds supported 50% of the full -time UCI Victim Advocate position in the CARE office through the end of 2017. The Office of the President for the UC system has recognized Advocacy as a critical service for students and has made campus -sourced funding for CARE Advocate positions a requirement on all UC campuses. At the close of the 2014 -17 Campus Grant, the UCI Advocate posi tion was becoming 100% institutionally supported. The Campus grant also continued funding the Green Dot Bystander Intervention program and the continued activities of our Holistic Healing program for those students affected by sexual violence.

VISION & MISSION VISION To be a leader in collegiate health promotion by focusing on the unique and relevant health nee ds and concerns of UCI students in support of their academic success. MISSION We empower students to make informe d decisions t hat support individual health and a healthy campus environment by providing comprehensive programs and coordinated services to: Build awareness through assessment and goal -setting Create balance by taking a wellness -based approach to health Develop healthy and sustainable habits Take pride in achieving one's personal best Inspire community by leading fellow Anteaters to be healthy CORE VALUES Advocacy Awareness Empowerment VALUES The mission of the Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotio n is upheld by utilizing our expertise in innovative and relevant programming to the UCI community. The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion (CSWHP) focuses on health topic areas identified through various assessment efforts. Our programs are unique in their abilities to meet the students in the spaces where they are most comfortable, in order to tackle issues that can be sensitive in nature. Our programming is often facilitated in residence halls, organizational meetings and other safe spaces for students. The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion is the only department on campus that houses full -time health promotion staff to focus on issues that are integral to college health and wellness , such as alcohol and other drugs, sexual and relationship health, general wellness and life balance , nutrition and mental health. Part of our mission is to facilitate student development and leadership opportunities. With the continued growth and development of the Publi c Health program on campus, the CSWHP has become a natural partne r with students in this major. We provide the only opportunity on campus for these students to become involved with health promotion on a college campus. Many students in public health, social ecology, pre-medical and dental programs flock to the CSWHP to find ways to become involved on campus and in the community. With stress, anxiety, sleep and other related mental health concerns being reported by students as some o f t h e m o s t c o m m o n b a r r i e r s t o t h e i r a c a d e m i c s u c c e s s , t h e Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion made a commitment to a dedicated space for students to address these concerns. Various relaxation and stress -reduction techniques ar e taught through our workshops to help manage the various forms of stress in their lives. Alcohol and other drug use can be another barrier students experie nce to their academic success. The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion is a primary referral source for students who may h ave challenges in these areas. Our trained staff provide s services including a weekly Alcohol Awareness Class, WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CENTER FOR STUDENT WELLNESS & HEALTH PROMOTION Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention for College Students (BASICS), individual consultations for other drugs and smoking cessation support. These services are intended as early interv ention techniques and strategies to ensure students are successful in pursuit of their academic and personal goals. The CSWHP is also the only provider of free condoms, both male and female, lube and dental dams on the UCI campus. The Cond om Co- Op was fou nded in 2011 -12 and provides education and information about safe r sex, as well as ensuring that accessibility to condoms do es not become a barrier to practicing safer sex. The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion is also the only place on campu s that p rovide s free and anonymous HIV testing for the UCI community. The UCI community can be tested without fear of their results being tied to their identity. In an effort to be as inclusive as possible to the various needs of the campus, the Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion also offers two unique resources. For nursing mothers, the C SWHP is one of three locations on campus that offe rs a private Lactation Station. This space provides nursing mothers with a private space to breast feed or pum p and is attached to a private bathroom . That private bathroom also serves as the second resource : a gender -neutral restroom. This allows members of the campus community who prefer a gender -neutral restroom option to have it available in a safe and private locat ion. II.

THOSE SERVED During the 2017 -18 academic school year (July 2017 -June 2018) the Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion provided outstanding programs & services to the UCI community primarily focused on increasing workshop presentations, adding new programming and collaborating with both new and established campus partners to meet the health and wellness needs of the undergraduate and graduate students. The CSWHP participated in many new events this year and expanded their overall outreach an d collaboration with other departments such as housing (Mesa Court, Middle Earth, Campus Village and Arroyo Vista), Student Life & Leadership, Student Health Center, Cross -Cultural Center, CARE, Counseling Center, Athletics, Greek Life, Hospitality & Dinin g, Career Pathways, ASUCI, International Center and SOAR. In addition, Program Managers expanded their existing relat ionships with campus partners. Some examples are increased programming with the Global Sustainability Resource Center, ASUCI's Student Life and Advocacy Commission, the C ounseling Center and Student Life & Leadership . Such collaborations have enriched both the health and wellness of students and of faculty and staff. This year the CSWHP facilitated and/or collaborated in 141 different events on campus (43% increase) reaching a total of 17,449 students (59% increase). The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion also conducted 239 Healthy Tune -Up Workshops reaching 6,344 students on a variety of health and wellness topics. New workshops were added this year such as a drop -in meditation class, an introduction to mindfulness and yoga series, cooking demonstrations, goal setting and resiliency. The responses from almost 500 students collected through both in -person focus groups and an online survey and another survey conducted at the Reclaim Mental WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CENTER FOR STUDENT WELLNESS & HEALTH PROMOTION Health Conference in 2017 of another 95 students, showed a request/need for more yoga and meditation classes, cooking demonstrations, mental health awareness and therapy dogs on campus to help red uce stress and increase self- care practices. Overall, workshops provide students with important health information and effective coping skills to improve their health, wellness and academic success using a variety of engagi ng and interactive activities. Students also learn about their campus resources. CSWHP also offers a variety of services to students such as individual consultations, a Lactation Station, HIV Testing, emergency feminine products and the Condom Co- Op.

Individual consultations allow students to build knowledge and skills to improve their health and wellness, as well as ask questions anonymously in a safe and comfortable space. The Lactation Station continues to give nursing parents a clean, safe and private space to nurse and/or pump for their infant children. Students, staff and faculty are welcome to use this service, as well as individuals participating in conferences at the Student Center. There were 345 visits accounting for 7% of the visits to the CSWHP. Fifteen BASICS (Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention for College Students) sessions and 28 Alcohol Awareness Classes (with 177 participants) were completed during th e 2017- 18 school year. A BASICS session is a one -on- one motivational intervention for high -risk college students to reduce problem drinking, excessive drinking and binge drinking. Students are encouraged to adopt healthier choices and are given coping skills to moderate drinking. An Alcohol Awareness Class is a group class for first -time offenders and designed to educate students about the facts and dangers of alcohol as well as how to s tay safe and keep others safe. This continues to be a remarkable colla boration between the CSWHP, campus housing and the Office of Academic Integrity & Student Conduct. The HIV testing program has been very successful in providing free, confidential and anonymous testing to students. HIV continues to be highly stigmatized and feared so providing an environment where students can feel safe, comfortable and learn about the importance of testing is crucial. Students receive their results in 20 minutes using the Federally -approved Oraquick In -Home HIV Testing kit and receive important information on the importance of other STI screenings, establishing a well -care program while at UCI and discussing healthy sexual and relationship behaviors and practices. The budget for HIV kits during the 2017- 18 year was 78 and 77 were used. In order to conserve the kits throughout the year for students who were at higher risk, referrals for HIV and other STIs were made to the Student Health Center, private insurances and community partners. The Condom Co -Op continues to be a popular and need ed service and accounts for a significant number of visits to the CSWHP (3,851 students). Students can access up to 10 free internal and external condoms and 5 lubes daily. The CSWHP provides a wide array of male condoms, female condoms and dental dams to meet the needs of the students. Approximately 39,343 condoms and dental dams were distributed to students and another 500 were donated to campus partners this year. 75 3064 22 22 SEXUAL HEALTH AOD NUTRITION EMOTIONAL WELLNESSWELLNESSNumber of Consultations Program AreaConsultations 2017 -18WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CENTER FOR STUDENT WELLNESS & HEALTH PROMOTION The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion facilitates and participat es in a variety of workshops and programs on the UCI campus, independently and collaboratively with many campus partners/departments and student organizations like ASUCI, Active Minds and the Public Health Association. These opportunities allow the department to broaden its reach and to meet the diversity and needs of UCI's undergraduate and graduate students. The focus of these efforts is to provide students with accurate and important health information, encourage and promote healthy behaviors and lifesty les, and provide students with resources and referrals to on and off campus partners and organizations to support their overall health and wellness needs. CSWHP provided the UCI community with 141 unique events throughout the year from annual events like the Zot Health Fair and Spring Fever to resource and leadership fairs to topic specific awareness events.

Every staff member from the Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion participates in at least one community coalition and/or task force. Several staff members also participate on the Healthy Campus Initiativ e workgroups (Sexual Health, Nutrition and AOD). The CSWHP has a robust Peer Health Education and Internship Program, in addition to accepting volunteers to assist with la rge-scale events. During the 2017 -18 year, a total of 30 Peer Health Educators and 15 internship students were trained and supervised to assist the CSWHP with programming, services, promotion a nd outreach to the UCI campus. The Peer Health Educators work with the Center for an entire academic year. The CSHWP is also a field study/pract icum site for the Program in Public Health and the Social Ecology. Students intern for one quarter, many of whom continue to volunteer after their internship. The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion has included outreach efforts to graduate st udents. All major events, such as the Zot Health Fair, Spring Fever, Sex Week @ UCI and De -Stress Fest were shared with Graduate Housing to encourage them to attend. Both the Wellness and Peer Health Education Manager and the Sexual & Relationship Health Program Manager participated in the PharmSci Department's Self- Care Fridays. All in all, CSWHP reached 29,243 students with some form of in -person contact with the various programs and services offered. An additional 9,623 students were reached through C SWHP's online programs and resources. This includes 9,623 who completed the FIRST (First -year Internet Required Safety Training) module on alcohol, which is required of all first- year and transfer students; 224 students who completed the E -Chug online alcohol assessment module (required of all alcohol referrals, but also available to any student to take); and 40 students who completed the E -Toke online marijuana assessment module (required of all marijuana referrals, but also avai lable to any student to tak e). This brings the total reach to 38,866 students. 2841814751382491544033365025190 0 100 200 300 400 500Sex Week @ UCISexual HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CENTER FOR STUDENT WELLNESS & HEALTH PROMOTION V. HISTORY The catalyst for Health Education was a CPR training program started in Student Health Services in the mid -1980s. Dr. Gerry Sinikin also supported a peer education program that sponsored an annu al health fair for students. Dr. Sinikin funded the fairs for many years as he chaired the Irvine Health Foundation. G r e e k A d v i s o r E l l e n R e i b l i n g w a s a w a r d e d o n e o f t h e f i r s t Fund for the Improvement of Post- Secondary Education (FIPSE ) grants for alcohol p revention programs in 1987. At the same time, David Souleles was developing an HIV/AIDS Education program for the Dean of Students Office. They joined forces in 1990 and opened Health Education in the Gateway Building adjacent to Aldrich Park. Thomas Parha m, Assistant Vice Chancellor, established the department as independent in 1994 when the Counseling and Health Services Cluster was formed and named Ellen Reibling the first director. The department moved into an expanded area when the Phase IV Student Cen ter renovation was completed in Fall 2008. The number of career positions has grown from 2.5 FTE to as many as 8 .0 FTE and is currently at 6.10 FTE. The department has sponsored an annual health fair since 1994. Health Education was awarded two regional di ssemination grants in the early 1990s to help other campuses establish alcohol prevention programs, providing consultations to CSU Fullerton, CSU Long Beach, Loyola Marymount, UC Riverside and University of La Verne before their programs were established. The department also distributed a student publication called the \"Project Aware Resource Bin \" which sold more than 200 copies. UCI Health Education hosted one regional and two national prev ention meetings in the mid 1990 s and this tradition continues today . Peer education programs have been offered for academic credit from Education, Social Ecology and Social Sciences with emphasis on alcohol (Students to Enhance Peer Sobriety or STEPS) and general health (Community Peer Health Educators). The Center for St udent Wellness & Health Promotion now has its own formal Peer Educator program, managed by our Wellness & Pe er Education Programs Manager. The program consists of three topic -based groups: Alcohol and Other Drugs (AOD), Sexual Health, and Wellness. The department has also supported four student organizations: IMAGE (Body image awareness), START (Tobacco), RADD Crew (alcohol education and DUI prevention) and Active Minds (emotional health). The department has been significantly supported by grants throughou t its history . Funders have included US Department of Education (FIPSE and Office of Safe and Drug Free Schools), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA ), National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), California Office of Traffic Safet y, California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs, Irvine Health Foundat ion, Community Alliance Network and Califo rnia Tobacco Control Section. For many years, Health Education hosted AIDS Walk Orange County and was the only prevention organization receiving an annual grant allocation. In June 2015, after celebrating its 25 th Anniversary as the Health Education Center, the department officially changed its name to the Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion in order to align itself with American College Health Association (ACHA ) and Council for the Advancement of Standards in Higher Education (CAS) standards and guidelines , and the field of health promotion in general. The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion continues to be a national l eader in hosting regional and national events. In February of 2013, we hosted the California Statewide Wellness & Health Promotion Directors meeting. In November 2015, the campus hosted the national Active Minds College Mental Health Conference due to the success of o ur campus Active Minds Chapter. In May of 2016, the campus hosted the national Step Up! Bystander Facilitator Training Conference. VI. LOCATION G319 Student Center South ZOT: 6125 WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CENTER FOR STUDENT WELLNESS & HEALTH PROMOTION The department moved into this expanded area when the Phase IV Stude nt Center renovation was completed in fa l l 2 0 0 8 a n d n o w s h a r e s s o m e s p a c e w i t h CARE (Campus Assault Resources & Educ ation) as of fall 2011. The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion is located on the same floor as k ey Student Affairs departments i ncluding Student Life & Leadership; the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual (LGBT) Resource Center; International Student Center; Veteran Services; and Hospitality & Dining Services. This strengthens our ability to serve students' needs as well as effec tively partner with colleagues on projects and initiatives. VII. ASSETS Major facilities, technologies and equipment The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion occupies approximately 2 ,000 sq . ft. of space including approximately 900 sq. ft. of office s pace, 520 sq. ft. of student work space (shared with CARE) , 220 sq. ft. conference room (shared with CARE) , 200 sq. ft. of reception/lobby area , 120 sq . ft. storage room , and 85 sq. ft. consultation room (Lactation Station and other private consultations). TECHNOLOGY Computers, digital displays, camera/video equipment, audience -response clicker system/software and other basic technology equip ment EQUIPMENT The only equipment asset for CSWHP, based on the $10,000 value mark, is our golf cart, which is requir ed to haul programming and outreach supplies/equipment to the various programs and activities that we provide for the campus. VIII. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS The campus First -year Internet Required Safety Training (FIRST) module, an alcohol/sexual assault training required for all first -year and transfer students to UCI. This is a shared responsibility with CARE . We actively participate in the coordination of compliance with the federal Drug -Free Schools and Communities Act, collecting and providing data and feedb ack on the student side of the requirement. We also do an annual review of relevant areas (primarily AOD) of the campus Clery/ASR report. For a complete list of Student Affairs mandates, please refer to the Appendix. IX. ADVISORY COMMITTEE Not applicable X. MAJO R ISSUES Budget cuts to Health Education since 2002 c ontinue to be a major concern. Our entire permanent funds budget was essentially cut in 2011- 12, as part of the Student Affairs budget plan, although the funding was back -filled with funding from Student Heal th Center (via VCSA/AVC WHCS). However, this funding only covers our current staff salari es and benefits and does not provide any funds for casual staff, student staff, professional development/training or programming. We have been able to secure some SFAC support over the last few years (a total of $16,000 to support various programming efforts, 50% of the Wellness & Peer Education Program Manager position, and the 25% portion of the Registered Dietitian position). Temporary allocations, voluntary red uctions in salary and some savings from grants are the only operating resources available to support these expenses. We are currently using department reserves to support these operational costs, but expect those reserves to be depleted this year i f we con tinue with this model. This has resulted in the need to cut back staffing, rely heavily on student staff and volunteer peer educators, and to cut back on some programs. WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CENTER FOR STUDENT WELLNESS & HEALTH PROMOTION While we recognize that space is at a premium on campus, the CSWHP Wellness Room was r eallocated to another un it to convert it to an office. With students reporting stress being the #1 barrier to academic success, this is a critical n eed and resource for students. ASUC I asked CSWHP to create a wellness room space at their annual Reclaiming Mental Health conference this year and last year and it was heavily utilized and appreciated by students at the conference. We even collected data that supports this as a resource that students definitel y want back and would utilize. We hope that we are eventually given that space back for students to again utilize and build upon to support their mental and emotional well being. Having sufficient space for peers and stude nt interns can be a challenge. The cluster is discussing how the 520 sq . ft. space that it shares with CARE peers can be better divided. The combined budget and space challenges severely impact our ability to offer the programs and services th e students both want and need. We could do much more programming if we had the appropriate spaces (pr ogramming and training) to do so. Couple that with the fact that we don't have the budget to \"rent\" space as a department in the Student Center, Aldrich Park or other spaces on campus, we are incredibly limited on what we can offer as a department and have been relying on just meeting requests of student organizations, housing communities, campus departments and others than can provide/reserve the space we need to meet their program/service request. While we finally have a Registered Dietician/Nutritionist on staff now, it is a part -time position shared with Student Health (25% time in each department). This is still inadeq uate for a campus of our size and a major gap concern considering all of the food allergies, food insecurity concerns and fad diets that remain a major issue for UCI students , along with the disordered eating and more serious clinical concerns that students can face. XI. MISCELLANEOUS Not available XII. 2017-18 ACCOMPLISHMENTS Last year the CSWHP established a strong and unique partnership with the Program in Public Health to conduct focus groups on the mental health and wellness needs of the UCI students and to develop a Certificate Program in C ollegiate Health and Wellness. The Mental Health Research Team, which c o n s i s t e d o f t h e C S W H P A s s i s t a n t D i r ector Beth England- Mackie, Professor Dr. Zuzana Bic, 12 undergraduate students and 3 MPH students, collected both in -person and online responses from almost 500 students. This data will be used to enhance and expand programming and services to better meet the needs of UCI students. In addition, a proposal was submitted to the Curriculum Committee for the Program in Public Health for a Certificate of Completion in College Population Health Promotion and Wellness which was approved during Spring 2018. Student s will be able to begin the certificate program beginning Summer 2018. Upon completion, students will receive their certificate at the Undergraduate Honors Program . Emotional Well -Being Programs Manager Jasmine Blackburn, developed and taught a new 1.3 uni t class , Anteater Tough: Building Habits for Resilience, in collaboration with staff from the Counseling Center and Student Life & Leadership. Our Registered Dietician collaborated with the F RESH Basic Needs H ub to answer student nutrition questions on sit e, as well as providing nutrition workshops as pa rt of the Smart Eaters Series. Food insecurity is a huge problem across the UC system and helping empower students with nutrition knowledge that promotes healthy eating on a budget is vital to a student 's we ll being physically, mentally and academically. The Wellness & Peer Education Programs Manager Natalie D'Azzo taught several health and wellness 1.3 unit classes throughout the year - Adulting: Nutrition, Cooking and Self -Care Basics; Introduction WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CENTER FOR STUDENT WELLNESS & HEALTH PROMOTION to Health and Wellness; and Introduction to Mindfulness and Meditation. These courses were designed to help students build positive coping skills, reduce stress levels and develop a self -care plan. Staff members continued to be actively involved in leadership roles in the Healthy Campus Network Initiative, which was launched in 2016 -17 and funded by the UC Pre sident Janet Napolitano. Director Doug Everhart serves on the overall Advisory Group for the initiative; Assistant Director Beth England - Mackie serves as one of the leads on the Sexual Health Workgroup; and Wellness and Peer Education Programs Manager Natalie D'Azzo and Registered Dietician Jody Margolis serve on the Nutrition Workgroup. The CSWHP Peer Health Educator program continues to be an attra ctive oppor tunity for students. We had over 120 students apply this year, but were only able to select 28, with space and budget limitations. XIII. 2018-19 GOALS Address the budget/funding concerns and identify sustainable solutions Continue to seek and build partnerships with academic departments Seek to regain and make functional our Wellness Room space Continue to increase awareness and visibility of our center as a valuable student resource Continue to grow our outreach numbers by working smarter, not harder (i.e. same number of programs, services with larger and more intentional reach strategies). XIV. AWARDS Wellness & Peer Education Programs Manager Natalie D'Azzo received an Outstanding Supporters of Prevention Award from the Irvine Prevention Coalition. Beth England- Mack ie received a Student Affairs \"SPIRIT\" Award for her leadership in creating the Collegiate Health & Wellness Certificate Program in partnership with the Program in Public Health . XV. LEARNING OUTCOMES 2017-18 Updates Peer Health Education Program LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT By participating in our yearlong Peer Health Education Program and presenting health education workshops to peers, Peer Health Educators will increase their knowledge in the following areas: self - care, active listening, campus resources, the b ystander concept and program planning . Measured By: Pre and post surveys of student opinions, beliefs; interviews: one -on-one Results: The Peer Health Educators (PHEs) were given a pre -test in April of 2017 and post- test in June of 2018 in which the y rated their level of knowledge in the following topic areas: personal self -care techniques, techniques for active listening, campus resources, the bystander concept, planning a successful program and high performing characteristics. The pre -test was give n prior to the start of training and the post -test was administered at the end of the PHEs' one year of volunteer service. The results show tremendous growth from 2.30 to 3.0 at pre -test to 3.5 to 3.77 at post -test, on a scale of 1 (low) to 4 (high). The students increased their knowledge and skill set by participating in the 1.3 unit Peer Health Educator course in the 2017 spring quarter (facilitated by Wellness & Peer Education Programs Manager Natalie D'Azzo) where students are trained in the Bacchus Initiatives of NASPA Certified Peer Educator program. They all passed the exam to become Bacchus Certified Peer Educators. The course covers the topics that were assessed and much more, including the roles of a WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CENTER FOR STUDENT WELLNESS & HEALTH PROMOTION PHE, intersectionality, inclusive communication , referral skills, being a role model and public speaking. During the course, students also had the opportunity to practice creating and presenting their own group presentations on a wellness topic. Once the course is completed, students put their skills i nto practice for the next academic year. They represent our office and spread wellness education through presentations and large and small events. Their personal and professional growth continues throughout the year at biweekly training meetings. We are ve ry pleased with the growth of our students and moreover with their satisfaction in what this program provides them Use: Providing feedback to student/participant; reporting results Peer Health Educators LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT Sexual Health Peer Edu cators will improve presentation and communication skills as measured through direct assessment by the Sexual & Relationship Health Programs Manager . Measured By: Student performance (e.g., student oral presentation) rated without rubric. Results: Sexual Health (SH) Peer Educators are part of a larger group of Peer Health Educators but are trained on s exual and relationship health. During the Fall quarter they are trained by the Sexual Health Program Manager and other subject matter experts as they ty pically begin with on ly a basic level of knowledge. They also participate in a four -hour Professional Development Training by Planned Parenthood and receive a Certificate of Completion for this training. They learn about birth control, sexually transmitted diseases, sexual orientation, gender identity, consent and healthy relationships. The SH Peers observe the Program Manager presenting workshops in classrooms, housing communities and student organizations and begin to co -facil itate starting Winter quarter . Evaluations are given at each workshop and reviewed together in weekly meetings with a discussion of what went well, what could be modified and what they learned. In addition, the peers are given helpful feedback on ways to improve their communic ation a nd presentation skills. As we move into the Spring quarter, the SH Peers begin to facilitate the workshops on their own with some supervision by the Program Manager. In the beginning, the peers are not as confident (e.g. hesitate on explanations, speak t oo softly, defer questions to the Program Manager) as they are still learning the content area and working on their public speaking skills. By the end of the year, the SH Peers were able to facilitate the workshops on their own and answer approximately 90% of the students' questions accurately. Their knowledge of sexual health and relationships increased substantially as well as their confidence in delivering the workshops. Several of the SH Peers developed their own workshops and presented them several t imes during spring quarter. From Fall 2017 through Spring 2018, 36 workshops were conducted reaching a total of 2,180 undergraduate students.

IX. ADVISORY COMMITTEE UCI Counseling Center Governance X. MAJOR ISSUES Demand vs. Resources: Unlike the previous 3 years, in 2017 -18, the increased rate of student presentation for services surpassed our ability to provide initial appointments within our wait time goal of 10 business days for 9 weeks (7 of w hich were during fall quarter). We changed our clinical service offerings to emphasize access even further by increasing initial assessment appointments start ing in mid -fall, and we were able to average 4.7 business day wait time for initial assessment when looking across the complete year. Unfortunately, the shift of our clinical services capacity to WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES COUNSELING CENTER focus on initial appointments c reated a decrease in our follow -up service capacity, which was already challenged to serve all UCI students whose issues were appropriate for our scope of follow - up services . Staffing: Rapid center expansion and limited management and administrative resources has impeded ability to ke ep pace with the needed recruitment efforts Retention of Staff: High demand and acuity of services has contributed to retention challenges. Salaries: The Counseling Psychologists positions began the Union accretion process in 2017 (UPTE). To date, negotiations remain at an impasse system wide, which has negatively impacted staff salaries and prevented the Counseling Center fro m addressing salary inequities. Furthermore, UCI is losing staff to other UC and local university campuses that can offer more compe titive salaries. General Funding Allocations: Almost all increased funding over the past five years has been specificall y earmarked for salaries only. The UCI Counseling Center staff has rapidly grown, while the funding for supplies and expe nses remains al most unchanged. Efforts to increase this area of permanent funding have been unsuccessful causing us to rely heavily on carry forward money. Eventually, the need to keep up with general expenses (computers, EMR licensing fees, accommodation software, etc.) will far outpace the funding available even in carry forward money. Space: The UCI Counseling Center is currently divided into two locations: Main Building and Annex. The Annex location remains a \"rental\" agr eement with the Student Center. Initial agreeme nt indicated that Counseling Center could rent the space for 2- 3 years. We are now entering into the third year. Obtaining permanent space is critical to service the demands. UCOP Risk Initiatives and System wide Mandates: Continued rise in risk managemen t activities and expectations has dictated a need for counseling center management team to redirect attention to generating system wide reports, responding to calls for data, record standardization, case management, chart review processes, internal/externa l peer reviews and addressing privacy practices . XI. MISCELLANEOUS Rapid e xpansion of student population overall and self -supporting degree programs for students has created increased demands and complexities in determining student eligibility for services. Current national leadership has initiated executive orders and legislation that has negatively impacted marginalized student groups prevalent on our campus. Complexity of national and statewide privacy laws has highlighted the longstanding need for a system - wide attorney specializing in mental health law . Need and demand for increased services for high -risk populations has resulted in exploration of possible satellite locations and funding support. XII. 2017-18 ACCOMPLISHMENTS 16% increase in number of students served through clinical services in 2017 -18 when compar ed to 2016- 17 Established liaison relationship with Esports Partnering with Athletic Department to meet NCAA standards for mental health Purchased Therapist -assisted Online (TAO) to augment services an d help with demand Implemented Beyond Ring Road, a two -part panel and guest speakers program for graduating students Grant -funded electronic GIA was completed , 20 students participated in the pilot Implemented drop -in hours with one of our psychologists at the Cross -Cultural Center WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES COUNSELING CENTER Implemented drop -in hours with one of our psychologists at the Center for Black Cultures, Resources & Research UCI Student Staff were integrated into Counseling Center's staff recruiting process Introduced one -session counseling appointments to help manage demand during peak times XIII. 2018-19 GOALS Increase 1) clinical mental health services, and 2) outreach programs provided to the UCI campus community through added technology (i.e., TAO) Outreach efforts will include a focus on coll aboration with other campus units i.e. Law School, LGBT Resource Center, Esports Team, School of Social Ecology and CARE Office Implement varsity screener through Center for Collegiate Mental Health (CCMH) for student athletes UC Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) has reached a consensus to seek and maintain IACS accreditation. Due to shortages in budget, time and personnel, the application process has been put on hold sinc e 2007- 08, but remains a goal.

Part of STUDENT EMPLOYEE/PEER EDUCATOR Collaborative Assessment Measured By: Student product (e.g., portfolio, journal) rated using rubric; student performance (e.g., student oral presentation) rate d using rubric; Student product (e.g., portfolio, journal) rated without rubric Results: The rubrics were used on four occasions over the course of the Fall 2017 training of all peer coaches, where each peer coach rotated through each of the roles outli ned above. Rubrics assessed peer coaches' development of attentive listening skills and readiness to be assigned clients (students seeking coaching services) upon the start of Winter 2018 quarter. Peer coaches needed scores of 2 or better (on a 3-point rat ing scale) to be considered ready to see clients. 100% of peer coaches earned mean scores of 2.7 or better in four different role -plays.

With caseloads already over the advisable limit, the added burden and stress of requests continues to be a major concern. 16.2% increase in the number of s tudents requiring disability related accommodations - 1,252 in 2015 to 1,455 in 2016 Lack of access to faculty and teaching assistants to provide Ally training, Universal design and learning techniques and legal concerns regarding inclusive accessible clas sroom and course materials. Space will continue to be major issue for DSC. The current space is located in a substandard, modular building (trailer). As seen from the above increase in testing numbers, DSC will be required to utilize additional spaces for testing several times each quarter causing stress on students and staff . XI.

HISTORY In 1965, the University of California, Irvine admitted its first matriculating class. At that time, health services for students were housed in the Physical Education Department. The clinic consisted of four small examination rooms, a clinica l lab, x -ray, physical therapy and a pharmacy. The current Student Health Center building, completed in May 1968, was designed to serve 5,000 students. Over the years, we continue to evolve in order to meet the needs of the growing student population, now numbering over 30,000.

XV. LEARNING OUTCOMES 2017-18 Updates: UC mandated TB Screening and Immunization Compliance Program for all ne w incoming students PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY In an effort to i ncrease understanding among new incoming students of the public health importance of compliance with UC 's TB screening and immunization policy and to maximize overall compliance rates, SHC will : 1) continue to improve/simplify/enhance instructions and information provided to new students including production of instructional videos; revisions to the WH&CS student health portal and updates to the SHC website; 2) enhance collaboration with campus partners regarding communications regarding these admission health requirements; and 3) organize and plan seven \"Health Clearance & Immunization Fairs \" in an effort to accommodate students and increase compliance. To measure the success of this immunizatio n awareness initiative, the SHC will generate ongoing compliance reports through PnC to show compliance rates. These PnC reports will also allow SHC staff to see what areas of the compliance process students are failing to complete before the compliance de adlines. The goal for 2018 -19 is to have 90% of incoming students compliant by the deadline date of October 26, 2018 and 100% compliance by the start of the winter quarter . WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES STUDENT HEALTH CENTER Measured By: Other Results: (Learning outcomes were assessed by reviewing and calculating compliance data in the immunization compliance module of SHC 's electronic health record system Point and Click. The percentage of Fall 2017 incoming students who complied with UC 's mandated TB screening requirement increased from 31% in mid -August 2017 to 80% at the start of Winter recess in December 2017. This is an indication that increased messaging and communications to students and parents directly as well as to campus partners was, by and large, effective. However, the number of non -compl iant students was still excessive particularly in consideration of the fact that, starting in Fall of 2018, academic holds will be placed on non -compliant students preventing their enrollment in Winter quarter classes. With regard to immunization complianc e, the percentage of compliance increased from 18% in mid-August 2017 to 70% at the start of Winter recess. Although a significant increase was realized, the number of non -compliant students is still quite excessive. For Fall 2018, SHC has introduced sever al measures in an attempt to dramatically increase knowledge of and compliance with the requirements including, but not limited to, SIR attestations, Health Clearance Fairs and enhanced communications with all academic units . Use: Refining assessment to ols/LOs; refining program/program change; unit planning and/or budgeting; reporting results EAP Students will complete the clearance requirements before the 60 day deadline PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY In an effort to increase the number of EAP students th at are cleared before the academic year begins, the SHC will implement a multi -departmental approach that will hopefully streamline the EAP clearance process. With limited Mental Health (MH) appointment availability at the SHC, it would be beneficial to ex plore the option of possibly referring EAP students to an external Psychiatrist for clearance. Additionally, using the Counseling department as a resource to assist with evaluations will give students more options to obtain their clearance(s). Furthermore, SHC plans to pilot an online EAP clearance portal similar to what UCLA is currently using. This portal will allow students to self -disclose information, which will then be reviewed by RNs/NPs/MH providers, thus eliminating the need for all clearances to b e conducted on -site and in person. Student learning success will be quantified by measuring the number of EAPs completed before the deadline vs the number of EAPs completed after the deadline. The results will then be analyzed against the number of EAP stu dents requesting clearance vs the actual number of EAP who were granted clearance by SHC . Measured By: Interviews: one -on-one; other Results: Learning outcomes were assessed by reviewing and calculating clinical data from SHC's electronic health reco rd system, Point and Click, as well as from reviewing forms presented and/or completed by students during health clearance examinations. During FY 2017 -18 and following enhanced communications efforts with the EAP program, nursing staff at SHC reviewed and tracked the amount of time between the dates on which EAP students made an appointment to obtain travel health clearances and the ac tual completion of clearances. The goal was to increase the percentage of EAP students who made appointments for and comple ted their travel health clearance requirements from within sixty days of travel to prior to sixty days before their travel. Three hundred eighteen EAP students were tracked. Nurses reported that the demand for appointments and the associated deadlines to c omplete WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES STUDENT HEALTH CENTER clearances varied significantly as they were destination specific. This made it very difficult to effectively manage scheduling of clinic visits for EAP clearances without the benefit of a more formal process to alert SHC staff well in advance of t he deadline associated with any particular destination. The review of data between July and October 2017 revealed that between the months of July to October 2017, EAP students, on average, obtained their travel health clearances in July 2.8 months prior t o date of departure. In October, this number had increased to 3.35 months prior to date of departure. This reflects an increase of 19.6% in terms of the number of days prior to date of departure that clearances were obtained. Although EAP students are gene rally very timely in obtaining their travel health clearances and within the guidelines of at least sixty days prior to date of departure, challenges remain particularly for those students who receive mental health services. In FY 2018 -19, SHC intends to focus on additional measures to streamline the clearance process including online screening in order to reduce the number of onsite visits necessary for students to obtain health clearances . Use: Refining assessment tools/LOs; providing feedback to stude nt/participant; refining program/program changes; unit planning and/or budgeting ; reporting results Diabetes education program for students who are identified as at risk of developing diabetes PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY Students identified at risk for de veloping diabetes by providers will be referred to a 1:1 diabetes education program where they will learn about diabetes, what puts them at risk for developing the disease and strategies for prevention and management. During the course of this educational program, students can develop their own individualized diabetes management plans to include fitness programs, nutritional seminars, lifestyle changes, etc. Providers will be directly involved in the planning process to ensure that the student has as much support as possible in order for their diabetes management plan(s) to be successful . Measured By: Interviews: one -on-one, Other Results: The learning outcome was assessed by a retrospective study. Medical records of 104 patients, referred to nutriti onal counseling because they had a BMI (Body Mass Index) of 30 or greater, were randomly selected and reviewed to ascertain clinical results following nutritional counseling . Obesity is defined as a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or greater. Complications of obesity include hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, osteoarthritis, fatty liver, sleep apnea, acid reflux, reduced physical mobility, chronic back pain and cancers of breast, endometrium, pancreas, kidney, gallbladder, thyroid and colon. As a nation, ne arly 38% of US adults are obese (NHANES 2013 -14). In California, the rate of adult obesity is 25%. Among the Californians, obesity rates for age 18 -25 is 14.5%, age 26 -44 is 25.4%, and age 46 -64 is 29.6% ( stateofobesity.org/adult -obesity/). The increasing trend of obesity rates among the age groups is alarming. This indicates intervention at a younger age is warranted to combat this epidemic. Common obesity interventions include physical activity, medical treatment and nutritional counseling. Of these inter ventions, the knowledge of healthy eating and proper food choices is the cornerstone of obesity intervention and prevention strategy. WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES STUDENT HEALTH CENTER In 2017 -18 providers at the Student Health Center made a conscious effort to refer students with a BMI of 30 or greater to nutritional counseling. By learning and acquiring the knowledge of healthy eating with nutritional counseling, the students should be better equipped to manage their food choices and weights to achieve the desirable effect of weight loss. This retrospec tive chart review examined the learning outcome of nutritional counseling on weight changes among the studen ts with a BMI of 30 and above. The control group included students who have a BMI of 30 or greater but never had nutritional counseling. The experim ental group included students who had a BMI of 30 or greater and had at least one visit with our nutritionist for a comprehensive nutritional counseling. Both groups must had subsequent visits between the ranges of 2\u00bd to 7 months, with weights documented a t the Student Health Center. Results Control Group (no nutritional counseling; 47 charts randomly selected): Gained Weight: 36/46=76.6% No Lost Weight: 6/47=12.8% Experimental Group nutritional counseling; charts reviewed Gained Weight: 19/57=33.3% No Change: 5/57=5.3% Lost Weight: 35/57=61.4% This retrospective chart review of the learning outcome has shown that with nutritional counseling, students with obesity were much more likely to have success with weight loss (6 1.4% vs. 12.8%). This study demonstrated the value of nutritional counseling to combat obesity in a college health setting. Student Health Center providers will continue to refer students with obesity for nutritional counseling. College is where students c an acquire lifelong knowledge that can impact thei r future lives. For the students who have struggled with obesity, nutritional counseling can be life changing. The availability of quality nutritional counseling and continuous funding for such is definitel y warranted in a college setting based on this study . Use: Providing feedback to student/participant; refining program/program changes; reporting results 2018-19 Health clearances for Education Abroad Program (EAP) student s PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY Student Health Center (SHC) will assess the learning of students who are registered in the EAP study abroad program and who require health clearances from SHC by published deadline dates in order for the student to travel abroad. Specifically, EAP students will learn, be aware of and become knowledgeable regarding the following: 1. The specific health clearance requirements pertaining to the country to which the student is traveling. 2. The current public health issues/alerts that pertain to the country and/or re gion to which student will be traveling. 3. The deadline dates for compliance to ensure that the student's EAP program is not adversely impacted (e.g., cancelled or delayed). WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES STUDENT HEALTH CENTER 4. The importance of effective planning for travel abroad related to health care includ ing timely submission of health -related information to SHC; scheduling of appointments well in advance; and awareness of available health care resources in the country/region to which the student is traveling. Program SHC will implement a modified EAP heal th clearance program in conjunction with the EAP, its students and other affected departments. The revised program is intended to: 1. Increase student access by streamlining the health clearance process, including online clearances, so that more students can obtain clearances without the necessity of an onsite clinic visit. 2. Increase communications with students, EAP department staff and other affected campus departmental staff regarding the modified process to ensure that all parties are fully aware of the hea lth clearance requirements, deadlines, process, etc... 3. Ensure that a minimum of 95% of EAP students complete the requirements and obtain clearances by the published deadline date. Assessment Student learning will be shown by: 1. Successful completion of the task of obtaining health clearances by published deadline dates by at least 95% of EAP students. 2. EAP students will be receive pre - and post -program tests in order to demonstrate their knowledge regarding country -specific travel, public health and health cle arance requirements. 3. 3. Students who have scheduled in -person appointments and/or requested online clearances with nurses and/or providers will demonstrate awareness and knowledge regarding country -specific travel, public health and health clearance requir ements following their consultations .

Incoming students will learn: 1. The public health importance of compliance with these requirements as well as t he potential impact of non -compliance upon the entire campus community. 2. How to comply with these requirements. 3. The importance of being aware of all non -academic conditions of admission to the university. 4. The repercussions for non -compliance. WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES STUDENT HEALTH CENTER Program UCI's Student Health Center administers a structured TB Screening/Immunizations Compliance Program that requires actions to be taken by all incoming students by published deadline dates in order to be in compliance and to avoid the application of academic holds that prevent class enrollment. Assessment Student learning will be shown by: 1. Compliance rate for incoming students will be at least 90% by the deadline date (i.e., 4th Friday of October). 2. 100% of non -compliant students will have met the requirements by the start of the Winter Recess. 3. Students must complete the task of completing an online TB screening questionnaire; self - enter immunization dates online; and upload copies of immunization records online in order to be deemed \"compliant.\" 4. A random, represent ative sample of incoming students will receive tests following the submission of their Statement of Intent to Register (SIR) and prior to the start of the Fall quarter demonstrating awareness and knowledge of these requirements and to help SHC assess the e ffectiveness of the messaging and communications efforts during the pre - orientation and post -orientation periods. 5. 5. Point and Click (PnC), the secure electronic health record utilized by SHC, is the repository for students' health information including TB screening and Immunization records. PnC also serves as the tool for determining student compliance with these requirements .
