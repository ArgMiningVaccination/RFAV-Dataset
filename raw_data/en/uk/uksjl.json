But what does this have to do with cooking, you may ask? Well, it's particularly pertinent to nonstick cookware. In the 1940s, nonstick pans entered the market with coatings produced to resist grease, oil, and water. The chemicals that made this possible fall under the umbrella of PFAS and a subset of PFAS are polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and (perfluorooctanoic acid) PFOA, which are commonly referred to as Teflon. With new research linking these chemicals to lowering immunity in children, kidney disease, thyroid disease, and other health concerns, the use of PFOAs has been [phased out of many production lines](https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/whatwestudy/assessments/noncancer/completed/pfoa#:~:text=PFOS%20was%20phased%20out%20of,at%20the%20end%20of%202015.) over the past decade (though [this is still a work in progress](https://www.fda.gov/food/environmental-contaminants-food/and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas)). While many brands today claim their cookware is free of these chemicals, there are more coatings than just Teflon, so even if your sparkly new nonstick pan says that it's PTFE- or PFOA-free, it may still contain another chemical from the PFAS family. But many people also really love nonstick pans (we get it, they're great for scrambled eggs!). What's a cook to do then? The good news is, there are a myriad of alternatives to nonstick that are non-toxic\u2014including ceramic pans\u2014let's dive in. What Does Non-Toxic Cookware Mean? Non-toxic cookware is any cookware made without the use of nonstick coatings, like PFAS. This means any cookware that is made of stainless steel, cast iron, or carbon steel\u2014essentially any cookware that doesn't have a coating\u2014are the least toxic products available on the market. While there may be more of a learning curve when using these types of cookware, you'll likely have less to worry about in the long run when it comes to health and environmental hazards. Is Ceramic Cookware Non-Toxic? Ceramic cookware is often offered as a non-toxic option for cooks who want a nonstick pot or pan. Ceramic pots and pans are coated with thin layers of silica, which is made from sand. This creates a smooth, impervious surface that is \"nonstick.\" While they're generally free of PFOA or PTFE, they might falter when it comes to durability. In order to keep ceramic cookware in good condition, it's important to cook at the suggested temperatures, avoid temperature shocks (like putting a scalding hot pan under cold water), and never use metal utensils on the surface. In our [nonstick vs. ceramic skillets](https://www.seriouseats.com/nonstick-vs-ceramic-skillets-7110252) deep dive, we simply couldn't land on one side or the other as being better; at the end of the day, ceramic cookware isn't perfect, but it could ease concerns about off-gassing or chemical migration. The Best Non-Toxic Cookware When you're looking at non-toxic cookware without any coating, your best choices include stainless steel, (enameled) cast iron, or carbon steel. The good news is, these are all already pots and pans we've tested, recommend, and use on a daily basis.

It had impeccably even heating and was comfortable to hold and maneuver. Stainless steel isn't nonstick in the same way that a nonstick skillet is, so it can take some getting used to if you're new to it. To prevent sticking, we recommend heating the skillet over high heat before adding oil, then adding your food once the oil is shimmering.

The Best Carbon Steel Pan Mauviel M'Steel Black Carbon Natural Nonstick Frying Pan With Iron Handle A cousin to cast iron, carbon steel cookware is a mixture of carbon and iron.

Non-toxic cookware doesn't have chemicals that are found in traditional nonstick cookware, such as PFOA or PTFE, making them generally safer to use without fear of off-gassing and overall health or environmental impact. However, because non-toxic cookware\u2014such as stainless steel, cast iron, or carbon steel\u2014doesn't have a nonstick coating, more care is necessary to keep them in good shape. For example, cast iron and carbon steel must go through a seasoning process before you'll see nonstick properties with them. While some come pre-seasoned, it's important to know how to best take care of them to keep the seasoning. See our pieces on [how to season carbon steel](https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-season-carbon-steel-pans) and [how to care for cast iron](https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-clean-maintain-cast-iron-pan-skillet-cookware) for more detailed guidance. Is stainless steel cookware non-toxic? Yes, stainless cookware is non-toxic since it doesn't have a coating. Therefore, you don't have to worry about chemicals like PFOA or PTFE when cooking with it. Is there anything I should avoid with cast iron and carbon steel cookware? Yes, we recommend that you don't cook acidic foods in cast iron and carbon steel for an extended amount of time (such as a low-and-slow simmered tomato sauce) since it could "}
