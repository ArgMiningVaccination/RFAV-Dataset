The much-trumpeted Russian drug was registered after just 42 days of research, Fontanka news agency says - and its effectiveness is said to be 'unknown'. One of the documents submitted for registration says that 'no clinical studies have been conducted to study the epidemiological effectiveness,' despite Putin's claims that the vaccine has passed 'all the necessary tests'. There are also questions about the vaccine's ability to create sufficient antibodies, after Putin said his own daughter had already developed them after being injected. Vladimir Putin claims Russia has a coronavirus vaccine and says one of his daughters has already been injected - prompting widespread scepticism A researcher in Russia works with a coronavirus vaccine at the Nikolai Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology in Moscow last week Russia has made the vaccine race a matter of national prestige and has named the product 'Sputnik V' after the former Soviet space satellites, prompting fears that safety will be compromised for the sake of Russia's image. Scientists yesterday criticised Putin for the 'reckless and foolish' move which they say could make the pandemic worse if the vaccine proves dangerous or ineffective. While Putin said his daughter had suffered no side effects worse than a high temperature, Fontanka claimed there were a long list of 'adverse events' (AEs) which occurred 'frequently and very often'. 'It is not possible to more accurately determine the incidence of AEs due to the limited sample of study participants,' said the Gamaleya Research Institute which produced the vaccine. In the 38 healthy adult human volunteers who were tested, 144 separate adverse events were recorded, it was reported. Most passed 'without consequences', but on the 42nd day of the study, 31 of these side-effects were still ongoing. The outcome of 27 adverse events were said to be still unknown to the developer. Among the side effects are swelling, pain, hyperthermia - a high body temperature - and itching at the place of injection. Common manifestations were reported as physical weakness or lack of energy, malaise, fever, decreased appetite, headaches, diarrhoea, nasal congestion, a sore throat, and runny nose. Tests appeared to show that on the 42nd day after vaccination, volunteers had antibodies at below the average levels. Putin said one of his daughters Maria (left) and Katerina (right) had been injected with a coronavirus vaccine. Reports in Russia say it was the younger Katerina who was inoculated Medical workers in protective gear prepare to draw blood from volunteers participating in a trial of a coronavirus vaccine at the Budenko Main Military Hospital outside Moscow The vaccine is also not permitted for those under 18 or over 60 due to lack of research so far on its impact. It is not recommended for pregnant and lactating women because its 'efficacy and safety have not been studied.' Nor have the vaccine's interaction with other drugs and its effect on the ability to drive vehicles been studied. It should be used with 'caution' for those with a range of conditions including chronic diseases of the kidneys and liver, diabetes, epilepsy, and people with a history of strokes, diseases of the cardiovascular system, immunodeficiency, autoimmune diseases, allergic reactions, atopy, and eczema. Another warning read: 'There are no specific antidotes to the drug. The risk of overdose is extremely low as the vaccination will be administered by trained health personnel. 'But in case of an accidental overdose, toxic and allergic reactions are possible.' The vaccine is also extremely sensitive to external influences and should be stored frozen, at a temperature not higher than -18C, the documents say. Before use, it must be kept at room temperature, but not longer than 30 minutes. Before the injection - it should be mixed by gently shaking. The head of the Gamaleya Institute, Alexander Gintsburg, told Interfax:'When we finish the post-registration phase, which we are just starting now, we are legally entitled to submit documents to test this vaccine on children.' But Fontanka said the Gamaleya documentation 'does not look as encouraging as the statements of Vladimir Putin and Minister of Health Mikhail Murashko'. Russia has suffered nearly 900,000 coronavirus cases, but the daily infection rate has been slowly falling for several months Russia has suffered 15,131 deaths in the pandemic and frequently sees more than 100 new fatalities per day Today's disclosures follow a wave of criticism from scientists over the haste with which is has been registered, before it has undergone so-called Phase III trials. 'Fast-tracked approval will not make Russia the leader in the race, it will just expose consumers of the vaccine to unnecessary danger,' said Russia's Association of Clinical Trials Organisations. Putin said one of his daughters had taken the vaccine. She had a temperature of 38C on the day of the first vaccine injection, and this dropped to 37C a day later, he said. 'She's feeling well and has a high number of antibodies,' he boasted. Professor Francois Balloux of University College London's Genetics Institute, slammed the Russian move. 'This is a reckless and foolish decision,' he said. 'Mass vaccination with an improperly tested vaccine is unethical.' He warned: 'Any problem with the Russian vaccination campaign would be disastrous both through its negative effects on health, but also because it would further set back the acceptance of vaccines in the population.' German health minister Jens Spahn said today that Russia's vaccine had not been sufficiently tested. 'It can be dangerous to start vaccinating millions, if not billions, of people too early because it could pretty much kill the acceptance of vaccination if it goes wrong, so I'm very sceptical about what's going on in Russia,' Spahn told German radio. 'I would be pleased if we had an initial, good vaccine but based on everything we know - and that's the fundamental problem, namely that the Russians aren't telling us much - this has not been sufficiently tested,' he added. 'It's not about being first somehow - it's about having an effective, tested and therefore safe vaccine,' he said. Putin has two adult daughters and he did not specify which one was vaccinated, but Otkrytie Media reported it was Ekaterina - known as Katerina - Tikhonova. She had the vaccination at a very early stage of its development, it was claimed. Katerina, 33, uses the surname of her maternal grandmother, which for many years hid her identity as Putin's daughter. The former acrobatic dancer holds a doctorate from prestigious Moscow State University after completing a study on helping cosmonauts and pilots to orientate themselves in difficult conditions. Russia's coronavirus 'vaccine' announced by Vladimir Putin is shrouded in secrecy - but don't dismiss it just yet, writes BEN SPENCER By Ben Spencer for the Daily Mail [Russia](/news/russia/index.html)'s claims to have created the world's first [coronavirus vaccine](/sciencetech/coronavirus-vaccine-research/index.html) should not be dismissed out of hand. The country has a proud history of scientific achievements - it sent the first human into space and for decades led the world in the fields of engineering, mathematics and physics. It also has a strong track record in producing reliable vaccines - notably for [Ebola](/news/ebola/index.html) and yellow fever - and the Moscow institution behind the new jab, the Gamaleya Research Institute, is a long-established and well known research centre. But it is hard to judge the safety and efficacy of the vaccine because very little information has been made available. The teams behind experimental Covid vaccines in Oxford, the United States and China have all published detailed results of their trials at every stage. The Russian team, however, have given little away. Russia has a strong track record in producing reliable vaccines - notably for Ebola and yellow fever - and the Moscow institution behind the new jab, the Gamaleya Research Institute (employee working with a coronavirus vaccine at the Institute pictured), is a long-established and well known research centre Photo provided by Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) shows a researcher working in a laboratory of the Gamaleya Scientific Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology in Moscow, Russia, Aug. 6, 2020, as Russia claims to have developed Covid-19 vaccine The scant details suggest it is an adenovirus vector vaccine - a similar type to those being developed in Oxford and elsewhere. These contain a weakened version of the common cold virus that has been genetically changed to trigger the production of immune cells - antibodies and T-cells. Early results from China and Oxford suggest this is a sound approach - it is likely to produce an immune response with few side-effects - but so far the Russian jab has been tested on only 38 people. Pictured: Vladimir Putin's daughter, Katerina Tikhonova, who he claims was given the vaccine A properly conducted, randomised control trial, involving hundreds if not thousands of people, is vital to prove it is safe and works. Rushing into a mass vaccination programme without this step would be foolhardy and dangerous. If patients are harmed by the jab before it passes further tests it will undermine already fragile confidence in vaccines. The good news is that it would be a relatively quick process for Russia to prove the vaccine works. The Oxford University team is unlikely to get a definitive result any time soon because Covid-19 incidence has dwindled. Despite a study involving 10,000 Britons, they have been forced to test their jab in Brazil instead. Russia still has high coronavirus infection rates and scientists estimate it would take just two months for them to prove the vaccine is safe and effective.
