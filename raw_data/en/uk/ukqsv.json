Crystal Light natural class action overview: - Who: A Crystal Light consumer is suing Kraft Heinz. - Why: The plaintiff says the Crystal Light beverages are falsely marketed as being \"all natural.\" - Where: The Crystal Light natural class action was filed in a California federal court. A Crystal Light consumer is suing two Kraft Heinz companies, alleging their Crystal Light beverages are falsely marketed as being \"all natural,\" when they contain artificial flavors. Plaintiff Peggy Tatum filed the class action complaint against The Kraft Heinz Company and Kraft Heinz Foods Company LLC (Kraft Heinz) Nov. 17 in a California federal court, alleging violations of state and federal consumer laws. Kraft Heinz manufactures and sells a wide variety of flavored drink mixes under the \"Crystal Light\" brand, the lawsuit states. According to the complaint, Kraft Heinz labels its Crystal Light drink mixes as if they are solely naturally flavored, however at least 17 Crystal Light varieties contain \"an undisclosed artificial flavor.\" \"The Products' front-of-package labels expressly claim that they are flavored with 'Natural flavor' or 'Natural flavor with other natural flavor' alongside the names and pictorial representations of fruits and berries,\" the lawsuit states. \"The Products' labels omit all the required artificial-flavor disclosures. Defendants' on-line advertising is equally misleading.\" Crystal Light packing is intentionally deceptive, lawsuit alleges Kraft Heinz intentionally conceals from consumers the fact that the products contain artificial flavoring chemicals that simulate the advertised natural flavors, the lawsuit alleges. \"Because these labels conceal the fact that the Products are made with artificial flavors, that labeling is false and misleading and the Products are misbranded under federal and state law.\" The marketing leads consumers to believe they are buying and paying a premium price for a premium all-natural product, when they are not, the lawsuit adds. The Crystal Light lawsuit seeks to represent all U.S. citizens who purchased the Crystal Light products in the United States on or after Jan. 1, 2016, plus a California subclass. Tatum is suing for violations of state consumer laws, breach of warranty, negligent misrepresentation and fraud by omission. She seeks certification of the class action, damages, fees, costs and a jury trial. In 2019, the Kraft Heinz Company was [hit with a class action lawsuit](https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/consumer-products/beverages/crystal-light-false-ad-class-action-lawsuit-survives-dismissal/) from customers who claimed the company's use of the artificial flavoring DL-malic acid in Crystal Light meant that the products were falsely advertised.
