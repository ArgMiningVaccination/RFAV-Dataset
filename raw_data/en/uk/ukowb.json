Shrouded in mystery, this expanse of the Himalayas is the custodian of spirituality that gods and humans share and celebrate together. The presiding deity of the valley, Hidimba\u2014a woman who, through her self-effort, arose as a goddess\u2014is testimony that all of us have the potential to transcend our limitations and reclaim our divine nature in this lifetime. This is what the valley stands for. Manali and the surrounding peaks and valleys are the cornerstone of the Himalayan Tradition. This is the home of the Chintapurni, Jwalamukhi, Shikari Devi, and great masters Vashishta, Lomas, Markandeya, Vyasa, and Parashurama. Pilgrimage to this land means the pilgrimage to the 5,000-year-old Tradition and basking in the love, wisdom, protection, and guidance of these divinities and the Sages. These divinities and masters together form the living body of tantra, more precisely, the Sri Vidya Tradition of tantra. Dharamasala The excursion begins in Dharamasala, \"house of dharma\", the seat of His Holiness the Dalai Lama. For untold ages, this place has been associated with Patanjali (known in the Tibetan tradition as Nagpa), as even today there stands a beautiful shrine locally known as Bhasuki Naga. In Dharamasala, you'll experience a mini-Tibet as well as pollination of Indian and Tibetan cultures. Mandi From Mandi we will visit two beautiful bodies of water\u2014Rewalsar Lake and Prashar Lake. Like Lake Manasarovar in Tibet, Rewalsar is one of the most sacred lakes and is surrounded by Hindu, Sikh, and Buddhist shrines and monasteries. In the Tradition of the Himalayan Sages, this place is of special importance, for here, Padmasambhava received the blessings of Hayagriva and attained oneness with Vajravarahi. And this is where the Sage Lomas conquered old age, disease, and death. Sitting at 9,000ft, Prashar Lake is home to the Pagoda style Prashar Temple built in the 14th century in honor of the sage Prashar who meditated here. The emerald lake is surrounded by snow-capped peaks and green pastures. Manali Valley Manali is one of the most beautiful valleys in the Himalayas. According to legend, after the epic flood receded, this is where Manu and the seven sages envisioned how to reintroduce the human race and establish law and order for a sustainable civilization. Thus this valley came to be known as Manvalaya, the home of Manu or the home of humans, which later evolved into the word Manali. Even though this valley is replete with shrines and sacred sites, we'll have the special privilege of visiting Hidimba and Tripura Sundari temples. Key Shrines Hidimba Hidimba is the queen goddess of this valley. She was of low birth, and yet through practice and unshakable resolve, she cultivated the qualities and powers coveted by great adepts; played a pivotal role in shaping humanity; and at death, joined the circle of celestial beings. No pilgrimage or act of spirituality in this valley is complete without paying homage to her. Tripura Sundari All tantric practices are part of the infinitely vast vortex of Sri Vidya. Our pilgrimage ends as we connect ourselves with this sublime Divine Force and imbibe the energy we individually and collectively need to transcend pervasive fear and confusion ruling our world. Vajreshwari Vajreshwari is one of the tantric goddesses respected equally in Indian and Tibetan spirituality, and resides in the inner kora of Sri Chakra. She is the goddess of lasting resolution, vitality, strength, and stamina\u2014in brief, kriya shakti, the power of action. We will also be visiting... - Chamunda Devi: Located at the bank of the Bana Ganga, this shrine houses one of the most vibrant forms of tantric goddesses, Chamunda. Here, the scripture Durga Saptashati and practice related to the Navarna mantra come to life provided we have cultivated enough sensitivity to feel it. This is the place where Nandi, the son of the sage Shilada, attained immortality and became Rudra Shiva. Experience the energy in the cave where Nandi became Shiva. - Chintapurni: Literally, Chintapurni means the fulfiller of desires, and is another name for Kameshvari. Like Vajreshwari, she resides in the inner kora of Sri Chakra. In our Tradition, this goddess is often worshipped as Chinnamasta and as such, she is an embodiment of boundless compassion, love, and forgiveness. - Jwalamukhi: Jwalamukhi is the fire goddess. This shrine consists of natural flames emerging from the ground, and the goddess is worshipped in these flames. On rare occasions, there are more than twelve flames, but most often, five to seven flames are visible. This is one of the most miraculous and powerful shrines in the western Himalayas, and for a long time, has been a stronghold of the sadhus of the Natha tradition. |Day 1, March 5||Dharamshala [6,831ft]: Arrive at Dharamshala airport and transfer as a group to hotel.
