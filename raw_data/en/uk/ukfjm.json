General Guideline Principles The principles summarized in this section are key to the intended application of the New York State Medical Treatment Guidelines (MTG) and are applicable to all Workers' Compensation Medical Treatment Guidelines. A.1 Medical Care Medical care and treatm ent required as a result of a work -related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities with a focus on a return to work, while striving to restore the patient's health to its pre -injury status in so far as is feasible. A.2 Rendering Of Medical Services Any medical provider rendering services to a workers' compensation patient must utilize the Treatment Guidelines as provided for with respect to all work -related injuries and/or illnesse s. A.3 Positive Patient Response Positive results are defined primarily as functional gains which can be objectively measured. Objective functional gains include, but are not limited to, positional tolerances, range of m otion, strength, endurance, activities of daily living (ADL), cognition, psychological behavior, and efficiency/velocity measures which can be quantified. Subjective reports of pain and function may be considered and given relative weight when the pain has anatomic and physiologic correlation in proportion to the injury. A.4 Re-Evaluate Treatment If a given treatment or modality is not producing positive results within a well -defined timeframe, the provider should either mod ify or discontinue the treatment regime. The provider should evaluate the efficacy of the treatment or modality 2 to 3 weeks after the initial visit and 3 to 4 weeks thereafter. These timeframes may be slightly longer in the context of conditions that are inherently mental health issues, and shorter for other non-musculoskeletal medical conditions (e.g. pulmonary, dermatologic etc.). Recognition that treatment failure is at times attributable to an incorrect diagnosis a failure to respond should prompt the clinician to reconsider the diagnosis in the event of an unexpected poor response to an otherwise rational intervention. A.5 Education Education of the patient and family, as well as the employer, insurer, policy makers and the commun ity should be a primary emphasis in the treatment of work -related injury or illness. Practitioners should develop and implement effective educational strategies and skills. An education -based paradigm should always start with communication providing reassu ring information to the patient. No treatment plan is complete without addressing issues of individual and/or group patient education as a means of facilitating self -management of symptoms and prevention of future injury. NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 10 Timeframes A.6 Acuity Acute, Subacute and Chronic are generally defined as timeframes for disease stages: Acute - Less than one month Subacute - One to three month Chronic - greater than three months A.7 Initial Evaluation Initial evaluation refers to the acute timeframe foll owing an injury and is not used to define when a given physician first evaluates an injured worker (initial encounter) in an office or clinical setting. A.8 Diagnostic Time Frames Diagnostic time frames for conducting diagnostic testing commence on the date of injury. Clinical judgment may substantiate the need to accelerate or decelerate the time frames discussed in this document. A.9 Treatment Time Frames Treatment time frames for specific interventions commence once treatments have been initiated, not on the date of injury. It is recognized that treatment duration may be impacted by disease process and severity, patient compliance, as well as avail ability of services. Clinical judgment may substantiate the need to accelerate or decelerate the time frames discussed in this document. A.10 Delayed Recovery For those patients who fail to make expected progress 6 -12 weeks after an injury and whose subjective symptoms do not correlate with objective signs and tests, reexamination in order to confirm the accuracy of the diagnosis and re -evaluation of the treatment program should be performed. When addressing a clinical issue that is not inherently a mental health issue, assessment for potential barriers to recovery (yellow flags/psychological issues) should be ongoing throughout the care of the patient. At 6 -12 weeks, alternate treatment programs, including formal psychological or psychosocial evaluation should be considered. Clinicians must be vigilant for any pre-existing mental health issues or subsequent, consequential mental health issues that may be impacting recovery. For issues that are clearly and inherently mental health issues from the outset (i.e. when it is evident that there is an underlying, work - related, mental health disorder as part of the claim at issue), referral to a mental health provider can and should occur much sooner. Referrals to mental health providers fo r the evaluation and management of delayed recovery do not indicate or require the establishment of a psychiatric or psychological condition. The evaluation and management of delayed recovery does not require the establishment of a psychiatric or psycholog ical claim. Treatment Approaches A.11 Active Interventions NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 11 Active interventions emphasizing patient responsibility, such as therapeutic exercise and/or functional treatment, are generally emphasized over passive modalities, especially as treatment progresses. Generally, passive and palliative interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active rehabilitation program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. A.12 Active Therapeutic Exercise Program Active therapeutic exercise program goals should incorporate patient strength, endurance, flexibility, range of motion, sensory integration, coordination, cognition and behavior (when at issue) and education as clinically indicated. This includes functional application in vocational or community settings. A.13 Diagnostic Imaging And Testing Procedures Clinical information obtained by history taking and physical examination should be the basis for selection of i maging procedures and interpretation of results. All diagnostic procedures have characteristic specificities and sensitivities for various diagnoses. Usually, selection of one procedure over others depends upon various factors, which may include: relative diagnostic value; risk/benefit profile of the procedure; availability of technology; a patient's tolerance; and/or the treating practitioner's familiarity with the procedure. When a diagnostic procedure, in conjunction with clinical information, provides sufficient information to establish an accurate diagnosis, a second diagnostic procedure is not required. However, a subsequent diagnostic procedure including a repeat of the original (same) procedure can be performed, when the specialty physician (e.g. ph ysiatrist, sports medicine physician or other appropriate specialist) radiologist or surgeon documents that the initial study was of inadequate quality to make a diagnosis. Therefore, in such circumstances, a repeat or complementary diagnostic procedure is permissible under the MTG. It is recognized that repeat imaging studies and other tests may be warranted by the clinical course and/or to follow the progress of treatment in some cases. It may be of value to repeat diagnostic procedures (e.g., imaging s tudies) during the course of care to reassess or stage the pathology when there is progression of symptoms or findings, prior to surgical interventions and/or therapeutic injections when clinically indicated, and post -operatively to follow the healing proc ess. Regarding serial imaging, (including x-rays, but particularly CT scans), it must be recognized that repeat procedures result in an increase in cumulative radiation dose and associated risks. A given diagnostic imaging procedure may provide the same o r distinctive information as obtained by other procedures. Therefore, prudent choice of procedures(s) for a single diagnostic procedure, a complementary procedure in combination with other procedures(s), or a proper sequential order in multiple procedures will ensure maximum diagnostic accuracy, minimize the likelihood of adverse effect on patients, and promote efficiency by avoiding duplication or redundancy . A.14 Surgical Interventions Consideration of surgery should be wi thin the context of expected functional outcome. The concept of \"cure\" with respect to surgical treatment by itself is generally a misnomer. All operative interventions must be based upon positive correlation of NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 12 clinical findings, clinical course and imagi ng and other diagnostic tests. A comprehensive assimilation of these factors must lead to a specific diagnosis with positive identification of pathologic condition(s). For surgery to be performed to treat pain, there must be clear correlation between the pain symptoms and objective evidence of its cause. In all cases, shared decision making with the patient is advised. The patient should be given the opportunity to understand the pros and cons of surgery, potential for rehabilitation as an alternative whe re applicable, evidence -based outcomes, and specific surgical experience. A.15 Pre -Authorization All diagnostic imaging, testing procedures, non -surgical and surgical therapeutic procedures, and other therapeutics within the cri teria of the Medical Treatment Guidelines and based on a correct application of the Medical Treatment Guidelines are considered authorized, with the exception of the procedures listed in section 324.3(1)(a) of Title 12 NYCRR. These are not included on the list of pre -authorized procedures. Providers who want to perform one of these procedures must request pre -authorization from the carrier before performing the procedure. Second or subsequent procedures (the repeat performance of a surgical procedure due to failure of, or incomplete success from the same surgical procedure performed earlier, if the Medical Treatment Guidelines do not specifically address multiple procedures) also require pre -authorization. A.16 Psychological/Psychiatric Evaluations In select patients, mental health evaluations are essential to make, secure or confirm a diagnosis. Of course, the extent and duration of evaluations and/or interventions by mental health professionals may vary, particularly based on whether: the underlying clinical issue in the claim is inherently a mental health issue; or there is a mental health issue that is secondary or consequential to the medical injury or illness that is at issue in the claim in question; or there is a pre -existing, unrelated mental health issue that has been made worse by, or is impeding the recovery from (or both) the medical injury or illness that is at issue in the claim in question. Tests of psychological function or psycho metric testing, when indicated, can be a valuable component of the psychological evaluation in identifying associated psychological, personality and psychosocial issues. Although these instruments may suggest a diagnosis, neither screening nor psychometric tests are capable of making a diagnosis. The diagnosis should only be made after careful analysis of all available data, including from a thorough history and clinical interview. A professional fluent in the primary language of the patient is strongly preferred. When such a provider is not available, services of a professional language interpreter must be provided. Frequency: When assessing for a pre -existing, unrelated mental health issue that has been made worse by, or is impeding the recovery from (or both) a work -related, medical injury or illness, then a one -time visit for initial psychiatric/psychological encou nter should be sufficient, as care would normally be continued by the prior treating provider. If psychometric testing is indicated by findings in the initial encounter, NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 13 time for such testing should not exceed an additional three hours of professional time . For conditions in which a mental health issue is a central part of the initial claim, or in which there is a mental health issue that is secondary or consequential to the work - related, medical injury or illness, that is part of the claim in question, the n more extensive diagnostic and therapeutic interventions may be clinically indicated, and are discussed in detail in the Medical Treatment Guidelines for such mental health conditions. A.17 Personality/Psychological/Psychosocial Intervention Following psychosocial evaluation, when intervention is recommended, such intervention should be implemented as soon as possible. This can be used alone or in conjunction with other treatment modalities. Fo r all psychological/psychiatric interventions, there must be an assessment and treatment plan with measurable behavioral goals, time frames and specific interventions planned . Time to produce effect: two to eight weeks. Optimum duration: six weeks to t hree months. Maximum duration: three to six months. Counseling is not intended to delay but rather to enhance functional recovery. For PTSD Psychological Intervention: Optimum duration three to six months. Maximum duration: nine to twelve months. For select patients, longer supervision and treatment may be required, and if further treatment is indicated, documentation of the nature of the psychological factors, as well as projecting a realistic functional prognosis, should be provided by the authoriz ed treating practitioner every four weeks during the first six months of treatment. For treatment expected to last six to twelve months, such documentation should be provided every four to eight weeks. For long -term treatment beyond twelve months, such documentation should be provided every eight to twelve weeks. All parties should strive for ongoing and continuous communications, in order to facilitate seamless, continuous and uninterrupted treatment. A.18 Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) Functional capacity evaluation is a comprehensive or more restricted evaluation of the various aspects of function as they relate to the patient's ability to return to work. Areas such as endurance, lifting (dy namic and static), postural tolerance, specific range -of- motion, coordination and strength, worker habits, employability, as well as psychosocial, cognitive, and sensory perceptual aspects of competitive employment may be evaluated. Components of this eval uation may include: (a) musculoskeletal job (f) voluntary effort; (g) pain assessment/psychological screening; (h) n on-material and material handling activities; (i) cognitive and behavioral; (j) visual; and (k) sensory perceptual factors. In most cases, the question of whether a patient can return to work can be answered without an FCE. NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 14 An FCE may be considered at time of MMI, following reasonable prior attempts to return to full duty throughout course of treatment, when the treating physician is unable to make a clear determination on work status on case closure. An FCE is not indicated early during a treatment regime for any reason including one to support a therapeutic plan. When an FCE is being used to determine return to a specific job site, the treating physician is responsible for understanding and considering the job duties. FCE s cannot be used in isolation to determine work restrictions. The authorized treating physician must interpret the FCE in light of the individual patient's presentation and medical and personal perceptions. FCEs should not be used as the sole criteria to d iagnose malingering. A.19 Return To Work For purposes of these guidelines, return to work is defined as any work or duty that the patient is able to perform safely. It may not be the patient's regular work. Ascertaining a return to work status is part of medical care , and should be included in the treatment and rehabilitation plan. It is normally addressed at every outpatient visit. A description of the patient's status and task limitations is part of any tre atment plan and should provide the basis for restriction of work activities when warranted. Early return to work should be a prime goal in treating occupational injuries. The emphasis within these guidelines is to move patients along a continuum of care a nd return to work, since the prognosis of returning an injured worker to work drops progressively the longer the worker has been out of work. A.20 Job Site Evaluation The treating physician may communicate with the employer or employer's designee, either in person, by video conference, or by telephone, to obtain information regarding the individual or specific demands of the patient's pre -injury job. This may include a description of the exertional demands of the job, the ne ed for repetitive activities, load lifting, static or awkward postures, environmental exposures, psychological stressors and other factors that would pose a barrier to re -entry, risk of re -injury or disrupt convalescence. When returning to work at the pati ent's previous job tasks or setting is not feasible, given the clinically determined restrictions on the patient's activities, inquiry should be made about modified duty work settings that align with, the patient's condition in view of proposed work activi ties/demands in modified duty jobs. It should be noted, that under certain circumstances, more than one job site evaluation may be indicated. Ideally, the physician would gain the most information from an on -site inspection of the job settings and activiti es; but it is recognized that this may not be feasible in most cases. If job videos/CDs/DVDs are available from the employer, these can contribute valuable information, as can video conferences, conducted from the worksite and ideally workstation or work a rea. Frequency: one or two c ontacts 1st contact : Patient is in a functional state where the patient can perform some work. 2nd contact : Patient has advanced to state where the patient is capable of enhanced functional demands in a work environment. NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 15 The physician shall document the conversation. Other A.21 Guideline Recommendations and Medical Evidence The Workers' Compensation Board and its Medical Advisory Committee have not independently evaluated or vetted the scientific medical literature used in support of the guidelines, but have relied on the methodology used by the developers of various guidelines utilized and referenced in these Guidelines. A.22 Experimental/Investigatio nal Treatment Medical treatment that is experimental/investigational and not approved for any purpose, application or indication by the FDA is not permitted under these Guidelines. A.23 Injured Workers As Patients In these Guidelines, injured workers are referred to as patients recognizing that in certain circumstances there is no doctor -patient relationship. A.24 Scope Of Practice These Guidelines do not address scope of practice or change the scope of practice. NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 16 Complex Regional Pain Syndrome Effective: 05/02/2022 B. Overview of Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a severely painful condition that is most often associated with recent trauma or injury. It has been variously defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain and the \"Budapest Criteria\" as generally including the presence of diffuse moderate to severe non -dermatomal pain, usually with allodynia . B.1 CRPS Diagnostic Criteria Most of the diagnostic criteria reported include common characteristics for the diagnosis of CRPS. However, there have been some differences in case definition criteria. The below has what may be the most used and supportable criteria. CRPS -I (a.k.a. \"Reflex Sympathetic Dysthrophy\" or \" RSD \") general definition: a painful condition that develops after an initiating noxious event, not limited to the distribution of a single peripheral nerve. The syndrome shows variable progression over time. In CRPS -II (a.k.a. \" Causalgia \"), a specific nerve is involved and pain is within the distribution of the damaged nerve. To make the clinical diagnosis, the following criteria must be met: 1. Continuing pain, which is disproportionate to any inciting event. 2. Must report at least one symptom in three of the fo ur following categories: a. Sensory: Reports of hyperesthesia and/or allodynia b. Vasomotor: Reports of temperature asymmetry and/or skin color changes and/or color asymmetry. c. Sudomotor/Edema: Reports of edema and/or sweating changes and/or sweating asymmetry . d. Motor/Trophic: Reports of decreased range of motion and/or motion dysfunction (weakness, tremor, dystonia) and/or trophic changes (hair, nail, skin). 3. Must display at lease one sign at time of evaluation in two or more of the following categories: a. Sensor y: Evidence of hyperalgesia and/or allodynia. b. Vasomotor: Evidence of temperature asymmetry (>1 degree centigrade) and/or skin color changes and/or asymmetry. c. Sudomotor/Edema: Evidence of edema and/or sweating changes and/or sweating asymmetry. d. Motor/Tro phic: Evidence of decreased range of motion and/or motor dysfunction (weakness, tremor, dystonia) and/or trophic changes (hair, nail, skin). 4. There is no other diagnosis that better explains the signs and symptoms. NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 17 These criteria are recommended for diag nosing CRPS, but may be challenging, as objective measurements and equipment such as infrared temperature probes, volumetry, goniometers and pain scales are required . For patients not meeting the diagnostic criteria, or if CRPS either continues or progresses, the diagnosis of CRPS should be confirmed by an appropriately trained Physic ian (MD or DO), typically trained in such specialties including, but not necessarily limited to: Pain Medicine; Neurology; Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation; or Occupational Medicine. Such a referral examination should particularly focus on the exclusi on of another explanatory diagnosis, the presence of a temporal inciting event, the historical information particularly from a credible patient, objective evidence (e.g., bone scan), presence of a known nerve injury (CRPS II), and application and comparis ons with the diagnostic criteria . In those cases where electrodiagnostic studies are indicated, they should be conducted in accordance with the practice parameters of the American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM). It is recommended and preferred that electrodiagnostic studies in the out - patient setting be performed and interpreted by physicians board -certified in Neurology or Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. The threshold for concomitant psychological consultation and psychometric testing in such circumstances should be quite low. [Please also see Medical Treatment Guidelines for Non -Acute Pain, Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders, and PTSD ]. Recommendations on assessing and treating adults with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) are presented herein. [For diagnosis and treatment of non -acute pain not due to CRPS, please see the Medical Treatment Guideline for Nan -Acute Pain.] Topics inclu de the initial assessment and diagnosis of patients with CRPS , identification of red flags that may suggest the presence of a serious underlying medical condition, initial clinical evaluation, management, diagnostic considerations, and special studies to i dentify clinical pathology, work -relatedness, modified duty and activity, rehabilitative strategies, return to work, psychological evaluation, behavioral treatments, and further management considerations including delayed recovery. C. Risk and Causatio n CRPS is reported most frequently after a traumatic insult , central nervous system insults including strokes , myocardial infarction, or other major system insult. CRPS Type II involves an overt nerve lesion. There are relatively infrequent occasions where the cause is unknown (approximately 5 to 15%). CRPS has a reported prevalence of 20.6 to 113.5 per 100,000 adults . It has sometimes been categorized into subtypes, including warm and cold . Females are diagnosed with CRPS 3.4 times more frequently than males, and in cidence is highest among the 50 - to 70 -year age range. Upper -extremity injuries are more commonly associated with CRPS as compared to lower extremities, and a fracture is the most common injury type associated with CRPS. The risk of CRPS has been estimat ed at 1% among patients with distal radius fractures. D. Initial Assessment The initial assessment requires a thorough history and physical examination with somewhat different emphases compared with most chronic pain patient evaluations. This includes a NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 18 history of symptoms, trauma, purported cause of the symptoms, treatments atte mpted, and exercises performed. The history and physical examination require particular attention to differences in use of the limb, strength, color, and temperature. Selective testing may be needed to confirm the clinical impression. The most important emphasis is to exclude other potential explanatory conditions. The clinician performing an initial evaluation of a patient with chronic pain has the particularly difficult task of ascertaining whether there is (are) other treatable, explanatory condition (s) present. Yet it is also critical to avoid over -testing which may result in increased morbidity (e.g. iatrogenic impairment) through either direct adverse effects of the tests themselves, or more likely through creating and contributing to a mind frame of endless searching for a potential lesion to be \"cured.\" Findings of the medical history and physical examination may alert the clinician to other pathology that can present with pain or some of the other constitutional symptoms with which the patient with chronic pain may present. Certain findings, referred to as red flags, raise suspicion of serious underlying medical conditions (see Table 1). Potentially serious disorders include infections, tumors, and systemic rheumatologi cal disorders. A careful, thorough history is required. The approach generally needs to be comprehensive, exploring all aspects of the physical complaints. A relevant review of symptoms is necessary. It is critical to evaluate psychological and social fac tors. Equally important is the evaluation of occupational and environmental functions, with particular emphases on psychological, physical and social barriers that may be addressed to limit the impacts of the condition Absent red flags, most patients with common forms of chronic non -malignant pain may be described as having one or more of the following conditions: Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS): Type I or Type II; Neuropathic pain: central, peripheral, or radicular; Trigger points/myofascial pain ; Tender points/fibromyalgia; Degenerative joint disease, including osteoarthros is or osteoarthritis ; Chronic spine pai n; Chronic pain syndrome; Chronic lower abdominal/pelvic pain; Chronic non -specific pain syndrome; and/or Psychological disorders (most common are the affective disorders, anxiety, depression ). Please also see Medical Treatment Guidelines for Non -Acute Pain, if applicable. It should be noted that patients with chronic pain syndromes may have one or more of several psychological disor ders. Depressive disorders are particularly prominent factors . Please also see Medical Treatent Gudeline for Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders. D.1 Red Flags NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 19 Physical evidence of an underlying medical or psychological problem that correlates with the medical history and test results may suggest a need for immediate consultation. A history of malignancy, infection, endocrinological or systemic disorder may suggest the possibility of an underlying serious condition. A medical history that suggests pathology originating in a location other than that originally injured may require investigations that would not appear to be related to the work injury but would nonetheless need to be performed (e.g., shoulder pain from gall bladder or cerv ical spine; joint complaints from rheumatological disorders). Psychosocial red flags include dangerousness to self or others, acute intoxication, psychosis, and homelessness. Evidence of risk factors for delayed recovery may also be of concern, and may be considered \"yellow\" flags. Table 1 focuses primarily on systemic conditions that may have been missed in a patient with complaints of chronic pain. However, if the person has no past history, then the professional should still evaluate, assess and query a bout current psychological issues due to the high co -morbidity rate with chronic pain.

In the absence of red flags, the evaluation of the patient with chronic pain may progress as noted below. The evaluation is recommended to be centered on function, while not ignoring pain. D.2 Symptoms and Signs May Include Constant severe burning or throbbing pain typically isolated to one limb Trauma often precedes symptoms, and symptoms are disproportionate to the trauma Non-radiating pain Significantly worsening pain with activity Sensitivity to touch, unusual sensitivity and pain to minor pressure or palpation Sensitivity to cold Skin coloration changes, including blanching and mottling Swelling of the affected limb Skin texture changes Changes in hair and nails Muscle spasms Hyperesthesia and/or allodynia Temperature asymmetry and/or skin color changes and/or color asymmetry NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 21 Edema and/or sweating changes and/or s weating asymmetry Decreased range of motion and/or motion dysfunction (weakness, tremor, dystonia) trophic changes (hair, nail, skin). D.3 History Because CRPS most commonly starts with an injury or event, the medical history naturally starts with the details of that event. Characteristics of pain are then elicited that are unusual and disproportionate compared with the degree of the injury. Excess ive sensitivity to normally nonpainful stimuli, such as pressure on the skin develops. Unusual and asymmetric temperature differences between the limbs occur frequently. Cold intolerance is common. Edema occurs. Later changes include skin texture, nail s and hair. Disuse and weakness of the limb becomes nearly universal, especially if the condition is not recognized early and strengthening and conditioning exercises not prescribed. A focus on the potential for a treatable condition is mandatory for an initial evaluation of a patient with CRPS or chronic pain. Nevertheless, it is recommended that the initial evaluation of patients with CRPS or chronic pain also start with a focus on function, both at work and home. This sets the focus on function that is essential for the vast majority of CRPS , while maintaining a focus on confirmation that prior examiners did not miss a treatable disorder. Collecting information about occupational history and patterns of daily living and interests assists in understandi ng patient priorities and targeted outcomes. Responses frequently also provide powerful clues to activities the patient is interested in resuming that may ultimately provide the motivational tools to facilitate the patient's functional restoration. The pro vider should ask typical questions focused on pain symptoms. Current pain treatments, whether medical or non -medical, should be recorded. Past pain treatments should be reviewed with a careful discernment and documentation of meaningful, lasting functional improvements. After the function -based and pain histories are obtained, the history should next include a thorough medical history, past medical history, medication history, surgical history, accident history, current psychological history, and past psychological histor y. Approach pain complaints as an integral element of each history and physical examination. However, the primary focus should be on function, rather than pain to avoid an undue focus on pain and pain ratings. This includes assessing pain complaints rel ative to casual patient observations, the physical examination and observation of the patient's functions both while actively examined and ideally outside of the context of the performance of a physical examination. Obtaining a history of functional activi ties from family members or friends may sometimes be useful. D.4 Physical Examination NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 22 The physical examination of a patient with well -established signs of CRPS is almost always straight -forward particularly for the examiner familiar with CRPS. However, early findings are often clinically subtle and the diagnosis may be more tentative. Still the primary intervention is the same: education and directed specialized physical/occupational therapy with primary emphasis on strengthening, functional active use, and aerobic components to prevent dysfunction. Early psychological interventions may benefit selected individuals as well, particularly if there is concomitant post -traumatic stress disorder , other psychological/behavioral disorders, and/or poor coping. Of ten the patient will be observed limiting use of the extremity, including protecting and avoiding use of the limb. This can include not shaking hands or weight bearing on the affected limb. A key feature of this condition is that objective findings in the affected extremity contrast significantly with those of the unaffected extremity. The skin temperature may differ, usually being cooler in the affected extremity, although it can be warmer. If advanced, the skin may have a smooth, thinned, atrophic appear ance . Skin temperature should be measured with infrared equipment and should be at least 1\u00b0C different for CRPS. Skin coloration changes are also generally present, including mottling. Livido reticularis (a mottled purplish discoloration of the skin) may be present. The extremity may become edematous. With passage of time, the nails may also become atrophic. A distinguishing characteristic is allodynia, or the experience of pain with something that normal individuals would not consider painful. Examples include pain with light touch, shaking hands, or even the weight of the clothing on the extremity. Circumferences of the affected extremity may differ. They may be increased in edema tous states (generally earlier), and reduced if there is disuse dystrophy in chronic states. Water displacement volumes may be measured to attempt to ascertain degrees of swelling, although the baseline measures will not be comparable with the pre-morbid s tate, which is unknown. Additional findings reported include misperceiving the correct finger that is being touched, inability to identify an object solely with tactile input (astereognosis), and hand laterality identification with motor imagery. While occasional measurements may be acceptable, there is a tendency towards preoccupation with those measures by some, which has the potential to draw attention away from active therapy, towards symptoms and signs, and may inadvertently promote delayed recovery . A well -performed physical examination is indicated for the evaluation of a patient with CRPS . Components of the physical examination should follow those of the relevant body part involved and will not be detailed in this section ( see other Medical Treatment Guidelines ). The examination of individuals with somatoform disorders or other behavioral/psychological disorders is often indistinguishable from that of psychologically no rmal individuals. The threshold for psychological referral, including psychometric testing should be quite low. Observation of the patient is believed to be the most important aspect of the physical examination. It should begin at the start of the visit - or better still, through a report from the medical assistant who put the patient in an examining room. It should include an evaluation of the patient's ability to arise from a seated position (and other positional changes), gait in the hallway (e.g ., for all lower extremity complaints ), utilization of limbs for tasks, and facial expressions in the course of performing those functions. Synergistic and dys -synergistic history and physical examination findings should be recorded. NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 23 Particularly in the setting of CRPS , signs that are inconsistent with symptoms should be sought. It should be noted that positive results with these maneuvers are sometimes erroneously taken to be definitive of factitious illness and/or malingering. That may or may not be t rue. More commonly, it is believed that these may be positive when patients in pain subconsciously exhibit a need for further attention to the painful disorder or sometimes may represent psychological dysfunction. In the context of CRPS, they may simply be part of the clinical presentation. Nevertheless, t heir presence may indicate the need for psychosocial evaluation or consultation with other specialists , particularly when multiple signs are present in the context of significant delayed recovery. Makin g an accurate diagnosis in the context of possible CRPS can be very difficult, because there are many diagnoses that can present similar to CRPS , and the subjectively reported symptoms in CRPS very often are not consistent with either the presenting histor y, or initial objective findings. The differential diagnosis of CRPS may include but not necessarily be limited to: , disuse , repetitive strain injury , fibromyalgia psychiatric psychosocial problems (somatoform pain Munchhausen syndrome thyroid disorders; diabetes mellitus; or alcoholic polyneuropathy. This list is not intended t o be exhaustive but merely intended to illikstrate the complexity of the differential diagnosis. Moreover, inclusion of such diagnoses as compensation neurosis, malingering or factitious disorder should not be misconstrued as undermining the legitimacy of the pain complaints of patients who actually have CRPS. In the CRPS setting, it is frequently helpful to obtain measurements of the patient's capabilities in the clinic to then follow in subsequent clinic visits while the patient is undergoing rehabilit ation services. These may include the following: Walking distance (observe in the hallway or outdoors and subsequently simultaneously interview the patient about their progress if a longer walking ability is demonstrated) Ability to climb stairs (walking t o the nearest stairwell with the patient and observing capabilities) Dynamometer grip strength measurements Pinch strength Repeated toe raises (number able to perform) Distance of heel walking Squats (number) Sensory examination findings (e.g., monofilamen ts) Movement inconsistent with pain/injury problem while in exam room This allows more informed decision making exercise and other physical activity benchmarks , and is believed to be quite helpful to facilitate the patient's recovery . The use of validated functional assessment tools to follow patient progress is another recommended approach. NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 24 E. Biopsychosocial Approach to CRPS The \"biopsychosocial model\" which emphasizes the need to account for the unique interactions between biological, psychological, and social factors in order to better understand health and illness, is now commonly utilized to explain and manage CRPS and other chronic pain, since the traditional medical model of acute injury resulting in pain and tissue damage does not explain chronic pain syndromes . Central nervous system (CNS) factors may explain the experience of pain in the absence of tissue damage or after healing has taken place . Genetic factors may also play roles in the perception and responses to pain . Psychological and social factors are also involved in the perception and interpretation of pain symptoms and their effects on home and work life . Psycho logical factors may be prominent in the management of patients with CRPS , and may profoundly influence the individual's ability to modulate pain and distress, and are better managed after earlier identification. In settings of acute pain (e.g., trauma), b rief inactivity may reduce pain. However, in subacute to chronic problems, inactivity either results in no improvement or more pain, delays recovery, and is accompanied by deconditioning. Thus, increased activity is indicated for essentially every chronic condition associated with persistent pain. For select, acute pain conditions, reduced activity limitations to facilitate recovery may be appropriate. Yet, in the chronic context, recovery is usually dependent on performing those specific activities that m ay elicit the pain on a gradually increased basis in order to return to as near normal function as possible . There is increasing consensus to implement increased activity levels earlier and earlier in the acute and subacute phases to prevent delayed reco very. E.1 Palliate or Rehabilitate A related untoward outcome from the failure of successful restoration of normal function during the initial phases of treatment is the decision to make palliation the main focus of subsequent interventions. To palliate rather than rehabilitate is a profound clinical, ethical, and medico -economic decision that should not be taken lightly . While a patient's complaints of pain should be acknowledged, both patient and provider should remain focuse d on the ultimate goal of rehabilitation leading to optimal functional recovery . This guideline focuses primarily on chronic pain due to CRPS, and its evaluation and treatment. Complete pain relief is clearly a highly desirable endpoint, especially in acute pain states, yet it is usually unattainable in patients with chronic pain due to CRPS . Pain treatment should emphasize functional restoration and pain relief. Emphasizing only pain relief may reinforce negative psychological, environmental, and depen dent psychosocial factors that predispose progression to chronic pain states and addiction(s). In chronic pain states, emphasis on functional restoration should focus on improving function while reducing pain or limiting flare -ups to manageable levels. Patient education is also an important component to achieve the goals, as without the patient joining the treatment team, progress is typically very slow and the goals may not be achieved. Pain that cannot be adequately explained by specific physical findin gs raises many questions: When does acute pain become chronic? Is the diagnosis correct? Is there a second diagnosis? Are changes in the patient's central nervous system creating pain hypersensitivity? What else is going on in the patient's life, either at home or at work, NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 25 which may be aggravating his or her pain or reinforcing pain or illness behavior? Does the current treatment improve function? What role should patients play in promoting optimal function in everyday living and enabling meaningful family , workplace, and social relationships? What is the patient's emotional response to pain? The following discussion sheds light on these questions and suggests an interdisciplinary model to address the multiple components of the patient's CRPS. E.2 Psycho logical Issues Please also see Medical Treatment Guidelines for Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders, and PTSD. Pain-related fear is believed to contribute to pain and disability in several ways. While pain avoidance is natural, persons who exhibit greater pain -related fear tend to avoid more situations than would be normal due to their belief that they may cause p ain, leading to greater activity avoidance. Thus, pain-related fear and associated avoidance of activity may contribute to disability independently of the pain itself. This may lead to greater physical deconditioning, but may also lead to musculoskeletal abnormalities such as muscle guarding while bending, which in turn may directly contribute to pain behavior . Pain-related fear is significantly related to greater perceived disability . Gradually exposing patients to fearful activities as a pathway to reduce or extinguish pain -related fear can be a powerful intervention for chronic pain due to CRPS . A decline in pain - related fear may reduce pain hypervigilance, resulting in a decline in r eported pain intensity. Reductions in pain -related fear may be partially responsible for improvement seen in functional restoration programs . The Biopsychosocial Model The biopsychosocial model (BPS) views health as including optimism, social support, good coping, positive mood, moti vation, and work ethic. The model views disorders such as chronic pain due to CRPS as the result of a dynamic interaction among physiologic, psychological, and social factors which perpetuate and may worsen the clinical presentation. Thus, the model explai ns some patients with severe injuries who have profound perseverance, motivation and superior recovery. The BPS model recognizes that each individual experiences pain uniquely, with a range of psychological and socioeconomic factors interacting with physi cal pathology to modulate a patient's report of symptoms and subsequent disability. These in turn are hypothesized to lead to neurochemical changes at the central level, with the central nervous system altered by chronic pain to increase sensitivity to incoming impulses that amplify pain . Activation is believed to lead to further physiological changes, the extent of which are hypothesized to depend on intrinsic (genetic and physiological) and extrinsic factors, which exacerbate and perpetuate a syndrome in which the experience of pain increases despite a lack of objective reasons for this to occur. NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 26 In the BPS Mode l, pain is defined as a noxious sensory AND emotional experience. Pain is known to have components designated as nociception, pain, suffering, emotional and pain behavior. The perception of pain may occur in the absence of nociception (or neuropathy) and v ice versa. In clinical contexts, pain behavior may be defined as \"any response or set of responses which communicates the concept of pain to another person.\" The concept may be broadened to the notion of illness behavior, which involves other health rel ated complaints and responses. Pain behaviors may be considered symptoms in acute pain presentations , however over time they may come under control of various psychosocial or learning influences . There is a common misconception that such behaviors may represent consciously \"exaggerated\" or \"magnified\" symptoms. This is not possible to assess direc tly, and such conceptions are often pejorative. Pain or illness behaviors may evolve in persons with chronic pain due to CRPS that are secondary to a wide range of psychosocial antecedents and learning or conditioning influences. Because there is no kn own relationship between nociception, pain, and pain behavior when a condition becomes such as with CRPS , such behavior should be conceptualized as a clinical finding . Pain behavior is also not equivalent to \"secondary gain\". While the latter is generally based on presumptively seeking reward or other desirable consequences of an injury, pain behavior may be learned or conditioned, shaped, and maintained by subtle reinforcement in persons about whom such psychological inferences may be inappropriate . There is evidence that perso ns with non-acute pain abd CRPS may be uniquely sensitive to operant and classical conditioning in the learning of pain responses . Chronic non -malignant pain may foster psychosocial and behavioral dysfunction, as well as magnify pain. The distinctions between these situations become important in the development of interventions to address them. In persons with non-acute pain due to C RPS, many permutations of these concepts are possible. For example, significant and disabling pain and illness behavior may evolve and become a clinical problem, even in the absence of clinically meaningful nocicep tion or pain. Pain behavior may be noted in the presence of nociception or neuropathy, but the patient may not be suffering in clinically meaningful ways and may not be disabled. It is important to view the patient in this context and evaluate and treat these components appropriately, which requires a more complex evaluation and treatment plan than required for the patient with uncomplicated acute pain. F. Diagnostic Testing Diagnostic testing considerations are defined by the clinical entity and body part being investigated. Testing commonly used for the identification of other disorders is often required to assure that other diagnoses are not present. This should not be cons idered as justification for ordering tests indiscriminately. Tests should instead, be ordered if there is a reasonable probability that the diagnosis is present. Sometimes, the threshold for ordering a test is lower if the adverse effects from missing the diagnosis are considerable. Imaging studies can identify abnormalities such as edema, demineralization, or osteoporosis that are consistent with one of the diagnoses associated with chronic pain, but mostly these are non -specific findings. There are differ ent lines of clinical investigation of potentially useful technologies that purportedly assist in objectively diagnosing underlying pathology. NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 27 F.1 Psychological Evaluation for CRPS Patients Recommended - as part of the evaluation and management of pati ents with chronic pain in order to identify psychosocial barriers that are contributing to disability and inhibiting function and to assess whether psychological factors will need to be considered and treated as part of the overall treatment plan. Indications: Moderate to severe CRPS in certain clinical circumstances. (Please see Behavioral Interventions section below for a more detailed discussion). F.2 Laboratory Tests for Peripheral Neuropathic Pain Recommended - as a screen to evaluate specif ic disorders (e.g., diabetes mellitus, alcohol) that may cause or contribute to peripheral neuropathic pain. Indications : Patients with peripheral neuropathies without prior diagnostic evaluations. Diagnostic testing should generally include fasting gl ucose and either hemoglobin A1c and/or 2 -hour glucose tolerance testing. The threshold for testing for signs of alcohol should also be quite low (i.e., CBC with Mean Cell Volume, GGTP, AST and ALT). Testing is advisable even if other diagnostic testing f inds another disorder (e.g., occupational neurotoxin) to assure there is not another, treatable, contributing factor. Frequency/Dose/Duration : One evaluation. A second evaluation may be indicated when either there is a significant change in exposure (e.g., substantial weight gain) or symptoms change. F.3 Antibodies for Diagnosing Chronic Pain with Suspicion of Rheumatological Disorder Recommended - as a screen to confirm specific disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus) and for assessing patients with suspicion for rheumatological disorder. Indications: Undiagnosed patients with either systemic arthropathies and/or peripheral neuropathies, or patients have had incomplete evaluations. Diagnostic testing should generally include sedimentation rate. Other tests may include rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody level, and others. Testing is advisable even if other diagnostic testing finds another disorder (e.g., occupational neurotoxin in presence of peripheral neuropathy) to as sure there is not another, treatable, contributing factor, especially if explanation of the symptoms is incomplete. Frequency/Dose/Duration: One evaluation. A second evaluation may be indicated with a significant change in symptoms. It is also reasonable to repeat testing after a period of a year or two as initial testing is known to occasionally become positive with the passage of time. They are recommended for focused testing of a few diagnostic considerations. However, ordering of a large, d iverse array of antibody levels without diagnostically targeting a few specific disorders is not recommended. NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 28 F.4 Antibodies to Confirm Specific Rheumatological Disorders Recommended - as a screen to confirm specific rheumatological disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) and for assessing patients with possible myofascial pain syndrome, especially with other symptoms. They are recommended for focused testing of a few diagnostic considerations. However, ordering of a large, diverse array of antibody level s without diagnostically targeting a few specific disorders is not recommended. F.4.a Diverse Array of Antibody Level Not Recommended - without targeting a few specific disorders diagnosticall y. F.5 Electrodiagnostic Studies (\"EDS\", e.g. Nerve Condiction Velocities and Needle Recommended - in select patients with CRPS -II. Indications: In select patients for whom making a diagnoss is difficult, in order to diagnose CRPS -II (as differientiated from CRPS -I, in which EDS are typically normal). These are typically p atients for whom laborory testing to detect peripheral neuropathies (as discussed above) wil be normal. Frequency/Dose/Duration : One evaluation. A second evaluation may be indicated when either there is a significant change in symptoms or function. Note: In those cases where electrodiagnostic studies are indicated, they should be conducted in accordance with the practice parameters of the American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM). It is recommended and preferred that electrodiagnostic studies in the out -patient setting be performed and interpreted by physicians board -certified in Neurology or Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. F.6 Autonomic Nervous System and Respiration (ANSAR) Testing for Diagnosing CRPS Not Recommended - to assist in diagnosing CRPS. ANSAR has not been shown to alter the clinical management of patients with CRPS. F.7 Bone Scanning for Diagnosing CRPS (Triple -Phase) Recommended - in select patients to confirm the diagnosis of CRPS of over six months duration. Indications : Symptoms of possible CRPS generally for at least three to six months, with an uncertain diagnosis. NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 29 Frequency/Dose/Duration : One evaluation. A second would be rarely indicated, e.g., concerns about occult fracture. Evidence for Bone Scanning F.8 X-rays for Diagnosing CRPS Recommended - to assist in the diagnosis of CRPS of over six months duration, although they are primarily used to rule -out other disorders. Indications: Symptoms of possible CRPS generally for at least three to six months, with an uncertain diagnosis. May be obtained early than three months for diagnosing other conditions. Frequency/Dose/Duration: One evaluation. A second would be rarely indicated, e. g., concerns about occult fracture. F.9 Non-specific Inflammatory Markers for Screening for Inflammatory Disorders Recommended - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and other inflammatory markers for screening for signs of systemic inflammation, particularly in assessing patients with ill - defined pain conditions. Indications : Undiagnosed patients with symptoms consistent with either systemic rheumatological diseases and/or patients have had incomplete evaluations. Subsequent, additional tests m ay be needed, including rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody level, and others. Testing is advisable even if other diagnostic testing finds another disorder (e.g., occupational neurotoxin) to assure there is not another, treatable, contributing factor, especially if explanation of the symptoms is incomplete. Frequency/Dose/Duration: One evaluation. A second evaluation may be indicated with a significant change in symptoms. It is also reasonable to repeat testing after a period of a year or two as initial testing is known to occasionally become positive with the passage of time. F.10 Cytokine Tests for Diagnosing CRPS Not Recommended - to diagnose CRPS and chronic pain. F.11 Surface EMG for Diagnosing CRPS Not Recommended - for the differential diagnosis of CRPS and chronic pain . Evidence for Surface EMG F.12 Functional MRIs for Diagnosing CRPS Not Recommended - for diagnosing CRPS. NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 30 F.13 Local Anesthetic Injections for Diagnosing CRPS Recommended - selectively recommended for evaluations in CRPS patients. Indications : Chronic persistent pain in a specific nerve distribution (e.g., ilioinguinal, genitofemoral) that is otherwise unexplained by other investigation, including imaging, EMG/NCS . Frequency/Dose/Duration : Once . Table 2. Benefits and Adverse Effects of Injections Benefits Identify treatable lesion. (e.g., nerve that is successfully blocked and results in identifying a treatable compression of that nerve. General complications of neuraxial injections, and of injections near the paravertebral muscles Infection at site and remote (meningitis found in one German study following trigger point, facet, and epidural injections). Bleeding, including hematoma causing nerve compromise. Direct trauma to nerve, causing permanent damage or increased pain. Injection into the wrong space (artery, vein, inadvertent intrathecal, or thoracic cavity). This can lead to respiratory compromise, cardiac arrest, or pneumothorax. Complications specifically related to the substance and amount injected (in addition to possible anaphylaxis) Local anesthetics - seizures, cardiac collapse. Sympatholytics - hypotension, tachycardia, cardiac dysrhythmias. Corticosteroids* - endocrine dysfunction, diabetes, hypertension, dysphoria, immune compromise, phlebitis, muscle pain, osteoporosis, dependency, rarely nerve damage, etc. Baclofen* - anxiety, blurred visi on, ataxia, coma, depression, dizziness, dysarthria, dystonic reaction, hallucinations, headache, respiratory depression, seizures, stroke, etc. Botulinum toxins - weakness, paralysis, respiratory compromise, diplopia, dizziness, injection site reaction. *These adverse effects are mostly temporary aggravations and dependent on dose and frequency. F.14 QSART for Diagnosing CRPS Not Recommended - to assist in the diagnostic confirmation of CRPS. F.15 SPECT/PET for Diagnosing CRPS Not Recommended - to evaluate patients with CRPS (aside from use in cases of suspected inflammatory arthropathies not diagnosed by more common tests). The use of PET scanning is also not recommended to evaluate patients with CRPS. F.16 Thermography for Diagno sing CRPS NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 31 Not Recommended - for diagnosing CRPS. Evidence for the Use of Thermography G. Management of CRPS G.1 Initial Care In general, interventions for treating pain should be time -limited and functional goal - oriented. Persons returning to work and life functions sooner after injury tend to have the best outcomes. Persons with equivalent diagnoses who are out of work for three months have worse return -to-work outcomes than those out one month, while those away for one year do worse than those out six months. Thus, there is a strong basis to return to a functional status sooner rather than later, including to work. As noted pr eviously (see Medical History), identification of psychosocial issues should be part of the initial evaluation or consultation for a new patient with CRPS . A few of these issues include current or past mental health issues, family, friends, co -workers, supervisor relationships and support, and drug -related issues. A comprehensive history and physical will generally identify at -risk individuals, after which referral to a psychologist or pain specialist can be considered . Referral to a psychologist or psyc hiatrist experienced in pain evaluation is often appropriate, especially when the pain is ill -defined, not well explained by anatomic or physiological abnormalities, associated with disability in excess of what would be expected based upon objective findin gs, or depression or anxiety are present. An additional consideration in the initial care of the patient with CRPS is whether a multidisciplinary approach should be instituted to minimize disability and maximize function. This is described later in this do cument. The following is a short outline or overview of the therapeutic approach . Identify remediable generators of nociception or neuropathy (e.g., aggressive treatment of diabetes for diabetic neuropathy; aggressive rehabilitation exercises for CRPS). When there is no readily resolvable pain generator, the focus should be on functional restoration. Treatments should be individualized, taking into account co - morbidities and preferences. Address co -morbid mental health conditions with appropriate behavioral modification or medications. Medications or other treatments that have not been of clear benefit with an adequate trial should be discontinued prior to institution of alternative options. Treatments that are of some benefit should be continued wh ile alternatives are weighed and checked to attain a reasonable chronic pain modulation (as a partial control is better than none in this population) to prevent them from seeking potentially detrimental treatment schemes. Medication effectiveness and adver se effects should be reviewed regularly with the patient and well documented in the medical record. Providers should periodically assess the appropriateness of dose reductions, tapering and NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 32 deprescribing where appropropriate ( NonAcute Pain Medic al Treatment Guideline ). Interventions with the potential for serious adverse effects should be employed only if pain reduction and functional improvement will reasonably outweigh potential harms to the patient , and only continued if this is demonstrated t o be the case . Such interventions should be preceded by an adequate trial of conservative care. However, there are times when judicious interventional or medication therapy may be more appropriate than other strategies with potential to reduce pain and ove rall costs. Treatment of CRPS consists of a combination of therapies and interventions. Physical and psychosocial aspects should be considered when developing a treatment plan to suit the patient's needs, reduce their pain, and improve their function. Mos t importantly, the patient must actively participate in the treatment plan. This often requires substantial and continued patient educational efforts. G.2 Activities and Activity Alteration The overwhelming theme in the management of most patients with CRPS is to keep them as physically active as possible . There is no reason to avoid using the affected body part even in severe cases. All patients require advancement of activity levels and education because inactivity is detrimental despite the temporary relief of symptoms that often accompanies it. While acute pain from an acute injury (not an acute manifestation of disease) may at times be successfully treated through a reduction in activity (e.g., casting a fractured extremity), subacute and chronic pain are best treated in exactly the opposite manner. In the late acute phase of subacute and chronic pain, the patient is generally best treated by performing gradually increased or graded activities to incrementally regain a fully functional status (i.e., usually requiring tolerating pain with each graded increase in occupational and non -occupational activity) or as full a functional status as possible . In general, patients with mild symptoms should be encouraged to perform all activities as normally as possible. They likely w ill require education and exercises. Those with moderate symptoms may or may not be able to work. If not, they should be in a therapy program, including daily home exercises, and gradually advancing activity levels outside of work within a program that tar gets return to work and meaningful productivity as a main treatment goal. Transition into the workplace is often useful for patients with CRPS who are not working, particularly those with severe problems. Such transitioning usually requires careful coordin ation between the patient, treatment team, supervisor and co -workers. It may involve beginning on a modified duty job for 2 hours a day, then gradually advancing job physical requirements and/or length of time on the job until the individual is back to wor k full time. This process may take many weeks for those more severely affected, but is usually a highly effective method to both provide treatment and actively rehabilitate the patient with CRPS . Precise numbers of physical and occupational therapy appoin tments are difficult to predict, due to the complexities of diagnosis, severity of the condition, degree of impairment and individual factors involving ability to tolerate and exercise through pain. The key questions involve the documentation of ongoing, progressive, objective NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 33 functional gains (e.g., return to work status, reducing work limitations, more repetitions of a rehabilitative exercise, walking further, etc.). As long as there is meaningful functional progress, additional therapy appointments may be warranted until a plateau in function is reached , at which time a transition to a long -term home exercise program is indicated . In general, prescribing therapy appointments for CRPS patients in increments of 10-12 appointments and then reassessing for functional gain prior to further prescriptions of additional appointments is recommended. A common approach is to gradually length en time between visits. These approaches also allow for the development and implementat ion of a home exercise program. A similar process for other appointments is also recommended regarding documentation of functional gain. In general, activities causing a significant increase in symptoms should be reviewed with the patient and modificati ons advised when appropriate. Home and work activities may require at least temporary modification. An increase in pain does not represent or document damage. Instead, an increase in short -term pain as a result of increased activity levels in patients with CRPS is actually believed to be normal and not detrimental to recovery. While the patient is being treated for CRPS , activities that do not aggravate symptoms should nearly always be maintained, and exercises to prevent debilitation due to inactivity shou ld be advised. Aerobic exercise may be beneficial as a part of a therapeutic management technique that includes strengthening exercises as the cornerstone for management of patients with CRPS (see Exercise). Stretching and flexibility exercises are particu larly required where there is a significant limitation in range of motion and sometimes must precede strengthening exercises depending on the severity of the deficits. The patient should be informed that activities might temporarily increase symptoms but that such exacerbations are normal. G.3 Work Activities Work activity modification is an important part of many treatment regimens. Advice on how to avoid substantially aggravating activities that at least temporarily increase pain includes a review of work duties to decide whether or not modifications can be accomplished without employer notification and to determine whether modified duty is appropriate and available. Making every attempt to maintain patients at the maximal levels of activity, including work activities, is strongly recommended as it is in their best clinical and functional interest . The analysis of work ability requires an assessment of \"risk,\" \"capacity,\" and \"tolerance.\" Risk refers to what a patient can do, but should not do, due to the substantial risk of significant harm, considering proba bility and severity of potential adverse events. Providers impose work restrictions based on estimates of risk. Capacity refers to what a patient is physically capable of doing, as measured by concepts such as range of motion, exercise ability in metabolic equivalents (METs), etc. Tolerance for chronic symptoms is the basis for a patient (not a provider) to decide whether the rewards of work are worth the cost of the symptoms. The first step in determining whether work activity modifications are required usually involves a discussion with the patient regarding whether he/she has control over the job tasks. In such cases where the worker can, for example, get assistance from someone else, there may be no requirement to write any restrictions even if the pai n is limiting. Assessment of work activities and potential for modifications may also be NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 34 facilitated by a worksite visit and analysis by a health care provider with appropriate training. Work modifications should be tailored taking into account two main fa ctors: 1) the job physical requirements; and 2) the safety of the tasks, in the context of case -specific factors. Sometimes it is necessary to write limitations or prescribe activity levels that are above what the patient feels he/she can do, particularl y when the patient feels that complete rest or similar non -activity is advisable. In such cases, education about CRPS and the need to remain active should be provided. Common limitations involve modifying the weight of objects lifted, degree of stereotypi cal activity allowed (low, medium, high), frequency of lifts, and posture, all while taking into account the patient's capabilities. As noted above, there are many variables that must be incorporated into prescriptions of physical activities, thus they require individualization. These are clinical judgments. For severe cases of CRPS involving an upper extremity, frequent initial limitations for occupational and non - occupational activities might potentially include: Working two hours a day; No lifting over five pounds; and No highly repetitive or high force activities (e.g., push/pull ) involving the affected hand. For severe CRPS involving a lower extremity or the spine, frequent initial limitations for occupational and non -occupational activities might potentially include: Working two hours a day; No lifting over ten pounds; and Alternate sitting and standing as needed. These work and home activity guidelines are generally reassessed every week in the early rehabilitation process with graded increases in activity recommended so that patients with CRPS may maintain or regain their hig hest level of function. It is best to communicate early in the treatment that limitations will be progressively reduced as the patient progresses. Experienced providers communicate the intended changes in restrictions for the coming week (similar to forec asting increases in exercise program components) at the current visit to reduce the element of surprise and help actively facilitate the patient's most important elements of an active, functional restoration program. Tailoring of restrictions is required i n nearly all patients with CRPS as there is great variability in symptoms and dysfunction. The employer should also be consulted while developing strategies to expedite and support integration of the patient into the workplace. The provider can assist pat ients and employers in explaining that: The patients usually have increased pain performing almost any function in the early rehabilitation timeframe, even if \"light\" duty; Increases in pain do not equate to injury for patients with CRPS ; Increases in symptoms should be heard with a sympathetic ear and the factors which are associated with significant increases in pain should be addressed; Any restrictions are intended to allow for time to build activity tolerance through exercise; and NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 35 Where appropriate, it may be helpful to mention to the patien t that this rehabilitative plan will also help him/her to regain normal non -occupational life functions. Every attempt should be made to maintain the patient at maximal levels of activity, including work activities, as it is in the patient's best short te rm, as well as long term interest. Work activity limitations should be written whether the employer is perceived to have modified duty available or not. Written activity limitations guidance communicates the status of the patient, and also gives the patien t information on what he/she should or should not do at home. Table 3 provides recommendations on activity modification and duration of absence from work for C RPS. These guidelines are intended for patients without comorbidity or complicating factors, incl uding serious prior injuries. They are targets to provide a guide from the perspective of physiologic recovery. Individual cases will vary. Table 3. Guidelines for Modification of Work Activities and Duration of Restrictions Disorder Activity Modificatio ns and Accommodtion Recommended Target for Duration of Restrictions * Modified Duty Available Modified Duty Not Available Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (includes Types I and II) Use extremity as normally as possible. Avoid aggravating activities involving extremity (e.g., forceful prolonged use, heavy lifting, walking or standing). Advance activities as soon as possible for better outcomes. Must be strongly individualized based on the severity of CRPS. Mild 0 -30 days Moderate 30 -60 days Severe 60 -90 days Mild 0 -30 days Moderate 60 -90 days Severe 90 -180 days *Mild, moderate, and severe are defined by the degree to which the condition affects ADLs; e.g., mild involves little to no i mpairment in the impact on the patient's ability to perform ADLs, while severe involves marked impairment in the ability to perform ADLs. Durations of activity limitations may vary based on case -specific details. H. General Principles of Treatment The major principle is that CRPS almost always represent s an interaction among some level(s) of physical pathology (current or previous), pain beliefs, pain responses, genetics, prior or concurrent psychological problems, socioenvironmental factors, and work -site issues. To focus on one of these to the exclusion of others in treating patients is usually inappropriate and inadequate. The management of patients with CRPS chronic pain, hinges on supporting those activities and treatments which will improve overall function while remaining realistic about timelines a nd wide variations in reaching a functional recovery. It is important to explain the relevant anatomy and possible pain sources (or lack thereof) and seek to provide the optimal care to manage the pain and minimize dysfunction. Impairing pharmaceuticals an d interventional treatments outside of those with probabilities of substantial or complete recovery (or for short term exacerbations responsive to treatment) should be avoided. Their use should be seriously questioned in those cases when there are no evidence based medicine demonstrating efficacy. This is especially true given the extensive body of literature indicating that the placebo effect, expectation bias, and attention bias may be responsible for a significant amount of the benefit that is seen in conjunction with the use of many new interventions or adaptations of interventions used for other conditions . NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 36 The patient should be transitioned to work or modified work at the earliest date and highest level of function possible. He or she should be sup ported during that transition, and told of the likelihood of increased symptoms in conjunction with being reassured that pain does not equate to injury in the CRPS . Should it appear unlikely that there will be anything that can be done to cure the patient' s pain, he or she should be informed of that fact, which should be followed with advice that does not equate to disability or hopelessness by stressing that many people have similar conditions yet go to work every day, and take care of their family, leadin g normal (or nearly normal) lives. The providers' \"fear -avoidance beliefs\" regarding the relationship between pain complaints and patients' ability to return to work have been shown to affect their treatment practices . It is therefore imperative that the treating provider understand exactly what factors are or are not important in developing an appropriate \"return - to-work prescription.\"Providers should consider referral for further evaluation and perhaps cooperative treatment if: Specific clinical findings suggest previously undetecte d clinical pathology requiring other expertise to adequately address it. The clinical course does not follow generally expected patterns . Pain distribution is non -anatomic or described in a bizarre or atypical manner. Examples include glove - or stocking -like pain or paresthesias, shock -like pain, pain that radiates up and down the neck and back, burning pain, and pain that is present constan tly regardless of position, medication use, or physical treatments. Medication use does not decrease pain as expected, or increases pain. Appropriate active physical therapy does not appear to be improving function as expected. Complaints of pain or dysfun ction start to involve other body areas, including instances in which the patient: o Ceases to discuss returning to work in a specific time frame but rather in relation to a \"cure.\" o Fails to benefit from any, or all, rational therapeutic interventions. o Exper iences increased pain, or at the very least, pain does not decrease, over time. o Is unwilling to discuss his or her family situation . o States that the illness or injury has caused all of his or her problems. o Directs excessive anger at the employer or coworke rs, the provider, or an insurer and/or demonstrates an attitude of revenge or wanting to prove that he or she is sick. o Is less interested in the home therapy program or even in recovery of function. There appear to be indications of significant psychosocia l dysfunction or psychiatric comorbidity. Judicious referral may be warranted to corroborate the absence of physical pathology and to assure the patient that increased participation in usual activities will not be detrimental to his or her overall physica l status. This must be a referral to a well -qualified provider whose practice patterns are consistent with evidence -based medicine, as the potential to do harm by obtaining an MRI or other diagnostic study labeled \"abnormal\" based upon the presence of anat omic but clinically irrelevant findings is high. Such labeling may further reduce function and increase disability even if there is nothing abnormal for that person's age group . H.1 Specific Treatment Interventions NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 37 Studies evaluating the efficacy of a va riety of treatments in the management of various chronic pain disorders sometimes test interventions, especially medications, in patients with heterogeneous chronic pain disorders. The evidence base for these interventions is discussed in general terms, wi th individualized indications for use in management of a specific pain state provided when warranted. Treatment of specific disorders is discussed in other guidelines and that specific guidance takes precedent over this guidance. The emphasis and management of patients with CRPS is far different than that for acute pain from new physical injuries. For patients with CRPS rather than acute pain patients, the concentration on pain treatment with medications and invasive interventions is de -emphasized, while the focus should be on functional restoration. The three most important aspects of functional restoration include active patient engagement through interventions that: 1) change the patient's focus to functional recovery; 2) include aerobic and strengthening exercises; and 3) apply psychological interventions that include enhancing self -modulation of pain and distress. There are some invasive interventions with efficacy in limited circumstances. Treatments widely used in the management of CRPS , regardless of etiology, are medications, physical therapy, and occupational therapy (active and judicious use of passive interventions), coordinated multidisciplinary medical and psychological specialty pro grams, and certain types of injections. The following is the overall discussion of each intervention and information regarding the evidence -basis for recommendations. I. Treatment of CRPS I.1 Activity Modification and Exercise I.1.a Bed Rest for CRPS Not Recommended - for treatment of CRPS I.1.b Aerobic Exercise for CRPS Recommended - for treatment of CRPS Indications: All phases of CRPS. Consider aquatic therapy if largely or completely non -weight bearing status (see below). However, tho se with significant cardiac disease or significant potential for cardiovascular disease should be evaluated prior to instituting vigorous exercises, following the American College of Sports Medicine's Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription, 9th e d., in regards to health screening and risk stratification. Frequency/ Dose/Duration: Start with three to four visits a week to also include other exercises; demonstrate evidence of functional improvement within first two weeks to justify additional visits. Simultaneous home exercise prescription. Transition to home -based exercise program. Target minimum of 30 to 45 minutes/day at one time. When at 30 to 45minutes, increase pace. NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 38 I.1.c Strengthening Exercises for CRPS Recommended - for the treatment of CRPS Indications: All CRPS patients. Frequency/Dose/Duration: Typically start with three to five visits a week, with more visits for those more severely affected. Most severe CRPS patients will require daily treatments at first to encourage increased activity, progress exercises and address fear avoidant beliefs (\"kinesiophobia\") . Mild to moderate cases may be reasonably treated twice to three times weekly. Should have demonstrable evidence of functional improvement within first two weeks to justify additional visits. Supervised treatment frequency and duration is dependent on symptom severity and acuity and the presence of comorbid conditions. Transition to home exercises . Even in severe cases, active treatment regimens are recommended to be initiated at the first appointment (sometimes termed \"stress loading\"), merely supplemented with passive modalities as indicated. Those initiating treatment may well have increased symptoms for the first few days of treatment, however pain and edema should decrease within a few days. It is believed to be critical for the entire treatment team as well as the family to be aware of this and to continue to encourage the patient to continue to progress, rather than decrease or eliminate active program elements . There are many potential strength ening exercises and these are believed to be the most important programmatic elements in the treatment of a CRPS patient. A few examples of these activities include scrubbing, repeated forceful grasp, carrying of progressively heavier objects, distance walked, and repeated toe raises. Patients should be instru cted that strengthening exercises are the most important aspects of the treatment program, such exercises should be initiated at the first appoin tment, and home exercises should be strongly encouraged. It may be particularly helpful to monitor and graph the patient's progress through treatment sessions to demonstrate graphically that the endurance of pain is having meaningful benefits and used for motivational benefit. Activities that can be graphed include grip strength, amount or time of weight carry, time of scrubbing activity, numbers of repeated toe raises, and/or distance walked. Evidence for the Use of Exercise I.1.d Stretching Exercises for CRPS Recommended - for treatment of CRPS. Indications: Severe, chronic CRPS. May be indicated especially if the patient avoids all use of the extremity. Otherwise, better options are progressive strengthening and mirror and image therapy. Consider aquatic therapy if largely or completely non -weight bearing status (see below). Frequency/Dose/Duration: Start with three to four visits a week; advance exercises and demonstra te evidence of functional improvement. Quickly NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 39 advance to inclusion of strengthening exercises, aerobic exercises, mirror or image therapy or other functional exercise. Simultaneous home exercise prescription. Transition to home -based exercise program. I.1.e Mirror Therapy and Guided Imagery for CRPS Recommended - for motivated patients with moderate and severe CRPS who are willing to comply with the treatment. Indications : Moderate and severe cases of CRPS. May be particularly helpful for those having difficulty complying with progressive strengthening exercises. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Home exercises requiring an estimated ten minutes of each waking hour for six weeks. Best results obtained from viewing unaffected limb and performing ac tivities as fast and accurately as possible with affected hand. Clinic appointments are needed and are estimated at least three times a week for six weeks in addition to home exercises. In the event of ongoing improvements and need for additional appointm ents, additional treatments to continue the therapy would be indicated in two to three week increments provided there was continuing objective evidence of ongoing improvement after each additional increment. Evidence for the Use of Motor Imagery Programs I.1.f Aquatic Therapy for CRPS Recommended - for patients with CRPS to develop increasing tolerance to graded activities. Indications : Moderate to severe CRPS patients. Includes those with underlying morbidity making weight bearing problematic (e.g., severe lower extremity degenerative joint disease) or those who previously exercised by swimming etc. Particularly includes those with lower extremity CRPS that is severe with weight bearing difficulty. May also include those with severe upper extremity CRPS. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Appointments initially three times a week, but five times a week if severe CRPS. Home exercises should be simultaneou sly prescribed. I.1.g Desensitization Techniques for CRPS Recommended - for the treatment of CRPS. Indications: Moderate to severe CRPS patients with significant hyperalgesia. Should be primarily engaged in a core program of graded strengthening exercises or for whom there is a plan to implement such exercises shortly after or in conjunction with desensitization techniques. (Desensitization techniques are unlikely to be successful for functional restoration and are not recommended as a sole exercise or therapy intervention.) NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 40 Frequency/Dose/Duration: Appointments initially three times a week, but five times a week if severe CRPS. Home exercises should be simultaneously prescribed. Evidence fo Desensitization Techniques for CRPS I.1.h Yoga for CRPS Recommended - for treatment of CRPS. Indications : Moderate to severe CRPS patients. Particularly indicated for those who are motivated and interested in yoga. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Appointments initially three times a week, but five times a week if severe CRPS. Daily home exercises should be simultaneously prescribed. J. Medications for the Treatment of CRPS J.1 Oral NSAIDs Recommended - for the treatment of CRPS. Indications: CRPS sufficiently severe to require medication. NSAIDs are recommended as an adjunct to strengthening, conditioning and aerobic exercises. Generally, generic ibuprofen, naproxen or oth er older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen is a reasonable alternative, or can be used as an adjunct, although evidence suggests it is modestly less efficacious. Over -the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tried first. Second -line medications may include other generic medications. COX -2 selective agents are recommended as a third - or fourth -line medications when there are contraindications for other NSAIDs and/or there are risks of GI complications; howeve r, concomitant treatment with misoprostol, sucralfate, and proton pump inhibitors are also options for gastro -protection. Please see warnings related to NSAIDs in the Non -Acute Pain Medical Treatment Guideline. Frequency/Dose/Duration: For most patients , scheduled dosage, rather than as needed, is preferred to avoid adverse effects of other treatment options, but prescribing NSAIDs as needed is reasonable for mild or moderate symptoms. Due to the potential adverse effects from chronic use (more than two months) of NSAIDs, patients should be periodically monitored for adverse effects such as hypertension, blood loss, renal insufficiency (as manifested by an increased creatinine), and hepatic enzyme elevations. Older patients and those with co -morbidities m ay require more frequent monitoring. Use of an adjunctive cytoprotective agent may also be warranted. J.2 Acetaminophen for CRPS Recommended - for treatment of particularly if NSAIDs are contraindicated. NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 41 Indications : CRPS sufficiently severe to require medication. Acetaminophen is recommended as an adjunct to strengthening, conditioning and aerobic exercises. Generally, generic ibuprofen, naproxen or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medicati ons. Acetaminophen is a reasonable alternative, or can be used as an adjunct, although evidence suggests it is modestly less efficacious. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Generally prescribed up to 3.5g/day in divided doses, usually four times a day dosing . Evidence for the Use of NSAIDs and NSAIDs regional blockades that also include lidocaine and clonidine for treatment of CRPS. Indications : Severe CRPS that has responded insufficiently to progressive strengthening exercises, aerobic exercises and oral medications, generally including bisphosphonates. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Three injections at weekly intervals. J.4 Anti for treatment of CRPS. Indications: Chronic pain not fully treated with progressive strengthening, aerobic exercises and generally NSAIDs. May be particularly helpful if there is nocturnal sleep disrupt ion and mild dysthymia, which may allow for nocturnal dosing of a mildly sedating tricyclic anti -depressant. Frequency/Dose/Duration: Prescribe at a low dose at night and gradually increase (e.g., amitriptyline 25mg QHS, increase by 25mg each week) until a sub -maximal or maximal dose is achieved, sufficient effects are achieved, or adverse effects occur. Generally, lower doses (e.g., amitriptyline 25 to 75mg a day) to avoid adverse effects and necessity of blood level monitoring, particularly as there is no evidence of increased pain relief at higher doses. For CRPS, duration may be indefinite, although most patients do not require indefinite treatment as the condition usually improves or resolves spontaneously. Imipramine is less sedating, thus i f there is carryover daytime sedation, it may be a better option. If the patient cannot sleep, amitriptyline is recommended as the initial medication to prescribe. J.5 Duloxetine for CRPS Recommended - a trial of duloxetine for treatment of CRPS after attempting other treatments (e.g., strengthening exercises, aerobic exercise, bisphosphonates) and if TCAs are not tolerated , and if treatment efficacy can be documented . NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 42 Indications: CRPS that is sufficie nt to require medication. Generally should also have failed multiple other modalities including progressive strengthening exercise, aerobic exercise, NSAIDs, tricyclic anti -depressants, and anti -convulsant agents. Frequency/Dose/Duration: 60mg daily. There appears to be either a minimal or no advantage of the twice daily dosing over the 60mg daily dosing . Duration for patients with CRPS pain may be as long as indefinitely, although some patients do not require indefinite treatment, particularly if they are compliant with a functional restoration program. J.6 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), Bupropion, or Trazodone for CRPS Not Recommended - for treatment of CRPS without depression. (They may be recommended to treat depression , please see Medical Treatment Guideline for Work - Related Depression and Depressive Disorders .) J.7 Antipsychotics for CRPS or CRPS -Related Neuropathic CRPS -related neuropathic pain. J.8 Anti-Convulsant Agents for CRPS Recommended - for treatment of severe CRPS is selectively recommended after attempted management with NSAIDs, other medications , and a progressive exercise program , and if treatment efficacy can be documented . Indications: Generally not indicated, but may be a consideration for severe chronic CRPS as a fourth - or fifth -line agent, and initiated by practitioners familiar with their use and able to monitor patients closely for adverse effects. Treatments that should be attemp ted first include progressive strengthening and aerobic exercises that should be continued. Other prior treatment considerations include other exercises, NSAIDs, bisphosphonates and anti -depressants (TCA and SNRI). Frequency/Dose/Duration: Frequency and dosing per manufacturer. Duration for CRPS patients may be indefinitely, although most of these patients do not require indefinite treatment as the condition usually improves or resolves spontaneously. J.9 Gabapentin / Pregabalin (Short Term) for CRPS Recommended - for treatment of moderate to severe CRPS if other therapies have proven insufficient to control symptoms. Indications: CRPS in whom other methods to control symptoms have been proven to be un successful, including strengthening exercises, aerobic exercises, other exercises, NSAIDs, physical therapy/occupational therapy, bisphosphonates, clonidine, and tricyclic anti -depressants. Should be used as an adjunct to a functional restoration NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 43 program t o facilitate the program advancement for the four weeks that the medication shows some evidence of efficacy. There is no recommendation for ongoing treatment beyond one course. Frequency/Dose/Duration: One suggested regimen is: gabapentin 600mg daily fo r two days, then 600mg twice daily for two days, then 600mg three times a day for days five to 21. Dose escalation should be cautiously done to avoid adverse effects which may outweigh benefits. Duration of use for CRPS patients is usually limited as most of these patients do not require indefinite treatment. The condition usually improves or resolves spontaneously. However, the efficacy of gabapentin has been labeled as \"mild\" for CRPS and quality evidence suggests that benefits are short -term. Evidence for the Use of Gabapentin or Pregab alin for CRPS J.10 Bisphosphonates for CRPS Recommended - for patients with CRPS after physical therapy interventions have been trialed. Indications: Moderate or severe CRPS, including in acute to subacute as well as chronic phases. Should be included as part of functional restoration plan where strengthening, aerobic and other functional exercises are central foci of prescriptions. Frequency/Dose/D uration: Taken in oral or parenteral formulations. Recommended treatment regimen s have included: Alendronate 40mg daily for eight for one dose; Neridronate 100-mg IV every ten days for 40 days. Duration for oral treatment of CRPS patients may be indefinite, although most do not require indefinite treatment as the condition usually gradually improves or in some cases resolves spontaneously. Evidence for the Use of Bisphosphonates J.11 Calcitonin for CRPS Recommended - as a treatment option for CRPS patients. Indications: Severe CRPS with inadequate symptom relief with strengthening, aerobic exercise, NSAIDs, corticosteroids, tricyclic anti -depressants, active physical and/or occupational therapy, and bisphosphonates. Frequency/Dose/Duration: Dosing in the quality trials were intranasal calcitonin: 100IU three times a day for three weeks , 400IU daily for four weeks , and 200 IU daily plus calcium 500mg a day . Duration of use for CRPS patients may be indefinite, although most do not require this as the condition usually improves or resolves spontaneously. Evidence for the Use of Calcitonin J.12 Clonidine for CRPS NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 44 Recommended - administered by oral or regional blockade for treatment of moderately severe CRPS that is not responsive to rehabilitative therapy, NSAIDs, tricyclic anti -depressants, or glucocorticosteroids. Indications: Severe CRPS that is not responsive to strengthening exercises, aerobic exercise, other exe rcise, NSAIDs, bisphosphonates, tricyclic anti -depressants, and glucocorticosteroids. Frequency/Dose/Duration: Three weekly intervals. The single quality used: 30g clonidine . parecoxib is not available in the US, other NSAIDs could be considered. Evidence for the Use of Clonidine J.12.a Intravenous Regional Anesthesia with Clonidine for Preventive Administration Prior to Surgery Recommended - for administration prior to surgery to prevent recurrence of CRPS in patients who have previously had CRPS. It may also be considered in patients undergoing surgery who are considered at increased risk for CRPS. Indications: Patients undergoing surgery who have a prior history of CRPS. May be considered for those at high risk for CRPS . Evidence for Intravenous Regional Anesthesia with Clonidine J.13 Oral Glucocorticosteroids for CRPS Recommended - for short -term treat ment of CRPS. Indications: Moderate to severe CRPS with symptoms insufficiently controlled with progressive strengthening, aerobic and other active exercises, and NSAIDs. Bisphosphonates are another reasonable option at this stage. Few patients with mild CRPS may be candidates, es pecially if there is a lack of progress or worsening of symptoms. Frequency/Dose/Duration: One regimen used was Prednisolone 40mg orally daily for 14 days and then 10 mg/week taper . A second regimen was prednisone 10mg orally three times a day for up to 12 weeks . There is no comparative evidence to suggest which regimen is superior. If there is significant improvement in objective findings and an additional treatment is felt to be indicated, it appears reasonable to continue treatment for an additional two months. Subsequent treatment should be individualized based on ongoing improvements, and inadequacy of progressive exercises , and after risk/benefit considerations have been made regarding continued glucocorticoster oid therapy . Evidence for the Use of J.14 Intrathecal Glucocorticosteroids for CRPS NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 45 Not Recommended - for treatment of CRPS. Evidence fo the Use of Intrathecal Glucocorticosteroids J.15 Ketamine Infusion for CRPS Not treatment of CRPS. J.16 Ketanserin for CRPS Not Recommended - for treatment of CRPS. J.17 Magnesium Sulfate for CRPS Not Recommended - for treatment of CRPS. Evidence for the Use of Magnesium Sulfate J.18 NMDA Receptor/Antagonists for CRPS Not Recommended - including dextromethorphan, are not recommended for treatment of CRPS. J.19 Muscle Relaxants for CRPS Not Recommended - of CRPS. J.20 Thalidomide and Lenalidomide for CRPS Not Recommended - for the treatment of CRPS or any other chronic pain syndrome. Evidence for The Use of Lenalidomide J.21 Capsicum Creams for CRPS Not Recommended - for treatment of CRPS. J.22 DMSO for CRPS Recommended - for treatment of CRPS. Indic ations: CRPS that is sufficient to require medication. Generally should also have failed multiple other modalities including progressive strengthening exercise, aerobic exercise, NSAIDs, tricyclic bisphosphonates, and anti-convulsant agents . - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 46 Frequency/Dose/Duration: DMSO applied 50% five times a day to affected extremity. Duration in the highest quality study was 17 weeks . Some patients do not require lengthy treatment, particularly if they are compliant with a functional restoration program which should be the key focus of the treatment program. Evidence for the Use of DMSO J.23 N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) for CRPS Recommended - for treatment of CRPS as an adjunct to an active therapy and exercise program. Indications: CRPS that is sufficient to require medication. Generally should also have failed multiple other modalities including progressive strengthening exercise, aerobic exercise, NSAIDs, tricyclic 600mg orally three times a day . Duration in the quality trial was 17 weeks . Some patients do not require lengthy treatment, particularly if they are compliant with a functional restoration program which should be the key focus of the treatment program. Evidence for the Use of Dimethyl Sulfoxide, N -Acetylcysteine, and EMLA Cream J.24 EMLA Cream Not Recommended - for tre atment of CRPS. J.25 Tumor Necrosis Factor -alpha Blockers for J.26 Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) for CRPS treatment of CRPS. Indications: Severe CRPS had pain intensity greater than four on an 11 point (0 to 10) numerical rating scale; having had CRPS for six to 30 months; refractory to treatment with all of: strengthening exercises, 0.25 g/kg for one day and the same dose repeated on the following day . Frequency of a second course is unclear, as the sole quality trial lasted one month and the data suggest at least some of the benefits were still present at 30 day . Evidence for the Use of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 47 J.27 Vitamin C for Prevention of CRPS in Patients with Distal Radius, Wrist, Hand, Ankle and Foot Fractures Recommended - for the prevention/treatment of CRPS in select patients with fractures of the di stal radius, wrist, hand, ankle and foot.

NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 49 Indications: CRPS sufficient to require treatments beyond exercises and potentially medicat ion. Applications should be home -based as there is no evidence for efficacy of provider -based heat treatments. Primary emphasis should generally be on compliance with progressive strengthening and aerobic exercises as part of a functional restoration progr am elements, rather than on passive treatments in patients with chronic pain which could be detrimental. Frequency/Dose/Duration: Self-applications may be periodic, generally up to a few times a day. Education regarding home heat application should be part of the treatment plan if heat has been effective for reducing pain.

Evidence for the Use of Guanethidine, or Reserpine Bier Blocks K.17.l Intrathecal Drug Delivery Systems for Chronic Persistent Pain Recommended - as a treatment of last resort for the treatment of CRPS in select patients who have proven refractory to multiple other (generally more conservative and less invasive ) modalities . Targeted drug delivery (Pain Pumps) is not included on the list of pre- authorized procedures. Providers who want to perform this p rocedure must request pre - authorization from the carrier before performing the procedure. To be pre -authorized, the patient must be evaluated and have the recommendation of at least one physician certified in chronic pain management in consultation with the primary treating physician. NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 52 The procedure must be performed by a physician with documented experience in the performance of this procedure. Indications: Targeted drug delivery using intrathecal pump can be considered as a treatment of last resort in CRPS patients with severe, chronic, intractable pain recalcitrant to all conservative treatment options . The small eligible sub -group of patients must meet all of the following indications: A diagnosis of CRPS has been made on the basis of objective findings; andAll reasonable surgical and non - surgical treatment has been exhausted including failure of conservative therapy including active and/or passive therapy, medication management, or therapeutic injections; and There are n o practical issues that might interfere w ith device placement, maintenance, or assessment (e.g., morbid obesity, body size insufficient to support the size and weight of the implanted device, severe cognitive impairment); and Pre-trial psychiatric or psychological evaluation has been performed ( as for SCS) and should demonstrate the following: o No primary psychiatric risk factors or red flags; o Motivation and adherence to prescribed treatments; o There is no evidence of current addictive behavior (tolerance and dependence to opioid analgesics are not addictive behaviors and do not preclude implantation). Recommend that before a pain pump trial is considered, the patient be offered treatment at a functional restoration program if available. All the evaluation criteria must be succes sfully met before a screening trial is scheduled. K.17.m Pain Pump Screen Trial A successful trial of continuous infusion by a percutaneous spinal infusion pump for a minimum of 24 hours or a bolus trial as an outpatient is required to ascertain effectiveness and make sure there are no side effects . A screening test is considered successful if the patient: NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 53 Experiences a 50% decrease in pain, which may be confirmed by VAS, and Demonstrat es objective functional gains or decrased utilization of pain medications, and Objective functional gains should be evaluated and documented prior to and before discontinuationof the trail. K.17.n Pain Pump Implantation If the screening trial is successful, the treating physician must request pre - authorization from the carrier to implant a permanent pain pump. L. Surgical Considerations L.1 Spinal Cord Stimulators for Short - to Intermediate -term Relief of CRPS Recommended - as an option for highly select CRPS patients who understand that this intervention has no quality evidence of greater than 3 year benefit during which time there is unequivocal patient commitment. Indications : See Table 4. Frequency/Dose/Duration : N/A Evidence for the Use of Spinal Cord Stimulators Table 4 Selection Criteria for Implantable Spinal Cord Stimulation in a CRPS Patient* 1. Clear diagnosis of CRPS based on criteria that include objective measures, such as the Consensus Criteria. 2. Poor response to conservative treatment generally for at least 6 months,** including treatment in an experienced interdisciplinary clinic with proven good outcomes that included elements of a functional restorative program and for which the patient demonstrated good motivation. 3. Remedial surgery inadvisable or not feasible. 4. Major psychiatric disorders have been treated with expected responses. Somatization disorder not amenable to treatment will disqualify the patient for use of invasive procedures, as the risk of the procedure is higher than the expected succ ess rate. The candidate should have a successful independent, psychological evaluation and a structured interview performed by a psychologist specialized in chronic pain management including appropriate psychometric testing. (The psychological evaluation should be performed by a practitioner who is not employed by the requesting or treating physicians).*** 5. Willingness to stop inappropriate drug use before implantation. 6. No indication that secondary gain is directly influencing pain or disability complaints. 7. Ability to give informed consent for the procedure. 8. Successful results of at least 50% pain reduction from a trial of a temporary external stimulator of approximately 2 -3 days and reduction of use of opioid medication or other me dication with significant NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 54 adverse effects or functional improvement such as return to work that may be evaluated by an occupational or physical therapist prior to and before discontinuation of the trial. *Adapted from Kumar K, Hunter G, Demeria D.

L.2 Amputation for CRPS Not Recommended - for the treatment of CRPS. M. Rehabilitation There are many different types of rehabilitation programs. To help organize and present a hierarchical construct, rehabilitation is classified in this g uideline as primary, secondary, or tertiary. Primary rehabilitation includes the most widely encountered therapy and consist s of a relatively minimal quantity(ies) of medical care coupled with physical therapy, occupational therapy or healthcare provider directed exercises (i.e., a home exercise program). While there is much diversity, typical strategies commonly include teachi ng specific stretches, graded exercises, addressing fear avoidant beliefs (\"kinesiophobia\") , and advancing activity levels, generally in the acute to subacute phases, until recovery is complete. Secondary rehabilitation usually occurs after either failu re of primary rehabilitation and/or a determination that the healing course will not result in bridging a gap between current abilities and job physical demands. Secondary rehabilitation includes more advanced and contact time-intensive rehabilitative tre atments and are most commonly termed Work Conditioning and Work Hardening. Work Conditioning usually emphasizes exercises and includes tasks to simulate work activities. Work Hardening typically includes progressive exercise but adds some limited psychol ogical counseling and education. Tertiary rehabilitation involves interdisciplinary rehabilitation. There are many different terms and emphases of tertiary rehabilitation programs; however, they can generally be classified into pain programs and functional restoration programs. These programs generally employ multiple disciplines using biopsychosocial ap proaches to address pain, function, work, and psychological distress. There are some quality trials of tertiary rehabilitation programs and guidance is included in this section. Initiation of these programs may be considered in the subacute stage if di sability is not adequately explained by physical findings and primary rehabilitation treatments have failed to significantly improve the functional status. Chronicity by itself is a major predictor of poor outcome. The longer it takes to resolve the disability (delayed recovery), the more likely patients ar e to never return to normal or near -normal function or to work . Functional restoration is both a type of interdisciplinary pain management and rehabilitation program, as well as a general approach to medical care. Fundamental elements of a functional restoration approach include assessment of the patient's dynamic physical and functional status including traditional tests for strength, sensation, and range of motion. Psychosocial strengths and stressors must also be assessed (including a history of child hood abuse, anger, NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 55 fear of reinjury, and a history of substance misuse), and the patient's support system, evidence of mood disorders, assessment of education and skills, medication use, presence of litigation, and work incapacity analyzed. Following this evaluation, the emphasis is on expectation management, directed conditioning and exercise, CBT, functional goal setting and decrease in medication use. An ongoing assessment of patient participation and compliance (with documentation of complicating proble ms and progress toward specific goals, including reduction in disability and medical utilization) is needed. In functional restoration, the treatment team functions more as educators and coaches, not \"treaters\". Passive therapies and invasive intervention s are de -emphasized in favor of home exercise/self -management techniques. There should be a shift of health, function, and well - being responsibility (locus of control) from physicians and therapists to the individual. A functional restoration approach may include the limited/adjunctive use of medications and interventional measures (where specifically indicated); however, these should not be viewed as ongoing solutions, and used to support the patient's active participation in rehabilitation. Rehabilitation should include instruction in preventive measures, education for relapse prevention, proper activity and work pacing, ergonomic accommodation, and when appropriate, recommend transitional return to employment. The goal is a mitigation of a patient's suffering and his or her return to a productive life despite having a chronic pain problem. If an individual has risk factors for delayed recovery or fails to recover within the appropriate biological healing time fr ame, the acute care paradigms of specific diagnosis and treatment change to biopsychosocial approaches that address pain, function, work, and psychological factors impeding progress. Treatment programs focus on restoration of work -related function. These p rograms include work conditioning and work hardening, interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation programs and functional rehabilitation. Because functional restoration is an approach, not just a specific program, the approaches taken both overlap and are on a c ontinuum. There is no unified agreement on definitions for work conditioning and work hardening, and sometimes the terms are used interchangeably. Work conditioning has been defined by the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) as \"an intensive, w ork-related, goal -oriented conditioning program designed specifically to restore systemic neuromusculoskeletal functions (e.g., joint integrity and mobility, muscle performance (including strength, power, and endurance), motor function (motor control and motor learning), range of motion (including muscle length), and cardiovascular/pulmonary functions (e.g., aerobic capacity/endurance, circulation, and ventilation and respiration/gas exchange). Work hardening has been defined by APTA as a \"highly structur ed, goal -oriented, individualized intervention program designed to return the patient/client to work. Work Hardening programs, which are multidisciplinary in nature, use real or simulated work activities designed to restore physical, behavioral, and vocati onal functions. Work Hardening addresses the issues of productivity, safety, physical tolerances, and worker behaviors.\" Thus, work conditioning is classified as a single -discipline program and work hardening program as interdisciplinary. The Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF) defines occupational rehabilitation as work conditioning, and comprehensive occupational rehabilitation as work hardening. Although not universally accepted, some physicians consider work conditioning a s NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 56 a generalized endurance and strengthening program that includes work simulation activities, whereas work hardening is a program where a specific job has been identified and stresses involvement in sets of occupationally -related tasks and functional activ ities that are directly related to a patient's work. Work conditioning programs in the U.S. are most often provided by a single -therapy discipline, either physical or occupational therapy. Early identification and appropriate management of patients exhibi ting signs of delayed recovery is believed to decrease the likelihood that symptoms will become chronic. Patients who are identified at risk for delayed recovery may benefit from a limited but intense program of physical restoration and education, including management of barriers to recovery and return to work. These patients may require an abbreviated early intervention interdisciplinary rehabilitation program (IPRP based on functional res toration principles, rather than a longer program utilized for more complex cases. Early intervention programs are an alternative to work conditioning and work hardening programs for subacute or early patients with chronic pain who have evidence for delaye d recovery with an increased need for education and psychological assessment and intervention. These programs are usually begun when a significant gap is identified between functional abilities and job demands, ideally in the early subacute time (e.g., 30 -60 days). An IPRP may also be justified earlier if risk factors for delayed recovery are identified. The interdisciplinary functional restoration program used for early intervention contains the features of a functional restoration program, but involves lo wer intensity and duration of services than a program used for patients with greater chronicity or intensity of disability. The type, intensity, and duration of services should be dictated by the patient's unique rehabilitation needs. These services may be used for patients who fail work conditioning and work hardening programs, usually within six months of onset of disability post-injury. The time frame of three to six months post -injury (or earlier if risk factors for delayed recovery are identified) is v ital for intervening with the most effective treatment possible in order to avoid the negative sequelae that come with increasing duration of disability. During this time frame, normal musculoskeletal healing will generally have occurred, eliminating any r emaining physical barriers to intensive rehabilitation. Such programs are appropriate for prevention, before the patient is entrenched in a chronic pain syndrome or before severe pain and illness behavior evolves. M.1 Work Conditioning, Work Hardening, Ea rly Intervention Programs for C RPS Recommended - for treatment of CRPS patients. Indications: Patients who: 1) remain completely off work or are on modified duty for 6 to 12 weeks, most commonly due to manual materials handling tasks; 2) have not responded to less costly interventions including a four to six week physical therapy program or a grade d therapy program of at least six to eight weeks that includes aerobic and strengthening exercise components; 3) have a stated strong interest and expectation to return to work; 4) involve cooperation of the employer; 5) are supervised by a qualified physi cal or occupational therapist; 6) have had a careful assessment of their occupational demands; 7) have had either inability to return to work or a FCE that indicated appropriate performance effort and consistency at a level of work lower than that to which they need or wish to return ; and 8) are in a program that includes a cognitive -behavioral approach with a focus on function rather than pain , a conditioning or aerobic exercise component and simulated graded work tasks, and is tailored to NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 57 their needs and identifies gaps between current capabilities and job demands. Incorporation of FABT is often helpful. Frequency/Dose/Duration: Work conditio ning and early intervention programs three to five times a week; work hardening daily. Weekly evaluations demonstrating compliance and functionally significant progress towards the return -to-work goal must be documented to justify continuation. Program len gth and intensity should be dictated by each patient's unique rehabilitation needs. Evidence for Work Conditioning, Work Harden ing, and Early Intervention Programs M.2 Tertiary Pain Programs: Interdisciplinary Pain Rehabilitation Programs, Multidisciplinary Rehabilitation Programs, Chronic Pain Management Programs, and Functional Restoration Programs Recommended - selectively for patients with CRPS who have failed conventional treatments and remain significantly incapacitated. Indications : The decision to admit the patient to a tertiary pain program should be based on all of the following criteria: 1. Patients are e ither completely off work or on modified duty for at least three months and trending towards unusually slow and delayed functional recovery 2. There is a known etiology to the chronic pain syndrome or specific clinical condition which includes physical injury or disease. 3. Other appropriate medical and/or invasive care has been attempted and proved to be inadequate to restore functional status. 4. The patient has appropriate rehabilitation potential (i.e., he or she is judged to be able to substantially benefit fro m the program). 5. The patient is not responding to other interventions including quality physical therapy programs; 6. The patient has at least some behavioral or psychosocial issues affecting their recovery. For workers without behaviorally related issues and merely a physical gap between the current capabilities and future job requirements, work conditioning/work hardening programs are usually both more appropriate and cost effective. 7. The patient has substantial gaps between current physical capabilities and actual or projected occupational demands 8. There are no known contraindications to the treatment program, e.g., certain unstable medical conditions, primary substance abuse disorder or cognitive limitation which would prevent appropriate learning. 9. The patien t is committed to recovery. Frequency/Dose/Duration: Progressive physical activity, which incorporates exercise intended to move the patient toward a home fitness maintenance program and a gradual increase in personal and occupational functional tasks. Tertiary pain program treatment is generally five full days a week. Treatment program length is determined by the severity of deficits, speed of progress, cessation of healing (or reaching a NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 58 \"plateau\"), and thus are somewhat individualize d. Typical lengths are four to five weeks. Complicating problems such as coordinating with part -time work, transportation, child care, extreme physical deficits, high -dose opioids, or limitations imposed by comorbid medical conditions are considerations t hat may necessitate a slower approach to program participation and longer treatment duration. Treatment Objectives. Appropriate treatment objectives must include the following which have to be regularly assessed and documented: 1. Functional improvement. This should emphasize those physical parameters which have been assessed as \"pain limited.\" While general or aerobic conditioning is appropriate for most patients, there should be evidence of progress in the specific areas where dysfunction o r deficits have been present. 2. Improvement in activities of daily living. These are unique to each patient and goals should also be relevant to \"pain limited\" activities. 3. Relevant psychosocial improvements. Objective improvement in patient's psychosocial fu nctioning should be evident. 4. Withdrawal from opioid, sedative -hypnotic, and muscle relaxant medications. This is a requirement, absent specific indications. A history of adequate functional improvement associated with opioid medications would not by itself result in referral to a tertiary pain program unless excessively high doses of medications are being used with associated physical and psychological dysfunction. 5. Medical management. All other medications should be continually reviewed and adjusted as nece ssary. 6. Return to work or other productive activity. Appropriate assessment, counseling, planning, and skill development should begin early in the program with efforts directed at identifying if it is reasonable for the patient to return to work. Inpatient Care. Nearly all patients can be treated on an ambulatory basis. In the rare circumstances where hospitalization is required, this should be under the control of or closely coordinated with a tertiary pain program physician. Indications for inpatient car e include any of the following: 1. detoxification on an outpatient basis may present unacceptable medical risk; 2. medical instability; 3. the evaluation suggests that treatment may exacerbate pain/illness behavior to the extent that there is a risk of injury or re nder florid manifestation of a major psychiatric disorder; 4. 24-hour nursing care is required; 5. extreme pain behavior and dysfunction that makes outpatient care not feasible and there is reasonable evidence presented by the evaluating pain team that a brief i npatient stay will enable transfer to an outpatient tertiary pain program. Other Functional Restoration. At times, patients may require functional restoration, but find that either a formal program does not exist or it is not appropriate due to medical or social issues. In such cases, functional restoration can sometimes be accomplished, provided the patient requires treatment for specific clinical indications with the services which are to be provided. At a minimum, there should be appropriate indications for behavioral/psychological treatment, physical or occupational therapy, and at least one other rehabili tation oriented discipline. Care must be coordinated by a NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 59 physician appropriately qualified and experienced to provide and supervise rehabilitation services or functional restoration. Criteria for the provision of such services should include: 1. Satisfaction of the criteria for coordinated functional restoration care as appropriate to the case; 2. A level of disability or dysfunction which does not require treatment in a formal program; 3. No drug dependence or problematic or significant opioid usage; and 4. A clinical problem for which return to work can be anticipated upon completion of the services. Follow -up. Regular or intensive formal treatment is not usually necessary after successful discharge from a tertiary pain program. However, it is important that patients continue a self -directed home program of physical restorative and psychological pain management approaches learned during the tertiary pain program. Routine follow -up should be provided to assess the durability of the functional restoration achie ved, with a long -term-care plan established to facilitate management by the treating physician. Evidence for Interdisciplinary Work Rehabilit ation Programs Evidence for Interdisciplinary Pain Rehabilitation Programs Evidence for Multidisciplinary Rehabilitation Programs Evidence for Chronic Pain Management Programs Evidence for Other Functional Restoration Programs N. Behavorial Interventions Pain is a psychological phenomenon that is influenced by a myriad of biomedical and psychosocial factors. An approach to pain assessment that has shown considerable promise has been the assessment of cognitions related to pain, particularly the assessment of pain catastrophizing and fear avoidance (i.e. kinesiophobia). This approach naturally leads to behavioral interventions. The traditional approach to assessing and treating pain uses an ordinal pain scale (0 to 10). Unfortunately, a patient's pain repo rt may be confounded by a variety of variables including: 1) the perception of pain, and especially chronic pain has a low correlation with pathophysiology, 2) the perception of pain is influenced by psychological variables such as mood, arousal, attention and cognition, and 3) the patient may be incentivized to alter reports of pain. Thus, there is increasing use of function -centered questionnaires to determine the degree to which pain impacts function, although these too are usually subjective. When pat ients are assessed psychologically, pain problems are generally evaluated with various psychological instruments that provide qualitative and quantitative inferences about the patient's perceptions and related behaviors. Addressing pain -related dysfunctio n, psychological comorbidities (e.g., anxiety, fear, depression, anger, hopelessness, stress) and engaging in problem solving to address social roadblocks to recovery is usually more helpful NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 60 than focusing on analgesia. One treatment approach with considera ble evidence of success is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT recognizes the pain, but works to change the patient's negative thoughts about the pain and its impacts, including the development of constructive skills, coping and behaviors related to t he pain. The way in which the provider manages the patient with delayed recovery may affect the degree to which chronic pain behaviors develop. As pain is a biopsychosocial phenomenon, a formal psychological evaluation (which may include appropriate diagnostic psychological testing) may be helpful (see below). In addition to identifying psychological risk factors, the identification of any social risk factors is also important . Social risk factors may include work - related issues such as job satisfaction or co -worker support, family reinforcement of pain behaviors or lack of support, and legal/financial incentives for poor recovery. Additionally, cultural beliefs regarding origins of disease and health care patterns may also influence presentation and recovery. These should be addressed in a positive, cooperative and sensitive manner to facilitate recovery and minimize the chance of physical debilitation and chronic or long-term disability . Treating CRPS requires specialized knowledge, sub stantial time, and access to multiple disciplines if not multidisciplinary care. Judicious involvement of other health care professionals (e.g., psychologists, occupational and physical therapists, etc.) who can offer diagnostic assessments and additional therapies where indicated, while the provider continues to direct the therapeutic process to maximize functional restoration. Close communication between all treating professionals is essential. Psychological evaluation and treatment should be strongly co nsidered for patients with CRPS. Since such patients often present difficulties in diagnosis, rehabilitation, appropriateness for invasive procedures, and return to work planning, consultation can be helpful in these areas. Additionally, through behavior al medicine even those with relatively low levels of formal psychopathology may learn better ways of self -managing symptoms and therefore optimize their pain outcomes. As well, those with subacute pain who are not improving as expected are also candidates for psychological evaluation to improve function and to develop a plan to avoid chronic pain behaviors. Psychological or behavioral treatments are commonly provided to patients with CRPS. Patients who should be more strongly considered for these service s include those with one or more of the following: delayed recovery, ineffective pain coping skills, psychological disorder(s), insomnia, stress -related psychophysiological responses such as muscular bracing, problematic medication use, excessive fear avoi dant beliefs, and/or non -adherence with prior physical activity or other prescriptions. Where indicated, this has been typically provided with cognitive -behavior therapy (CBT). This is a type of psychotherapy which emphasizes the relationship of cognitions , behaviors, and mood to physical symptoms in an attempt to promote specific therapeutic goals. CBT techniques generally employ \"homework\" assignments in addition to direct psychotherapeutic treatment, and because of that CBT protocols have varying require ments for literacy. The provision of therapy does not generally require an ICD -10 diagnosis, though this is often obtained in patients with CRPS , and many such patients may meet criteria for various diagnoses. Other diagnoses frequently include insomnia, p ost traumatic stress disorder, somatoform disorders, depression and/or anxiety disorders. Note that CBT treatments for chronic pain, depression, insomnia etc. are distinct therapies with unique protocols. NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 61 N.1 Psychological Evaluation for CRPS Patients Recommended - as part of the evaluation and management of patients with chronic pain in order to identify psychosocial barriers that are contributing to disability and inhibiting function and to assess whether psychological factors will need to be considered and treated as part of the overall treatment plan. Indications: Moderate to severe CRPS in which : 1. Cases in which significant psychosocial dysfunction is observed or suspected. 2. The provider has need to understand psychosocial factors contri buting to the patient's pain reports and disability behaviors 3. Inadequate recovery: This includes continued dysfunctional status despite a duration which exceeds the typical course of recovery; failure to benefit from indicated therapies or to return to wor k when medically indicated; or a persistent pain problem which is inadequately explained by the patient's physical findings. 4. Medication issues and/or drug problems: This includes any suspicion of drug overuse or misuse, aberrant drug behavior, substance ab use, addiction, or use of illicit substance, or for consideration of chronic use of opioids. 5. Current or premorbid history of major psychiatric symptoms or disorder. 6. Problems with compliance/adherence with prescribed medical treatment or rehabilitation pro gram: For evaluation of candidly for or potential benefit from a proposed functional restoration program, e.g., comprehensive occupational rehabilitation or interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation (see Functional Restoration). 7. Evidence of possible cognitive impairment which is associated with related significant ADL dysfunction: This may be secondary to injury and/or possible adverse effects of medical therapies initiated for the chronic pain. 8. Catastrophic injuries with significant pain related or other dysfu nction, e.g., spinal cord injury. 9. Cases for which certain procedures are contemplated, e.g., back surgery or spinal cord stimulation. Frequency/Dose/Duration: One comprehensive psychological evaluation should be performed by an independently licensed psychologist. Ongoing treatment as indicated by the results of the initial evaluation. Content should include: a. Appropriate review of records: The referring p rovider should assist in providing medical record documentation. Other information is sometimes reviewed, as necessary, e.g., from a family assessment, job description, etc. b. Clinical interview with patient: The following parameters should be described from this interaction and other data obtained: History (including mental health, physical health, work, educational, legal, and substance use history), description of the pain, disability and/or other clinical problem, analysis of medication usage, social hist ory, mental status, and behavioral assessment (including, as necessary, ADL, functional issues, and operant parameters, e.g., pain/illness behavior and environmental influences). c. Psychological testing: A battery of appropriate diagnostic psychological tests should be administered and interpreted, as necessary. This should include instruments with evidence of validity and/or appropriate normative NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 62 data for the condition or problems being assessed and have known value in differential diagnosis or treatment pla nning.(886) In selecting test instruments, the clinician should consider: 1) the appropriateness of the test(s) for the patient's presenting complaints and condition; 2) the appropriateness of a test(s) given the degree to which the patient's medical, gender, race/ethnicity, age, educational and other group status was represented during the test(s) development; 3) how a patient's performance in comparison to normative data will be useful in diagnosis or treatment planning; 4) the prognostic value of interp reted test data for certain treatments; and/or 5) whether the sensitivity and specificity will enhance the accuracy of a diagnosis . Indications for psychological tests may include circumstances when: i. understanding factors contributing to the patient's pai n reports and disability behaviors; ii. a mental disorder is suspected; iii. evaluating for a functional restoration program; iv. the evaluation is part of a pre -surgical assessment; v. there is suspicion of cognitive impairment; vi. the veracity of the complaint is at issue . vii. Standardized psychological testing should be done as a part of a comprehensive mental health evaluation, as properly performed psychological testing enhances the reliability and value of a psychological evaluation. Psychological testing is usually perfor med by a psychologist, but psychiatrists or other physicians also perform such assessments if it is within the scope of their training and experience. Standards for the psychological assessment of patients with chronic pain have been reviewed elsewhere . Additionally, both evidence and expert consensus regarding what variables should be assessed in these evaluations has also been reviewed . The test battery for evaluation of patients with chronic nonmalignant pain includes, but is not limited to: a) test(s) for assessment of the presenting pain, and/or other related health complaints or dysfunction; b) test(s) of personality and psychopathology; c) brief cognitive testing, when there is suspicion of CNS impairment; d) diagnostic impressions: These should be inferred according to the ICD -10; e) summary: The psychological evaluation should provide both cogent explanations for the identified complaints and dysfunction, and recommendations for management. N.2 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Patients with CRPS Recommended - for treatment of subacute and chronic CRPS . Indications: Indications for the use of CBT in CRPS conditions include: 1. Inadequate results from traditional physical therapy and exercise program; NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 63 2. clinically significant problems of noncompliance or non -adherence to prescribed medical or physical regimens; 3. Mood disorders that complicate the management of the pain condition 4. vocational counseling for resolution of psychosocial barriers in return to work (requires a current or imminent medical release to return to work); 5. resolution of interpersonal, behavioral, or occupational self -management problems in the workplace, during/aft er return to work, where such problems are risk factors for loss of work or are impeding resumption of full duty or work consistent with permanent restrictions; and 6. Management of clinically significant behavioral aberrations and/or anxiety during opiate we aning or detoxification. 7. Sleep disturbance due to pain (Currie 00) Frequency/Dose/Duration: CBT psychotherapy provided either independently or as a component therapy integrated into a program that includes physical therapy, such as an interdisciplinary or other functional restoration program . Established protocols for CBT require from 16 hours to up to 24 hours to accomplish. For select patients (e.g., ongoing medical procedures, serious complications, medication dependence, injuries associated with ps ychological trauma), longer supervised psychological/psychiatric treatment may be indicated . Adjunctive treatment generally includes medication for another condition (e.g., depression) as indicated. CBT should normally be limited to six sessions or less i nitially. Additional appointments are generally needed, especially for those with multiple complex problems to address. Provision of additional appointments should be contingent on compliance with the requirements from the initial set of appointments. Wh en therapy is provided as a component of an interdisciplinary or functional restoration program, the number of sessions is based on the needs of the program to provide relevant treatment objectives. Evidence for the Use of Cognitive Therapy N.3 Fear Avoidance Belief Training Recommended - for treatment of patients with acute, subacute and chronic CRPS. Indications: All stages and phases of CRPS FABT is particularly indicated at the time a patient is voicing a belief. It is also indicated at any point when there is a FAB that is uncovered in routine discussions. Preemptive training is also indicated in the event the worker does not voice the F AB. FABT is generally combined with, and/or addressed in the course of other treatment. Frequency/Dose/Duration: Intervention is provided at the time a FAB is voiced or uncovered. Should particularly address a de -emphasis on anatomical abnormalities, encouraging active management by the patient and education. When a FAB is identified, subsequent vigilance on the pa rt of the provider may help to reinforce proper beliefs and then would usually consist of two to three appointments and could range up to a total of approximately six appointments. Patients with particularly strong FABs may require up to 12 appointments. Fear Avoidance Belief Training (FABT) NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 64 N.4 Biofeedback Recommended - for select treatment CRPS . Indications: CRPS patients who have been treated and compliant with aerobic and strengthening exercises, NSAID s, etc., with ongoing significant impairment needing multidisciplinary rehabilitation. Biofeedback also is a reasonable as an intervention for patients who also have significant stress -related issues combined with chronic pain. Biofeedback requires motiv ated and compliant patients and is often performed in conjuction with other self -regulation strategies (e.g., relaxation training, mindfulness meditation, self -hypnosis ). Frequency/Dose/Duration: Requires a series of appointments to teach techniques and verify appropriate use, generally starting with five to six appointments. Appointments also needed to reinforce home use. Should generally be used to subsequently enhance functional gains, (e.g., increasing activity or exercise levels ). May require up to 12 appointments. Evidence for the Use of Biofeedback NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 65 Appe ndix 1: Basic Definitions of Terms Often Used in the Context of CRPS Acute Pain: Pain of one month or less duration. Pain lasting >1 month but <3 months is termed \"subacute.\" Central Pain: Pain that is due to a lesion or other abnormality that is located in the central nervous system. Examples of disorders in this category include tumors, strokes, and traumatic brain injury (TBI) sequelae. Central Sensitization and Central Sensitivity Syndromes: Central sensitization is considered a condition of the central nervous system that produces and maintains a chronic pain state. While the exact mechanism(s) is(are) not known, the entity is believed to involve an up-regulation from a normal state of perceptions of pain. Patients may have increased sensitivity to pain, thus experiencing as painful som ething that normal individuals would not generally consider painful (e.g., touch, pressure), also known as allodynia. They also usually experience more pain than usual to a mildly painful stimulus (hyperalgesia). The prototypical diseases for central sensi tization have been generally considered to be post -stroke and spinal cord injury. Other diseases commonly associated with central sensitivity include fibromyalgia, traumatic brain injury, and multiple sclerosis. Chronic or Non -Acute Pain: Pain categorized purely based on duration is defined as chronic when lasting at least 3 months. This may be divided into chronic malignant pain and chronic non-malignant pain, although evidence of meaningful differences between those 2 categories is negligible. Yet, chron ic pain is much more complex. As a patient's condition transitions through the acute, subacute and chronic phases, the central nervous system is reorganized. As pain continues over time, the CNS remodels itself so that pain becomes less closely associated with sensation, and more closely associated with arousal, emotion, memory and beliefs 7,12. Because of these CNS processes, the physician should be aware that as the patient enters the subacute phase, it becomes increasingly important to consider the psychosocial context of the disorder being treated, including the patient's social circumstances, arousal level, emotional state, and beliefs about the disorder. However, behavioral complications and physiological changes associated with chronicity and central sensitization may also be present in the acute phase, and within hours of the initial injury.13 Chronic Non -malignant Pain (CNMP): Pain lasting over 3 months that is not due to neoplasms, cancers, or tumors. It is also referred to as chronic non -canc er pain (CNCP). It is a subcategory of all chronic pain which may be further subdivided into the subcategories of chronic persistent pain and chronic pain syndrome. The former predominantly refers to pain duration with the latter indicating that additional features such as limited functional status, vocational status, and/or significant psychological features are present. See also the \"The New York Non -Acute Pain Medical Treatment Guidelines\" of the New York State Workers' Compensation Board. Chronic Pain Syndrome: Pain over 3 months duration with additional features such as limited functional status, vocational status, and/or significant psychological features are present. NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 66 Delayed Recovery: An increase in the period of time prior to returning to work or usual activities compared with the length of time expected based on reasonable expectations, severity of disorder, age, and treatments provided. Factitious Illness: A mental disorder wherein the patient either falsifies or self -induces symptoms of illness . It is thought to involve both conscious and non -conscious factors. The primary drive is thought to be assuming the role of being a patient or being sick. By definition it is not occupational. Functional Improvement (especially Objective Evidence): Evalu ation of the patient prior to the initiation of treatment should include documentation regarding objective physical findings and current functional abilities both at home and at work. This should include a clear statement regarding what objective or functi onal goals are to be achieved through the use of treatment. These measures should be tracked during treatment and evidence of progress towards meeting these functional goals should be sought. Examples of documentation supporting improved function would be increased physical capabilities including job specific activities, return to work, return from off -duty-status to modified duty, performance of exercise goals, participation in progressive physical therapy, and other activities of daily living. Validated tool(s), such as the Modified Oswestry Questionnaire and Roland -Morris Disability Questionnaire may also help track progress, although they are subjective. Objective improvements in strength or aerobic capacity may be physical examination correlates of improved function. Hyperalgesia: Increased or markedly painful response to a stimulus which is normally painful (e.g., light pinprick leads to extreme and prolonged pain). This is in contrast to allodynia , pain due to a stimulus which does not normally provok e pain (e.g., light touch causes pain). Malignant Pain: Pain associated with cancer, or treatment effects of cancer is commonly termed malignant pain. This pain should be distinguished from non -malignant pain or chronic non-malignant pain. Neuralgia: Pain that is thought to be nerve related and is present in the distribution of a nerve or nerve root. Neuritis: Neuritis technically describes an i nflammation of a nerve(s). In practice it is often inaccurately used to label any pain thought to be nerve -related, regardless of whether or not there is an inflammatory process. Neurogenic Pain: Pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion, dysfunction, or transitory perturbation in the peripheral or central nervous system. Neuropathic Pain: Pain caused by ab normal function of the nervous system due to injury or disease. There is generally no relationship between end -organ damage and pain perception as is thought to be present in nociceptive pain. Although an affected individual perceives pain as emanating fro m some bodily structure (e.g., the distal lower extremity in sciatica), the pathophysiologic basis for the pain is believed to be an abnormality in the functioning of the central or peripheral nervous system, rather than an abnormality in the location wher e the pain is perceived. Neuropathic pain can be due to a lesion in the central nervous system, as is seen in post -stroke pain or thalamic pain, (central neuropathic pain) or due to lesions in the peripheral nervous system. Postherpetic neuralgia, painful neuropathies (e.g., diabetes NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 67 mellitus), and what was previously referred to as causalgia (CRPS II) are all examples of conditions characterized by peripheral neuropathic pain. Neuropathy: A disturbance of function or pathological change in a nerve. This is called a mononeuropathy if involving one nerve. If diffuse and bilateral, it is called a peripheral or polyneuropathy. Nociceptive Pain: Pain that arises through the normal activation of pain pathways. In the acute stage, it serves as a protective mechanism to alerting the individual to the presence of potentially damaging stimuli. Once the inciting stimulus is removed and healing has occurred, nociceptive pain typically resolves. While nociceptive pain can be somatic (carried along the sensory fib ers) or visceral (transmitted through the autonomic nervous system), most injuries lead to somatic pain. Nocebo Effect: The opposite of placebo effect, occurring when the patient believes that exposure to treatment, activity, or event may be harmful and leads to adverse effects or results in less benefit than expected. Pain Behavior: Verbal and non -verbal actions (e.g., grimacing, groaning, limping, using pain relieving or support devices, requesting pain medications, etc.) which communicate the concept of pain to others. Pain Documentation: Pain is most commonly assessed via patient report using numeric or visual analog scales. It cannot yet be measured objectively. Peripheral Pain: Pain that is due to pathology in a location other than in the central nervous system. This includes some examples of neuropathic pain (e.g., pain from an entrapment neuropathy) and all types of nociceptive pain (e.g., pain from muscle -tendon unit abnormalities). Placebo Effect: A placebo effect is a beneficial effect that is not attributable to the \"intervention\" itself. This effect may be based on patient and provider belief(s) and/or expectation(s). Psychological tests. Psychological tests are part of the standard for assessing chronic pain, and are generally indicat ed by a positive psychological screening test or by other indications. They are usually multidimensional. These tests are typically standardized with test results compared to norms. These are interpreted by a psychologist and/or physician with appropriate training. Screening tool. A screening tool is generally succinct, and may be as short as one or two questions. The frequency is usually at least in the initial exam and/or once a year. Subacute Pain: Pain lasting 1 to 3 months. Tender Points: Unusual tenderness on palpation at a tendon insertion or origin, muscle belly or over bone. Some examiners require palpation of a taut muscle band or knot to qualify as a tender point. T he most widely used criteria are palpation of the area(s) involved with the thumb or forefinger, applying pressure (palpation) approximately equal to a force of 4 kilograms (blanching of the entire nail bed) with a requirement for the patient to acknowledg e that the palpation is not merely a discomfort, but would be described as pain. NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 68 Trigger Points: Frequently used as a synonym for tender points, but is technically reserved for a subset of tender points in which there is elicitation of distal symptoms, u sually accompanied with local symptoms, on palpation of the tender point. Trigger points are traditionally associated with myofascial pain . Visual Analog Scale (VAS) : Measures a patient's reported level of pain, ranging from \"no pain\" to \"worst pain\" by indicating a mark on a line, frequently 10 cm long. The distance from the low end of the line to the patient's \"x\" is the pain score. NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 69 Appendix 2: Areas of Inquiry for Initial CRPS History Medical History Questionnaire Asking the patient open -ended questions such as those below allows the provider to gauge the need for further discussion or specific inquiries to obtain more detailed information (see Appendix 3 for additional questions). 1.

The Stanford Five (created by Dr. Sean Mackey of Stanford University) is an augmented set of medical history obtained by the clinician during the medical interview for patients with pain. The Stanford Five is desi gned to assess and present the pain experience as viewed from the patient's primary belief system. The following are the components of the Stanford Five: Cause : What tissue abnormalities the patient believes to be the cause of the current problem Meaning : The presence of any sinister beliefs related to the pain, in terms of tissue damages, that precludes activities Impact : What impact the primary problem has on the patient's life, including interference on vocational, social, recreational activities, and in general the patient's quality of life Goals : What the patient expects to achieve with further treatment Treatment : What the patient believes needs to be done now and in the future to help resolve the problem NYS WCB MTG - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome 73 Appendix 3: Components of Interval Pain History to be Considered by Provider What do you hope to accomplish during this visit?
