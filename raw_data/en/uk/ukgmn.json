Topics include the basic philosophy and foundations of traditional Eastern medicine such as the concepts of balance between the human body and the natural environm ent, fundamental textures and vital substances, organs of the body, meridians, causes and diagnoses of disease (origins of disharmony/pathogenic factors), and specific Eastern and alternative medical therapies such as acupuncture, moxibustion, herbal medic ine, cupping and movement practices. We will examine differences between Eastern and Western health belief systems and practices, including issues related to culturally effective medical approaches, communication, and patient satisfaction and adherence to medical treatment plans. Evidence -based concepts will be utilized along with literature search and interpretation. Learning Objectives and Outcomes Upon course completion, the student will: be prepared to approach professional interactions with patients who incorporate traditional Eastern and alternative medical values into their personal health care with a strong foundation in the theories and practices upon which Eastern and al ternative medicine is based ; have an understanding of Eastern and alternative /integrative perspectives about the causes and symptoms of diseases and their diagnosis and treatment; be able to approach patient -practitioner interactions with culturally - based knowledge about the ways in which patients with Eastern and alternative /integrative medical beliefs maintain health, interpret disease episodes, seek health care, and integrate traditional Eastern and alternative /integrative medical practices with Western biomedicine. Prerequisite(s): N/A Co-Requisite(s): N/A Concurrent Enrollment: N/A Recommended Preparation : Fundamentals of Medicine Course Notes This is a upper -level course that involves academic library -based research, writing skills or documented steps taken to improve your current writing, the development and enhancement of your public speaking skills, and collaborative group discussions and activi ties. This is not a class about particular formulae of Eastern and alternative herbal products and remedies. H ealth beliefs about the use of Eastern and alternative /integrative therapies is focused to enhance student's skills as a future professional in a biomedical field . Technological Proficiency and Hardware/Software Required Course notes may be accessed via Blackboard . The course is delivered via Zoom an d in-person this semester. Required Readings and Supplementary Materials Required Course Text: Kaptchuk TJ. The Web That Has No Weaver: Understanding Chinese Medicine. 2000. New York: McGraw- Hill. Supplemental readings and research articles as assigned. Research journal articles are available to you as a registered USC student electronically through the extensive USC library system. Description and Assessment of Assignments 1. Quizzes : [60 points]: There will be three quizzes in the Wednesday lectures, to ensure understanding of the material. 2. Midterm Exam: [60 p oints]. There will be one midterm in written format . Syllabus for HP450, Page 3 3. Eastern and Alternative Medicine in the News : [10 points]. Students are expected to share with the class an item of interest in the news and popular media related to Eastern and alternative medicin e. The article must relate to an aspect of health beliefs about a non -biomedical practice, remedy, or behavior. It may NOT be a biomedical article describing a biophysiological or pharmaceutical discovery (0 points), nor may it be a simple description of a n Eastern or alternative practice (0 points). Take the time to read the article in advance and to highlight the main points. Clip or print out the item and bring it to class to share with the rest of us (and turn in to me for your points). A sign- up list w ill be made available early in the semester, with spaces for two or three people to sign up for each of the dates listed. Students will be expected to stand and address the class, and to orally summarize the article \u2014do not just read it aloud. If any student happen s to bring the same item as does another person [on the same day or on another day], the second speaker to summarize the same media item will be expected to address a slightly differen t angle of the same article. In such case, both students will receive the points. 4. Poster Presentation Project, Part 1: Explanatory Model of Health Beliefs About A Selected Health Condition : [50 points]: This, with the Poster Presentation of your research data, is the largest and most important semester -long assignm ent you will have in HP450. We will be exploring the concept of health beliefs within the framework of Explanatory Models: \"An explanatory model reveals how people make sense of their illness and provides a framework whereby ... healthcare providers engage with participants/patients in comprehensively understanding their lived illness experience. This model was proposed by Arthur Kleinman to organize illness and health within socio - cultural contexts. Such a model investigates explanations of sickness and social realities that are culturally shaped and influence how individuals experience disease. Explanatory models are often used to explain how people view their illness in terms of how it happens, what causes it, how it affects them, and what will make them feel better.\" Kleinman A. Concepts and a model for the comparison of medical systems as cultural systems. Social Science & Medicine. 1978: 12:85- 93. You will research, prepare, and share with the class information you have gathered on one or more health beliefs about a selected health condition among a selected cultural group, structured within the Modified 5 - step Explanatory Model framework (see below). You may investigate your own family/cultural background, or choose to research another cultural group. The project involves five consecutive steps, each building on the step preceding it, culminating in the creative design of a professional conference -style research poster and the presentation of your research to the class. *For this assignment, you are not attempting to assess whether or not a particular Eastern or alternative remedy or practice \"works\". Efficacy as assessed from a biomedical perspective is not our focus. We are looking at HEALTH BELIEFS people have about that remedy or practice, and applying that knowledge to the enhancement of patient -practitioner interactions in a biomedical setting. *Please DO NOT ingest or otherwise consume any herbal products or participate in uncomfortable Eastern or alternative medical therapi es as part of your research for this class project. The Research Poster Presentation process is divided up into five separately evaluated steps, each building on the step that preceded it, due at progressive intervals during the semester: Syllabus for HP450, Page 4 The Four Steps for Choosing and Researching Your Research Project: Step 1 : Brainstorm : You will participate during class in brainstorming possible topics [5 pts (tentatively scheduled for 1/31/2022 )] Step 2 : Identify Your Selected Health Condition and Cultural Group: You will identify your selected health condition and cultural group for your research project [5 points (due 2/14/2022)] TEMPLATE : I plan to research health beliefs about the following health condition: _______________________ among (some or many) people in my family/my cultural group/another cultural group. The cultural group I am going to investigate is: ______________________________. Select the health condition you wish to investigate from among the following options: Cancer (choose among many) Heart disease / / Malaria HIV/AIDS Diabetes Tuberculosis / / Hepatitis C Fertility/prenatal/childbirth Cerebrovascular disease (stroke) Respiratory infections (incl. common cold) / / Influenza/pneumonia Depression/anxiety Dermatologic conditions Parasitic infections Step 3 : Two Paragraph Topic Description: The Health Condition, the Cultural Group, with Two Academic References (15 points; due 2/28/2022 ). You will turn in a typed and double -spaced, brief but coherent, grammatically flawless, college - level, descriptive essay in two paragraphs: o Paragraph #1: single paragraph about the health condition you have chosen to investigate. Include a basic current description of the health condition; describe morbidity and mortality; include current U.S. statistics with references. Use your own words; do not paste in data from the Internet. o Paragraph #2. Single paragraph describing the cultural group you have chosen to investigate. Include an overview of the culture, your connection with the culture (if any), and basic U.S. demographic details with references. Use your own words; do not paste in data from the Internet. o At this point, if you have identified specific health beliefs about your health condition and cultural group, good! Bullet -list them here. Use your own words; do not paste in data from the Internet. List TWO academic reference citations accurately formatted according to the American Medical Association (AMA) style guide (see example below).*USE ONLY THE AMA TEMPLATE I HAVE PRESENTED BELOW. Do not use the USC library templa te or an automatically formatted template. (I have found some of these to be inaccurate.) I deduct points for inaccurately cited references. o The two academic journal articles are expected to address health beliefs about your selected health condition and, ideally, the cultural group you are investigating. The articles you choose may not present a purely bio -physiological study of a particular biochemical substance or health condition, nor may it be a simple description of an Eastern or alternative remedy (0 points). o Attach photocopies of the first two pages of each article. Make sure that the abstract for each article is included on the first two pages; if not, photocopy the abstract separately and turn it in. (Note: you do not summarize the a rticles at this point) Syllabus for HP450, Page 5 o Each of the two articles must have been published in a professional academic medical, nursing, anthropological, or public health journal within the last 1 0+ years (between 2010 and 2020). o Websites and magazine articles may NOT substi tute for these academic journal articles (though you may use them as supplementary materials). Suggestion: To be sure that an article is a published academic article, make sure it is abstracted online on PubMed (pubmed.gov). AMA CITATION FORMAT: Note the use of italicized script for the journal titles, and the fact that only the first word, acronyms, and proper nouns are capitalized in the journal titles. Many students in past semesters have disregarded these formatting requirements, simple as they seem to be. Please pay attention so you do not lose critical points on your important assignments. For a journal article with one to four authors: Baum M. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and cancer: the ugly face of alternative medicine. Int J Surg. 2009;7(5):409 -412. For a journal article with six or more authors (list the first three authors and add \"et al.\": Astin JA, Marie A, Pelletier KR, et al. A review of the incorporation of complementary and alternative medicine by mainstream physic ians. Arch Intern Med. 1998;158(21): 2303- 2310. *Note: It will be challenging to find these academic articles; please plan on devoting an appropriate amount of your time early in the semester to this aspect of the assignment. You will access the full -text articles through the USC library system, available to you for free as USC student. Do not pay for any academic research articles. Depending on the topic you choose, these articles may not always be easy to find. If you realize that you cannot find enough appropriate articles on your topic, it's time to choose a different topic immediately. See me as soon as possible. HOW TO START : A good way to start your search is on pubmed.gov, which abstracts biomedical research articles. Search on \"health beliefs\", an d see what you can find out about your selected health condition and your selected cultural group. You might also search on \"patient explanatory models\". Once you have found a list of potential articles, go online to the USC library website to access the f ull text articles. Remember you will need to print out the first two pages, including the abstract, of each of the full text articles you use for your project. Real Examples of Academic Journal Articles I Recently Found on pubmed.gov: Adams CE, Leverland MB. The effects of religious beliefs on the health care practices of the Amish. Nurse Pract . 1986;11(3) 63- 67. Yosef AR. Health beliefs, practice, and priorities for health care of Arab Muslims in the United States. J Transcult Nurs. 2008;19(3):284 -91. Giger JN, Davidhizar RE, Turner G. Black American folk medicine health care beliefs: implication for nursing plans of care. ABNF J. 1992;3(2):42 -46. Step 4 : Explanatory Model: Bulleted Components and Academic Journal Articles' Main Points (25 points; due 4/04/2022): You will turn in a typed, college -level, coherent, grammatically flawless Explanatory Model (using the 5- step model, shown below) about the heal th belief(s) you have discovered while investigating your selected health condition within the cultural group you have chosen to research. Syllabus for HP450, Page 6 A. Bullet -list the 4 to 7 main points from Paragraph #1 (which you already wrote; see above) about the health condit ion you have chosen to investigate. Include bulleted information about the description of the health condition; morbidity and mortality; current U.S. statistics with references. Use your own words; do not paste in data from the Internet. B. Bullet -list th e 4 to 7 main points from Paragraph #2 (which you already wrote; see above) about the cultural group you have chosen to investigate. Include bulleted details about the overview of the culture, your connection with the culture (if any), and basic U.S. demog raphic details with references. C. Bullet -list the 10 to 12 main points from each of your two academic research articles. Eloquently, objectively, accurately, and in your own words, summarize in ten to twelve bullet points the main points of each of your two academic journal articles. Summarize the two articles separately. That means you will bullet -list 10 to 12 main points from EACH article, directly below each article title cited in accurate AMA format. EXAMPLE: Adams CE, Leverland MB. The effects of r eligious beliefs on the health care practices of the Amish. Nurse Pract. 1986;11(3):63 -67. Main Point #1: Main Point #2: Etc. for 10 to 12 main points *Do not use the articles' abstracts for this section: you must use your own words. You will have already turned in the abstracts when you turned in the first two pages of your two research articles. Use your own insightful words. D. Present the Data You've Discovered About Health Beliefs, using Kleinman's modified 5 -Step Explanatory Model: Compose a well -written, grammatically flawless, bulleted list of responses to the components: 1. What do people believe causes the health condition? 2. What do people believe the health condition does to them physically, emotionally, and/or spiritually? 3. What are the most important problems that people believe they face because of the health condition? In other words, how do they believe it impacts their lives? 4. What aspect of this health condition are people most afraid of? 5. What kind of treatment do people believe they sho uld receive for this condition? Include the following: To whom do they seek treatment for this health condition? What results do they expect to get from treatment for this health condition? E. Conclusions: Your Informed Perspective. Eloquently, objectively, and accurately bullet -list a 10- point summary of your informed perspective about what people in the cultural group you researched believe about the health condition you investigated. Explain how knowledge about particular health be liefs can be applied to working with patients in biomedical settings. Remember to avoid trying to determine whether or not a remedy or practice \"works\". 5. Poster Presentation Project, Part 2 : The Poster Presentation. You will design a creative, visually informative, professional -level research poster that uses the bulleted information to present the perspectives you have gained about the health condition, the cultural group, and the Explanatory Model about health beliefs that you have developed. You will present your poster on the date scheduled to Syllabus for HP450, Page 7 multiple small groups of fellow - classmates and to me in a simulated professional conference poster session. [100 pts (scheduled for November according to the sign -up schedule)] *What Not To Do for the Poster P resentation Project : Here is what I do not want to see in work turned in for this assignment, and for which I will deduct varying numbers of points: 1. Do not present biomedical criticism or dismissal of the Eastern or alternative practice \u2014because most biomedical articles are critical or dismissive of Eastern and alternative medical practices. This is not what we are looking for. We are researching health beliefs that help explain the human, cultural perspective of why people use particular Eastern or alterna tive therapies. I will deduct points for any articles turned in for this component of the project that do not address health beliefs about the remedy or practice you are researching. 2. Do not present a description of your own opinion about whether or not the remedy or practice \"works\". This is not what we are looking for. The focus is on why people use that remedy or practice and how knowledge about those reasons can enhance biomedical practice. I will deduct points for narrative components that simply try t o assess whether or not a particular remedy or practice \"works\". 3. Do not present a messy, poorly designed, unimaginative research poster without effective visual embellishments that illustrate the topic; a poster that has the appearance of being thrown together at the last minute; substandard public speaking skills; poor time management in your research poster presentation; writing levels that are less than 400 -level college work. 6. Final Exam : [80 points] The University requires that all instructors adhe re to the final examination schedule. The final exam is mandatory for all students. The final exam focuses on the second half of the semester, but may contain course content referring to the subject of Eastern and alternative medicine on a more semester -wide level. The final exam will be in written format. 7. Final Reflective Essay : [40 points] You will compose and turn in by the day of the final exam a thoughtful, well -written, grammatically flawless, typed, one- to-two page Final Reflective Essay describ ing what you have taken away from your experience in HP450. I am most interested in knowing how you might plan to apply your learning experience in HP450 to your future career and professional goals. NOTE: I am NOT looking for praise/criticism for the clas s or for myself, but for a thoughtful assessment of what you feel you have learned about Eastern and Alternative Medicine and how you might be able to apply it to your own future plans. 8. Course Participation : [approximately 50 points] This is not a lecture -only class. You will be expected to participate in group discussions , presentations and activities, and a ttend class consistently and on time with respect shown to others .
