Sixty eight percent have a Body Mass Index equal to or greater than 25, which is categorizes them as overweight or obese. The causes are many, including inadequate education about healthy diets, time constraints in busy lifestyles, and the prevalence of nutritionally-empty, sugar and/or fat laden fast foods. The results are well known: physiological and emotional factors, metabolic typing and dysfunction, nutritional deficiency, and greater risk of several, more significant health conditions. Physiological Issues It is widely believed that we get heavier as we age; however, the reality is that we get fatter as we age and not necessarily heavier. Although weight is often used to describe one's health, the percent of body fat we carry is not a much more meaningful indicator of fitness, health and physical attractiveness than weight. Aging is associated with a pattern of obesity in which the percent body fat increases, and a higher proportion of our body fat is deposited in the trunk and abdomen.The \"non-fat\" or \"low-fat\" tend makes for compelling marketing strategy. However, many low fat foods are high in simple carbohydrates, which have more to do with obesity and are a greater health concern than most fats is the opinion of some scientists. Most experts currently agree that oxidized and cooked fats are the problem, by contrast, some dietary fats are necessary for hormone synthesis and are also very efficient source of energy. Many neurological, female, inflammatory and /or cardiovascular health issues could be helped by the intake of adequate dietary fatty acids such as EPA/DHA formulas.Proper dietary fat is necessary for shedding body fat and improving body composition. In fact, low fat diets can actually stimulate excess fat storage. In such cases, the cellular energy production process can become faulty which causes a blockage of fat stores not being utilized while sugar or glycogen stores are quickly burned up. Consequently, the body craves carbohydrates to raise energy and replenish the stored sugars. When we ingest simple carbohydrates, the body uses those carbohydrates instead of fat and converts the leftovers to fat. The body is very efficient at converting sugar to fat but not doing the opposite. Consequently, when simple carbohydrates are used as primary fuel source, results are hormone imbalances, slow energy, poor sleep, mood swings and cravings. Consistent lack of vital nutrients, increased body fat mass and increased fat cells all can alter the body's functions and increase susceptibility to many health consequences linked with long term obesity. These consequences can include osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease to name a few. Additionally, stagnant fat stores can have a negative impact on our health in terms of toxin and hormone storage overload. Homeopathy Weight Management Program The Homeopathy Weight Management Program provides homeopathic support for weight loss by inhibiting appetite, cravings, improving metabolism. This program is designed to target the abnormal brown fat stores that are difficult to reduce with general dieting and exercise. Phases: Phase 1: This is the cleansing phase. You will begin the intake of the Homeopathy Weight Management Formula, sublingual (under the tongue) in drops. Phase 1 actually refers to the first two days of the diet where you are instructed to load up on fat. The Homeopathy Weight Management Program uses fat as its energy source, so load up on fat these first two days and it will help you from getting too hungry on the first few days of the actual diet. Phase 2: This phase will usually last for 20 to 40 days. The number of days you are in this phases depends on how much weight you want to lose. If you just want to lose 5 to 15 pounds then 20 days will be plenty. If you want to lose more than 15 pounds then plan on doing the diet for 40 days. During this phase you will be on a very low calorie diet, only consuming 500 calories a day, but your body will be able to take the rest of the calories needed in fat stores from your body with the Homeopathy Weight Management Formula. You may be surprised but you really are not hungry and have good energy during this phase. Phase 3: The maintenance phase. This phase lasts for 3 weeks before you start again at Phase 1. It is basically a continuation of phase 2, but you can eat more calories and have more food options. You still have to avoid all starches and sugars! This phase is designed to stabilize your weight. You add one week to Phase 3 every time that you do it. Phase 4: Live your life. You can start eating whatever you want again, although it is important to be smart and not go overboard on your eating. Most people keep the weight off; possibly do to a reset metabolism and lifestyle changes that occur as a result of the diet. If you find yourself gaining any of your weight back, go back to phase 3 until you lose that extra weight. These are the four phases of the Homeopathy Weight Management Program. Its design is pretty simple, but you must follow the rules of the diet precisely to see results and to keep the weight off. If you commit to it 100% and do not cheat, then you will lose that extra weight that you have been wanting to shed.
