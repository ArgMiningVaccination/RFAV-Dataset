Oregon Medicaid PA Criteria 9 July 1, 2020 General PA informatio n Overview For drugs that require PA on Point o f Sale (POS) cl aims: A new evaluation feature of the Oregon Medicaid POS sy stem, DUR Plus, reviews incoming POS claims and issues PA when the drug meets app ropriate clinical criteria. For drugs that do not pass DUR Plus review, pharmacies must contact the prescribing provi der, who then requests PA fr om the Oregon Pharmacy Call Ce nter. Drugs requiring PA - See OAR 410 -121-0040 for more infor mation The Divisio n may require PA for individual drugs and categor ies of drugs to ensure that the drugs prescribed ar e indicated for c onditions funded by OHP and consistent with the Prioritize d List of Health Services and its corresponding treatment guide lines (see OAR 410 -141-0480 and 410-141-0520). DUR Plus review The Oregon Medicaid POS system initially evaluates inco ming pharmacy cla ims for basic edits and audi ts. If the drug on the claim r equires PA and requires DUR Plus evaluation, the claim passes t hrough a series of clinical criteria rules to determine whether DUR Plus can issue PA and allow dispensing the drug to the client. DUR Plus checks the current dr ug claim as well as the client 's medical and claims history for the appropriate criteria. If suitable criteria are found, a prior authorization will be systematically created, applied to the claim, and the claim will be paid. This interactive process occur s with no processing delays an d no administrative work for the pharmacy or prescribing p rovid er. If all criteri a are not met, the claim will be denied and PA will be required. The prescriber will be responsible for requesting PA, using procedures outlined in OAR 410 -121-0060.

Notes on adverse effects of treatment: C1 esterase inhibitors - In clinical trials of patients with moderate to severe hereditary angioedema attacks, use o f C1 esterase inhibitors improved the duration of symptoms by an average 1 -2 hours compared to placebo. Prophylactic use has only been evaluated in patients with more than 2 attacks per m onth. - Hypersensitivity reactions have been observed with C1 esteras e inhibitors. Due to the risk of anaphylaxis, it is recommended that all patients prescribed human derived C1 esterase inhibitors have epinephrine immediately available. - Serious arterial and venous thrombotic events have been reported with use of C1 es terase inhibitors, particularly in patients with pre -existing risk factors for thromboembolism. The exact incidence of thrombosis with C1 esterase inhibitors is unclear. In patients using pro phylactic therapy with Cinryze\u00ae, over an average of 2.6 years, 3% of patients experienced thrombosis. Ecallantide - The average improvement in symptoms compared to placebo at 4 hours after treatment of an acute attack was 0.4 points on a 0 -3 point scale. - Ecallantide has a box warning for anaphylaxis. In clinical tria ls, 3-4% of patients treated with ecallantide experienced anaphylaxis. Risks of treatment should be weighed against the benefits. Icatibant - In clinical trials of icatibant for acute attacks, tim e to 50% overall symptom improvement was 17.8 hours better than placebo (19 vs. 2 hours). A second study demonstrated no difference from placebo in time to symptom improvement. There are no data available on quality of life, daily activities, physical or m ental functioning with use of icatibant. Lanadelumab -flyo - Prophylactic use has only been evaluated in patients with more than 1 moderate -severe attack per month. Hypersensitivity reactions were observed in 1% of patients treated with C1 esterase inhibitors. Elevated liver enzymes were also observed more freque ntly with lanadelumab compared to placebo (2% vs. 0%), and the long -term safety is unknown.

Fingolimod Clinical Notes: Because of bradycardia and atrioventricular conduction, patients must be observed for 6 hours after initial dose in a clinically appropriate area. Patients on antiarrhythmics, beta -blockers or calcium channel blockers or with risk factors for bradycardia (h/o MI, age >70 yrs., electrolyte disorder, hypothyroidism) may be more prone to development of symp tomatic bradycardia and should be initiated on fingolimod with caution. A cardiolo gy evaluation should be performed before considering treatment. Injectable disease modifying treatments remain first -line agents in MS therapy. An ophthalmology evaluation should be repeated 3 -4 months after fingolimod initiation with subsequent evaluations based on clinical symptoms. Oregon Medicaid PA Criteria 198 July 1, 2020 Teriflunomide Clinical Notes: Before starting teriflunomide, screen patients for latent tuberculosis infection with a TB skin tes t, exclude pregnancy, confirm use of reliable contraception in women of childbearing potential, check blood pressure, and obtain a complete blood cell co unt within the 6 months prior to starting therapy. Instruct patients to report symptoms of infection an d obtain serum transaminase and bilirubin levels within the 6 months prior to starting therapy. After starting teriflunomide, monitor ALT levels at lea st monthly for 6 months. Consider additional ALT monitoring when teriflunomide is given with other potent ially hepatotoxic drugs. Consider stopping teriflunomide if serum transaminase levels increase (>3 -times the of normal). Monitor serum tran saminase and bilirubin particularly in patients who develop symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction. D iscontinue teriflunomide and start accelerated elimination in those with suspected teriflunomide -induced liver injury and monitor liver tests weekly until normalized. Check blood pressure periodically and manage hypertension. Check serum potassium level in teriflunomide -treated patients with hyperkalemia symptoms or acute renal failure. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Monitor for hematolo gic toxicity when switching from teriflunomide to another agent with a known potential for hematologic supp ression because systemic exposure to both agents will overlap. Dimethyl Fumarate Clinical Notes: Dimethyl fumarate may decrease a patient's white blood cell count. In the clinical trials the mean lymphocyte counts decreased by approximately 30% during th e first year of treatment with dimethyl fumarate and then remained stable. The incidence of infections (60% vs. 58%) and serious infections (2% vs. 2%) was similar in patients treated with dimethyl fumarate or placebo, respectively. There was no increased incidence of serious infections observed in patients with lymphocyte counts <0.8 x103 cells/mm3 (equivalent to <0.8 cells/\u00b5L). A transient increas e in mean eosinophil counts was seen during the first 2 months of therapy. Dimethyl fumarate should be held if the WBC falls below 2 x103 cells/mm3 or the lymphocyte count is below 0.5 x103 cells/mm3 (cells/\u00b5L) and permanently discontinued if the WBC did not increase to over 2 x103 cells/mm3 or lymphocyte count increased to over 0.5 x103 cells/mm3 after 4 weeks of withholding therapy.

Oregon Medicaid PA Criteria 231 July 1, 2020 Clinical Notes: How to Discontinue Opioids. Adapted from the following guidelin es on opioid prescribing: The Washington State Interagency Guide line on Pres cribing Opioids for Pain; Agency Medical Directors' Group, June 2015. Available at http://www.agencymeddirectors.wa.gov/Files/2015AMDGOpioidGuideline.pdf . Selecting th e optimal timing and approach to tapering depends on multiple factors. The decision to taper should be based on shared decision making between the patient and provider based on risks and benefits of therapy. Involving the patient in the decisio n to taper h elps establish trust with the patient, ensures patient -focused tapering, incorporates the pa tient's values into the taper plan, provides education on the risks of opioid use, and establishes realistic goals and expectations. Avoid insisting on opioid taper ing or discontinuation when opioid use may be warranted. The rate of opioid taper should be based primarily on safety considerations, and special attention is needed for patients on high dose opioids or with significant long -term use, as too ra pid a taper may precipitate withdrawal symptoms or drug -seeking behavior. In addition, behavioral issues or physical withdrawal symptoms can be a major obstacle during an opioid taper. Patients who feel overwhelmed or desperate may try to convince the prov ider to aban don the taper. Although there are no methods for preventing behavioral issues during taper, strategies implemented at the beginning of chronic opioid therapy such as setting clear expectations, allowing for pauses during the taper, and developm ent of an ex it strategy are most likely to prevent later behavioral problems if a taper becomes necessar y. 1. Consider sequential tapers for patients who are on chronic benzodiazepines and opioids. Coordinate care with other prescribers (e.g. psychiatrist ) as necessa ry. In general, taper off opioids first, then the benzodiazepines. 2. Do not use ultra -rapid detoxification or antagonist -induced withdrawal under heavy mida zolam) . 3. Establish an individualized rate of taper based on safety considerations and patient hi story. Common tapers have a dose reduction of 5% to 20% per month: a. Assess for substance use disorder and transition to appropriate medication assiste d treatment if there is diversion or non -medical use, b. Rapid taper (over a 2 to 3 week period) if the patient has had a severe adverse outcome such as overdose or substance use disorder, or c. Slow taper for patients with no acute safety concerns. May co nsider start ing wi th a taper of 10% of the original dose per month and assess the patient's functional and pain status at each visit. 4. Adjust the rate, intensity, and duration of the taper according to the patient's response (e.g. emergence of opioid withdrawal sym ptoms (see Table below)). 5. Watch for signs of unmasked mental health disorders (e.g. depression, PTSD, panic disorder) during taper, especially in patients on prolonged or high dose opioids. Consult with specialists to facilitate a safe and e ffective tap er. Us e validated tools to assess conditions. 6. Consider the following factors when making a decision to continue, pause or discontinue the taper plan: a. Assess the patient behaviors that may be suggestive of a substance use disorder b. Addre ss increased pain with use of non -opioid pharmacological and non -pharmacological options. c. Evaluate patient for mental health disorders. d. If the dose was tapered due to safety risk, once the dose has been lowered to an acceptable level of risk with no addiction b ehavio r(s) present, consider maintaining at the established lower dose if there is a clinically meaningful improvement in function, reduced pain and no serious adverse outcomes. 7. Do not reverse the taper; it must be unidirectional. The rate m ay be slowed or pa used while monito ring for and managing withdrawal symptoms. 8. Increase the taper rate when opioid doses reach a low level (e.g. <15 mg/day MED), since formulations of opioids may not be available to allow smaller decreases. 9. Use non -benzodiazepin e adju nctive agents to treat opioid abstinence syndrome (withdrawal) if needed. Unlike benzodiazepine withdrawal, opioid withdrawal symptoms are rarely medically serious, although they may be extremely unpleasant. Symptoms of mild opioid withdr awal may per sist f or 6 months after opioi ds have been discontinued (see Table below). 10. Refer to a crisis intervention system if a patient expresses serious suicidal ideation with plan or intent, or transfer to an emergency room where the patient can be closely moni tored. 11. Do not start or resume opi oids or benzodiazepines once they have been discontinued, as they may trigger drug cravings and a return to use. Counsel the patient on the increased risk of overdose with abrupt return to a previously presc ribed higher dose. Provide opioid overdose educat ion and consider offering naloxone. 12. Consider inpatient withdrawal management if the taper is poorly tolerated. Oregon Medicaid PA Criteria 232 July 1, 2020 Symptoms and Treatment of Opioid Withdrawal.
