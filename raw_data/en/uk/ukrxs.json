This has been done through consultations with qualified homeopaths. Homeopathic remedies can assist people who want to work on their emotional, mental, spiritual growth, and development. The remedies can help people who strive to achieve a more positive mindset and a feeling of wellbeing. Negative moods, thoughts, and actions can bring about imbalances which can manifest into physical complaints. Do you wonder why negative emotional characteristics exist? We inherit certain personality traits just as we inherit certain physical features through our lineage. When situations arise which trigger negative patterns, the way we react to these life's experiences leads to the development of emotional patterns of behaviour. Homeopathic remedies can help support people who want to work on their challenges on all levels. The remedies can help people who strive to achieve a more positive mindset and a feeling of well being. Negative moods, thoughts, and actions can bring about imbalances. Personality traits, such as impatience, fear, depression, bitterness, lack of self-confidence, or motivation affect a person's vitality and can adversely affect health. Homeopathic remedies do not profoundly change the personality of the individual rather homeopathic remedies help to restore balance within the personality. For example, a chronic worrier can become an occasional worrier, a highly critical and judgmental person can become more tolerant, and a person with a poor self-image can gain more self-confidence. The following are some personality imbalances and homeopathic remedies that address them. Arrogance: Low self-esteem is usually behind the haughtiness and arrogance of an individual. The person overcompensates for feeling unworthy. Platina metallicum is a prominent remedy used for this state of mind. Hyperactive children who argue constantly, insist they are always right, are impatient and have contempt for others, soften and lose their edge with Platina. Fastidiousness: There are certain degrees of perfectionism. Arsenicum album, Ignatia, Nux vomica, and Thuja are some of the homeopathic remedies used to re-balance an overly meticulous personality. Repetitive Thoughts: When people feel threatened, they can have thoughts that they don't desire to enter their minds. These thoughts go on and on, like a broken record, disturbing their concentration and peace of mind. This phenomenon varies in intensity and duration. Lachesis is one remedy that can help people come to terms with the issues at hand. It also helps to dissipate any anger, irritability or frustration that goes along with the thoughts. Women who suffer from premenstrual syndrome often find that this behavioral pattern becomes more prominent during certain times of the month. Lachesis is often used for women who suffer from premenstrual syndrome or who are menopausal. Grief and Depression: The loss of a loved one can leave a deep feeling of sadness that can be felt again and again when certain memories or thoughts about that person are triggered. Homeopathic remedies can help the grieving come to terms with the loss and can lessen the impact of the shock. Ignatia is used for recent bereavement. The person feels nervous and can't stop shaking. The bereaved have usually identified completely with the lost one and feels that she can't possibly exist alone. Natrum muriaticum is commonly used for depression and is especially helpful when the death of a loved one has occurred in the past. The person has never been the same since and has developed a melancholy nature, withdrawing, and not living life to its fullest. For the person who suffers from depression most of his life, is highly responsible, and tends to be a workaholic, Aurum metallicum is used. The Aurum metallicum type of personality blames himself when things go wrong in life. The person feels as if a dark cloud is overhead, eliminating all joy and light. Suicidal thoughts and even attempts are characteristic of this deep type of depression. Physical symptoms often involve heart problems such as high blood pressure or palpitations. Lack of Self-Confidence: Staphysagria is for the person whose poor self-image derives from a past hurt that is followed by suppressed anger. The person feels a need to please everyone and has a fear of how they appear to others. There can also be a deep fear of abandonment and rejection. Staphysagria is a well-indicated remedy for those who have been sexually abused in the past or have been abandoned emotionally by their parents. Thuja is for the reserved, secretive person whose low self-esteem is rooted in feelings of shame and guilt. These people try not to let anyone get to really know them because they fear they will not be accepted. Given the extent of their secrecy, they can have different degrees of paranoia. Panic: Life-threatening events, traffic accidents, and even nightmares can be shocking to the individual involved. The after-effects of such events can produce feelings of panic, fear, anxiety, and restlessness. For example, a person involved in a serious car accident may never feel secure driving again. The individual may insist on becoming a passenger only. As a passenger, she may find herself pressing her foot down on the floor onto an imaginary brake every time she feels uneasy with the driving. The problem with shocking experiences is the uncontrollable and unsubstantiated fear that may follow. Aconite is a prominent remedy used to treat shock. It can be given after the disturbing incident or years later when the panicky behavior can be traced back to the original event. A qualified and experienced homeopath can best decide on the correct remedy and potency needed.
