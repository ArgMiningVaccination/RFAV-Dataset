Blood circulation is increased in reaction to the cold, which increases the body's immune system \u2014 a natural way of fighting off the flu or cold and other conditions (see list below). This treatment acts to reflexively increase the circulation and decrease congestion in the upper respiratory passages, head and throat. It also has a sedating action, and many patients report that they sleep much better during the treatment. The treatment is also effective for pain relief and increases the healing response during acute (\"new\") infections. The wet sock treatment can be used in conjunction with other modalities to treat inflammation, infection or soreness of the throat, headaches, migraines, nasal congestion, upper respiratory infections, coughs, bronchitis and sinus infections. It's important to accompany the treatment with proper nutrition, hydration (drink half your body weight in ounces of purified water daily), and any immune-boosting herbs and supplements your doctor may prescribe for you. Consult your doctor to develop an immune-boosting regime that's specifically designed for you and your needs. It's best to start the wet sock treatment on the first day of an illness, ideally repeating it for three nights in a row. People with chronic conditions (long-term; usually greater than six months) or a compromised immune system should consult with their doctor before starting the wet sock treatment. Wet Sock Treatment Supplies: 1 pair of very thin all-cotton socks (ideally 100% cotton, no less than 60% cotton) 1 pair of thick wool socks (ideally 100% wool, no less than 60% wool) 2 sets of sweats or warm pajamas 1 bowl of ice water other needs: hot foot or full-body bath (for 5-10 minutes), dry towel, and possibly hot ginger or yarrow tea [Natural Treatment](http://www.drkrystaltellier.com/) Directions: 1. Take a hot bath for 5-10 minutes (full body or foot bath). This is very important for the effectiveness of the treatment. In fact, it could be harmful if your feet are not warmed first. 2. Soak the pair of thin cotton socks in the bowl of ice water. Wring the socks out thoroughly so they do not drip. 3. Dry off feet and body thoroughly with a dry towel. 4. Place ice-cold wet cotton socks on your feet and cover with thick wool socks. Put on the first set of pajamas. Go directly to bed. Place the second set of pajamas next to the bed. Avoid getting chilled (drinking hot ginger or yarrow tea can help warm you up). If feet are cold after 1-2 minutes of application, get up and warm feet and reapply cold socks (may need to re-dunk in ice water and wring out again if they've lost their chill). 5. Go directly to bed for the night, wearing the socks. During the night, you may wake up with your whole body wet from sweat. If so, change into the dry pajamas, but leave the socks on. Remove the socks in the morning, or when they are DRY. IMPORTANT: socks should be left on until they are warm and dry, otherwise the process is depleting. Do NOT perform this treatment if you: are debilitated and cannot heat the compress are chilled or have low body temperature (less than 98\u00b0F orally): hot ginger or yarrow tea and/or a hot bath or foot soak will increase your body temperature have a skin condition that's aggravated by prolonged moist applications if you are pregnant, temperature of bath must not be too hot for too long have a high fever Overall effects: Increases circulation Derivative, heating effect Sedative effect Stimulates immune system Tonifies tissues Please note: This information is for educational purposes only.
