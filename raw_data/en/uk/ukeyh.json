Discount Prescription Cards Prescription drug discount cards allow cardholders to save money on all types of prescription medications. Cards are available online, at no cost, and can be used with or without insurance. At the time of purchase, cardholders simply present their card at a participating pharmacy to instantly receive substantial discounts on their prescription drugs. These cards typically offer the best price on generic medications. The websites also allow individuals to search for the best price on their medication at nearby pharmacies based on zip code. | | America's Pharmacy |888-495-3181| | | ScriptSave Well Rx | | GoodRX | | 855-268-2822 | | America's Drug Card | | | | Needymeds | | Additional tips for affording your medications: - If you can not afford your brand-name medication, talk to your doctor about whether a generic version is available. Generic medications contain the same active ingredients as the brand name version, often at a much lower cost. - Discount prescription cards are available online at no cost, and have no eligibility requirements. These are a great option if you are not eligible for other assistance programs. - Before changing health insurance, check how much your medication will cost on the new plan. - If you find that your insurance company places all hepatitis B medications on the highest pricing tier, then your plan may be discriminating against people with chronic hepatitis B. Learn more about discriminatory drug pricing and how to report it here: [https://www.hepb.org/resources-and-support/know-your-rights/us-access-to-medicine/](resources-and-support/know-your-rights/us-access-to-medicine/) - Serious liver damage can occur if you suddenly stop taking your hepatitis B medication, or if you take it inconsistently. If you can not afford your current medication, talk to your doctor about other options. Do not cut pills, skip doses, or stop medication unless you are under the care of a knowledgeable doctor. "}
