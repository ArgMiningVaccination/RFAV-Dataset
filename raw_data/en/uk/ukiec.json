Just as pure as any other of oil. But do you have any scientific papers or certification that the oil is \"pure\"? Oil isn't some magical substance, it's makeup depends upon its source and manufacturing process (which is why petroleum oil is refined and purified). It's why fish oil has any health benefits, it contains omega-3. This is why the FDA exists (well, partly). They ensure the safety of drugs being used, its why Tylenol needs to be 99.9% pure. If fish oil isn't 99.9% omega-3, how do you know what that other percentage is?[url=http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=26525857#p26525857:1roak2sn said:CraigJ[/url]\":1roak2sn] Fish oil is just as pure as any other type of oil. Olive, flax-seed, cornflower, etc. Besides fish oil is a nutritional supplement, not a drug. The other 99.9% is fish oil Whole milk is 4% other 96%?

Just an aside, but herbal remedies have the opposite problem compared to homeopathic ones in that they contain actual chemical ingredients that have actual effects on the human body. But people don't know it and accept herbal remedies as being safe because they're \"natural\".

We have to do a lot of testing to prove that our product does what it says and determine any ill effects. The fact that these homeopathic \"medicine\" makers can advertise a product to treat anything and produce them in a shady environment worries me. It's about time we give the FDA to actually act on and make these products go through the same clinical trials and tests that legit drugs and devices go through now. [You mean like how they regulated Fen-Phen?]You guys can downvote me into oblivion again but it doesn't change the facts. The FDA has approved some massively dangerous drugs (and later recalled them) knowing full well they were dangerous. Fen-Phen just happens to be a great example of this. However, the medical officer of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Leo Lutwak, insisted upon a black box warning of pulmonary hypertension risks. After Lutwak refused to approve the drug, the FDA management had someone else sign it and approved the drug with no black box warning for marketing in 1996.[1] European regulators required a major warning of pulmonary hypertension risks. Considering the fact that isolating the enantiomers is relatively easy/cheap (compared to developing new drugs), gets an almost automatic stamp of approval from FDA and extends patents - I take the claims of major effects with a grain of salt.[url=http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=26530365#p26530365:2vko60sc said:TheWomanInTheMachine[/url]\":2vko60sc][url=http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=26530271#p26530271:2vko60sc said:onkeljonas[/url]\":2vko60sc]In some ways we're progressing very fast, but there is quite far between the real pharmaceutical progress.

But of course the failings of the pharmaceutical industry isn't an argument in favor of homeopathy. True. COX-2 Inhibitors would come under the category of a variation that proved to be terrible. They were created to be specific to the enzyme Cyclooxygenase 2 and be better, more specific and have less side effects than the general NSAIDs. But then it turned out that they were responsible for an increase in the risk of heart attack and stroke in patients receiving them and a few of them were even taken off market. Still, they are more the exception rather than the rule. Recent advances in pharmacology also focus on isolating D(dextrorotatory) or L(levorotatory) enantiomers of a drug. Take the common over-the-counter anti-histamine cetrizine. It is now available almost exclusively in the form of the L isomer because it has greater pharmacological activity. So sometimes small variations can have a major effect I AM allergic to penicillin, not that I would buy this crap. But still, pretty alarming.[url=http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=26521261#p26521261:2cg8shnl said:charleski[/url]\":2cg8shnl]Even if you aren't allergic to penicillin, widespread use of low, sub-clinical doses is still incredibly harmful, as it merely promotes antibiotic resistance.
