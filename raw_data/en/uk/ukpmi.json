She tried all methods to lose weight by going through different diet regimes and gym training but she would not lose the desired weight. She would get easily tired even if she would not work much. She was all the time anxious about her life as she had done a love marriage 2 years ago and things were not going well with her husband. She was advised to do a thyroid test and her thyroid hormones were abnormally high. After detailed case history she was given homoeopathic medicine with diet changes and exercise routines. Slowly and steadily she improved and over a period of 3months the thyroid hormone levels were back to normal. She lost weight and looked more confident. She continued with homoeopathic treatment for 1year and the thyroid hormones were normal. Unexplained weight gain, constipation, Sluggishness, Fatigue; Lack of Energy, Dry skin, Depression, Increased sensitivity to cold, Impaired memory, hair thinning, Muscle aches and pains, Heavier than normal or irregular menstrual periods, slower heart rate are common symptoms of Hypothyroid.

Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (thyroid gland enlarges and forms goitre), Thyroid destruction following secondary to radioactive surgery, Severe iodine deficiency and Stress are known to cause Hypothyroid. A routine blood test for thyroid hormones would confirm the diagnosis. Healing with Homoeopathy Homoeopathy helps to produce thyroid hormone naturally by stimulating the immune system and helps in better functioning of the thyroid gland. Homoeopathic remedies work by stimulating the body's own healing capacity by encouraging the body to reactivate hormone secretions. Homeopathy is free from any side-effects. Stress causes hormonal disturbances in the body like thyroid problems and is very effectively treated with homeopathy. Homoeopathy is a mind-body medicine.
