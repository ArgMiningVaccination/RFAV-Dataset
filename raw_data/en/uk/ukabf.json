This article delves into this increasingly fragrant market and provides an in depth guide to aromatherapy for the perfumer and consumers' perspective. Where Does The Word Aromatherapy Come From? What is this elusive fragrant thing called aromatherapy and...what does it want? Derived from two obvious words, aroma, meaning fragrance or smell and therapy, indicating treatment, the name was first coined back in 1937 when a French chemist named [Rene-Maurice Gattefosse](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren\u00e9-Maurice_Gattefoss\u00e9), accidentally burned his hand in his laboratory and found that lavender oil helped to heal it. This inspired him to further investigate the healing power of essential oils. In 1937 he published Aromath\u00e9rapie: Les Huiles Essentielles, Hormones V\u00e9g\u00e9tales, a book concerning the anti-microbial benefits of essential oils. Aromatherapy Within The Ancient World Little is known about the specific origins of aromatherapy, but the ancient Egyptians are credited with developing one of the world's first distillation machines. These were used exclusively to extract precious oils from certain plants, which were used in their embalming rites. These included cedar-wood, [clove](/blog/how-clove-essential-oil-enhances-fragrances/) and cinnamon among others. A papyrus dating back to circa 1555 BC contains remedies that can be found in herbal medicine today for illnesses of all types. The Egyptians also developed the process known as infusion to extract selected oils from aromatic plants, the earliest use of which was probably frankincense, which they burned as a sunrise offering to Ra, the sun god, and myrrh was the standard offering to the moon. They also used essential oils to add fragrance to their bathing rituals. The Ancient Greeks and Aromatherapy According to Greek mythology, the ancient gods were blessed with the sacred knowledge of perfume and fragrance. Essential oils were used both medicinally and in cosmetics. A Greek perfumer named Megallus developed an early fragrance that was entirely comprised of myrrh. Hippocrates, \"the father of medicine,\" used essential oils for healing. Pedacus Dioscorides, a Greek physician, wrote an important book on herbal medicine entitled Materia Media, which to this day is considered a standard medical reference text. Many of his recorded remedies are still utilized today by those who practice aromatherapy. The Sweet-Smelling Romans and the Chinese Although the Romans adopted much of their knowledge of medicine from the ancient Greeks, their love of bathing encouraged them to further develop aromatics for this daily ritual that so dominated their culture. Applying oil and massaging their bodies were considered part of the bathing rite, and aromatic oils and perfumes found their way to Rome via East India and Arabia through the opening of trade routes. During The Crusades, the use and knowledge of aromatic oils and fragrances spread to [the Far East](/blog/middle-eastern-fragrances/) and Arabia. The concept of using infused essential oils as mood enhancers is believed to have originated in China. The time frame is thought to coincide with that of ancient Egypt's use of aromatic essential oils. They used essential oils and burned fragrant woods and incense to show respect to God. The oldest surviving medical text in China is Shen Nung's Herbal Book, which is dated about 2700 BC. It is a compendium of information on more than 300 plants and includes aromatic massage as one of its many aspects. The Aztecs And Their Use Of Essential Oils Lastly, the Conquistadores were amazed at the wealth of medicinal plants and aromatic oils found in Montezuma's botanical gardens. The. Aztecs were well known for their plant remedies. The North American Indians also used aromatic oils for their own herbal recipes. With the advent of the 19th century, came a time of inquiry from scientists in Europe who began researching the effects of essential oils on bacteria in humans. The Suggested Benefits of Aromatherapy Even though academic research on the effectiveness of aromatherapy and particularly the therapeutic use of essential oils is limited, according to the Mayo Clinic, there have been studies done that suggest aromatherapy does have some health benefits. These include: relief from depression and anxiety, improved sleep patterns, and with use of lavender oil specifically, the reduction of pain from both kidney stones and osteoarthritis of the knee. Perhaps the most widespread and popular use of aromatherapy is its ability to reduce or eliminate stress. This aspect of aromatherapy is well studied.

They are not intended as stand alone treatments for depression, and are best used as complementary adjuncts to professional counseling and treatment. Studies have also shown the efficacy of aromatherapy on memory enhancement among young patients. Sage oil is the most commonly recommended oil for achieving this effect. Many essential oils are known to increase circulation, raise energy levels, and generally stimulate the body and mind, without the dangerous side effects of other potentially negative stimulating substances. The best essential oils for getting an energy boost include: cinnamon, black pepper, cardamom, clove, angelica, jasmine, tea tree, rosemary, and sage. How exactly Does Aromatherapy work?

Frankincense Commonly used in aromatherapy, the word comes form the Old French word, franc encens, which means 'quality incense'.

Also known as olibanum, this essential oil offers a wide variety of health benefits including: relief from chronic stress and anxiety, boosting immunity and relieving pain and inflammation.

Neroli An essential oil extracted from the fragrant flowers of the bitter (Seville) orange tree, neroli was discovered in the late seventeenth century and is named after a princess, Anna Maria de la Tremoille. This essential oil and the therapeutic properties of its flowers were highly valued by the Venetians who rubbed a distilled water into their bodies twice a day as protection against the plague and other fevers.
