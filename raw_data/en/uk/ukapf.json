Any mistakes remain, ho wever, the r esponsibility of the authors.ACKNO WLEDGEMENTSMALARIA RESEARCH : ANAUDIT OFINTERNA TIONAL 5This study of the global malaria r esearch effor t over the past decade had its origins in the simple wish of the W ellcome T rust to obtain an objectiv e review of the r esearch outputs fr om its o verseas units. That objectiv e was subsequently expanded to accommodate the v aluable suggestions made b y members of the S teering Committee established for this ' audit ' and b y the T rust's Tropical M edicine I nterest G roup. Particularly impor tant w ere the suggestions to seek opinion fr om 'users' as well as fr om the practitioners of malaria r esearch and to examine the effectiv eness with which r esearch findings hav e been translated into practice. Many individuals and organizations hav e collaborated in this pr oject and hopefully they will find this r eport both of inter est and of v alue. The authors hav e sho wn remar kable persistence in their pursuit of the data needed for this study and fe w organizations hav e failed to r espond to requests for information. I t is hoped that they also will find the study of v alue. Some r esearchers hav e expr essed a concern that the objectiv e of the 'audit ' might hav e been to r educe the funding for malaria r esearch. However, at a time when the synthetic antimalarials dev eloped in the middle y ears of this centur y are appr oaching the end of their useful life and the malaria v accine r emains a desirable y et unachiev able goal, the report reveals that the suppor t for malaria r esearch by sev eral of the major funding agencies has fallen significantly in r ecent y ears and highlights the v ery low lev el of industr y-based r esearch on this disease. It is to be desir ed that this r eport will stimulate a gr eater lev el of malaria research activity in both the public and priv ate sectors. The authors merit comment for their enthusiasm for this pr oject and for the diligence and car e with which the r eport has been constr ucted. The complexity of the ex ercise has pr esented both a major challenge and a v ery large wor kload but the final r eport mor e than justifies their efforts. R E H owells Programme D irector The W ellcome ODUCTION r ecogniz ed as a major and incr easing threat to world health. D isease pr evalence is escalating and distribution expanding as r esis- tance to antimalarial dr ugs and insecticides spreads. N ew and impr oved appr oaches to dis - ease pr evention, tr eatment and contr ol ar e requir ed and pr esent an urgent challenge to the underpinning sciences. Ther e is a pr essing need for r esearch in the field of malaria, and for the effectiv e translation of r esearch results into practical application. The limited av ailability of funds for r esearch, in any scientific field, dictates that suppor t must be focused, and it would seem self-evident that futur e funding policies of organi - zations inv esting in biomedical r esearch need and evidence-based. Aneffectiv e, overarching appr oach to the assess - ment of r esearch activity in a field can help inform the decision-making pr ocess. This report presents the r esults of one such study , which examined international r esearch activity in the field of malaria. The study was under taken using a set of no vel analytic techniques dev eloped b y the U nit for Policy R esearch in Science and M edicine (PRISM). The purpose was to generate infor - mation that could help the W ellcome T rust in its policy decisions on the most effectiv e means of suppor ting malaria r esearch in the futur e. During the course of the study , it became clear that the information pr oduced may also be of some v alue to individuals and other organiza - tions which fund, manage or conduct malariaresearch. The key findings ar e ther efore being published to pr ovide a factual base of evidence to help inform discussions on malaria r esearch policy mor e broadly . The study examined the funding inputs to malaria r esearch internationally , as w ell as the published outputs and br oader outcomes, such as impr ovements in clinical tr eatment and development of ne w therapeutic pr oducts. I naddition, the study examined r esearch oppor - tunities and also r esearch ar eas requiring an input of r esour ces. O pinion was sought on barriers per ceived to be limiting the translation of research results into practice, and on mea - sures to tackle these obstacles. MAIN ST AGES OF THE STUD Y The study comprised fiv e analytical stages. nA sur vey of international funding for malaria r esearch over the past decade. nAn analysis of malaria publications and citations, o ver the same time period, to identify r elativ e outputs and scientific impact by differ ent countries and funding bodies. nAn assessment of publishing activity in the subfields of malaria r esearch to elucidate the balance of effor t betw een subfields. nA qualitativ e assessment of the por tfolio of publications arising fr om research suppor ted by the W ellcome T rust to identify the achiev ements as w ell as the balance of the Trust's portfolio of malaria r esearch output. nAn opinion sur vey of the malaria com- munity - inv olving r esearchers as w ell as funders and users of r esearch - on the main issues of r esearch, the translation of research r esults into practice and key futur e ANAUDIT OFINTERNA TIONAL ACTIVITY SUMMAR Y MAIN FINDINGS Funding Total identifiable global expenditur e on malaria r esearch in 1993 was appr oximately US$84 million. Ov er half the total came fr om the USA (especially the US Agency forInternational D evelopment, USAID, and the National I nstitute of Allergy and I nfectious Diseases, NIAID). M uch of the r emainder came fr om E urope (notably the W ellcome Trust and the M edical R esearch Council, MRC, in the UK), or fr om the P rogramme in Research and T raining in T ropical D iseases (TDR) which is cosponsor ed by the U nited Nations D evelopment P rogramme, the W orld Bank and the W orld H ealth O rganization (WHO), as w ell as sev eral go vernments, espe - cially in Scandinavia. Funding has declined in some organizations over the past decade, most notably in USAID. However, ther e hav e been incr eases else wher e, especially at the W ellcome T rust, NIAID and the US D epartment of D efense (D oD). Suppor t went mainly to r esearchers in E urope and the USA. The ex ceptions w ere to be found in the funding initiativ es of the TDR pr o- gramme, the W ellcome T rust, the UK MR C, the E uropean U nion (EU) and USAID, which encouraged international cooperation.Notable among these w ere the o verseas units suppor ted in malaria-endemic countries b y the Wellcome T rust and the UK MR C. The o verall conclusion to be drawn is that global investment in r esearch is v ery low compar ed with other disease ar eas over the past 10 y ears, and appears to be declining fur ther. Expressed as investment in r esearch per death, malaria research (at appr oximately US$42 per fatal case) receives mar kedly less funding than other dis - eases such as cancer , HIV/AIDS or asthma. Resear ch outputs International publishing activity largely reflected the pattern of funding and was v ery low compar ed with other biomedical fields.The USA is curr ently the largest single con - tributor to the malaria r esearch literatur e (34 per cent of the global total in 1994), but itsworld shar e of publications has been declining over the past 10 y ears (fr om 42 per cent in 1984). M eanwhile, the tr end fr om the UK is up, from 14 per cent of the world total in 1984 to 18 per cent in 1994. The world shar e of malaria publications fr om F rance, A ustralia and Thailand also incr eased. UK centr es for collaborativ e research located in malaria-endemic countries appear ed to fos - ter international coauthorship . A total of 38 per cent of UK output was internationallycoauthor ed and largely r eflected the wor k at the o verseas units of the W ellcome T rust and UK MR C. Citations to papers suppor ted b y the six fund - ing bodies contributing most to malariaresearch were mor e numer ous than citations to papers suppor ted b y other organizations. I n 1989, the most r ecent y ear for which citation analysis was conducted, NIAID and the UKMRC appear ed to hav e the gr eatest citation impact. F or fiv e organizations, the pr oduction of high-citation-impact papers r emained mor e or less stable o ver time. These w ere the NIAID, the US D oD, TDR, the W ellcome T rust and the UK MR C. F or one funding body (USAID), ther e was an appar ent decline in its proportion of high-impact papers o ver time. Activity in diff erent subfields of malaria r esear ch The field of malaria r esearch was divided into 14 subfields, and r esearch publications w ere assigned to each of these. 'Clinical ' research papers accounted for 42 per cent of the worldtotal, describing studies of malaria in humansranging fr om clinical management and patho - physiology to human immune r esponse and genetic susceptibility . 'Non-clinical ' papers accounted for 58 per cent of the world total,describing studies of malaria in animal modelsor in vitr oand basic studies on mosquito ACTIVITY 8International r esearch , as measur ed by publication output in thr ee selected y ears, was evenly distributed acr oss most categories of malaria r esearch. P ublications w ere most numer ous in two major r esearch categories: (i) clinical tr eatment and pathophysiology , and (ii) basic science studies of the parasite.Research into antimalarial dr ugs, immunol - ogy, epidemiology and mosquito v ectors w ere also w ell r epresented b y publications. Intervention trials and health ser vices r esearch appear ed to hav e less publishing activity . Based on the addr ess of the first author only , the USA dominated all subfields ex cepting those r elating to clinical medicine and patho - physiology . UK authors published most frequently in pathophysiology and disease symptoms, wher eas Thailand was the world leader in clinical management of malaria anddrug trials. H igh coauthorship betw een researchers in the UK and Thailand suggested that the UK also had an impor tant r ole in that area. The W ellcome T rust por tfolio of malaria r esear ch Papers ackno wledging the W ellcome T rust were sent out for r eview by 13 subfield exper ts. The por tfolio of papers included publications in 11 subfields, two of which w ere especially well represented: pathophysiology and clinical disease symptoms, as w ell as clinical tr eatment and management of malaria. B asic studies of the parasite w ere also w ell represented. Outputs in differ ent subfields largely r eflected funding inputs. H owever, publications w ere low relativ e to expenditur e in thr ee demiology services r esearch. Conv ersely , outputs w ere high r elativ e to inputs for studies on both the biology and the biochemistr y of the parasite. The W ellcome T rust's research outputs w ere consider ed by reviewers to make a contribu - tion Realization of practical benefits fr om T rust- funded r esearch was largely expected b y the reviewers within fiv e years of publication. Curr ent pr actice and futur e directions of malaria r esear ch The vie ws of o ver 200 members of the malaria community w ere sought on issues concerning current practice and futur e dir ections in malaria r esearch. A total of 115 individuals responded to the sur vey, including r esearchers, clinicians, health ser vices managers and practi - tioners, industrialists and administrators inboth malaria-endemic and non-endemiccountries. Of the 14 subfields analysed, parasite genetics and parasite biology w ere identified most fr e- quently as having v ery good pr ospects for advancing kno wledge o ver the next fiv e years. The subfield concerning inter vention trials and health ser vices r esearch was consider ed to be most under-r esour ced, consistent with the low publication output identified in that sub - field. I ncreased r esour ces w ere also consider ed necessar y for r esearch on: basic studies of the parasite, epidemiology , immunology and v ac- cine dev elopment, and antimalarial dr ug development. I nvestment was r ecommended in these subfields and in human capital. However, research is characteriz ed b y uncer tainty , and r espondents anticipated that the pr obable sequencing of the malaria genome within the next fiv e years may lead to new challenges and oppor tunities hither to unidentified. More than two-thir ds of r espondents indi - cated experience in pr ojects wher ch results w ere dev eloped to impr ove the tr eat- ment or contr ol of malaria. H owever, half of all the r espondents also indicated that they knew of r esear ch results that might hav e influenced malaria tr eatment or contr ol but were not dev ther identified a number of key obstacles to the uptake of r esear ch results for practical application in malaria tr eatment and contr ol. These obstacles included: insuf - ficient orientation of r esear public needs in malaria-endemic countries;inadequate standar dization of field tech - niques; inadequate assessment of r esear ch results and dev elopment of applications; and resour ce limitations in malaria-endemic countries. Several possibilities emerged fr om the sur vey for o vercoming the per ceived barriers to research uptake. O ne appr oach would be to strengthen existing mechanisms for ev aluating research results for their potential uptake in programmes of malaria tr eatment and contr ol. This might inv olve establishing a centr e to prepare, maintain and disseminate systematic reviews of the r esults of malaria r esearch. Related to this was the per ceived need for a mechanism to dev elop ne w products fr om the results of r esearch that would contribute to the treatment and contr ol of malaria. The sur vey also indicated a need for impr oving activ e communication betw een pr ofessional gr oups with an inter est in malaria (both r esearchers and non-r esearchers), and for cr eating mor e training oppor tunities for r esearchers based in malaria-endemic countries. The challenge This study has demonstrated the potential thatmalaria r esearch has to make a significant con - tribution to the tr eatment and contr ol of one of the world 's most thr eatening diseases. G iven this, the lo w level of funding globally is striking. This r eport points to some of the ar eas of greatest need and oppor tunity for the field: scientific subfields with pr omise ar e high - lighted, as ar e oppor tunities for impr oving the management and organization of the r esearch enterprise. H owever, the challenge is too gr eat for any one funding body . In reaching to meet the v arious needs and seiz e the oppor tunities identified in this r eport, ther e is a clear needfor an international, collaborativ e appr oach, involving all of the main national and interna - tional organizations with an inter est in malaria. The challenge is clear , and this study calls for a coor dinated r esponse fr om the inter - national malaria community . LESSONS FOR FUTURE STUDIES The study has described a number of both quantitativ e and qualitativ e methods used to pr oduce an evidence-based r eport on the status and futur e options in malaria resear ch. I n order to guide similar studies which might be conducted in the futur e, a number of general points should be madeconcerning the appr oach and techniques used in this study . Assessing funding inputs Direct contact with funding agencies pr o- vided detailed information on funding andpermitted confirmation of the data once theyhad been analysed. H owever, this appr oach was time-consuming and limited b y the extent of the r esponse. An analysis of funding ackno wledgements in publications rapidly and compr ehensiv ely identified the larger contributors to malaria r esearch, as w ell as the smaller contributors, but did not pr ovide data on the amount of suppor t from each organi - zation. Analysing pub lications outputs The limitations of commer cially av ailable databases - such as the Science Citation I ndex and M edline - suggest that the choice of one database or the other , or indeed the use of both databases, must be car efully consider ed accor ding to the aim of a par ticular analysis. Furthermor e, the effects of using a small num - ber of publications in an analysis, such as forthe citation analysis of par ticular funding bodies, should be r ecogniz ed. Defining subfields The dev elopment of a classification system for dividing the field of malaria into a number ofEXECUTIVE is tant to r ecogniz e the subjectiv e natur e associated with the defin - itions of the subfields, although ev ery effor t was made to use pr ecise definitions and to minimiz e subjectivity . Conducting an e xper t review of publications The use of an exper t review of published papers pr ovided a r etrospectiv e analysis of the achiev ements of r esearch and the identification of oppor tunities arising fr om that r esear ch. It provided a complementar y appr oach to citation analysis and allo wed for a detailed qualitativ e assessment of the publications in a field. The use of subfield exper ts allo wed for an informed assessment. H owever, in thisparticular case, the small number of both publications and exper ts per subfield, limited by the siz e of the por tfolio itself , suggest that caution is r equir ed in the interpr etation of the findings. Conducting a community-wide sur vey A key featur e of the community sur vey was its breadth acr oss pr ofessional gr oups and geo - graphical boundaries. I deally , such sur veys should aim to sample opinion fr om researchers as well as the users of r esearch results, and fr om professionals based in malaria-endemic as w ell as those in non-endemic countries. Thisprocess can pr ovide an oppor tunity for all groups to expr ess their opinions and raise mutual awar eness of br oader issues of policy as well as of r esearch.EXECUTIVE SUMMAR YMALARIA RESEARCH : ANAUDIT OFINTERNA O THE MAL ARIA STUD Y This r eport presents the r esults of an interna - tional study of past activity and futur e options in malaria r esearch. The origins of this wor k lay in a study commissioned b y the W ellcome Trust, to help inform its policy decisions on the most effectiv e means of suppor ting this field of r esearch in the futur e. D uring the course of the study , it became clear that the large quantity of original data and informationbeing collected might also be of some v alue to individuals and other organizations whichfund, manage or conduct malaria r esearch. The key findings of the study ar e ther efore being published to pr ovide a factual base of evidence to inform individual inv estigators and to suppor t organizations dev eloping futur e policies for malaria r esearch. Ther e hav e been pr evious r eviews of malaria research and contr ol. The most significant recent attempt to r eview this field and gather hard data was under taken b y the I nstitute of Medicine in the USA (O aks et al., 1991). The aim of that study was primarily to make r ec- ommendations to the US go vernment, and it therefore focused mainly on gathering data from US funding organizations. V aluable qual - itativ e information was pr oduced concerning the status of malaria r esearch and contr ol worldwide, as w ell as identifying the decline in suppor t by the US go vernment o ver the period from 1987 to the r eport's publication in 1991. Another r ecent study b y an ad hoc committee convened b y the W orld H ealth O rganization (WHO, 1996) has a br oader focus on tr opical diseases. The r eport on that study r eviews investment r equir ements to tackle global health pr oblems, and pr ovides a v aluable con - text for mor e focused studies on single tr opical diseases such as malaria. While the I nstitute of M edicine study success - fully achiev ed its objectiv es, it did not attempt to pr oduce data on malaria funding in other countries, and ackno wledged the substantialdifficulties of doing so . However, the av ailabil - ity of such data is cr ucial when dev eloping a balanced international strategy for r esearch funding, and one of the goals of the pr esent study was to attempt a sur vey of malaria research funding internationally . An additional need, not co vered by previous reviews, is for data on the outputs from malaria research; funding data, of course, only r epre- sent an input to the r esearch system. F inally , previous r eviews hav e not attempted to canv ass opinion systematically fr om a wide base of professionals with an inter est in malaria research (both r esearchers and those who use the results of r esearch). Again, the information generated b y a large-scale, systematic consulta - tion of the malaria community can be impor - tant when dev eloping policies. 1.2 SCOP E OF THE MAL ARIA STUD Y This study encompassed the full spectr um of malaria r esearch fr om basic science thr ough clinical studies, epidemiological studies ofmalaria pr evalence, field trials, operational research and studies of the deliv ery of malaria treatment and contr ol measur es by health ser - vices and other organizations. Specifically , the study included the follo wing: nA sur vey of financial suppor t for malaria research internationally . nAn analysis of malaria publications and citations to assess the r elativ e outputs fr om differ ent countries and funding bodies. nA scientific subfield analysis of papers published in 1984, 1989 and 1994, withthe aim of determining the balance ofeffort betw een differ ent ar eas of r esearch within the field.INTR ODUCTION1MALARIA RESEARCH 121 INTR qualitativ e the scope and achiev ements of papers ackno wledging the suppor t of the W ellcome T rust with the aim of identifying the str engths and weaknesses of the T rust's por tfolio, within the context of the international malariaresearch effor t. nAn opinion sur vey of a div erse gr oup of malaria r esearchers and users of the r esults of malaria r esearch. The aim of the sur vey was to identify communication networ ks, mechanisms of dissemination of r esearch results, barriers to the uptake of r esults, measur es to str engthen the field, means of effectiv ely transferring r esearch r esults into practice, and key r esearch topics and oppor tunities for the futur e. The study was carried out o ver a period of 12 months and dr ew on a v ariety of data sour ces, published and unpublished, and a range ofexper t opinion. The wor k was carried out b y the W ellcome T rust's Unit for P olicy R esearch in Science and M edicine in collaboration with staff fr om the T rust's Tropical M edicine Science D ivision, and o verseen b y a S teering Committee. The o verall aim was to pr esent a data-driv en analysis of the field of malaria research to inform debate on futur e priorities. It is being published her e in or der to con - tribute to br oader debate on priorities for malaria r esearch. 1.3 PUBLIC HEAL TH SIGNIFICANCE OF MAL ARIA The global significance of malaria, in terms of both health and economics, is described prin - cipally in sev eral WHO documents ( WHO, 1993; 1995a, b , c, d). Malaria is a major killer which thr eatens 2400 million people, or about 40 per cent of theworld 's population. I t is r esponsible for 300-500 million clinical cases and betw een 1.5 and 2.7 million deaths per y ear. Even theselarge numbers ar e, however, likely to be under - estimates because of the pr oblems associated with r ecognizing and r eporting the condition. The disease has its major impact in sub- Saharan Africa wher e over 90 per cent of the worldwide cases ar e reported. A pproximately 10 per cent of hospital admissions and 20-30per cent of outpatient consultations in Africaare due to malaria. Asia and the Americas ar e thought to hav e some 5-20 million cases per year. Most of these, about 80 per cent, occur in Asia. The most serious ar eas of risk for contracting malaria in Asia and in Central andSouth America ar e at the fr ontiers of economic development, such as in the Amaz on basin wher e colonization and mining hav e greatly affected the envir onment, and in r egions of social disr uption, such as war z ones in Afghanistan and Cambodia. The incidence of malaria is on the incr ease. Ther e is gr owing r esistance to curr ent anti - malarial dr ugs in many ar eas, including multidr ug resistance in sev eral countries of Southeast Asia and Africa. I ncreasing insecticide resistance is also a major thr eat, as ar e changing agricultural practices, especially irrigation pr o- grammes in many malaria-endemic countries. Childr en ar e par ticularly at risk in r ural Africa wher e the disease is one of the major child - hood killers and r esponsible for the death of one in 20 childr en befor e the age of fiv e years. It is also the most common disease among school childr en and y oung adults in Africa wher e it tends to strike at har vest time, affect - ing pr oductivity . The disease causes anaemia in childr en and pr egnant women, and incr eases their vulnerability to other diseases. MALARIA RESEARCH : ANAUDIT OFINTERNA TIONAL ACTIVITY 131 INTR ODUCTION 1.4 ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE OF MAL ARIA In 1987 the estimated annual dir ect and indi - rect cost of malaria in Africa was US$800 mil - lion, and this figur e was expected to rise to more than US$1800 million b y 1995. The worldwide cost associated with malaria isundoubtedly higher , however, possibly r each- ing US$2000 million in 1995 (assuming thatAfrica has 90 per cent of the worldwide malariacases). For the contr ol of the disease alone, the WHO Action P lan for M alaria Contr ol, 1995-2000 (WHO, 1995c) has estimated US$28 million per annum of externalinvestment in malaria contr ol will be needed in Africa. O utside Africa, malaria contr ol programmes cost an estimated US$175-350 million a y ear. 1.5 THE DISEASE Excellent r eviews of the disease and its histor y are provided b y Bruce-Chwatt (1985), O aks etal. (1991), and the WHO (1993). An out - line of cer tain biological and historical aspects of the disease is giv en her e, but r eaders are referred to the abo ve texts for fur ther infor - mation. Malaria is a disease caused b y four species of protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium : P. falcipar um, P . vivax, P. ovaleandP. malariae. Plasmodium falcipar umis responsible for the most sev ere manifestations of the disease. The parasite matur es and r eproduces sexually in the mosquito Anopheles , and is transmitted through that v ector to humans. Transmission occurs thr ough the female mos - quito, which r equir es a blood meal for the development of her eggs. The parasite spor o- zoites, which enter the human blood with the saliva of the biting mosquito, inv ade the liv er cells wher e they dev elop and multiply .Merozoites, r eleased into the blood fr om the liver, invade the r ed blood cells and initiate the cycle of dev elopment and multiplication that brings about the clinical symptoms of the disease. Malaria is best thought of as a collectiv e name for differ ent diseases, since the epidemiology of malaria transmission and the sev erity of the disease v ary greatly fr om region to r egion, vil - lage to village, and ev en from person to person within a village. S ome of these differ ences will be due to the par ticular species of the parasite, the degr ee of compliance with a dr ug regimen, local patterns of dr ug resistance, and an indi - vidual 's immunity . 1.6 HIST ORY OF RESEAR CH AND OF MEASURES AIMED A T CONTR OL AND TREA TMENT OF THE DISEASE In the fifth centur y BC, H ippocrates discar ded superstition as a cause for the fev ers which afflicted ancient G reeks. H e recogniz ed the seasonality of the fev ers, and described the early clinical manifestations and complicationsof malaria. However, it was not until the sev enteenth centur y that a br eakthr ough occurr ed in the treatment of the malarial fev ers. The bar k of the P eruvian tr ee, Cinchona , was disco vered as the first therapy for the disease. The activ e principle of the bar k, quinine, was later isolated. The dev astating effects of malaria during the F irst W orld W ar stimulated research for synthetic antimalarial dr ugs, which w ere first disco vered in the 1920s (pamaquine) and 1930s (chlor oquine). Also at this time, a major disco very in the con - trol of malaria, thr ough the use of a natural insecticide, established the cornerstone ofmalaria contr ol. Pyrethrum, an extract of the chrysanthemum, was mix ed with ker osene and spray ed on the walls of houses. S everal MALARIA RESEARCH : ANAUDIT OFINTERNA w ere disco vered in the 1940s and became the stan - dards for contr ol programmes worldwide. Serious attempts to eradicate malaria began in the mid-1940s, and follo wing the S econd W orld War ther e was a high lev el of international coop - eration dev oted to eradicating malaria fr om endemic r egions. The U nited N ations Rehabilitation and R elief A dministration, an international emergency organization formed in1943, was v ery activ e in malaria contr ol mea - sures. The first E xpert Committee on M alaria, established b y the I nterim Commission of the World H ealth O rganization, met in 1947, and the W orld H ealth O rganization was officially formed in 1948. The pr ogramme was targeted to the eradication of the mosquito v ectors, thus pr eventing trans - mission of the parasite. The insecticide DDTemerged as the most effectiv e inter vention tactic, although sub-S aharan Africa was ex cluded fr om the eradication pr ogramme because it was felt that its malaria pr oblem was too large, and that this r egion lacked the technological capability . From the beginning it was r ealized that insecti - cide r esistance would be a pr oblem, and ther e was the fear that the mosquitoes would dev elop resistance befor e the disease could be wiped out. Although the eradication pr ogramme pr o- duced some dramatic r esults in many par ts of the world, it became clear b y the mid-1960s that eradication was not technically or eco - nomically feasible in many other r egions. I n 1969 the W orld H ealth Assembly r evised its global malaria eradication strategy , and its ne w approach encouraged contr ol wher e eradica - tion was not feasible. This emphasis on contr ol requir ed a long-term commitment of person - nel and financial r esour ces and also encour - aged malaria contr ol strategies to be integrated into the basic health ser vices pr ogrammes of individual countries. The change in policy didnot, ho wever, incr ease funding for malaria contr ol. N onetheless, ther e was a dramaticincrease in r esearch into ne w antimalarial drugs b y the US Armed F orces, which, at war in Vietnam, had encounter ed the major pr ob- lem of chlor oquine-r esistant P. falcipar um. In recent times, ther e has been considerable pressur e to r estrict the use of DDT on envi - ronmental/health/conser vation gr ounds. This has also had an adv erse effect on malaria con - trol effor ts. In addition, dr ug resistance for the prevention and tr eatment of malaria has become incr easingly pr evalent, with multidr ug resistance a major pr oblem in many endemic areas of the O ld and N ew World. It was r ecogniz ed in the late 1980s that the malaria situation in most par ts of the world was deteriorating, largely because of r elaxation of contr ol measur es and incr eased dr ug resistance. As a r esult, a WHO M inisterial Confer ence was held in Amster dam in 1992, with the par ticipation of ministers of health and other health wor kers fr om 102 countries, as well as r epresentativ es of the UN, other intergo vernmental organizations and the sci - entific community . The outcome of the con - ference was suppor t for a global malaria contr ol strategy ( WHO, 1993). It is incr easingly r ecogniz ed that malaria tr eat- ment and contr ol are issues which may hav e practical implications bey ond the curr ent geo - graphical delineation of the disease. I ncreasing global temperatur es hav e a potential impact on the pr evalence and incidence of tr opical dis - eases such as malaria (K err, 1995). W ithout adequate contr ol of the disease in the futur e, it can be anticipated that malaria will spr ead beyond its curr ent geographical boundaries. The incr eased pr ominence and distribution of malaria, as w ell as its curr ent pr evalence, indi - cates a need to take stock of the curr ent inter - national effor t in malaria r esearch. The pr esent study will, hopefully , contribute both b y pro- viding har d data and clear evidence of past trends, and b y offering insight to futur e needs and oppor tunities in this field of r esearch.MALARIA RESEARCH : AN AUDIT OF INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITY 15FUNDING INPUTS TO RESEARCH 2 2.1 METHODS Over the 10 year period covered in the study, there have been significant differences in therelative rates of research cost inflation and liv-ing cost inflation. The much higher rate ofresearch cost inflation has meant that thedecrease in research purchasing power has beenmuch faster than that for general commodities.This has meant that less research can be pur-chased now than before, relative not only toabsolute money but also to other commodities.In what follows, an attempt has therefore beenmade to take account of these effects whendrawing comparisons between funding bodiesin different countries. Funding organizations were identified through literature searches and scientific attach\u00e9s inLondon-based embassies. Each organization wascontacted for information on its overall researchexpenditure and on malaria research expenditurefor the 10-year period 1984/85-1993/94.Organizations were asked to search their grant records (titles or abstracts) for awards relatingto malaria or mosquito vectors of malaria, and,where possible, to provide a list of all grantsidentified. Lists of grants, where provided,were analysed by the audit team to ensure consistency of analysis. However, in somecases, organizations provided data in a pre-processed form. All funding bodies that con-tributed data were given an opportunity tocheck the accuracy of their coverage in thereport, and most did so. The following points should be noted: nAlthough every effort was made to obtain comparable data, it cannot be assumed thatall funding organizations classify theirgrants in the same way. Many organizationsdo not have computerized record systemsand even within organizations, changes inclassification systems may have occurredover the time period studied. This chapter presents the results of a survey of national and international funding support for malaria research. The surveyaimed to identify the main sources of funding for research into thedisease and to analyse trends over the past 10 years, drawing onoriginal data provided by research funding organizations around the world. For the purposes of this study, malaria research included the following: all research ranging from fundamental cellular and molecular studiesto applied clinical, epidemiological and operational research studies(relating to the implementation of malaria treatment and controlmethods), and research on mosquito vectors of malaria.MALARIA RESEARCH : ANAUDIT OFINTERNA TIONAL ACTIVITY 162 FUNDING INPUT S TO RESEAR CH nThe specific period co vered in any financial y ear may v ary betw een organizations. F or example, wher eas the financial y ear for one funding body may run fr om 1 J anuar y to 31 D ecember , another agency may use the period fr om 1 October to 31 S eptember . nThe appr oach to classifying the allocated funds ver time also v aries betw een organ- izations. F or example, annual expenditur e may be giv en as either the amount spent or the amount awar ded in any one y ear. nThere may also be an element of double counting.1For example, some organizations allocate funds to the UNDP/W orld B ank/ WHO S pecial P rogramme for R esearch and T raining in T ropical D iseases (TDR) and as a consequence such funding mayappear in both the TDR data and thefunding agency in question. This wastaken into account wher e possible. nMost of the funding identified is extramural suppor t.2Intramural suppor t for malaria research is generally not included, but may be significant in countries wher e research is mostly funded thr ough ministries of health and block grants3to institutes.

F or the pur - poses of this r eport, FY 1993 has been identi - fied as that which is quoted b y each organization in one of the follo wing four manners: FY93; 1993; 1992/93 when 1993 forms the gr eater por tion of the y ear (e.g. October 1992-S eptember 1993); or 1993/94 when 1993 forms the gr eater por tion of the year (e.g. A pril 1993-M arch 1994). D ata for the six largest contributors to malaria r esearch, based on 1993 expenditur e, are presented first. These ar e follo wed by data for the medium- sized and smaller contributors (see T able 2.1). 2.2.1 Larger contributors US Ag ency f or International De velopmen t6: $15.1 million in FY 1993 The US Agency for I nternational D evelop- ment (USAID) is the for eign assistance arm of the US go vernment and pr ovides mor e finan - cial suppor t to malaria r esearch activities than any other US agency . Between financial y ears 1985 and 1993, USAID' s budget for health, child sur vival and AIDS activities incr eased from $450 million to $564 million, but then decreased in FY 1994 to $549 million. The total annual sum allocated to malaria r esearch and field pr ogrammes decr eased fr om $49 million to $15 million o ver the period FY 1985 and 1993, and to $9.7 million in 1994 (see F igure 2.1). As a pr oportion of USAID' s total expen - ditur e on health, this r epresented a decline from 11 to 3 per cent, and finally to 1.8 per cent in FY 1994. Figure 2.2 sho ws ho w USAID funding for malaria is divided betw een bilateral pr ojects and central pr ojects of which the M alaria V accine Development (MVD) pr oject is a major com - ponent. I n the USAID context, bilateral projects target malaria contr ol and ar e countr y- based pr ojects managed b y USAID M issions in the field. Central pr ojects ar e managed b y USAID/W ashington. The most mar ked change over the period FY 1985-1994 has been a sub - stantial decline in suppor t for bilateral pr ojects; between FY 1985 and 1991, almost two-thir ds (63 per cent) of USAID malaria funds w ent to suppor t bilateral pr ojects, but b y FY 1994 this had declined to 25 per cent. F unding for MVD was, in absolute terms, quite stable to FY 1993.However, as a per centage of the total malaria1Double counting r efers to the o verestimate of funding by a factor of tw o as a r esult of attributing the sameresear ch funds to tw o separate funding bodies. 2Extram ural suppor t is that which is ackno wledged in a publication fr om a sour ce that is diff erent fr om the address of the r esear cher. Intram ural suppor t is defined as that funding which is notackno wledged as extram ural funding and which is a pparent from the ad dress of the resear cher (e .g. suppor t to an institution established andmanaged b y a funding body). 3Block grants ar e grants which ar e given to fund a number of pr ojects. 4Price Indices ar e used to inflate or deflate actualfinancial data, eff ectively normalizing the data to aconstant base y ear. The base year selected in the cur rent report was 1992 (see National Science Boar d, 1993). 5Purchasing P ower Parities are the pr eferred standar d for calculating international expenditur e in r esear ch and development. The y account for the variable costs of buying g oods and ser vices in different countries, including the wages of scientists andother personnel (seeNational Science Boar d, 1993). 6Many governmental bodies in the USA emplo y a financial year which runs fr om 1 October to 30 September . Thus, FY 1993 = October1992-September 1993.MALARIA RESEARCH : ANAUDIT TIONAL ACTIVITY 172 FUNDING INPUT S TO RESEAR CH Funding organization United States Agency f or International De velopment (USAID)7 National Institute of Allerg y in ropical Diseases Pr ogramme9 Wellcome T rust (UK)10 Medical Resear ch Council (MRC) (UK) European Union (EU) National Institute of Health and Medical Resear ch (INSERM) (France) Centers f or Disease Contr ol (CDC) (USA)11 National Health and Medical Resear ch Council (NHMRC) (Australia) Overseas De (Canada)13 The Mexican g overnment14 Directorate General f or International Cooperation (DGIS) (The Netherlands) MacAr thur F oundation (JCM) (USA) Institute f or Scientific Resear ch for De velopment and Cooperation (ORST OM) (France) Others TotalFunding f or malaria resear ch ($ million 1992 base y ear) 15.1 13.1 ~11.6 9.07.16.82.62.32.21.81.61.41.21.11.01.0 ~5 ~84US$ million (adjusted to 1992 base year) 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 199450 4540353025201510 507The USAID figur e is for resear ch and field programmes. 8DoD data f or FY 1993 w ere not available .

Twenty-four pr ojects costing $7.9 million, or about $2.6 million per annum, inv olved 109 partners fr om differ ent countries. The rationale of the STD pr ogrammes is strengthening r esearch capabilities b y forging collaborativ e links betw een research institutions in Europe and dev eloping countries.

Malaria r esear ch funding in perspectiv e One way of looking at r elativ e research expendi - ture on differ ent disease ar eas is to calculate the number of deaths associated with a disease, andcompar e this with r esearch inv estment. A r ecent estimate puts global malaria deaths in 1993 at 2 million ( WHO, 1995d), and comparing this with the global r esearch expenditur e in the same year (fr om the pr esent study) pr oduces a figur e of about $42 per fatal case. Comparativ e figur es for other disease ar eas ar e difficult to obtain, but rough estimates may be made fr om data pub - lished b y WHO, as sho wn in T able 2.3. This approach suggests that r esearch expenditur e on malaria was about $65 per fatal case in the early1990s; a similar estimate to that for 1993 derived from the pr esent study . It should be noted that the main differ ence in these two estimates is that the $65 figur e is produced b y using an estimate of 926 400 malaria deaths per y ear, wher eas the $42 figur e is produced b y using the mor e recent figur e of 2 million deaths per y ear. Comparisons between data fr om the pr esent study and fr om figures in WHO publications suggest that global r esearch expenditur e per death for tuber culosis is of the same or der of magnitude as for malaria. H owever, research inv estment per fatal case is about 80 times gr eater for HIV/AIDS, and 20 times gr eater for asthma than it is for malaria. These differ ences ar e so great that they will not be mar kedly affected b y using alternativ e published estimates of the global mor tality rate for malaria. Another way of putting malaria r esearch expenditur e into perspectiv e is to compar e it with w ell-documented data on r esearch spend - ing on an established disease in an industrial - ized nation. T aking cancer in the UK as an example, it may be estimated that the totalpublic and non-pr ofit expenditur e in 1993 (including go vernment and charitable sour ces) was about $225 million (based on data fr om AMR C, 1994; MR C, 1994; D epartment of Health, 1995). This equates to about $1525 per UK cancer death (using a mor tality figur e of 147 461: O ffice of H ealth E conomics, 1995). I f research funding fr om industrial sources w ere included, this figur e would be Diseases Annual global r esear ch Global mor tality Estimated global expenditur e ($ (1990: thousands) resear ch expenditur e ($) (estimated fr om data f or1990-1992)26(Murray and Lopez,1994) per fatal case w orldwide (Michaud and Mur ray, 1996) (circa 1990) HIV/AIDS 952 290.8 3274 Asthma 143 181.3 789 Malaria 60 926.4 65 Tuberculosis 26 2015.5 13Table 2.3 Global e xpenditur e on r esear ch per associated death f or various diseases 26The figur es for ann ual global r esear ch expenditur e are estimated fr om data f or 1990-1992 fr om all sour ces - government and public agencies, non-pr ofit organizations, and thepharmaceutical industr y.MALARIA RESEARCH : ACTIVITY INPUT S TO RESEAR CH much higher . The most striking conclusion to be drawn fr om this is that public r esearch spend on this one disease, in one medium-sized nation, is mor e than twice the global spend on malaria r esearch from all sour ces. Taken together , the conclusion fr om these v ar- ious (albeit imper fect) comparisons is clear . Diseases such as cancer , as w ell as HIV/AIDS and asthma, r eceiv e mar kedly higher lev els of research funding than does malaria (and tuber - culosis). This is tr ue in terms of absolute lev els of funding and r esearch spend per death. Trends in interna tional suppor t Internationally , the USA is curr ently the largest contributor to malaria r esearch. H owever, over- all suppor t in the USA has been decr easing o ver the past 10 y ears. F igure 2.14 pr esents the change o ver time in the malaria spend b y the six largest inv estors, gr ouped b y geographical region, in malaria r esearch. The evident r educ- tion in USA spend can be attributed to thedecrease in the USAID budget. T otal malaria expenditur e in the UK has been incr easing over the past decade, and the W ellcome T rust has become a major global sponsor of malariaresearch. The UK also has an incr easing pr esence in funding r esearch carried out specifically in malaria-endemic countries. I ndeed, the com - bined r esearch expenditur e in those countries by the W ellcome T rust and the UK MR C exceeds the combined expenditur e of the TDR Programme and the EU in those same coun - tries. The W ellcome T rust, with nearly twice the spend in these countries compar ed with the MR C, suppor ts malaria r esearch in endemic countries at an amount which is v ery similar to that of the TDR P rogramme. Compr ehensiv e data on expenditur e by the private sector , such as the pharmaceutical industr y, could not be obtained. H owever, pri- vate-sector funding of malaria r esearch is expected to be small at pr esent. N onetheless, the incr easing w ealth -tries (in par r esearch inv estment in tr opical diseases by the dr ugs industr y of both malaria-endemic and non-endemic countries. The curr ent uncer tainty in the USA o ver the futur e of the so-called ' orphan dr ug tax cr edit' (Wadman, 1996) may influence inv estment into malaria r esearch by the American pharma - ceutical industr y. The cr edit, which has had broad suppor t from the dr ugs industr y, allows American companies to deduct half of thecosts of clinical testing of dr ugs which target diseases that ar e rare in the American popula - tion (defined as affecting fe wer than 200 000 Americans). H owever, the cr edit has no w expir ed without a clear indication of its renewal. This can only r educe the incentiv e for industrial inv estment in malaria r esearch.1985 199490 8070605040302010 0US$ million (adjusted to 1992 base y ear) USA TDRUKTotal Figur e 2.14: Funding f or malaria r esear ch from the major contributors b y geographical r egion (the r eduction in US spend can be attributed to a decrease in the USAID budget)MALARIA RESEARCH : AN AUDIT OF INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITY 31MEASURING OUTPUTS FROM RESEARCH 3 3.1 BACKGROUND 3.1.1 Research outputs and research outcomes The results of biomedical research include both outputs - such as new knowledge, papers andpatents - and outcomes - such as the develop-ment of new products or improvements in healthcare. Measurements of the outputs of research,which are more accessible than measurements ofthe outcomes, are explored in the present chapter. Direct outputs may be quantified by a number of methods which assume that for newknowledge to be of value to a wide audience, itmust be published. The method of bibliometrics(measurements of publication output) is theaccepted approach to assess direct output fromscientific activity. Bibliometrics capturesadvances in codified knowledge 27which are published in international journals. It does notmeasure advances in tacit knowledge, nor does itcover publications which are not included inpeer-reviewed international journals. However,research has indicated that there is a highcorrelation between the findings of bibliometricanalysis and other more qualitative approachesto assessing output (Narin, 1976). 3.1.2 Bibliometric analysis The current analysis of malaria researchemployed three bibliometric measures: the num-ber of publications, both internationally andnationally - a quantitative indicator of researchactivity; the number of citations to those publica-tions - a qualitative indicator of the direct impactof the publications; and the extent of coauthor-ship - an indicator of international collaboration.Analyses were based on three years of publication- 1984, 1989 and 1994 - which permitted trend analysis over a 10-year period. An assessment was also made, using acknow- ledgements quoted in the publications, of thesources of financial support for the research.Acknowledgements analysis is a valuable mech-anism which enables funding organizations toidentify, in an international context, the extentof their contribution to scientific outputs. Thisinformation helps the organizations to evaluatethe research they support and to develop newpolicies for the future. In the present study, thisanalysis also provided a double check on themajor sources of funding for malaria researchidentified in the funding survey. 3.1.3 Limitations of bibliometric analysis The databases used for the analyses were the Science Citation Index (SCI), produced by theUSA Institute for Scientific Information, andthe Research Outputs Database (ROD), devel-oped by the Wellcome T rust. Whereas the SCIincludes citation rates of publications, the RODlinks published papers to their acknowledgedsources of support. The SCI has been criticized as being biased towards the USA and Europe in terms of its jour-nal coverage. Indeed, estimates of the omission inSCI of publications by scientists in developingcountries is as much as 90 per cent (Sancho,1992). The missing publications, the so-called'grey literature', are published in local or non-English journals. This omission is an importantconsideration for the field of malaria, which pre-dominantly affects developing countries and is oflocal interest to researchers in those countries. In the previous chapter, an assessment of the funding provided for research was used as a proxy measure of scientific activity. Analternative approach to assessing activity is based on measures ofresearch output. The two approaches are complementary, andtogether allow for a robust analysis of the state of scientific activity ina particular field. 27Codified knowledge is that which is systematicallyexpressed in a language ornumber code. Tacitknowledge is that which or impliedwithout being stated.MALARIA RESEARCH : ANAUDIT OFINTERNA OUTPUT S FR OM RESEAR CH An alternativ e database pr oduced b y the USA National Librar y of M edicine, M edline, is thought to co ver a mor e compr ehensiv e set of journals r elated to medical r esearch, including those which ar e mor e clinically oriented as w ell as those written in a language other thanEnglish. M edline also has the adv antage of providing abstracts for most of its ar ticles. A comparison of the M edline and SCI databases in the field of malaria indicated that, o ver time, the number of publications specific toMedline was decr easing (F igure 3.1). Meanwhile, the number of malaria publica - tions specific to SCI was incr easing, as was the number of publications common to bothMedline and SCI. A major disadv antage of M edline is that it does not r ecord all the addr esses listed on a paper , but only that of the first author . Furthermor e, Medline does not pr ovide information concerning citations to published papers. F or these r easons, the bibliometric analysis pr e- sented in this chapter r elied on the SCI data - base. H owever, the M edline database was used in the subfield analysis of Chapter 4, wher e the benefits of the inclusion of an abstract, as w ell as the gr eater co verage of clinical and epidemi - ological journals, outw eighed limited number of author addr esses. As a clearly defined clinical ar ea, malaria pr e- sented fe wer pr oblems of definition than other mor e basic or multidisciplinar y research fields. P ublished papers w ere ther efore rela- tively easy to identify . As in all the analyses, the scope of the bibliometric studies includedresear ch on the malarial parasite and disease, as w ell as v ector studies and operational resear ch. F or comparativ e purposes, some data on the fields of tr opical medicine and biomedicine ar e also included.

A variety of methods exists to define a subject field for bibliometric analysis. These includeidentifying a specialist journal set or using aspecialist subject database, using co-citationanalysis, applying keywor ds to a general bio - medical database, or using an internationalclassification scheme (B almer and M artin, 1991; R ogers and Anderson, 1993). The method used in the pr esent study was the application of keywor ds to a general biomed - ical database. The field of malaria r esearch was defined in a two-step pr ocess sho wn belo w (Bo x 3.1). Three types of publication - ar ticles, notes and reviews - w ere included in the analysis. These types ar e consider ed to contain substantial original scientific material (Anderson et al., 1988; Ley desdor ff, 1988). Letters (apar t from those to Nature), meeting r eports, ne ws and editorials ar e vie wed as peripheral and w ere thus ex cluded fr om the analysis. In the first step , titles fr om the SCI w ere searched using a set of pr ecise keywor ds relat- ing to malaria r esear ch (antimalaria*, malari*, Plasmodium or Plasmodia*). This step pr o- duced a set of papers that w ere accepted unconditionally . In the second step , another set of keywor ds that r elated to antimalarialdrugs and mosquitoes was emplo yed in a search strategy that pr oduced a br oader range of publications, only some of which w ere rel- evant to malaria r esear ch. Irrelevant publica - tions w ere excluded b y sear ching for an additional set of keywor ds that r elated to other diseases transmitted b y mosquitoes or treated with antimalarial dr ugs. The r emain - ing conditional set of publications was thenmanually r eviewed in or der to eliminate those that w ere obviously bey ond the r emit of the study . The r esults of this two-step appr oach were combined to pr oduce a final total set of malaria publications. The sear ch strategy is shown in Annex 1. The field of tr opical med - icine was defined b y a similar pr ocess (Lewison and S eemungal, 1995), and data on the siz e of the field w ere included for compar - ative purposes. In order to determine the publication output for each countr y, malaria r ecords identified from the thr ee-year sample of the SCI w ere analysed on the basis of the addr esses of their authors. Addresses w ere analysed using integer counts. 28Consequently , the figur es should be interpr eted as the number or per centage of publications in which a countr y par ticipated (rather than the number or per centage of pub - lications ex clusiv ely pr oduced b y a countr y). This is a useful method of calculating andassessing publication data giv en incr easing col - laboration betw een institutions and betw een countries (Katz et al., 1995).

In integer anal ysis, each countr y address on a publication r eceives a whole , single n umber f or the publication - e .g. if a pa per has one UK ad dress and tw o US ad dresses, each of the UK and the US r eceives 1.0 publication count. Infractional anal ysis, each countr y address on a publication r eceives a fraction of the total n umber of countr y addresses on the publication - e .g. for the above example , each of the UK and the US r eceives 0.5 of a publication count. NB: itis also possible to anal yse publication output at theinstitutional rather than thenational le vel.MALARIA RESEARCH : ANAUDIT OFINTERNA ACTIVITY 343 OUTPUT S FR OM RESEAR CH Patterns of coauthorship of malaria papers betw een the UK and other countries w ere also analysed. An index of coauthorship was calculated using the total number of UK-foreign collaborations and the number of papers pr oduced b y the UK and the countr y being studied (Bo x 3.2). Financial suppor t for r esearch was assessed b y analysing ackno wledgements to funding bod - ies and, for intramural suppor t, addr esses on papers. This was done b y manually examining, in libraries, the ackno wledgements giv en on each malaria publication. Citations to papers published in 1984 and 1989 were counted for the fiv e years follo wing publi - cation - 1984 to 1988 and 1989 to 1993,respectiv ely. The citation data w ere from all documents index ed in SCI rather than on just articles, notes and r eviews. R eference or norm citation v alues w ere determined for each set (1984 or 1989) of malaria publications o ver each fiv e-year period. These v alues defined thr ee standar ds of citation fr equency - the 10 per cent norm, the 25 per cent norm and the 50 per centnorm. The 10 per cent norm defined thosepapers which r eceived the most citations - those which w ere in the top decile gr oup of citation counts. The 25 per cent norm defined thosepapers which w ere in the top quar tile gr oup of citation counts, and the 50 per cent normdefined those papers which r eceived mor e than the median number of citation counts. A separate analysis was conducted of the cita - tion counts of papers ackno wledging suppor t from each of the major funding organizations of malaria r esearch. B y comparing the citation profile for each major funding body with thatof the combined sample of malaria publica - tions, it was then possible to identify whetherthe research funded b y a par ticular organiza - tion had a gr eater or lesser citation impact than the combined sample norm. Given the limitations of the SCI database dis - cussed abo ve, the r esults pr esented belo w should be interpr eted with the potential bias toward Europe and the USA in mind. 3.3 RESUL TS 3.3.1 Publication output The total number of malaria papers identified in the thr ee-year sample was 2307, which r ep- resented an av erage of 17.8 per cent of all papers in tr opical medicine ( Table 3.1). The percentage incr ease in the number of malaria publications o ver the period was 82 per cent, significantly mor e than the 50 per cent increase in tr opical medicine papers o ver the same period. The countr y which par ticipated in the largest number of scientific publications in the thr ee years studied was the USA ( Table 3.2).

This v alue was similar to 1993 USA biomedicine publications as a whole. The UKhad the second highest shar e of global output in malaria at 16 per cent. This was higher thanthe o verall UK contribution to biomedical research in 1993. This finding is suppor ted b y other data which indicate that the UK per cent- age publication shar e ranges, for 16 br oad areas of biomedicine, fr om 6.9 per cent in physiology to 16.1 per cent in psy chiatr y (Lewison and S eemungal, 1995). R elativ e to other ar eas of biomedicine, F rance and Australia w ere also r elativ ely str ong in malariaresearch. Thr ee malaria-endemic countries - India, Thailand and K enya - also had a high share of global malaria publications. The malaria publication r ecord for each coun - try as a per centage of world total number of malaria publications is sho wn in F igure 3.2. I t is evident that ther e was a decline in output from the USA fr om o ver 40 per cent of the world total in 1984 to <35 per cent in 1994.Publication shar e also decr eased steadily in India.

A total of 142 out of 378 UK papers published in these y ears (38 per cent) w ere internationally coauthor ed. The coauthorship index indicated the str ength of collaboration in malaria r esearch betw een the UK and other countries. The higher the index,the str onger the association betw een the UK and that countr y. A value gr eater than 1.0 indi - cates that collaboration was gr eater than might be expected, giv en the number of malaria papers pr oduced and coauthor ed b y these countries internationally . As might be expected, the r esults indicate that UK collaboration was v ery high with the thr ee countries in which the W ellcome T rust and the MRC hav e their units o verseas - K enya, Thailand and The G ambia. Ther e was also high collaboration with M alawi and P apua New Guinea, indicating that additional inter - national links exist. H igh UK coauthorship with P apua N ew Guinea can be accounted for mainly b y collaboration with A ustralian scien - tists who hav e established field r esearch links there. Collaboration was lo wer betw een theUK and cer tain E uropean countries and the USA. UK coauthorship appear ed primarily to reflect collaboration with malaria-endemic countries, rather than geographical pr oximity . As the total number of UK malaria papers isrelativ ely small, it should be r ecogniz ed that collaboration b y individual r esearchers may influence the lev els of coauthorship with other countries. 3.3.3 Ackno wledgements to funding organiza tions The main funding bodies suppor ting malaria r esear ch ar e listed in T able 3.3 and Annex 2. A total of 2242 publications w ere examined for this analysis - 65 out of the2307 malaria publications identified fr om the SCI w ere not located, hence funding ackno wledgements for those publications could not be determined. An explicitackno wledgement to one or mor e funding bodies was identified in 78 per cent of thepublications examined.

However, a number of organizations appear ed in the funding ackno wledgements but not in the survey of funding. This was possibly a r esult of the difficulty in identifying the less ob vious funding bodies located in dev eloping coun - tries. These included, among others, theIndian Council of Science and I ndustrial Resear ch, the K enya M edical R the P apua N ew G uinea go vern- ment, and the H ealth and F amily W elfare Ministr y of I ndia (see Annex 2). Four industrial organizations w ere also identi - fied in the ackno wledgements analysis (see Annex 2). H offmann-La R oche, S mithKline Beecham, W ellcome F oundation / W ellcome plc (no w Glaxo Wellcome plc) and I mperial Chemicals I ndustries w ere each ackno wledged. These commer cial organizations clearly had an interest in malaria r esearch, but it is not poss- ible with these data alone to assess the extent oftheir inv estment. The ackno wledgements analysis for the six largest contributors is sho wn in F igure 3.4. The r esults ar e expr essed as the per centage share of the world 's malaria publications in each y ear. The analysis indicated that both the Wellcome T rust and the MR C sho wed an increase in their per centage shar e of world publications o ver each of the two periods, from 1984 to 1989 and fr om 1989 to 1994. The per centage shar e of ackno wledgements to the TDR declined o ver time, as did those to the US D epartment of D efense. Ther e was some fluctuation in ackno wledgements to both USAID and NIAID. 3.3.4 Citations to pub lications Citations to malaria papers published in 1984 and 1989 w ere analysed for the fiv e years fol - lowing publication.

Half of all 1984 malaria papers had fiv e or mor e citations in the fiv e-year period follo wing publication - the 50 per cent norm. O ne-quar ter of the publications had 11 or mor e citations - the 25 per cent norm. Finally , one-tenth of the publications had 23 or mor e citations - the 10 per cent norm. Thus, any papers which r eceiv ed 23 or mor e citations w ere in the top decile of the entir e 1984 set. P apers which r eceiv ed betw een 11 and 22 citations w ere in the top quar tile, and those which r eceiv ed betw een 5 and 10 cita - tions w ere abo ve the median of the entir e 1984 set. A similar analysis identified the norm v al- ues for the 1989 malaria publications: 4 for the50 per cent norm, 11 for the 25 per cent norm,and 22 for the 10 per cent norm. The citations to those publications which ackno wledged the six largest contributors w ere analysed separately in or der to identify whether the r esearch which they funded had a greater than expected impact in r elation to these norms (F igure 3.6). As a consequence of the integer-counting method used in theanalysis, those papers which ackno wledged more than one funding sour ce were attributed to mor e than one funding body . Thus, the analysis must be interpr eted as the par ticipa - tion of a funding organization, and not neces - sarily the ex clusiv e suppor t of that organization. F urthermor e, the small numberof papers inv olved in par ts of the analysis - for example, ther e were only 11 papers ackno w- ledging the W ellcome T rust in 1984 - should be recogniz ed. Citations to all funding organi - zations ex cluding the top six w ere aggr egated and included in the analysis for comparativ e purposes. Like wise, citations to papers which did not ackno wledge any funding body w ere aggregated and included in the analysis. Papers ackno wledging the suppor t of the six largest inv estors in malaria r esearch had mor e citations than the aggr egated set of all malaria papers. These r esults indicate that the wor k of the six largest funding organizations had thehighest dir ect impact in the published malaria literatur e. Comparing these top six funding bodies, thr ee organizations - USAID, NIAID and the MR C - had a par ticularly high pr oportion of their papers in the top decile. B y definition, it would be expected that these organizations wouldeach hav e only 10 per cent of their papers in the top decile, if their per formance was in line with the world norm. H owever, all had mor e than 20 per cent of their papers in the topdecile.

D ownwar d trends were also exhibited b y NIAID, the TDR Programme and the MR C. An up ward trend was exhibited b y the D oD. The W ellcome Trust's representation in the top decile remained stable. Full details of the 10 most highly cited malaria papers of 1984 and 1989 ar e given in Annex 3. The most highly cited paper of 1984 was sup - ported b y the D oD, the N ational Cancer Institute and NIAID. I n 1989, the most highly cited paper was suppor ted b y the Burroughs W ellcome F und, the FNRS in Switzerland, the N ational I nstitutes of H ealth, Sandoz S tiftung, the W ellcome T rust, and the TDR P rogramme cosponsors. 3.4 SUMMAR Y The bibliometric analysis was based on publi - cation r ecords in the SCI. I t excluded gr ey lit - eratur e published in local or non-E nglish journals. Estimates of the siz e of the gr ey liter - ature are difficult to obtain, but wor k on the science and technology community inThailand has suggested that international jour - nal publications may form only 9-10 per centof that countr y's total scientific literatur e (Anderson, 1991). This v alue is much in line with pr evious calculations that the SCI misses 90 per cent of publications b y scientists in developing countries (S ancho, 1992). Unfortunately , a systematic analysis of outputs in the gr ey literatur e is not possible giv en that it is not included in any compr ehensiv e data - base. The analysis in this chapter ther efore only giv es an insight to publication per for- mance in the international scientific literatur e. The number of malaria publications world - wide was lo w. H owever, their number increased b y 82 per cent o ver the period 1984 to 1994. Compar ed with other fields of bio - medicine, malaria publications accounted for1984 1989Norm 1984 60 5040302010 0% of pa pers top quar tile 90 8070605040302010 0% of pa pers abo ve median Figur e 3.6: The per centa ge of pa pers with fiv e- year citation n umbers gr eater than or equal to the norm citation value f or 1984 and 1989: (a) the top decile , (b) the top quar tile, and (c) the top half of citations.

This figur e can be com - pared with that calculated for car diovascular biology , which contributes 18-19 per cent of the world 's biomedical r esearch (R ogers and Anderson, 1993). The largest pr oducer of malaria papers in the three years studied was the USA, but the tr end in the USA o ver time is do wnwar d. The num - ber of publications b y the UK was str ong on an international basis and the tr end with time was upward. Papers suppor ted b y the W ellcome Trust and the UK MR C were incr easing with time, thus accounting for much of the incr ease in the UK total. These tr ends in output mirr or the tr ends in funding (Chapter 2), thus pr o- viding fur ther confidence in the findings. An av erage of 38 per cent of all UK papers were internationally coauthor ed. International coauthorship was v ery high betw een the UK and the thr ee countries in which the W ellcome Trust and the MR C hav e their units o verseas - Kenya, Thailand and The G ambia. H owever, collaboration was also v ery high with M alawi, Papua N ew Guinea, T anzania and S witzerland - suggesting that additional collaborativ e links exist. G eographical pr oximity with the UK did not appear to be an impor tant factor in deter - mining coauthorship in malaria r esearch. International collaboration in scientific research has been identified mor e as a featur e of tropical medicine r esearch than of other areas of biomedical r esearch (N arin and Whitlo w, 1990). This featur e is suppor ted in the curr ent analysis b y the high coauthorship in malaria, compar ed with car diovascular sci - ence (Anderson et al., 1994). I n malaria, the maximum coauthorship index was 5.0, ascompar ed with 1.6 in car diovascular r esearch. As with the global pattern of outputs, theinternational collaboration pattern in malariaresearch is substantially differ ent fr om that of other r esearch areas.The organizations r eceiving the highest num - ber of ackno wledgements w ere the TDR Programme, follo wed b y the D oD and NIAID. A ckno wledgements w ere also high for the MR C, the W ellcome T rust and USAID. The ackno wledgement data identified sev eral sources of suppor t in the priv ate sector . A rough analysis of the ackno wledged par ticipa - tion in published papers b y the six largest contributors, r elativ e to their financial inv est- ment, was conducted (see F igure 3.7). The analysis was based on papers published in 1994and on funding in 1990. This four-y ear time- lag was selected because of limitations in dataavailability . However, most r esearch is pr obably published two to four y ears after r eceiving fund - ing suppor t (PRISM, unpublished data). Nonetheless, caution is urged in the interpr eta- tion of the r esults because ther e is no dir ect or simple r elationship betw een input and output, especially o ver any delay ed period of time. Furthermor e, no attempt has been made to account for co-funding of r esearch which may vary greatly betw een organizations. Like wise, no account was taken of v ariable o verhead expendi - tures associated with r esearch. These also v ary with countr y and with funding-body type.

The TDR Programme and the W ellcome T rust had the highest number of ackno wledgements per unit of inv estment. These w ere very closely follo wed by the MR C. The D oD and NIAID had fe wer ackno wledgements per million dollars. F inally , the USAID had the fe west ackno wledgements - roughly sev enfold less than TDR and the Wellcome T rust per million dollars inv ested. However, inter esting though these findings ar e, they should not be taken to r epresent gr eater or lower lev els of pr oductivity b y differ ent fund - ingbodies. The costs and natur e of the r esearch suppor ted by differ ent agencies may v ary greatly. Citation analysis r evealed that 1984 and 1989 publications which ackno wledged the suppor t of one or mor e of the six largest contributors were mor e frequently cited than papers which did not ackno wledge these organizations. Indeed, these six funding bodies had on av erage twice the expected per centage of publications in the top decile. NIAID and the MR C had mor e of their papers in the high-impact set (top decile) than otherfunding bodies. These organizations whichhad a high citation impact w ere follo wed closely b y the W ellcome T rust and the D oD, which w ere in turn follo wed b y the TDR Programme and USAID. F or most of these six funding bodies, the pr oportion of their papers in the high-impact set r emained stable o ver time. The ex ception was USAID, which expe - rienced a decline in its pr oportion of high- impact papers o ver time. Based on these analyses, it is evident that the research suppor ted b y each of the six largest contributors has had high citation impactinternationally . However, this analysis is based on only a narr ow interpr etation of the term 'impact '. Publications and citation data can only indicate the influence of a piece of r esearch within the scientific r esearch community; that is, among other r esearchers and malariologists who publish papers. B ibliometric analyses saynothing about the br oader achiev ements of malaria r esearch, its potential impact for improving health car e, or the natur e of barriers to the implementation of r esearch findings. These issues r equir e a mor e qualitativ e approach based on exper t judgements and sys - tematic opinion sur vey. Chapters 5 and 6 report the r esults of attempts to under take such survey wor k. As a pr ecursor to this, it is impor tant also to stress that malaria r esearch is not a homogen- eous activity , and that a number of distinctiv e subfields of inquir y hav e become established over the y ears. U nderstanding tr ends in activity within these subfields is as impor tant as under - standing o verall tr ends in malaria r esearch as a whole, when dev eloping funding strategies. The next chapter , ther efore, reports the r esults from a detailed analysis of inputs to, and outputs fr om, a number of impor tant subfields ve anal ysed r esear ch activity in the field of malaria as a whole , the cur rent cha pter e xamines activity in the main subfields of malaria r esear ch. A classification system was designed f or the division of the o verall field of malaria r esear ch into a series of defined subfields. Bib liometric anal ysis was based on pa pers published o ver a 10-y ear period in 1984, 1989 and 1994. P apers w ere classified into subfields to assess the r elativ e pr oductivity of the different r esear ch ar eas. An anal ysis of the first-author ad dresses ga ve an indication of the g eographical spr ead of r esear ch activity within each malaria subfield and also highlighted the par ticular r esear ch strengths and w eaknesses of individual countries. 4.1 BACKGROUND The databases used for the curr ent analyses were Science Citation I ndex (SCI) and Medline. The M edline database had the dis - tinct adv antage, in the curr ent analysis, of including an abstract summarizing the con - tents of the paper and enabling its classifica - tion into a par ticular subfield. P apers which appear ed only in the SCI database, wher e no abstracts ar e provided, had to be classified b y title alone. As this analysis was r estricted to first-author addr esses, the r esults should be interpr eted bearing in mind international col - laborations. As indicated in the pr evious chap - ter, 38 per cent of all UK malaria papers recovered from the SCI inv olved international collaboration. The use of both databases pr ovided a r obust subfield co verage. As mentioned in Chapter 3, the M edline database has the adv antage of covering a mor e compr ehensiv e set of journals relevant to malaria r esearch, including some published in both local and non-E nglish-lan - guage journals. A comparison of the two data - bases, which was r equir ed as a principal step in the analysis in or der to eliminate any double entries, r evealed cer tain differ ences in the co v- both journals and subfields. Wher eas Medline captur ed significantly mor e papers in the fields of clinical medicine and epidemiol - ogy, the SCI captur ed mor e papers r elating to the chemistr y of antimalarial dr ugs. An input-output assessment of the subfields was made in the context of malaria r esearch funded b y the W ellcome T rust. T o characteriz e the por tfolio of malaria r esearch suppor ted b y the T rust, the subfield classification pr ocedur e was applied to T rust grants awar ded betw een 1984 and 1994 and also to papers ackno wledg - ing T rust suppor t that w ere published in thr ee selected y ears.MALARIA RESEARCH : ANAUDIT 4.2 METHODS 4.2.1 Bibliometric analysis The classification system for malaria r esearch was designed b y the scientific staff of the Wellcome T rust in consultation with the Steering Committee for the study . The o verall field of malaria r esearch was first divided into eight major categories (A-H). These categorieswere then fur ther subdivided into a total of 14 minor subfields (1-14). P articular attention was paid to defining potential ar eas of o verlap betw een subfields. The r esult was a classifica - tion system that consisted of a series of closelydefined subfields that w ere, as far as possible, non-o verlapping. F ull details of the classifica - tion scheme and of the scope of each subfieldare given in Bo x 4.1. Thr oughout the text in this chapter , letters in brackets r efer to r esearch categories (A-H) and numbers in bracketsrefer to subfields (1-14). The sear ch strategy described in Chapter 3 was applied to both the M edline and SCI databases. As befor e, original r esear ch was identified fr om SCI b y selecting thr ee types of publications - ar ticles, notes and r eviews. O n the M edline database, original r esear ch was identified b y selecting fr om one type of publi - cation - ar ticles. Each malaria r esearch publication was classi - fied b y inspection of the title and, wher e poss- ible, on the basis of the information giv en in the M edline abstract. The subfields w ere defined in such a way that the majority of pub - lications could be assigned to one subfieldonly. These publications w ere counted using integer counting. 30However, ther e were inevitably some papers (0.9 per cent of all pub - lications) that spanned mor e than one disci - pline and in this situation, fractional countswere assigned. B iology , biochemistr y and genetics of Plasmodium had the most o verlap between subfields. Each paper was also identified as either ' clini- cal' or ' non-clinical '. For the purpose of thisreview, a br oad definition of clinical was emplo yed such that it included all studies of malaria in humans. F ull details of this defini - tion ar e given in Bo x 4.1. The addr esses of first authors on papers pub - lished in 1994 w ere examined to assess the contributions of differ ent countries to par ticu- lar ar eas of malaria r esearch and to characteriz e national str engths and w eaknesses. Analysis of the addr esses of all authors was not possible because of the limited addr ess information available on M edline r ecords. 4.2.2 Funding analysis Grants awar ded b y the W ellcome T rust betw een 1984 and 1994 in the field of malaria r esearch were classified into the 14 subfields accor ding to the research description on the original grant application. The majority of grants, awar ded for research of 3-5 y ears' duration, had a br oad scientific scope. Consequently , ther e was a ten - dency for grants to span mor e than one subfield. Fractional counts w ere assigned to subfields in this situation and no attempt was made to estimate the emphasis of the grant in differ ent areas of r esearch. The distribution of T rust-suppor ted research across the differ ent subfields of malaria research was calculated on the basis of expendi - ture and on the basis of the number of grants awarded. F or the analysis of expenditur e, data are presented both including and ex cluding suppor t for the o verseas units. R esearch carried out at the units was judged to span a numberof differ ent subfields, but it was not possible to determine accurately the r elativ e subfield emphasis of the r esearch pr ogrammes. H ence, in calculations of expenditur e, the costs associ - ated with o verseas units w ere divided equally between the r elevant subfields. F or the analysis of grant numbers, all awar ds in the form of fellowships, pr oject grants and pr ogramme grants w ere included, but grants to suppor t the Trust's overseas units w ere excluded. 31However, research at the units is r eflected, to a significant extent, in fello wship awar ds to prin cipal 30See f or details on bibliometric techniques. 31Grants to units ar e not directly equivalent to the other a ward types since the y may be f or individual items, such as equipment, ratherthan f or a defined r esear ch programme .

SCI papers ackno w- ledging the W ellcome T rust, and published in 1984, 1989 and 1994 (see Chapter 3) w ere also categoriz ed by subfield. 4.3 RESUL TS 4.3.1 Publication output The number of publications in the field of malaria r etriev ed fr om both the SCI and Medline databases (the ' combined ' SCI/M edline set of papers) incr eased fr om 918 in 1984 to 1302 in 1994 - a 42 per centincrease. O n average, the number of publica - tions identified b y the combined sear ch was substantially gr eater than that identified using SCI alone in Chapter 3. H owever, the incr ease in SCI output o ver the 10-y ear period was 82 per cent, indicating that o ver time an incr eas- ingly large shar e of the combined SCI/M edline malaria papers can be found in SCI alone. The classification system which was designed for the analysis pr oved to be v ery specific. The majority of papers w ere classified into one sub - field only , although 29 papers (0.9 per cent of the total output) w ere consider ed to span mor e than one subfield. The distribution of malariaresearch outputs acr oss the br oad categories of research, A-H, is illustrated in F igure 4.1. A detailed br eakdo wn of the publications into subfields 1-14, and accor ding to the ' clinical 'or 'non-clinical ' natur e of the studies, is pr e- sented in F igure 4.2 and Annex 4. Publications w ere most numer ous in two major categories: clinical tr eatment and patho - physiology of malaria (D), and basic sciencestudies of Plasmodium (C). The categories of drug disco very and dev elopment (A), immunology and v accines (B), mosquito v ec- tor studies (H), and epidemiology and mathe - matical modelling (E) w ere also w ell represented b y publications. O ne br oad cate - gory that appear ed less activ e than the others was that of inter vention trials and health ser - vices r esearch (F). The small number of papers relating to diagnostic tests (G) was not unex - pected in vie w of the limited definition and extent of this categor y. A substantial pr oportion of papers (15 per cent) r elated to the disco very and dev elopment of ne w antimalarial dr ugs in vitr oand in ani - mal models (1, 2). O f these papers, just o ver two-thir ds described studies of the chemical properties or synthesis of antimalarial com - pounds; the activity , toxicity or pharmacology of dr ugs in vitr oor in animal models; or the development of methods to detect antimalarial drugs in blood or urine (1). The r emaining one-thir d of papers explor ed the biochemistr y of antimalarial activity or the mechanisms ofparasite r esistance to dr ugs (2).

Thus, a total of 28 percent of all malaria r esearch outputs r elated to the dev elopment of ne w antimalarial dr ugs, from studies of dr ug chemistr y thr ough to clinical trials in humans (1, 2, 8, 10). Overall, 42 per cent of the malaria r esearch publications w ere classified as ' clinical ', describing studies that inv olved humans. The remaining 58 per cent of publications w ere classified as ' non-clinical ', describing r esearchemplo ying in vitr oor animal models of malaria; basic science studies of Plasmodium or mosquito malaria v ectors; epidemiological studies of mosquitoes; or theor etical studies. In the set immunology and v accine papers (3, 4), appr oximately half of the publications described studies of the human immuneresponse, while the other half described research in animal models or in vitr o. In patho - physiology and disease symptoms (9), about one-thir d of the studies emplo yed animal models, while two-thir ds w ere studies of disease in humans. A bout two-thir ds of epidemiological studies (11) described theprevalence of P lasmodial parasites (including drug-resistant strains) and morbidity and mortality r esulting fr om malaria, while the other thir d concerned the epidemiology of mosquitoes or mathematical modelling ofmalaria transmission dynamics.

The most notable differ ence betw een the two lists is that China and I ndia, and also cer tain other countries such as B razil, South Africa and R ussia, had a higher ranking in the combined SCI/M edline data set, than that determined fr om SCI papers only . This was primarily the r esult of the inclusion within Medline of a gr eater number of national and regional journals and, in par ticular , of I ndian and Chinese medical journals. Of the combined SCI/M edline set of malaria publications (1994), 23 per cent had a first-author addr ess in the USA and 12 per cent in the UK. I n contrast, 37 per cent and 16 per cent of SCI malaria papers (1984, 1989 and1994) had at least one author addr ess in the USA or the UK, r espectiv ely (see T able 3.2). The lo wer per centage shar es of the USA and UK of the combined publications set, com - pared with that of SCI papers alone, was par tly the result of the differ ent methods of analysis emplo yed (i.e. all author addr esses w ere taken into consideration in the SCI data set), butalso r eflected the gr eater r epresentation of local and non-E nglish-language journals in the combined SCI/M edline publications set.The countries of first authors w ere analysed with r espect to the r esearch subfield classifica - tions in 1994. The r esults pr ovided an indica - tion of the geographical spr ead of r esearch activity within each malaria subfield (F igures 4.4 and 4.5). As this analysis was r estricted to first-author addr esses, the r esults should be interpr eted bearing in mind the existence of international collaborations. F or example, 34 per cent of the combined SCI/M edline set of papers with a first-author addr ess in Thailand were found also to include at least one UK author .

Table4.1 Top e link betw een the two coun - tries. I t is wor th recalling that, because of the small number of papers published in the differ - ent disciplines (the maximum was 244 in basicscience studies of Plasmodium ), output may be strongly influenced b y the pr oductivity of indi - vidual r esearch teams. Laborator esearch was pr edominantly located in dev countries and had a r ela- tively narr ow geographical spr ead (F igure 4.4). For example, only 13 countries in total con - tributed to the field of genetics of Plasmodium (7). I n contrast, the geographical spr ead of research was much gr eater for the field-based and clinical disciplines. F or example, in 1994 a total of 52 countries published in the subfieldepidemiology (11), and 57 per cent of those publications w ere from countries outside the top eight publishing countries. The USA dominated all subfields ex cept those r elating to clinical medicine and patho - physiology (8,9,10) in which it fell into sec - ond place. Thailand was the gr eatest publisher in the field of clinical managementof malaria and dr ug trials (8), although about one-thir d of papers with a contact addr ess in Thailand also inv olved a UK collaborator . The UK was the gr eatest-publishing countr y internationally in the subfield concerningpathophysiology and clinical disease symptomsof malaria (9). The UK also published substan - tially in basic science studies of Plasmodium (5, 6, 7 ). India published the second -greatest number of papers in thr ee subfields: epidemi - ology (11), inter vention trials and health services r esear ch (12), and mosquito v ector studies (14). A mor e detailed analysis of the countries most active in the subfields of biology , biochemistr y and genetics of Plasmodium is illustrated in Figure 4.5. The USA was again dominant, although the UK was the second-largest pub - lisher in each subfield. A ustralia and F rance were also impor tant contributors. The geographical analysis also indicated the particular r esearch str engths and w eaknesses of individual countries (F igure 4.6). The first- author publications fr om the USA and Australia w ere biased to wards laborator y- based, basic science studies. F rance and the UK had v ery similar por tfolios, with about 65 per cent of their publications on laborator y- based subfields and the r emainder being devoted to clinical and field-based r esearch. As noted abo ve, the UK had a par ticular str ength in the ar ea of pathophysiology and disease symptoms of malaria (9) and 18 per cent of its1994 publications w ere relevant to this ar ea.

M alaria r esearch at these units had a par ticular focus on the dev elopment of impr oved methods for the clinical manage - ment of malaria, studies of antimalarial dr ug pharmacokinetics, clinical obser vations of ogy (8,9). R esearch pr ogrammes also include epidemiological studies of malaria pr evalence and sev erity and the distribution of mosquito vectors (11), studies of the human immune response to Plasmodium (3), and mosquito contr ol inter vention trials and health ser vices research (12). As it was not possible to deter - mine accurately the pr oportions of unit fund - ing that w ere assigned to the individual subfields of r esearch, expenditur e was divided equally betw een the subfields 3, 8, 9, 11 and 12. It is recogniz ed that this pr ocedur e intr o- duced significant appr oximations into the resulting figur es and calculations w ere ther e- fore carried out both to include and ex clude the costs of o verseas units. I nclusion of unit expenditur e does, ho wever, indicate the signif - icant allocation of funds b y the T rust to field- based malaria r esearch. About one-quar ter of W ellcome T rust suppor t for malaria r esearch betw een 1984 and 1994 was in the ar ea of clinical management and pathophysiology (8, 9) - 28 per cent b y num - ber of grants and 24 per cent b y amount. When the costs of o verseas units w ere included, suppor t in these two ar eas accounted for 30 per cent of expenditur e. Just over one-quar ter of T rust malaria r esearch grants w ere for basic science studies of Plasmodium, and these grants w ere awar ded almost equally betw een the thr ee areas of biol - ogy, biochemistr y and genetics (5,6,7). These subfields of r esearch together accounted for 20 per cent of T rust expenditur e on malaria r esearch fellowships, pr oject grants and pr ogrammeMALARIA RESEARCH 524 SUBFIELDS OF MAL ARIA RESEAR CH grants, but only 14 per cent of total expenditur e. The ar ea of immunology and v elop- ment (3,4) was str ongly r epresented in the portfolio of malaria r esearch funded b y the Trust, accounting for 19 per cent of awar ds, and 25 per cent of the o verall expenditur e on the field. The high expenditur e on this research ar ea reflected a number of major (five-year) awar ds and pr ogramme grants). The r esear ch ar eas of dr ug disco very and development, and biochemistr y of dr ug action (1,2); mosquito v ector studies (14); and epidemiology (11) each accounted for8-9% of all T rust malaria r esear ch awar ds. A proportion of sev eral fello wship awar ds to individuals associated with T rust o verseas units w ere for studies in the subfield of inter - vention trials and health ser vices r esear ch (12). N o suppor t was assigned to r esear ch in the small ar eas of diagnostic test dev elopment (13) or tr eatment and pr ophylaxis of malaria in trav ellers (10). Figure 4.7 compar es the subfield distribution of Trust malaria r esearch grants and total expenditur e betw een 1984 and 1994, with the distribution of SCI papers published in 1984,1989 and 1994 that ackno wledged T rust sup - port. The data clearly demonstrate that the high T rust expenditur e on r esearch into the pathophysiology and clinical disease symp - toms of malaria (9) and the clinical manage - ment of malaria and dr ug trials (8) was reflected in a high output of papers in these areas. Conv ersely , the high expenditur e on the immunology and v accine dev elop- ment (3,4) and on epidemiology (11) was notmirrored by a corr espondingly high output of publications. 4.4 SUMMAR Y Malaria r esearch publications w ere classified into a series of defined subfields. The numbersof papers per subfield giv es some measur e ofthe activity in differ ent r esearch disciplines. However, in drawing conclusions fr om com - parisons of absolute numbers of papers persubfield, it should be borne in mind that theresearch effor t represented b y a single paper varies betw een subfields due to differ ences in experimental appr oaches and techniques. I n addition, the extent of the subfield, which isdetermined b y the definition emplo yed to describe it, will also affect the absolute numberof publications per subfield. F inally , the o verall field of malaria r esearch is r elativ ely small and individual r esearch gr oups may substantially influence output in a par ticular subfield and hence the balance betw een subfields.Categ orySubfield No. No. of grants awarded* A Drug disco very and de velopment 1 5.5 (in vitroand in animal models) B Mechanisms of drug action 2 7.5 Immunolog y and vaccine 3 28.4 development C Biolog y of Plasmodium 5 14.2 Biochemistr y of Plasmodium 6 13.2 Genetics of Plasmodium 7 10.7 D Clinical management of malaria 8 11.6 and drug trials Pathoph ysiolog y and disease 9 28.6 symptoms Malaria in tra vellers and migrants 10 0 E Epidemiolog y 11 12.1 F Intervention trials and health 12 1.3 services r esear ch G Diagnostic tests f or malaria 13 0 H Mosquito v ector studies 14 13.0 Totals *Fellowships, pr oject and pr grants onl y. **Total expenditur e on o verseas units in Thailand, Vietnam and K enya (1984-1994): $15.4 million on subfields 3, 8, 9, 11, and 12.Table 4.2 Wellcome T rust suppor t for the diff OF MAL ARIA RESEAR CH Most of the major scientific categories within the field of malaria r esear ch w ere well repre- sented b y publications in the thr ee years analysed. Each of the follo wing contributed substantially to the total r esear ch output: drug disco very and and v accine dev elopment (3,4); basic science studies of Plasmodium (5,6,7); clinical medicine and pathophysiology(8,9,10); epidemiology and mathematicalmodelling (11); and mosquito v ector studies (14). O ne br oad ar ea that appear ed to be less active was that of inter vention trials and health ser vices r esear ch (12), although it is possible that information r elevant to this sub -field is published in the gr ey literatur e of the malaria-endemic countries. The r esults of the scientific subfield analysis indicated that international malaria r esearch activity was r elativ ely w ell balanced betw een 'clinical ' studies of malaria in man (42 per cent) and ' non-clinical ' studies of malaria in animal or in vitr omodels, and of mosquito vectors of malaria (58 per cent). Analysis of publishing tr ends betw een 1984 and 1994 indicated that the genetics ofPlasmodium (7) and the clinical management of malaria and antimalarial dr ug trials (8) gained an incr eased shar e of the o verall set of malaria r esearch publications at the expense of biology (5) and biochemistr y (6) of Plasmodium andmosquito v ector studies (14). These tr ends may in par t reflect the r ecent increased application of molecular biology techniques to the field of malaria r esearch and the mo ve away fr om mor e traditional method - ology . The incr eased activity in the ar ea of clin - ical management of malaria and antimalarialdrug trials may r eflect the r ecognition of an urgent need to dev elop ne w treatments and to optimiz e use of existing tr eatments for malaria as a r esult of the rise in incidence of anti- malarial dr ug resistance. The USA dominated most of the subfields of malaria r esearch. H owever, Thailand and the UK w ere strongest in two subfields - r espec - tively, clinical management and dr ug trials (8) and pathophysiology and disease symptoms(9). F undamental, laborator y-based studies of the malarial parasite w ere pr edominantly located within E urope, the USA and A ustralia. Activity in clinical and epidemiological sub - fields sho wed a much gr eater geographical spread and a substantial pr oportion of papers were from dev eloping countries. The por tfolio of r esearch suppor ted b y the T rust had a par ticular emphasis on the clinical management of malaria and the Expenditur e (US$ Expenditur e (US$ Categ ory % of million, 1992 base million, 1992 base total e xpenditur e year) e xcluding year) including including o verseas overseas units** overseas units** units** 0.5 0.5 2.6 2.6 6.8 8.6 11.7 25.0 1.3 1.3 2.3 2.3 2.8 2.8 13.7 2.4 5.5 5.1 8.2 0 0 29.4 3.0 6.1 13.1 0.8 3.9 8.3 0 0 0 1.8 1.8 3.8 31.2 46.6laria r esear ch (1984-1994)MALARIA RESEARCH and clinical symptoms of malaria (8,9). This expenditur e was r eflected in a high output of T rust-suppor ted publications, which contributed to the high UK publicationstanding in this subfield. O ne-quar ter of total T rust malaria r esearch expenditur e (1984-1994) was estimated to hav e been allo - cated to studies of the immune r esponse of the vertebrate host to malaria and to the dev elop- ment of antimalarial v accines. H owever, this high expenditur e was not r eflected in a similarly high output of publications in this subfield. A comparison of T rust suppor t for differ ent subfields of malaria r esearch with the output of publications in these subfields can giv e an indi - cation of the effectiv eness of T rust suppor t in individual r esearch ar eas. H owever, caution is warranted in drawing conclusions fr om these data for a number of r easons. F irstly, publica - tions analysed fr om thr ee selected y earsthat may not be completely r epresentativ e of the o verall output of papers ackno wledging Trust suppor t. Secondly , this comparison does not take into consideration the timing of theawarding of grants r elativ e to the publication years analysed. Thir dly, individual ar eas of research differ in their pr oductivity as a r esult of the differing experimental appr oaches and techniques that ar e emplo yed. The classification of r esearch publications into subfields in this chapter has indicated theextent of activity in the differ ent ar eas of research. H owever, this appr oach did not attempt to identify the practical benefits arisingfrom the r esearch, such as ne w or impr oved tools for malaria tr eatment or contr ol. The following chapter pr esents the r esults of a study that aimed at characterizing thebroader outcomes of r esear ch funded b y the Wellcome T rust.MALARIA RESEARCH : AN AUDIT OF INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITY 55International and independent reviewers were selected on the basis of their scientific expertisein the various subfields of malaria research.Each set of papers was sent for review by eitherone or two individuals with relevant expertise.Reviewers were asked to complete a question-naire that concerned the overall set of papers(see Annex 6a). Qualitative written responseson the 13 questionnaires were read andanalysed manually. Reviewers were also asked to complete a ques- tionnaire for each paper (see Annex 6b). Thedata from questionnaires were aggregatedacross subfields and subfield reviewers ( n= 1 or 2) was accountedWELLCOME TRUST PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS 5 The overall aim of this phase of the study was to review the achievements and outcomes of malaria research supported by the Wellcome Trust. The analysis relied onindependent expert opinion, and focused on Trust-funded papers published in threespecific years - 1984, 1989 and 1994. The analysis characterized the advances inknowledge which had arisen from Trust-funded research, and identified broader researchoutcomes such as instances of improving disease prevention or modifying clinicaltreatment. The exercise permitted a retrospective review of research results in the lightof advances made since their publication. The analysis reviewed the scope of outputs from malaria research funded by the Trust - hereafter referred to as the Trust's 'portfolio' of publications. The distribution of theportfolio across 14 subfields of malaria research (see Chapter 4) was identified. Thisinformation can provide an important input both to understanding the consequencesof past research funding strategies, and to developing new policies for the future.However, decisions on future funding also require information on the prospectiveopportunities of research fields and subfields. Consequently, the current analysis soughtto identify research topics with high future potential. Although the analysis focused onresearch supported by the Wellcome Trust, the approach could be used to assess theportfolios of other funding bodies. However, the following points should be noted. Firstly, the assessment was not comprehensive, as only papers from three selected years were examined. While thesepapers clearly reflect the type of results arising from Trust-supported research, they maynot, however, be completely representative of the overall output. Secondly, the papersanalysed in this exercise reflect the lower level of funding provided by the Trust someyears ago and not the recent high level of investment. Thirdly, such an assessmentexercise was inevitably subjective as it relied on the opinions of a small number ofreviewers. Finally, the numbers of papers and of reviewers in each subfield were small,and detailed statistical analysis at the level of the subfield was not possible. 5.1 METHODS Malaria research papers arising from T rust- funded research and retrieved from SCI wereselected for three specific publication years(1984, 1989 and 1994: see Chapter 3) andsubjected to a process of expert review. Of the134 publications acknowledging T rust sup-port, 131 were located and categorized by sub-field (see Chapter 4, Box 4.1 and Figure 4.7).Three subfields [malaria prophylaxis and treat-ment in travellers and migrants (10), interven-tion trials and health services research (12) anddevelopment of diagnostic tests (13)] were notrepresented by any T rust-supported papers.The different subfield sets of papers containedbetween eight and 29 papers.Subfield Publication pr esence of W ellcome T rust-funded resear ch33(1984, 1989 and 1994) Antimalarial drug disco very (1,2) ll Immunolog y and vaccine de velopment (3,4) ll Plasmodium biolog y and biochemistr y (5,6) l l l Plasmodium genetics (7) l Clinical management of malaria patients (8) l l l Pathoph ysiolog y and disease symptoms (9) l l l Epidemiolog y (11) l Mosquito v ectors (14) l MALARIA RESEARCH : ANAUDIT OFINTERNA TIONAL ACTIVITY 565 WELL COME TR UST POR ANAL YSIS for prior to summing the data acr subfields.

The last r esult in particular was noted to hav e since generated considerable r esear ch activity . All of these resear ch findings w ere consider ed to be impor tant both because of their contribution in adv ancing theor y and because of their potential therapeutic applications. Epidemiolo gy of malaria and mathematical modelling (11) The two r eviewers of the papers in this subfield held opposing opinions about the v alidity and hence v alue of a par ticular series of papers; consequently , they disagr eed on the pr opor- tion of the papers (total, n= 8) that sented a substantial adv ance in kno wledge. One reviewer indicated that 75-100 per cent of the papers r epresented a substantial adv ance in understanding, and highlighted a series oftheor etical studies of the transmission dynam - ics of malaria as being par ticularly significant. The other r eviewer consider ed that only 0-25 per cent of the papers r epresented a substantial advance in understanding.

Drug disco very and de velopment (1,2) In the r esearch ar ea of dr ug disco very and development (1,2) topics identified as likely to be of futur e impor tance w ere: studies of the modes of action of antimalarial dr ugs (chlor o- quine, quinine, mefloquine, ar temisin and antifolates) and the mechanisms of parasiteresistance to these dr ugs; and methods of mea - suring ar temisin and its deriv atives in blood and other tissues. Imm unolo gy and vaccine de velopment (3,4) Topics of impor tance identified b y reviewers in this ar ea were parasite antigenic v ariation and its relationship to both humoral and cellular protectiv e immunity , studies aimed at under - standing the impor tance of the fine specificity of the immune r esponse in v accine dev elop- ment, and gdT cells and their r ole in non-spe - cific immunity to malaria. Biolo gy of Plasmodium (5,6) Impor elopments in the biology and biochemistr y (5,6) of Plasmodium were expected fr om r esear ch into host-parasite relationships and pathogenesis, and studies of parasite biology in the mosquito v ector . Specific topics highlighted w ere mechanisms of mer ozoite inv asion and host-cell specificity , adhesion of r to pathogenesis, dev elopmental contr ol mech - anisms and in par ticular gametocyte differ en- tiation, and studies of v ector-parasite interactions with a vie w to identifying v accine candidate antigens.Medium term 41% Long term 24%Very long term 12%Immediately 23% 5.2.4 Target audience f or the r esear ch Reviewers w ere asked to identify which pr o- fessional gr oups would find the r esear ch results of most inter est.

B asic r esear chers w ere believ ed to be the gr oup most likely to hav e an inter est in the r esear ch findings.

Clinical mana gement of malaria patients (8) The use of sodium dichlor oacetate for acid lac - tosis in sev ere malaria, as w ell as other ne w approaches to disease management, w ere specifically identified as topics that should bepursued in the futur e. Mefloquine pr ophylaxis in pr egnancy was indicated as a r esearch ar ea that r equir ed fur ther wor Pathoph ysiolo gy and disease symptoms (9) Impor tant topics in this subfield included epidemiology of malaria morbidity/mor tality in relation to transmission intensity , as w ell as mechanisms, especially genetic, of sev ere disease. Epidemiolo gy and mathematical modelling (11) Future hot topics w ere identified as the infec - tion dynamics betw een parasite and host, the relationship betw een disease patterns and transmission, and clinical inv estigations of dis - ease patterns. Mosquito v ector studies (14) Suggestions for futur e topics in this subfield focused on basic analysis of insecticide r esis- tance to help plan futur e chemically based contr ol pr ogrammes, and fur ther wor k on the use of insecticide-impr egnated bednets. 5.3 SUMMAR Y The analysis of T rust-funded papers pub - lished in the thr ee-year sample indicated that several subfields w ere par ticularly w ell repre-sented in the outputs por tfolio (see F igure 4.7). These included pathophysiology and dis - ease symptoms (9), clinical management ofmalaria (8), and the combined subfields ofPlasmodium biology and biochemistr y (5, 6). Ther e was moderate co verage of dr ug dis- covery and dev elopment (1, 2), as w ell as immunology and v accine dev elopment (3, 4). Three subfields w ere less w ell represented: genetics of Plasmodium (7); epidemiology and mathematical modelling (11); and studies ofmosquito v ectors (14). I n the thr ee years analysed, the T rust had no publications in three subfields: malaria pr ophylaxis and tr eat- ment in trav ellers and migrants (10); inter ven- tion trials and health ser vices r esearch (12); and dev elopment of diagnostic tests (13). The o verall por tfolio was balanced in both advancing kno wledge as w ell as the mor e applied aspects of r esearch, such as those with relevance to clinical tr eatment, disease pr even- tion, and the dev elopment of ne w products. These r esults r eflect the emphasis that the Trust places on suppor ting basic r esear ch related to medicine as w ell as clinical aspects of medicine. The timeframe for the r ealization of the practi - cal benefits of the o verall set of r esearch results was largely consider ed to be within fiv e years of publication of the r esults. This suggests that research, generally , has potential for rapid impact on tr eatment and contr ol of the dis - ease. H owever, anticipating the time to r ealiza - tion is difficult, and the vie ws of exper ts in research may be o veroptimistic. P revious studies have sho wn that the difficulties associated with, and hence time r equir ed in, transferring scientific r esearch results into practice ar e often under estimated (see R obertset al., 1981). Subfield achiev ements or outcomes of T rust- funded r esearch were well characteriz ed by the exper t reviewers. F uture oppor tunities arising from the published wor k were also consider ed by the exper t reviewers who identified a large number of hot topics. A chiev ements andMALARIA RESEARCH : ANAUDIT OFINTERNA TIONAL YSIS oppor tunities included in br oader outcomes: clinical management, tr eatment and pr ophylaxis of malaria and v ector contr ol (Table 5.1). As indicated in T able 5.1 ther e was some o ver- lap of vie ws concerning past achiev ements of Wellcome T rust research and futur e hot topics in malaria. These matches suggest thatalthough significant adv ances hav e been made, ance still r dr very and dev elop- ment (1,2) o verlap was evident in r elation to methods for measuring ar temether and its metabolite, dr ug resistance, and the mode of action in antimalarial dr ugs. I n immunology and v accine dev elopment (3,4) o verlap was evident in r elation to specificity of the immune response and the r ole of T cells. S tudies of merozoite sur face pr oteins and of adhesion mechanisms of infected er ythrocytes w ere common themes in past and futur e plasmodial studies. F unctional studies of parasite genes, and in par ticular genes concerned with dr ug resistance, w ere highlighted in parasite genetics (7). I n the subfield clinical management of malaria patients (8), studies on the use ofmefloquine and dichloracetate w ere consider ed to be both past achiev ements and futur e oppor tunities. G enetic factors influencing dis - ease sev erity w ere recommended as an ar ea of futur e oppor tunity in the subfield pathophysi - ology of disease symptoms (9). The r elation -ship betw een transmission rates and disease manifestation was a topic highlighted as animpor tant achiev ement and futur e oppor tu- also an impor - tant oppor tunity in pathophysiology (9). Mechanisms of r esistance to insecticides w ere quoted in both past achiev ements and futur e prospects for studies on mosquito v ectors (14). A number of ar eas that cut acr oss subfields were highlighted as offering high futur e poten - tial. These included studies on genetics, dr ug resistance, and transmission dynamics in r ela- tion to disease sev erity. Significant oppor tuni- ties for malaria r esearch would appear to exist in these thr ee broad ar eas. This chapter has examined the vie ws of a num - ber of exper ts on malaria papers suppor ted b y the W ellcome T rust and published in thr ee specific y ears. F or a fuller analysis of interna - tional achiev ements in malaria r esearch, as w ell as futur e directions for the field, it is necessar y to sur vey the international malaria community including gr oups who do r esearch, as w ell as those who use the r esults of r esearch. The next chapter discusses such a sur vey. The analyses follow a similar qualitativ e appr oach to those introduced in the curr ent chapter , and focus on identifying the br oader achiev ements of malaria r esearch, its potential impact on health care, and the barriers to the implementation of research findings.MALARIA RESEARCH : AN AUDIT OF INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITY 63ing two postal reminders, 51 per cent of the questionnaires had been completed andreturned, and the survey was closed.Responses were analysed using the softwarepackage SPSS. In some instances, results havebeen analysed according to two professionalgroupings, defined as follows for the purposesof this report: the 'researcher group', com-posed of basic group', consisting mainly ofhealth services but also includ-ing a few industrialists/manufacturers (Table6.1). The profile of the entire set of indiv-iduals contacted for their opinions was composed of 65 per cent researchers and 35 per cent users. Where possible, categories of malaria are referred to in the text by letters (A-H), andsubfields of malaria by numbers (1-14),describing the classification system defined inChapter 4.OPINION SURVEY 6 The aim of the final phase of the study was to survey opinion among a large and diverse group of researchers and users within theinternational malaria community on issues relating to the currentpractice and future direction of malaria research. The communitycanvassed included researchers, clinicians, health services practitionersand advisers, industrialists, administrators and policy makers. Viewswere sought on mechanisms for translating research results intopractice, measures to strengthen the field of malaria research, andpotential future prospects for advancing understanding in malariaresearch. The survey offered an opportunity for respondents to express their experiences and opinions on mechanisms of communication andinformation transfer, and thus suggest how research results may betterinform the prevention, control and treatment of malaria in practice.It also encouraged participants to consider opportunities foradvancement of the field beyond any current constraints of finances orinstitutional affiliation. The analysis was complementary to, butbroader than, the preceding phase of the study, which concentratedonly on the portfolio of the Wellcome Trust. 6.1 METHODS A questionnaire was designed concerning the current practice and future directions ofmalaria research. The questionnaire waspiloted with the Steering Committee for thestudy. Following amendments suggested in thepilot study, the questionnaire (see Annex 7)was distributed by post. The questionnaire was sent to an international group of 224 individuals who work in malaria-related disciplines including research, controlor treatment. The group was identified fromseveral sources: membership of the BritishSociety of Parasitology, contact lists of theLondon School of T ropical Medicine andHygiene and of the T ropical Medicine InterestGroup at the Wellcome T rust, and data gener-ated in the bibliometric stage of the review onprolific authors of malaria publications. Within six weeks of distribution and follow-MALARIA RESEARCH : ANAUDIT OFINTERNA TIONAL TS 6.2.1 Profile of r espondents The majority of r espondents to the sur vey were researchers (F igure 6.1). R esearcher and user gr oups composed appr oximately3678 and 22 per cent of the r espondent pr ofile, r espec - tively, indicating a higher r esponse rate fr om researchers than fr om users (giv en the pr ofes- sional pr ofile of 65 per cent r esearchers and 35 per cent users in the entir e set of individuals who w ere sent the questionnair es). A small number of r espondents indicated that they were industrialists, and a number of individu - als indicated other positions such as malariaecologist, epidemiologist, or health ser vices researcher. Some individuals indicated a com - bination of pr ofessions. Roughly one-half of r espondents wor ked in the univ ersity envir onment (F igure 6.2). The government sector was also w ell represented. A total of only 2 per cent of r espondents indi -cated that they wor ked in non-go vernmental organizations (NGO s), although the par ticipa - tion may hav e been gr eater if some of the 5 per cent of r espondents who wor ked in funding bodies included those in NGO s. Some r espon - dents (3 per cent) indicated a wor kplace other than the pr offered categories, and quoted international health agency and univ ersity field station. A total of 7 per cent of individualsworked in a combination of wor k envir on- ments, and almost thr ee-quar ters of r espon - dents indicated that they w ere inv olved in fieldwor k in a malaria-endemic countr y. Just o ver one-fifth of all r espondents specified that their main inter est was in immunology and vaccine dev elopment (3, 4) (F igure 6.3). A sub - stantial number of r espondents indicated a main interest in the biology of Plasmodium (5) and in intervention trials and health ser vices r esearch (12). A substantial number also identified acombination of the pr offered subfields as their main ar eas of inter est. The subfield concerning the dev elopment of diagnostic tests (13) was an area poorly r epresented b y the sample. H owever, as seen in the subfield analysis (Chapter 4), thesubfield is small internationally . 6.2.2 Transla ting r esear ch results into practice More than two-thir ds of r espondents indicated experience in pr ojects wher e research results were taken up and dev eloped fur ther, with a view to impr oving the tr eatment or contr ol ofResear chers Users Basic scientists Health ser vices practitioners/ advisers Clinical scientists Administrators/policy mak ers Industrialists/man ufactur ers Basic scientist 51% Clinical scientist 18%Health manufacturer 2%Other 4%Combination 9% ar e due to the inability to categ orize certain individuals who indicated a combination ofpositions.Figur e 6.1: Ho w respondents categ orized their pr ofessional positions (% of sur vey respondents)Table 6.1 Composition of r esear cher and user gr oups University 47% categ orized their w orking en vironment (% of sur vey respondents)MALARIA RESEARCH : ANAUDIT OFINTERNA TIONAL ACTIVITY 656 OP INION SUR VEY malaria. A high per centage (74 per cent) of these r espondents w ere researchers, thus sug - gesting the existence of activ e links betw een research and dev elopment. I ndeed, those researchers who cited experience in such pr o- jects r epresented a high per centage (64 per cent) of all the r esearchers in the sur vey. This finding suppor ted the argument that the field is w ell represented b y clinical r esearch (see Chapter 4). Analysis of the r esponses was based on the cat - egories of malaria r esearch (A-H: see Chapter 4), because most r esponses could not be allo - cated to specific subfields. M ost fr equently cited experiences w ere in two categories: anti - malarial dr ug disco very and dev elopment (A) and clinical tr eatment and pathophysiology (D). T ogether , these categories accounted for 37 per cent of all r esponses. These focused on involvement in some stage of the dev elopment and testing of antimalarial dr ugs, in optimiza - tion of tr eatment pr ophylaxis dr ug-dosage regimens, or in impr oving methods for the management of malaria. E xamples included: study of the efficacy of combinations of anti - malarial dr ugs; monitoring the dev elopment of resistance to antimalarials, pharmacokinetic and to xicity ev aluations; studies of in pr egnancy; the dev elopment of non-human primate models for testing of anti - sulphamalarial dr ugs; and trials of sodium dichlor oacetate for the management of lactic acidosis in complicated malaria.Intervention trials and health ser vices r esearch (F) was cited in 25 per cent of r esponses. Examples included: field-testing elopment of standar d malaria tr eatment guidelines based upon local information on parasite dr ug sensi - tivity; design of tr eatment and contr ol pr o- grammes; and advising go vernments and NGO s on the policy implications of r esearch concerning malaria tr eatment and contr ol. Immunology , vaccine dev elopment and v ac- cine trials (B) w ere cited in 18 per cent of responses. E xperiences included: characteriza - tion of potential v accine candidate antigens; development of v accines to induce antimalar - ial cytoto xic T cell r esponses; monitoring human immune r esponse to specific antigens; animal and human v accine trials; and the development of v accine deliv ery systems. Each of the other categories of malaria r esearch were cited much less fr equently (<8 per cent of responses). 6.2.3 Untapped potential of r esear ch results Half of the r espondents indicated that they were awar e of research results which might hav e influenced the tr eatment or contr ol of malaria but which had not been dev eloped fur ther. Again, a high per centage (71 per cent) of these respondents w ere researchers. Those r esearchers who w ere awar e of r esearch results which had not been dev eloped, despite their potential impact, r epresented just under half (44 per cent) of all the r esearchers in the sur vey. Consequently , over half of all r esearchers w ere not awar e of any r esearch results which w ere left unexploited. U sers who w ere awar e of research results which had not been dev eloped, despite their per ceived potential, r epresented almost one-thir d (29 per cent) of all the r espon - dents familiar with examples of unexploitedresearch.

B arriers to the transfer of research results ar e discussed belo w. Many differ ent cases of untapped r esearch results w ere reported and examples ar e listed in Annex 8. A substantial number of the casesreported w ere methods for the management and tr eatment of malaria. A number of exam - ples w ere given of potential antimalarial dr ugs that w ere awaiting fur ther dev elopment, and some r espondents also r eferred to the lack of incentiv es for commer cial inv estment in the development of antimalarial dr ugs and v accines. Several individuals expr essed concern that some research results had been selected for fur ther development or implementation without ade - quate evidence of their effectiv eness or v alue. 6.2.4 Barriers to the tr ansfer of resear ch results into pr actice Respondents identified thr ee groups of barriers limiting the transfer of r esearch results into the treatment and contr ol of malaria. These barriers r elated to: obstacles in the design and organization of r esearch pr ogrammes; issues concerning the ev aluation of r esearch results and the dev elopment of ne w pr oducts; and resour ces in malaria-endemic countries. Barriers r elating to the design and organization of the r esear ch pr ogramme Insufficient orientation to user needs and inadequate standar dization of methods Several issues r egarding the organization of research pr ogrammes w ere highlighted. Insufficient orientation of r esearch pr o- grammes on identified needs or pr oblems was cited b y a number of r espondents. A lo w awareness b y basic scientists of the mecha - nisms and r equir ements for pr oduct dev elop- ment was also cited. R espondents also per ceived a need for incr eased standar dization of tech - niques, r eagents and data analysis methods emplo yed in field trials to ensur e comparability of research results. Recommendations to deal with these barriers included str engthening links betw een malariacontr ol agencies, health wor kers and researchers, as w ell as incr easing interaction between basic scientists and wor kers in clinical and field-based disciplines. M easur es recom - mended for impr oving the dissemination of research results in malaria-endemic countries included: publishing in journals accessible indeveloping countries, inclusion of a 'r ecom - mendations ' section in journal formats, and strengthening I nternet facilities. I ncreased investment in operational r esearch was also recommended to optimiz e implementation of contr ol and tr eatment methods on a large scale and under non-ideal conditions. Barriers r elating to the e valuation and development of the r esults of r esear ch Inadequate mechanisms for ev aluating findings and for dev eloping r esults into practice Respondents cited the need for an effectiv e mechanism for the independent ev aluation of research r esults which hav e potential for impr oving malaria tr eatment and contr ol. They also indicated that the substantial costinvolved in fulfilling r egistration r equir ements was a major inhibitor y factor in the dev elop- ment of ne w products. The lack of incentiv es for commer cial companies to inv est in pr od- ucts to be used in r esour ce-poor countries was highlighted. Respondents r ecommended that go vernments and donors - possibly the WHO - should takea mor e proactiv e role in ev aluating r esearch results and in dev eloping ne w products. This could inv olve establishing consor tia of insti - tutes and with r elevant exper tise in product dev elopment, pr oviding tax incentiv es to companies and tailoring the complex r egula - tory requir ements of dev eloped countries to a registration pr ocedur e mor e appr opriate to developing countries. Another pr oblem identified b y a number of respondents was the limited facilities av ailable for conducting the pr eliminar y stages of v ac- cine trials: only one suitable facility exists inEurope, which is shor tly to close, and v accineMALARIA RESEARCH : ANAUDIT OFINTERNA TIONAL ACTIVITY 676 OP INION SUR VEY developers ar e primarily dependent upon facil - ities in the USA and A ustralia. R espondents recommended that facilities for conducting the pr eliminar y stages of v accine trials be made more readily av ailable. Resour ce in malaria-endemic countries Resour ce limitations malaria-endemic coun - tries cited b y respondents included: insufficient research exper tise; inadequate local policies for usage; inade - quate infrastr uctur e for the implementation of local policy r elating to health ser vices; and gr oss under funding of health ser vices. Measur es to tackle the lack of r esearch exper - tise included gr eater funding of collaborations betw een laboratories in dev eloped countries and malaria-endemic countries, and gr eater exchange of trainees betw een these countries. Increased communication betw een individuals in differ ent malaria-endemic countries was also suggested. Further r ecommendations included incr easing the funding of local health ser vices, and estab - lishing an adequate infrastr uctur e for the implementation of policy decisions r elating to health car e. International leadership in the effectiv e management of ne w and existing tools for malaria tr eatment or contr ol was also consider ed very impor tant, for example b y ensuring the dev elopment of policies for dr ug usage that aim to pr event the fur ther dev elop- ment of dr ug resistance. The potential for the WHO to play a mor e effectiv e role as an inde -pendent adviser in coor dinating, informing and implementing policy decisions was identi - fied b y were analysed on the basis of two gr oupings, r esearchers and users (see T able 6.1 for definitions). The per - centage of r esearchers r eporting r egular com - munication with other r esearchers (81 per cent) was higher than the per centage of users reporting r egular communication with other users (68 per cent) ( Table 6.2). H owever, a higher per centage of users r eported r egular communication with r esearchers (74 per cent), than did r esearchers with users (34 per cent). Overall, these r esults suggest that the majority of respondents (r esearchers plus users) engage in regular communication with others wor k- ing in malaria-r elated disciplines. The ex cep- tion was the lo w per centage of r esearchers who indicated that they had r egular communica - tion with users. The per centage of users r eporting a need for improved communication ( Table 6.3) with other users (54 per cent) was higher than thepercentage of r esearchers r eporting a need for improved communication with other researchers (26 per cent). H owever, a higher percentage of r esearchers r ecogniz ed a need for improved communication with users (43 per cent), than did users r ecogniz e the need for improved communication with r esearchers (29 per cent).

Scientific journals and personal communica - tion w ere consider ed, by all r espondents, to be the most impor tant mechanisms for obtaining information (F igure 6.4a). R esearchers and users r eported br oadly similar pr eferences for obtaining information, although r esearchers gave less impor tance to r eports, Internet and informal mechanisms (television, popularpress and radio). Ther e was less agr eement between researchers and users with r eference to the dissemination of information (F igure 6.4b). Wher eas researchers rated journals as most impor tant, users rated both personal communication and confer ences as most impor tant. Almost half of the total number of r espondents indicated an inv olvement in r esearch net - works. H owever, other formal collaboration was minimal: only one in 10 r espondents indi - cated an inv olvement in collaboration to implement/disseminate r esearch results, and only one in 20 said they had access to policy-making ar enas. 6.2.6 Measur es ranked a multidisciplinar y to r esearch as the most impor tant measur e for str engthening the field of malaria research (F igure 6.5).

The categor y which was cited most fr equently as likely to benefit fr om increased effor t in r esour ces was inter vention trials and health ser vices r esearch (F). This subfield was cited in 23 per cent of r esponses. Attention was drawn to the need for pr omot - ing research into the implementation of con - trol measur es, including consideration of cultural and economic factors. Several other categories w ere also per ceived as under-r esour ced. B asic studies of the parasite (C) w ere cited in 15 per cent of all r esponses. Respondents suggested that a gr eater under - standing of parasite biochemistr y would r eveal parasite-specific pathways or pr ocesses that could be targeted b y chemotherapy . Funding directed to wards obtaining a complete map of the genome of P. falcipar umwas also sup - ported, as w ell as the dev elopment of effectiv e transfection systems for P. falcipar um. Epidemiology (E) was consider ed under- resour ced in 14 per cent of all r esponses. Attention was drawn to the need for v arious studies: on the epidemiology of childhoodmalaria (fr om bir th to the age of fiv e years); the use of immunological tools in applied epi -demiology-entomology studies; and the implementation of impr oved methods for the collection, handling and analysis of statisticalinformation. The categor y immunology , vaccine dev elop- ment and v accine trials (B) was cited in 12 per cent of r esponses. S tudies of the immuno - genicity of v accine candidates in primates was given as an example of a specific ar ea that might benefit fr om gr eater attention.

Prospects in each subfield w ere also examined from the perspectiv e of those who wor k in that subfield.

M ore than two- thirds of r espondents indicated that they had personal experience of pr ojects wher e research results w ere dev eloped for impr ovements in dis - ease pr evention, tr eatment or contr ol. H owever, almost half of the r espondents w ere also awar e of valuable r esearch results which had not been developed. These findings indicate that r esearch in the field of malaria has the potential for hav - ing a dir ect impact on health car e, but that the potential has not been fully exploited. Three gr oups of barriers to the transfer of resear ch results into practice w ere identified. These barriers r elated to: (1) obstacles in the design and organization of r esear ch pr o- grammes, (2) issues concerning the ev alua- tion of r esear ch results and the dev elopment of ne w pr oducts, and (3) r esour ces in malaria-endemic countries. K ey obstacles were insufficient orientation of r esear ch pr o-grammes to practical pr oblems and public needs; inadequate standar dization of field mechanisms to ev al- uate r esear ch results and to dev elop pr oducts to mar ket; and limitations in human capital, infrastr uctur e, and funding in malaria- endemic countries. The identification of these obstacles raises a number of issues of r elevance to international agencies and funding bodies, as w ell as to go v- ernments in malaria-endemic countries. F irstly, specific pr oblems and user needs could be taken into account in the design and suppor t of research pr ogrammes. T o achiev e this aim, encouragement could be giv en, and mechanisms suppor ted, to pr omote activ e and international communication betw een gr oups. I n par ticular , interaction betw een scientists, administrators and policy makers on the one hand, and healthservices practitioners and advisers on the other hand, might be encouraged. Secondly , the need for a mechanism to ev alu- ate research results for their potential uptake into practice offers a unique oppor tunity for an international organization - perhaps theWHO, an NGO or a funding body - orindeed a collaborativ e group, to play an influ - ential r ole in informing, coor dinating and implementing policy . Evaluating the effectiv e- ness of health-car e inter ventions using r eliable systematic r eviews is no w widely r ecogniz ed as useful practice in both planning trials andinforming policy . A pr ecedent for such a mechanism is the Cochrane Collaboration, theinternational networ k for the systematic review of clinical r esearch results in specific health-car e inter ventions (B ero and R ennie, 1995; G arner et al., 1996). Thirdly, the need for establishing mechanisms for the dev elopment of pr oducts offers an oppor tunity for an NGO or funding body to have a pr oactiv e role in an ar ena which is typically the r emit of the priv ate sector or regulator y commissions. Alternativ ely, a con - sortium could be established to include gr oupsFigur e 6.7: P ercenta ge of subfield e xper ts who rated their o wn inter est as ha ving v ery good pr ospects f or advancingunderstanding o ver the ne xt fiv e years n= OFINTERNA VEY with r elevant exper tise such as industr y and government, as w ell as NGO s and funding agencies. Finally , the lack of scientific exper tise in malaria-endemic countries might be addr essed through incr eased training and collaboration with non-endemic countries. The dev elopment of fur ther o verseas units, such as those funded by the W ellcome T rust and the UK MR C, might assist in this pr ocess. F urthermor e, over- seas units hav e a role not only in training, but also in encouraging pr oject design which is r el- ative to needs in malaria-endemic countries, as well as pr oviding a r oute for applying r esearch results to field conditions. The sur vey also identified specific measur es to strengthen the field of malaria r esearch, and subfields with par ticular pr omise or most impor tant measur e to str engthen the field of malaria r esearch was consider ed the use of a multidisciplinar y appr oach to r esearch. The categor y judged to be most likely to bene - fit from gr eater r esearch effor t, impr oved train - ing oppor tunities or an incr eased input of funding was inter vention trials and health ser - vices r esearch. S everal other categories w ere perceived as under-r ced: studies elopment; and antimalarial dr ug development. The allocation of funds to research was r ecommended in these ar eas.The subfields cited most fr equently as having very good pr ospects for adv ancing understand - ing o ver the next fiv e years w ere: genetics of Plasmodium (7) and biology of Plasmodium (5). A high per centage of the individuals who identified their main ar ea of inter est in basic studies of the parasite (5,6,7) also per ceived those subfields as having v ery good pr ospects. Caution is r equir ed in this last interpr etation, however, because of the small number of indi - viduals inv olved. This chapter has sur veyed and analysed the views of the br oad malaria community including researchers and the users of r esearch. Both scien - tific and infrastr uctural issues hav e been dis - cussed. The activ e role of r esearch in the practical treatment and contr ol of malaria has highlighted the impor tance of inv esting in r esearch and pr o- moting health car e which is evidence-based. However, barriers which limit the transfer of research results into practical application hav e also been identified. The r eport has suggested mechanisms to tackle these obstacles, and high - lighted the need for international action. I t has also indicated which subfields ar e viewed by the community as being curr ently under-r esour ced, and which hav e the gr eatest pr ospects for advancing kno wledge o ver the next fiv e years. These findings should be of inter est to all those engaged in the r esearch, tr eatment or contr ol of malaria, and to those organizations which sup - port scientific studies in malaria.MALARIA RESEARCH : AN AUDIT OF INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITY 73currently the USA, although there has been a downward trend in funding from that countryover the past 10 years. Meanwhile, the trend isupward in the UK, and especially at theWellcome T rust where funding effort hasincreased eightfold in the past decade. Research outputs An analysis of worldwide publication activity, identified through scientific papers written ininternational peer-reviewed journals, indicatedthat the total number of malaria publicationsper year is approximately 1000. This figure isvery small compared with other biomedicalfields such as cardiovascular science which hasover 70 000 publications worldwide per year(Anderson et al., 1994). The USA is the single largest contributor to malaria research,although its share of world publications hasbeen decreasing over the past 10 years.Meanwhile, the share of the UK - currentlythe second-largest contributor worldwide - isincreasing. The number of acknowledgementsDISCUSSION AND POLICY ISSUES 7 7.1 POLICY ISSUES FOR MALARIA RESEARCH Funding trends Despite the extent and severity of the condi- tion, as well as the proven value of research forpractical health gain, global expenditure inmalaria research is very low. Total identifi-able worldwide spend was approximatelyUS$84 million in 1993, representing aresearch investment for each malaria-relateddeath of approximately US$42. This figurecompares very poorly with available data indi-cating that research expenditure per death maybe orders of magnitude higher for conditionssuch as cancer, HIV/AIDS or asthma. The funding survey revealed that support for malaria research is principally derived fromgovernments in Europe and the USA, andfrom international bodies. Support fromindustry was difficult to discern, but is likelyto be low. The largest source of funding is Malaria is a major killer which threatens 40 per cent of the world's population and causes between 1.5 and 2.7 million deaths per year.Disease prevalence is increasing and geographical boundaries areextending. The main factors influencing this growing burden aredecreasing efficacy of both antimalarial drugs and insecticides, majorenvironmental developments such as land clearance for mining orfarming, and social disruption such as that caused by war. The current situation demands informed action in disease prevention, treatment and control. Any practical approach to combat disease mustbe underpinned by research which is focused on specific public needsand characterized by excellence. The current study has indicated theimpact which malaria research has had on practical health care.Indeed, more than two-thirds of respondents in an international surveyof the malaria community indicated that they had personal experiencein research that was later developed to improve the prevention,treatment and control of malaria.MALARIA RESEARCH : ANAUDIT OFINTERNA TIONAL ACTIVITY 747 DISCUSSION AND POLICY ISSUES in research publications largely corr esponded with the r elativ e funding lev els of differ ent agencies, as determined thr ough dir ect sur vey of the funding bodies. Citations to the paperssuppor ted b y major funding bodies w ere mor e numer ous than citations to papers ackno w- ledging other organizations. These r esults indi - cate the high scientific impact of r esearch funded b y the major agencies. International r esearch in the field of malaria covers a large number of subfields including both clinical and non-clinical ar eas. The study showed that worldwide r esearch publications are evenly distributed acr oss most subfields. Two categories hav e had the largest shar e of outputs: clinical tr eatment and pathophysiol - ogy; and basic science studies of the malarialparasite. H owever, studies of antimalarial drugs, immunology , epidemiology and mos - quito v ectors w ere also w ell represented b y publications. I ntervention trials and health ser - vices r esearch appear ed less activ e than other subfields. Changes in r esearch emphasis o ver the decade hav e slightly fav oured research on the genetics of Plasmodium , as w ell as the clin - ical management of malaria. M eanwhile, emphasis has shifted away fr om the biology and biochemistr y of Plasmodium , as w ell as mosquito v ector studies. Laborator y-based studies hav e been pr edomi - nantly located in dev eloped countries, wher eas clinical and field-based r esearch has tended to have a br oader geographical spr ead, including many dev eloping countries. The emphasis of research in the UK has been on basic studies of the parasite, as w ell as pathophysiology and disease symptoms of malaria. Futur e oppor tunities The need to focus limited financial r esour ces in all fields of biomedical endeav our, as w ell as the incr easing disease pr evalence of malaria, demand that funding for malaria r esearch be appropriately dir ected to subfields which ancing kno wledge and/or impr oving the quality of health. Expert scientific opinion of the W ellcome Trust por tfolio of papers identified specific research topics of high futur e potential. Also identified w ere sev eral br oader ar eas that cut across a number of malaria subfields. These included genetics, dr ug resistance, and trans - mission dynamics in r elation to malaria sev er- ity. Members of the international malaria community , including r esearchers and the users of r esearch, most fr equently cited two subfields as having v ery good pr ospects for advancing understanding o ver the next fiv e years. These w ere the genetics and biology of Plasmodium . The under-r esour ced subfield which was per ceived most likely to benefit from incr eased r esearch effor t was inter vention trials and health ser vices r esearch. This ar ea was also identified as having a lo w publication output. The analysis suggested that a focus onone of these subfields may encourage r esearch with a high potential impact to pr omote either knowledge or practical healthcar e gains. Barriers to the uptak e of r esear ch results The success and impact of r esearch depends on effectiv e mechanisms to transfer the r esults into practical application. E ffectiv e mecha - nisms to transfer kno wledge into practice ar e requir ed to o vercome the v ery real obstacles which limit or pr event the uptake of r esearch. Indeed, almost one-half of the r espondents in the international community sur vey indicated knowledge of r esearch with potential health- care gains which had not been dev eloped. Three groups of barriers w ere identified. The first gr oup focused on obstacles concerning the resear ch itself . Respondents cited insuffi - cient orientation of r esearch on user needs, as well as inadequate standar dization of methods used in field trials. The second gr oup of barri - ers related to issues concerning the ev aluation and utilization of the r esults of r esear ch. Respondents cited insufficient independent evaluation of r esearch results, as w ell as inade - quate schemes for the dev elopment of r esearch results into pr oducts. The thir d group of bar -MALARIA RESEARCH : ANAUDIT OFINTERNA TIONAL ACTIVITY 757 DISCUSSION AND POLICY ISSUES riers concerned r esour ces in malaria-endemic countries. R espondents cited limitations in both human capital and funding. Tackling the barriers The identification of these barriers raises a number of issues of r elevance to international agencies and funding bodies, as w ell as to go v- ernments in malaria-endemic countries. Theseinclude options to dir ect and manage r esearch funds to best effect, and to ev aluate and develop the r esults of r esearch. Clearly , specific pr oblems and user needs could be taken mor e into account in the orientation of research pr ogrammes. T o achiev e this aim, renewed effor ts could be made to pr omote active communication betw een individuals in ofessional gr oups could be recommended, especially betw een scientists, administrators and policy makers on the onehand, and health ser vices practitioners and advisers on the other . The management of research could be impr oved by several means: further attempts to intr oduce of methods in field trials, incr eased inv estment in operational r esearch, wider dissemination of research results, and gr eater r esearch collabora - tion betw een countries. The need for a mechanism to ev aluate r esearch results for their potential uptake into practice offers a unique oppor tunity for an interna - tional organization - perhaps the WHO, anNGO, a go vernment, funding body or global collaboration networ k - to play an influential role in informing and coor dinating r esearch findings. Ther e is a pr ecedent in some dev el- oped countries which hav e established academic centr es for the systematic r eview of r esearch results bearing on specific health pr oblems. The Cochrane Collaboration is an interna - tional networ k of individuals organiz ed around centr es which pr epare, maintain and disseminate systematic r eviews of the r esults of clinical r esearch - usually of differ ent random -ized contr ol trials of specific health-car e inter - ventions. T echniques such as ' meta-analysis ' and 'sensitivity analysis ' are being dev eloped in an effor t to pr omote evidence-based medicine. The wor k of such centr es and their interna - tional collaborators has helped to guide health-care practice and to plan futur e research. Developing fur ther initiativ es for the system - atic r eview of the r esults of malaria r esearch, prior to their intr oduction in practical health- care settings, could be a v aluable dev elopment. The need to dev elop ne w products based on research findings also offers an oppor tunity for an NGO or funding body to hav e a pr oactiv e role in an ar ena which is typically the r emit of the priv ate sector or the r egulator y commis - sion. Alternately , a consor be with r elevant exper tise such as industr y and go vernment, as w ell as NGO s and funding agencies. In relation to r esour ces, the lack of r esearch exper collaborations and exchange of personnel. The dev elopment of additional o verseas units, such as those funded by the W ellcome T rust and the UK MR C, could fur ther pr omote the dev elopment of local exper tise. play an incr easingly impor tant r ole not only in training, but also in designing pr ojects r elativ e to needs in malaria-endemic countries, as w ell as pr oviding oppor tunities for applying research results to field conditions. H owever, the majority of funding for malaria r esearch is presently inv ested in r esearch teams based in developed countries. The lack of av ailable funding for health-car e ser vices in malaria- endemic countries is a r ecogniz ed pr oblem, but one which is bey ond the scope of this report.MALARIA RESEARCH : ANAUDIT OFINTERNA TIONAL ACTIVITY 767 DISCUSSION AND POLICY ISSUES 7.2 REFLECTIONS ON METHODS USED IN THIS STUD Y This r eport has described a number of quanti - tative and qualitativ e methods used to pr oduce an evidence-based r eport on the status and futur e options in malaria r esearch. In order to guide similar studies which might be con - ducted in the futur e, a number of general points should be made concerning theapproach and techniques used in this study . Assessing r esear ch inputs and outputs Firstly, the identification of funding bodies was achiev ed thr ough two separate means (Chapters 2 and 3). D irect contact with fund - ing agencies identified thr ough literatur e searches and scientific attach\u00e9s in embassies was time-consuming.However, this appr oach pr ovided detailed information on the funding of malariaresearch, and also allo wed for the confirmation of the data with sour ce organizations once it had been collected, analysed and collated. Theuse of ackno sive appr oach to identifying the full range of sources of suppor t for r esearch. That method had the adv antage of r elativ e rapidity and sim - plicity , but did not pr ovide data on the amount of funding suppor t, nor on its alloca - tion either to differ ent ar eas of r esearch or to geographical r egions. Both dir ect sur vey of funding bodies, and indir ect analysis using funding ackno wledgements in papers, ar e rec- ommended for a full pictur e of the agencies involved in suppor ting r esearch. Publication output analysis (Chapter 3) requir ed the use of commer cially av ailable databases which ar e not designed for biblio - metric analysis, nor for an examination of thefull extent of outputs fr om malaria r esearch. Although two appr opriate science databases exist, the Science Citation I ndex (SCI) and Medline, neither co vers completely the so- called ' grey literatur e' of national or r egional journals, technical memoranda, confer enceproceedings, and non-E nglish-language impor tant consid - eration for the field of malaria, which mainlyaffects dev eloping countries and is of local interest to r esearchers in those countries. The subfield analysis was v ery specific and use - ful for identifying differ ences in the output of publications in differ ent subfields (Chapter 4). However, ther e was an inevitable degr ee of subjectivity associated with the definitions ofthe categories and subfields. F urthermor e, the partial reliance on the M edline database lim - ited the interpr etation of the geographical analysis of national str engths and w eaknesses to publication activity based only on the first-author addr ess of a paper . However, it was felt that for the purposes of subfield analysis, theadvantages of the M edline database in allo wing for a mor e accurate classification of r esearch by subfield (on the basis of the abstract), and agreater co verage of clinical and epidemiologi - cal publications, outw eighed the disadv antage of the limited author-addr ess information. A full analysis of input/output ratios, based on funding and on publications, was notattempted because of a v ariety of factors. Firstly, the time-lag betw een the awar ding of grants and the publication of r esearch results complicates any such r elationship . Secondly , the v ariability betw een esearch effort requir ed to pr oduce r esults, and hence publications, meant that a comparisonbetween subfields might be misleading. Conducting sur veys Lastly , the use of both an exper t review of pub - lished papers (Chapter 5) and an international,community-wide sur vey on futur e directions for scientific endeav our (Chapter 6) pr oved very valuable in identifying past achiev ements and futur e oppor tunities in malaria r esearch. Analyses indicated the impact that r esearch has had on the br oader outcomes of medical inv es- tigation, such as the dev elopment of pr oducts or health-car e practices. This appr oach was complementar to citation analysis whichMALARIA RESEARCH : ANAUDIT OFINTERNA TIONAL ACTIVITY 777 DISCUSSION AND POLICY ISSUES indicates impact specifically in the r esearch arena. The international sur vey also identified barriers to the transfer of r esearch results into practice, and r ecommended schemes to deal with those obstacles. One useful design featur e of the community survey was the inclusion of a large number of professional gr oups. This br eadth limited the likelihood that the findings of the sur vey would reflect the vie ws of any par ticular pr ofessional group, and pr ovided an oppor tunity for less vocal gr oups to be hear d. The pr ocess also raised the awar eness of individual gr oups to the broader issues of malaria r esearch, and identi - fied oppor dinated action betw een gr oups. 7.3 THE CHALLENGE This r eport has been published in an effor t to inform the international malaria community ofthe curr ent status and futur e oppor tunities in the field of malaria r esearch. Although the study was initially intended for the W ellcome T rust alone, it has since become evident that the infor - mation may be of v alue to other organizations which fund, manage or conduct malariaresearch. The W ellcome T rust r ecogniz es its gr owing presence in the field of malaria r esearch. However, the T rust is also conscious of the need for an international, collaborativ e approach to scientific inv estigation and evi - dence-based medicine. The pr essing need and growing challenge to combat malaria is clearly evident. The curr ent study has indicated potential dir ections and effectiv e appr oaches to addr ess the challenge, and calls for a coor di- nated r esponse fr om the international malaria community .MALARIA RESEARCH : ANAUDIT OFINTERNA TIONAL ACTIVITY 78AMRC (1994) The h Char ities handbook 1994-1995 .
