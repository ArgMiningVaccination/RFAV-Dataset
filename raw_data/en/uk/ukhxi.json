Childhood vaccinations have been proven to be safe and effective, and they are a vital part of maintaining public health. Despite this, there are many misconceptions about vaccines that can lead parents to have questions and concerns. Here are some of the most common questions that parents have about vaccination for children: Vaccines are a type of medicine that helps the body fight off infectious diseases. They work by introducing a small amount of a weakened or dead virus or bacteria into the body, which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies to fight the disease. This means that if the person is exposed to the disease in the future, their body will already have the tools it needs to fight it off. Also Read: [New mums!

Many of the diseases that vaccines protect against are highly contagious and can spread quickly, which can cause outbreaks and epidemics. Vaccines not only protect the individual who receives them, but they also protect the community by reducing the spread of infectious diseases. We have two vaccination schedules. One is the National Immunisation schedule in which vaccines which are decided by NITAG (National technical advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation) and is given to every child free of cost. Second one is recommended by Indian Academy of Paediatrics which includes additional vaccines which are needed and are available in country. Always try to get the vaccines as per scheduled time as prescribed by your doctor. However, if you miss the date, you should get your child vaccinated as soon as possible. It is not necessary to restart the entire schedule again. Select Topics of your interest and let us customize your feed. Yes. Most vaccine preventable diseases do not confer long term immunity after an episode of full blown infection. Live vaccines in which weakened organism is injected produces a strong immune response with one dose but in few of these vaccines second dose is needed as many children may not take up the first dose (poor uptake). Killed vaccines mount immunity in phases and every subsequent dose provides more robust immune response compared to previous dose, hence multiple doses are required. All vaccines induce immunity by causing the receivers immune system to react to vaccine. Hence local reactions, fever and systemic symptoms can result after getting vaccinated. Serious side effects are rare, but they can occur. However, the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks of side effects. No, vaccines do not cause [autism](https://www.healthshots.com/mind/mental-health/world-autism-awareness-day-heres-how-to-manage-autism-spectrum-disorder/). This idea originated from a now-debunked study that was published in 1998. Since then, multiple studies have been conducted that have found no link between vaccines and autism. The CDC, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and many other reputable organisations have stated that there is no evidence to support a link between vaccines and autism. A sick child suffering from mild illness can safely be vaccinated. Symptoms of mild illness (like cough, cold, mild fever or mild diarrhoea) are not contraindications. However a child with high grade fever and severe diarrhoea should not be vaccinated during acute phase. No, vaccines do not overload a child's immune system. The immune system is capable of responding to thousands of antigens at once. Vaccines contain a very small amount of antigens compared to what children are exposed to on a daily basis. In fact, a child is exposed to more antigens in one day of normal activity than they are from all the vaccines they receive in their first two years of life. There are many reasons why some people choose not to vaccinate their children. These can include concerns about vaccine safety, religious or philosophical beliefs, or a lack of trust in the medical establishment. However, choosing not to vaccinate can have serious consequences, not only for the unvaccinated child but for the community as a whole. When fewer people are vaccinated, outbreaks of diseases like measles and pertussis (whooping cough) can occur, which can lead to serious illness and even death. "}
