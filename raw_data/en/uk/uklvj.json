To make a natural carpet cleaner using essential oils, mix together \u00bd a cup of baking soda along with 6 drops of lavender oil into a small airtight container, like a mason jar (you may need to increase the amounts depending on the size of the carpet you wish to clean). The baking soda will help to lift any dirt and also acts as a deodorizer as well, working hard to absorb any odours. Place the lid tightly onto the container and shake vigorously to mix. Sprinkle a generous amount of the mixture onto your carpet or rug and leave for 1-2 hours. You can also leave it to work overnight. To remove, vacuum the carpet thoroughly, passing over the area a few times to ensure all the remains are picked up. Disinfectant wipes can easily be made with essential oils and a few ingredients you already have in your homes, such as paper towels and Isopropyl Rubbing Alcohol. We suggest using lemon or clove essential oils for your DIY disinfectant wipes - both provide a fresh clean scent to any surface and their bacteria-killing properties make them great for DIY surface disinfectant wipes for your home and all hard surfaces, such as countertops and tables. Many household floor cleaners contain harmful chemicals, making them not so pet safe and friendly.
