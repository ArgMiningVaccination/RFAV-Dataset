FAQ Frequently Asked Questions Have you seen all those \"reliable\" sources calling homeopathy a pseudoscience and a quackery? Time to learn the truth - there are millions of people who swear by it. They sure can't be all that wrong. Deep healing - addressing the root cause of the disease rather than focusing on symptom suppression. Personalised treatment - person-centred and tailored to your specific set of symptoms. You are a unique individual, not a disease label. Holistic - treating the whole person rather than fragmenting us into body parts. Homeopathy is truly integrated, flexible and adaptable modern medicine. Believing that your body is capable of healing certainly aids the process. However, homeopathy is much more than this. It is used successfully with babies, animals and plants. In many high-quality randomised placebo-controlled studies homeopathy consistently outperforms placebo. Typically, I expect to see improvements within 3 or 4 monthly consultations when dealing with a chronic condition. Remember, homeopathic remedies don't 'fix' you, they act as a catalyst, your own body does the healing. Absolutely. I work with clients from all over the world via a range of video platforms such as Zoom or Skype. Online consultations work so well that even most of my Dublin clients opt for an online appointment. After your online homeopathic consultation, I will email you the prescription, a list of pharmacies in your country and how to take and store your remedy. Online homeopathic treatment is just as effective as face-to-face visits. Eliminating the need to travel makes a huge difference for some, and many people find it easier to relax and open up from the comfort of their own home. I personally love working with a multitude of cultures and nationalities, my practice never gets boring. Wherever in the world you are, if you want to work with a professional homeopath, I'm just a video call away. "}
