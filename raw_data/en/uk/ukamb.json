One such strategy utilized to subvert host cell apoptosis is the application of molecular mimicry to produce structural, functional and sequence homologues of cellular pro-survival proteins including B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family proteins [ [3](javascript:;)]. Viral Bcl-2 proteins obstruct premature host cell death and are critical for successful infection and proliferation [ [4](javascript:;)]. Bcl-2 family proteins are key regulators of intrinsic or mitochondria-mediated apoptosis [ [5](javascript:;)] and typically contain one or more conserved sequence motifs referred to as Bcl-2 homology (BH) motifs [ [6](javascript:;)], though these are frequently absent from virus-encoded homologues [ [3](javascript:;)]. Bcl-2 family proteins comprise both pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins [ [4](javascript:;)] and the interplay between the two groups governs cellular fate [ [5](javascript:;)]. The cellular pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins [ [7](javascript:;)], which BH motifs in addition to a C-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane region that targets proteins to the mitochondrial outer membrane [ [8](javascript:;)]. Pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins can be sub-divided into two phylogenetically distinct groups, the multi motif pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bak, Bax and Bok or the BH3-only proteins which only have a conserved BH3 motif [ [9](javascript:;)]. The BH3-only proteins include Bik, Bim, Bmf, Hrk, Noxa and Puma. Bax, Bak (or Bok) are critical for intrinsic apoptosis and many hypotheses for the mechanism of Bax-Bak induced apoptosis have been put forth. Two main mechanisms have been proposed: BH3-only protein neutralization of pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins and direct of Bak and Bax [ [10](javascript:;), [11](javascript:;)]. Pro-survival proteins interact with Bcl-2 proteins via their conserved hydrophobic ligand-binding groove to prevent cell death [ [12](javascript:;)]. Bax and Bak activation is crucial for the progression of mitochondrially mediated apoptosis and upon their activation oligomerize [ [13](javascript:;)] at the mitochondrial outer membrane to form pore-like structures [ [14](javascript:;)]. Pore formation at the mitochondrial surface enables the release of cytochrome c to bind the adaptor protein APAF-1 to form the apoptosome [ [15](javascript:;)] that activates the caspase cascade leading to cellular destruction. Key to the neutralization of pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins is the interactions between the BH3 motif of pro-apoptotic proteins and pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins and these have been extensively characterized [ [9](javascript:;)]. The presence of viral Bcl-2 (vBcl-2) homologues prevents Bak and Bax activation and subsequent induction of apoptosis to keep cells alive for viral replication [ [16](javascript:;)]. ORF virus (ORFV) is an epitheliotropic virus belonging to the family of poxviridae, and is considered the prototypical member of the genus parapoxviridae. Other members of the parapoxviridae genus include Bovine papular virus (PCPV) [ [17](javascript:;)]. ORFV primarily infects sheep and goats causing highly contagious skin lesions localized on lips, toes, nostrils and udders [ [18](javascript:;)]. This disease is self-limiting, infected animals clear the infection within 3-4 weeks and develop lifelong immunity against this virus. ORFV also infects humans via handling of infected animals or contaminated equipment and causes skin lesions that last 3-4 weeks [ [18](javascript:;)]. As a large double-stranded DNA virus the ORFV genome is 140 kbp in size and encodes numerous genes including the anti-apoptotic protein ORFV125 [ [19](javascript:;)]. ORFV125 is a 173 residue putative Bcl-2 like protein known to inhibit mitochondrially mediated host cell apoptosis during infection [ [19](javascript:;)]. Sharing relatively little sequence identity with mammalian Bcl-2 proteins ORFV125 lacks obvious BH motifs [ [20](javascript:;)] and immunoprecipitates with the BH3-only proteins Bik, Bim, Puma, Noxa and comprising Bcl-xL, human Bcl-w and Mcl-1 [ [19](javascript:;)]. We now report the structural and biochemical characterization of ORFV125. Our data show that ORFV125 adopts a domain-swapped dimeric structure similar to other poxvirus encoded Bcl-2 homologues and is able to bind BH3 motif peptides from Hrk, Puma, Bak and Bax using the canonical Bcl-2 ligand-binding groove. Our findings establish a structural and mechanistic basis for ORFV125 mediated inhibitor of apoptosis. Experimental (materials and methods) Protein expression and purification Synthetic cDNA encoding for codon-optimized ORFV125 (Uniprot Accession number W6EVU4) lacking the 30 C-terminal residues was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pGex-6p-1 (GenScript) and is subsequently referred to as ORFV125. Recombinant ORFV125 was expressed in C41(DE3) cells in 2YT medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml ampicillin at 37\u00b0C in a shaking incubator until an OD600 of 0.6 was reached. The protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.75 mM for 18 h at 20\u00b0C. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm (JLA 9.1000 rotor, Beckman Coulter Avanti for 20 min and re-suspended in 100 ml lysis buffer A (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT (dithiothreitol) and 1% EmulsiFlex homogenizer and lysed using sonication (programme 7, Model 705 Sonic Dismembrator) and the resultant lysate was transferred into SS34 tubes for further centrifugation 18 000 rpm (JA-25.50 rotor, Beckman Coulter Avanti J-E) for 30 min. The was loaded onto a 5 ml glutathione sepharose 4B column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A. After sample application, the column was washed with 150 ml of buffer A and removal of the GST tag was performed on-column by adding HRV 3C protease overnight at 4\u00b0C. The cleaved protein was eluted using buffer A and concentrated using a centrifugal concentrator with 3 kDa molecular mass cut-off (Amicon\u00ae Ultra 15) to a final volume of 3 ml. Concentrated ORFV125 was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex S200 increase 10/300 column mounted on an \u00c4KTA Pure system (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 5 mM TCEP (Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride). The final sample purity was estimated to be higher than 95% based on SDS-PAGE analysis. Appropriate fractions were pooled and concentrated using a centrifugal concentrator with 3 kDa molecular mass cut-off (Amicon \u00ae Ultra 15) to a final concentration of 6.4 mg/ml. Selenomethionine labelled protein was expressed in minimal media supplemented with 60 mg/l of Selenomethionine as previously described [ [21](javascript:;)] and purified as above. Measurement of dissociation constants Binding affinities were measured using a MicroCal iTC200 system (GE Healthcare) at 25\u00b0C using wild type ORFV125 in 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM TCEP at a final concentration of 60 M. BH3 motif peptide ligands were used at a concentration of 600 M except Bak (800 M) and Puma (700 M) and titrated using 19 injections of 2.0 l of ligand. All affinity measurements were performed in triplicate. Protein concentrations were measured using a Nanodrop UV spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) at a wavelength of 280 nm. Peptide concentrations were calculated based on the dry peptide weight after synthesis. The BH3 motif peptides used were commercially synthesized and were purified to a final purity of 95% (GenScript) and based on the human sequences shown in are the means of three replicates with standard error and 'NB' denotes No binding. Start and end residue as well as complete sequence for each BH3 motif peptide used is shown. Crystallization and structure determination Crystals of apo-ORFV125 were obtained at a protein concentration of 6.0 mg/ml. Crystals for ORFV125: Bax BH3 complex were obtained by mixing ORFV125 with human Bax 28-mer peptide at a 1 : 1.25 molar ratio as described [ [23](javascript:;)] and concentrated using a centrifugal concentrator with 3 kDa molecular mass cut-off (Amicon \u00ae Ultra 0.5) to 6.4 mg/ml. The concentrated protein was immediately used for crystallization trials using commercial sparse matrix screens in 96 well-sitting drop trays (Swissic, Neuheim, Switzerland). ORFV125: Bax BH3 crystals were grown by the sitting drop vapour diffusion method at 20\u00b0C in 0.2 M Magnesium chloride hexahydrate, 0.1 M Bis-Tris pH 5.5, 25% PEG 3350. The crystals were flash cooled at 173\u00b0C in the mother liquor. The ORFV125: Bax BH3 complex formed single rod-shaped crystals belong to space group I2 with a = 69.51 \u00c5, b orthorombic crystal system. All data were collected at the Australian Synchrotron MX2 beamline [ [24](javascript:;)] using an Eiger detector with an oscillation range 0.1\u00b0 per frame with a wavelength of 0.9537 \u00c5. The diffraction data were integrated using XDS [ [25](javascript:;)] and scaled using AIMLESS [ [26](javascript:;)]. Selenomethionine labelled ORFV125: Bax BH3 crystals were obtained in the same crystallization condition as described above for the unlabelled complex. Anomalous diffraction data were collected at the MX1 beamline [ [27](javascript:;)] at the Australian Synchrotron using an Eiger detector with an oscillation range 0.1\u00b0 per frame with a wavelength of 0.97710 \u00c5, integrated using XDS [ [25](javascript:;)], and scaled using Aimless [ [26](javascript:;)]. The structure was phased by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) using Selenium atoms. Five sites were located using Shelx [ [28](javascript:;)] and phased using AutoSol in Phenix [ [29](javascript:;), [30](javascript:;)] with a figure of Merit of 0.30. The initial map was built using Phenix autobuild, and the resultant structure was used for molecular replacement of native ORFV125: Bax using PHASER [ [31](javascript:;)]. ORFV125: Bax two Bax BH3 peptide, with 41.05% solvent content and final TFZ and LLG values of 22.3 and 1276.07, respectively. The final model of ORFV125: Bax BH3 was built manually over several cycles using Coot [ [32](javascript:;)] and refined using PHENIX with final Rwork/Rfree of 23.3/25.9, with 99% of residues in the favoured region of the Ramachandran plot and no outliers. apo-ORFV125 crystals were obtained in 0.2 M Sodium potassium tartrate, 0.1 M Bis-Tris propane pH 6.5, 20% PEG 3350. The crystals were flash cooled at 173\u00b0C in mother liquor supplemented with 20% ethylene glycol. The apo-ORFV125 crystals formed single trigonal bipyramidal crystals belong to space group P6222 with a = 106.25 \u00c5, b the hexagonal crystal system. Diffraction data collection, integration and scaling were performed as described above. Molecular replacement was performed using the Phenix PhaserMR [ [29-31](javascript:;)] pipeline with the previously solved ORFV125: Bax BH3 structure as a search model. apo-ORFV125 crystals contained one molecule of ORFV125 in the asymmetric unit, with 43% solvent content and final TFZ and LLG values of 11.4 and 93.60, respectively. The final model of apo-ORFV125 was built manually over several cycles using Coot [ [32](javascript:;)] and refined using PHENIX [ [29](javascript:;), [30](javascript:;)] with final Rwork/Rfree of 24.4/26.0, with 99% of residues in the favoured region of the Ramachandran plot and no outliers. All images for apo-ORFV125 and ORFV125: Bax BH3 complexes were generated using PyMOL molecular graphic system version 1.8.6.0 (Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC, New York, U.S.A.). All software were accessed through the SBGrid suite [ [33](javascript:;)]. Co-ordinate files have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the accession code [7ADS](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7ADS) and [7ADT](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7ADT). All raw diffraction images were deposited on the SBGrid Data Bank using their PDB accession numbers [ [34](javascript:;)]. Analytical size-exclusion chromatography 3.2/300 column equilibrated in 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 5 mM TCEP as described above. The column was calibrated using three protein molecular mass markers (1 mg ml1 Albumin (66 kDa), 2 mg ml1 cytochrome c (12 kDa)) (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in the same buffer as ORFV125. ORFV125 at a concentration of 3.0 mg ml1 was then injected, and all elution profiles of the chromatograms were recorded. Sequence alignment Sequence alignments were performed using MUSCLE [ [35](javascript:;)] ( [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/muscle/](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/muscle/)) with the default settings. Results ORFV125 was identified as a putative Bcl-2 homologue via database searches by its sequence similarity to other poxvirus encoded Bcl-2 proteins such as VACV F1L (9.7% ( [Figure 1](javascript:;)) [ [19](javascript:;)]. It was previously reported that ORFV125 localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane using its C-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane region and was able to inhibit mitochondrially mediated apoptosis at multiple points in the signalling pathway [ [19](javascript:;), [20](javascript:;)]. However, the interactions of ORFV125 with host pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and the structural basis of apoptosis inhibition remained to be clarified. To understand the molecular and structural basis of apoptosis inhibition by ORFV125, we systematically investigated the structure and ability of recombinantly expressed and purified ORFV125 to bind to peptides spanning the BH3 motif region of human pro-apoptotic selective pro-apoptotic BH3 motif peptides, bound Bax BH3 (682 nM) with modest affinity and significant affinities were detected for all other tested BH3 motif peptides including the previously reported interactors Bim and Bik [ [20](javascript:;)], or for the autophagy regulator Beclin-1. Sequence alignment with pro-survival Bcl-2 members. [Close modal](javascript:;) ORFV125 motif peptides of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. [Close modal](javascript:;) To the structural basis of ORFV125 modulated inhibition of apoptosis we determined the crystal structures of apo-ORFV125 and its complex bound to its highest only modest sequence identity with its cellular counterparts, ORFV125 adopts the conserved Bcl-2 The crystal structure of apo-ORFV125 revealed a domain-swapped dimeric configuration that has been observed dimer, the 1 helix of one protomer is swapped with the 1 helix of the neighbouring protomer ( [Figure 3a](javascript:;)). To compare the differences between a single chain of ORFV125 and dimeric ORFV125 with C backbone with that of ORFV125. This yielded rmsd values of 1.0 \u00c5 over 35 C atoms, 1.2 \u00c5 over 37 C atoms, 2.6 \u00c5 over 103 C atoms, 2.6 \u00c5 over 124 C atoms for a single protomer of ORFV, respectively, and rmsd values of 1.1 \u00c5 over 70 C atoms, 1.2 \u00c5 over 74 C atoms, 2.6 \u00c5 over 206 C atoms and 2.7 \u00c5 over 248 C atoms for the dimeric configuration of ORFV125, respectively. Cartoon representation of apo-ORFV125 and ORFV125 bound to Bax BH3 domain parentheses are for the highest resolution shell. The crystal structure of the ORFV125: Bax BH3 complex revealed that binding of the Bax peptide to ORFV125 occurs binding is mediated a combination of ionic interactions, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Like other BH3-Bcl-2 interactions five hydrophobic five hydrophobic pockets of the ORFV125 binding groove. In addition to the conserved hydrophobic interactions ionic interactions are ionic interactions are supplemented by hydrogen bonding interaction between the main chain amide of ORFV125 G87 upon binding to Bax BH3 peptide we superimposed the backbones of the ORFV125: Bax BH3 complex. Upon Bax binding ORFV125 undergoes a conformational transformation where the C-terminal end of helix 3 is moving by 13.4 \u00c5 ( [Figure 4c](javascript:;)) relative to its equivalent position in apo-ORFV. This is accompanied by a pivoting of the entire 3 helix allowing the 3 and 2 helices to form a contiguous 2 helix. In contrast, interactions of cellular Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 with Bax BH3 result in much smaller binding groove rearrangements, with observed shifts of the 3 helix by 7.3 \u00c5, 8.3 \u00c5 and 3.3 \u00c5, respectively. Notably, the regions corresponding to 3 of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL or Mcl-1 in the ligand-free structures are largely unstructured, and adopt a more ordered helical structure upon ligand binding. apo-ORFV125, on the other hand features a fully ordered 3 helix that merges with 2 after Bax displays BH3 binding ( [Figure 4d](javascript:;)) [ [40](javascript:;), [41](javascript:;)]. However, these structural changes centre on helix 4, which in this case rotates outwards to enlarge the binding groove. Amongst the poxviridae, only structures of myxomavirus M11L have been determined in both ligand-free and ligand-bound states. In contrast with ORFV125, structural changes upon ligand binding are minimal, with a 1.0 \u00c5 rmsd difference across the entire protein ( [Figure 4e](javascript:;)) [ [42](javascript:;)] when comparing the apo and holo forms of ORFV125. Detailed view of ORFV125 interactions with Bax BH3. [Close modal](javascript:;) To further validate performed analytical size-exclusion chromatography ( [Figure 5](javascript:;)) and compared recombinant ORFV125 with known molecular mass protein standards. Our results showed that ORFV125 eluted as a single peak in volume corresponding with dimeric assembly, supporting the dimeric structure of ORFV125 observed in our crystals. ORFV125 is a dimer in solution. [Close modal](javascript:;) Analysis of interactions between pro-survival and the BH3-peptides of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins revealed that the conserved 'NWGR' sequence motif of BH1 region at the N-terminal end of the 5 helix ( [Figure 1](javascript:;)) plays a pivotal role in the recognition of BH3-only proteins [ [43](javascript:;)]. However, this conserved 'NWGR' motif is replaced by a 'SPGR' in the ORFV125 sequence but the key Gly and residues ( [Figure 1](javascript:;)). (R87) an ionic interaction with the highly conserved Asp (D68) residue of the Bax BH3 motif peptide and forms the hallmark interaction seen between mammalian pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins and BH3 motifs of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins [ [43](javascript:;)]. The observation that despite the substitution of residues in the NWGR BH1 motif the Arg residue is still involved in a key ionic interaction mirrors observations from tanapox TANV16L [ [38](javascript:;)] and sheeppox SPPV14 [ [44](javascript:;)], where different Arg residues mimic the hallmark of ionic interactions observed in cellular Bcl-2 proteins and BH3 motif peptides of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins [ [4](javascript:;)]. Discussion Apoptosis is a powerful defence mechanism utilized by higher organisms against invading pathogens such as viruses [ [45](javascript:;)]. However, viruses have evolved sophisticated strategies to hijack host cell suicide mechanisms to secure successful infection, subsequent replication and survival [ [3](javascript:;), [46](javascript:;)]. Several large DNA viruses encode Bcl-2 like genes that are vital virulence factors during early stage viral infections to counteract the host intrinsic apoptotic pathway and prevent premature host cell death [ [3](javascript:;)]. ORFVs have been shown to bear many genes that interfere with host cell immune modulation but only a single gene ORF125 that directly inhibits the apoptotic response [ [20](javascript:;), [47](javascript:;)]. Remarkably, these viral Bcl-2 proteins may be highly sequence divergent from their host counterpart Bcl-2 homologues with no obvious shared sequence identity, including the BH motifs. Nevertheless, the common feature of these viral Bcl-2 proteins is that they resemble their mammalian counterparts by adopting the conserved -helical Bcl-2 fold [ [40](javascript:;), [42](javascript:;), [44](javascript:;), ORFV125: BIRC5, GTF3C6 and SERBP1, but no follow-up binding experiments were performed on the purified protein [ [53](javascript:;)]. In the present study, we report that ORFV125 interacts with a restricted subset of BH3 motif peptides from pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins Bak, Puma and Hrk ( [Table 1](javascript:;)). The observed affinities are in the low nanomolar and micromolar range, unlike affinities measured for cellular pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins [ [54](javascript:;)]. However, other domain-swapped viral Bcl-2 proteins [ [36-39](javascript:;)] bind their interactors with comparable affinities to those seen for ORFV125. Intriguingly, ORFV125 did not bind the BH3 motif of Bim, a BH3-only protein considered the universal interactor for all previously reported cellular or viral pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins [ [55](javascript:;)] except VARV F1L [ [37](javascript:;)]. In contrast, previously reported evidence of BH3 interactions of ORFV125 by immunoprecipitation experiments showed that ORFV125 interacted with cellular Bim and Bik in addition to Bax, Puma and Hrk, but not with Bak [ [20](javascript:;)]. Considering the impact of detergents on immunoprecipitation results [ [56](javascript:;)] as well as the structure of Bcl-2 family proteins [ [13](javascript:;)] the observation of differences between reported immunoprecipitation results and our affinity measurements are not entirely unexpected. Previously reported immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with full-length proteins transiently expressed in 293EBNA cells, whereas experiments reported here determined the binding of peptides spanning only the BH3 motif region of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, which has been shown to recapitulate interactions between mammalian pro-survival and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein [ [54](javascript:;)] and is often in good agreement with immunoprecipitation results [ [40](javascript:;), [42](javascript:;), [57](javascript:;)]. With certain cellular and viral Bcl-2 proteins [ [59](javascript:;), [60](javascript:;)] reported to modulate autophagy via their ability to bind Beclin-1, we also examined if ORFV125 harboured Beclin-1 affinity. However, no binding to Beclin-1 BH3 was observed, suggesting that ORFV125 does not feature broader cell death inhibitory activity beyond the intrinsic apoptosis pathway as seen in other pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins such as Bcl-xL or A179L. To investigate the structural basis for this restricted binding profile of ORFV125, we determined the crystal structures of ORFV125 on its own and in complex with highest affinity ligand, Bax BH3 motif peptide. Our Bcl-2 configuration in solution exists only in a domain-swapped dimeric topology and we were unable to detect any other oligomeric state ( [Figure 5](javascript:;)). This may suggest that the 1 helical component of ORFV125 is less flexible compared with that in TANV16L and thus not readily able to change position. Superimposition of the ORFV125 domain-swapped dimer with previously observed from other poxviruses Bcl-2 proteins yields low rmsd values of less than 1.6 \u00c5 whilst TANV16L yields an rmsd of 3.3 \u00c5, due to small variations in the length of helices and their overall arrangement. This may suggest that the arrangement of secondary structure elements is highly conserved among domain-swapped vBcl-2 proteins from the different poxviruses and that formation of these dimers may not allow for significant levels of variation to its fold. Despite having a near-identical domain-swapped dimeric fold poxvirus encoded Bcl-2 proteins there are differences in their BH3 binding profiles ( [Figure 6](javascript:;)). Compared with Bcl-2 proteins show highly specific BH3 motif interactions and often bind only a few BH3 motif peptides with lower affinities. For instance, VACV F1L is only able to bind to Bim (KD = 250 nM), Bak (KD = and replaces Mcl-1 and neutralizes Bim [ [36](javascript:;)]. In nM) and but not to ( [Figure [ [37](javascript:;)], and functionally [37](javascript:;)]. Similar to VACV F1L, DPV022 Bak regulated apoptosis [ [63](javascript:;)]. While TANV16L displayed a broad spectrum of BH3 interactions compared with other domain-swapped dimeric poxvirus encoded Bcl-2 proteins and binds to almost all pro-apoptotic BH3 motif peptides except those of Noxa and Bok [ [38](javascript:;)]. When considering the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 interaction profile of ORFV125, the inability to bind Bim is striking, with ORFV125 only the second pro-survival Bcl-2 protein to not engage Bim, as is the inability to bind Noxa. Previous reports revealed that Bim and Noxa are up-regulated in human cells during ORFV infection [ [64](javascript:;)] and Bak is up-regulated in sheep [ [65](javascript:;)] and goat cells [ [66](javascript:;)]. Furthermore, ORFV125 prevented both Bak and Bax induced apoptosis after UV irradiation. Altogether, this raises the possibility that it is primarily the ability to engage Bak and Bax that defines the pro-survival activity of ORFV125. Comparison of the BH3 motif peptide binding profile of homologues from other poxviruses. [Close modal](javascript:;) A comparison of previously predicted molecular contacts based on a suggested model for ORF125 [ [19](javascript:;)] with our experimentally observed structures ( [Figure 4a](javascript:;)) revealed substantial differences. The predicted structure for ORFV125 was based on a monomeric Bcl-2 fold, whereas in our hands ORFV125 exists as a dimer in solution as well as in crystallo. At the level of detailed interactions, S43, V47, L51, L55, V89, T90 and L94 were predicted to be involved in forming hydrophobic pockets. Our structures revealed that in G86, M98, L101, to the formation of hydrophobic pockets in the binding groove. The conserved ionic interaction between D99Bim and R87ORFV125 and the hydrogen bond interaction between N102Bim and G86ORFV125 were predicted [ [19](javascript:;)] and matched our crystal structure, whereas the additional salt bridge interaction between ORFV125 E80 and Bax K64 was not predicted. These findings indicate that the proposed structure of Westphal et al. [ [19](javascript:;)] was of high quality in terms of predicting key conserved interactions, but failed to predict the domain-swap structure of homodimeric ORFV125. In summary, we show that ORFV125 is a dimeric Bcl-2 protein with domain-swapped topology that is able to bind important host pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members and potentially interfere with host cell apoptosis signalling in infected cells. Our findings provide a structural basis for dissecting the role of ORFV125 in ORFV infection and to define the contribution that suppression of Bcl-2 mediated apoptosis makes to the orf virus life cycle. Such insights may be significant in the context of understanding the mechanism of ORFV125 regulation of apoptosis. Attenuated Orf viruses have been suggested as potential vectors for vaccine delivery as the virus only gives a short-lived immune response [ [67](javascript:;), [68](javascript:;)]. Consequently, understanding how orf immunomodulatory genes interact with human genes at a molecular level will aid in the design of safe and effective recombinant vector for orf virus-based vaccines.
