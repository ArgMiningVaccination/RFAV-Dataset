In this beautifully illustrated book, he presents the healing properties of 40 essential oils. The author relates the dynamics of aromatherapy to traditional Chinese medicine, astrology, and acupuncture. There are chapters on oils that regulate and relax, settle the mind, boost morale, help one achieve clarity, uplift the spirit, and enhance love. Mojay begins with a look at the different methods of applying these oils including massage, ointments and creams, bath, and vaporization. He goes on to provide helpful overviews of the therapeutic properties of each oil. For example, benzoin is recommended for those who are going on a spiritual journey as it helps steady and focus the mind for meditation, contemplation, and prayer. Caraway and cedar are ideal for restoring a sense of spiritual certainty. Those in need of inspiration and insight can turn to peppermint, clary sage, or laurel. Jasmine is just right for anyone working on a creative project. Rosemary is an ideal oil to use for rituals of remembrance, and sandalwood provides a fine accompaniment to meditation, prayer, and spiritual practice. Aromatherapy for Healing the Spirit is an excellent resource for anyone interested in expanding his or her devotional life through the senses. "}
