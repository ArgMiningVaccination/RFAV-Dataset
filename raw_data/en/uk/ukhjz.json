[Central Asia](/wiki/Central_Asia) and northeastern [Iran](/wiki/Iran) and has long been used as a seasoning worldwide, with a history of several thousand years of human consumption and use. [[4]](#cite_note-kew-4) [[5]](#cite_note-5) It was known to [ancient Egyptians](/wiki/Ancient_Egypt) and has been used as both a food and a [traditional medicine](/wiki/Traditional_medicine). [[6]](#cite_note-drugs-6) [[7]](#cite_note-nih-7) [edit](/w/index.php?title=Garlic&action=edit\u00a7ion=1)] The word sativum a perennial flowering plant that grows from a [bulb](/wiki/Bulb). It has a tall, erect flowering stem that grows up to 1 m (3 ft). The leaf blade is flat, linear, solid, and approximately 1.25-2.5 cm (0.5-1.0 in) wide, with an acute apex. The plant may produce pink to purple flowers from July to September in the Northern Hemisphere. The bulb has a strong odor and is typically made up of 10 to 20 cloves. The cloves close to the center are symmetrical, and those surrounding the center can be asymmetrical. Each clove is enclosed in an inner sheathing leaf surrounded by layers of outer sheathing leaves. [[6]](#cite_note-drugs-6) If garlic is planted at the proper time and depth, it can be grown as far north as Alaska. [[10]](#cite_note-10) It produces [hermaphroditic](/wiki/Hermaphrodite) flowers. It is [pollinated](/wiki/Pollination) by bees, butterflies, moths, and other insects. [[11]](#cite_note-11) Origin and major types[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Garlic&action=edit\u00a7ion=3)] Identification of the wild progenitor of common garlic is difficult due to the sterility of its many [cultivars](/wiki/Cultivars), which limits the ability to [cross test](/wiki/Test_cross) with wild relatives.[ [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] [[a]](#cite_note-14) Genetically and morphologically, garlic is most similar to the wild species [Allium longicuspis](/wiki/Allium_longicuspis), which grows in central and southwestern Asia. [[14]](#cite_note-Zohary-15) [[15]](#cite_note-SFNA-16) [[16]](#cite_note-17) However, because Allium longicuspis is also mostly sterile, it is doubtful that it is the ancestor of Allium sativum. [[14]](#cite_note-Zohary-15) Other candidates that have tuncelianum](/wiki/Allium_tuncelianum), [Allium macrochaetum](/w/index.php?title=Allium_macrochaetum&action=edit&redlink=1), and [Allium truncatum](/wiki/Allium_truncatum), the [Middle East](/wiki/Middle_East). [[14]](#cite_note-Zohary-15) Allium sativum grows in the wild in it has become [naturalized](/wiki/Naturalisation_(biology)). The \"wild garlic\", \"crow garlic\", and \" [Allium actually a wild leek ampeloprasum](/wiki/Allium_ampeloprasum)) and not a true garlic. [Single clove](/wiki/Solo_garlic) garlic (also called pearl or solo garlic) originated in the [Yunnan](/wiki/Yunnan) province of China. Garlic as a geographical indication[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Garlic&action=edit\u00a7ion=4)] Some garlics have [protected status](/wiki/Protected_Geographical_Status) in There are two subspecies of A. sativum, [[19]](#cite_note-GRIN-20) ten major groups of varieties, and hundreds of varieties, or cultivars. - A. sativum var. ophioscorodon (Link) D\u00f6ll, called Ophioscorodon or hardneck garlic, includes porcelain garlics, rocambole garlic, and purple stripe garlics. It is sometimes considered to be a separate species, Allium ophioscorodon G.Don. - A. sativum var. sativum, or softneck garlic, includes artichoke garlic, silverskin garlic, and creole garlic. There are at least 120 cultivars originating from [Central Asia](/wiki/Central_Asia), making it the main center of garlic biodiversity. [[20]](#cite_note-21) Cultivation[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Garlic&action=edit\u00a7ion=6)] Garlic is easy to grow and can be grown year-round in mild climates. [[21]](#cite_note-rhs-22) While sexual propagation of garlic is possible, nearly all of the garlic in cultivation is propagated [asexually](/wiki/Asexual_reproduction) by planting individual cloves in the ground. [[15]](#cite_note-SFNA-16) In colder climates, cloves are best planted about six weeks before the soil freezes. The goal is to have the bulbs produce only roots and no shoots above the ground. [[22]](#cite_note-23) Harvest is in late spring or early summer. Garlic plants can be grown closely together, leaving enough space for the [bulbs](/wiki/Bulb) to mature, and are easily grown in containers of sufficient depth. Garlic does well in loose, dry, well-drained soils in sunny locations, and is hardy throughout [USDA climate zones](/wiki/USDA_climate_zones) 4-9. When selecting garlic for planting, it is important to pick large bulbs from which to separate cloves. Large cloves, along with proper spacing in the planting bed, will also increase bulb size. Garlic plants prefer to grow in a soil with a high [organic material](/wiki/Organic_material) content, but are capable of growing in a wide range of soil conditions and [pH](/wiki/PH) levels. [[15]](#cite_note-SFNA-16) There are different varieties of garlic, most notably split into the subspecies of hardneck garlic and softneck garlic. [[21]](#cite_note-rhs-22) The [latitude](/wiki/Latitude) where the garlic is grown affects the choice of type, as garlic can be day-length sensitive. Hardneck garlic is generally grown in cooler climates and produces relatively large cloves, whereas softneck garlic is generally grown closer to the equator and produces small, tightly packed cloves. [[21]](#cite_note-rhs-22) Garlic [scapes](/wiki/Scape_(botany)) are removed to focus all the garlic's energy into bulb growth. The scapes can be eaten raw or cooked. [[23]](#cite_note-cult-24) [[24]](#cite_note-scapes-25) Diseases[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Garlic&action=edit\u00a7ion=7)] Garlic plants are usually hardy and not affected by many pests or diseases. Garlic plants are said to repel [rabbits](/wiki/Rabbits) and [moles](/wiki/Mole_(animal)). [[3]](#cite_note-AN-3) The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) conducts a certification program to assure freedom from [nematode](/wiki/Nematode) and white rot disease caused by [Stromatinia cepivora](/wiki/Stromatinia_cepivora), two pathogens that can both destroy a crop and remain in the soil indefinitely once introduced. [[15]](#cite_note-SFNA-16) Garlic may also suffer from [pink root](/wiki/Pyrenochaeta_terrestris), a typically non-fatal disease that stunts the roots and turns them pink or red; [[25]](#cite_note-26) or [leek rust](/wiki/Puccinia_porri), which usually appears as bright orange spots. [[21]](#cite_note-rhs-22) The larvae of the [leek moth](/wiki/Leek_moth) attack garlic by mining into the leaves or bulbs. [[26]](#cite_note-27) [Botrytis](/wiki/Botrytis_(fungus)) neck and bulb rot is a disease [leek](/wiki/Leek) and [shallot](/wiki/Shallot). [Botrytis allii](/wiki/Botrytis_allii) and this disease in onion and Botrytis porri causes it in garlic. \"Initial symptoms usually begin at the neck, where affected tissue softens, becomes water-soaked, and turns brown. In a humid atmosphere, a gray and feltlike growth (where spores are produced) appears on rotting scales, and mycelia may develop between scales. Dark-brown-to-black sclerotia (the resting bodies of the pathogen) may eventually develop in the neck or between 2020, world production of garlic was 28 million [tonnes](/wiki/Tonne), with [China](/wiki/China) alone accounting for 74% of the total. [[8]](#cite_note-fao-8) Properties[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Garlic&action=edit\u00a7ion=9)] Fresh or [ajoene](/wiki/Ajoene), diallyl [flavonoids](/wiki/Flavonoid), and [Maillard reaction](/wiki/Maillard_reaction) products when cooked, which are not sulfur-containing compounds. The phytochemicals responsible for the sharp flavor of garlic are produced when the plant's [cells](/wiki/Cell_(biology)) are damaged. When a cell is broken by chopping, chewing, or crushing, enzymes stored in cell [vacuoles](/wiki/Vacuole) trigger the breakdown of several sulfur-containing compounds stored in the cell fluids ( [cytosol](/wiki/Cytosol)). [[28]](#cite_note-29) The resultant compounds are responsible for the sharp or hot taste and strong smell of garlic. Some of the compounds are unstable and continue to react over time. [[29]](#cite_note-McGee,_pp._310-311-30) Among alliums, garlic has by far the highest concentrations of initial reaction products, making garlic much more potent than onion, shallot, or [leeks](/wiki/Leek). [[29]](#cite_note-McGee,_pp._310-311-30) Although many humans enjoy the taste of garlic, these compounds are believed to have evolved as a defensive mechanism, deterring animals such as birds, insects, and worms from eating the plant. [[30]](#cite_note-Macpherson-31) A large number of sulfur compounds contribute to the smell and taste of garlic. Allicin has been found to be the compound most responsible for the \"hot\" sensation of raw garlic. This chemical opens thermo- [transient receptor potential](/wiki/Transient_receptor_potential) channels that are responsible for the burning sense of heat in foods. The process of cooking garlic removes allicin, thus mellowing its spiciness. [[30]](#cite_note-Macpherson-31) Allicin, along with its decomposition products [diallyl disulfide](/wiki/Diallyl_disulfide) and [diallyl trisulfide](/wiki/Diallyl_trisulfide), are major contributors to the characteristic odor of garlic, with other allicin-derived compounds, such as [vinyldithiins](/wiki/Vinyldithiin) and [ajoene](/wiki/Ajoene). [[2]](#cite_note-Block2010-2) Because of its strong odor, garlic is sometimes called the \"stinking rose\". When eaten in quantity, garlic may be strongly evident in the diner's sweat and [garlic breath](/wiki/Garlic_breath) the following day. This is because garlic's strong-smelling sulfur compounds are metabolized, forming allyl methyl sulfide. [Allyl methyl sulfide](/wiki/Allyl_methyl_sulfide) (AMS) cannot be digested and is passed into the [blood](/wiki/Blood). It is carried to the lungs and the skin, where it is excreted. Since digestion takes several hours, and release of AMS several hours more, the effect of eating garlic may be present for a long time. [[2]](#cite_note-Block2010-2) The well-known phenomenon of \"garlic breath\" is allegedly alleviated by eating fresh [parsley](/wiki/Parsley). [[31]](#cite_note-32) The herb is, therefore, included in many garlic recipes, such as [pistou](/wiki/Pistou), [persillade](/wiki/Persillade), and the garlic butter spread used in [garlic bread](/wiki/Garlic_bread). Abundant sulfur compounds in garlic are also responsible for turning garlic green or blue during pickling and cooking. Under these conditions (i.e., acidity, heat) the sulfur-containing compound [alliin](/wiki/Alliin) reacts with common [amino clusters of carbon-nitrogen rings. [[32]](#cite_note-33) [[33]](#cite_note-34) These rings can be linked together into [polypyrrole](/wiki/Polypyrrole) molecules. Ring structures absorb particular wavelengths of light and thus appear colored. The two-pyrrole molecule looks red, the three-pyrrole molecule looks blue, and the four-pyrrole molecule looks green (like [chlorophyll](/wiki/Chlorophyll), a tetrapyrrole). Like chlorophyll, the pyrrole pigments are safe to eat. [[34]](#cite_note-35) Upon cutting, similar to a color change in [onion](/wiki/Onion) caused by reactions of amino acids with sulfur compounds, [[35]](#cite_note-36) garlic can turn green. [[36]](#cite_note-37) [[37]](#cite_note-38) Because of sulfur compounds circulating in blood, consumed garlic may act as a mosquito repellent, but there is no evidence garlic is effective for this purpose. [[38]](#cite_note-39) - Bulbs (top-setting, grown in lieu of flowers) - Garlic, from The Book of Health, 1898, by Henry Munson Lyman - History[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Garlic&action=edit\u00a7ion=10)] Culinary history[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Garlic&action=edit\u00a7ion=11)] Numerous cuneiform records show that garlic has been cultivated in [Mesopotamia](/wiki/Mesopotamia) for at least 4,000 years. [[14]](#cite_note-Zohary-15) The use of garlic in China and Egypt also dates back thousands of years. [[2]](#cite_note-Block2010-2) [[14]](#cite_note-Zohary-15) Well-preserved garlic was found in the tomb of [Tutankhamun](/wiki/Tutankhamun) (c. 1325 BC). [[14]](#cite_note-Zohary-15) It was consumed by ancient [Greek](/wiki/Ancient_Greece) and [Roman](/wiki/Ancient_Rome) soldiers, sailors, and rural classes ( [Virgil](/wiki/Virgil), Eclogues ii. [Natural History](/wiki/Pliny%27s_Natural_History) xix. 32), by the African peasantry. Garlic was placed by the ancient Greeks on the piles of stones at crossroads, as a supper for [Hecate](/wiki/Hecate) ( [Theophrastus](/wiki/Theophrastus), Characters, The Superstitious Man). [[39]](#cite_note-EB1911-40) Garlic was rare in traditional [English cuisine](/wiki/British_cuisine) (though it is said to have been grown in England before 1548) but has been a common ingredient in Mediterranean Europe. [[40]](#cite_note-:0-41) Translations of the c. 1300 [Assize of Weights and Measures](/wiki/Assize_of_Weights_and_Measures), an English statute generally dated to the 13th century, indicate a passage as dealing with standardized units of garlic production, sale, and taxation\u2014the [hundred](/wiki/Hundred_(unit)) of 15 [ropes](/wiki/Rope_(garlic)) of 15 heads each [[41]](#cite_note-42)\u2014but the Latin version of the text may refer to [herring](/wiki/Herring) rather than garlic. [[42]](#cite_note-tract-43) Folk medicine[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Garlic&action=edit\u00a7ion=12)] Garlic has been used for traditional medicine in diverse cultures such as in Egypt, Japan, China, Rome, and Greece. [[6]](#cite_note-drugs-6) [[7]](#cite_note-nih-7) In his [Natural History](/wiki/Natural_History_(Pliny)), [Pliny](/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder) gave a [list of conditions](/wiki/Traditional_medicine) in which garlic was considered beneficial (N.H. xx. 23). [Galen](/wiki/Galen), writing in the second century, eulogized garlic as the \"rustic's theriac\" (cure-all) (see F. Adams' Paulus Aegineta, p. 99). [Alexander Neckam](/wiki/Alexander_Neckam), a writer of the 12th century (see Wright's edition of his works, p. 473, 1863), discussed it as a [palliative](/wiki/Palliative) for the heat of the sun in field labor. In the 17th century, [Thomas Sydenham](/wiki/Thomas_Sydenham) valued it as an application in confluent [smallpox](/wiki/Smallpox), [William Cullen](/wiki/William_Cullen)'s Materia Medica of [[39]](#cite_note-EB1911-40) [[43]](#cite_note-44) Uses[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Garlic&action=edit\u00a7ion=13)] Culinary[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Garlic&action=edit\u00a7ion=14)] Garlic is widely used around the world for its pungent flavor as a seasoning or condiment. The garlic plant's [bulb](/wiki/Bulb) is the most commonly used part of the plant. With the exception of the single clove types, garlic bulbs are normally divided into numerous fleshy sections called cloves. Garlic cloves are used for consumption (raw or cooked) or for medicinal purposes. They have a characteristic [pungent, spicy flavor](/wiki/Piquancy) that mellows and sweetens considerably with cooking. [[44]](#cite_note-45) The distinctive aroma is mainly due to [organosulfur](/wiki/Organosulfur) compounds including [allicin](/wiki/Allicin) present in fresh garlic cloves and [ajoene](/wiki/Ajoene) which forms when they are crushed or chopped. A further metabolite [allyl methyl sulfide](/wiki/Allyl_methyl_sulfide) is responsible for garlic breath. [[45]](#cite_note-Block_1984-46) [[46]](#cite_note-47) [[47]](#cite_note-Block_2010-48) [[48]](#cite_note-ilic-49) Other parts of the garlic plant are also edible. The [leaves](/wiki/Leaves) and [flowers](/wiki/Flowers) ( [bulbils](/wiki/Bulbil)) on the head ( [spathe](/wiki/Spathe)) are sometimes eaten. They are milder in flavor than the bulbs, [[3]](#cite_note-AN-3) and are most often consumed while immature and still tender. Immature garlic is sometimes pulled, rather like a scallion, and sold as \"green garlic\". [[49]](#cite_note-50) When green garlic is allowed to grow past the \"scallion\" stage, but not permitted to fully mature, it may produce a garlic \"round\", a bulb like a boiling onion, but not separated into cloves like a mature bulb. [[50]](#cite_note-51) Green garlic imparts a garlic flavor and aroma in food, minus the spiciness. Green garlic is often chopped and [stir-fried](/wiki/Stir-fried) or cooked in [soup](/wiki/Soup) or [hot and low-priced. Additionally, the immature flower stalks ( [scapes](/wiki/Scape_(botany))) of the hardneck and elephant types are sometimes marketed for uses similar to [asparagus](/wiki/Asparagus) in [stir-fries](/wiki/Stir_frying). [[15]](#cite_note-SFNA-16) Inedible or rarely eaten parts of the garlic plant include the \"skin\" covering each clove and root cluster. The papery, protective layers of \"skin\" over various parts of the plant are generally discarded during preparation for most culinary uses, though in [Korea](/wiki/Korea) immature whole heads are sometimes prepared with the tender skins intact. [[51]](#cite_note-52) The root cluster attached to the [basal plate](/wiki/Bulb) of the bulb is the only part not typically considered palatable in any form. An alternative is to cut the top off the bulb, coat the cloves by dribbling [olive oil](/wiki/Olive_oil) (or other oil-based seasoning) over them, and [roast](/wiki/Roast) them in an oven. Garlic softens and can be extracted from the cloves by squeezing the (root) end of the bulb, or individually by squeezing one end of the clove. In Korea, heads of garlic are heated over the course of several weeks; the resulting product, called [black garlic](/wiki/Black_garlic_(food)), is sweet and syrupy, and is exported to the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Garlic may be applied to different kinds of bread, usually in a medium of butter or oil, to create a variety of classic dishes, such as [garlic bread](/wiki/Garlic_bread), [garlic toast](/wiki/Garlic_toast), [bruschetta](/wiki/Bruschetta), [crostini](/wiki/Crostino), and [canap\u00e9](/wiki/Canap%C3%A9). The flavor varies in intensity and aroma with the different cooking methods. It is often paired with [onion](/wiki/Onion), [tomato](/wiki/Tomato), or [ginger](/wiki/Ginger). Immature scapes are tender and edible. They are also known as \"garlic spears\", \"stems\", or \"tops\". Scapes generally have a milder taste than the cloves. They are often used in stir frying or braised like asparagus. [[24]](#cite_note-scapes-25) Garlic leaves are a popular vegetable in many parts of Asia. The leaves are cut, cleaned, and then stir-fried with eggs, meat, or vegetables. [Garlic powder](/wiki/Garlic_powder) is made from dehydrated garlic and can be used as a substitute for fresh garlic, though the taste is not quite the same. [Garlic salt](/wiki/Garlic_salt) combines garlic powder with table salt. Regions[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Garlic&action=edit\u00a7ion=15)] Garlic is a fundamental component in many or most dishes of various regions, including eastern Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, northern Africa, [southern Europe](/wiki/Cuisine_of_the_Mediterranean), [Eastern Europe](/wiki/Mujdei) and parts of Latin America. [[52]](#cite_note-53) Latin American seasonings, particularly, use garlic in [sofritos](/wiki/Sofrito) and [mofongos](/wiki/Mofongo). [[53]](#cite_note-54) Oils can be flavored with garlic cloves. These infused oils are used to season all categories of [vegetables](/wiki/Vegetables), meats, breads, and [pasta](/wiki/Pasta). Garlic, along with [fish sauce](/wiki/Fish_sauce), chopped fresh chilis, [lime juice](/wiki/Lime_juice), sugar, and water, is a basic essential item in [dipping fish sauce](/wiki/N%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Bc_ch%E1%BA%A5m), a highly used dipping sauce condiment [Indochina](/wiki/Indochina). In [East](/wiki/East_Asia) and [Southeast with garlic is a popular [dipping sauce](/wiki/Dipping_sauce), especially for meat and seafood. [Tuong ot toi Viet Nam](/wiki/Tuong_ot_toi_Viet_Nam) (Vietnam chili garlic sauce) is a highly popular condiment and dip across North America and Asia. In some cuisines, the young bulbs are pickled for three to six weeks in a mixture of sugar, salt, and spices. In eastern Europe, the shoots are pickled and eaten as an appetizer. [Laba garlic](/wiki/Laba_garlic), prepared by soaking garlic in [vinegar](/wiki/Vinegar), is a type of pickled garlic served with [dumplings](/wiki/Dumpling) in northern China to celebrate the [Chinese New Year](/wiki/Chinese_New_Year). [[2]](#cite_note-Block2010-2) Garlic is essential in Middle Eastern and Arabic cooking, with its presence in many food items. In Levantine countries such as [Jordan](/wiki/Jordan) and [Lebanon](/wiki/Lebanon), garlic is traditionally crushed together with olive oil, and occasionally salt, to create a Middle Eastern garlic sauce called [Toum](/wiki/Toum) (; meaning \"garlic\" in Arabic). While not exclusively served with meats, toum is commonly paired with chicken or other meat dishes such as [shawarma](/wiki/Shawarma). Garlic is also a key component in some [hummus](/wiki/Hummus) varieties, an Arabic dip composed of chickpeas, tahini, garlic, lemon juice, and salt. Lightly [smoked](/wiki/Smoking_(cooking)) garlic is used in British and other European cuisine. It is particularly prized for stuffing poultry and game, and in soups and stews. Emulsifying garlic with olive oil produces [aioli](/wiki/Aioli). Garlic, oil, and a chunky base produce [skordalia](/wiki/Skordalia). Crushed garlic, oil, and water produce a strong flavored sauce, [mujdei](/wiki/Mujdei). Blending garlic, [almond](/wiki/Almond), oil, and soaked bread produces [ajoblanco](/wiki/Ajoblanco). [Tzatziki](/wiki/Tzatziki), yogurt mixed with garlic and salt, is a common sauce in Eastern Mediterranean cuisines. Storage[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Garlic&action=edit\u00a7ion=16)] Domestically, garlic is stored warm [above 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F)] and dry to keep it dormant (to inhibit sprouting). It is traditionally hung; softneck varieties are often braided in strands called plaits or [grappes](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikt:grappe). Peeled cloves may be stored in [wine](/wiki/Wine) or [vinegar](/wiki/Vinegar) in the refrigerator. [[54]](#cite_note-55) Commercially, garlic is stored at 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F), in a dry, low- [humidity](/wiki/Humidity) environment. Garlic will keep longer if the tops remain attached. [[15]](#cite_note-SFNA-16) Garlic is often kept in oil to produce flavored oil; however, the practice requires measures to be taken to prevent the garlic from spoiling which may include rancidity and growth of [Clostridium botulinum](/wiki/Clostridium_botulinum). [[55]](#cite_note-umaine-56) Acidification with a mild solution of vinegar minimizes bacterial growth. [[55]](#cite_note-umaine-56) Refrigeration does not assure the safety of garlic kept in oil, requiring use within one month to avoid bacterial spoilage. [[55]](#cite_note-umaine-56) Garlic is also dried at low temperatures, to preserve the enzymatic activity and sold and kept as garlic granules, and can be rehydrated to reactivate it. [[56]](#cite_note-57) Stored garlic can be affected by [Penicillium](/wiki/Penicillium) decay known as \"blue mold\" (or \"green mold\" in some locales), especially in high humidity. [[57]](#cite_note-58) Infection may first appear as soft or water-soaked spots, followed by white patches (of [mycelium](/wiki/Mycelium)) which turn blue or green with [sporulation](/wiki/Sporulation). [[58]](#cite_note-59) As sporulation and [germination](/wiki/Germination) are delayed at low temperature, and at 4 deg. C are inhibited entirely, [[59]](#cite_note-60) in refrigerated cloves one may only see the white mycelium during early stages. [Penicillium hirsutum](/wiki/Penicillium_hirsutum) [[60]](#cite_note-61) and [Penicillium allii](/wiki/Penicillium_allii) [[61]](#cite_note-62) are two of the predominant species identified in blue mold. Medical research[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Garlic&action=edit\u00a7ion=17)] Cardiovascular[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Garlic&action=edit\u00a7ion=18)] As of 2016, [clinical research](/wiki/Clinical_research) found that consuming garlic produces only a small in [blood pressure](/wiki/Blood_pressure) (4 mmHg), [[62]](#cite_note-Ried2008-63) [[63]](#cite_note-rohner-64) [[64]](#cite_note-Stabler2012-65) [[65]](#cite_note-66) and effect on [hypertension](/wiki/Hypertension), cardiovascular [morbidity](/wiki/Morbidity) or [mortality](/wiki/Death). [[64]](#cite_note-Stabler2012-65) A 2016 [meta-analysis](/wiki/Meta-analysis) indicated there was no effect of garlic consumption on blood levels of [lipoprotein(a)](/wiki/Lipoprotein(a)), a [biomarker](/wiki/Biomarker) of [atherosclerosis](/wiki/Atherosclerosis). [[66]](#cite_note-67) Because garlic might reduce [platelet aggregation](/wiki/Platelet_aggregation), people taking [anticoagulant](/wiki/Anticoagulant) medication are cautioned about [[67]](#cite_note-68) [cohort studies](/wiki/Cohort_study) found a moderate inverse association between garlic intake and some cancers of the upper [digestive tract](/wiki/Digestive_tract). [[69]](#cite_note-70) Another meta-analysis found decreased rates of [stomach cancer](/wiki/Stomach_cancer) associated with garlic intake, but cited confounding factors as limitations for interpreting these studies. [[70]](#cite_note-71) Further meta-analyses found similar results on the incidence of stomach cancer by consuming [allium](/wiki/Allium) vegetables, including garlic. [[71]](#cite_note-72) [[72]](#cite_note-73) A 2014 meta-analysis of [observational](/wiki/Observational_study) [epidemiological](/wiki/Epidemiology) studies found that garlic consumption was associated with a lower risk of stomach cancer in Korean people. [[73]](#cite_note-Woo2014-74) A 2016 meta-analysis found no effect of garlic on [colorectal cancer](/wiki/Colorectal_cancer). [[74]](#cite_note-75) A 2014 meta-analysis found garlic supplements or allium vegetables to have no effect on colorectal cancers. [[75]](#cite_note-76) A 2013 meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies found limited evidence for an association between higher garlic consumption and reduced risk of [prostate cancer](/wiki/Prostate_cancer), but the studies were suspected as having [publication bias](/wiki/Publication_bias). [[76]](#cite_note-Zhou2013-77) Common cold[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Garlic&action=edit\u00a7ion=20)] A 2014 review found insufficient evidence to determine the effects of garlic in preventing or treating the [common cold](/wiki/Common_cold). [[77]](#cite_note-Cochrane2014-78) Other reviews concluded a similar absence of high-quality evidence for garlic having a significant effect on the common cold. [[7]](#cite_note-nih-7) [[78]](#cite_note-Allan2014-79) Other uses[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Garlic&action=edit\u00a7ion=21)] The sticky juice within the bulb cloves is used as an [adhesive](/wiki/Adhesive) in mending glass and porcelain. [[3]](#cite_note-AN-3) An environmentally benign garlic-derived polysulfide product is approved for use in the European Union (under Annex 1 of 91/414) and the UK as a [nematicide](/wiki/Nematicide) and [insecticide](/wiki/Insecticide), including for use in the control of [cabbage root fly](/wiki/Cabbage_root_fly) and [red mite](/wiki/Red_mite) in poultry. [[79]](#cite_note-80) Garlic has [antioxidant](/wiki/Antioxidant) and [anti-inflammatory](/wiki/Anti-inflammatory) properties, which give it great therapeutic potential against a number of diseases. [[80]](#cite_note-81) Adverse effects and toxicology[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Garlic&action=edit\u00a7ion=22)] Garlic is known to cause bad breath ( [halitosis](/wiki/Halitosis)) and body odor, described as a pungent garlicky smell to sweat. [[6]](#cite_note-drugs-6) This is caused by [allyl methyl sulfide](/wiki/Allyl_methyl_sulfide) (AMS). AMS is a volatile liquid which is absorbed into the blood during the metabolism of garlic-derived sulfur compounds; from the blood it travels to the lungs [[2]](#cite_note-Block2010-2) (and from there to the mouth, causing bad breath; see [garlic breath](/wiki/Garlic_breath)) and skin, where it is exuded through skin pores. Washing the skin with soap is only a partial and imperfect solution to the smell. Studies have shown sipping milk at the same time as consuming garlic can significantly neutralize bad breath. [[81]](#cite_note-milk-82) Mixing garlic with milk in the mouth before swallowing reduced the odor better than drinking milk afterward. [[81]](#cite_note-milk-82) Plain water, mushrooms, and basil may also reduce the odor; the mix of fat and water found in milk, however, was the most effective. [[81]](#cite_note-milk-82) The green, dry \"folds\" in the center of the garlic clove are especially [pungent](/wiki/Pungency). The [sulfur](/wiki/Sulfur) compound [allicin](/wiki/Allicin), produced by crushing or chewing fresh garlic, [[6]](#cite_note-drugs-6) produces other sulfur compounds: [ajoene](/wiki/Ajoene), allyl polysulfides, and [vinyldithiins](/wiki/Vinyldithiin). [[2]](#cite_note-Block2010-2) Aged garlic lacks allicin, but may have some activity due to the presence of S-allylcysteine. Some people suffer from [allergies](/wiki/Garlic_allergy) to garlic and other species of [Allium](/wiki/Allium). [[2]](#cite_note-Block2010-2) Symptoms can include [irritable bowel](/wiki/Irritable_bowel), [diarrhea](/wiki/Diarrhea), mouth and throat ulcerations, [nausea](/wiki/Nausea), breathing difficulties, and, in rare cases, [anaphylaxis](/wiki/Anaphylaxis). [[6]](#cite_note-drugs-6) people show positive tests to [diallyl disulfide](/wiki/Diallyl_disulfide), allylpropyldisulfide, allylmercaptan, and allicin, all of which are present in garlic. People who suffer from garlic allergies are often sensitive to many other plants, including [onions](/wiki/Onion), [chives](/wiki/Chives), [leeks](/wiki/Leek), [shallots](/wiki/Shallot), garden lilies, [ginger](/wiki/Ginger), and [bananas](/wiki/Banana). Several reports of serious burns resulting from garlic being applied [topically](/wiki/Topical) for various purposes, including naturopathic uses and [acne](/wiki/Acne) treatment, indicate care must be taken for these uses, usually testing a small area of skin using a low concentration of garlic. [[82]](#cite_note-83) On the basis of numerous reports of such burns, including burns to children, topical use of raw garlic, as well as insertion of raw garlic into body cavities, is discouraged. [[6]](#cite_note-drugs-6) In particular, topical application of raw garlic to young children is not advisable. [[83]](#cite_note-84) The side effects of long-term garlic supplementation are largely unknown. [[6]](#cite_note-drugs-6) Possible side effects include gastrointestinal discomfort, sweating, dizziness, allergic reactions, bleeding, and menstrual irregularities. [[7]](#cite_note-nih-7) Some breastfeeding mothers have found, after consuming garlic, that their babies can be slow to feed, and have noted a garlic odor coming from them. [[6]](#cite_note-drugs-6) [[84]](#cite_note-UKMi-85) If higher-than-recommended doses of garlic are taken with [anticoagulant](/wiki/Anticoagulant) medications, this can lead to a higher risk of bleeding. [[6]](#cite_note-drugs-6) [[85]](#cite_note-Brown2015-86) Garlic may interact such as [ciprofloxacin](/wiki/Ciprofloxacin), and [hypoglycemic](/wiki/Hypoglycemic) drugs, as well as other medications. [[84]](#cite_note-UKMi-85) The [American Veterinary Medical Association](/wiki/American_Veterinary_Medical_Association) does not recommend feeding garlic to your pets. [[86]](#cite_note-87) Spiritual and religious uses[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Garlic&action=edit\u00a7ion=23)] Garlic is present in the [folklore](/wiki/Folklore) of many cultures. In Europe, many cultures have used garlic for protection or [white magic](/wiki/White_magic), perhaps owing to its reputation in [folk medicine](/wiki/Folk_medicine). [[7]](#cite_note-nih-7) Central European folk beliefs considered garlic a powerful ward against [demons](/wiki/Demon), [werewolves](/wiki/Werewolf), and [vampires](/wiki/Vampire). To ward off vampires, garlic could be worn, hung in windows, or rubbed on chimneys and keyholes. [[87]](#cite_note-asdf-88) [[88]](#cite_note-89) In the foundation myth of the ancient Korean kingdom of [Gojoseon](/wiki/Gojoseon), eating nothing but 20 cloves of garlic and a bundle of [Korean mugwort](/wiki/Artemisia_princeps) for 100 days let a [bear be transformed into a woman](/wiki/Ungnyeo). [[89]](#cite_note-90) In celebration of [Nowruz](/wiki/Nowruz) (Persian calendar New Year), garlic is one of the essential items in a [Haft-sin](/wiki/Haft-sin) (\"seven things beginning with 'S'\") table, a traditional New Year's display: the name for garlic in [Persian](/wiki/Persian_language) is (seer), which begins with \"\" (sin, pronounced \"seen\") the [Perso-Arabic](/wiki/Perso-Arabic) letter corresponding to \"S\". In [Islam](/wiki/Islam), it is recommended not to eat raw garlic prior to going to the mosque. This is based on several [hadith](/wiki/Hadith). [[90]](#cite_note-91) [[91]](#cite_note-92) Nutrition[ serving size of 1-3 cloves (3-9 grams), garlic provides no significant nutritional value, with the content of all [essential nutrients](/wiki/Essential_nutrients) below 10% of the [Daily Value](/wiki/Daily_Value) (DV) (table). [[92]](#cite_note-nd-93) When expressed per 100 grams, garlic contains several nutrients in rich amounts (20% or more of the DV), including vitamins [B6](/wiki/Vitamin_B6) and [C](/wiki/Vitamin_C), and the [dietary minerals](/wiki/Dietary_mineral) [manganese](/wiki/Manganese) and [phosphorus](/wiki/Phosphorus). Per 100 gram serving, garlic is also a moderate source (10-19% DV) of certain B vitamins, including [thiamin](/wiki/Thiamin) and [pantothenic acid](/wiki/Pantothenic_acid), as well as the dietary minerals [calcium](/wiki/Calcium), [iron](/wiki/Iron), and [zinc](/wiki/Zinc) (table).
