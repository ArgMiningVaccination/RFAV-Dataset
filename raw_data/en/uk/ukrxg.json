ICAN requested from the CDC to supply the studies relied upon to substantiate the claim that vaccines do not cause Autism, specifically relating to those vaccines administered to babies within the first 6 months of life. The CDC appeared to initially refuse to provide the requested information, however after legal proceedings they did agree to supply 20 studies. Representing their entire body of evidence supporting the claim that vaccines do not cause Autism. From a layman's position the provided studies did not seem to properly address and fulfil the request. Leaving some doubt as to whether sufficient studies have actually taken place in order to put the issue 'to bed'. As Public Health England are responsible for the immunisation program in England the request is coming your way, as opposed to the NHS. Much like the CDC the NHS website clearly states (https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/why-vaccination-is-safe-and-important/) that Vaccines do not cause autism. Although the NHS goes on the specifically mention the MMR, please note this request is NOT necessarily about the MMR. In the same vain as the MMR caveat when answering this request, the request is regarding studies of the vaccines as a whole, NOT individual ingredients. Now of course if there are studies that evaluate individual ingredients relating to the subject concerned, which when these 'individual' studies are packaged together make up to whole sum of a given vaccine, then this will be of great interest. REQUEST: To summerise, can you provide details of the studies relied upon to substantiate the NHS claim that vaccines DON'T cause autism for the following vaccinations administered from birth to 6 months. NOTE: the specific formulations and manufacturer. 1. DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB (Infanrix hexa). Provide all studies proving that the vaccine does not cause autism.* 2. MenB (Bexsero) Provide all studies proving that the vaccine does not cause autism.* 3. Rotavirus (Rotarix) Provide all studies proving that the vaccine does not cause autism.* 4. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevenar 13) Provide all studies proving that the vaccine does not cause autism.* 5. Cumulative. Provide all studies proving that the prescribed/recommended vaccine cumulative exposure does not cause autism.* *In babies from birth to 6 months.
