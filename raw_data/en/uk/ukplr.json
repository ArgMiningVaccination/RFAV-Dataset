The uninterrupted contact of the hair with the oil further reinforces and sustains the natural shine of the hair. One session of Shirodhara can lead to positive effects when it comes to controlling hair fall. 2. Relaxes mind and body The medicated oils used in Shirodhara help in the relaxation of mind and body.
