However, to do that, we have to abstract those regularities in our living together first; we must respect ourselves accepting that naming is not a trivial aspect of what we do in our living: names have arisen in our history of living together as operational elements of coordination of our doings, and reveal regularities in that living.\" \"We have to admit that we start from one fiction: we presume that the metaphysical sense of artistic configurations is well known. In reality, it is any how familiar as demonstrate the efforts of philosophical aesthetics\" Hans Prinzhorn Abstract The psychiatrist Nise da Silveira (1905-1999) pioneered several major innovations in Brazilian mental health policy. She developed a clinical practice grounded in the principles of Jung's analytical psychology and applied this approach to the spontaneous expressive productions of patients with chronic psychosis. In 1946, she created the Museum of Images of the Unconscious, which maintains an on growing archive of some 360,000-art works by patients of the oldest Brazilian psychiatric hospital. She also inaugurated, the House of the Palms (Casa das Palmeiras) in 1957, one of the first outpatient cultural clinics. She published hundreds of articles and several books, the most important of which include: Images of the Unconscious, The World of Images, Letters to Spinoza, Jung: life and work, and Cats: Emotion of Coping. She also produced dozens of film documentaries, three of them in collaboration with the Brazilian filmmaker Leon Hirszman and organized hundreds of art exhibitions. She trained generations of psychiatrists, occupational therapists, and psychologists, and influenced many artists and people from all walks of life. Working at a time when psychiatric therapeutics was dominated by Electroconvulsotherapy-ECT and lobotomy, she fought for a paradigm change that was rooted in political recognition of patients' agency and respect for the self-healing functions of art and the unconscious. Her work remains a vital 2 inspiration for a new generation of mental health workers in Brazil and in the world. The theater is one of the oldest cultural traditions of mankind. From primordial times, the mimic gesture and dance became one of the most elementary forms of communication (Silveira N, 1992), elaborated at some point in the history of hominid evolution initiated about three million years ago, when the first ancestors diverged from chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans, our closest relatives who remain in our place of origin: the African jungles (Maturana, From Biology to Psychology, 2006) Abstract: We face a scientific and political historical moment of mental health crisis worldwide. It is a clear that the current paradigm of modern biology, namely Neo-Darwinism and its derivatives in medicine and public health, show alarming signs of exhaustion and iatrogenic damage to human and biological health. In no other field this contradiction becomes so blatant as in public mental health. We are witnessing the growing of a pandemic of mental illness that the own scientific system managed to construct and lose control. The excessive, widespread, worldwide use of psychotropic pharmaceuticals, the alarming reports of iatrogenic side effects and deaths, the growing levels of violence, genocides, wars in virtually every part of the planet denounces to us that the dominant scientific biomedical model are informing us wrong. In general, it is the scientific model that informs government decisions that induce the population to ultimately act with violence and rupture of biological relationships; from which our existence depends. A new biological paradigmatic synthesis has been published and developed in the last decades. This stems from practically observed experimental phenomena arising virtually from all fields of biology and medicine, specially, from socio-economic determination of mental health, when studies that show the major impacts of environment, education and level of income. In this paper, I shall present a comprehensive model of human biology and psychopathology rooted in the pioneering scientific works of the neurobiologist Humberto Maturana and the psychiatrist Carl Jung illustrating with contemporary scientific documented experiences of the American psychiatrist John Weir Perry and the Brazilian woman psychiatrist Nise da Silveira in the field of mental health promotion and our own documented and published experience in mental health promotion working under the new paradigm, in order to make sense of those apparent contradictions, and heal our ideas and practices. Conference Proceedings / 18th IUAES Word Congress 2018 This paper consists in an ethnography of the \"Hotel da Loucura\" [The Madness Hotel] project, which ran between 2012 and 2016 at the Center of Culture, Science and Health of the Municipal Department of Health and Civil Defense of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It was a public policy carried out in the format of an \"occupation\", located on two floors of an old infirmary of the Nise da Silveira Mental Health Institute, a centennial psychiatric hospital built in the district of Engenho de Dentro, in the suburbs of the city. Its program was fundamentally defined by the offer of artistic activities such as theater, music and expression workshops, as well as open mics, exhibitions, film shows and free courses in psychiatry and psychopathology, counting on the active participation of internal and external psychiatric patients in its maintenance. From a fieldwork carried out in this context, one analyzes the main tensions between the project's proposals and the hegemonic knowledges and practices in biomedical psychiatry, established in the articulation among psychopharmacology, the pharmaceutical industry and the State. It is argued that the coexistence of these practices does not imply a peaceful coexistence, showing, otherwise, the permanence of an assymetric relationship. A short re ection on the impact of culture in public health based on a four year experience heading the Center for Culture, Science and Health at the Public Health O ce of Rio de Janeiro City, Brazi(2009-2012). by Vitor Pordeus, MD, researcher, actor & public manager vitor.pordeus@smsdc.rio.rj.gov.br vitorpordeus@gmail.com Ritual Script of the DyoNises Theatre, Madness Hotel and Spa, Actor's training SHABESS contents Shakespeare, Haddad, Amir, Artaud, Euripides, Brecht, Silveira, Nise e Spinoza In the early 1900s, Brazilian psychiatry was marked by the use of controversial treatments, like electroconvulsive therapy, psychosurgery, and insulin coma therapy. In 1946, the Brazilian physician Nise da Silveira took the front line in criticizing these treatments by setting up a creative activities studio in the National Psychiatric Center (Centro Psiqui\u00e1trico Nacional), in Rio de Janeiro. The article examines the theoretical basis for Silveira's medical-scientific project, drawing on documental sources and fieldwork with the study group at the Museum of Images from the Unconscious (Museu de Imagens do Inconsciente), maintained by her disciples. It is argued that her thinking constituted a rejection of the assumptions of physicalism and mechanism and was closer to the ontology of vitalism and romanticism. This paper presents partial results of a post-doctoral research conducted at TrAIN-Transnational Art Identity and Nation Research Center. This research is part of a broader study designed to investigate how the fields of mental health and art became interrelated in Brazil between the mid-19th and 20th century. Our coordinates in the construction of this investigation were various works, paths and experiments, performed by artists, patients, doctors and therapists who brought together art, madness and clinical practice. In this field of interface, H\u00e9lio Oiticica and Lygia Clark played an important role as artists who have their poetic project marked by a close proximity to the production of subjectivity, health, and social participation. Their works were very much informed by a Brazilian experience with art developed in a Psychiatric Hospital. Conversely, pathways opened by their inventions could be of interest to contemporary mental health practices. A summer night's dream at Ahuntsic Park Evoe! Evoe! Dionysus is free!!! I cry out with joy. Three young girls have joined our cortege. They are dressed as Bacchae and are playing with us. A man and two women, one holding her baby in her arms have joined us for the finale. I hold the hand of a woman I do not know, as we sing together \"we are a circle within a circle with no beginning and no end\" 1. She smiles at me with an open heart. I am moved and I feel grateful for this moment of shared grace. May happiness fall on us like rain Bringing hope to men who no longer want to suffer Joy and pleasure are vocations of the living May happiness fall on us like rain Loading Preview Sorry, preview is currently unavailable.
