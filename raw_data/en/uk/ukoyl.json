Download date: 16. Sep. 2023ARTICLE OPEN Cellular and molecular synergy in AS01-adjuvanted vaccines results in an early IFN response promoting C. Waters4, Katrijn Deun5,6, Age K. Smilde7, Robert A. David immunostimulants in adjuvants can improve the quality of the immune response to vaccines. Here, we report a uniquemechanism of molecular and cellular synergy between a TLR4 ligand, 3- O-desacyl-4 '-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), and a QS-21, the constituents of the Adjuvant System AS01. AS01 is part of the malaria and herpes zoster vaccine candidates that have demonstrated ef cacy in phase III studies. Hours after injection of AS01-adjuvanted vaccine, resident cells, such as NK cells and CD8 +T cells, release IFN in the lymph node draining the injection site. This effect results from MPL and QS-21 synergy and is controlled by macrophages, IL-12 and IL-18. Depletion strategies showed that this early IFN production was essential for the activation of dendritic cells and the development of Th1 immunity by AS01-adjuvanted vaccine. A similar activation was observedin the lymph node of AS01-injected macaques as well as in the blood of individuals receiving the malaria RTS,S vaccine. This mechanism, previously described for infections, illustrates how adjuvants trigger naturally occurring pathways to improve the efcacy of vaccines. npj Vaccines (2017) 2:25 ; doi:10.1038/s41541-017-0027-3 INTRODUCTION Adjuvants are included in vaccines to improve humoral and cellular immune responses, particularly with poorly immunogenicsubunit vaccines. Similar to natural infections by pathogens, adjuvants activate the innate immune system to promote long- lasting adaptive immunity. 1As simultaneous activation of multiple innate pathways is a feature of infections, adjuvants such as the Adjuvant Systems combine multiple immunostimulants to pro- mote adaptive immune responses to vaccination.1 The Adjuvant System AS01 is a liposome-based adjuvant which contains two immunostimulants, 3- O-desacyl-4 '-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and QS-21.2MPL is a non-toxic derivative of the lipopolysaccharide from Salmonella minnesota . QS-21 is a saponin fraction extracted from Quillaja saponaria Molina.2AS01 is included in the recently developed malaria vaccine RTS,S (Mosquirix )3and in other candidate vaccines in development zoster (HZ/su),4HIV,5and tuberculosis.6The promotion of antigen-speci c CD4+T cells in addition to antigen-speci c antibodies sets AS01 apart from other adjuvants.2 AS01-adjuvanted vaccines have also been effective in challenging populations, such as infants (with RTS,S against malaria3) and the older adults (HZ/su against herpes zoster4). AS01 injection results in rapid and transient activation of innate immunity in animal models. Activated MHCIIhighdendritic cells(DCs), which are necessary for T-cell priming, neutrophils and monocytes are rapidly recruited to the draining lymph node (dLN).7It is also recognized that the two components of AS01 can have distinct functions. MPL signals via TLR4, stimulating NF- B transcriptional activity and cytokine production and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) both in human and inmice. 8QS-21 can activate the in flammasome in vitro9and promotes high antigen-speci c antibody and CD8+T-cell responses in mice and antigen-speci c antibody responses in humans.10However, what is less clear is how immunostimulants function in combination. Here, we investigate how combining immunostimulants results in complex patterns of innate immune activation. We present evidence from mouse, non-human primate and clinical studiesthat the MPL-QS-21 combination in AS01 results in the stimulation of de novo pathways that were not triggered by the individual components, but were essential for the promotion of a polyfunc-tional CD4 +T-cell response and Th1-antibody isotype switching. We also reveal that AS01 triggers naturally occurring defensemechanisms, including NK-cell and innate-like CD8 +T-cell activation in the lymph node at the earliest stages of theinnate immune response. Finally, we have shown that those mechanisms play a role in protection conferred by AS01- containing vaccine.

Didierlaurent (arnaud.x.didierlaurent@gsk.com)www.nature.com/npjvaccines Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine DevelopmentRESULTS The combination of MPL and QS-21 induces potent adaptive immune response to AS01-adjuvanted vaccines We initially assessed the contribution of MPL and QS-21 in the adjuvant effect of AS01 using the RTS,S vaccine. The RTS,S antigen consists of a fusion of the central repeat and C-terminal flanking regions of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) with the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs), coexpressed with HBs alone. Naive wild-type (WT) mice were immunized with RTS,S formulated either without adjuvant, with MPL, with QS-21 (both formulated in liposomes) or with AS01. Two immunizations were administered 2 weeks apart and the HBs- and CSP-speci c immune response (serum IgG and T-cell responses) was measured after the second dose. RTS,S/AS01-induced antigen-speci c IgG responses were higher than those induced by either RTS,S/MPL or RTS,S/QS-21 (Fig. 1a). RTS,S/AS01 also RTS,S/QS-21, virtually no antigen-speci c T-cells (Fig. 1b, c). Notably, very low levels of CD8+T-cell responses were generated against CSP (Fig. 1c), as previously reported.11 Additionally, RTS,S/AS01 induced predominantly a Th1 response,12 with a relatively high prevalence of IFN +IL-2+TNF+phenotype (Fig. 1b), as reported for other antigens.12,13As previous reports suggested that triple-positive CD4+T cells produce higher levels of cytokines,14we assessed this in WT mice immunized with HBs/ AS01 on day 0 and day 14 (Supplementary Fig. 1). HBs is the antigen used in the Engerix vaccine and it induced cellular responses in mice vaccinated with RTS,S/AS01(Fig. 1b, c). For each CD4+T-cell phenotype, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) ofeach cytokine was measured as a proxy for the level of protein production. This analysis con rmed that the triple-positive IFN+IL-2+TNF+CD4+T cells produced the highest levels of each of the cytokines, in comparison with single- or double-positive T cells (Supplementary Fig. 1). Hence, combining MPL and QS-21 in AS01 results in enhanced adaptive immune responses to RTS,Sin comparison with the individual immunostimulants. Complex interplay between MPL and QS-21 in AS01 transcriptional response To investigate the molecular pathways induced by AS01, we analyzed the gene expression pro le in the dLN of C57BL/6 mice injected i.m. with AS01 after 2, 4, and 6 h. Bioinformatics analysisidenti ed a number of genes differentially expressed over sham treatment (differentially expressed genes = DEG; log 2(fold change) >2 ; p< 0.01; Supplementary Figure 2A). Pathway enrichment analysis of DEG showed that the response to AS01 was concentrated at 4 and 6 h, with few pathways enriched at 2 h (Fig. 2a). A notable exception was the pathway \"Immune response -Th17 related cytokines \", which includes multiple pleiotropic innate cytokines (Supplementary Fig. 2B), con rming that AS01 rapidly activates innate immunity in the dLN.7The processes enriched by AS01 included those related to cytokines, such as interferons, MIF and IL-2. In particular, the interferon-signaling pathway was the most highly enriched pathway at 4 and 6 h, andcontributed the most to the variability in the microarray data set (Supplementary Fig. 2C). Moreover, at 6 h, an IL-10-driven anti- inflammatory pathway was also induced by AS01. Fig. 1 MPL and QS-21 act synergistically to induce strong antigen-speci c CD4+T-cells and antibody responses. C57BL/6 mice were immunized twice 2 weeks apart with the RTS,S antigen formulated together with last immunization, titers were assessed by ELISA ( n=30 mice/group, 1 out of 2 independent experiments is shown). b,cSpleens were obtained 7 days after the last dose of vaccine and splenocytes were restimulated with a pool of peptide spanning the length of HBs or CSP . bAntigen-speci c cytokine production by CD4+ T cells as assessed by ICS. cAntigen-speci c cytokine production by CD8+T cells as assessed by ICS ( n=5 mice/group, 1 out of 2 independent experiments is shown). Bar charts show mean \u00b1SEMSynergistic effects in AS01 innate immune response M Coccia et al. 2 npj Vaccines (2017) 25 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine DevelopmentTo understand the contribution of MPL and QS-21 to gene expression induced by AS01, we compared the transcription response of the three adjuvants (pathways enriched in MPL and QS-21-induced responses are described in Supplementary Fig. 2D). To go beyond the simple pairwise comparison between immu-nostimulants, we used a statistical approach initially designed for the analysis of combination drugs. 15This approach categorizes the potential contributive relationships that MPL and QS-21 provide inAS01 for each gene expressed (Fig. 2b, examples are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2D). As shown by the high proportion of genes falling into the irrelevance of MPL orirrelevance of QS-21 categories, over half the genes affected by AS01 can be ascribedas MPL-speci c or QS-21-speci c (Fig. 2c). Altogether, those MPL- or QS-21-speci c genes were generally more frequent than genes affected in an additive fashion by MPL and QS-21. Beyond thesimple additive effect, a number of genes were affected in asynergistic fashion and interestingly, we also identi ed a group of genes which were not induced by either QS-21 or MPL immunization alone, but which were present in AS01-immunizedanimals (Fig. 2c). We classi ed these genes as \"emergent \".Principal component analysis (PCA) was then used to assess which relationships contributed the most to the variation in gene expression over time after injection of AS01 or PBS. The rst 2 principal components (PCs) accounted for 78% of the variance (PC1 = 58%, PC2 = 20%; see bivariate plot Fig. 2d). Projecting each sample in this plot showed good separation between PBS andAS01 samples (across PC1), and between samples at different time points (across PC2). Further analysis showed that PC1 was enriched in early emergent genes, together with genes driven by QS-21 (asshown by enrichment in the irrelevance of MPL category). PC2 data were instead enriched with genes driven by antagonistic and additive interplays, together with QS-21-driven interplays and inhibitory by QS-21 . Overall, this analysis highlights the importance of emergent interplays and QS-21-driven effects in the transcriptional response to AS01. Innate IFN promotes adaptive immune response to AS01 adjuvanted antigens Our analysis showed that interferon-related signals were enriched in the transcriptional response to AS01 (Fig. 2a and Fig. 2 Statistical analysis reveals multiple types of interplays between the components of AS01. C57BL/6 mice ( Draining lymph nodes (dLNs) were isolated at indicated time points and gene expression was assessed by microarray analysis. Linear models and contrast analysiswere used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs, cutoffs: fold Change >2,p-value for contrast <0.01, adjusted for multiple comparisons). aFunctional analysis of DEGs was performed in MetaCore. The top 10 most enriched process networks for each time point are presented. Hierarchical clustering by column was performed to highlight similarities between time points. bA taxonomy of possible interplays between QS-21 and MPL in AS01 is shown.

A more focused evaluation of this signature at 4 h revealed a strong, synergistic induction of Ifng and the induction of number of genes in its signaling pathway, including Stat1 ,Jak2, and Ifngr2 (Fig. 3a). Noticeably, genes in this pathway fell into a number of interplay categories, highlightinghow within a same function, MPL and QS-21-mediated signalscontribute in different ways to the response to AS01. Numerous studies indicate an important role for innate immune-derived IFN in the induction of protective CD4 +T-cellresponses to infections.16-19We have previously shown that the innate immune response to AS01, but not to AS04 or emulsion- based adjuvants, is characterized by IFN -related production the con of IFN by MPL and QS-21 in AS01, we analyzed the levels of this cytokine in the dLN after immunization with HBs adjuvanted with AS01 or its CXCL10, with peaking at 6 h (Fig. 3b). In Synergistic effects in AS01 innate immune response M Coccia et al. 4 npj Vaccines (2017) 25 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Developmentcomparison, MPL and QS-21 also induced CXCL9 and CXCL10 production, albeit at concentrations lower than those observed with AS01. However, they failed to signi cantly induce IFN (Fig. level IFN mRNA at 4 h than MPL or QS-21 alone (Fig. 3c). The requirement for IFN in the induction of an adaptive immune response was rst assessed in IFN R-decient mice. Mice received two i.m. injections on Day 0 and Day 14 of AS01-adjuvanted or unadjuvanted vaccines containing two antigens, HBs and ovalbumin (OVA). HBs was selected because it is clinically relevant, and OVA was selected because it allows Ag-speci c CD8+ T cells to be detected using SIINFEKL-H2Kb pentamers. On Day 21, splenocytes were restimulated with HBs peptides and analyzed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) (Fig. 3d). As expected, the AS01-adjuvanted vaccine (HBs + OVA/AS01) elicited much stron- responses the 3e-g). with HBs + OVA/ induced very limited Th2 and Th17 responses, which wereunaffected by IFN Rd e ciency (Supplementary Fig. 3). In IFN R- decient mice, HBs + OVA/AS01 elicited a much lower HBs-speci c CD4+T-cell response than in WT mice, with CD4+T cells producing more than one cytokine particularly affected (Fig. 3e, f). HBs + OVA/AS01 also elicited a lower (although not signi cant) OVA- speci c CD8+T-cell response than WT mice p-value 0.16; Fig. 3g). The overall IgG titers to HBs + OVA/AS01 were unaffected by the Rd e ciency, but IFN R/mice showed decreased titers Ag-speci antibodies (Fig. 3h). As the IFN Rd eciency may affect the response to vaccination beyond the activity of AS01 on the innate phase of the response,we depleted early IFN in the dLN by administrating a low dose of IFNantibody (XMG1.2, 100 g i.p.22) or an isotype antibody control to WT mice 2 days before vaccination with HBs + OVA/AS01. As shown in Fig. 3i, j, a single administration of IFNmAb resulted in lower HBs-speci c CD4+T-cell responses in IFN - depleted mice than in control mice. By contrast and similar towhat was observed in the IFN R-decient mice, the IFNmAb did not signi cantly lower OVA-speci c CD8+T-cell responses or humoral responses (Fig. 3k, l). Overall, these data indicate that IFNproduction in the early phase after vaccination is important for the induction of polyfunctional CD4+T-cell response (mainly of a Th1 phenotype) and impact the quality of the antibody response to AS01-adjuvanted antigens. Given that IFN is known to modulate the function of APCs, we addressed its role in promoting the accumulation and maturationof innate immune cells in the dLN after injection of AS01. We have previously shown that AS01 induces the recruitment of neutro- phils, monocytes, and DCs in the dLN, peaking at h afterinjection. 7As expected, in the dLN of WT mice, the recruitment R-decient HBs/AS01 elicited a similar recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes to that in WT mice, but elicited a lower (although not signi cant) recruitment of DCs (Fig. 4a). Additionally, these recruited DCs expressed lower levels of the costimulatory molecules CD40, CD86, and CD80 (Fig. 4b, c) than those DCs in WT mice. Overall, these data show that the early IFN signal in response to AS01 is important in promoting APC activation, which may explain the impact on T-cell and antibody responses described above. NK cells and CD8+T cells produce IFN in the dLN within the rst 6 h of the response to AS01 The source of early IFN production in the dLN after injection of AS01 was investigated by flow cytometry. This showed that CD45+ cells produce IFN after 6 h (Fig. 4d). The CD45+IFN+population was composed on average of 51% NK cells, 37% TCR T cells (mainly CD8+T cells), 1.5% NKT cells and 10% of other cells 4e). Overall, 33% of NK cells produced IFN 0.2% When compared with AS01, MPL or QS-21 induced only a minimal accumulation of IFN +cells in the dLN at 6 h (Fig. rming the synergistic induction of IFN by AS01. Moreover, the relative proportion of cells producing IFN differed in mice injected with AS01, MPL, or QS-21 (Fig. 4g). Notably, in mice injected contributed IFN +CD45+cells). The proportion of IFN +NKT cells and IFN were induce early by NK cells and CD8+T in the dLN. found that AS01-induced IFN +NK cells were CD49b+(DX5+), Eomes+, ROR -, with conventional NK cells (Fig. 5a). Murine NK-cells developmental stages can be classi ed via the differential expression of the markers CD27 and CD11b.23AS01-induced IFN +NK cells expressed high levels of CD27, and included both CD11b+and CD11bpopulations, phenotypes consistent with a high cytokine-producing capacity (Fig. addition, the high-expression levels of CD44, CD69, and IFN +NK cells in comparison with IFN -NK cells suggest that they are activated effector cells (Fig. 5a). By contrast, IFN+NK cells expressed lower levels of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 than their and for the majority CD44HiCD49dlow(Fig. 5b, c). Together with their rapid IFN response to AS01, this phenotype suggests that most CD8+ T cells are unconventional virtual memory T cells.

In the dLN and after the injection of AS01, the changes in the IFN +subpopulation of NK cells differed from that of the entireNK cell population. The size of IFN +NK-cell subpopulation was largest at 6 h, returning to baseline at 24 h, while the number of total NK cells remained the same within the same timeframe (Supplementary Fig. 4A). Both populations then steadily increased Synergistic effects in AS01 innate immune response M Coccia et al. 7 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development npj Vaccines (2017) 25 by 48 h. By contrast, the size of IFN +CD8+T-cell subpopulation steadily increased from 3 h and paralleled that of the entire CD8+ T-cell population (Fig. 5d). Finally, the induction of IFN +cells was unaffected across a range of AS01 doses (dilutions up to 25-fold ofAS01, Supplementary Fig. 4B), excluding the possibility that the synergistic aspect of the induction of IFN by AS01 was dose dependent. As NK cells were the major IFN -producing cells in the dLN, we assessed the effect of NK-cell de ciency on the response to AS01- adjuvanted vaccines. For this purpose, we used a cre-lox mousemodel, in which the lethal diptheria toxin subunit was the control of the Nkp46 (NKp46- DTA mice). 24,25As expected, NKp46-DTA lacked NK cells in the dLN Fig. 4C). After immunization with HBs/ AS01, serum IFN levels were lower in the NK-cell-de cient mice than in WT mice (Fig. 5e). In the dLN, although IFN production by NK cells was abrogated, the levels of IFN +CD45+cells were similar in the NK-cell-de cient mice to that in WT mice, mainly due to compensatory production by other cells, including T cells (Fig. 5f, g). After immunization with HBs + OVA/AS01 (as in Fig. 3d), NK- cell de ciency resulted in a mild but signi cant reduction in antigen-speci c CD4+T-cell responses in the NKp46-DTA mice in comparison with littermate controls (Fig. 5h, i), suggesting a partial role for NK cells in promoting CD4+T-cell response to vaccination. Antigen-speci c CD8+T cells and antibody responses were not affected in this model (data not shown). Early IFN induction by AS01 is mediated by macrophages (SSM) promote innate IFN responses to infections, orchestrating both NK and CD8+T cells in this response.26,27To investigate whether SSM support early IFNproduction by AS01, we depleted SSM by i.m. administration of clodronate liposomes 6 days before the injection of AS01. Clodronate have been reported to ef affecting other state.28The levels of NK cells and CD8+T cells in the dLN were lower with clodronate treatment than with the controltreatment in mice injected with PBS or AS01, but the differencewas only signi cant (in a post hoc test) in the mice injected with AS01 (Fig. 6a). The depletion of SSM almost entirely blocked the AS01-induced IFN production by lymphoid (CD45 +) cells (Fig. 6b). Given that SSM are an essential reservoir of IL-18 and that this cytokine was required for innate IFN responses in the dLN upon infection with lymph-borne bacteria,27we investigated its role in our model. Both NK and CD8+T cells in the dLN expressed the receptor for IL-18 (IL-18R), with higher levels observed on NK cells, and no upregulation observed after AS01 injection (Fig. 6c,top). NK cells expressed similar levels of IL-18R irrespective of IFN production, whereas IFN +CD8+T cells expressed higher levels of IL-18R than their IFN counterparts (Fig. 6c,bottom ). We then investigated whether AS01-induced innate IFN production was affected by IL-18 de ciency by using Il18/mice, and by antibody-mediated depletion of IL-12 ( IL-12p40 antibody i.p. 1 day before vaccination), because of the known synergy betweenIL-12 and IL-18 to promote IFN responses. We observed that AS01-induced accumulation of IFN +lymphoid cells was depen- IL-18 and IL-12 (Fig. 6d). IFN +NK-cell levels were reduced in the absence of IL-18 or depletion of IL-12, and furtherreduced when both cytokines were targeted (Fig. 6e). By contrast, AS01-induced accumulation of IFN +CD8+T cells was mostly dependent on IL-18 (Fig. 6f). Next, we asked whether targeting IL-12 and IL-18 decreased adaptive immune responses to vaccination. Mice were immunized with HBs + OVA/AS01 or unadjuvanted HBs + OVA as in Fig. 3d. Neither IL-12 depletion nor IL-18 de ciency signi cantly + OVA/AS01 (Fig. 6g). depletion ciency signi cantly lowered the HBs-speci c CD4+T-cell response, most notably among the (multifunctional) HBs-speci c CD4+T cells expressing IFN and at least one other cytokine (Supplementary Fig. 5A). Overall, these results suggest that IL-18 and IL-12 contribute to the innate IFN response, both individually and in a synergistic fashion. Moreover, they support the hypothesis thatthese two cytokines synergize in promoting cellular adaptiveimmune responses to vaccination with AS01-adjuvanted antigens. Immunization with an AS01-adjuvanted vaccine is associated with innate IFN response across species, and it is associated with protection in a mouse model of malaria vaccination To evaluate the relevance of our ndings in mice with respect to human vaccination, we analyzed the serum IFN data from a clinical trial of the candidate malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS01 (TrialNCT00075049 12). Data were collected at 24 h after the rst RTS,S/ AS01 dose, a time point in which elevated serum IFN was detectable after vaccination in mice (Supplementary Fig. 5B). RTS, S/AS01 vaccination resulted in increased serum levels of IFN (Fig. 6h), indicating that an AS01-adjuvanted vaccine elicits an innate IFNresponse in humans. To extend these ndings to the dLN, we evaluated vaccine responses in non-human primates, a more clinically relevant species than mice. In these experiments, macaques were vaccinated with AS01-adjuvanted VZV glycopro-tein E (VZV) (Fig. 6i, j) or HIV recombinant fusion protein F4 (Fig. 6k). At 24 h, serum levels of IFN increased in the majority of AS01- adjuvanted vaccine recipients (Fig. 6i). In the dLN at 24 h, IFN levels were signi cantly higher in recipients of gE/AS01 than recipients of gE alone (Fig. 6j). After 24 h, the levels of IFN rapidly subsided in both the sera and dLNs. In addition, at 24 h, the levelof CD45 +IFN+cells was higher in the dLN than non-draining lymph nodes of recipients of gE/AS01, but not in the recipients of gE/alum (Fig. 6k). Overall, these data show that injection of AS01 results in the induction of IFN production locally in the dLN in a clinically relevant model.

To evaluate the relevance of our ndings to vaccine-induced protection, we used -AGM1 treatment in a mouse model of malaria vaccination and challenge. C57BL/6 mice were immunized with RTS,S/AS01 (as in Fig.3d) and then challenged with transgenic Plasmodium berghei parasites expressing the full length Plasmodium falciparum CSP.29 As almost no CSP-speci c CD8+T-cell response is elicited by RTS,S/AS01 (Fig. 1c), this model allowed us to minimize the impact of the reported off-target effects of -AGM1 on adaptive CD8+T cells.30 Treatment with -AGM1 before vaccination with RTS,S/AS01 resulted in a decreased frequency of CSP-speci c cytokine- producing CD4+T cells, including polyfunctional CD4+T cells (Fig. 6l, Supplementary Fig. 4J). By contrast, -AGM1 treatment 3 days after vaccination did not affect CSP-speci c CD4+T-cell frequencies (Supplementary Fig. 4H). Treatment with -AGM1 before vaccination also lowered the titres of full-length CSP-speci c Synergistic effects in AS01 innate immune response M Coccia et al. 9 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development npj Vaccines (2017) 25 IgGs, but levels of IgGs speci c for a protective repeat epitope were not signi cantly affected (Fig. 6m). In response to malaria challenge, all control mice (mice that did not receive RTS,S/AS01) developed blood-stage malaria by 4 daysafter challenge. By contrast, of the mice that received RTS,S/AS01and were not treated with -AGM1, 30% remained protected from malaria at 12 days after challenge (consistent with human data 13). In the mice that received RTS,S/AS01 and were -AGM1-treated, 10% remained protected to day 12 post infection (Fig. 6n). In comparison with control mice, the risk of infection was reduced byRTS/AS01 vaccination alone (hazard ratio = 0.224, 95% CI =0.077 -0.654), but not by RTS/AS01 vaccination and -AGM1- treatment (hazard ratio = 0.499, 95% CI = 0.194 -1.284). Overall, these data support the hypothesis that IFN -producing lymphoid cells play an important role in promoting protective immunityafter vaccination with RTS,S/AS01. DISCUSSION Combination adjuvants promote potent antigen-speci c immunity and increased protection from disease upon vaccination in humans. 1The potency of these adjuvants is likely to rely on complex molecular and cellular interplays, which are still poorlyunderstood in vivo. Here, we apply a customized statisticalframework to unravel the way that MPL and QS-21 contribute tothe transcriptional response to AS01 in the dLN. We also show thatMPL and QS-21 contribute to the synergistic production of innateIFNat the earliest stages of vaccination. This IFN production is critical for promoting polyfunctional Th1-biased antigen-speci c CD4 +T-cell responses to AS01-adjuvanted antigens and also impacts on the quality of the antibody response with a reductionin Th1-isotype switching. IFN is mainly produced by activated NK and CD8+T cells, and the process is controlled by the SSMs and IL- 12/IL-18, similar to the response to pathogens.27,31We also conrmed the clinical relevance of these ndings by showing that IFNproduction can be detected in the serum of vaccine recipients at 24 h after vaccination with RTS,S/AS01, and in the dLN of NHPs at 24 h after vaccination with AS01-adjuvantedantigens. Finally, we show that innate IFN production is important in mediating protection in a mouse model ofvaccination against malaria. Altogether, the study provides newinsights into how the unique design of AS01 (that is, the speci c combination of QS-21 and MPL in AS01) can account for theefcacy of AS01-containing vaccines. The rationale behind Adjuvant Systems and combination adjuvants is that combining two immunostimulants may triggermultiple immune pathways and improve the protective responseto vaccination. 1,15Yet, so far, most analyzes of combination adjuvants relied on visual comparisons between components inthe absence of comprehensive statistical testing.20Here, we used a customized taxonomy and statistical framework to understand how MPL and QS-21 interact in AS01 at the transcriptional level. In using this approach, we observed complex interplays, in additionto the expected additive or speci c effects related to each immunostimulant. Noticeably, 13 -15% of differentially expressed genes were regulated in an antagonistic fashion, suggestinginterference between MPL and QS-21 downstream processesin vivo. Moreover, 1 -3% of the transcriptional response was classi ed as emergent. This highlights the complexity of the response to adjuvant systems, with new, not pre-existing proper-ties emerging from the combination of different immunostimu-lants. Emergent genes contributed the most to the variation ingene expression induced by AS01, suggesting an important role ofthese genes in mediating AS01 's adjuvanticity. It is well established that IFN plays a crucial role in the innate immune response to infection, and that innate IFN can promote a Th1- polarizing environment in vivo. 16,32,33However, the role of innate IFN in clinically relevant adjuvant responses has not been investigated. We report that the combinatorial nature of AS01promotes the production of IFN by lymphoid cells in the dLN in therst few hours after vaccination. NK cells and CD8+T cells were the main sources of innate IFN . IFN +NK cells were mainly resident in the dLN, as little recruitment of NK cells was observedin the rst hours after vaccination. CD8+T cells had features of virtual memory CD8+T cells, which have been shown to participate in innate immune responses in an antigen-independent fashion.34Both the NK and the CD8+T-cell responses were dependent on SSMs, in a mechanism involving IL-18 and IL- 12, and independent from monocyte recruitment in the dLN, as the responses were preserved in Ccr2/mice (Kaat Fierens and Bart Lambrecht, personal communication). The innate IFN response to AS01 was remarkably similar to that describedFig. 6 Innate IFN production is mediated by SSM-derived IL-18, in combination with IL-12. a,bC57BL/6 were treated with 20 l of clodronate liposomes or control liposomes i.m.

Given the complexity ofAS01-mediated modulation of DC function and the heteroge- neous population of cells in the dLN, 7further experiments are needed to detail the interaction between NK cells and myeloidcells in dLN. Interestingly, a recent report showed early IFN production in the dLN of mice immunized with glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant-stable emulsion (GLA-SE).35Although the levels observed in that study were lower than those we report for AS01,it should be noted that GLA-SE is also able to induce T-cellresponses in vivo, 35supporting the hypothesis that early IFN production is important for obtaining productive T-cell responses to adjuvanted vaccines. The adjuvanticity of AS01 is at least partially mediated by the recruitment and activation of CD11c+MHCIIHiDCs.7Here, we show that the maturation of DCs is dependent on innate IFN release (presumably via a cell-intrinsic mechanism36), and that IFNyR deciency or simultaneous impairment of both IL-12 and IL-18 results in defective CD4+cellular immune responses to vaccina- tion. In addition, mice speci cally de cient in NK cells developed reduced CD4+T-cell responses to vaccination. Overall, this indicates that innate IFN is required to induce CD4+T-cell responses, with a Th1-bias after immunization with an AS01- adjuvanted vaccine, as further supported by the reduction inIgG2c antigen-speci c antibodies in the absence of innate IFN signals. However, the CD8+T-cell response and the overall magnitude of the humoral immune response were mostlypreserved in all these models suggesting that other yetundiscovered mechanisms also contribute to AS01 adjuvanticity. Nevertheless, the depletion of IFN -producing cells resulted in decreased RTS,S-mediated protection in a malaria challengemodel, accompanied by a decreased CSP-speci c CD4 +T-cell response and limited effects on protective antibodies. This suggests that the modulation of adaptive immunity mediated by innate IFN is relevant to protection. In addition, it suggests some role for both cellular and humoral adaptive immunity in RTS,S-mediated protection from malaria, as hinted by ndings from clinical trials.12 As QS-21 induces in flammasome activation in vitro and in vivo37 and MPL induces IL-12 secretion in vitro,8we hypothesized that the combination of these two immunostimulants in AS01 is essential for early IFN production. Accordingly, the innate IFN response to AS01 was fully dependent on both IL-18 and IL-12production in the dLN. Other members of the in flammasome- dependent cytokines, such as IL-1 , might contribute to the IFN response in vivo, but are likely to be redundant with IL-18.Furthermore, the components of AS01 reach the dLN as early as30 min after immunization 7(and data not shown). The liposome formulation of AS01 is most likely to play a role in its rapid drainage to the dLN and activation of SSM, as liposomes canimprove the targeting of their components to the lymph node38 and promote uptake by macrophages.39 We identi ed innate IFN as a major player in the innate immune response to AS01 in the earliest stages after immuniza-tion. Although the role for adaptive, T-cell-derived IFN in promoting effective immunization is well established,40little information is available regarding the role of this cytokine in theearly response to vaccination. Yet, evidence from clinical studiessuggests that major cellular and molecular changes occur in the rst 24 hours after immunization in humans. 41-43We show that vaccination with AS01-adjuvanted antigens results in upregulationof IFN levels in the serum of human subjects and in the serum and dLN of NHPs. Although caution should be used when extending the ndings from animal models to humans, this latter observation supports the hypothesis that innate cells underlieIFNproduction in humans who receive an AS01-adjuvanted vaccine. Indeed, CD56HiCD16-NK cells are enriched in human lymph nodes and are more ef cient at producing IFN than peripheral-blood NK cells,44,45and CD8+T cells with innate features were recently described in human blood and cord bloodsamples.46More investigations in appropriate models such as NHPs will be needed to understand the contribution of these celltypes to innate immune response to vaccination. Interestingly, individuals vaccinated with RTS,S/AS01 and protected from malaria presented increased activation of an IFN-related bloodtranscriptional module at D1 post vaccination, compared withnon-protected individuals. 47However, further work will need to fully demonstrate the requirement of an innate IFN response for the induction of effective vaccination in humans. It is also possiblethat such a mechanism will be ampli ed with successive vaccine doses, because antigen-speci c memory-T cells can promote IFN production by innate immune cells.36Indeed, a positive feedback loop between NK cells and CD4+T cells takes place during vaccination, malaria and VZV infections.48-50 Overall, our study provides compelling information regarding the mechanism of action of AS01, an adjuvant which has proven successful in improving immunogenicity and ef cacy in vaccines for challenging diseases such as malaria and herpes zoster.

In experiments with RTS,S/ used. Set-up experiments showed no impact of lower doses of AS01on its adjuvanticity in mice (data not shown). Human studies All blood samples were obtained from the RTS,S vaccine clinical trial(ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00075049).12The clinical trial was conducted in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, including the Declaration of Helsinki (1996). The clinical trial was approved byinstitutional review boards from the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) Human Use Review Committee (HURC) and the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) HumanSubjects Research Review Board (HSRRB). Written-informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to the performance of any study- speci c procedures in accordance with relevant ICH Guidelines, US Army Regulations and principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Serum IFN levels at D0 and D1 after immunization were measured by ELISA (R&D Systems) in 33/35 trial participants receiving RTS,S/AS01 due to missing data in 2individuals. Animal immunizations Animal husbandry and experiments were ethically reviewed and carriedout in accordance with European Directive 2010/63/EU and the GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.A. Policy on the Care, Welfare and Treatment of Animals. For the malaria challenge model (conducted at WRAIR)experiments were conducted under an approved animal use protocol in an AAALACi accredited facility in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and other federal statutes and regulations relating to animals and experimentsinvolving animals and adheres to principles stated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, NRC Publication, 2011 edition. C57Bl/6 mice were purchased from Harlan Horst, Netherlands. Ifngr /, Il18/and ROSA-stopfloxDTA mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (USA). Nkp46(iCre) mice were a gift of Prof. Eric Vivier. Mice were allocated across experimental groups by random draw. Experimen-ters were not blinded during tests. The i.m. injections were performed in 6-8 week-old mice, in both hind limbs, in the gastrocnemius (gcm) muscles and in a volume of 50 \u00b5l/muscle, unless otherwise stated. Iliac lymph nodesSynergistic effects in AS01 innate immune response M Coccia et al. 11 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development npj Vaccines (2017) 25 were identi ed as draining in set-up experiments, which also showed minimal immune activation in non-draining lymph nodes. Anti-IL-12p40mAb (C17.8, 0.5 mg i.p.) was purchased from BioXCell and i.p. the day before immunization. Anti-IFN mAb (XMG1.2) (BioXCell), was injected i.p. 48 h liposome and control liposomes(Clodrosome) were injected i.m. (2 \u00d7 20 l) in the gcm muscles 6 days before immunization. For NHP studies, 4 -6 years old Chinese rhesus macaques were used. Animals had been previously used in unrelated vaccination studies, but a resting period of 6 months minimum wasimposed to minimize any impact on this study. NHPs were randomizedand immunized intramuscularly in both left with AS01 (250 l/injection) and VZV glycoprotein E or HIV recombinant protein F4. Axillary lymph nodes were used as dLNs and cervical lymph nodes as non-draining lymph nodes. Malaria challenge model Mice were challenged i.v. on Day 0 with 3000 transgenic P. berghei sporozoites expressing P. falciparum CSP, collected from a single mosquito lot.29Mice were monitored from Day 2 -12 for parasitemia by blood smear under microscope. Mice were considered infected and euthanized afterexhibiting parasitemia on two consecutive days. All mice were euthanized on Day 12. Microarray analysis Total RNA was isolated by homogenizing pooled dLN in Tripure reagent (1 ml/100 mg tissue; Roche Applied Science) and then extracted with chloroform followed by RNeasy Minikit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer 's protocol. A DNAse treatment was applied on the RNeasy column to avoid genomic DNA contamination. RNA was concentrated byethanol precipitation, and quanti ed by RiboGreen (Life Technologies). 1 \u00b5g of each RNA sample was used for target preparation, using a one-cycle cDNA synthesis kit, and hybridized to GeneChip Whole Mouse Genome430 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix). Data acquisition was performed usingGeneChip Operating Software (Affymetrix). Data were quality controlled and normalized (RMA normalization) in R using Bioconductor packages. The data analysis pipeline is presented in Supplementary Fig. 6. Linear modeling and contrast analysis were performed using the limma Rpackage, PCA plots were generated using pca3d. Enrichment analysis on PCA components were generated using the tmod and tagcloud packages. Heatmaps were generated using the pheatmap packages. For identi ca- tion of interplay between AS01 components, for each gene, an effect scoreover PBS was calculated. The type of interplay for each DEG was identi ed in R using the algorithm described in ref. 15Briefly, an empirical Bayes procedure (in limma R package) was used to estimate the contrasts that make up the different forms of interplay and to assess their signi cance. The signi cance of a particular form of interplay was subsequently obtained by applying an intersection-union hypothesis testing procedure to the proper combination of contrasts. Equivalence intervals of [ 1,1] and ap-value of <0.05 were used as cutoff. Process Network enrichment analysis was performed in MetaCore (Thomson Reuters). Code availability R code with an implementation of the procedure to identify different formsof interplay between AS01 components is included in the Supporting Information of ref.15 Determination of antigen-speci c T-cell and antibody responses to vaccination Antigen-speci c antibody concentrations in the serum (de ned by internal standards) were measured by ELISA, as previously described.7,13To assess antigen-speci c T-cell response, 106splenocytes from immunized mice were stimulated in vitro with peptide pools of 15-mers with 11 amino acids overlap (1 \u00b5g/ml). Anti-CD49d and anti-CD28 antibodies (1 \u00b5g/ml, BDBiosciences) were added to the culture and the cells were incubated 2 h at37 \u00b0C 5% CO \u00b5g), sodium pyruvate (1 ) Brefeldin A (BFA) (1 g/ ml, BD Biosciences) was then added and cells were further culturedovernight at 37 \u00b0C 5% CO 2. Cell staining was performed as described previously.7,13Briefly, cells were washed and stained for surface markers, then xed and permeabilized using the BD Cyto x/Cytoperm solution kit. Cells anti-IFN -APC, and anti-TNF- -PE(all from BD) for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. The samples were analyzed with the LSRII flow cytometer (BD) and FlowJo software. A complete list of antibodies used in this study is presented in Supplementary Table 1. Innate cell phenotyping dLNs were rst treated by mechanical dissociation in 3 ml RPMI medium containing DNase I (100 \u00b5g/ml, Roche), 1 % FCS and Liberase (Roche) at0.26 U/ml for 30 min under agitation at room temperature. Digestion was stopped by adding 10 mM EDTA and incubating on ice. Cells were ltered (100 \u00b5M nylon cell strainer, BD Biosciences), washed and resuspended inPBS + 2 mM EDTA + 2 % FCS. The analysis of innate cell phenotype wasperformed as previously described. 7Monocytes were de ned as Ly6Chigh CD11b+,Ly6Gcells and neutrophils were de ned as exclusion of neutrophil, monocyte, gated as cation IFNproducing cells in mice, dLNs were dissociated and ltered cells were incubated for 3 h in RPMI 10% FCS + additives in the presence of BFA (1\u00b5g/ml, BD Biosciences) and \u00b0C 5% C0 2. After treatment with 2.4G2 antibody for 10 min to block the Fc receptor, cells were stained for the following NHP studies, collagenase-treated dLN were incubated for 5 h in RPMI 10% FCS + additives in the presence of BFA (1 \u00b5g/ml, BDBiosciences) and 37 \u00b0C 5% C0 2. Cells were then stained using the BD Cyto x/ Cytoperm FITC or PeCy7. Analysis of cytokine assessment of pro-in flammatory cytokine concentration, dLNs were collected after immunization at the indicated time points and stored at80 \u00b0C until further analysis. Organs were homogenized and cytokines were measured in supernatants as described previously. 7Protein levels were measured by Cytokine Bead Analysis (BD Biosciences) or ELISA (R&Dsystem) (mouse studies) or multiplex assay (Luminex,Milliplex Kit, Millipore)(NHP studies). For qPCR isolated by homogenizing dLN in Tripure reagent (Roche Applied Science) and then extracted with chloroform followed by RNeasy Minikit (Qiagen) according to themanufacturer 's protocol, with DNAse treatment. RNA was concentrated by ethanol precipitation, and quanti ed by RiboGreen (Invitrogen). 500 ng of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using Superscript II RNase H(Invitrogen) as per manufacturer 's protocol. RNA expression was quanti ed by real time PCR (RT-PCR) using the ABI was run the ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Perkin Elmer). Expression levels were quanti ed using the comparative Ct method and gene expression was determined relative to the mean value of the matched PBS-treated controls. Statistical analyzes Sample size with adequate statistical power in animal studies was determined based on previous experiments. Where appropriate, datawere log-tranformed and assumed to have a normal distribution. Depending on the study design, a Student's t-test or an ANOVA (one- or two-way, depending on the experimental design) followed by Bonferronicorrected t-test were applied to identify differences between treatments. Only signi cant differences are reported on the graphs. Two-way ANOVA was performed to assess experiments with a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial design (for instance, when mice from 2 different strains were vaccinated with eitherAS01 or PBS + Ag). When 2- way ANOVA is performed, the interaction test addresses the question whether the effect of treatment (for instance vaccination) is the same in both conditions tested (for instance 2 differentmouse strains). If the p-value is < 0.05, then the treatment has different effects in the two conditions. Statistical signi cance: * p< 0.05, ** 0.0001.Synergistic effects in AS01 innate immune response M Coccia et al. 12 npj Vaccines (2017) 25 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine DevelopmentData availability Transcriptomics data are available on GEO database with access number GSE98322.
