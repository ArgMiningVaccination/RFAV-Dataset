She has extensive knowledge relating to anxiety and depression, chronic fatigue, auto-immune conditions, acute and chronic pain in groups of all ages. She has considerable expertise in getting to the core of a problem and unraveling it. Dr. Strass specializes in working with creative geniuses and artists of all types with performance anxiety and depression. She loves helping professional musicians, dancers, speakers, and scientists find their voice, give 100% in their performances, and feel emotionally connected. Dr. Strass offers sincerity, acute perception, and an excellent understanding of human nature and of energy healing. Her gifts include integrity, intelligence, and compassion, not to mention a quick wit. Dr. Strass has walked a long and winding road in her life. She comes from a very long line of survivors. Her family tree is rooted in Eastern European and Ukrainian Jewish culture. It is filled with musicians, lawyers, scholars, and scientists. She was raised to live with an attitude of resilience and to practice mental flexibility. She brings this with her and shares it wherever she goes. Initially trained as a classical singer and guitarist, she changed course and earned her bachelor's degree in Russian. She then mastered the science of computer programming, working with servers and user interfaces. However, as none of these vocations satisfied her need to be of service, she went back to school for Acupuncture and Chinese Herbs and has remained focused on holistic health since that time. Her services are available in English, Spanish, and Russian. Nationally certified in Acupuncture and Chinese Herbs, Dr. Strass is an excellent communicator with cross-cultural skills, speaking three languages. She excels at helping people through all sorts of challenges and transitions. Dr. Strass is a member of the following organizations: [American Association of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (AAAOM)](http://www.aaaomonline.org/) [Maryland Acupuncture Society (MAS)](http://www.maryland-acupuncture.org/) [National Acupuncture Detoxification Association (NADA)](http://www.acudetox.com/) [Zero Balancing Health Association (ZBHA)](http://www.zerobalancing.com/) [National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM)](http://www.nccaom.org/) Acupuncture is very potent medicine, suitable for everyone. It is useful for specific physical or mental concerns and for general wellness. With regular visits: Feel more in control of your life Stay well when others get sick Increase vitality and stamina Improve your overall outlook Recover more gracefully from injury, surgery, and illness Levels of Treatment Physical: Holistic medicine treats the mind and body as one. Pain in the body can be more than structural. It frequently has an emotional component. Acupuncture treats the root of the pain as well as symptoms. Mental/Emotional: Anxiety, anger, sadness, worry, and grief are the biggest concerns in today's world. When qi is balanced and restored to healthy function, life becomes joyful again. Spirit: Spiritual health has always been seen as the highest level of treatment. It remains the cornerstone of Holistic Medicine to this day. Chinese Herbs are frequently used with acupuncture with the same principles. A Chinese Medicine Herbalist takes the use of herbs to a new level by creating a decoction. Decoctions contain combinations of different parts of plants, minerals, and/or animals to attain a desirable outcome. The past 50 years of research in China has demonstrated that using western pharmaceuticals with Chinese herbs results in a better prognosis in less time, with fewer medications and fewer side effects.

I may use acupuncture, moxibustion, Chinese herbs, and/or nutrition to support you in your wellness. The First Visit lasts about 90 minutes. We talk about your health history and lifestyle.
