CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications M-M-RvaxPro is indicated f or simultaneou s vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella in individ uals f rom 12 months of age (see section 4.2). M-M-RvaxPro can be admini stered to inf ants f rom 9 months of age under special circumstances (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). For use in measles outb r eaks, or f or post - exposure vaccination, or, for use in prev iously unvaccinated individuals older than 9 months who are in contact with susceptible pr egnan t women, and persons likely to be susceptible to mumps and rubella, see section 5.1. M-M-RvaxPro is t o be used on the basis of of f icial recommendations. 34.2 Po sology and method of administration Posology Individ uals 12 months o f age or older: Individuals 12 months or older should receive one dose at an elected date. A second dose may be administered a t least 4 weeks af ter the f irst dose in accordance with of f i cial recommendation. The second dose is intended f or i n dividuals who d id not respond to th e fir st dose for any reason. Inf ants between 9 and 12 months of age: Immunogenicity and saf ety data show that M -M-RvaxPro can be administered to inf ants between 9 an d 12 months of age, in accordance with of f icia l recomme ndations or whe n an early protectio n is considered necessary (e.g. day- care, outbreak situations, or travel to a region with high prevalence of measles). Such inf ants should be revaccinated at 12 to 15 months of age . An additional dose with a meas les-conta ining vaccine should be consider ed accor ding to of f icial recommendations (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). Inf ants below 9 months of age: No data on the ef f icacy and saf ety of M -M-RvaxPro f or use in childre n below 9 months of age are currently available. Metho d of adminis tration The vaccin e is to b e injected intramuscularly (IM) or subcutaneously (SC). The preferred injection sites are the anter o lateral area of the thigh in younger children and the deltoi d area in older children, adolescents, and adults. Th e vaccine sh ould be administere d subcuta neously in patients with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder. For precautions to be taken b efore handling or administering the medicinal product, and f or instructions on reconstitution of t he medicinal pro duct before administration, see section 6.6. DO NOT INJECT INTRAVASCULARLY. 4.3 Contraindications H ypersensitivity to any measl e s, mumps, or rubella vaccine, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 , including neomycin (see sec tions 2 and 4.4). Pregna ncy . Furthermore, pregnancy shou ld be avoided f or 1 month f ollowing vaccination (see section 4.6). Vaccination should be postponed during any illness with f ever > 38.5 \u00b0C. Active untreated tu berculosis. Children under treatment f or t uberculosis h ave no t experienced exacerbation of the disease when immuni s ed with live measles virus vaccine. No studies have been reported to date on the ef f ect o f measles virus vaccines on children with untreated tuberculosis. Blood dyscrasias, leuka emi a, lymphomas o f any ty pe, or other malignant neopl asms aff ecting the haematopoietic and lymphatic systems. Current immunosuppressive therapy (including high dose s of corticosteroids). M -M-RvaxPro is not contraindic ated in individuals who are re ceiving top ical or low -dose pa ren teral corticosteroids ( e.g. f or asthma prophylaxis or replacement therapy). 4Severe h umoral or cellular (primary or acquired) immunodef icien cy , e.g. severe combined immunodeficiency, agammaglob AIDS or symptomat ic HIV inf ction or an ag e-specific CD4+ T - lymphocyte percent age in children below 12 months: CD4+ < 25% ; children between 12-35 36 -59 m onths: CD4+ < 15% (see section 4.4). In severely im munocompromised individuals in adv ertently vaccinated with body encephalitis, pneumonitis, and f atal outcome as a direct consequence of disseminated measles v accine virus inf ection have been reported. Family hi story of congenital or heredit ary immunodeficiency, unl ess the immune competence of the potenti al vaccine recipient is demonstrated. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceabilit y In order to imp rove the traceability of biological medicinal pr oducts, the name and the batch number of the adminis ter ed product should be clearly recorde d. As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in case of rare anaphylactic reactions f ollowing the administra tion of the vaccine (see secti on 4.8). Adults and ado lescents with a history of allergies may potentially be at inc r eased risk of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions. Close monitoring is recommended f ollowing vaccination f or the early signs of such re actions. Since live measles v acc ine and live mumps vaccine are produced i n chick embryo ce ll culture, persons with a history of anaphyla c tic, anaphylactoid, or other imm ediate reactions (e.g. hives, sw elling of the mouth and throa t, dif f iculty breathing, hypotension, or shock) subsequ en t to egg ingestion may be at an enhanced risk of immediate -type hypers ensitivi ty reactions. The p otentia l risk-to-benef it ra tio shoul d be care f ully evalu ate d bef ore consi dering vaccination in such ca ses. Due caution should be employed in administration of M-M-RvaxPro to pe rsons with individual or f amily history o f co nvulsions, or a histo r y of cerebral injury. The physician should be alert to the temperature elevation that may occur f ollowing vaccination (see section 4.8). I nf ants from 9 to 12 months of a ge vaccinated with a measles-containing va ccine during measl es outbrea ks or f o r other reason s may f ail t o respond to the vac cine due to the pr esence of c irculating antibo dies of maternal origin and/o r immaturity of the immune system (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). Thrombocytopenia T his vaccine should be given subcutan eous ly to individuals with thrombocytopen ia or any coagulati on disorder because bleeding may occur f ollowing an intramuscular ad m inistration in these individuals. I ndividuals with curren t thrombocytopenia may develop mo re severe thrombocytopenia f ollowing vac In addition, individuals ytopenia with the f irst dose of M-M-RvaxPro (or its component vac c ines) may develop thrombocytopenia w ith repeat dos es. Serologic status may be evaluated to determine whether or not additional dose s of vaccine are needed. The potentia l risk -to-benef it r ati o should be caref ully evaluated bef ore considering vaccination in such cases (see section 4.8). Other Vaccination m a y be considered in patients with selecte d immune deficiencies where the bene f its outweigh the risks (asymptomatic def iciency disea ses). Immuno com promised patients who have no contraind ication f or this vac cination (see se ction 4.3) may not respond as well as im munocompetent patients; theref ore , some of th ese patie nts may acquire 5measles, mum ps, or rubella in case of contact, despite appropriate vac cine administration. These patients shou ld be monitored car efully f or signs of m parotitis , and rubella. Vac cination with M -M-RvaxPro may not result in protection in all vaccinees. Transmission Ex cretion of small amounts of the live atten u ated rubella virus f rom the nose or throat has o ccurred in the majority of susceptib le individuals 7 to 28 days af ter vaccin ation. There is no con f irmed evidence to indicate that such virus is transmitted to susc e ptible persons who are in contact wi th the vaccinated individuals. Consequently, transmissi on through close personal contact, w hile accepted as a theoretical possibili ty, is not regarded as a signif icant risk; however, transmission of the rubella vaccine virus to inf ants via breast milk has been d o cumented without any evidence of clinical diseas e (see section 4.6). There are no r epor ts of transmission of the more atten uated Enders' Edmon sto n strain of measles virus or the Jeryl Lynn strain of mumps virus f rom vaccinees to susceptible contac ts. Sodium This medici nal product co ntains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 milligrams ) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'. Potassium This medici nal product contains less t han 1 mmol potas sium (39 milligrams ) per essent 'potassium -f ree'. Sorbitol (E roduct contains 14. 5 milligrams of sorbitol per dos e. The additive eff ect of concomitantly admin istered pro ducts containin g sorbitol (or f ructose) and dietary in take of sorbitol (or f ructose) shou ld be taken into ac count. Interference with laborator y tes ts: see section 4.5. 4.5 Interactio n wi th other medicinal products and ot her forms of interac tion Immune gl obulin Immune globulin (IG) is not to be given concomitantly with M -M-RvaxPro. Administrat i on of immune globulins concomitantly with M -M-RvaxPro m ay interf ere with the expected immun e re sponse. Vaccination should be de fe rred f or at least 3 months f ollowin g blood or plasma transf usions, or administration of immune of measles, -containing blood products, including immune globul in preparations, should be avoid ed within 1 month af te r a dose of M -M-RvaxPro unless considered to be essential. Laboratory tests It has been re ported that live attenuated measles, mumps and rubella virus vaccines given individually may result in a t empor ary depression of tuberculin sk in sensitivity. Theref ore, if a tuber culin test is to be done, it should be administered either any time befor e, s imultaneously w ith, or 4 to 6 weeks af ter vaccination with M -M-RvaxPro. Use with other vaccines Currently no s pecif ic studies have been condu ct ed on the concomitan t use of M -M-RvaxPro and other vaccines. However, since M -M-RvaxPro h as been shown to ha v e safety and immun ogenicity prof iles similar to the previous formulation of the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merc k & Co., Inc., experie nce with this v accin e can be considered. 6 Published clinical data sup p ort concomitant ad m inistration of the previous f ormulation of the measles, mumps and rubell a vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co ., Inc. with other childhood vaccina tions, including b with H epatitis B vaccine), and VAR (varicella). M -M-RvaxPro should be given concomitantly at sepa rate in jection sites, or one month b ef ore or af ter adminis tration of othe r liv e virus vaccines. Based on clinical studi e s with the quadrivalent m e asles, mumps, rube lla and varicella vaccine and with the previous f ormula tion of the combined measles, mumps and rub ella vaccine manufactured by M erck & Co., Inc., M -M-RvaxPro can b e giv en simultaneously (but at separate i njection sites) with Prevenar an d/or hepatitis A va ccine. In these clinical studies, it was demonstrated t hat the immune responses were unaf f e cted and that the overall safety pro fi les of the administe red vaccines we re similar. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy an d lactation Pregnancy Pregnan t women should not be vaccin ated with M-M-RvaxPro. Studies have not been con ducted with M -M-RvaxPro in pregnant women. I t is not known whether M-M-RvaxPro can cause f oeta l harm when adm inistered to a pr e gnant woman or can af f ect reproduction capacity. However, f oetal damage has no t been docu mented w hen mea sles or mum ps vaccines have been given to pregnant women. Althoug h a theo retical risk cannot be excluded , no cases of congen ital rub ella syndrome hav e been report e d in more than 3500 sus ceptible women w ho were unknow ingly in early stages of pregnan cy when vaccinated with a rubella- containing vaccine . Theref ore, in advertent vaccination of unknowingl y pregnant measles -, mumps -, or rubella -conta ining vaccin es should not be a reaso n f or terminati o n of pregnancy . Pregn ancy should be a voided f or 1 month f ollowing vaccina tio n. Women who intend to become pregna nt shoul d be advised to delay . Breast-f eeding Studies h ave shown that breast- f eeding post p artum women vaccinated with live attenuated rubella vacc ines may secrete t he virus in breast milk and transmit it to breast -f ed i nf ants. In the inf cal evid ence of rubella inf ection, n one had symptomatic disease. It is not k nown whether me asles or mumps vaccine virus is secreted in human milk; theref ore, caution should be exercised when M -M-RvaxPro is administered t o a breast - f eeding woman. Fertility M-M-RvaxPro has not been evaluate d in f ertility studies . 4.7 Effects on ab ility to drive and use machines No studies on the ef f ects on the ability to dri ve and u se ma chines have been pe rf ormed . M-M-RvaxPro to or negligible inf luence on the a bility to drive and use ma chines. 4.8 Undesirab le effects a. Summa ry of the safety prof ile In clinical trials, M -M-RvaxPro was administered to 1965 childre n (see section 5.1), and the general saf ety prof ile was comparable to the previous f ormulat ion of t he measles, mumps and rub ella vaccine manuf actu red by Merck & Co., Inc. 7 In a clinical trial, 752 children received M-M-RvaxPro, eit her intramuscu larly or subcutaneously. The general sa f ety pr of ile of either adm inistration routes were comparable, althoug h injection site reaction s were less f requent in the IM group (15.8%) compared with the SC gro up (25 .8%). All advers e reactions wer e evaluated in 1940 children. Among the se child ren, th e vacci ne-related adverse reactions, summarised in section b, were ob se rved in individuals f o ll owing vaccination w ith M-M-RvaxPro (excludi ng isolated reports with f reque ncy < 0.2%). In comparison to the f irst dos e , a second do se of M -M-RvaxPro is not associated with an increase in the incidence and severity of clini cal sym pt oms including those su ggesti ve of hypersensi tivity reaction . Addit ionally, other adverse r eactions with p ost-marketing u se of M -M-RvaxPro and/o r in clinical st udies an d post -marketi ng use of pre vious f o rmulations of monovalent and of the measles, mumps and rub ella vaccines manufa ctured b y Merck & Co ., Inc. without regard to c ausality or f requency ar e available and are summarised in section b. The f req uency of these adverse events is qualif ied as \"not known \" when it cannot be est imated bas ed on the available data. These data were reported based on mo re than 400 million doses d istribute d worldwide. The most common adverse reacti ons repo rted with the us e of M-M-RvaxPro were: f ever (38.5 \u00b0C or high er); injection site reactions incl uding p ain , swelling and eryth ema. b.

Descriptio n of select ed advers e reactions Aseptic meningitis Cases of asepti c meningitis have been reported f ol lowing m eas les, mumps and rubella vaccination. Although a causal relationship between other strains of mumps vaccine and aseptic meningitis has been shown , there is no eviden ce to link Jeryl Lynn vaccine to asepti c meningitis. Encephalitis and encephalitis, pneumoni tis, and f atal out come as a direct consequence of disseminated m easles vaccine virus inf ection have been re port ed (see section 4.3); disseminated mumps and rubella vaccine virus inf ection has o been reported. Suba cute sclerosi ng pa nencephalit is There is no evidence th at me asles vaccine can cause SSPE. There have b een reports of SSPE in children who did not hav e a history of inf ection with wild -type measl es but did rece ive measles vaccine. Som e of these cases may h ave resulted f rom unrecogni sed measle s in the f irst year of lif e or possibly f rom the measles vaccinati on. The results of a retrospective case-control led study conducted by the US Centers f or Dis ease Control an d Prevention suggest tha t the overall ef f ect o f measles vaccine has been to protect against SSPE by prevent ing measles with its inh erent risk of SSPE . Arthralgia and/or arthritis Arthralgia a nd/o r arthritis (usually transient and rarely chronic), and polyneuritis are f eatures of inf ection with wild - type rubella and vary in f requency and severity w ith age and s ex, being greatest in adult f emales and le ast in prepubertal children. Follow ing vaccinat ion in children, reactions in joints are generally uncommon (0 - 3%) and of brief duration. In women, incidence rates f or arthritis and arthralgi a are gener ally hi gher t han those seen in children (12 -20%), and t he reactions tend to be more marked and of long er duration. Symptoms may persist f or a matter of months or on rare occasions f or years. In adolescent girls, the reactions appear to be interm ediate in i ncidenc e betw een those seen in 9 children and adult women . Even in older women (35 -45 years) , these reac tions are generally well tolerated and rarely interf ere with normal activities. Chronic arthritis Chronic arthritis has been associated with w ild-type ru bella i nf ecti on and has been related to persistent viru s and/or viral antigen isolated f ro m body t issu es. Only rarely have vaccine recipients developed chronic joint symptoms. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporti ng suspec ted adverse reactions af ter authori sation of the medicinal product is importa nt. It allows continued monitoring of the b enef it/risk balance of the medicinal product. Hea lthcare prof ess ionals are asked to repo rt any suspected adver se reactio ns via the natio nal reporti ng system listed in Appendix V . 4.9 Overdose Administration of a higher than recommended dose of M-M-RvaxPro was reported rarely and the adverse reaction prof i le was comparable to that observed with the recomm ended dose of M-M-RvaxPro. 5. PHA RMA COLOG ICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Viral vaccine, code J07BD52 Evaluation of immunogenicity and clini cal ef f icacy A co m parative study in 1279 subjects who received M-M-RvaxPro or the previous f ormulati on (manu f act ured with human mumps and rubella vaccine manuf actured by Merck & Co., Inc. demonstrated similar immunogenicity and saf ety betwee n the 2 products. Clinical stu dies of 284 tripl e seronegative children, 11 months to 7 years of age, demonstrated that the previous f ormulat ion of the meas les, mumps and rubella vaccine manufactured b y Merck & Co., In c. is h ighly immuno genic and generally well tolerated. In these stud ies, a single inj ection of the vaccine induced measl es haemagg lutination - inhibition (HI) antibodies in 95%, mum ps neutralising antibodies in 96%, and rubella HI antibodies in 9 of suscept ible persons. Evaluation of immun ogen icity in children f rom 9 to 12 months of age a t the time of f irst dose A clinical study was con ducted with the quadrivalent measles, mumps, rubella and va ricella vaccine manuf act ured by Merck & Co., I nc., administered with a 2 -dose sch edule, the doses being given 3 months apart in 1,620 healthy subjec ts f rom 9 to 12 months of age at th e time of f irst dose . The saf ety prof ile post -dose 1 an d 2 was general ly comparable f or all ag e cohorts. In the Ful l An alysis Set (v acci nated subjects regardless of their antibody titre at baseline), high seroprotection rates of > 99% were elicited to mum ps and rub ella post-dose 2, regardless of the age of t he vaccinee at the f irst dose. Af ter 2 doses, the seroprotec tion rates agains t me asles were 98. 1% wh en the f irst dose was given at 11 months com pared to 98.9% when the f irst dose was given at 12 months (non-inf er iori ty study objective met). Af ter two do ses, the seropr otection rates against m easles were 94.6% when the f irst dose w as given at 9 months c ompared to 98 .9% when the f irst dose was give n at 12 months (non -inf er iority study objective not met). The seropr otec tion rates to measles, mumps and rubella for the Full Analysis Set are given in Table 1. 10Table 1: Seroprotectio n Ra tes to Measles , Mum ps and Ru bella 6 Week s Post -Dose 1 and 6 We eks Post-Dose 2 of the rivalent measles, mumps, rubella an d varicell a vacc ine manufactured by Merck & Co. , Inc. - Full A nalysis Set Valence (seropro tection level)Time pointDose 1 at 9 months / Dose 2 at 12 mont hs N = 52 7Dose 1 at 11 months / Dose 2 at 14 months N = 480Dose 1 at 12 months / Dose 2 at 15 months N = 46 6 S eroprotection rates t mumps and rubella were comparable s all age categories, while the GMTs against measles were lower in subjects who received the f irst dose at 9 months of age as compared to subjects w ho r eceived the f irst dose at 11 o r 12 months o f age. A co mparat ive study in 752 subjects who received M-M-RvaxPro either by intramuscular route or subcutaneous route demonstrated a similar immunogenicity prof ile between both administration routes. The ef f i cacy of the components of th e previ ous f o rmulatio n of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine manufactur ed by Merck & Co., Inc. was established in a series of double - blind controlled f ield trials, which demonstrated a high degree of protective eff icacy a f fo rded by the individual vacc ine comp onent s. These studies also established that seroconversion in respon se to vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella paralleled protection f rom these diseases. Post- exposure vaccination Vaccination of individuals exposed to wild - type measles may provi de some prot ection if the vaccine can be administered within 72 hou rs af ter exposure. If , however, the vaccine is given a f ew days before exposure, substantial protection may be af f orded. There is no conclusive eviden ce that vaccination of individ uals rece ntly exposed to wild - type mumps or wild - type rubella will provide protection. Ef fectiveness More than 400 million doses of the previous f ormulation of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. hav e been distributed worldwide (1978 to 2003). Wides pread use of a 2 - dose vaccination schedule i n the United States and countries such as Finland and Sweden has led to a > 99% reduction in the incidence of each of the 3 targeted diseases. Non-pregnan t adolescent and adult f e males Vacc ination of susceptible non - pregnant adolescent and adult f emales o f childbearing age with live attenuated rubella virus vaccine is indicated if certain precautions are observed (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). Vaccinating susc eptible postpubertal f ema les conf er l protection against subsequently acquiring rubella inf ection during pregnancy, which, in turn, prevents inf ection of the f oetus and consequent congenital rubella injury. 11 Previously unvaccinated individua ls older than 9 months who are in contac t with susc eptible pregnant women should receive live attenuated r ubella - containing vaccine (such as M -M-RvaxPro or a monovalent rubella vaccine) to reduce the risk of exposure of the pregnant woman. Individuals lik ely t o be susceptible to mumps and rubella M-M-RvaxPro is pref erred f or vaccination of persons likely to b e susceptible to mumps and rubella. Individuals who require vaccination against measles can receive M -M-RvaxPro regardless of their immune status to m umps or rubella if a monovalen t measles vacc ine is not readily available. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non- clinical studies have not been conducted. 6.
