Recommended Reviews [Learn more about reviews.](https://www.yelp.com/reviews-trust-link-tree?l=en_US) Overall rating 5 stars 4 stars 3 stars 2 stars 1 star - 4/2/2021 Dr. Ayleen has always been my go-to for every alignment in my body. I've know her for over ten years and she has always healed me. From dislocating my knee, post pregnancy lower back pains to ankle pains - she has rescued me. I love how caring, understanding and amazing she is. She has the magic touch and very kind. She's definitely an angel and I am really grateful that I met her. Now that I'm married and with a preteen son; she takes care of my family's need. This makes me very happy I highly recommend her to anyone who needs some body healing. She is not your typical chiropractor... she is an amazing healer! - 11/4/2019 Dr. Ayleen is a very in-tune soul. During my Reiki sessions and classes, she would speak the eloquence of the universe to me, like it were notes being strung on a guitar. Her observations are on point, and the aura she gives off is encapsulating and refreshing. Going to her for my Reiki attunnments was the best choice of my life! I can't thank her enough for all of the insight and perspective she has bestowed upon me. Thank you so much Dr! - 4/13/2021 Dr Ayleen has wonderful healing hands. I love how she makes each individual feel welcome. I have been seeing her for 10yrs now and always leave her office feeling fabulous. - 1/14/2019 Dr. Ayleen is AMAZING. My husband, his family, and I all go to her. She really listens to what your feeling and finds exactly where the source of the problem is. I actually don't even like the idea of going to a chiropractor because I hate neck cracking, but Dr. Ayleen puts me at such ease that I am able to relax enough to fix my neck when it is in pain. I appriciate all of the years I have been going to her! She brings her warm personality and extensive knowledge to every appointment. I would recommened her to everyone I know. - 1/16/2017 I've been to 6 chiropractors, and Dr. Ayleen is by far the best I have ever been to. I've always had knees and feet that pointed in opposite directions, and I thought it was just me. She not only told me what it was, she fixed it easily, and told me how to avoid aggravating it. I used to need monthly adjustments in good times, and thrice weekly in bad times. Ayleen has made it so I only need to go in when I have some issue (fall down, hurt my hand, car accident, etc). After getting a referral from my mom and sister, now my husband sees her, my other sister, two friends, and I won't stop referring people to her! - 7/17/2012 After working for a few chiropractors I am a bit picky on who gets to work on my back. Dr Ayleen is amazing. I am one of those tough people to adjust. My muscles are just argumentative! She seems to calm them down and adjust me with no issues. I even have my husband going to her as well. And it is impossible to get him to go anywhere so that is saying something! I'd love to recommend everyone to her, but I also want to keep her to myself so she will be available. - 6/16/2012First to Review I'm a Bay Area native currently living in Boston, but any time I come back to California Dr. Ayleen is practically my first stop. She always hones in on exactly what the problem is, sometimes as soon as I walk into the room. Her whole-body approach to chiropractic medicine combined with energy work throughout the process always leaves me feeling less sore and more rejuvenated than just a simple bone tweak could accomplish. I would highly recommend Dr. Ayleen Augustine for your chiropractic, as well as spiritual healing, needs. - 7/2/2012 I have known some really incredible chiropractors in my time, including a dear family friend, but I have never experienced the level of care that Dr. Ayleen provides. Far beyond the usual Chiropractic treatment, Dr. Ayleen treats the whole person, listening carefully to both the patient's spoken word, and their body. Her combination of deep tissue work with Chiropractic adjustment ensures that the properly aligned parts stay where they should be, and (in my experience, and that of others I know) recovery time is decreased. Dr. Ayleen also combines energy work and her Terragetic healing modalities to bring health and vitality to the whole being. She is an amazing healer and person; to visit Dr. Ayleen is to give yourself the gift of exceptional treatment and superlative health. - 7/25/2014 I have been treated periodically for the past two years with Dr. Ayleen, she is always insightful, timely and her treatments are incredibly successful. I have had DC care off and on for 25 years and for me Dr. Ayleen is the best most comprehensive evaluator, who treats the whole body and her deep tissue work, insights and advice require fewer return visits. This RN recommends her fully, - 6/17/2012 I have been using Chiropractic to manage my growing old issues for over 40 years. Until Dr. Ayleen, the treatments were twist, turn, extend and bye. Max time usually about 10 minutes for lots of cash. Enter Dr. Augustine, on referral from a family member. She spends the first 20 minutes doing a massage to loosen me up, then adjusts what needs to be. She is very warm and loving and always willing to take the extra step to make you feel great. I know every one's issues are their own, but I cannot recommend Dr. Ayleen enough. She is our family's primary care Doctor and has become a necessity to my well being.
