Raimondo 2020 TAX EXPENDITURES REPORT Office of Revenue Analysis Issue Date: February 13, 2020 2020 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 2 Acknowledgements The 2020 Tax Expenditures Report was prepared at the request of Paul L. Dion, Ph.D., Chief of the Office of Revenue Analysis in accordance with Rhode Island General Law Chapter 44-48.1. Bethany Scanlon, Principal Economic and Policy Analyst in the Office of Revenue Analysis was the proj ect leader for the production and writing of this report, under the guidance of Mr. Dion. Ms. Scanlon was assisted by Stephanie Hume, Senior Economic and Policy Analyst in the Office of Revenue Analysis, Emily Fazio, Senior Economic and Policy Analyst in the Office of Revenue Analysis, and Madiha Zaffou, Principal Economic and Policy Analyst, in the Office of Revenue Analysis. Much of the information needed to derive the estimates was provided by the Rhode Island Division of Taxation, under the direction of Neena Sinha Savage, State Tax Administrator. The compilation of the data that was provided to the Office of Revenue Analysis was due to the tremendous efforts of Tracy Wunder, Data Analyst III in the Division of Taxation. Tracy was assisted in this task by Michael Canole, Associate Director, Revenue Services; Rahul Sarathy, Chief of Examination, Donna Dube, Credits and Incentives; Chief Analyst I, Operati ons; Leo Lebeuf, Chief of Tax Processing Services, Assessment and Review; Patrick Gengarella, Chief of Tax Processing Services, Field Audit Services; and Richard Coia, Principal Revenue Agent, Corporation and Business Tax and their staffs. In addition, Maureen McDaniel, DMV Project Manager, in the Division of Motor Vehicles; and her staff was instrumental in the providing specific information pertaining to motor vehicle tax expenditures. Production of this report would not have been possible without Maureen's help. The Office of Revenue Analysis is appreciative of the efforts made by the Division of Taxation and the Division of Motor Vehicles to provide us with the best information available at the time this report was written. 2020 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 3 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE SUMMARY .............................................................................................. 4 FOREWORD ................................................................................................................... 10 INTRODUCTION........................................................................................................... 11 INTERPRETING THE REP ORT ................................................................................ 14 LAWS CHANGES THAT IM PACT TAX EXPENDITURE S ................................... 26 SUMMARY RESULTS BY T AX EXPENDITURE ITEM ........................................ 34 SUMMARY RESULTS BY T AX TYPE ...................................................................... 44 DETAIL OF TAX EXPEND ITURE ITEMS ............................................................... 62 CREDITS ......................................................................................................................... 62 DEDUCTIONS .............................................................................................................. 139 EXCLUSIONS ............................................................................................................... 182 EXEMPTIONS .............................................................................................................. 213 MODIFICATIONS ....................................................................................................... 349 OTHER ITEMS ............................................................................................................ 396 PREFERENTIAL TAX RAT ES 408 TAX ABATEM ENTS ................................................................................................... 413 TAX DEFERRALS THE REPORT ................................ 423 CURRENT APPENDIX INCENTIVES EVALUATION ............ 428 APPENDIX C: DEFUNCT TAX EXPENDITURE ITEM S FOUND IN RHODE ISL AND LAW ............................................................................................................................... 432 I. Executive Summary 2020 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 4 Executive Summary Tax expenditures are legal mandates that provide preferential tax treatment to taxpayers that meet the requirements of the mandates. The 2020 Tax Expenditu res Report contains information on 232 tax expenditure items enacted in the Rhode Island General Law s as of January 1, 2020, however not all items were in effect for the years reported . For tax expenditure items that did have reliable data from which to e stimate revenue forgone, the estimated total revenue forgone was $ 2.13 billion in 2016 and $2.28 billion in 201 7. The 2020 Tax Expenditures Report continues to use the reliability index that was developed in the 2010 Tax Expenditures Report . The Index of Reliability is shown below: Index of Reliability Interpretation Level One (1) Estimate is from actual Rhode Island tax return data Level Two (2) Estimate is extrapolated from Rhode Island source data Level Three (3) Estimate is from Rhode Island tax simulation model Level Four (4) Estimate is federal/national data scaled for Rhode Island Level Five (5) No reliable data exists from which to derive an estimate The following table shows the number of tax expenditure items by tax expenditure category, the revenue forgone by tax expenditure category, and the average reliability index level by tax expenditure category for 2016: Summary Table by Tax Expenditure Category for 2016 Tax Expenditure Category Number of Items in Each Category Tax Year 2016 Revenue Forgone1 Average Reliability Index Level Credits 34 $ 260,502,974 1.1 Deductions 23 241,761,901 2.6 Exclusions 25 213,622,700 4.2 Exemptions 104 1,364,886,046 3.6 Modifications 30 26,625,720 1.6 Other Items 6 --- 5.0 1 Revenue forgone amounts are a mix of fiscal year and tax year periodicities depending on the tax expenditure category in question.

Exemptions also had the highest number of items for which no reliable data exists from which to estimate revenue forgone with 43, or 41.3 percent of all Exemptions. Finally, Exemptions are also the tax expenditure category with the largest amount of re venue forgone at $1.36 billion or 64.0% of the estimated total revenue forgone for 201 6. The tax expenditure category with the smallest amount of revenue forgone was Tax Abatements at $1,827,927 or 0.09% of the estimated total revenue forgone. The revenu e forgone for each of the tax expenditure items is assigned a reliability index level on a scale of one to five, with one meaning the calculated revenue forgone is the most reliable possible and five meaning that it is not possible to calculate the revenue forgone for the tax expenditure item. A total of 82 or 36.0 percent of all 2016 tax expenditure items received a reliability index level score of one, while 7 8 or 34.2 percent of the 2 29 tax expenditure items were assigned a reliability index score of fi ve.

Foreword 2020 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 10 Foreword The 2020 Tax Expenditures Report generally uses data for 201 6 as its base year and includes estimates of forgone revenue for 2016 through 2021. The year reference can be either calendar year or fiscal year and is dependent on the tax expenditure item. For example, the tax expenditure a mount for the exclusion of the biodiesel portion of a blended gallon of diesel fuel is reported on a fiscal year basis for 2016 through 2021 while the tax expenditure amount for the tax credit received for the provision of accommodations under Americans wi th Disabilities Act is reported on a calendar year basis for 201 6 through 2021. The Office of Revenue Analysis (ORA) has tried to make it clear throughout the report when a tax expenditure amount is for a fiscal year versus a calendar year and when a summ ary tax expenditure amount is provided by tax expenditure category or by tax type a note is provided that breaks out the tax expenditure amount by fiscal and calendar year. Whenever more recent data was available for subsequent years, be it for fiscal yea rs or tax years, the latest data was included in the report rather than an estimate. It should be noted that more recent data may have become available for some tax expenditure items during the preparation of this report but is not reflected in this repor t. The 2018 Tax Expenditures Report included information on tax expenditure items for Tax Years 201 4 through 201 9, with Tax Year 2014 as its base tax year. Technically, the 2020 Tax Expenditures Report is mandated to provide information on all tax expenditure items in effect on January 1, 2019, as well as an estimate of forgone revenue for 20 20 and 2021. For a complete and more accurate picture for 201 6 through 2018 forgone revenue to be provided, ORA reported current data or an updated estimate of forgone revenue as appropriate. As always, constructive comments are welcome and any errors or omissions in the report are the responsibility of the Chief of the Office of Revenue Analysis. Paul L. Dion, Ph.D. Chief, Office of Revenue Analysis Rhode Island Department of Revenue III. Introduction 2020 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 11 Introduction Purpose of the Tax Expenditures Report The purpose of the Tax Expenditures Report is to provide information on the cost of tax preference items that are mandated under Rhode Island law, federal law, or other legal mandates. Tax expenditure items are not subject to the same public scrutiny as spending appropriations that are made through the budget process. Oftentimes , the estima ted cost of a tax expenditure item is made only once \u2014 at the time it is passed into law. The Tax Expenditures Report provides for an accounting of the cost of tax expenditure items on an ongoing basis. By providing this cost information, the Tax Expendi tures Report allows these expenditures to be assessed on par with appropriated expenditures. Absent a Tax Expenditures Report , it would be extremely difficult to assess the cost effectiveness of a tax expenditure vis -\u00e0-vis an appropriated expenditure. As the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities notes, tax expenditures are simply \"spending by another name.\" 5 Current Rhode Island Law on Tax Expenditures Reporting Rhode Island General Laws Chapter 44- 48.1 - Tax Expenditure Reporting6 Rhode Island General Laws \u00a7 44- 48.1- 1(a) mandates that the Chief of the Office of Revenue Analysis deliver to the General Assembly by the second Tuesday in January of each even numbered year a tax expenditure report. The tax expenditure report must include the minimum inform ation for 100.0 percent of the tax expenditures in place on January 1 of the odd numbered year preceding the report's publication. Thus, the 2020 Tax Expenditures Report covers the tax expenditures that were in place on January 1, 2019 . Rhode Island General Law s \u00a7 44- 48.1- 1(b) defines a tax expenditure as \"any tax credit, deduction, exemption, exclusion, credit preferential tax rate, tax abatement, and tax deferral that provides preferential treatment to selected taxpayers.\" The term \"credit preferential tax rate\" is not defined in the statute. The Chief of the Office of Revenue Analysis has chosen to interpret this item to mean a \"modification\" or \"preferential tax rat e\" and reports on each of these tax expenditure items separately. The Office of Revenue Analysis has determined that as of January 1, 201 9 there were 230 tax expenditure items in effect in 2016 7 either \"directly through Rhode Island General Law s or consti tutional provisions or indirectly through adoption of other tax codes.\" Rhode Island General Law s \u00a7 44- 48.1- 1(c) delineates the information on each tax expenditure item that must be included in the report. This information includes: (1) the legal refer ence of the tax expenditure items, \"including whether the tax expenditure is the result of a federal or state constitutional, judicial, or statutory mandate;\" (2) the actual amount of revenue forgone or an estimate for the calendar year in which the report is published and the year following the report's publication, and an index of the reliability of each estimate that ranges in value from one to five, 5 Levitis, Jason, Nicholas Johnson, and Jeremy Koulish, Promoting State Budget Accountability Through Tax Expenditure Reporting. Center on Budget and Policy Priorities: Washington, D.C., April 2009, page 5. 6 A full copy of the statute governing tax expenditure reporting is contained in Appendix A. III. Introduction 2020 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 12 with level one being the most reliable; (3) the identification of the beneficiaries of the tax expenditur e by \"number, income, class and industry;\" (4) a comparison of the Rhode Island tax expenditure items to tax expenditure items of the other New England states, but particularly Connecticut and Massachusetts; (5) \"the data source(s) and analysis methodology \" for each tax expenditure item estimate; and (6) \"identification of similar taxpayers or industries\" that do not benefit from the tax expenditure item. To the greatest extent possible , the Office of Revenue Analysis has tried to comply with each of these informational mandates. Rhode Island General Law s \u00a7 44- 48.1- 1(d) requires that each report contain a section comprised of recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the tax expenditures report as a tax policy tool. The recommendations are to be acc ompanied with an identification of the resources needed to implement the recommendations and an estimate of the costs associated with the recommendations. Rhode Island General Laws Chapter 44- 48.2 - Rhode Island Economic Development Tax Incentives Evaluat ion Act of 20138 On July 11, 2013, Rhode Island General Laws Chapter 44- 48.2 entitled the \"Rhode Island Economic Development Tax Incentives Evaluation Act of 2013\" was enacted into law. Rhode Island General Laws \u00a7 44- 48.2- 4(a) states that the Tax Expendit ure Report produced pursuant to Rhode Island General Laws \u00a7 44- 48.1- 1 \"shall include an additional analysis component,... produced in consultation with the director of the economic development corporation, the director of the office of management and budget, and the director of the department of labor and training.\" A total of 21 tax expenditure economic development incentives are to be analyzed \"at least once between July 1, 2014, and June 30, 2017, and no less than once every three (3) years thereafter\" while the analysis of any tax expenditure economic development incentives enacted into law after July 1, 2013 \"shall be completed within five (5) years of taking effect and no less than once every three (3) years thereafter\". The statutory references for th e 21 tax expenditure economic development incentives are listed in Rhode Island General Laws \u00a7 44-48.2- 3(a)(1). The additional analysis component that must be included in the tax expenditure report for these tax expenditure economic development incentives is detailed in Rhode Island General Laws \u00a7 44- 48.2- 5(a). The Office of Revenue Analysis produced reports containing the analysis required in Rhode Island General Laws \u00a7 44 -48.2- 5(a) for all 21 of the tax expenditure economic development incentives listed in Rhode Island General Laws \u00a7 44- 48.2- 3(a)(1) between March 2018 and July 2018. History of Rhode Island Law on Tax Expenditures Reporting Rhode Island's governing statute for tax expenditure reporting was passed into law without the Governor's signature on August 9, 1996 (see Rhode Island Public Laws 1996, Chapter 327, Section 1 and Chapter 394, Section 1). This initial statute required the state tax administrator to submit annually to the General Assembly beginning in 1998, on or be fore the second Tuesday in January, \"to the extent possible within the appropriations provided for the purpose,\" a tax expenditures report. The tax expenditures report for 1998 was to provide the \"minimum information\" for 25.0 percent of existing tax expe nditures. The report for 1999 would cover an 8 A full c opy of the statute governing tax incentive evaluation is contained in Appendix B. III. Introduction 2020 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 13 additional 25.0 percent of the tax expenditures, so that 50.0 percent of tax expenditures will have been reported. Similar 25.0 percent increments were required for 2000 and 2001, such that by January 2001, 100.0 percent of tax expenditures will have been reported. Beginning in January 2002, the cycle repeated itself so that no report on a tax expenditure item was more than four years old. The definition of tax expenditure was the same as it is in current law , as was the requirement for providing the legal reference of each tax expenditure, identifying the beneficiaries of each tax expenditure as well as similar taxpayers or industries that did not benefit from the tax expenditure, and comparing Rhode Island's tax expenditure items to those of other New England states , particularly Connecticut and Massachusetts. The original statute also required that the report include the legislative history of each tax expenditure, the \"determination of the beneficiary's st ate tax burden\" and a cost/benefit analysis of each tax expenditure item \"including the direct revenue loss from the tax expenditure as well as the economic and tax revenue gains occurring through the economic activity resulting from the tax expenditure.\" On June 25, 1997 (see Rhode Island Public Laws 1997, Chapter 30, Section 1), the original statute was amended to delete the requirement of the inclusion of a cost/benefit analysis for each tax expenditure item in the tax expenditure report. On July 10, 2003, the statute was amended again to change the periodicity of the report from annually to biannually beginning in 2004. In addition, the rolling renewal of 25.0 percent of existing tax expenditures was changed to require that \"the minimum information on 100.0 percent of tax expenditures in effect on January 1\" of the prior calendar year be reported. The requirement that the legislative history of a tax expenditure item be reported was eliminated leaving only the requirement that the legal reference for each tax expenditure item be reported. Further, the original statute was modified to require that an estimate of the revenue forgone that results from each tax expenditure item be reported if the actual amount cannot be determined and that such estimates be made for the calendar year preceding and following the year in which the report is published as well as the report's publication year. Additionally, the requirement that the beneficiary of tax expenditure item's state tax burden be determined was delet ed and replaced with the requirement that the data sources and analysis methodology underlying each estimate of revenue forgone be provided. Also, the amendment to the statute required each report to include \"a section containing recommendations for improving the effectiveness of the report as a tax policy tool\" including the resources required and an estimate of the costs associated with these recommendations. Finally, the revision to the statute required the state tax administrator to \"make available to the General Assembly a plan to improve Rhode Island's tax expenditure reporting effort\" by the second Tuesday in January 2004. On June 30, 2006, Rhode Island General Laws Chapter 44- 48.1 was amended to shift the responsibility for the delivery of the tax expenditure report from \"the state tax administrator, to the extent possible within the appropriations provided for the purpose\" to the Chief of the Office of Revenue Analysis without regard to appropriations provided for that purpose. In addition, this amendment required the Chief of the Office of Revenue Analysis to \"make available to the General Assembly a plan to improve Rhode Island's tax expenditure reporting effort\" by the second Tuesday in January 2004. This latter amendment could not be fulfille d given that the Office of Revenue Analysis was not created until June 2006. IV. Interpreting the Report 2020 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 14 Interpreting the Report The Index of Reliability Rhode Island General Laws \u00a7 44- 48.1-1 (c)(2)9 requires the tax administrator to \"develop an index of the reliability of each estimate\" of revenue forgone. By statute, the index of reliability is based on a scale of one to five, \"with level one being most reliable.\" The statute further specifies tha t estimates of revenue forgone that are derived from actual tax returns \"should be assigned reliability level one,\" while those estimates of revenue forgone for which no reliable data exists \"should be assigned reliability level five.\" T he 2010 Tax Expenditures Report was the first such report to provide such an index. The 2020 Tax Expenditures Report continues to use the reliability index that was developed in the 2010 Tax Expenditures Report . The Index of Reliability is shown below: Index of Reliability Interpretation Level One (1) Estimate is from actual Rhode Island tax return data Level Two (2) Estimate is extrapolated from Rhode Island source data Level Three (3) Estimate is from Rhode Island tax simulation model Level Four (4) Estimate is federal/national data scaled for Rhode Island Level Five (5) No reliable data exists from which to derive an estimate The end points of the Index of Reliability (i.e., Level One and Level Five) are consistent with their statutory mandates. An estimate of revenue forgone for a tax expenditure item that is assigned an Index of Reliability Level One will be based on actual Rhode Island tax return data. Given the fact that an Index of Reliability Level Five indicates that \"no reliabl e data exists from which to derive an estimate,\" tax expenditure items assigned this level will not have an estimate of revenue forgone presented. Rather, the phrase \"no estimate possible\" will be presented next to the tax expenditure item. The Index of Reliability Levels Two through Four requires some further explanation. An estimate of revenue forgone with an Index of Reliability Level Two is based on data that can be directly sourced to Rhode Island or an update of a previously derived estimate of the tax expenditure item. Some examples of data that can be directly sourced to Rhode Island include data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. In addition, state government agenci es, quasi -public agencies, and non- governmental organizations are able to provide reliable Rhode Island specific data from which to estimate the revenue forgone of a tax expenditure item. In the case of updating a previously derived estimate, the original estimate may be from a previously published tax expenditures report, a fiscal note that was completed for a particular piece of legislation during a session of the General Assembly, or an estimate that was derived by the Budget Office, the Division of Tax ation, the Office of Revenue Analysis or some other state agency for a purpose other than that of the tax expenditures report. 9 A full copy of the statute governing tax expenditure reporting is contained in Appendix A. IV. Interpreting the Report 2020 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 15 When an Index of Reliability Level Two is assigned to the revenue forgone estimate of a tax expenditure item, the source of the Rhode Island data will be specified. An estimate of revenue forgone for a tax expenditure item with an Index of Reliability Level Three is derived from a micro simulation model of a particular tax that has been developed and provided by a third -party vend or. In some cases , a micro simulation model will generate estimates based on underlying Rhode Island economic data rather than actual tax data. The most obvious example of this type of micro simulation model is the Rhode Island Micro Sales Tax Model that was purchased by the General Assembly in 2008 and made available to the Office of Revenue Analysis for the purpose of estimating the revenue impacts from changing sales tax rates, sales tax exemptions, and/or the sales tax base. This model is used extens ively to estimate the revenue forgone from the numerous transactions that are exempt from the State's sales and use tax. Finally, an estimate of revenue forgone for a tax expenditure item with an Index of Reliability Level Four is based on federal / natio nal data that is scaled to Rhode Island. Alternatively, the estimate may be based on federal data that is then adjusted by a factor that allows for the extrapolation of the federal data to Rhode Island. When an Index of Reliability Level Four is assigned to the revenue forgone estimate of a tax expenditure item, the date on which the original estimate was derived will be stated if it is known as will the method used to update the original estimate. In the case of an estimate that is based on federal data that is scaled to Rhode Island, the base federal data will be identified as will the scaling factor. Structure of the Report Previous tax expenditures reports presented tax expenditure items by tax type. In other words, the primary organizing key was t ax type with tax expenditure items appearing under each tax type. In the Tax Expenditures Report, January 2008, thirty -eight tax expenditure items are listed under the heading \"Personal Income\" and these tax expenditure items are comprised of modification s, credits, exclusions, adjustments, deductions and preferential tax rates. 10 In addition, when it comes to tax expenditure items, it is often the case that what is available for one tax type will also be made available for other tax types. For example, t he Motion Picture Production Tax Credit allows for a credit of 30.0 percent \"of the state certified production costs incurred directly attributable to activity within the state, provided that the primary locations are within the state of Rhode Island and t he total production budget as defined herein is a minimum of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000).\"11 This credit, which can be transferred or sold, can be used against the \"tax imposed\" under the state's business corporation tax, bank tax, insurance co mpan y gross premiums tax, and the personal income tax. As a result of this type of tax expenditure, tax expenditures report issued prior to the 2010 Tax Expenditures Report had to include a category labeled \"Tax Preference Items Applicable to More Than On e Tax\"12 in order to consistently categorize tax expenditure items. 10 State of Rhode Island, Department of Revenue, Division of Taxation, Tax Expendi tures Report, January 2008, p. 3. This report was prepared by Cecilia C. Vallee, Revenue Analyst, at the request of David M. Sullivan, Rhode Island Tax Administrator. 11 See Rhode Island General Laws \u00a7 44 -31.2- 5(a). 12 See Tax Expenditures Report, January 2008 , p. 144. IV. Interpreting the Report 2020 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 16 Beginning with the 2010 Tax Expenditures Report , the Office of Revenue Analysis adopted a different presentation format. Rather than list the tax expenditure items by the tax type to which they apply, the 2010 Tax Expenditures Report used the category of tax expenditure item as the organizing key. That is, each category of tax expenditure items listed each individual tax expenditure item and the tax types to which the individual tax expenditure item applies. For example, the Motion Picture Production Tax Credit would be categorized under \"Credits\" wi th the business corporation tax, bank tax, insurance compan y gross premiums tax, and the personal income tax as the relevant tax types. The 2020 Tax Expenditures Report follows the same approach as was adopted for the 2010 Tax Expenditures Report . To assist readers in the use of the 2020 Tax Expenditures Report , two sets of summary tables are included. The first set of summary tables lists the value of tax expenditur es by tax expenditure item. Thus, for example, under the category \"Credits\" the total value of each individual tax expenditure credit item, without regard to the tax type under which it was used, will be shown. The second set of summary tables lists the value of tax expenditures by tax type. Thus, for example, under the tax type \"Personal Income\" the total value of each individual tax expenditure item that is used under the personal income tax will be displayed. Definition of Terms The following defini tions will be used when referring to the different types of tax expenditure items included in this report. Credit : The direct dollar -for-dollar reduction of an individual's tax liability. The value of a tax credit is invariant to a taxpayer's tax bracke t. Deduction: An amount subtracted from adjusted gross income when calculating taxable income. The value of a tax deduction is proportional to a taxpayer's tax bracket. Exclusion: An amount or proportion that can be legally excluded from the taxable bas e prior to the assessment of tax. Exemption : A taxable expenditure, income, or investment on which no tax is levied. A tax exemption may be of limited or permanent duration. Modification : An amount added to or subtracted from gross income to arrive at a djusted gross income. Usually, adjusted gross income is the basis from which taxable income is derived. Preferential Tax Rate: A tax rate made available to certain taxpayers that is less than the statutory tax rate. Typically, the preferential tax rate is made available to taxpayers that meet specified criteria. Tax Abatement : Rebate given in levies or taxes under special circumstances or as an offset to the performance of particular actions. Tax Deferral : Paying taxes in the future for income earned i n the current year, such as through an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), 401(k), Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA or Keogh plan.

For CY 2019 ORA took estimated unused credit amounts as well as credit assigned for CY 2019 reported at the 2019 November Revenue Estimating Conference by the Rhode Island Film and Television Office. Credit usage per year was allocated in the same manner that was observed from previously assigned credit usage in CY 2012- CY 2018. ORA estimates that 26% of the credit issued is used in the year of issuance; 34% of the credit issued is used in the year immediately following issuance; 39% of the credit issued is used in the second year immediately following issuance; and 1% of the credit issued is used in the third year i mmediately following issuance. A similar method was used for CY 2020 and CY 2021 however, ORA estimated the amount of credit assigned by taking the average amount of credit assigned from CY 2013- CY 2018. Finally, the amount of projected credit was allocat ed to tax type by utilizing the average credit usage per tax type from TY 2015- TY 2018. VIII.

The value of the incentives is dependent upon the net fiscal benefit resulting from projected qualifying payroll and qualifying capital investment. An incentive ratio is applied to the net fiscal benefit generated by the cost -benefit model in order to determine the maximum award the VEPC may authorize for each application it approves. The VEPC shall calculate an incentive percentage for each approved application as follows: authorized award amount divided by the five -year sum of all payroll targets. An approval shall specify: the application base jobs at the time of the application; total jobs at time of application; the application base payroll; total payroll at time of application; the incentive percentage; the wage threshold; the payroll thresholds; a job target for each year of the award period; a payroll target for each year of the award period; a capital investment target for each year of the award period and a sufficient description of the nature of the qualifying capital investment over the award period.

Expensing of Assets in Lieu of Depreciation, Section 179 of Internal Revenue Code: Statutory Reference: Rhode Island General Law s Section 44- 61-1.1 Stated Purpose : No stated purpose given in law. Year Enacted / Last Year Amended : 2003 / 2013 Description : For purposes of the expensing of assets under Rhode Island General Laws Chapters 44-11, 44- 14 and 44- 30, the expense deduction for Rhode Island tax purposes shall be allowed in the same manner as is provided for under Section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). Any remaining tax basis of the asset purchased shall be depreciated as provided for under the IRC Sections 167 and 168, excluding \u00a7 168(k). Prior to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, Rhode Island's rule regarding Section 179 Expensing was a timing difference with Rhode Island disallowing section 179 expensing of more than $25,000 in a given tax year while the federal government allowed section 179 expensing of up to $500,000 in a given tax year . In this case, taxpayers had to add back to taxable income the amount of section 179 expensing in excess of $25,000 for Rhode Island tax purposes with this difference depreciated over the useful life of the asset. In tax years subsequent to the first year in which section 179 expensing in excess of $25,000 was used for federal income tax purposes, taxpayers subtracted the depreciation value of the asset from taxable income for Rhode Island tax purposes. Thus, over the useful life of the asset, the expense allowed for Rhode Island and Federal tax purposes will be equal . For tax years beginning after December 31, 2013, Rhode Island conformed to federal law with respect to section 179 expensing. Thus, whatever the deduction amount that was taken federally under section 179 expensing is also allowed for Rhode Island ta x purposes. As a result, for assets placed in service after December 31, 2013, there is no tax expenditure associated with section 179 expensing as the deduction allowed for Rhode Island tax purposes is the same as the deduction allowed for federal tax pu rposes. The Division of Taxation allows c orporate tax filers to report bonus depreciation , which is disallowed by Rhode Island law, and section 179 e xpensing on the same line as a total . As a result, depending on the tax year, the reported amounts on Rhode Island business corporation tax returns include both bonus depreciation and section 179 expensing . Generally, after tax year 2018, it is presumed that section 179 expensing deductions will no longer be reported as they will no longer exist due to confor mity with federal tax law with regard to section 179 expensing. Thus, this tax expenditure will, in general, terminate for tax years beginning after December 31, 2018.

The amount of revenue forgone is derived by multiplying the apportioned net decreasing deduction by the banking institutions excise tax rate of 9.0 percent.

Detail of Tax Expenditure Items - Deductions 2020 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 180 Federal AGI allows a deduction for tuition and fees. Tuition and fees are defined as qualified expenses for higher education. The maximum amount of tuition and fees that can be deducted is $4,000. The qualified higher education expenses can be for the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, or a dependent of the taxpayer. For tax years 201 6 and 2017, the tuition and fees deduction can only be taken by single filers with modified AGI of not more than $80,000 and married joint filers with modified AGI of not more than $160,000. Taxpayers who are married filing separately or who can be claimed as a dependent are ineligible for this deduction. The tuition and fees deduction expired on December 31, 2017 and may not be taken for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. It should be noted that the tuition and fees deduction expired on December 31, 2016 but was retroactively extended for TY 2017 by Congress on February 9, 2018, which was after the TY 2017 filing season began.

For TY 2016 , these Rhode Island resident effective tax rates range from - 0.5384% for the federal AGI category of under $25,000 to 2.9163% for the federal AGI category of $100,000 to $200,000.

Tax Expenditure Items - Exemptions 2020 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 284 56. Personal and Dependent : Statutory Reference: Rhode Island General Laws Section 44- 30-2.6(c)(3)(C) / Rhode Island Public Laws 2018, Chapter 47, Article 4, Section 13 Stated Purpose : No stated purpose given in law. Year Enacted / Last Year Amended : 2001 / 2018 Description : Resident and non- resident taxpayers are allowed a personal and/or dependent exemption against the tax imposed by Rhode Island General Laws Chapter 44- 30. The exemption amount is adjusted for inflation as determined by Rhode Island General Laws Section 44- 30- 2.6(c)(3)(E) using tax year 2000 as the base year. A personal exemption is granted to the taxpayer and spouse, if jointly filing a tax return, and the dependent exemption is granted to the dependents that are claime d by the taxpayer on their federal income tax return. The Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) eliminated federal personal and dependent exemptions. The 2018 General Assembly enacted several changes to allow Rhode Island personal and dependent exemptions to continue. For tax years beginning on or after 2018, the term exemption amount means the same as it did in the Internal Revenue Code Section 151 and 152 as of December 22, 2017. The exemption amount will be adjusted for inflation . If the taxpayer iden tification number (TIN) is not listed on the federal income tax form for any individual, the TIN must be listed on the Rhode Island personal income tax form for the exemption to be claimed. Tax Year Personal and Dependent Exemption Amount Phase -Out Range 2016 $3,900 $193,600 - $227,050 Data Source: Division of Taxation, Office of Revenue Analysis (ORA) Personal Income Tax Simulation Model. ORA calculated the Rhode Island tax liability for each taxpayer under TY 2016 and 2017 Rhode Island personal income tax laws and the Rhode Island tax liability for each taxpayer without the personal and dependent exem ptions for the same tax years, then summed the results for both calculations across all taxpayers. Revenue forgone is determined by taking the difference between the two tax liability calculations. Number of taxpayers includes all taxpayers that claimed an exemption to reduce their personal tax liability.

Tax Expenditure Items - Exemptions 2020 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 285 Projection Methodology : For TY 2018, revenue forgone is projected using the TY 2017 ORA Personal Income Tax Model rebased to TY 20 18 Rhode Island personal income tax laws. Similarly, for TY 2019 the model is rebased to TY 2019 Rhode Island personal income tax laws. For TY 2020, the a mount of exemption is grown by the growth rate in the exemption amount of 2.500 percent (i.e., $4,100 / $4,000). For TY 20 21, TY 2020 revenue forgone was grown by the rate of inflation from the Consensus Economic Forecast adopted at the November 2019 Revenue Estimating Conference . The number of taxpayers for TY 2018 and TY 2019 is projected using the ORA Personal Income Tax Model. For TY 2020 and 2021 the number of taxpayers is held constant with TY 2019.

(3) Since the establishment of arts districts, many communities have s ought legislation to expand the program to their city or town. (4) There is value in expanding the arts district program statewide, providing incentives for the sale and purchase of art.

Sales in Municipal Economic Development Zones : Statutory Reference: Rhode Island General Laws Section 44- 18-30.C Stated Purpose : The General Assembly makes the following findings of fact: (1) Various sections of several towns in the state, including, but not limited to, the town of West Warwick, are deteriorated, blighted areas which have created very difficult challenges to econ omic development; (2) Several areas of the state are in a distressed financial condition as defined by Rhode Island General Laws Section 45 -13-12(b) and cannot finance economic development projects on its own without the participation of private enterprise ; (3) The General Assembly has found that it is nearly impossible for private enterprise alone to meet these challenges; (4) In certain sections of financially distressed communities, the serious challenges of economic development and/or redevelopment have not been met by private enterprise alone and the impact is being felt throughout the community; (5) Legislation enacted to encourage redevelopment of the deteriorated, blighted areas through the formation of local redevelopment agencies has had very limited success; (6) Various states, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Michigan, have had a great deal of success in generating economic development by exercising the authority to exempt and/or stabilize taxes; (7) The State of Rhode Island has generated eco nomic growth by redirecting and/or exempting certain commercial and retail activity from the imposition of sales, use and income taxes with recent examples being the Providence Place Mall, the Arts Districts in the cities of Providence, Pawtucket and Weste rly, and financial services and aquaculture industries; (8) Most recently, municipalities in our state have had great success in attracting large commercial development, including financial services, manufacturing, and major energy facilities, due in large part to the authority to exempt and/or stabilize property, tangible and/or inventory taxes; (9) Attracting large non -residential developments or encouraging expansion of existing commercial entities can be extremely important to municipalities, where the quality of public education is largely dependent on the local tax base, thereby expanding the commercial tax base and reducing reliance upon the residential tax base; (10) The ability to attract this development and increase the non-residential tax base, i n turn, improves municipalities' ability to finance school systems, municipal services and infrastructure, thereby improving the quality of life; (11) In addition to increasing the local non -residential tax base, this development creates construction jobs, permanent jobs, and spurs additional investment by private enterprises; and (12) Providing authority to offer tax exemptions from, or to stabilize, the imposition of sales and use taxes will attract and assist in expanding, revitalizing and redeveloping t he tax base in our municipalities, thereby providing long -term economic benefits and development.

Bonus Depreciation Provided by JCWAA of 2002 and JGTRRA of 2003: Statutory Reference: Rhode Island General Laws Section 44- 61-1 Stated Purpose : No stated purpose given in law. Year Enacted / Last Year Amended : 2002 / 2008 Description : For purposes of depreciating assets under Rhode Island General Laws Chapters 44- 11, 44- 14 and 44- 30, the bonus depreciation provided by the federal Job Creation and Worke rs Assistance Act (JCWAA) of 2002 and the federal Jobs Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (JGTRRA) of 2003, or any subsequent enactment for federal tax purposes, is not allowed for Rhode Island tax purposes. In the year those assets are placed in servic e and in all subsequent years, depreciation for Rhode Island tax purposes is allowed as it would have been computed prior to the enactment of the JCWAA of 2002. The JCWAA of 2002 allowed a special 30.0 percent bonus depreciation deduction in the first year for qualifying property purchased after September 10, 2001, and before September 11, 2004, for purposes of computing federal net income. In addition, the JCWAA of 2002 modified Internal Revenue Code Section 168(k) to allow taxpayers to claim an additional first -year bonus depreciation allowance on any new Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) property when the recovery period is 20 years or less. The additional depreciation allowance is equal to 30.0 percent of the adjusted cost basis of the property after any Internal Revenue Code Section 179 expense deductions are taken. The JGTRRA of 2003 increased the bonus depreciation deduction from 30.0 perce nt to 50.0 percent for assets purchased after May 5, 2003, but before January 1, 2005. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 extended some bonus depreciation rules for certain aircraft as well as other items. The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 reintroduc ed bonus depreciation of 50.0 percent for qualifying property placed in service in TY 2008. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended the 50.0 percent bonus depreciation for qualifying property placed in service in TY 2009. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 increased the bonus depreciation from 50.0 percent to 100.0 percent for qualifying property acquired and placed in service after September 8, 2010, but before January 1, 2012. Qualifying property acquired on or before September 8, 2010 was eligible for the 50.0 percent bonus depreciation, provided that it was placed in service prior to January 1, 2013. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 extends the 50.0 percent bonus depreciation for qualifying property placed in service in TY 2013. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act of 2015 extended bonus depreciation to property acquired and placed in service before 2020 while retaining the 50 percent bonus depreciation in 2017 and providing for lesser bonus depreciation per centages of 40 percent for TY 2018 and 30 percent for TY 2019. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 retained the 50 percent bonus depreciation for property placed in service on or before September 27, 2017 and increased the bonus depreciation to 100 percent for property placed in service after September 27, 2017 but before January 1, 2023. Beginning on January 1, 2023, the allowable bonus depreciation decreases by 20 percentage points in each subsequent year until it reaches zero percent on January 1, 2027. VIII. Tax Expenditure Items - Modifications 2020 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 351 Rhode Island's disallowance of bonus depreciation is a timing issue. In the year that an asset is put in service and is eligible for the federal bonus depreciation, a Rhode Island taxpayer must take as a modification increasing federal adjusted gr oss income (AGI) the difference in the bonus depreciation amount allowed on the federal tax return and the depreciation amount allowed for Rhode Island tax purposes. In subsequent years, a Rhode Island taxpayer may take as a modification decreasing federal AGI the difference in the depreciation amount allowed for Rhode Island tax purposes and the depreciation amount allowed on the federal tax return. At the end of the asset's \"useful\" life, the same amount of depreciation will be realized by the taxpayer on both the federal and the Rhode Island tax returns. Thus, over the life of the asset, there is no net impact on Rhode Island tax collections. Data Source: Personal Income Tax : Office of Revenue Analysis (ORA) calculations. Modifications include adjustments that either increase or decrease federal AGI. For TY 2016 and TY 2017, the total net modification by resident and non- resident taxpayers increased federal AGI; therefore, there is no revenue forgone from this modification in TY 2016 or TY 2017. T he number of taxpayers includes those resident and non- resident taxpayers with a modification that either increased or decreased federal AGI.

Connecticut : Connecticut personal income tax law requires that for property placed in service after September 10, 2001 but prior to September 11, 2004, in taxable years ending after September 10, 2001, any additional allow ance for depreciation under Section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), as provided by the JCWAA of 2002, to the extent deductible in determining federal AGI be recorded as a modification increasing federal AGI for Connecticut income tax purposes. In addition, to the extent any additional allowance for depreciation under Section 168(k) of the IRC, as provided by the JCWAA of 2002, for property placed in service after December 31, 2001, but prior to September 10, 2004, was added to federal AGI in com puting Connecticut AGI for a taxable year ending after December 31, 2001, Connecticut personal income tax law allows for a modification decreasing federal AGI for Connecticut income tax purposes of 25.0 percent of such additional allowance for depreciation in each of the four succeeding taxable years. Effective for tax year 2017 and going forward, Connecticut decoupled from the federal bonus depreciation deduction, taxpayers who report a subtraction modification on their federal return must report a bonus depreciation addition modification on the Connecticut return. The taxpayer may then report 25.0 percent of such additional allowance for depreciation in each of the four succeeding taxable years. VIII. Tax Expenditure Items - Modifications 2020 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 353 Connecticut corporation tax law states that for purposes of determining net income subject to tax, the deduction allowed for depreciation shall be determined as provided under the IRC, provided that in making such determination the provisions of Section 168(k) of the IRC do not apply. Connecticut Statute: Co nn. Gen.

The addition modifications are recaptured in future years through a series of subtraction modifications. Federal AGI or federal net income is reduced by a fraction of any amount previously added back by the taxpayer. For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, an amount equal to the net increase in the depreciation deduction allowable under Sections 167 and 168 of the IR C that would have been applicable to that property had the depreciation deduction under Section 168(k) of the IRC not been claimed with respect to such property placed in service during the taxable year for which an addition was required under subsection 1, paragraph KK, subparagraph (2) for the taxable year . Maine Statute: Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. Massachusetts personal income tax law excludes from \"Part B adjusted gross income\" the deduction allowed by Section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), as amended and in effect for the current tax year .

The adjustment requires: (1) the removal of the federal bonus depreciation in effect for the taxable year; and (2) the inclusion of only the depreciation allowed under the IRC in effect on December 31, 2000.

Recognition of Income from Discharge of Business Indebtedness : Statutory Reference: Rhode Island General Laws Section 44- 66-1 Stated Purpose : No stated purpose given in law. Year Enacted / Last Year Amended : 2009 / N/A Description : For purposes of computing Rhode Island taxable income under Rhode Island General Laws Chapters 44- 11, 44 -14 and 44- 30, the recognition of income from the discharge of business indebtedness deferred under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 for federal tax purposes, must be reported as a modification increasing federal income for Rhode Island tax purposes in the year the discharge of indebtedness occurred. When claimed as income on a future federal tax return the deferred amount of the discharge of indebtedness may be reported as a modification decreasing federal income for Rhode Island tax purposes. The ARRA of 2009 allowed certain businesses that had debts discharged in 2009 and 2010 to defer the recognition of income from the cancellation of such debts until 2014 and then spread that recognition of income over a five -year period. Rhode Island's disallowance of the recognition of income from the discharge of business indebtedness is a timing issue.

Any mutual fund service corporat ion whose employment level in the current taxable year is equal to or greater than its jobs commitment level for such taxable year or any such mutual fund service corporation for which the jobs commitment level requirement no longer applies shall apportion such income by multiplying it by 100 percent of the sales factor. A mutual fund service corporation that fails to achieve its jobs commitment level may still use 100 percent of the sales factor in apportioning net income if the failure to achieve the job s commitment level for any taxable year is demonstrated by the mutual fund service corporation to be a direct result of adverse economic conditions in that taxable year. Any taxable net income received by mutual fund sales that is not derived from mutual fund sales must be apportioned using the standard Massachusetts three factor apportionment. A mutual fund service corporation that has taxable net income from mutual fund sales as well as taxable net income from non -mutual fund sales in the same tax year will have two income apportionment percentages for that year.

IX. Recommendations for Improving the Report 2020 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 423 Recommendations for Improving the Report The Tax Expenditures Report's effectiveness as a tax policy tool is dependent on the report's users' background, knowledge of state tax law , and ability to understand the process by which estimates have been derived by the Office of Revenue Analysis. Although 55.1 percent of the tax expenditure items for which reliable data existed in TY 201 7 were assigned a reliability level index of \"1,\" meaning the source of the derived estimate was actual tax returns, ideally 100.0 percent of the derived estimates for tax expenditure items for which reliable data exists should have as a source the actual tax return from which the estimate is derived . The primary tax type for which actual tax return data does not exist and thus estimates of forgone revenue must be derived via l ess reliable methods is the sales and use tax. Given that the sales and use tax is the second largest source of state general revenue and that it also is the tax type for which the greatest amount of forgone revenue was estimated at $1,432,207,659 in TY 2 017, the Office of Revenue Analysis finds that the quality and quantity of data collected for the sales and use tax needs to be improved for there to be an increase in the reliability of the forgone revenue estimates for the sales and use tax. In additi on, the quantity and quality of data for the business corporation tax is lacking. The business corporation tax, commonly referred to as the corporate income tax, is the tax type with the fourth largest amount of estimated forgone revenue due to tax expenditure items at $56,412,732 in TY 2017, but has one of the largest percentage of tax expenditures items at 40.4 percent for which no reliable data exists from which to derive estimates of forgone revenue. This compares to 6.6 percent of tax expenditure items for which no reliable data exists for the personal income tax and 33.3 percent of tax expenditure items for which no reliable data exists for the sales and use tax. The Office of Revenue Analysis finds that the quality and quantity of data collected for the business corporation tax needs to be improved for there to be an increase in the reliability of the forgone revenue estimates for the business corporation tax. Unf ortunately, most of the data that would improve the reporting of business corporation tax expenditure items is not reported on the taxpayers' tax returns and the crux of the issue in this regard i s that these are calculations that are done at the firm level before arriving at taxable income, which is where the Rhode Island return begins. To this end, the Office of Revenue Analysis is recommending updating the report's interpretation of tax expendi ture. Under current law, a tax expenditure is defined as any tax credit, deduction, exemption, exclusion, credit preferential tax rate, tax abatement, and tax deferral that provides preferential treatment to selected taxpayers, whether directly through Rh ode Island general laws or constitutional provisions or indirectly through adoption of other tax codes. Other states' tax expenditures reports, such as Connecticut and Minnesota, include criteria that a tax expenditure provision must meet before a tax expenditure item is included in the tax expenditures report. In preparing their respective tax expenditure reports, these states do not include every exemption, deduction, credit, or lower tax rate. A provision must meet all the criteria in order to be a ta x expenditure. Such criteria include, if a provision has an impact on a tax that is applied statewide; confers preferential treatment; results in reduced tax revenue in the applicable fiscal years; is not included as an expenditure item in the state budge t; is included in the defined tax base for that tax; is not subject to an alternative tax; and can be amended or repealed by a change in state law. IX. Recommendations for Improving the Report 2020 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 424 Of interest to the Office of Revenue Analysis in this recommendation is the criteria of whether the provis ion is an exception to the tax base. The exclusion of certain income is currently reported in the 2020 Tax Expenditures Report however, ORA is recommending removing such items from the report. For example, currently included in the report, is an exclusion set forth in Rhode Island General Laws Section 44 -43-5 which excludes any long- term gains from capital investments in small businesses from the determination of income that is subject to the tax imposed by R.I.G.L. Chapters 44- 11, 44- 13, 44- 14 or 44- 30. This type of income is excluded from taxable income and not reported on taxpayers' returns but instead calculated at the firm level before arriving at taxable income. Finally, the criteria regarding provisions subject to more than one tax would be useful in eliminating some expenditure items where no estimate can be derived nor expected to be calculated. In some instances, one tax may be imposed in place of another tax, and it would not be reasonable for a taxpayer or activity to be subject to both taxes. The exemption from one tax type when another is imposed is currently reported in the 2020 Tax Expenditures Report , however ORA is recommending removing these items from the report. For example, currently included in the report, is an exclusion set forth in Rhode Island General Laws Section 44- 11-1(4)(ii) for public service corporations from the tax imposed by R.I.G.L. 44 -11. These taxpayers are excluded from paying under the business corporation tax and required to pay under another tax type, public service corporation tax. It is not clear if this exclusion is a tax expenditure if the inclusion generates more revenue than the exclusion precludes. ORA believes these two updates are a logical application of the tax expenditure concept, while making the re port more accessible to readers. ORA lacks the authority to implement these two updates without a change to Rhode Island General Laws \u00a7 44 -48.1- 1(b). In this regard, ORA would recommend that this section be amended as follows: \u00a7 44- 48.1- 1. Tax expenditur e reporting. (a) On or before the second Tuesday in January of each even numbered year beginning in 2004, the chief of the office of revenue analysis, shall deliver a tax expenditure report to the general assembly. Each report will provide the minimum information for one hundred percent (100%) of tax expenditures in effect on January 1 of the calendar year preceding the report's publication. (b) For the purposes of this section, a \"tax expenditure\" is a ny tax credit, deduction, exemption, exclusion, cred it preferential tax rate, tax abatement, and tax deferral that provides preferential treatment to selected taxpayers, whether directly through Rhode Island general laws or constitutional provisions or indirectly through adoption of other tax codes . provide d, however, that such a tax expenditure does not subject the selected taxpayers to tax elsewhere in Title 44 or the Rhode Island General Laws. (c) The information included for each tax expenditure shall include, but shall not be limited to: (1) The legal reference of the expenditures, including information whether the expenditure is required as a result of federal or state constitutional, judicial, or statutory mandate. (2) Amount of revenues forgone or an estimate, if the actual amount cannot be determined, for the calendar year immediately preceding the publication of the report. The report shall also IX. Recommendations for Improving the Report 2020 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 425 include an estimate of revenue forgone for the calendar year in which the report is published and the year following the report's publication. The tax admi nistrator shall develop an index of the reliability of each estimate using five (5) levels with level one being most reliable. Where actual tax returns are the source of the estimate, the estimate should be assigned reliability level one. Where no reliable data exists for the estimate, the estimate should be assigned reliability level five (5). The reliability level shall be reported for the estimate of the revenues forgone. (3) To the extent allowable by law, identification of the beneficiaries of the exe mption by number, income, class and industry. (4) A comparison of the tax expenditure to the tax systems of the other New England states, with emphasis on Massachusetts and Connecticut. (5) The data source(s) and analysis methodology. (6) To the extent allowable by law, identification of similar taxpayers or industries that do not enjoy the exemption. (d) Each report shall include a section containing recommendations for improving the effectiveness of the report as a tax policy tool. This section shall identify the resources required to implement these recommendations and shall also contain an estimate of the costs associated with such recommendations. (e) On or before the second Tuesday in January 2004, the chief of the office of revenue analysis shall make available to the general assembly a plan to improve Rhode Island's tax expenditure reporting effort. The plan shall include measurable criteria to evaluate improvements in the reliability of tax expenditure item estimates and the identification of be neficiaries of each tax expenditure by number, income, class and industry. The plan shall also include cost estimates of additional resources necessary to implement the plan and may include any other information that the tax administrator deems appropriate for inclusion in said plan.

(P.L. 2013, ch. B: Current Statute of Tax Incentives Evaluation 2020 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 432 Appendix C : Defunct Tax Expenditure Items Found in Rhode Island Law Due to various law changes, there are tax expenditure items found listed in the Rhode Island General Laws that are unable to be taken against one or more tax types. In the 2010 Session, the Rhode Island Legislature enacted a personal income tax reform that explicitly stated which credits may be used against the personal income tax. Credits not listed in Rhode Island General Laws Section 44- 30-2.6(c)(2)(F) are not able to be taken. Credits that are no longer able to be taken against the personal income tax may still be able to be taken against another tax type. Additionally, in the 2014 Session, the legislature enacted a change to the business corporation tax requiring the use of combined reporting, single sales factor apportionment of net income, and market -based sourcing of sales for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015, which rendered several tax expenditure items associated with the business corporation tax moot. Also, in the 2014 Session, the legislature rep ealed the franchise tax (Rhode Island General Laws Chapter 44- 12) for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015, which eliminated any tax expenditure item established against taxes imposed by the franchise tax . Finally, there are tax expenditure items that have been allowed to expire through a sunse t provision or other enacted legislation. ORA has included a list of these items that were eliminated due to legislation enacted in or after the 2008 Session.
