Western medicine and science seeks to find and explain a mechanism through which any healing works, and struggles to acknowledge any modality that does not fit neatly into a scientific explanation. In recent years, however, Western medicine has begun to be more accepting to complementary and alternative treatments. We in the West are learning that complementary treatments, such as Reiki, can support and supplement conventional Western medical treatments. More and more hospitals and clinics are offering Reiki or encouraging their clients to seek Reiki. The National Health Service in Great Britain covers Reiki along with other complementary and alternative treatments. The world-renowned Mayo Clinic offers Reiki. The Mayo Clinic [explains](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fmayoclinichealthsystem.org%2Flocations%2Fonalaska%2Fmedical-services%2Fcomplementary-medicine%2Fcenter-for-health-and-healing%2Freiki&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0kgNg7YgERZ0H9NIiuG02n) Reiki: Reiki (ray key) is a non-invasive healing method that promotes relaxation, enhances the body's natural healing abilities, and fosters mental, emotional and spiritual well-being. Like Healing Touch, Reiki is based on the idea of an energy field that permeates the human body. ... Reiki seeks to restore order to the body whose energy has become unbalanced. The healing energy of Reiki can be used to provide relief from conditions such as fatigue, pain, anxiety, negative side effects of treatments and medications, joint problems, and other ailments. Reiki does not replace, but rather is easily integrated with any medical treatment and other therapies to assist in activating a person's inner healing potential. Reiki is now being used in a growing number of hospitals and clinics throughout the United States and throughout the world. The Cleveland Clinic is a nearly century-old academic and clinical medical center that has long ranked among the top hospitals in the country. The Cleveland Clinic offers Reiki to its patients, and has [this](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fmy.clevelandclinic.org%2Fservices%2Fwellness%2Fintegrative-medicine%2Ftreatments-services%2Freiki&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1nWNInQV-JyLtDpxGxgyvi) to say about Reiki: Reiki is a form of hands-on, natural healing that uses universal life force energy. ... This gentle energy is limitless in abundance and is believed to be a spiritual form of energy. ... The Reiki practitioner is the conduit between you and the source of the universal life force energy. The energy flows through the practitioner's energy field and through his or her hands to you. ... Reiki is a complement to traditional medical or therapeutic treatments. Reiki complements all other types of medical and therapeutic treatments. ... Reiki is not specific to any particular types of diseases or conditions. Because it works on the entire self - mind, body and emotions - and because it is universal life force energy, it may be successful in all types of physical, emotional, mental and spiritual healing, depending on your needs. . . . Meanwhile, Western doctors and medical researchers are applying their scientific tools to study the efficacy of Reiki. This work is continuing, and much further study is needed. However, the results so far are confirming what has been known by hands-on healers all over our world for thousands of years: Reiki and other energy healing works. "}
