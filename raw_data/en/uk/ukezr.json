She states that she has been smoking since was seventeen years old and smokes a pack a day. She states that she would like to stop smoking because she would like to have a 'healthier lifestyle'. She works full-time in an administrative position in a nursing facility. She does not have a support system in the home but does have support from friends in community and fellow workers at her place of employment. Throughout the years there have been two traditions within the practice of medicine. One is the 'art of healing ' which involves its own specialised brand of training. The art of healing is dependent on the prescriber 's foreknowledge and the clients' viewpoint of the prosperous results. The 'Science of healing ' is based on scientific and technological ideas. This tradition results in a lower liability for practitioners regarding the showing of an original approach to medicine, however the results of this method are more calculable (Kayne 2002). It is believed that the tradition of the 'art of healing' is increasing in popularity. The World Health Organisation states ' 'that the terms ' 'complementary medicine ' ' or ' 'alternative medicine' ' are used interchangeably with traditional medicine in some countries. They refer to a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country 's own tradition and are not integrated into the dominant health care system\" (World Health Organization 2000). This type of treatment, is commonly known as 'Complementary and alternative medicine' (CAM). The word complementary derives from the meaning 'together with' established practices and the word alternative refers to 'in place' of established practices. Some patients choose to participate in complementary therapies along with the medication prescribed by their general practitioner whilst others prefer complementary therapies as opposed to the medications Moreover, the holistic evaluation incorporates the body's integrity and its relationship with the environment since the body should be in sync with the external environment in a mutually-interactive manner. This paper seeks to discuss the personal health concern using personal vitality through holistic evaluation and thus apply concepts of holism to the understanding of the interdependence between an individual and their environment. Healthcare is a collaborative approach and Holistic is becoming the new age medicine. Patients looking for home remedies to treat symptoms and diseases rather than go to a physician and get placed on life-long medication. Mind, body, and spirituality is my way of practice. I will pray for the veterans even without them knowing it. Task 3 In contemporary society modern medicine usually takes on a curative role, it attempts to cure. Complementary therapy however takes on a very different role; it is used to maintain wellbeing and health as well as a helping to restore wellbeing to before illness or poor health. These therapies are usually used in conjunction with modern medicine. This is usually to relieve symptoms that traditional medicine fails to help with or to boost a person's emotional or physical health. Order the following from most significant to least significant in the history of medicine: 1-Holistic assessment and care: - With the holistic approach all patients suffering from the same disease are not viewed and treated as same anymore. Calder argues '...the importance of providing such services for a family who may conceal or minimise their difficulties' (2008) implies that an holistic way of working with families who are experiencing significant and complex difficulties is the most effective approach for social workers. This holistic approach would consist of assessing Nursing is about providing the best possible holistic care for the patient and family. At the same time there's an imbalance of patient care regarding education and knowledge being provided by nurses. As a nurse I believe we all owe it to ourselves, the profession, and the patient to provide the best possible care. According to American Nurses Association (ANA) online article \"Nursing is the protection, promotion, and optimization of health and abilities, prevention of illness and injury, alleviation of suffering through the diagnosis and treatment of human response, and advocacy in the care of individuals, families, communities, and populations.\" In order to better achieve the nursing ideals of the American Nurses Association we must improve patient care by requiring hospital nurses to become BSN nurses. An Art of Balance: The Role of Holistic Medicine in Modern Healthcare By: Alex C. Thau Bioethics 4242 12/3/16 Over the last 10,000 years, humans have evolved more than any other species that has ever set foot on planet Earth. As a population we have grown exponentially and made changes to our society that allow us to do things that have not been done before. In 1878, Thomas Edison recognized the ability of a bamboo filament that was connected to platina wires, to burn for significant periods of time: resulting in the first formation of the light bulb. Suddenly, the human race no longer had to endure the darkness that each night brought at the end of a 12-hour light period. Today we have alternative medicine which was developed thousands of years ago and have a long-standing historical value of effectiveness, advantages, and some drawbacks. Diagnosis was the first approach to any illness. Alternative medicine looks at the factors of equilibrium and the environment in which one lives and the disease is considered an imbalance between the two; cleansing the whole body than on a particular problem to get the balance back in sync. Very much the description of the Buddhist and the Greek cultures of medicine and healing the Complementary and alternative medicine, or CAM, can be characterized as a gathering of restorative, human services, and healing systems other than those incorporated into health care in the United States. CAM incorporates the perspectives, speculations, modalities, items, and practices connected with these systems and their utilization to treat disease and advance health and prosperity (McKenzie, 2012). Even though heterogeneous, the significant CAM frameworks have numerous normal attributes, including an attention on individualizing medications, treating the entire individual, advancing self-consideration and self-recuperating, and perceiving the otherworldly way of every person. What's more, numerous CAM frameworks have attributes generally found in standard human services, for example, an emphasis on great sustenance and preventive practices. Dissimilar to standard medication, CAM frequently needs or has just restricted trial and clinical concentrate; then again, experimental examination of CAM is starting to address this learning crevice. In this manner, limits in the Client's behaviors limiting holistic health (3 or more): 1. Client does not like western medicine; she prefers homeopathic remedies to medications and exhibits distrust of some medications. She takes her insulin daily because she thinks it does not harm her body because her body makes it. However she believes that even with the severity of her pain the holistic needs the individual person, family and community. Jacksonville School of Nursing Handbook (2014). School of Nursing Philosophy pp. 2-3. I feel that the components: diversity, educational background, engaged learning, scholarly Inquiry, clinical experience and socialization are much needed for practicing nursing. It can Guide you to the holistic module; along with the generation of caring. A caring approach A wide range of treatments exists under the umbrella term of 'complementary therapy'. Each treatment has its own unique theory and practice, which makes it difficult to offer a These therapies have proved to be of much benefit in supporting the normal healing course of the body. Even though there are many modern alternative remedies, with different beliefs, all of them operate under some common principles. One of these principles is that the body has the capacity to heal naturally and maintain stability (Paquette, 2000). The other one is that adverse health conditions can occur as a result of factors emanating from mind, emotions and the body. Alternative medicine, according to Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, (2002), focuses on determining the chief cause of a particular condition, and dealing with the whole person rather that concentrating on symptoms. If a person pays close attention to his/her health he/she can contribute to his/her wellbeing. Alternative medicine holds firmly to the principle that one treatment cannot be used for all people even though they may be suffering from the same condition. Each and every person as per alternative medicine has distinct bodily, mind and spiritual make up (Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, 2002). "}
