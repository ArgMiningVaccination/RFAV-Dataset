Frequently Asked Questions [What vaccine is Memorial Healthcare System administering?](#) Memorial Healthcare System is currently providing the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. A two dose series separated by 21 days. If you meet the criteria for a third dose it is recommended you receive the same mRNA vaccine vaccine. If the mRNA vaccine product given for the first two doses is not available or is unknown, either mRNA COVID-19 vaccine product can be administered. The vaccine is given in the deltoid arm muscle, similar to where a flu shot is given. [Is there a cost for the vaccines?](#) Vaccines are provided at no cost to recipients and insurance is not required. However we will request consent to verify insurance coverage; no fees will be billed to the patient. Memorial is committed to administering the COVID-19 vaccine to individuals regardless of the vaccine recipient's ability to pay COVID-19 vaccine administration fees. If you receive a bill for the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, or have any questions regarding billing, please contact 954-276-5501 or email us at [mybill@mhs.net](mailto:mybill@mhs.net?subject=COVID-19%20Vaccine%20Billing%20Inquiry). [What are the most commonly reported side effects?](#) [If we need a booster, are the vaccines working?](#) Yes. COVID-19 vaccines are working well to prevent severe illness, hospitalization, and death. However, public health experts are starting to see reduced protection over time against mild and moderate disease, especially among certain populations. [What are the risks to getting a booster?](#) Adults and children may have some side effects from a COVID-19 vaccine, including pain, redness or swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, and nausea. Serious side effects are rare, but may occur. [Am I still considered \"fully vaccinated\" if I don't get a booster?](#) Yes, the definition of fully vaccinated has not changed and does not include a booster. Everyone is still considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their second dose in a two-dose series, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, or two weeks after the single-dose J&J/Janssen vaccine. Fully vaccinated, however, is not the same as having the best protection. People are best protected when they stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations, which includes getting one booster when eligible. "}
