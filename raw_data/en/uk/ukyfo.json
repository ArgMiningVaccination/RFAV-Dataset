The Bay Area health officers said they are proactively imposing the stay-at-home order to close all sectors other than retail and essential operations beginning this weekend rather than waiting until the region's Intensive Care Unit (ICU) bed capacity drops below 15 percent [, the trigger Gov. Gavin Newsom announced on Dec. 3.](http://s.bl-1.com/h/dbr83stG?url=https://pikasso.bananatag.com/?v=1607198289947) This new stay-at-home order will take effect in Contra Costa, Santa Clara, and San Francisco counties and the city of Berkeley on Sunday, Dec. 6.

Campus Life Services: SF Kebab, the eatery at the Mission Bay campus, will discontinue outdoor dining and will be open for take-out orders only. Both Bakar and Millberry Fitness Centers and the UCSF Library have already closed until further notice. Shuttle service will continue to operate at 25 percent capacity. Health Care: Scheduled elective procedures will continue as planned and appointments have not been cancelled at this time. Hospital capacity will be closely monitored and any changes to health care operations will be based on the UCSF Health surge plan. Education: All didactic and discussion-based courses for all programs will continue to run remotely. Health professions students will continue to participate in clinical placements and rotations and in essential on-campus activities as directed by their programs; they will be notified by their programs if there are any changes to those schedules. Graduate students who need to be physically present in their labs will continue to be included in the 50 percent maximum capacity; those who can do their research from home should continue to do so. As the pandemic continues to surge in California, teams across UCSF will monitor the situation daily and make adjustments as needed, so please stay tuned to all COVID-19 announcements and updates posted on the [UCSF coronavirus website](http://s.bl-1.com/h/dbr8364N?url=https://coronavirus.ucsf.edu/).

[Watch the event recording.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-i7zSKqcbmE) April 15, 2020 [The following message was sent by the Office of Communications:] There have been several recent developments around UCSF's COVID-19 response, and we want to make you aware of the following updates: 1. Policy Update: Self-Reporting COVID-19 Test Results In order to safeguard the health of the UCSF community and those we serve, UCSF is enacting a new policy aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19. Starting Wednesday, April 15, 2020, all UCSF affiliates who test positive or have previously tested positive for COVID-19 at an outside facility (e.g., Kaiser, Sutter) must self-report these results to the appropriate UCSF department, as outlined below. - Students must self-report positive test result to UCSF Student Health and Counseling Services by calling (415) 476-8736 or [sending a secure message](https://myhealthrecord.ucsf.edu/home.aspx)to the student health nurse. - Faculty, staff, trainees, and volunteers must self-report positive test result to UCSF Occupational Health Services (OHS) by calling the COVID-19 hotline at (415) 514-7328 or emailing [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#26494e55665345554008434253). - Anyone who provides services for UCSF on a contract basis (e.g., on-site vendors) are strongly encouraged, though not required, to disclose positive test results to OHS. - Occupants of UCSF housing with no official UCSF affiliation are strongly encouraged, though not required, to disclose positive test results to OHS. - Self-reporting positive test results to supervisors or advisors is not required. This policy applies to all students and personnel at UCSF and UCSF Health, regardless of whether you are working on-site or remotely, paid or unpaid. It will remain in effect until further notice. UCSF is committed to protecting your personal health information. All COVID-19 test results will be kept strictly confidential and used only for limited, health-related purposes, including contact tracing and other activities to address employee, student, and patient safety as directed by UCSF OHS and Infection Prevention Services. Test results will be kept only in the appropriate health records, separate from personnel files or student records. [Click here to learn more](https://coronavirus.ucsf.edu/campus-protocols#diagnosis) about the self-reporting policy. Questions about this policy can be addressed to UCSF OHS at (415) 514-7328 or [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#650a0d1625100616034b000110). 2. Work Resumes on Essential UCSF Construction Projects UCSF resumed work on essential construction projects at sites around San Francisco on April 14, 2020. In addition, we will continue working on projects that were launched in direct support of the needs of our COVID-19 response. The decision to resume work on essential projects is in accordance with current local and statewide shelter-in-place orders, which allow exceptions for essential construction activities. Resuming these essential construction and maintenance projects will help UCSF meet the needs of our patients, researchers, trainees, and the wider community during and after the current public health crisis. UCSF is committed to safeguarding the health of the construction and maintenance workers, as well as the health of the surrounding communities. We are working closely with all the contractors involved in these projects to ensure their work complies with the San Francisco Department of Public Health's [Directive on Construction Safety](https://www.sfdph.org/dph/alerts/files/Construction-Industry-DirectiveOrder-040220.pdf), including the requirement to maintain physical distancing to prevent transmission of the virus. UCSF is also working with our contractors to ensure that anyone exposed to or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, or anyone who tests positive for the novel coronavirus, remains at home until they are cleared to return to work. Despite the unprecedented challenges created by COVID-19, UCSF's mission remains unchanged. We are committed to providing excellent patient care, pursuing path-breaking research, and training the next generation of scientists and patient care providers. 3. Governor Outlines Plan to Reopen State Yesterday, Gov. Newsom outlined a framework to determine when the state and local communities can begin to resume work, school, and other activities. The timing will depend on the progress we make toward [six indicators](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/California-Roadmap-to-Modify-the-Stay-at-Home-Order.pdf), and the governor pledged to make any decisions in concert with local public health authorities and other city and county leaders. For more details, please see the governor's [press release](http://www.oesnews.com/governor-newsom-outlines-six-critical-indicators-the-state-will-consider-before-modifying-the-stay-at-home-order-and-other-covid-19-interventions/).
