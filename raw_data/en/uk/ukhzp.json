It is anticipated that this virus will continue to circulate in some form for the foreseeable future, and the CDC may recommend additional vaccination or booster shots depending on how the situation develops. The Davidson College COVID team consults with infectious disease experts, watches state and local trends, uses CDC guidelines and considers previous campus experience at Davidson and elsewhere to make decisions about campus policy. As in the past, all of these guidelines are subject to revision based on changes in the circumstances in our community and the state. We continue to move toward an environment similar to campus before the pandemic and appreciate your efforts and your support of our shared obligation to each other. COVID Guidelines Masks on Campus We're grateful to our community for respecting one another and our differing situations. COVID is now a disease that we manage, as we do others. Given this context, the Core COVID Response Team has decided that each student, staff or faculty member makes their own decision about whether to mask. This approach is now consistent with our practice in other venues and gatherings on campus. If you have a medical condition that requires extraordinary steps, please contact [Human Resources](/offices-and-services/human-resources) about possible accommodations. Vaccinations As of May 11, 2023, the college will no longer require COVID vaccines, but will continue to highly recommend them in accordance with CDC guidelines. COVID vaccinations help minimize complications and protect those who are unable to be vaccinated. COVID Testing We will continue to offer self-testing at the Health Center Monday-Friday from 8-11:30 a.m. and 1-4:30 p.m. during the academic year. We will set up a COVID testing picnic table outside the [Center for Student Health & Well-Being](/about/campus-spaces/student-life-facilities/student-health-center). Students with upper respiratory symptoms can make an appointment and will test outside before their appointment. A student who tests positive will use a room reserved for those who test positive. Isolation Students who test positive should refer to the [on-campus COVID isolation in place](/offices-and-services/student-health-and-well-being/health-services/covid-19/campus-covid-isolation-place) guide. This will provide information about isolation, will outline resources you may need while in isolation, and will describe mitigation strategies to decrease your risk of infecting others. We continue to follow CDC guidance. "}
