Since the human body is 75 percent water, fluid loss can disrupt heart rhythms and leave sufferers lightheaded, weak or confused. Falls are common in older individuals who become dehydrated. Common triggers for dehydration include fever, diarrhea and vomiting. About 20 percent of people with dementia suffer from chronic, asymptomatic urinary tract infections that can cause fluid loss. Aging affects hormones that regulate fluid balance, as do many common medications. \"Many elderly people are on diuretic mediations for high blood pressure, congestive heart failure or kidney disease,\" says Alan Jon Smally, M.D., medical director of Emergency Medicine at Hartford Hospital. \"They're already borderline dehydrated, but their medications decrease feelings of thirst and they don't drink enough water.\" Signs that the body is trying to conserve water: sunken facial features dry skin reduced urine output and concentrated urine Blood tests often reveal an electrolyte imbalance in dehydrated individuals. Sodium and po - tassium are vital to cellular activity and transmission of electrical signals to the brain, nervous system and muscles. An electrolyte imbalance can lead to an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), kidney failure, coma or death. dry mouth muscle cramps dizziness and weaknessMoisturizer Mystery What's in those moisturizers we slather all over our bodies every winter? More than $45 billion is spent annually on cosmetics and toiletries in the United States alone. Amid scares over tainted prod - ucts, consumers have begun to worry about the total lack of regulation of cosmetics by the federal government. Personal care products are being increasingly outsourced to overseas manufacturers. Moisturizers are classified as cosmetics by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which only requires safety and efficacy tests for drugs. The FDA does not review cosmetic products or ingredients for safety before they're sold to the public, and has no legal authority to recall hazardous products. Most moisturizers stay on top of the skin, but now they're being created by manipulating chemicals at the atomic level. Marketers claim that tiny nanospheres\u2014a million times smaller than a grain of sand\u2014 penetrate deep beneath the skin to deliver moisture to dry skin. Emerging research suggests that untested moisturizers and lotions may contain toxic chemicals that promote cancer, impair fertility or damage the repro - ductive system.

Dry Spells 2The rapid pace of a hospital emergency room creates a particularly hectic setting for physicians writing medi - cation orders for high-risk patients. Hartford Hospital recently added a pharmacist to its emergency department (ED) team, becoming one of only a handful of leading hos - pitals with a pharmacy specialist on site during peak hours. Amid the demanding urgency of an emergency room, emergency medicine specialists are called upon to write prescriptions for a wide range of illnesses and injuries. More than two-thirds of adverse drug effects in emergency departments nationwide are preventable, according to a recent study at the University of Rochester. \"Last year we treated 83,000 patients in the ED, which is more than 225 people every day,\" says Alan Jon Smally, M.D., medical director of Emergency Medicine at Hartford Hospital. \"The ED pharmacist not only helps prevent medication errors, but also can suggest a drug that is more affordable, yet just as effective.\" National studies have shown that the addition of an ED pharmacist can potentially save lives, as well as millions of dollars each year. In addition to enhancing patient safety, an ED pharmacist can suggest more cost-effective ways to deliver medication when appropriate, such as providing a drug in pill form rather than the expensive intravenous equivalent. \"Our clinical pharmacist provides nurses with knowledge- based information about medications during resuscitations,\" says Director of Emergency Services & Life Star Jonathon Brown, MBA, MSN, RN. \"Her presence provides nurses with Rx for the ED an onsite resource, ensuring that we keep our patients safe, as well as managing medication administration.\" Pharmacist Gabrielle Jacknin, Pharm.D., spends eight hours a day in Hartford Hospital's ED, reviewing high-risk medication orders, responding to traumas and resuscita - tions, consulting with physicians and educating patients about their medications. \"Hartford Hospital's ED is very busy, averaging over 600 orders written daily for medica - tions,\" she says. \"Combining this high volume with the stressful nature of the patients being seen and minimal patient history, the safety mechanisms that the rest of the hospital employs are put to the test in the ED.\" \"The ED pharmacist is available in an advisory role dur - ing the busiest time of day to provide information about medications ranging from antibiotics to asthma medica - tions or pain management for fractures or trauma,\" adds Michael Rubino, M.S., R.Ph., director of Pharmacy Services. \"With the addition of an emergency pharmacist, Hartford Hospital is adding another layer of safety in caring for patients, as the pharmacist can help ensure that medicines can be safely combined.\" 3GI Blues Members of the GI team include (left to right) Michael J. Golioto, M.D., Shawn Simmonds, GI Tech, Jeffry L. Nestler, M.D., and Michael Karasik, M.D.When your belly aches, everything hurts. Across the nation, stomachs are rumbling as waist - lines widen. Bloating, heartburn and constipation disproportionately afflict overweight and obese individuals, who now account for an estimated two- thirds of the population. One in three American adults regularly battles gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort, belching, nausea, gas, constipation or diarrhea. While everyone suffers from occasional heart - burn, overeating puts a strain on the digestive sys - tem, the complex internal plumbing that stretches from the esophagus to the stomach, gallbladder, pancreas, liver and intestines. Holiday tables are laden with rich desserts and alcoholic beverages that can trigger heartburn radiating from the throat to the abdomen. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a widespread disorder, afflicting nearly 20 million Americans. Acid reflux can carve deep ulcers in the lining of the esophagus that bleed or cause atypi - cal symptoms like chest pain, laryngitis or asthma. Pain and pressure worsen at night, disrupting sleep with choking and burning sensations that may require medication or minimally invasive surgery. Hartford Hospital's long-standing commit - ment to technological innovation ensures that the Gastroenterology Division has the most advanced medical technology available anywhere. Hartford Hospital's nearly 20 Board-certified gastroenterolo - gists are familiar with even the rarest conditions and skilled in the most uncommon procedures. Even patients with unusual or difficult conditions can obtain specialized care without having to travel long distances from home. The hospital offers expert diagnosis and treat - ment using state-of-the-art endoscopic instruments with high-definition images and narrow-band image capability for improved detection and diagnosis of precancerous lesions. Sophisticated digital fluoros - copy and radiology equipment delivers the highest- quality images with the lowest radiation exposure. Innovative impedance measuring techniques mean vastly improved diagnosis and treatment for pa - tients with reflux and chest pain. Down the Tube New surveillance protocols let physicians keep a watchful eye on precancerous changes in the lining Hartford Hospital's latest innovation, SpyGlass, now permits direct live-time, color-filled views inside the dark world of the bile ducts to reveal secrets once only seen in shadows and grayscale. of the esophagus. The incidence of esophageal can - cer has soared over the past 30 years and is rising faster than any other cancer in adults. Diagnosis usually involves a technique called upper endoscopy, which lets physicians examine or biopsy suspicious lesions or tumors of the esophagus, stomach or duo - denum (the top section of the small intestine). GI specialists snake the endoscope\u2014a lighted, flexible tube with a miniature camera\u2014down the throat to the stomach and beyond. Hartford Hospital's GI specialists offer experi - ence and expertise in diagnosing and treating complex digestive disorders. Patients with unex - plained bleeding can swallow a capsule containing a tiny wireless video camera that sends images of the inside of the small intestine to a data recorder. Innovative imaging techniques allow gastroen - terologists to explore intricate networks that carry bile into the upper intestine. The liver is a large organ that, among other things, makes bile to aid in digestion. The GI team, which includes specially trained physicians, nurses, and technicians, em - ploys specialized techniques for opening narrow or scarred ducts with narrow plastic or mesh tubes called stents that allow digestive juices to flow. Trapped gallstones can be removed with a variety of metal baskets and plastic balloons. \"Hartford Hospital is the leading center for com - plex gastrointestinal referrals in the region,\" says Jeffry L. Nestler, M.D., who heads the Division of Gastroenterology. \"We're a high-volume center with cutting-edge technology and great depth of experi - ence in treating diseases of the pancreas (including pancreatic cancer and complex pancreatitis) and the bile ducts, such as gallstones and tumors.\" \"When necessary, minimally invasive surgery can be performed by reaching fiberoptic scopes and instruments down the throat to remove an obstruc - tion,\" explains Dr. Nestler. \"The tube-like bile ducts are only about three millimeters in diameter\" (about an eighth of an inch wide). Endscopy Expertise At Hartford Hospital, an advanced tech - nique called endoscopic retrograde cholangio\u00ad pancreatography (ERCP) combines endoscopy with X-ray imaging to diagnose and treat diseases of the gallbladder, bile ducts, pancreas and liver. The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ that stores \u2014Michael J. Golioto, M.D. 5PHYSICIAN PROFILE Jeffry L. Nestler, M.D Jeffry L. Nestler, M.D., is director of the Division of Gastroenterology at Hartford Hospital and president of Connecticut GI, P.C. He is the vice president of the Hartford Hospital Medical Staff. Board-certified in gas - troenterology and internal medicine, he is managing partner and medi - cal director of the Connecticut GI Endoscopy Center. Dr. Nestler is an assistant clinical professor of medi - cine at the University of Connecticut. A cum laude graduate of Tufts University, he earned his medical degree at New York Medical College in Valhalla, New York. He completed his residency in Internal Medicine and a fellowship in the division of digestive diseases at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. He joined Hartford Hospital in 1990. Dr. Nestler specializes in therapeu - tic endoscopy (ERCP) for pancrea - ticobiliary disease. He also has an interest in esophageal motility disor - ders and gastroesophageal reflux dis - ease (GERD). He has brought several new technologies to the institution to diagnose and treat these disorders. In his spare time, he enjoys basket - ball, tennis and travel with his family. bile until it is needed for digestion. \"We can enlarge the opening of a duct, put a stent in place to permit the duct to drain, remove gallstones trapped in the duct or obtain tissue samples of the bile duct or pancreas for biopsy,\" says Dr. Nestler. Most patients undergo an endoscopic procedure for upper-abdominal pain, pancreatitis, jaundice or unexplained weight loss. ERCP is also effective for diagnosis and treat - ment of bile and pancreatic duct blockages caused by stones or obstructions (\"strictures\"). Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is similar to an upper endoscopy exam, but the scope is also equipped with ultrasound technology that allows physicians to use the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum as a window to view a detailed image of the inside of the body. Each year, GI specialists at Hartford Hospital perform 600 diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP and 600 EUS proce - dures, making the hospital a world-class center for diagnosis and treatment of pancreaticobiliary disorders that affect the pancreas, liver, gallbladder and bile ducts. \"We also use EUS to examine the digestive tract and nearby organs, or to perform a fine-needle biopsy with the endoscope,\" states Dr Nestler. \"This advanced technique allows better views and safer passage of the biopsy needle to answer the most seri - ous of medical issues\u2014such as the diagnosis of a gastroin - testinal cancer\u2014accurately and efficiently.\" Through the SpyGlass The newest endoscopic technology, called SpyGlass, al- lows a miniaturized instrument to be passed into the deep - est recesses of the bile duct. Ultrasound images obtained from within the digestive tract provide unique insights into abdominal organs. The 6,000-pixel fiberoptic probe acquires and transmits images to a computer screen in real-time to clarify diagnoses and guide therapeutic interventions. The innovative direct-visualization procedure creates a detailed image of the inside of the body that can reveal tumors of the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, gall bladder and liver, as well as bile duct obstructions. Tumors growing within the confines of distant and small bile ducts can for the first time be directly seen and targeted for biopsy, with - out any guesswork or approximation. In addition to earlier and more accurate detection of le - sions, SpyGlass can be used for therapy. Once inside the bile duct with the instrument, physicians can break apart large gallstones trapped within the duct using electrohydraulic energy under direct visualization. Previously, such stones required surgery, rather than endoscopy, for removal. By visualizing the stone, contacting it and using \"shockwaves\" to destroy large stones, the GI team can provide the most minimally invasive option possible. 6\"The SpyGlass allows the physician to biopsy suspi - cious areas directly,\" adds Hartford Hospital Director of Endoscopy Joseph Cappa, M.D. \"Conventional CAT scans sometimes miss GI tumors, but if we view and detect a small cancer early, we can often prevent its spread and dramatically alter management and outcome.\" Inflammatory Insights The GI system is woefully susceptible to inflammatory diseases that cause debilitating abdominal pain, cramping, fatigue and sudden, embarrassing bouts of bloody diarrhea. Nearly a million Americans suffer from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease and ulcer - ative colitis, both of which cause chronic inflammation of the intestine. IBD often occurs in tandem with other autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, including asthma and multiple sclerosis. Inflammation is the body's instinctive response to invading pathogens. When the body battles a non-existent threat and the over-reactive defense system turns on itself, the result is a chronic \"autoimmune\" disease. Crohn's dis - ease\u2014named for Burrill Crohn, the physician who discov-ered it in 1932\u2014causes inflammation and ulceration (open sores) in the intestines. Nearly half a million Americans suffer from the mysterious disease. While ulcerative colitis is limited to the colon and rectum, Crohn's disease can strike anywhere from the mouth to the anus. The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center at Hartford Hospital is the only center in the state focused intensively on this challenging and complex disorder. The expert, in - terdisciplinary team employs the latest diagnostic tech - niques to evaluate complex cases and devise treatment plans. French researchers recently discovered that patients with Crohn's disease lack naturally occurring bacteria that secrete anti-inflammatory compounds, suggesting that this deficiency may trigger the disorder by over-stimulating the immune system. Anti-inflammatory drugs, immune system suppressants, antibiotics and surgery offer relief to many, but not all, patients. Clues in Your DNA Each individual's genetic blueprint contains thousands of genes that code for specific proteins. Pharmaceutical companies are studying genes, enzymes and growth factor receptors, seeking novel drug therapies aimed at mo - lecular targets. American and Canadian researchers have identified a major gene\u2014especially common in people of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish descent\u2014associated with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The gene for a receptor of a protein called interleukin-23, or IL-23, is significantly different in people with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis compared with healthy people. Hartford Hospital's Dr. Cappa and Dr. Michelle Smedley served as investigators in a multicenter clinical trial\u2014 the Study of Patients with Crohn's Disease Na\u00efve to Immunomodulators and Biologic Therapy (SONIC)\u2014that the benefit of Remicade (infliximab), ei - ther alone or in combination with Imuran (azathioprine). Remicade, a monoclonal antibody that binds to the immune system's tumor necrosis factor (TNF), is a powerful drug that keeps the body from triggering the exaggerated inflamma - tion response characteristic of autoimmune diseases. \"Hartford Hospital participated in an interna - tional study, presented at the national meeting of the American College of Gastroenterology in October, that may revolutionize how we take care of Crohn's disease patients in the future,\" adds Dr. Cappa. \"Nearly half a mil - lion Americans have Crohn's disease. Most are on multiple medications and miss a lot of work. Not only am I excited about the efficacy of new biological treatments, but the role of genetics\u2014almost standard practice in the treat - ment of moderate to severe Crohn's disease\u2014is considered 'experimental' in other fields.\" \"Recent advances allow us to customize medication dosage for an individual patient based on their genetic predisposition to metabolize Imuran (azathioprine),\" says Hartford Hospital gastroenterologist Michelle Smedley, M.D. \"We do genetic testing to tailor the dose to how a patient metabolizes the drug. It's the beginning of 'personalized' medicine. We're ahead of the curve compared with other diseases in terms of using your genetics to make safer and more effective use of a particular drug.\" The innovative SpyGlass direct visualization device is used for both detection and therapy. 7 | in the DOCTOR'S OFFICE | WHAT'S GOING AROUND...News & Breakthroughs Going Green Green tea is rich in antioxi - dants called catechins that can help stave off weight gain\u2014at least in mice\u2014 according to The Journal of Nutrition. University of Connecticut scientists found that mice fed green tea extracts burned more fat and had fewer fatty de - posits in their livers. Dutch researchers have shown that green tea improves weight management in women.Cirrhosis is a chronic and progressive disease that overwhelms the liver's ability to heal and regenerate. Fatty cells and fibrous scar tissue clog the swollen organ, blocking blood flow and disrupting vital functions. When your liver stops work - ing, you die. Cirrhosis begins with fatigue, weakness and loss of appetite. As the disease pro - gresses, the normally resilient organ loses its ability to make proteins, fight infection, digest food and store energy. Ultimately, fluid distends the belly, and the skin takes on a grim yellow tinge as the ruined organ loses its battle to rid the body of toxins. \"Cirrhosis causes degenerative and irreversible changes in the liver,\" says Jonathan Israel, M.D., a gastroenterologist at Hartford Hospital. \"Early treatment can often slow the progression of the disease, but fibrous tissue permanently scars the liver. End-stage liver failure occurs when the liver is so damaged that it can't regenerate, neces - sitating an organ transplant.\" \"Cirrhosis is Latin for scarring,\" adds transplant surgeon Anne Lally, M.D. \"Each year, we perform up to 30 liver transplants at Hartford Hospital. The sicker you are, the higher up on the trans - plant list you go. How long you wait for a transplant depends on your blood group and availability of an organ. Hepatitis C and alcohol abuse are the leading reasons for a transplant.\" Although most cases of cirrhosis result from long-term alcohol abuse, the liver can also be destroyed by infection with chronic Cirrhosis: Treating Liver Disease viral hepatitis B or C, autoimmune hepatitis, blocked bile ducts, toxins and inherited diseases. Women drinkers can develop cirrhosis from as few as two to three drinks a day. Occasionally the cause of the disease remains unknown even when fluid retention in the legs and abdomen, jaundice (yellow - ing of the skin) or gallstones signal that the liver is failing. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, marked by fat deposits and inflammation in the liver, is often silent. Once the progression is underway, however, liver damage may be irreversible. Research shows that drugs for diabetes and cholesterol, along with exer - cise and weight loss, may help prevent seri - ous complications from fatty liver disease. Metabolic syndrome\u2014marked by obesity, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and high blood sugar\u2014often precedes liver damage. \"Obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes are risk factors for cirrhosis,\" says Dr. Israel. \"In people who are morbidly obese, abnormal liver function tests from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease may signal that they're candidates for bariatric (weight loss) surgery.\" About 20 to 25 percent of individuals infected with hepatitis C go on to develop the telltale abdominal swelling, sleepiness and cloudy thinking of advanced cirrhosis. Since hepatitis C often lurks in the body for years without symptoms, people may be shocked to learn from routine laboratory results that they have been infected with a potentially fatal, incurable disease. Once the liver begins to fail, transplant may be the only option. Don't Blame Mom New research shows that baldness results from more than just a faulty androgen gene on the X chromosome (inherited from the mother). Nature Genetics reports that male-pattern bald - ness, which afflicts 40% of men, has also been linked to chromosome 20 (inher - ited from both mother and father), which may explain hair loss similarities in fathers and sons.Smokers Age Faster Researchers in Finland found that cigarette smoking not only shortens lifespan, but also significantly reduces quality of life, reports the Archives of Internal Medicine. A long-term study showed that Helsinki businessmen who smoked heavily suffered significant physical limita - tions in old age compared with those who had never smoked.Shark Attack Antibodies derived from shark blood may someday provide a new generation of targeted cancer drugs. Australian researchers created disease-fighting shark antibodies that bind to cancer cells to stop them from spreading. The discovery may someday lead to a pill, since genetically modified shark antibodies can withstand the human gut's acidic conditions. Anne Lally, M.D. 8As random thoughts swirl wildly through their minds, teenagers with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) struggle to concentrate or even sit still. School becomes a grim battleground of distractibility and defi - ance that often sets the stage for lifelong failure. ADHD afflicts an estimated five to eight percent of kids. Teenagers with ADHD are more likely than their peers to experiment with drugs and alcohol and to display delinquent behavior. Parents and kids are blamed and shamed as they journey from therapist to probation officer, judge and psychiatrist. Evidence continues to mount that teenagers who suf - fer from ADHD aren't intentionally disruptive or lazy, but instead are tormented by their inability to concentrate. Impulsive, hyperactive and distractible, they're often lonely and unpopular in the classroom. Although Ritalin and other psychostimulants help many kids concentrate in school, they aren't always effective, and aren't easily tolerated by some children. Using sophisticated, non-invasive tools like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), researchers at the Institute of Living (IOL) have spent seven years mapping the brain and measuring activity in the crucial prefrontal cortex. \"What we're learning about brain structure and neural functioning in ADHD teenagers shows that ADHD is undoubtedly real and related to how the brain works,\" says Michael C. Stevens, Ph.D., director of Child & Adolescent re - search at the IOL's Olin Neuropsychiatry Research Center and assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Yale University. \"ADHD is unbelievably disruptive in terms of poor out - comes and substance abuse. School officials sometimes don't want to hear that kids with behavioral problems need more structure and support or that the kids' neurobiology keeps them from becoming motivated and engaged. But this is a very real fact that numerous clinical neuroscience studies are helping us to understand.\" Neuroimaging reveals distinctive anatomical and struc - tural differences in the brains of kids with ADHD, but what role does heredity play? Dr. Stevens recently won a presti - gious $2-million grant from the National Institutes of Health for a five-year genetic study, following up on fMRI research funded by an initial Hartford Hospital grant in 2004. Will the unraveling of the human DNA blueprint ultimately explain why some kids with ADHD are dreamy and distracted, while others are impulsive and reckless? \"ADHD seems like a single disorder if you look at a waiting room full of kids that can be helped by psychostimulant medications,\" says Dr. Stevens. \"But genes may explain the characteristic dif - ferences in brain function we see with fMRI. Kids with ADHD have fundamental dissimilarities in how their brains work to control impulsive behavior.\" Using the analogy of a car spinning out of control, Dr. Stevens says kids with ADHD have either bad brakes or too much gas . The combination of fMRI and genetic research may show whether genotypes place children at risk for abnormal brain function that, in turn, leads to ADHD symptoms and behaviors. \"We already know that certain genes influence how the brain works,\" he explains. \"The purpose of our cur - rent research is to identify how these two different 'brakes' and 'gas' neural systems both might lead to ADHD impulsive - ness. Someday we hope to tailor ADHD treatment by using both genetic testing and fMRI.\" Dr. Stevens is seeking 130 teenagers diagnosed with ADHD with impulsivity to undergo interview/cognitive testing, provide a saliva sample and undergo a noninvasive fMRI scan (no substance abusers, autism or medications for depression).

Creativity and effort are flowing through my body urging me to use them. I'm a good learner\u2014that is, if I want to be. I can understand things and remember them if I am focused. I catch on quickly, but I'm impatient. Sometimes I don't apply myself to homework or class work because I don't want to. I have trouble concentrating if I don't take breaks. People always tell me I should change or that I should pay attention, but they don't understand that the way I learn is very unique. \u2014Self \u00adevaluation by a teenager with ADHD 9DATELINE: Iraq It is balmy in Iraq today and a welcome relief. What follows are some thoughts, fragmented and in disorder, much like this experience. The Road to Iraq We began with non-stop training by the 1st Army, whose motto is, \"We don't ship stupid.\" Among the many things we gained at McCoy was an appreciation for the protective equipment. It weighs at least 40 lbs and we were soaking wet with sweat after just a few minutes in the heat. It surely saves lives, but it took weeks to acclimate to the weight of it. Unfortunately, extremities remain vulnerable, as well as the face and neck. Still, the gear, as hot as it is in this environ - ment, is a major factor in our patients arriving alive. \"This is not a Drill\" Those were some of the last words we heard as we boarded the plane and headed to Kuwait. Somewhere in the distance I could hear the old song, Baby, You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet. I took both as signals that there was no frame of reference for what was ahead. We are convinced that Kuwait has its own equator and sun. Surely it is one of the hottest and most inhospitable places on earth, with temperatures consistently above 130\u00b0. Upon ven - turing out of a tent, we had to know exactly how far we would have to go to reach the next covered area. The environment is harsh and the plumbing is primitive (essentially none, requir - ing 50,000 gallons of water to be trucked in daily). Our living quarters there was tent #17, which we referred to as Stalag 17. Our Work It was good to arrive in Iraq, where the heat is less intense, where we have been able to settle into our work at the 325th Combat Support Hospital (CSH). The most difficult patient situations that we face are victims of improvised explosive de - vice (IED) attacks. IEDs are the signature weapon of this war. Head, extremity injury and traumatic amputations are the sig - nature injuries. These blast injuries are unimagined in civilian by Maria Tackett, RN, MSN, CCRN, CEN My Iraq Journal 10Maria Tackett is nurse director for Hartford Hospital's Emergency Department, Flight, Trauma, Neurosurgery and Neurology. She is a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve. work, particularly since they often involve more than one extremity and several sites of injury. One day, we were caring for two men whose vehicle was hit by an IED. This blast sends up a vertical force, as opposed to VBIEDs (vehicle-borne IEDs) whose energy is dis - sipated laterally. The force of the blast propelled two men out of their seven-ton vehicle. The man in the turret position is especially vulnerable. As we were working with him, we could smell fuel, which we realized was the accelerant from the IED. We are able to treat civilians who have life-threatening injuries. They are coalition forces or civilians working for or against the U.S. This, at times, has included detainees and prisoners We also care for people with non-battle injuries that include crashes. One young civilian sustained a non-survivable head injury. Had the outcome been more hopeful, we would have sent him onto Balad. Instead, he stayed with us as the inevitable and unforgiving effect of severe head trauma unfolded. Whether here or at Hartford Hospital, seeing his father at the bedside needed no translation\u2014a compelling image that transcends the barriers of language and culture.One of our most memorable situations came when we received a young woman from a village who developed a serious bleed - ing problem while undergoing a C-section. An Army Black Hawk helicopter brought her here after the village hospital asked for help. She arrived in Stage IV shock, barely alive. Here we are in the Iraq desert, far from a high-risk center, with one OB doc, a few surgeons and a few nurses. After many, many units of blood, she was stable enough to leave the CSH. We hear that the baby, cared for at the originating facility, did well. We had to have won some hearts and minds. Our scope of practice has also broadened in other ways. The veterinarians have come by to treat Army working dogs at the CSH. These dogs are treated like soldiers, and the connection between the dog and the handler is intense. There are over 40,000 snakebites in Iraq each year. Our practice has also been broadened by training to treat snake and scorpion bites. Surgeries here are focused on damage control and are time- limited, so only immediate stabilization is done. Two of the nurses have sons serving in Iraq now and one young nurse's father is here. Their skills and ability to impro - vise in this setting get us through even the most unfamiliar challenges. Some of the nurses are very young, as are many of the medics, and I am humbled by their commitment and the sacrifices, big and small, that they make. Our hearts were broken by the devastating news of the death of 21-year-old Corporal Jeremy Bouffard of Middlefield, Mass. He was killed along with 13 other men in a helicopter crash as they were returning from a night mission in Iraq. Jeremy was the son of Lt. Col. Steve Bouffard, the chief nurse of the 405th Combat Support Hospital. Steve is an outstanding chief nurse and a constant source of encouragement throughout our work. He was very proud of Jeremy. While nothing totally prepares you to be here, several aspects of trauma hold true in this setting\u2014the injured are young with no underlying disease and an amazing capacity for recov - ery. In many ways, we are closer to our clinical work here than at home. While the magnitude of the injuries, particularly those caused by explosives is daunting, the work itself never fails us. 11Call the Health/Physician Referral Service at (860) 545\u00ad1888 or (800) 545\u00ad7664 for information about any program.

Non Profit Organization U.S. Postage PAID Hartford, CT Permit No. 436180 S e y m o u r St r e e t Ha r t f o r d , Ct 06102-5037Cook's Circle Recipe analyzed by Brunella Ibarrola, MS, RD, CD \u00adN. Here's a light and easy heart-healthy recipe that evokes the cozy cinnamon- and-ginger aroma of gingerbread baking in the oven. To reduce fat and avoid the use of animal products, try an all-natural, organic or vegan butter substitute. Butter contains saturated fat and choles - terol, which most individuals would prefer to avoid. Research has shown that a diet rich in saturated fats raises LDL \"bad\" cholesterol levels, but the effect of cholesterol (found only in animal products) depends greatly on genetics. Even small amounts of dietary cholesterol can raise total serum cholesterol levels alarmingly in susceptible individu - als. Margarine created by hydrogenation is loaded with harmful trans fats, but today's butter substitutes have been re-engineered to be trans fat-free. Soy-based butter alternatives are marketed specifically to vegetarians and vegans (who don't eat meat, fish, dairy or eggs). The new spreads are also suitable for saut\u00e9ing, baking and cooking. You can also substitute soy or rice milk and search online for dairy-free gingerbread recipes.Place rack in center of oven and preheat to 350\u00b0. Butter and flour a 9-inch cake pan with 2-inch sides. Set aside. Combine the dry ingredients (flour, baking soda, salt, ground cinnamon, ginger and cloves) in a separate bowl. Set aside. In bowl of electric mixer or using a hand mixer with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy (about 3 minutes). Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each is added. Add the lemon zest and molasses and beat until combined. Alternate dry ingredi - ents and milk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Beat until barely blended. Pour the batter into the buttered and floured pan and smooth the top with an offset spatula. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Remove from oven and let cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes before removing cake from pan. Cool completely before frosting with lemon icing. Garnish with toasted whole walnuts. For Lemon Icing: Mix confectioners' sugar and lemon juice until smooth. (Icing should be thick, but still spreadable.) Pour the icing onto the center of the cake and spread with an offset spatula. Some of the icing will drip down the sides of the cake. Serves 12. * This recipe was tested using a vegan margarine (Earth Balance Organic Buttery Spread).Gingerbread CakeIngredients 2 cups all-purpose tsp. salt 1\u00bd tsp. ground cinnamon 1 tsp. ground ginger 1/8 tsp. ground cloves \u00bd cup butter substitute*\u00bd cup light brown sugar 2 large eggs zest of 1 lemon \u00bd cup unsulphured molasses 1 cup milk Lemon Icing (optional) 1\u00bd cups sifted confectioners' powdered sugar 2 to 2\u00bd Tbs. fresh lemon juice Calories: 200 Protein: 3.7 33 (62% monosaturated) Cholesterol: 31.6 mg Sodium: 215 mg "}
