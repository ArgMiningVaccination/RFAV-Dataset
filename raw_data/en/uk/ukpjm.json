Those responsibilities now reside within the Off ice of Security Policy and Industry Engagement's Surface Division. 1.1 Background and Purpose In executing its responsibility for national pipeline security, TSA originally utilized the Pipeline Security Information Circular, issued on September 5, 2002, by t he Department of Transportation's (DOT) Office of Pipeline Safety as the primary Federal guideline for industry security. Complementing this document, and also adopted by TSA, was the DOT -issued Pipeline Security Contingency Planning Guidance of June 2002. Recognizing that the Security Circular required updating, TSA initiated a process to amend the Federal security guidance. The 2010 Pipeline Security Guidelines were developed with the assistance of industry and government members of the Pipeline Sector a nd Government Coordinating Councils, industry association representatives, and other interested parties. This document was soon revised resulting in the 2011 Pipeline Security Guidelines. The advancement of security practices to meet the ever changing thr eat environment in both the physical and cyber security realms required that the guidelines be updated again. Utilizing a similar industry and government collaborative approach, TSA developed this document, which supersedes the 2011 version of the Pipeline Security Guidelines. The security measures in this guidance provide the basis for TSA's Pipeline Security Program Corporate Security Reviews and Critical Facility Security Reviews. This document is guidance and does not impose requirements on any person or company. The term \"should\" means that TSA recommends the actions described. Nothing in this document shall supersede Federal statutory or regulatory requirements. 1.2 Scope These guidelines are applicable to operational natural gas and hazardous liquid tra nsmission pipeline systems, natural gas distribution pipeline systems, and liquefied natural gas facility operators. Additionally, they apply to operational pipeline systems that transport materials categorized as toxic inhalation hazards (TIH). TIH materi als are gases or liquids that are known or presumed on the basis of tests to be so toxic to humans as to pose a health hazard in the event of a release during transportation. (See the Hazardous Materials Regulations: 49 CFR parts 171 -180.) TSA Pipeline Security Guidelines Corporate Security Program 2 Operators of pipeline systems not included in the descriptions above are encouraged to implement the security measures contained herein to the extent appropriate to their particular system . 2 CORPORATE SECURITY PROGRAM A risk-based corporate security program should be established and implemented by each pipeline operator to address and document the organization's policies and procedures for managing security related threats, incidents, and responses. In addition, each operator should: Develop a corporate security plan as described in Section 3; Ensure sufficient resources, to include trained staff and equipment, are provided to effectively execute the corporate security program; Ensure identified security deficiencies have appropriate financial resources allocated in the corporate budgeting and purchasing processes; Assign a qualified primary and alternate staff member to manage the corporate security program; Develop and maintain a cyber/Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) security plan, or incorporate cyber/SCADA security measures in the corporate security plan; Develop and maintain security elements within the corporate incident response and recovery plan; Implement appropriate threat level protective measures upon receipt of a pertinent National Terrorism Advisory System (NTAS) Bulletin or Alert; and Notify TSA of security incidents meeting the criteria provided in Appendix B by phone or email as soon as possible. Figure 1 identifies the major steps that each pipeline operator should take in creating and implementing a corporate security program and the relevant sections in the guidelines where specific details are provided. TSA Pipeline Security Guidelines Corporate Security Program 3 Pipeline operators should adopt baseline and enhanced security measures at each critical facility. (Sections 6 and 7) Pipeline operators should adopt baseline security measures at all facilities. (Sections 6 and 7) Pipeline operators should conduct a SVA for each critical facility.

As stated in the National Infrastructure Protection Plan, DHS assesses risk as a function of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences. With this in mind, the most effective security p rograms employ a risk management process that facilitates planning and decision making to mitigate risks for pipeline assets. General elements include: Assessments used to determine facility criticality; Threat assessments identifying known or potential adversaries; Vulnerability assessments identifying security weaknesses; Risk assessments (based on threat, vulnerability, and consequence, considering facility criticality assessment findings); Risk mitigation to determine and implement appropriate risk red uction countermeasures; and Ongoing risk management to monitor, reassess, and modify the program. Recognizing that there are multiple risk assessment methodologies, each operator should determine the process and methodology most appropriate for implementat ion of the corporate security plan at the facilities comprising their pipeline system. TSA may ask to review the operator's risk assessment methodology. 4.2 Criticality Assessment Determining facility criticality is an essential first step in the security ris k management process. Information and findings gathered in the criticality assessment assist operators with prioritizing assets and implementing risk reduction countermeasures. Operators should evaluate each operating facility within their system using the criteria outlined in Section 5.2 to determine or validate criticality. Operators should: Conduct facility criticality assessments on a periodic basis, not to exceed 18 months, for all facilities; Document the methodology used, and retain the criticality assessment until no longer valid; Conduct an SVA or the equivalent as outlined in Section 4.3 of this document for facilities determined to be critical; and Maintain and secure the company's list of critical facilities. The operator's list of c ritical facilities is subject to review and evaluation by TSA. Operators and TSA will work together towards concurrence on the facilities listed. TSA Pipeline Security Guidelines Risk Analysis 7 4.3 Security Vulnerability Assessment A security vulnerability assessment (SVA) is one of the risk assessment methodologies pipeline operators may choose. The SVA serves as a planning and decision support tool to assist security managers with identifying, eval uating, and prioritizing risks and determining effective security measures to mitigate threats and vulnerabilities to their critical facilities. Common steps performed while conducting an SVA include: Asset Characterization - identification of hazards and consequences of concern for the facility, its surroundings, and its supporting infrastructure; and identification of existing layers of protection; Threats Assessment - description of possible internal and external threats; Security Vulnerability Analysis - identification of potential security vulnerabilities and existing countermeasures and their level of effectiveness in reducing identified vulnerabilities; Risk Assessment - determination of the relative degree of risk to the facility in terms of the expected effect on each asset and the likelihood of success of an attack; and Countermeasures Analysis - comparison of strategies that reduce the probability of a successful attack or reduce the possible degree of success, strategies that enhance the degree of risk reduction, the capabilities and effectiveness of mitigation options, and the feasibility of the options. Operators of critical pipeline facilities should: Conduct an SVA or the equivalent on a periodic basis, not to exceed 36 months, and within 12 months after completion of a significant enhancement or modification to the facility; Conduct an SVA or the equivalent for newly identified or constructed critical facilities within 12 months of designation or after achieving operatio nal status. Document findings from each assessment and retain them until no longer valid; Implement appropriate findings from the SVA in a timely fashion but no later than 24 months after SVA completion; and Document the assessment methodology used and mak e the documentation available for TSA review upon request.TSA Pipeline Security Guidelines Criticality Change 1 (April 2021) 8 5 CRITICALITY 5.1 Introduction The objective in determining which pipeline facilities are critical is to ensure that reasonable appropriate security risk reduction measures are implement ed thereby reducing the impact of service disruptions to critical infrastructure and the public. 5.2 Facility Criticality The designation of critical pipeline facilities is a challenging task considering the diverse operational and market environments spanning the pipeline industry. Pipeline operators are uniquely positioned to understand the criticality of their operations and the infrastructure necessary to serve those functions. Pipeline companies should develop a written policy and procedure to identify critical facilities in accordance with their enterprise risk management process and the TSA guidance below. To aid operators in applying the guidance, the criteria are differentiated for each of the three major pipeline subsectors: natural gas distribution natural gas transmission (to include LNG peak shaving and satellite plants) hazardous liquid transmission Determination of pipeline critical facilities: TSA is responsible for notifying pipeline operators of TSA-designated critical pipeline systems. Operators should pay particular attention to identifying critical facilities on these systems. A pipeline facility is considered critical if it provides primary service to designated critical infrastructure and is determined by the operator to be a \"single point of failure\" (i.e., does not have redundancy or systematic backup). TSA defines a single point of failure as a facility that if rendered inoperable would degrade service to critical infrastructure to the point that the infrastructure would not be able to satisfactorily perform its critical mission. Operators are responsible for conducting an operational assessment and identifying specific pipeline facilities that are necessary for critical pipeline systems (as designated by TSA) to function. System redundancies, contingency plans and available mitigations may be considered when evaluating the criticality of a facility. If requested, operators should provide TSA documentation including how identified redundancies are evaluated. This documentation is protected from unauthorized disclosure as s ensitive security information . As external mutual aid is not under the control of the operator, it should not be considered as a contingency or mitigation factor when identifying critical facilities. Operators should coordinate with the appropriate internal company business functions, (e. g., sales, marketing, and rates (tariffs)) to identify pipeline feeds to potentially criticalTSA Pipeline Security Guidelines Criticality Change 1 (April 2021) 9 infrastructure, including large volume customers such as natural gas-fired power generation plants, military bases and defense industrial base manufacturers. Operators may take into consideration whether firm or interruptible contracts are in place. In general, contracts for interruptible service may indicate the dependency on a fuel source is not vital to that critical infrastructure; however, this assumption should be validated with owners of said critical infrastructure. Operators may consider adjustments based on the severity of consequences as a result of the loss of a facility or disruption in service (e.g., climate conditions, restart capability and life-safety ). Operators may consider their ability to continue operations (e.g., product free flow or alternate or redundant prime-mover capacity) as an adequate facility backup as long as they demonstrate no impact to deliverability. TSA, in consultation with pipeline operators, may designate specific pipeline facilities as critical in accordance with this guidance. Operators may set more stringent criteria and designate facilities as critical in addition to those meeting the guidance below. A pipeline facility is defined as new and existing pipelines, rights of way, and any equipment, facility, or building used in the transportation of gas or hazardous liquids or in the treatment of gas or hazardous liquids during the course of transportation.1 Critical facilities may in clude, but are not limited to: pipeline interconnections metering and/or regulating stations pump stations compressor stations operational control facilities main line valves tank farms, terminals If damage or destruction of a facility has the potential to meet at least one of the following criteria , the facility or facilities should be designated as critical. 1 Consistent with definitions in 49 CFR \u00a7 192.3, 193.2007 and 195.2.

Operators shoul d develop and implement both baseline a nd enhanced security measures at each of their critical facilities. Table 2 identifies the baseline and enhanced security measures for operators to implement at appropriate pipeline facilities. Recurring actions are summarized in Appendix A. 6.3 Site-Specific Security Measures Operators should develop, document, and implement site -specific security measures for each of their critical facilities. These measures should be tailored explicitly for each facility and address specific action s to be taken in response to pertinent NTAS Bulletins or Alerts. On a periodic basis, not to exceed 18 months, these site -specific security measures should be reviewed and updated as necessary. TSA Pipeline Security Guidelines Facility Security Measur es 17 Table 2 : Baseline and Enhanced Security Measures BASELINE SECURITY MEASURESENHANCED SECURITY MEASURESPhysical Security and Access Control Fencing / Barriers Employ measures to impede unauthorized access to facilities. Create a security perimeter that impedes unauthorized vehicles from entering the facility perimeter or critical areas by installing and maintaining barriers (e.g., fences, bollards, jersey barriers, or equivalent.) Maintain fences, if used, without gaps around gates or underneath the fence line. Ensure that there is a clear zone for several feet on either side of the fence, free of obstructions, vegetation, or objects that could be used for concealment or to scale the fence. Access Controls Employ measures to impede unauthorized persons from gaining access to a facility and restricted areas within a facility. Implement procedures (such as manual or electronic sign in/out) for controlling access to the facility and restricted buildings or areas within the facility. Close and secure perimeter gates or entrances when not in use. Monitor and escort visitors at critical facilities. Post \"No Trespassing\" or \"Authorized Personnel Only\" signs at intervals that are visible from any point of potential entry. Gates Install and maintain gates of an equivalent quality to the barrier to which they are attached. Locks and Key Control Establish and document key control procedures for key issuance, tracking, collection, loss, and unauthorized duplication. Use patent keys to prevent unauthorized duplication. Conduct key inventories every 24 months.

TSA Pipeline Security Guidelines Pipeline Cyber Asset Security Measures 22 7 PIPELINE CYBER ASSET SECURITY MEASURES 7.1 Introduction The operational technology used by the operators to manage their infrastructure and products are vital to the pipeline system's safe and efficient operation. \"Operational technologies\" (OT) are the systems that detect or cause a change through the direct monitoring and/or control of physical devices, processes and events in the pipelines. OT systems include control systems (SCADA, process control systems (PCS), distributed control systems (DCS)), measurement systems and telemetry systems, which are collectively referred to as \"pipeline cyber assets.\" The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, a set of standards and best practices to assist organizations in managing cybersecurity risks and to promote the prot ection of critical infrastructure. To implement an effective cybersecurity strategy, pipeline operators should consider the approach outlined in the NIST Framework and the guidance issued by DHS and the Department of Energy along with industry -specific or other established methodologies, standards, and best practices (see Section 7.4). 7.2 Pipeline Cyber Assets Classification Operators should evaluate pipeline cyber assets and classify them using the following criteria: Critical pipeline cyber assets are OT s ystems that can control operations on the pipeline. Baseline and enhanced security measures should be applied to these assets. Non-critical pipeline cyber assets are OT systems that monitor operations on the pipeline. Baseline security measures should be a pplied to these assets. 7.3 Security Measures for Pipeline Cyber Assets Table 3 shows the baseline and enhanced cybersecurity measures that pipeline operators should apply to pipeline cyber assets based on their criticality designation. These measures incorpo rate updates to the previous TSA Pipeline Security Guidelines as well as recommendations and practices from the government and industry documents listed in Section 7.4. The cybersecurity guidelines that follow are organized according to the relevant functi ons and categories presented in the NIST Framework. TSA Pipeline Security Guidelines Pipeline Cyber Asset Security Measures Table 3: Baseline and Enhanced Cyber Security Measures 23 Baseline Security Measures Enhanced Security Measures Identify Asset Management Establish and document policies and procedures for assessing and maintaining configuration information, for tracking changes made to the pipeline cyber assets, and for patching/upgrading operating systems and applications. Ensure that the changes do not adversely impact existing cybersecurity controls. Employ mechanisms to maintain accurate inventory and to detect unauthorized components. Develop and maintain a comprehensive set of Review network connections periodically, network/system architecture diagrams or other including remote and third party connections. documentation, including nodes, interfaces, remote and third party connections, and Develop a detailed inventory for every information flows. endpoint. Review and assess pipeline cyber asset classification as critical or non -critical at least every 12 months. Business Environment Ensure that any change that adds control operations to a non -critical pipeline cyber asset results in the system being recognized as a critical pipeline cyber asset and enhanced security measures being applied. Governance Establish and distribute cybersecurity policies, plans, processes and supporting procedures commensurate with the current regulatory, risk, legal and operational environment. Review and assess all cybersecurity policies, Review and assess all cybersecurity policies, plans, processes, and supporting procedures plans, processes, and supporting procedures regularly, not to exceed 36 months, or when regularly, not to exceed 12 months, or when there is a significant organizational or there is a significant organizational change. technological change. Update as necessary. Update as necessary. Risk Management Strategy Develop an operational framework to ensure coordination, communication and accountability for information security on and between the control systems and enterprise networks. TSA Pipeline Security Guidelines Pipeline Cyber Asset Security Measures Table 3: Baseline and Enhanced Cyber Security Measures 24 Baseline Security Measures Enhanced Security Measures Identify Risk Assessment Establish a process to identify and evaluate vulnerabilities and compensating security controls. Ensure threat and vulnerability information received from information sharing forums and sources are made available to those responsible for assessing and determining the appropriate course of action. Protect Access Control Establish and enforce unique accounts for each individual user and administrator, establish security requirements for certain types of privileged accounts, and prohibit the sharing of these accounts. In instances where systems do not support unique user accounts, then implement appropriate compensating security controls (e.g., physical controls). Restrict user physical access to control systems and control networks through the use of appropriate controls. Employ more stringent identity and access management practices (e.g., authenticators, password - construct, access control). Ensure that user accounts are modified, deleted, or de -activated expeditiously for personnel who no longer require access or are no longer employed by the company. Establish and enforce access control policies for Monitor physical and remote user access to local and remote users. Procedures and controls critical pipeline cyber assets. should be in place for approving and enforcing policy for remote and third -party connections. Ensure appropriate segregation of duties is in place. In instances where this is not feasible, apply appropriate compensating security controls. Change all default passwords for new software, hardware, etc., upon installation. In instances where changing default passwords is not technically feasible (e.g., a control system with a hard-coded password), implement appropriate compensating security controls (e.g., administrative controls) . Employ mechanisms to support the management of accounts. TSA Pipeline Security Guidelines Pipeline Cyber Asset Security Measures Table 3: Baseline and Enhanced Cyber Security Measures 25 Baseline Security Measures Enhanced Security Measures Protect Awareness and Training Ensure that all persons requiring access to the organization's pipeline cyber assets receive cybersecurity awareness training. Provide role -based security training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of system compromise prior to obtaining access to the critical pipeline cyber assets. Establish and execute a cyber -threat awareness program for employees. This program should include practical exercises/testing. Data Security & Information Protection Establish and implement policies and procedures to ensure data protection measures are in place, including identifying critical data and establishing classification of different types of data, establishing specific handling procedures, and protections and disposal. Protective Technology Segregate and protect the pipeline cyber assets from enterprise networks and the internet using physical separation, firewalls and other protections. Regularly validate that technical controls comply with the organization 's cybersecurity policies, plans and procedures, and report results to senior management. Implement technical or procedural controls to restrict the use of pipeline cyber assets for only approved activities. Detect Anomalies and Events Implement processes to generate alerts and log cybersecurity events in response to anomalous activity. Review the logs and respond to alerts in a timely manner. Security Continuous Monitoring Monitor for unauthorized access or the introduction of malicious code or communications. Conduct cyber vulnerability assessments as described in your risk assessment process Utilize independent assessors to conduct pipeline cyber security assessments. TSA Pipeline Security Guidelines Pipeline Cyber Asset Security Measures Table 3: Baseline and Enhanced Cyber Security Measures 26 Baseline Security Measures Enhanced Security Measures Detect Detection Processes Establish technical or procedural controls for cyber intrusion monitoring and detection. Perform regular testing of intrusion and malware detection processes and procedures. Respond Response Planning Establish policies and procedures for cybersecurity incident handling, analysis and reporting, including assignment of the specific roles/tasks to individuals and teams. Conduct cybersecurity incident response exercises periodically. Establish and maintain a cyber -incident response capability. Establish and maintain a process that supports 24 hours a day cyber incident response. Communications Report significant cyber incidents to senior management; appropriate federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) entities; and applicable ISAC(s). Pipeline operators should follow the notification criteria in Appendix B Mitigation Ensure the organization's response plans and procedures include mitigation measures to help prevent further impacts. Recover Recovery Planning Establish a plan for the recovery and reconstitution of pipeline cyber assets within a timeframe to align with the organization's safety and business continuity objectives. Improvements Review the organization's cyber recovery plan annually. Update as necessary.
