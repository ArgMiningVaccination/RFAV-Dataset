A low dose CT case finding project is also being introduced in west London, to identify lung cancer earlier in patients at high risk, through access to a lung health check and a CT scan in convenient and accessible locations to encourage more people to come forward. The importance of early diagnosis is set out in the NHS Long Term Plan, published in January 2019, which outlines a significant and sustained investment in cancer services, and a renewed emphasis on further improving survival through the earlier detection of cancer, precision diagnosis and treatment, and better support to patients so that care is personalised to the needs of each individual. The Trust achieved a surplus for the year of \u00a364.6 million, a significant increase on the previous year. A large proportion of this surplus has been the receipt of additional Provider Sustainability Funds (PSF), of \u00a340.5 million, for overachieving the Control Total set by NHS Improvement at the beginning of the year. This was achieved by improved financial performance, both on increased revenue and controlling costs, compared with the original plan approved by the Board. All of the surplus has been earmarked towards improving infrastructure in the Trust over the coming years on estate, equipment and IT, ensuring the Trust can deliver upon its strategic objectives. Complementing this approach are the plans for a new treatment and research centre at The Royal Marsden in Sutton, the Oak Cancer Centre. A stateoftheart building, due to open in 2022, it will further improve the effectiveness and efficiency of patient care and increase the Trust's diagnosis and treatment capacity. The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity aims to raise \u00a370 million to build the new centre and has so far raised over \u00a350 million, including the Charity's largest single donation to date of \u00a325 million from Oak Foundation, which has generously supported The Royal Marsden in drug development and facilities for children and young people over the last decade. The Trust's deep appreciation and thanks are due to Mike Slade OBE, Appeal Board Chairman, and to all Appeal Board Members, for enabling the Trust to provide the very best environments for patients and staff, and to care for everyone who needs its specialist expertise.It is with great sadness that The Royal Marsden records that staff, patients and supporters lost a colleague, doctor and friend, following the sudden death of Professor Martin Gore CBE in January 2019. Martin was at the heart of The Royal Marsden's life and work in research, treatment, and the training of the next generation of oncologists. His contribution as Medical Director, as a Trustee of The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity, and as a clinician is unparalleled and his legacy will remain in all those he treated, counselled, advised and trained. Thank you to the Board and Council of Governors for their support and guidance in achieving and exceeding the financial plan and meeting the Trust's quality targets in 2018/19. A special thanks to all the staff of The Royal Marsden for continuing to provide the very best cancer care to its patients and for ensuring the Trust can continue to operate, with the Trust's academic partner, the ICR, as a globally significant centre of research for the benefit of patients worldwide. Cally Palmer CBE Chief Executive 23 May 2019 Charles Alexander Chairman 23 May 2019 1. Performance report Introduction The Royal Marsden opened in 1851 as the world's first hospital dedicated to cancer diagnosis, treatment, research and education. Today it operates as a specialist cancer hospital and National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre for Cancer, working closely with its principal academic partner, the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR). Together, The Royal Marsden and the ICR are ranked in the top five cancer centres in the world for the impact of their research. The Royal Marsden operates from two centres, in Chelsea and Sutton, and is the founder and host of RM Partners, the Cancer Alliance for west London, which includes St George's Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Imperial Healthcare NHS Trust, and other trust and clinical commissioning group (CCG) partners across north west and south west London.Overview of performance Chairman and Chief Executive joint statement Over the past year, The Royal Marsden has maintained its strong track record of performance on all quality, financial and service standards to ensure patients receive the very best quality of care and leadingedge treatment. The Royal Marsden was delighted to receive an overall Trust rating of 'outstanding' from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in September 2018 and a rating of 'outstanding' in the new 'well led' inspection. Inspectors commented on the exceptional quality of care provided to patients and their families, the collegiate culture at The Royal Marsden, and the contribution to patients here in England and worldwide, through research into better ways of diagnosing and treating cancer. Partnerships are vital in achieving a consistent and sustained level of excellence in patient treatment and care across the country. Over the course of this year, the Trust has been working with other trusts in north, east and west London on a new genomics partnership, collaborating with Great Ormond Street NHS Foundation Trust as the lead for one of NHS England's seven new laboratory hubs for genetic testing. Working with partners is also vital in the drive to provide cancer patients with an earlier and faster diagnosis to improve survival and quality of care. This year, RM Partners, the Cancer Alliance for west London, hosted by The Royal Marsden, has piloted two schemes to improve diagnosis for prostate and lung cancer, where earlier detection and precision diagnostics can make a significant difference to patient outcomes.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/194 5Summary of performance Please see below a list of highlights of the Trust's performance in 2018/19, set across its core strategic themes. Research and innovation Leadingedge research changing standards of care Royal Marsden clinicians presented the latest advances in cancer research and care at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's (ASCO) Annual Meeting in June 2018. A keynote lecture from Professor Johann de Bono, Regius Professor of Cancer Research and Consultant Medical Oncologist, revealed findings from the first clinical trial to show the benefits of immunotherapy in prostate cancer for some men with advanced, otherwise untreatable disease. Led by The Royal Marsden and the ICR, the international trial could lead to a subset of prostate cancers joining the list of diseases that can be treated with immunotherapy. An education session by Dr Susana Banerjee addressed the latest evidence on physician burnout. Its impact on physicians, patients and institutions has become increasingly apparent, and Dr Banerjee's session focused on solutions and strategies for tackling it, while incorporating her own perspective as an oncologist. In October 2018, clinicians also presented leading research at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress. Findings from one of the largest ever clinical trials for prostate cancer were presented and published in The Lancet . The study, led by The Royal Marsden, found that treating the prostate with radiotherapy alongside standard treatment led to an 11 per cent increase in survival for some men with advanced prostate cancer. Previously, it was unclear if there was any benefit of treating the prostate directly with radiotherapy, if the cancer had already spread. This research helps answer that question and has implications beyond prostate cancer.The findings from the Cancer Research UKfunded STAMPEDE trial could be practicechanging and suggest radiotherapy, alongside hormone therapy, should become the standard of care for a group of men with advanced prostate cancer, affecting thousands every year in the UK. A study of oesophageal and stomach cancer patients, led by The Royal Marsden, analysed data from four randomised trials carried out in the UK and Australasia. All four studies looked at commonly used firstline chemotherapy combinations in advanced oesophageal and stomach cancer. Artificial intelligence At The Royal Marsden, clinicians are exploring the latest advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technology to help diagnose cancer earlier and improve the quality of life for patients living with cancer. As part of a groundbreaking project, Dr Christina Messiou, Consultant Radiologist, is working with colleagues from Imperial College London to develop machine learning that will assist radiologists in reporting wholebody MRI scans in patients with myeloma. Machine learning is a type of AI in which computers are taught how to do things independently - for example, to identify scans that show evidence of cancer from healthy images. The new study with Imperial, MALIMAR (Machine Learning in Myeloma Response), funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), will train a computer algorithm to recognise the difference between a healthy scan and a patient with myeloma. Researchers will then examine the time it takes to process and report wholebody MRI scans normally, compared with a radiologist using machinelearning technology. The study also aims to find a way to quantify the amount of disease visible on wholebody MRIs. Leading breast cancer clinician recognised with international honour Consultant Medical Oncologist Professor Ian Smith won the 2018 William L. McGuire Memorial Lecture Award for his lifelong work in breast cancer oncology. The award is widely regarded as the highest international honour in this field.Looking forward: FiveYear Strategic Plan 2018/19-2023/24 The Royal Marsden's ambitions and objectives are set across the following core themes in its FiveYear Strategic Plan 2018/19-2023/24: -Research and innovation -Treatment and care -Modernising infrastructure -Financial sustainability and best value. The strategic objectives for the Trust have been identified from the four key themes highlighted above: 1. Research and innovation - the management and delivery of worldclass research and maintenance of top research performance while strengthening the Trust's working relationship with its academic partners 2. Treatment and care - the design and delivery of efficient, integrated pathways for cancer care which ensure quality is maintained and support the development of a successful surgical strategy 3. Modernising infrastructure - the planning and investment into the Trust's Sutton and Chelsea sites to ensure the Trust continues to deliver a sustainable service and is in a position to invest in IT, infrastructure and major equipment 4. Financial sustainability and best value - the successful delivery of the Trust's Private Care Strategy while maintaining fair NHS tariff pricing and controlling the Trust's temporary staffing expenditure.A copy of the Trust's FiveYear Strategic Plan can be accessed on the Trust website. As the Strategic Plan sets out, the Trust's primary aim is to deliver the best cancer treatment through worldleading research, operating a 'bench to bedside' approach with its academic partner, the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR). Cancer incidence is increasing with approximately 360,000 people diagnosed with cancer in the UK each year. The NHS Long Term Plan published in January 2019 set out specific priorities for improving survival through the earlier detection and diagnosis of cancer and through optimal treatment and care, ensuring the latest advances in treatment can be made available swiftly and uniformly throughout the country. As one of the largest providers of cancer care, The Royal Marsden will continue to support these national priorities, working collaboratively with partners across service and research, including the Trust's responsibility as host of RM Partners, the Cancer Alliance for west London.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/196 7The ability to target tumours with radiation beams in real time will be particularly effective for cancers that change position through breathing, bladder filling or bowel changes, and should reduce the sideeffects for the patient. For example, tumours in the prostate, lung, bladder and bowel would be targeted in real time - allowing the radiation beams to be adjusted with enhanced precision during the course of treatment. The patient received radiotherapy treatment on the MR Linac as part of the PRISM clinical trial. The installation of the MR Linac was made possible by a \u00a310 million grant from the Medical Research Council to the ICR, with additional support from The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity. Patient survey scores The Royal Marsden has been ranked as one of the best places in England to receive care, according to recent results published by the CQC. In their annual Adult Inpatient Survey, which looks at the experiences of adult patients in all NHS trusts, The Royal Marsden was ranked second in England for patient experience, rated 9.1 out of ten. The Trust received consistently high scores from almost 600 inpatients who completed the survey in September 2017. In the annual 'Patient Led Assessment of the Care Environment' (PLACE) inspections, the Trust also scored highly. The assessments, carried out in May 2018, tested and scored patient environments on six factors: -Cleanliness -Food -Privacy, dignity and wellbeing -Condition, appearance and maintenance -Dementia -Disability. The Trust has scored above the national average across all areas for both Chelsea and Sutton. It has improved significantly on its 'Disability' and 'Dementia' scores, and 'Food' continues to score highly.First robotic pelvic exenteration Surgeons at The Royal Marsden carried out what was believed to be the UK's first robotic total pelvic exenteration in autumn 2018. A patient with advanced rectal cancer underwent the radical procedure, which involves the removal of all of the organs from the pelvic area, and is now cancer free and doing well. The traditional approach would be to do an 'open' operation where a large incision would have been made from the chest down to the pubic bone in order to access and remove the organs and tumour. It would have taken substantially longer and is very invasive, meaning a longer recovery time and significant scarring for the patient. In contrast, by using robotic technology, a minimally invasive procedure could be performed instead. London North Genomics Laboratory Hub The Royal Marsden was chosen as the lead for one of NHS England's seven new laboratory hubs for genomic cancer testing. The Trust is collaborating with Great Ormond Street NHS Foundation Trust (GOSH) in the North, East and West London partnership (NEW London), with The Royal Marsden leading on cancer and GOSH on rare diseases. Genomic testing has revolutionised the study of cancer genomes. It promises better diagnoses for patients, and more effective treatments with fewer sideeffects. Using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 next generation sequencing machine means it is possible to simultaneously search for cancercausing variants in 200 genes from more than 200 patients in less than a week. Over the next two years, 11,000 tests will be moved over to the NovaSeq 6000, with 20,000 expected by year three. This represents a significant increase on the 8,000 patients that can currently be sequenced with the Trust's existing machines. This will transform the hospital's research and diagnostic capabilities, helping support the identification of new genetic mutations and drugs to target them.In December 2018, Professor Smith gave the lecture at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, the main international breast cancer conference of the year, which attracts more than 7,000 attendees. The conference organisers said that Professor Smith had changed the direction of breast cancer treatment in the UK and internationally, with colleagues describing his contributions as \"formidable\". The Royal Marsden's Breast Unit is the only one in the world to have had three recipients of both the McGuire and the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Brinker awards, with Professor Smith following in the footsteps of Professor Mitch Dowsett, Head of the Ralph Lauren Centre for Breast Cancer Research, and Professor Trevor Powles, now retired. Worldleading oncologist awarded an OBE Congratulations to Professor David Cunningham, Consultant Medical Oncologist and Head of the Gastrointestinal Unit, who was awarded an OBE in the 2019 New Year Honours for services to cancer treatment and research. One of the country's preeminent oncologists, Professor Cunningham's pioneering work has significantly changed our understanding of cancer and its treatment, and improved outcomes for patients across the globe. Meanwhile, in education and training, he has shaped the country's medical oncology training programme and inspired the next generation of clinicians. Professor Cunningham is internationally recognised as a leader of research into gastrointestinal cancer and lymphoma, and the development of novel molecular therapies. He has published extensively and his papers have set the foundation for many vital advances in treating gastrointestinal cancers. Award highlights our support for staff The Royal Marsden won the Best UK Employer of the Year award at the 2018 Nursing Times Workforce Summit Awards. The inaugural awards celebrated innovation and excellence across the spectrum of practice affecting nursing and healthcare staff. The award win centred on the Trust's success in reducing the vacancy rate in nursing roles and improving staff health and wellbeing. The judges commented on the focus on equality and diversity, and recognised that The Royal Marsden has a \"genuine commitment to support staff across the organisation\".Treatment and care Outstanding CQC result In the spring, The Royal Marsden welcomed a team of inspectors from the CQC, the independent regulator of health and social care services in England. As part of their visit to the Trust, the team evaluated Outpatients in Sutton and The Royal Marsden Community Services. They also assessed whether the Trust is 'well led' - a process that was introduced after the CQC recognised a strong link between the quality of the overall management of an NHS trust and that of its services. The Trust was delighted to announce that following these inspections, which built on a previous inspection in April 2016, the CQC rated The Royal Marsden as 'outstanding' overall, 'outstanding' for being well led, and both Chelsea and Sutton hospitals as 'outstanding'. They also recognised the improved quality of the Trust's Community Services, which were rated 'good'. The inspectors reached their decision by asking whether the services the Trust provides are safe, effective, caring, responsive and well led, marking the Trust against a rigorous set of criteria. The Royal Marsden scored 'good' for 'safe' 'well led', contributing to its overall 'outstanding' rating. First patient in the UK treated on the MR Linac In September 2018, The Royal Marsden and the ICR, London, delivered the first ever treatment in the UK and the third in the world using a Magnetic Resonance Linear Accelerator (MR Linac) machine. The MR Linac is the first technology in the world to simultaneously generate magnetic resonance images and deliver Xray radiation beams \u2014 allowing radiotherapy to be adjusted in real time and delivered more accurately and effectively than ever before.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/198 9Improving patient treatment with new radiotherapy machine The Royal Marsden's third Varian TrueBeam radiotherapy linear accelerator has been installed in Chelsea, ensuring even more patients can be treated using the latest technology. The TrueBeam delivers all forms of therapy (VMAT). Adding another unit means that the Trust can now treat up to 40 patients with various tumour types - including breast, lung, head and neck, prostate, gastrointestinal, and gynaecological cancers - every day. This doubling of capacity is thanks to an investment by NHS England to upgrade radiotherapy equipment across the country, and a \u00a31.5 million donation from The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity towards the installation and infrastructure of the machine. Financial sustainability and best value Introduction of biosimilars leads to cost savings for the NHS The Royal Marsden, working with RM Partners, has introduced a national cancer medicines optimisation programme, which is leading the introduction of biosimilars (copies of biological drugs) in the NHS. Biosimilars achieve the same result for patients but are up to 60 per cent cheaper compared with the originals. Within months of the introduction of the biosimilar rituximab, an important drug for blood cancers including lymphoma, 80 per cent of eligible patients across England had been switched to the biosimilar. If used nationwide, this biosimilar alone could save the NHS up to \u00a3100 million a year. The success of this project demonstrated the scale and impact of RM Partners to great effect. The Royal Marsden and RM Partners are working on the introduction of future biosimilars in oncology for NHS England. This work will provide many opportunities to accelerate the adoption of new treatment protocols for cancer patients across the whole country. The aim is to implement best practice across the whole system in order to reduce variation in outcomes and improve patient treatment and care across the UK.The Royal Marsden Private Care The Royal Marsden's private care service won four prizes at the 2018 LaingBuisson Awards, including the award for best private hospital for the second year running. Now in their 13th year, these prestigious awards recognise excellence in private healthcare and social care. The finalists were chosen by independent judges from more than 350 nominations, and The Royal Marsden was the only organisation to win four awards. These awards are a testament to The Royal Marsden's unique private care and NHS integrated model, which ensures it can offer all patients the highest standard of environment and facilities and continue to be worldwide leaders in the field of cancer care. Private care is paidfor treatment, opening up the hospital's expertise to patients from overseas and the UK who are able to fund their own care through insurance, sponsorship or selfpay. Being treated privately offers a patient more choice over their consultant, more flexibility in appointment times and dedicated private care facilities. At The Royal Marsden, patients have access to the very best research, clinicians, governance structures, facilities, treatment and care of an NHS hospital, combined with the hospitality, speed and service of a private centre. In addition, all of the profit generated by The Royal Marsden Private Care is reinvested into the NHS Foundation Trust. This money is used to fund new technology, equipment and research, and to continuously improve quality of care for both NHS and private patients alike, for example, the hospital's robotic surgery programme and the extension of the radiology service's opening hours, both of which benefit all patients regardless of the source of funding.Modernising infrastructure Lead donation for the Oak Cancer Centre The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity received its largest single donation to date, with Oak Foundation pledging \u00a325 million towards the construction of a new \u00a370 million facility that will speed up the development of breakthroughs in research into patient treatment and care. Previously referred to as the Clinical Care and Research Centre, the building - whose Project Consultant, Hamish McKenzie, was the Development Director for The Shard - will now be known as the Oak Cancer Centre. The \u00a325 million pledged takes the total amount donated by Oak over the 15 years it has supported The Royal Marsden to an exceptional \u00a343 million, which has made an enormous difference to the Trust's patients. Oak donated the lead gift of \u00a38 million for The Royal Marsden's Oak Centre for Children and Young People, which opened in 2011; it also supported the Oak Foundation Drug Development Unit and has funded the Oak Paediatric Drug Development Unit for 15 years. The Oak Cancer Centre will mean the Trust can treat more patients in new, ultramodern environments, expand its early diagnosis service and bring together more than 300 of its pioneering researchers. The major departments which will be in the building are Outpatients Departments and Haematology Outpatients, Medical Day Unit and Haematology Day Care Unit, Phlebotomy, Rapid Diagnostic Centre, Endoscopy Unit, Centre for Urgent Care, and a new Research Centre including collaboration areas and breakout spaces. The new centre will provide the space to see everyone who needs The Royal Marsden's specialised resources and expertise. The new building will vastly improve the patient facilities, providing not only the latest treatment in a bright, modern environment, but also supporting patients' wellbeing, dignity and privacy to make their experience as positive as it can be.Sutton site modernisation The Royal Marsden in Sutton has shared a site with the ICR since the early 1960s. Over the past four years, The Royal Marsden has been a supporting partner in the London Cancer Hub, an exciting project that will further enhance the worldleading facilities on the Sutton site for cancer research. The London Cancer Hub aims to create a vibrant community of scientists, doctors and innovative companies, supported by stateoftheart research and community amenities including a secondary school. The hub will attract innovative life science companies to work alongside the ICR and The Royal Marsden's worldleading scientists and clinicians, and is aiming to create 13,000 jobs and is projected to ultimately contribute \u00a31.2 billion to the UK economy each year. Also on the Sutton site will be the new Maggie's Centre, which had its 'topping out' ceremony in November 2018 - traditionally held when new structures reach their full height. Due to open in summer 2019, the new Maggie's Centre will allow The Royal Marsden to extend its support services to reach more patients in London, which sees more than 28,000 cancer diagnoses a year. The new centre, designed by Ab Rogers Design and built by building company Sir Robert McAlpine, marks another step forward in the redevelopment of The Royal Marsden's Sutton hospital. New private care facility in Cavendish Square The Royal Marsden's private care service is due to open a dedicated outpatient, diagnostic and treatment centre located on Cavendish Square in summer 2020. In the heart of London's independent healthcare district, the facility will have the clinical expertise and technology to provide a leading private care service and offer CQC outstanding standards of care. This is an exciting new development for Private Care, which has grown significantly over the last three years. The new centre will provide increased capacity for private patients across a number of tumour types, and will include consultation rooms, chemotherapy chairs, a minor procedures suite and imaging facilities. It will also allow further investment in the Trust's NHS services; this unique private care and NHS integrated model means all private care revenue goes back into the hospital, so all of the Trust's patients will benefit.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/1910 11The Board Assurance Framework The purpose of the Board Assurance Framework (BAF) is to present the Trust's risk assurance framework in the context of the Trust's strategic objectives, as set out in the FiveYear Strategic Plan 2018/19-2023/24. Detailed operational risks can be found in the Risk Register, which is presented to the Quality, Assurance and Risk Committee. This is also aligned with the FiveYear Strategic Plan. In 2018/19, the Board reviewed the BAF, as did the Trust's internal auditors KPMG. As a result of those reviews, the BAF was updated to ensure that it remains fitforpurpose and reflected the ongoing changes in the external environment, notably preparedness for a 'nodeal' Brexit. Furthermore, the Trust's risk scoring matrix was also updated and approved by the Board to better support the risk scoring methodology for the BAF. As at 31 March 2019, the following areas were identified and monitored in the Board Assurance Framework: Strategic objective Initial risk scoreCurrent risk score Delivery of IT strategy 20 20 Increase capacity constraints and meet cancer waiting times targets 25 16 Work collaboratively with the Royal Brompton Hospital 15 12 Ensure a sustainable paediatric model 16 12 RM Partners to rollout cancer care best practice 12 12 Ensure business continuity plans in the event of a 'nodeal' Brexit 12 12 Achieve key national infection control targets (E. coli and Clostridium difficile) 16 12 Support the national policy direction setting out much greater emphasis on system decisionmaking12 12 Achieve optimal scale and transformation through collaborations with partners 16 9 Develop a sustainable consultant medical model 16 9 Complete the development of the new diagnostic facility for private care (Cavendish Square)12 8 Maximise opportunities for Sutton via London Cancer Hub and Epsom and St Helier University Hospital NHS Trust8 8 Delivery of private care strategy 12 8 Successful delivery of Biomedical Research Centre grant 15 6 Statement of going concern After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the NHS Foundation Trust has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.Risk The continued delivery of a highquality service requires the identification, management and reduction of events or activities that could compromise the safety of patients, staff, visitors and any other persons. The Royal Marsden is proud that it is among the highest performing trusts in the 2018 Staff Survey for staff feeling they are treated fairly when they report an incident or near miss. This is very important in supporting a culture of reporting and learning from incidents.The systematic identification, analysis and control of risks is a key organisational responsibility. A culture of ownership and responsibility for risk management/patient safety is fostered throughout the organisation, and all managers and clinicians undertake risk management as one of their fundamental duties. This is achieved through an environment of openness and trust: where mistakes, adverse incidents and near misses are identified quickly and dealt with in a positive and responsive way. The submission of timely and accurate information to assess risk is promoted throughout the organisation. The Trust supports a culture of fairness, openness and learning by treating staff fairly so they are not deterred from reporting incidents out of fear of blame. Risk management aims to achieve the optimum balance between quality of care, treatment and rehabilitation of patients, and the provision of services which are safe by optimising use of resources and identifying prioritised risk control action plans. Risk reduction is achieved through a continuous cycle of the identification, assessment, control, monitoring and review of risk, via our Corporate Risk Register and the Board Assurance Framework.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/1912 13therefore the Board continues to closely monitor this risk via the Trust Risk Register and Board Assurance Framework. The Audit and Finance Committee receives regular reports on cybersecurity and oversees the implementation of the Trust's action plan to achieve Cyber Essentials Plus accreditation, which was developed in accordance with the National CyberSecurity Centre guidance. Main events affecting the Trust For eight years, The Royal Marsden has provided community services for the London Borough of Sutton. The Trust is proud of the standards delivered by this service and the improvements in quality and performance staff have achieved, as evidenced by patient feedback and national awards, in both health visiting and service innovation. The Trust has met almost 100 per cent of its key performance indicators, compared with 62 per cent since The Royal Marsden was selected to lead and manage community services in 2011. However, the Trust and its partners have agreed that community services in Sutton should be hosted by a partner in the Sutton Health and Care Alliance (SHC Alliance) rather than a provider of specialist cancer care, to ensure there is the right expertise and focus on community services going forward. On 1 April 2019, The Royal Marsden Community Services transferred to the management of the SHC Alliance. Brexit The Trust's preparation for the planned EU Exit in March 2019 was led by the Chief Pharmacist Jatinder Harchowal, Head of EU Exit at The Royal Marsden, and Chief Nurse Eamonn Sullivan, Senior Responsible Owner (SRO) for EU Exit, in close liaison with individual risk leads across the Trust. As part of the preparation, the Trust held an EU Exit table top exercise with representatives from across the Trust to discuss scenarios around medicine and equipment supply, staffing and clinical research. An EU Exit Committee was set up and met fortnightly to ensure communication around any issues were highlighted and plans were in place to manage any risk associated with the supply of medicines, vaccines, radioisotopes and medical products used in clinical trials.The Trust monitored changes to its European staffing profile and encouraged staff to apply for the settlement scheme. The Royal Marsden agreed to pay a contribution for staff who were applying for settled status or presettled status, and dropin sessions in HR were held with visa specialists so staff can be supported with the application. An email inbox was set up to collate staff queries and concerns. The Head and SRO of EU Exit were the main points of contact with NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care, and the Head of EU Exit was a member of the London Region Pharmacy and Medicines EU Exit Panel. Key performance indicators The Royal Marsden has a performance monitoring framework which ensures that performance is regularly reviewed both at organisational and department level. At the most senior level, the Board of Directors and Council of Governors receive the quarterly scorecard which includes Red/Amber/ Greenrated key performance indicators. This report provides assurance to the Board of Directors regarding Trust performance and of any mitigating actions required to remedy underperformance. Red, Amber and Green thresholds are set based on national standards and local strategic objectives, and are signedoff by the departmental directors, the Chief Operating Officer and the Director of Performance and Information. In addition, Clinical Business Units (CBUs) review their scorecards on a monthly basis. These scorecards are more detailed than the board scorecard and have a more operational function. They are an essential tool in maintaining the strong performance of the Trust, and with targets set at a unit level, CBUs are able to rapidly identify issues and respond appropriately. Please see page 14 for the balanced scorecard template.Performance analysis Financial summary for the year ended 31 March 2019 The Royal Marsden has been an NHS Foundation Trust for 15 years and, in a tough financial environment, over the past year has achieved a record financial performance, predominantly due to accessing incentive Provider Sustainability Funding (PSF) of \u00a337.8 million, as well as the PSF in the original plan of \u00a32.6 million; a total of \u00a340.5 million. The financial accounts for the year 2018/19 therefore show the Trust generated a surplus of \u00a364.6 million. The PSF funds have been ringfenced for the capital programme into future years and are being used for the IT Strategy, including the electronic patient record (EPR) replacement, a project estimated to cost over \u00a340 million in capital. The Trust continues to maintain a strong balance sheet and cash position. At 31 March 2019 the Trust held cash deposits of \u00a378.2 million; an increase of \u00a330.9 million from the previous year. The Trust generated \u00a348.8 million from operational activities. The Trust invested \u00a317.8 million in capital expenditure and made a Public Dividend Capital dividend to the Department of Health of \u00a33.3 million, which represented an actual dividend rate of 3.5 per cent. The Trust completed a full valuation of the asset base in 2016/17, as per the Trust's accounting policy, which is to carry out a full inspection valuation every five years. The valuation was carried out on a Modern Equivalent Asset (MEA) basis which considers the cost of reproviding an equivalent service on an alternative site with modern building design, as opposed to the current market value of the site. In following the Trust's accounting policy, an interim valuation will be completed in the third year. Consequently, for 2018/19, the Trust has requested the valuation firm review the materiality of the market conditions since the last full valuation which has resulted in no change to the overall valuation of the asset base.Efficiency In the continued challenging economic environment, the Trust has delivered the total efficiency programme for 2018/19. This programme of efficiency has delivered improvements in order to meet NHS tariff reductions, to support the local health economy and to deliver the Trust's surplus for the year. Financing and investment Despite the financial challenges, the Trust has continued to invest in estate and infrastructure, spending \u00a317.8 million on buildings, equipment and IT. There was \u00a35.2 million funded through charitable donations and \u00a31.7 million from Public Dividend Capital for a new linear accelerator. The remainder of the capital programme was funded through operating surpluses, retained depreciation and free cash. Governance The framework from the Trust's regulators, NHS Improvement, rates trusts from 1 (lowest risk) to 4 (highest risk). The Royal Marsden has been rated as a 1 all year and is therefore meeting its governance arrangements covering compliance with the terms of its licence and meeting NHS standards and targets for performance.

Environmental sustainability, social, community, antibribery and human rights issues are taken into account when developing and/or reviewing Trust policies. As standard procedure, the Trust requires all authors of policies to declare any impact they may have on equality and confidentiality requirements.Sustainability The Royal Marsden operates as a financially and socially responsible organisation. It recognises the need to minimise its impact on the environment in order to deliver the highest quality healthcare in the communities it serves, now and in the future. The Trust takes its responsibility as a major employer and consumer of energy and resources seriously, and is committed to helping reduce the adverse effects of its operations on the wider environment. The Trust has a Sustainable Development Management Plan (SDMP), which it continues to implement and update. This ensures that it fulfils the commitment to conducting all aspects of its activities - such as compliance with environmental legislation, carbon and energy management, waste management, water management, and in the design and build of any new environment - with due consideration to sustainability. The Trust's commitment to sustainable development has resulted in significant improvement in energy efficiency and utilities cost savings. Our reporting is based on our current SDMP approved in 2012.6.

The electricity consumption has increased by 2.9 per cent and gas consumption has decreased by seven per cent, compared with the previous year. Heatwaves during the summer and consequently the increased need for using air conditioning cooling systems, and increased operational hours, are believed to be the main contributors to the increase of electricity use. Gas consumption has decreased due to a milder winter, improved CHP and boiler operational efficiencies. Energy consumption and costs 0102030405060Gas 2,296,537 In terms of energy costs, in 2018/19 the Trust spent \u00a32.3 million on energy (electricity and gas); this is up 23 per cent on the previous year's spend. The site energy consumption overall has reduced, but a significant increase in energy unit costs stopped the downward trend for reducing costs. The Trust also generated an income of \u00a3418,000 for exporting electricity from the CHP system, solar panels and STOR (Short Term Operating Reserve) scheme income and recharging for energy used by Vodafone, Sphere and Erigal. The Trust also realised some benefits from additional energy saving measures. In terms of the Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) Energy Efficiency Scheme costs, the Trust spent \u00a3142,575 for the energy carbon emissions, which this is a reduction of nine per cent compared to the previous year. 2017/18 2018/19 CRC costs: \u00a3157,185 \u00a3142,575Carbon and energy management The chart below shows the Trust's carbon reduction progress against its target Carbon Management Plan and calculated business as usual (BAU) trend. The Trust's carbon footprint reduced by 2,355 tonnes of carbon dioxide (TCO2) in the forecast for 2018/19 over the previous year, and saw a reduction of 8,693 TCO2 over predicted BAU trend. The ambitious carbon reduction target was set to reflect a national NHS target to achieve a 34 per cent reduction against its 2010/11 consumption figures by 2020/21. This target has been exceeded by improving the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system and building services plant efficiencies, and implementing energysaving measures. The Trust is currently at 38 per cent below its 2010/11 carbon emissions. Carbon progress against target Predicted business as usual emissions (tC O2) Target emissions (tCO2) Actual emissionsTonnes CO2 Annual Report and Accounts 2018/1922 23Water Our water consumption during 2018/19 has increased by 6,738m3 (eight per cent) over the previous year. The overall water cost has reduced by two per cent (\u00a33,630). The cost reduction is due to improved unit cost rate. Water consumption and The Trust is a major consumer of water and has been actively trying to reduce the volume of water used; balancing water efficiency against the need to improve infection control via increased hand washing and increased flushing in areas of low consumption, and to guard against the risks of legionella contamination and other potentially harmful bacteria. The Trust experienced two major water leaks at the Chelsea and Sutton sites, which resulted in increased water usage and cost.Other sustainability achievements -The Trust has been carrying out energy reduction schemes for many years in order to meet its carbon reduction plan. During 2018/19, additional energy and costsaving schemes have been funded and instigated by the Trust, including: LED energysaving lighting schemes at both Chelsea and Sutton hospitals -Improved efficiency and cost saving of the CHP plant over the last year -Upgrades to ventilation systems in pharmacy aseptic and outpatients at the Oak Centre for Children and Young People , and introduction of energy efficient fans and motors which use 30 per cent less electricity than the conventional systems -Connection of Bud Flanagan Ambulatory Care heating system to district heating system and utilisation of available CHP heat in the plant rooms instead of using electric heat pumps -Implemented STOR at both sites. The scheme uses our standby generators to generate electricity during specific hours of the year without any interruption to electrical services. The Trust will generate significant revenue for participating in this scheme -Initiated a Demand Site Response (DSR) scheme which will facilitate an operation strategy to control air conditioning systems and the ventilation system in a more cost effective way -Submitted a business case for a CHP scheme at the Chelsea site -Submitted an application for NHS Improvement LED Energy Efficiency Fund -Replaced water tanks, improved water systems and repaired leaks -Replaced a number of lifeexpired air conditioning units with superefficient R32 systems -Implemented a cooling and ventilation systems strategy in areas such as pharmacy stores. This is to avoid the need to install air conditioning units -Replaced lifeexpired Building Energy Management System (BEMS) controlled panels. The new controls are providing a better level of system control, efficiency and metering -Prepared a proposal for the sites' energy and monitoring system. By reducing energy consumption, current and past schemes have produced a substantial monetary saving on energy costs, which has been and will be reinvested in patient care. Renewable energy The Trust has installed solar PV panels to some of its new buildings, which generate clean electricity to the annual value of 53,341 kWh; equivalent to \u00a315,000 of Feed In Tariff (FIT) income.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/1924 25Equality and diversity At The Royal Marsden, equality, diversity, inclusion and human rights are central to the way it provides healthcare services to its patients and supports its staff. The Royal Marsden wants to be known as an organisation that promotes equality, values and celebrates diversity, and has created an inclusive environment for receiving care and for being employed. The Royal Marsden has an equalities strategy that sets out its ambitions and approach to the equalities agenda. This can be viewed on the Trust's website: www.royalmarsden.nhs.uk/ aboutroyalmarsden/equalityanddiversity/ equalityobjectives. This approach has been further developed in the workforce strategy, Aspiring to Excellence, detailing the Trust's commitment to ensuring an open, transparent and inclusive environment where feedback is encouraged, staff feel engaged and where the Trust learns from its mistakes and celebrates success. In March 2019, the Trust published its gender pay gap findings, in line with legislative requirements. The median gender pay gap is 8.9 per cent. Further information can be found on the Trust's website: www. royalmarsden.nhs.uk/aboutroyalmarsden/ equalityanddiversity/genderpaygapreporting. Strategic responsibility for driving the equality, diversity and inclusion agenda across The Royal Marsden rests with the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Steering Group, along with setting annual priorities and monitoring equality performance. Membership of the Steering Group is multidisciplinary across different levels and includes Executive Board members, Patient Governors and members of the Patient and Carer Advisory Group.In January 2019, the annual Equality Report was approved by the Steering Group. The main purpose of this report is to provide assurance that the Trust is compliant with its responsibilities under the Equality Act 2010 and, in particular, the public sector equality duty. The report highlights the progress made towards achieving the 2018/19 equality objectives and key priorities for 2019/20. The Equality Report is published on the equality and diversity pages of the Trust's website, along with a comprehensive set of equality information for services and employment. The Royal Marsden has an equality and diversity policy which sets out the framework through which it delivers its services and provides employment. All staff are required to attend mandatory equality and diversity training, which is refreshed every three years. Bespoke training is also developed, for example, cultural awareness training for frontline staff, focusing on the needs of patients from the Middle East. The organisation has seen an increase in the diversity of its workforce, with a six per cent increase in staff from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds since 2015, with this staff group now accounting for 32 per cent of staff. Three staff equality networks are provided. These are the forum for BAME staff, the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transsexual + (LGBT+) network, and a network for staff with disabilities and health conditions, which was launched in 2018. All of these networks are run jointly with the ICR. The BAME staff forum hosted a number of events to celebrate Black History Month, including a lunchtime question and answer session with Yvonne Coghill OBE, Director of the Workforce Race Equality Standard. The forum has increased its membership to over 100 members since it launched in 2015.Waste At The Royal Marsden, waste is stored, transported and disposed of in accordance with waste legislation, regulations and codes of practice, including 'Health Technical Memorandum 0701: Safe Management of Healthcare Waste' (HTM 0701). By doing this, staff, patients and members of the public are kept safe. The chart below shows the category and volume of waste, in tonnes, from the Chelsea and Sutton sites combined for the financial year 2018/19. None of the waste goes to landfill. Below are the various routes the Trust's waste takes: -Recyclables, including glass - recycled into new produce -Confidential documents - securely destroyed and recycled -Food - anaerobic digestion -General (domestic) - energy from waste -Clinical - incinerated in line with legislation -Bulky/furniture - reused or deconstructed for parts. Travel and transport The Trust reviews its car parking policy annually to ensure that the car parking facilities are managed as efficiently and as fairly as possible, and has been proactive in developing alternative means of travelling to site. Charging facilities for two electric vehicles have been installed at the Trust's Sutton site. Following consultation with staff and patients on the uptake of electric vehicles, the Trust will be installing two more during 2019/20. The Trust has a longstanding and well developed travel plan which is reviewed annually. It is informed by latest good practice and guidance, travel plan surveys and the input of relevant local agencies, such as the London Borough of Sutton's Travel Awareness Coordinator. The travel plan includes initiatives such as enhancements to the staff 'intersite' and 'shuttle bus' services; the 'Walk Bike' sessions; installation of 'real London local bus timetables; interestfree bike loans; and increased use of videoconferencing to minimise travel. We also encourage staff when travelling as a result of business to take public transport wherever possible. The Trust has achieved the Mayor of London's third (and final) stage of the London NHS Cycling Strategy. Future direction The Trust will continue to explore, and include, measures and investment to reduce the energy and utilities that it uses, and therefore reduce carbon emissions, by managing its estate and activities so as to reduce our impact on the environment.

The policy makes reference to the fact that under the Bribery Act 2010 it is an offence for an employee to accept any inducement or reward for doing, or refraining from doing, anything in his/her official capacity or corruptly showing favour or disfavour in the handling of contracts. The same policy also outlines the Trust's arrangements for dealing with breaches of its provisions, including the possibility of taking legal action to investigate and prosecute in cases where fraud, bribery and corruption has been established. In relation to this, the Trust also has an AntiFraud, Bribery and Corruption Policy and Procedure. This policy is also monitored by the Audit and Finance Committee, which also receives regular reports on this issue, including an annual report from the local antifraud specialist. No major concerns or issues relating to bribery or fraud were identified in 2018/19.

Those attending meetings of the Nominations Committee may vary according to the business of the meeting, e.g. a NonExecutive Director would not be present when his/her reappointment is under review.In accordance with its terms of reference, the Nominations Committee manages the process of identification and reappointment of NonExecutive Directors (NEDs), determines and advises on NED levels of remuneration and time commitment, and ensures appropriate and timely succession planning for NEDs. The Nominations Committee will also function on the reappointment requests of NEDs by reviewing their performance and contribution to the Board of Directors. In cases of NED appointment or reappointment, the Nominations Committee submits its recommendation to the Council of Governors for approval. To assist the Committee with its search and selection of NED candidates, the Committee appoints external search consultants. A term of office for NEDs is three years unless the director resigns or is removed by the Council of Governors during the term. The removal of a NED requires the approval of threequarters of members of the Council of Governors. In accordance with Corporate Governance Standards, details for disqualification from holding office of a director can be found in the Trust's Constitution. Directors and governors are also required to declare their interests on an annual basis, as well as confirm that they meet the 'fit and proper person's condition', as set out in Regulation 5 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.Committees of the Board The Audit and Finance Committee The Audit and Finance Committee is a formally constituted committee of the Board and is chaired by NonExecutive Director Ian Farmer. The membership of the Committee consists of four NonExecutive Directors, representatives from the Trust's internal auditors and counterfraud specialists KPMG LLP and external auditors Deloitte LLP, as well as the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Nurse. Senior management are invited to attend meetings when necessary. The Audit and Finance Committee met four times in the year in order to discharge its responsibilities. An extraordinary Finance Committee was also held. A key purpose of this Committee is to assure itself that relevant risks, particularly financial risks, are appropriately identified and managed through a robust system of internal control established within the Trust. At each meeting, the Committee reviews the financial position of the Trust, the efficiency programme, the capital plan, and the working capital and cash position, as well as key assumptions within those. Areas of risk and significant financial impact are also presented to the Committee for review, including the annual planning process and the financial plan for recommendation for Board approval. Other topics reviewed inyear include cybersecurity, IT strategy update, and model hospital update. During the year the Committee received papers from the Trust's internal auditors KPMG LLP reporting on the findings of the 2018/19 Internal Audit Plan. This Plan is prepared with Trust senior management and is approved by the Audit and Finance Committee. The reports in 2018/19 covered a number of areas such as cybersecurity, discharge planning, board assurance framework, social media, RM Partners, workforce data quality and financial controls. Recommendations are fed back to management, then monitored, and progress is reported in future Audit and Finance Committee meetings. The Head of Internal Audit Opinion confirmed that significant assurance can be given with minor improvements on the overall adequacy and effectiveness of the Foundation Trust's framework of governance, risk management and control.The Trust's external auditors, Deloitte LLP, presented their findings from external audits of the Trust's Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Report. The external audit process includes an ongoing assessment of internal and external factors affecting the Trust, including reviewing the Trust performance compared with other NHS trusts. The Trust did not receive a qualification on the Quality Report in 2018/19. In addition, Deloitte LLP also provides regular progress reports on sector developments to the Audit and Finance Committee. The Trust conducted a rigorous tender process in 2014 regarding the appointment of the Trust's external auditors. Three bids were submitted in the tender process, all of which were evaluated and scored by relevant members of staff and governors of the Trust. A detailed outline of the process was presented by the Chair of the Audit and Finance Committee to the Council of Governors with a recommendation for appointment. At their meeting on 10 December 2014, the Council of Governors approved the reappointment of external auditors Deloitte LLP, commencing from the 2015/16 financial year for a threeyear term, with an option to extend for a further two years. At the Council of Governors meeting held on 4 July 2018, the Council of Governors agreed to reappoint the external auditors Deloitte LLP for a further twoyear period. The value of external audit services, including the Quality Report, in 2018/19 is \u00a393,840 with no nonaudit services being provided. The Quality, Assurance and Risk Committee The Quality, Assurance and Risk Committee (QAR) chaired by Ms Heather Lawrence OBE, NonExecutive Director, supports the Trust Board in developing an integrated approach to governance by ensuring robust systems are in place to monitor achievements against objectives. The Committee focuses on all nonfinancial risks such as patient safety, emergency planning, compliance with national and international regulation, health and safety, research and clinical integrated governance. Each quarter the members of the QAR meet staff from various divisions to gain a better understanding of key issues and priorities in that particular field.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/1934 35Attendance at meetings of the Board of Directors and its committees in 2018/19 Name Role Meetings attended (at 31 March 2019)Term of officeEnd of current term Board of Directors Charles Alexander Chairman 8 / 8 1st 30 November 2019 Mark Aedy NonExecutive Director/Senior Independent Director 6 / 8 1st 17 April 2019 Professor Martin Elliott NonExecutive Director 8 / 8 1st 31 October 2020 Ian Farmer NonExecutive Director 8 / 8 2nd 31 March 2020 Heather Lawrence OBE NonExecutive Director 8 / 8 1st 30 June 2020 Christopher Clark NonExecutive Director 5 / 5 1st 31 August 2021 William Jackson NonExecutive Director 4 / 5 1st 31 August 2021 Professor Paul Workman NonExecutive Director 3 / 8 2nd 30 June 2020 Professor Dame Janet Husband NonExecutive Director (served until May 2018) 0 / 1 Cally Palmer CBE Chief Executive 8 / 8 Dr Liz Bishop Chief Operating Officer/Deputy Chief Executive (left the Trust in October 2018)5 / 5 Karl Munslow Ong Chief Operating Officer (joined the Trust in November 2018) 3 / 3 Mr Eamonn Sullivan Chief Nurse 8 / 8 Dr Nicholas van As Medical Director 7 / 8 Marcus Thorman Chief Financial Officer 8 / 8 Audit and Finance Committee Ian Farmer Chairman of Committee/NonExecutive Director 5 / 5 Mark Aedy NonExecutive Director 5 / 5 Heather Lawrence OBE NonExecutive Director 5 / 5 Christopher Clark NonExecutive Director (appointed in September 2018) 2 / 3 Professor Dame Janet Husband NonExecutive Director (term ended in May 2018) 1 / 2 Remuneration Committee Charles Alexander Chairman of the Trust 2 / 2 Ian Farmer NonExecutive Director 2 /2 Mark Aedy NonExecutive Director/Senior Independent Director 2 / 2 Cally Palmer CBE Chief Executive 2 / 2 Nominations Committee Charles Alexander Chairman of the Trust 1 /1 Quality, Assurance and Risk Committee Heather Lawrence OBE Chairman of Committee / NonExecutive Director 4 / 4 Eamonn Sullivan Chief Nurse 4 / 4 Nicholas van As Medical Director 4 / 4 Charles Alexander Chairman of the Trust 4 / 4 Cally Palmer CBE Chief Executive 3 / 4 Karl Munslow Ong Chief Operating Officer (joined the Trust in November 2018) 2 / 2 Liz Bishop Chief Operating Officer/Deputy Chief Executive (left the Trust in October 2018)2 / 2 Marcus Thorman Chief Financial Officer 3 / 4 Professor Martin Elliott NonExecutive Director 3 / 4 Council of Governors* Cally Palmer CBE Chief Executive 6 / 6 Marcus Thorman Chief Financial Officer 6 / 6 Eamonn Sullivan Chief Nurse 6 / 6 Nicholas van As Medical Director 3 / 6 Liz Bishop Chief Operating Officer/Deputy Chief Executive (left the Trust October 2018)3 / 4 Karl Munslow Ong Chief Operating Officer (joined the Trust November 2018) 2 / 2 *NonExecutive Directors are invited to attend the Council of Governors on an optional basis.Performance evaluation of the Trust Board of Directors, its Committees and Directors The Trust Board is satisfied that it has the sufficient skills, knowledge and experience to fulfil its statutory duties and meet the business needs of the Trust. To assure itself of this, the Trust Board evaluates its performance annually, based on the findings and action plan resulting from its selfassessment process which was carried out in line with the Well Led Framework issued by the healthcare regulator. The assessment included a review of the Board's effectiveness of its systems of internal controls. The Board used a number rating methodology to undertake the selfassessment review of its effectiveness. The results were presented to the Board in June 2018, and included an action plan to improve governance across the Trust. At the Board away day in October 2018, the Board agreed to commission an external review of risk in accordance with the Well Led Framework. The Trust Board Committees, the Audit and Finance Committee and the Quality, Assurance and Risk Committee also undertook a similar evaluation exercise, in addition to reviewing their terms of reference, to ensure these remain fit for purpose. The Board's Well Led evaluation of their performance relates to their evaluation of the Trust's overall performance. This is achieved in a number of ways, such as a regular review of the Trust's KPIs, Quality Report, Financial Performance Report, Risk Register and Board Assurance Framework.The Nominations Committee is responsible for reviewing the balance of the Board in terms of its skills, knowledge and experience. This discussion formed the basis of the selection process in finding two new NEDs to join the Trust's Board of Directors in 2018/19. The Chairman's appraisal was completed in December 2018 and was led by the Senior Independent Director, who consulted with the NEDs, Executive Directors and the Governors. The Senior Independent Director presented the results of the Chairman's appraisal in a private meeting to the Council of Governors. In cases of NED reappointment requests, the Nominations Committee reviews the performance of the NED prior to confirming its recommendation to the Council of Governors. The Chairman is also available to discuss with the NEDs Board effectiveness and any training and development that may be required on an individual and/or collective basis. The Trust's NEDs regularly attend the Council of Governors Meeting and gain an understanding of the views of Governors and members of the Trust. A membership report is also presented at these meetings as well as to the Board of Directors. The Chief Executive undertakes an annual appraisal of each Executive Director to ensure objectives are achieved and a high standard of performance and effectiveness is maintained.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/1936 37Invoice Payment Performance The Trust adopts a Better Payment Practice Code where it aims to pay 95 per cent of invoices within the agreed terms, unless there is a dispute. In 2018/19 there were 74,517 (2017/18: 79,618) invoices due to be paid within a 30day period, of which 63,292 (2017/18: 69,191) were paid within target. Of those that weren't paid within target, interest of \u00a312.42 (2017/18: \u00a34.87) was paid during the year. 2018/19 2017/18 Total number of cases Total value of Total bills paid within target 1,583 13,404 Percentage of bills paid within target62 81 61 76 NonNHS payables Total bills paid in the year 72,098 239,055 Total bills paid within target 67,608 178,237 Percentage of bills paid within target86 83 88 84 Statement as to disclosures to auditors As far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Trust's auditors are unaware. Each Director has taken all the steps a director ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information, and to establish that the auditors are aware of such information. Auditors The Trust's appointed external auditors are Deloitte LLP. The auditors provide audit services comprising carrying out the statutory audit of the Trust's Annual Accounts and the use of resources work, as mandated by Monitor and the National Audit Office, and a review of the Quality Report. The cost of this service in 2018/19 was \u00a393,840 (and in 2017/18 was \u00a391,560). Cost allocation and charging requirements The Trust has complied with the cost allocation and charging requirement set out in HM Treasury and Office of Public Sector Information Guidance. Accounting for pension and other retirement benefits The accounting policies for pensions and other retirement benefits are set out in note 21 to the Annual Accounts.Income disclosures The Trust's principal activity is the provision of healthcare services to patients. The income from the provision of goods and services for the purposes of the health service in England is greater than its income from the provision of goods and services for any other purposes. The Trust has met this requirement, with 68 per cent of its income deriving from the NHS. In reaching this assessment the Trust has considered whether an exchange of goods and services has occurred, and whether income relates to activities required under the Health and Social Care Act 2012. In 2018/19, the overall income was \u00a3468.6 million (\u00a3428.3 million in 2017/18). This demonstrated strong growth in operating income from both Commissioner Requested Services, as well as in Private Care. In addition, there was a large increase in Provider Sustainability Fund (PSF) income of \u00a321.7 million, as well as growth in income from commercial trials and research income from the NIHR. The Trust exceeded its control total in 2018/19, hence the additional incentive PSF. The Trust receives the majority of its patient care income from NHS England and Clinical Commissioning Groups. Patient referrals are centred on the Trust's sites in Chelsea, Sutton and Kingston, but extend from this local base to cover all of England and beyond, particularly for referrals for rare cancers. NHS patient income is supplemented by income to provide infrastructure and support for research and development activity and from private patient income. The margin delivered on our private patient income remains a vital source of support for NHS services to patients. The Trust's overall operating expenditure was \u00a3401.1 million (\u00a3389.4 million in 2017/18), an increase of \u00a311.7 million. The net increase is due to staff and drugs costs increasing for inflation, and additional activity. The Trust hosts RM Partners, the Cancer Alliance for west London. The income and expenditure for this is included within the Trust's accounts and equates to \u00a310.6 million.Business review The Trust's activities are reviewed in: -Chairman and Chief Executive joint statement on page 2 -Financial summary on page 12. In addition to this, other information relevant to the Trust's activities is set out in the other sections of this document. Quality Governance is addressed in the Quality Report and Annual Governance Statement of this document. Political and charitable donations The Royal Marsden has not made any political or charitable donations this year or in previous years. Public sector payment policy The Trust aims to pay its nonNHS trade creditors in accordance with the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) prompt payment code and government accounting rules. The target is to pay nonNHS trade creditors within 30 days of receipt of goods or a valid invoice (whichever is the later), unless other payment terms have been agreed with the supplier. The Trust also aims to pay local community suppliers within ten days.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/1938 39Components of remuneration for Executive Directors The table that follows describes the component elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors. Component Applicable Description Annual salary (inclusive of London weighting and oncall)Executive Directors (except Medical Director whose base salary will be determined by NHS consultant terms and conditions)Agreed on appointment and reviewed in line with pay principles. NHS Pension Executive Directors Contributions are paid by the employee and the employer in accordance with the national scheme. Individuals have the right to opt out of the NHS Pension scheme.

Medical oncall Medical Director This is part of national terms and conditions for consultants. The Trust's FiveYear Strategic Plan and annual business planning process inform the objectives of the Executive Directors. Their performance is monitored throughout the year and assessed formally through an annual appraisal. No performancerelated pay or bonuses or other incentive payments are currently paid to Executive Directors separate to the annual salary. No benefits in kind or noncash elements of remuneration were made during the financial year. There was no local consultation with affected employees on pay for Executive Directors or the Leadership Team. However, the Trust pay principles take account of the Will Hutton Fair Pay Review and the senior salaries review body report on pay, which involved wide consultation. Executive Directors notice periods and payments for loss of office (Information subject to audit) Executive Directors are appointed on permanent contracts subject to notice of 12 weeks, except for the Chief Executive who is on six months' notice. All directors benefit from NHS terms and conditions relating to any severance payments for reasons of redundancy (Schedule 16 of Agenda for Change). There is no contractual entitlement to a severance payment in any other circumstances. No compensation for early termination was paid during the financial year. No early terminations are expected and no provisions are required accordingly. NonExecutive Directors remuneration Remuneration and allowances for the Chairman and NonExecutive Directors are determined by the Trust's Nomination Committee, which is made up of governors. The payments are comparable to those made by other Foundation Trusts. There was no change to remuneration arrangements in 2018/19. The Chairman and NonExecutive Directors receive no benefits or entitlements other than fees, and are not entitled to any termination payments. The Trust does not make any contribution to the pensions arrangements of NonExecutive Directors. Details of their remuneration and expenses are set out further in this section.Remuneration report The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust's remuneration report describes how the Trust applies the principles of good corporate governance in relation to Directors' remuneration. The remuneration report comprises: -Annual statement on remuneration -Very senior managers' pay principles -Annual report on remuneration. Annual statement on remuneration In the financial year 2018/19, the Remuneration Committee considered the pay award for Executive Directors and the Leadership Team. In reaching its decision the Committee took account of the national guidance available at the time. The Committee approved a two per cent increase effective from 1 October, in line with other NHS pay awards. The Committee also reviewed the remuneration arrangements of specific Executive Director and Leadership Team posts that were due a threeyear review in line with the pay principles for very senior managers. The Committee received a report on the latest developments with pay and pensions in the NHS. There were changes at Executive Director level with Dr Liz Bishop, Chief Operating Officer/ Deputy Chief Executive, leaving the Trust to take up the post of Chief Executive at The Clatterbridge Cancer Centre NHS Foundation Trust. Karl Munslow Ong joined the Trust as Chief Operating Officer in November 2018. The Leadership Team expanded to include a new Chief Information Officer role to lead implementation of the Trust's Digital Transformation Strategy.The Remuneration Committee considered the governance arrangements for The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity in relation to pay and terms and conditions of employment. Previously, staff working for the Charity were directly employed by the Trust, but in September 2018, the employment contracts of these staff transferred to the Charity under TUPE (Transfer of Undertakings Protection of Employment) legalisation. The Remuneration Committee and The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity's Trustee Board jointly agreed that the Charity should establish its own separate remuneration committee. Mark Aedy, Chair of the Remuneration Committee and Senior Independent Director Very senior managers' remuneration policy The Royal Marsden is committed to the overarching principles of value for money and high performance. The Trust must attract and retain a high calibre senior management team and workforce in order to ensure it maintains its excellent standards of clinical outcomes and patient care, functions efficiently and is well positioned to deliver the business strategy. The Remuneration Committee agreed a set of pay principles in 2015/16, which were reviewed in 2017/18, and these remain unchanged. As a Foundation Trust, the Remuneration Committee has the freedom to determine the appropriate remuneration level for very senior managers. In reaching its decisions, the Committee considers the responsibilities and requirements of the role, time in the role, marketability of the individual, internal relativities, benchmarking data from within the NHS or relevant sector, the external economic environment, NHS guidance and the performance of the Trust. Where the salary of an Executive Director is above \u00a3150,000, the Committee takes into consideration all these factors to satisfy itself that the remuneration is reasonable and appropriate. The Committee reviews the salaries of the Executive Directors and the Leadership Team annually when considering the cost of living pay increase. There is no automatic entitlement to an increase. The remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors and the Leadership Team are externally benchmarked every three years.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/1940 41Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is a subcommittee of the Board and is chaired by Mark Aedy, NonExecutive Director, with core membership comprising of the Chairman and currently one NonExecutive Director (Ian Farmer). The option to attend Remuneration Committee meetings is made available to other NonExecutive Directors where appropriate. The Chief Executive attends meetings in an advisory capacity and the Director of Workforce attends as and when required by the Committee. The latter provides advice and information on payrelated matters. External benchmarking data is sought from pay specialists such Hays Recruitment and NHS Providers to inform discussions about the threeyear salary reviews.

The benefits valued are the member's accrued benefits and any contingent spouse's pension payable from the scheme. A CETV is a payment made by a pension scheme, or arrangement to secure pension benefits in another pension scheme, or arrangement when the member leaves a scheme and chooses to transfer the benefits accrued in their former scheme. The pension figures shown relate to the benefits that the individual has accrued as a consequence of their total membership of the pension scheme, not just their service in a senior capacity to which the disclosure applies. The CETV figures include the value of any pension benefits in another scheme or arrangement which the individual has transferred to the NHS pension scheme. They also include any additional pension benefit accrued to the member as a result of their purchasing additional years of pension service in the scheme at their own cost. CETVs are calculated within the guidelines and framework prescribed by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. NHS Pensions are still assessing the impact of the McCloud judgement in relation to changes to benefits in the NHS 2015 Scheme. The benefits and related CETVs disclosed do not allow for any potential future adjustments that may arise from this judgement.Disclosures required by the Health and Social Care Act Salary and pension entitlements of very senior managers A.

Workforce Strategy The Trust's Workforce Strategy, Aspiring to Excellence (2016-19), sets out The Royal Marsden's vision 'to attract, retain and develop the brightest and best people locally, nationally and internationally through the Trusts reputation for excellence in patient care, research and education and for its commitment to the health, wellbeing and experience of staff'. The strategy outlines six core priorities: recruitment, health and wellbeing, culture and engagement, retention, workforce transformation and operational excellence. The key driver behind the retention priority is 'to retain and develop a highly skilled and flexible workforce to meet the needs of our patients and health system'.Engaging our staff It is widely recognised that engaged and wellmotivated staff are key to delivering highquality care to patients. The Royal Marsden recognises the importance and value of having an engaged workforce. There are wellestablished mechanisms in place to encourage staff engagement and involvement. These include: Schwartz Rounds Schwartz rounds are a forum for staff from all backgrounds and levels to come together once a month to explore the psychological impact of their job role. Research has shown that they have a positive impact on individuals, relationships with patients and colleagues and the extent to which staff feel cared for. Approximately 500 staff attended a Schwartz Round during 2018/19. The topics covered included coping with the unexpected, breaking boundaries and experiencing a complaint. Attendees positively evaluated all the sessions. Schwartz Rounds continue to allow staff across every area of the Trust to get together and reflect on the challenges and dilemmas that they have faced while caring for patients. Staff have recognised in their feedback how attending the rounds have made them feel more involved and part of the wider organisation. Staff open meeting Led by the Chief Executive and members of the Leadership Team, regular staff open meetings continued in 2018/19 to enable twoway communication with staff about key strategic issues facing the Trust. These meetings allow the Leadership Team to share updates and actions around Trust performance and encourage engagement in how this could be further improved. Notably in 2019, the meetings were used to launch the new FiveYear Strategic Plan, to which staff had contributed, and to celebrate the outstanding CQC results. Leadership rounds Members of the Leadership Team are committed to increasing visibility across the organisation and use informal walk rounds to different parts of the Trust to engage and listen.Disability policy The Trust has an equality and diversity policy, which sets out the framework through which it delivers its services and provides employment. All staff are required to attend mandatory equality and diversity training, which is refreshed every three years. Bespoke training is also developed, for example cultural awareness training for frontline staff, focusing on the needs of patients from the Middle East. The Trust is a Disability Confident Employer and this accreditation replaces the Disability Two Ticks symbol, but continues to support a guaranteed interview scheme to make sure that full and fair consideration is given to applications from candidates with disabilities. The Trust's Managing Absence Policies ensure that when staff become disabled in the course of employment, active steps are taken and reasonable adjustments made to enable staff to remain employed. All of the Trust's people management policies apply equally to staff with and without disabilities. Key progress in 2018/19 included the launch of The Royal Marsden's partnership with AccessAble (formerly known as DisabledGo). AccessAble provide online access guides for the hospital services, which aim to improve the experience of all of patients and visitors, but particularly those with disabilities. There have also been significant developments to support patients with dementia, which was noted in the Trust's PatientLed Assessments of the Care Environment (PLACE). The Trust was the winner of the 'Best UK employer of the year' award at the Nursing Times Workforce Summit Awards 2018. The judges commented on how the Trust addressed equality and diversity and that it has a \"genuine commitment to support staff across the organisation\". The Trust has three staff equality networks, including a network for staff with disabilities and health conditions, which was launched in 2018. All of these networks are run jointly with the ICR.Education and training Building Educational Excellence (2016-2021) is The Royal Marsden's multiprofessional education strategy. The Trust's vision is that through excellence in education The Royal Marsden will continue to achieve the very highest levels of patient care, service delivery and research across cancer care and be recognised as a leader in multiprofessional oncology education and training. This will enable the Trust to maintain its reputation as a bestinclass employer. There are five key objectives in the strategy linked to the Trust's strategic priorities: -Ensure staff have the skills for safe, effective and compassionate care -Pioneer the delivery of the new multiprofessional workforce aligned to new models of cancer care, community care and precision medicine -Enable robust valuesbased leadership and management at all levels -Grow the Trust's national market share and develop its international role as a leading supplier of multiprofessional education -Continuously develop the research awareness and capability of the workforce. The 2019 annual Excellence in Education Conference celebrated achievements against these objectives, including the CQC commendation that the Trust's approach to supporting education and training demonstrated 'outstanding practice'. Wideranging leadership programmes offered by the Trust were extended in 2018/19, with the introduction of an additional Connected Programme for Matrons. The Academic Health Science Centre (AHSC) Leadership Programme, in partnership with Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, also continued, with a new cohort of multiprofessional participants, including consultants. In the General Medical Council (GMC) Trainee Survey 2018, the Trust ranked first in London on eight indicators, including induction, educational governance, educational supervision, regional teaching and study leave.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/1948 49 -Formal onetoone counselling and support services continue to be available to all staff, on request, via the OHD and staff support services -Attendance management referrals are one of the core activities undertaken by the OHD. Case conferences are encouraged to support managers in attendance management and enable successful rehabilitation back into the workplace -Selfreferral for sickness absence is available for staff who are concerned about their own attendance -Fasttrack physiotherapy is provided for staff for appropriate effective intervention for musculoskeletal conditions, promoting an early return to work with effective rehabilitation programmes to facilitate resumption of full work activity -Vaccines are provided for all staff travelling abroad. Travel vaccines are offered to the wider community at competitive rates. The OHD remains an important resource for all staff to help them maintain their health and wellbeing at work. The department aims to continue to develop the service in line with the Trust's health and wellbeing strategy for the future. Engaging junior doctors The Director of Medical Education has worked with management and clinical colleagues to improve the engagement of junior medical staff by running a number of internal feedback surveys and working with them to identify solutions to issues related to education, recruitment and the working environment. The Trust provides a range of leadership development opportunities, including a Paired Learning Programme which engages junior doctors in leading quality improvement projects. The Trust has also appointed a Guardian of Safe Working to support junior doctors to raise concerns about safe ways of working.Freedom to Speak Up The Trust has a NonExecutive Lead for Freedom to Speak Up, a Freedom to Speak Up Guardian and a network of divisional champions who support staff to raise any concerns they might have about patient services or workforce matters. The champion role supports and works in line with the Trust's arrangements for its whistleblowing policy, ensuring that the individual raising the concern has the correct information about the policy and procedure, and feels supported through the process. Counter fraud As part of our drive to encourage staff to raise concerns, the Trust has policies and procedures in place to support staff to raise concerns about fraud, potential fraud or any misconduct of a similar nature.Weekly bulletins and quarterly briefings To ensure key messages are communicated to all members of the Trust, a weekly bulletin is circulated highlighting events, news and celebrations. In addition, members of the Leadership Team also send out regular briefings on key messages and strategic priorities of the Trust. Clinical Tuesdays Each Tuesday the Chief Nurse and a team of senior nurses go 'back on the floor', meaning they work in clinical areas in practice, to support staff and enable a twoway dialogue about quality improvements using a newly - introduced ward accreditation system. Above and Beyond Awards The Trust's Above and Beyond Awards are a reward and recognition scheme, granted quarterly to nonclinical and clinical teams and individuals. In 2018/19, 106 staff were recognised through the scheme's individual or team awards. Long Service Awards A total of 208 staff were recognised for long service in 2018/19, with tenures ranging from 10 to 40 years. Attended by the Chairman and Chief Executive, the award ceremonies are warmly welcomed by staff. Staff Achievement Awards Ceremony The annual Staff Achievement Awards Ceremony was attended by over 900 staff members in 2019. Over 200 nominations were received for the six categories which recognised outstanding contribution of both teams and individuals, during the year. Partnership working The Trust has an active Trust Consultative Committee that is a forum for management and staff side colleagues to work in partnership. The Trust also has an Employment Partnership Group that meets quarterly. Both of these groups enable the Trust to consult with its employees and their representatives to ensure appropriate involvement in changes across the organisation.Health and wellbeing The Trust has continued to build on, and enhance, the health and wellbeing offer; to support staff to feel good, be healthy and live well. This includes a range of physical activities, healthy eating, financial education and mental health support. In 2018/19, biannual health and wellbeing events continued to be held. Staff attended the events to find out more about how they could improve their health and gain more knowledge of benefits and discounts available to staff. National campaigns were promoted, including Blood Pressure Awareness Week and World Mental Health Day, which were well attended by staff. Throughout the year, approximately 750 staff attended health and wellbeing events. Occupational Health and Wellbeing Department The Occupational Health and Wellbeing Department (OHD) exists to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of all Trust employees. The OHD has maintained the Safe Effective Quality Occupational Health Service (SEQOHS) accreditation over the past year. The SEQOHS accreditation is an evidence based assessment of a set of standards to drive continuous improvement in the quality of services provided to clients. The OHD continues to works closely with other teams within the hospital, including staff support services, infection prevention and control, and risk management. Working alongside the Human Resources Department, the OHD enables managers to obtain support and information to manage both shortand longterm sickness absence. -8,847 appointments were given in this financial year delivering a service to both Trust staff and staff from other organisations to whom a service is provided -The seasonal influenza vaccination programmes is offered to all staff to protect patients, staff and their families.

The NHS Staff Survey is conducted annually. The results from questions are grouped to give scores for ten themes. Each theme has been given a score out of ten. The response rate to the 2018 survey among Trust staff was 53 per cent, compared with 54 per cent in 2017. Scores for each theme are shown in the table below, along with benchmarking data comparing the Trust with other acute specialist trusts. Overall, 80 per cent of the themes (8 out of 10) from the NHS Staff Survey were rated as above average. This is reflective of the successful year The Royal Marsden had last year, when it achieved a CQC 'outstanding' rating. The Trust achieved the best national scores compared with other acute specialist trusts for two themes: immediate managers and staff engagement.

In addition, the Trust will further develop the model of mental wellbeing support in the workplace, including introducing mental health first aid training and roll out a multiprofessional campaign focusing on staff accessing food and hydration, and tackling fatigue due to their shift patterns. Equality, diversity and inclusion The Trust will continue to roll out cultural awareness training and work with the Leadership Team, to further develop this to improve the experience for staff. In addition, in 2019/20, the Trust will look to improve transparency in recruitment processes, as well as improving the attraction approach for applicants, focus on 'leading inclusively' through the leadership and development programme, and work more collaboratively with the staff networks (LGBT, BAME and disability) to gain further insight into the Staff Survey results and agree action plans. This will build on the work that is happening across London in line with the Workforce Race Equality Scheme (WRES) and the upcoming Workforce Disability Equality (WDES). Team working The Trust wants to build on the high scores it has received in a number of themes by continuing to support managers with team working. This will involve staff engagement events to develop Trust values and support for these values being incorporated into employment practices. Team objective setting will also be encouraged, to support cohesive working practices; a set of standards for 121 meetings will be introduced across all professions; and negative behaviours within teams will be addressed at an earlier stage through a revised workforce resolution framework. Governance and monitoring Each division within the Trust will be asked to develop a local workforce and staff engagement action plan, based on their individual scores. The divisional plans will be reviewed through the Workforce and Education Committee, alongside the organisational priorities.

Members and Governors As a Foundation Trust, The Royal Marsden has members which are made up of its patients and carers, public and staff. Patient and carer membership The patient constituency is subdivided into the following geographical areas: -Kensington and Chelsea -Sutton and Merton -Elsewhere in London -Elsewhere in England. Anyone living in these areas that has been a patient at the Trust within the last five years can become a member of the relevant patient subconstituency. There is also a carer subconstituency, which is open to individuals who care for current patients of the hospital or who have cared for a former patient of the hospital within the last five years. Public membership The public constituency comprises of individuals who live within the following three geographical areas: -Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea -London Boroughs of Sutton and Merton -Elsewhere in England.Staff membership The staff constituency comprises individuals who are employed by the Trust, hold an honorary contract with the Trust, or hold an honorary contract with the Trust and our academic partner the ICR.

Stakeholders such as clinical commissioning groups and local authorities are also represented on the Council of Governors. The Council of Governors has a number of statutory and regulatory responsibilities which are reflected in the Trust's Constitution. These include, but are not limited to, the appointment or removal of NonExecutive Directors, the appointment or removal of the Trust's external auditor and receiving the Trust's Annual Report and Accounts as well as the auditor's report on this publication. The Health and Social Care Act 2012 introduced the following two legal duties: to hold NonExecutive Directors to account for their performance of the Board; and to represent the interests of the members of the Trust and public in their role. Governors are able to canvass the opinion of the members through the Council of Governors meetings and working groups. Members are free to raise any concerns or submit any questions to their Governor and are reminded of this throughout the year in Trust communications. Governors are invited to have onetoone feedback sessions with the Trust Secretary to discuss their individual development needs. A collective evaluation of the performance of the Council of Governors will be carried out in June 2019.Composition of the Council of Governors As previously noted, the Trust has various constituencies for its members, i.e. patients/ public and staff. Members vote for their Governors and therefore Governors represent those members under their constituency. The table on page 58 illustrates this. As of the 31 March 2019, there were 23 seats on the Council of Governors, comprising 17 elected Governors (Patient and Carer, Public and Staff Governors) and six appointed stakeholder and partner Governors. The table below shows details of the Governors, their terms of office and attendance at meetings of the Council of Governors and the Annual General Meeting in 2018/19.Member recruitment Some of the member recruitment activities and initiatives undertaken in 2018/19 include: -Personalised welcome letters from the Chief Executive and Medical Director to new patients at the point of registration, inviting them to become a member -Holding an annual Members' Week in April, led by the Governors -Membership leaflets displayed around the hospital across both sites -Reference to membership in patient information booklets -'Member get member' schenme encouraging existing members to invite others to become a member -Membership link on the homepage of the Trust website -Governors visiting local schools to encourage them to become members -Engaging with the Trust's volunteers and registering new volunteers as public members, as well as promoting membership on their information leaflets. Member engagement The Trust has two levels of membership to differentiate the level of involvement a member wishes to have and to help manage resources more efficiently. Member engagement activities undertaken over the past year include: -All members receive an electronic copy of the quarterly RM magazine, which promotes the work of the Trust, the Council of Governors, Board of Directors and membership. The magazine also has a wide circulation to patients and the general public -Three member events were held in 2018/19; two in London and one in Sutton. As part of membership engagement, the November event sought members' views on the Trust's quality priorities for 2019/20 -Members are invited to participate in surveys and focus groups, for example the Trust's PatientLed Assessments of the Care Environment (PLACE), and members were asked to give feedback on the Trust's quality improvements priorities for 2019/20 via an online survey prior to the November members' event -The Annual General Meeting held in September 2018 included presentations on 'The Royal Marsden: pioneers in robotic surgery' from Professor Vinidh Paleri, Consultant Head and Neck Surgeon, followed by a presentation on 'Artificial Intelligence: improving radiology treatments' from Dr Christina Messiou, Consultant Radiologist. Becoming a member Anyone aged 16 years old or over and who lives in England can become a member of The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. There are several ways in which a person can sign up to become a member. They can pick a form up from around the hospital or via the Trust website: www. royalmarsden.nhs.uk/gettinginvolved/ foundationtrustmembership/becomemember All membership enquiries are directed to the Corporate Governance team using the following details: Post Corporate Governance The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Fulham Road London SW3 6JJ Email trust.foundation@rmh.nhs.uk or contact a Governor at governors@rmh.nhs.uk Telephone 020 7808 2844 Members of the public can also contact the Corporate Governance team to request a copy of the Register of Governors' and Board of Directors Interests or visit the Trust website, where this information is published.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/1958 59Governor Fiona Stewart was appointed as the Lead Governor of the Council of Governors in August 2018, for a term of two years. The Lead Governor acts as a twoway conduit between NHS Improvement (NHSI) and the Council of Governors in specific circumstances where it may not be appropriate to communicate through the normal channels. The main circumstances where NHSI will contact a Lead Governor is if there are concerns as to Board leadership or if the appointment of a Chairman or other Board member may not have complied with the Trust's Constitution or may be inappropriate. Election to the Council of Governors All Governors hold terms of office for a period of three years and are eligible for reelection or reappointment to serve a maximum of nine years. The Electoral Reform Services manage the provision of the elections for the Trust in accordance with the Model Rules for Elections. One election was held during 2018/19. Governor's expenses The Trust's expenses policy ensures that Governors are appropriately reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in the course of carrying out their duties. For the year ending 31 March 2019, the total amount claimed by Governors was \u00a31,205.72. Linking the Council of Governors to the Board of Directors It is important that the Council of Governors and Board of Directors work together for the benefit of our patient and local community. There are several ways in which the two bodies achieve this. The Chairman of the Board of Directors is also the Chair of the Council of Governors. The Executive Directors and NonExecutive Directors regularly attend the Council of Governor meetings. Governors are invited to attend public Board of Directors meetings where they can observe firsthand the Board in business and, in particular, the performance of NonExecutive Directors.The Council of Governors also receives an annual report regarding the work of the Board SubCommittees, the Audit and Finance Committee, and the Quality, Assurance and Risk Committee. This report is presented by the Chairs of the Committees (who are also NonExecutive Directors) and highlights the committees' main business and risks for the year specified. In situations where any conflict arises between the Board of Directors and the Council of Governors, the Trust's internal dispute resolution procedure shall be adhered to which notes that the decision of the Chairman shall be final. However, there may be circumstances where the Chairman feels unable to decide owing to a conflict of interest. In such situations, the Chairman will initiate an independent review to investigate and make recommendations. Normally this will be achieved by inviting the Senior Independent Director to conduct the review and the choice of the individual will be agreed by both the Board of Directors and the Council of Governors.Governors' terms of office and attendance at meetings 2018/19 Governor Constituency/organisation Term of office End of current termMeetings attended Total meetings = 7 Patient and Carer Governors Maggie Harkness Kensington and Chelsea & Sutton and Merton 2nd May 2019 6 Armine Afrikian Kensington and Chelsea & Sutton and Merton 1st May 2019 6 Colin Peel Kensington and Chelsea & Sutton and Merton 2nd July 2019 6 Fiona Stewart* Elsewhere in London 2nd May 2019 7 Dr Peter Lewins Elsewhere in London 2nd May 2018 1 out of 1 Dr Andrew Pearson Elsewhere in England 1st May 2019 6 Simon Spevack Elsewhere in England 2nd May 2019 5 LesleyAnn Gooden Carer 3rd May 2019 5 Duncan Campbell Carer 2nd May 2019 7 Public Governors Dr Carol Joseph Kensington and Chelsea 3rd July 2020 7 Tim Howlett Sutton and Merton 1st May 2019 4 Ros McTaggart Elsewhere in England 1st May 2019 6 Dr Ann Smith Elsewhere in England 1st April 2021 5 Staff Governors Hardev Sagoo Corporate and Support Services 2nd May 2020 6 Rachel Nabawanuka Clinical Professionals 1st May 2019 5 Dr Jayne Wood Doctor 1st August 2019 6 Mo Carruthers Nurse 2nd August 2019 6 Nominated Governors Dr Charmaine Griffiths The Institute of Cancer Research 2nd February 2022 5 Cllr Robert Freeman Local Authority: Borough of Kensington & Chelsea 3rd July 2020 5 Anne Croudass Cancer Research UK (Charity) 2nd May 2021 3 Chris Elliott Sutton Clinical Commissioning Group 2nd February 2019 0 Cllr David Bartolucci Local Authority: London Borough Sutton & Merton 1st October 2021 2 out of 3 Cllr Simon Wales Local Authority: London Borough Sutton & Merton 1st September 2020 0 out of 2 Dr Philip Mackney West London Clinical Commissioning Group 2nd February 2019 0 * Lead GovernorThe Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/1960 61Statement of Accounting Officer's responsibility The NHS Act 2006 states that the Chief Executive is the Accounting Officer of the NHS Foundation Trust.

NHSI, in exercise of the powers conferred on Monitor by the NHS Act 2006, has given Accounts Directions which require The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust to prepare for each financial year a statement of accounts in the form and on the basis required by those directions. The accounts are prepared on an accruals basis and must give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust and of its income and expenditure, total recognised gains and losses and cash flows for the financial year. In preparing the accounts, the Accounting Officer is required to comply with the requirements of the Department of Health and Social Care Group Accounting Manual and in particular to: -observe the Accounts Direction issued by NHSI, including the relevant accounting and disclosure requirements, and apply suitable accounting policies on a consistent basis -make judgements and estimates on a reasonable basis -state whether applicable accounting standards as set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual (and the Department of Health Group Accounting Manual) have been followed, and disclose and explain any material departures in the financial statements -confirm that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for patients, regulators and stakeholders to assess the NHS Foundation Trust's performance, business model and strategy -ensure that the use of public funds complies with the relevant legislation, delegated authorities and guidance -prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. The Accounting Officer is responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the NHS Foundation Trust and to enable him/her to ensure that the accounts comply with requirements outlined in the above mentioned Act. The Accounting Officer is also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the NHS Foundation Trust and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. To the best of my knowledge and belief, I have properly discharged the responsibilities set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Memorandum . Cally Palmer CBE Chief Executive 23 May 2019 NHS Improvement's Single Oversight Framework NHS Improvement's Single Oversight Framework provides the framework for overseeing providers and identifying potential support needs. The framework looks at five themes: -Quality of care -Finance and use of resources -Operational performance -Strategic change -Leadership and improvement capability (well led). Based on information from these themes, providers are segmented from 1 to 4, where 4 reflects providers receiving the most support, and 1 reflects providers with maximum autonomy. A foundation trust will only be in segments 3 or 4 where it has been found to be in breach or suspected breach of its licence. Segmentation As at 31 March 2019, the Trust has been placed in segment 1. Current segmentation information for NHS trusts and foundation trusts is published on the NHS Improvement website. Finance and use of resources The finance and use of resources theme is based on the scoring of five measures from 1 to 4, where 1 reflects the strongest performance. These scores are then weighted to give an overall score. Given that finance and use of resources is only one of the five themes feeding into the Single Oversight Framework, the segmentation of the trust disclosed above might not be the same as the overall finance score here.

Guidance for staff is provided through training programmes and information is available in the Risk Management Policy. This is supported by the Accident/Incident and Patient Safety Incident Reporting Policy Including Serious Incidents Requiring Investigation, which supports a culture of fairness, openness and learning within the organisation. Incidents of any severity including a near miss are reported on the Trustwide Datix system. Significant incidents require a panel review and the results of the root cause analysis, including best practice recommendations, are fed back through all the relevant clinical bodies in the Trust to commissioners via the Clinical Quality Review Group, and internally from the Board QAR Committee through the Clinical Advisory Group, the Nursing, Rehabilitation and Radiography Committee, the Matrons, Sisters and Staff Nurses Forums, and Junior Doctors forums. All policies relating to risk management are easily accessible and available to staff on the hospital intranet policy section, with supporting information available under the risk management department section. Data security incidents and risk are managed through the Information Governance Committee, chaired by the Caldicott Guardian and attended by the Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO) and Data Protection Officer (DPO). The Trust Board receives scheduled updates on all information governance and exceptional reports should the need arise. The Trust is constantly seeking to learn and share best practice in relation to risk and quality. An example is the 2018/19 joint E. coli Cancer Collaborative, where The Royal Marsden, The Christie NHS Foundation Trust and NHS Improvement have developed and led a quality collaborative for cancer clinicians across England with the aim to reduce E. coli bacteraemia in cancer patients who are particularly susceptible to the infection. This collaborative has also resulted in the first joint clinical E. coli Improvement Fellow appointment between both organisations, with the aim of developing best practice in E. coli management across the UK's two largest cancer centres.4. The Risk and Control Framework Oversight of effective risk management by the Board of Directors is underpinned by four interlocking systems of control: - Organisational risk management - Board Assurance Framework - Internal and external audit - The Annual Governance Statement. Organisational risk management The systematic identification, analysis and control of risks are a key organisational responsibility. A culture of ownership and responsibility for risk management/patient safety is fostered throughout the organisation, and all managers and clinicians undertake risk management as one of their fundamental duties. The Risk Management Policy has been approved by the Board and the QAR Committee. It defines the process for the systematic identification and control of risks. It clearly defines accountability structures, roles and responsibilities. The overarching risk appetite approach taken by the Trust is firstly to maintain or enhance its patient safety, patient experience and CQC 'outstanding' position. The second approach is to maintain its performance within an appropriate use of resources. The Board and divisional leadership consider the risk appetite when assessing and calculating risk scores. They also carefully consider this when reviewing Cost Improvement Programme (CIP) Quality Impact Assessments. The policy details the process for risk identification and evaluation using a standardised risk assessment matrix and sets out the levels of authority for the management of identified risk. During 2018/19, there were no 'Never Events' at the Trust. The policy has been disseminated throughout the Trust and communicated to key stakeholders. The Trust's procedures for reporting and investigating accidents, nonclinical incidents, near misses and patient safety incidents aim to support active learning and to ensure that the lessons learnt from these events are embedded into the organisation's culture and practices. Learning from incidents is an essential part of integrated governance and risk management within the Trust and also a requirement of the Annual Governance Statement 1. Scope of responsibility As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for maintaining a sound system of internal control to support the achievement of The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust's policies, aims and objectives, while safeguarding the public funds and departmental assets for which I am personally responsible, in accordance with the responsibilities assigned to me. I am also responsible for ensuring that The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust is administered prudently and economically and that resources are applied efficiently and effectively. I also acknowledge my responsibilities as set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Memorandum . 2. The purpose of the system of internal control The system of internal control is designed to manage risk to a reasonable level rather than to eliminate all risk of failure to achieve policies, aims and objectives; it can therefore only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance of effectiveness. The system of internal control is based on an ongoing process designed to identify and prioritise the risks to the achievement of the policies, aims and objectives of The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, to evaluate the likelihood of those risks being realised and the impact should they be realised, and to manage them efficiently, effectively and economically. The system of internal control has been in place in The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust for the year ended 31 March 2019 and up to the date of approval of the annual reports and accounts. 3. Capacity to handle risk As Accounting Officer I have overall accountability for risk management in the Trust. I have delegated responsibility for the coordination of risk management systems and processes to the Chief Nurse, who discharges this responsibility through the Risk Management and Quality Assurance teams. These teams lead on the Care Quality Commission (CQC), the Trust risk register, and incident reporting management system.The Board of Directors also plays an important role in terms of the organisation's capacity to manage risk. It provides overall leadership and commitment to establishing effective risk management systems across the organisation. Strategic risk is monitored via the Board Assurance Framework. The purpose of the Board Assurance Framework (BAF) is to present the Trust's risk assurance framework in the context of the Trust's strategic objectives, as set out in the FiveYear Strategic Plan 2018/19- 2023/24. Detailed operational risks can be found in the Risk Register, which is presented to the Quality, Assurance and Risk Committee (QAR). This is also aligned with the FiveYear Strategic Plan. The QAR Committee is a subCommittee of the Board and is responsible for approving the clinical management of risk and monitoring the implementation of risk management arrangements within the NHS Foundation Trust. This includes assurance that the Trust complies with its obligations regarding CQC registration. The Chair of the QAR Committee is a NonExecutive Director with senior health service experience. Membership comprises NonExecutive Directors (including the Trust Chairman) and Executive Directors (including the Chief Executive, Chief Nurse, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Medical Director). This Committee works alongside the Audit and Finance Committee to help manage risk, which, as another subcommittee of the Board, contributes independently to the Board's overall process for ensuring that an effective internal financial control system is maintained. This Committee is chaired by a NonExecutive Director with financial experience and qualification, and membership includes other NonExecutive Directors. Risk management is firmly embedded in the activity of the organisation, and operational responsibility for risk identification and control is delegated to individual Directors and Senior Managers who have functional responsibility within their areas of management. Risk management training is provided to every member of staff at induction and is part of the annual mandatory training programme. The Head of Risk Management is responsible for providing advice and expertise to all staff. Specific ongoing training is determined through the appraisal and personal development The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/1964 65The QAR Committee oversees and monitors the performance of the IGRM. The QAR Committee is responsible for ensuring that effective arrangements are in place for the oversight and monitoring of all aspects of clinical quality and safety, including identifying potential risks to the quality of clinical care. Every quarter, frontline clinical staff report to the QAR Committee and describe the positive aspects of the Trust's research, education and care, and also areas that require improvement. Audit and Finance Committee (AFC) The AFC oversees the financial risk and provides confidence in the objectivity and fairness of financial reporting, providing assurance about the adequacy of internal controls, the safeguarding of assets and in reducing the risk of illegal or improper acts. The AFC also reinforces the importance, independence and effectiveness of internal and external audits. Internal Audit (KPMG) works closely with this Committee and provides assurance on the systems of control operating within the Trust. The Board Assurance Framework The Board Assurance Framework identifies the Trust's strategic objectives, key risks to achieving the objectives, including risks in relation to the Trust's Foundation Trust Licence condition, and the controls and assurance mechanisms in place to mitigate the risks. The Trust reviewed and updated the Board Assurance Framework in 2018/19 and monitors the assurances it receives against the Framework, and reviews progress on the action plans drawn up to close the gaps in both controls and assurance.Internal Audit and antifraud activities The results of Internal Audit reviews are reported to the AFC, which oversees the action required, addressing any system weaknesses. Procedures are in place to monitor the implementation of control improvements and to undertake followup reviews when required. An Internal Audit action recommendation tracking system is in place, which records progress in implementing the recommendations by management. Management's progress in implementing corrective action following Internal Audit recommendations is reported to the AFC, and the Executive Board also receives reports on high and medium issues. The AntiFraud programme is led by the Chief Financial Officer with support from KPMG and is monitored by the AFC. Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE) The Trust is committed to having an effective structure for patient and public involvement and engagement at all levels within the organisation. Thus, a new role of PPIE Lead was created, and the new Lead was recruited in February 2019. A mapping exercise has been undertaken to demonstrate PPIE activity and how all groups interact and function. The PPIE Lead is currently revising the overarching PPIE Strategy, to be implemented in 2019. Trust governance and services As an NHS Foundation Trust, governance and strategic direction is provided by the Council of Governors, of which two thirds are Patient, Carer and Public Governors. The longestablished Patient and Carer Advisory Group (PCAG) acts as a focus for all local patient involvement initiatives, often working alongside the Governors. This group leads on a number of activities including a 'Listening Post' (an opportunity to provide feedback on activities of the Trust) across sites and clinics twice a month. In addition, there are also other engagement groups such as the Youth Forum, workshops and discussion groups. There are also discharge workshops which engage specific groups of patients and carers.Accident/Incident and Patient Safety Incident Reporting Policy Including Serious Incidents Requiring Investigation. Risk management and incident reporting processes identify risks of all levels of severity throughout the organisation. These processes feed into the divisional risk registers, which are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Risks that score above 12 are included on the Trust risk register, which is reviewed and reported to the QAR Committee, with the key risks being reported to the Board. Current highlevel risks that score 15 or above, in line with many trusts nationally, are those that reflect the challenging national financial climate and requirement to modernise infrastructure and information technology across the NHS: - Financial sustainability - failure to maintain financial stability due to the challenging financial environment - Information technology - threat of cyberattack or other major system failure - Infrastructure - stem cell laboratory premises - Achieving key national targets - such as the 62day national cancer waiting times target. Examples of risks that score above 12 are again common with most NHS organisations, and include: - Increased demand for services, placing pressure on space and capacity to deliver care - Replacing essential equipment - Recruitment of specialist staff. Various methods of risk control are in place. For financial sustainability there is a business plan which is monitored by the Performance Review Group, Audit and Finance Committee and the Trust Board. This is underpinned by Private Care's growth strategy, strong financial controls and the efficiency programme as part of the 2018/19 plan. Strategic and transformational options are being considered and developed to achieve financial sustainability. This includes the Trust developing the Cancer Vanguard to assist the two Sustainability and Transformation Partnerships in south west and north west London.The above risk, and those that score above 12, have associated highlevel action plans, which are updated quarterly, with the risk scores being adjusted as the level of risk is reduced. These risks are reviewed and reported to the QAR Committee, with the key risks being reported to the Board. Key national targets, such as the 62day national cancer waiting times target, are influenced by longwaiting patients who have had pathway delays prior to their referral to The Royal Marsden. The Trust manages risks such as these by working closely with both RM Partners and the south west London leadership forum, where a shared work programme is in place to address the causes of poor performance. The Trust's own action plan with regards to this risk is monitored at the monthly Performance Group, chaired by the Director of Performance and Information, and progress is reported directly to the Board on a monthly basis. The Trust is also involved, through Borough Resilience Forums and Regional Emergency Planning Network Groups, in extensive multiagency risk reduction and emergency planning work. This is in accordance with the Civil Contingencies Act and against the national, regional and borough risk registers. Risk assessments have been carried out against emergency preparedness and civil contingency requirements. The Trust provides assurance to NHS England on its resilience procedures and has maintained accreditation against ISO 22301 for its Business Continuity Management System. Integrated Governance and Risk Management Committee (IGRM) IGRM is cochaired by the Chief Nurse, and the Medical Director has the delegated responsibility for oversight and monitoring of all aspects of quality and risk including review of serious incidents, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance compliance and policy/guideline approval, emergency planning and research governance.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/1966 67As an employer with staff entitled to membership of the NHS Pension Scheme, control measures are in place to ensure all employer obligations contained within the Scheme regulations are complied with. This includes ensuring that deductions from salary, employer's contributions and payments into the Scheme are in accordance with the Scheme rules, and that member Pension Scheme records are accurately updated in accordance with the timescales detailed in the Regulations. Control measures are in place to ensure that all the organisation's obligations under equality, diversity and human rights legislation are complied with. The Trust has undertaken risk assessments and has a Sustainable Development Management Plan in place which takes account of UK Climate Projections 2018 (UKCP18). The Trust ensures that its obligations under the Climate Change Act and the Adaptation Reporting requirements are complied with. The Trust is committed to ensuring that staffing levels are safe across all professional groups. The Trust is compliant with NHS Improvement 'Developing Workforce Safeguards' (2018) guidance, taking a triangulated approach to safer staffing - utilising evidencebased tools (such as Safer Nursing Care Tool), professional judgement (led by the Chief Nurse, Medical Director or Head of Therapies) and quality outcomes - such as key nurse or medical sensitive indicators and workforce trends. In 2018/19, the Chief Nurse presented a detailed safer staffing paper on two occasions to the Board of Directors. This report detailed the outcomes of the Chief Nurse led Safer Staffing Reviews. From April 2019, this board paper will also include assurance across all professional groups, including medicine and staff allied to medicine. In addition, the Board also receives a monthly safer staffing position delivered by the Chief Nurse. To support decisions, the Trust has fully deployed the Safer Nursing Care Tool across all inpatient wards. A children's Safer Staffing Tool is now also fully implemented. In 2018/19, allied health professionals (AHPs) from the Trust participated in a NHS Improvement safer staffing masterclass to build capability and expertise outside the nursing profession. Within nursing the Trust is proud that its Nurse Staffing Lead was awarded a Chief Nursing Officer (CNO) Safer Staffing Fellowship in 2018/19, further securing our commitment to ensuring we have the highest levels of expertise and capability across all staff groups. In 2019, the Trust aims to participate in the NHS Improvement staff retention initiative. Strategically, the Trust plans carefully and thoroughly to ensure that it has the right staff, with the right skills, to meet patient needs now, and in support of the FiveYear Strategic Plan and the NHS Cancer Workforce Plan. An example of this is detailed medical workforce planning to ensure the Trust meets national earlier and faster diagnosis objectives of the Long Term Plan. The Trust aims to be a system leader in workforce planning for the cancer workforce and is working with colleagues in NHS Improvement to develop the UK's first (nurse) Ambulatory Care Safer Staffing Tool. Operationally, the Director of Workforce and Chief Nurse chair a fortnightly Nurse and AHP Recruitment and Retention meeting. This Trustwide multidisciplinary team forum supports the divisions in scanning for future recruitment and retention threats to safe staffing across the professions. This includes potential threats from Brexit. The Chief Nurse 'huddles' with matrons and the senior team each week to review 'staffing red flags', nurse sensitive indicators, and patient and staff experience. Additionally, site teams and senior nurses use realtime staffing and acuity data to make informed staffing decisions throughout the 24hour period, reporting to the leadership team every 12 hours. The Royal Marsden is working with NHS Improvement and other cancer centres to develop a pioneering Ambulatory Care/Medical Day Unit Acuity Tool. The Trust is agile and responsive to fluctuations in demand and this has resulted in 'inyear' modifications to staffing to ensure patient care is safe; for example, increasing theatre, clinical nurse specialist (CNS) and medical day unit staffing in 2018/19. In 2018/19, the Trust reviewed its valuable CNS workforce and this work will continue into 2019/20. In addition, the Trust is also reviewing staffing 24/7 - notably Safer Staffing at Night - across all professional groups.The Governors and the PCAG also link with other governance, patient experience and quality accounts, committees and initiatives. The Governors and frontline staff lead a Patient Experience and Quality Account Group which scrutinises the Quality Report and all key performance and quality metrics in the Trust. The Trust IGRM Committee has two patient/ carer representatives from the PCAG on it as core members. Governors and representatives from the PCAG are working alongside Trust staff in the Patient Experience Strategy Group, chaired by the Chief Nurse. Research Across the Trust's research activities there are various models of patient and public involvement and engagement. The NIHR Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) has a Patient Representatives Working Group. In this group, a patient representative supports the work of each of its eight themes and two patient representatives are also members of the BRC Steering Group. Three patient representatives support the work of the Clinical Research Facility and are members of its management committee. A Patient and Carer Review Panel reviews protocols and research material. Open engagement events are coproduced with patients and carer representatives to drive awareness about research and developments, and there are at least 15 projects where patients and carers are coapplicants and coproducers. A PPIE Steering Group contributes to the direction of the research portfolio and research design, and works closely with the Institute of Cancer Research and national bodies such as the NIHR INVOLVE and Commissioning Group. Quality and safety The Trust was inspected by the CQC in May 2018 and received an overall rating of 'outstanding' as a provider of services, with 'outstanding' for 'caring, responsive and well led', and 'good' for 'safe and effective'. As part of the CQC's ongoing monitoring process, a CQC Inspector meets every quarter with the Chief Nurse, Chief Operating Officer and the Medical Director.To ensure that the Trust's Board, Council of Governors, Commissioners, Executive Board and frontline staff regularly review performance against the CQC's fundamental standards in order to comply with the regulations of the Health and Safety Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations (2014), the Trust publishes a portfolio of quality and performance documents: - Annual Quality Report - Monthly Quality Report - Quarterly Integrated Governance Monitoring Report The Board of Directors also approves the Board SelfCertification Report on an annual basis which, following a review of evidence undertaken by the Board subCommittees, confirms the Trust's compliance against the requirements set out in the Corporate Governance Statement and conditions of its Licence. Furthermore, the Board undertakes an annual 'well led' selfassessment exercise to evaluate its effectiveness against the Key Lines of Enquiry. The Integrated Governance Monitoring Report includes details on compliance with the CQC's fundamental standards and is grouped using the five key questions: - Is care safe? - Is care effective? - Are staff caring? - Are staff responsive to people's needs? - Are staff well led? In line with the recommendations from the National Quality Board, the Trust published its nurse staffing levels from June 2014 to demonstrate safe staffing levels. The Board sees the staffing levels each month in the Quality Report. Workforce safeguards The Trust is fully compliant with the registration requirements of the CQC. The Trust has published an uptodate register of interests for decisionmaking staff within the past 12 months, as required by the 'Managing Conflicts of Interest' in the NHS guidance.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/1968 697. Annual Quality Report The directors are required under the Health Act 2009 and the National Health Service (Quality Accounts) Regulations 2010 (as amended) to prepare Quality Reports for each financial year. NHS Improvement issued guidance to NHS foundation trusts on the form and content of Annual Quality Reports, which incorporate the above legal requirements in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual. The Board of Directors of The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust is assured that the Quality Report presents a balanced view and that there are appropriate controls in place to ensure the accuracy of data. The Quality Report is discussed throughout the year at monthly Board of Director meetings and at the QAR SubCommittee, with input from a wide range of stakeholders throughout the year including: - The NHS Foundation Trust Board of Directors - The Council of Governors - The Executive Board - Clinical Advisory Group - The Patient and Carer Advisory Group - Frontline staff/staff open meetings - The Trust Consultative Committee - Local Healthwatch - Local and specialist commissioners - Health and Wellbeing Boards.All the improvement priorities since 2009/10 have been identified and endorsed by members of the stakeholder groups (above). Members of the stakeholder groups have also reviewed progress on achievements over the last two years and ensured that the Trust has realistic but stretching improvement targets. Since 2012/13, local commissioners have been invited to review and add their critique and support to targets for Sutton Community Services. Every year the Trust holds patient and public involvement events, which include members of Healthwatch, social services, the public and patients to discuss and advise on priorities for inclusion in the Quality Report. The data presented in the Quality Report are generated by either the Information Team or external bodies such as the Health Protection Agency, who are independent of the operational and clinical teams in the Trust. Finally, the Trust's external auditors undertook sample data testing of Referral to Treatment within 18 weeks (incomplete pathways), cancer treatments started within 62 days of urgent GP referral, outpatient clinic waiting times and the rates of clostridium difficile infection.5. Review of economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of resources As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control to ensure that resources are used economically, efficiently and effectively. The Trust has established arrangements for managing its financial and other resources, which demonstrate that value for money is being managed and achieved. The annual budget setting process and plan for 2018/19 was approved by the Board of Directors and communicated to all managers in the organisation. The plan was to deliver a revenue surplus in 2018/19 and have an ongoing plan to improve organisational efficiency. The Chief Financial Officer and team have worked closely with divisional and corporate managers throughout the year to ensure the plan was delivered. The Trust overachieved on this plan in year to deliver a surplus of \u00a364.6 million. Included within this surplus the Trust received Provider Sustainability Funding of \u00a340.5 million, of which \u00a32.6 million was core and \u00a337.8 million was incentive funding. The Board has overseen the financial and operational performance of the Trust throughout the year. The AFC reviews performance against the financial plan and efficiency programme on a regular basis. Internal Audit undertakes audits each year, which they report to AFC, and these include the review of efficiency and use of resources across a range of expenditure types. In addition to financially related audits, the internal audit programme covers governance and risk issues. The Performance Review Group, chaired by the Chief Operating Officer, meets monthly and reviews the financial performance of each division, including the delivery of the efficiency programme. A Transformation Board was established in 2015 to manage a programme of strategic initiatives designed to improve the patient experience and organisational efficiency. This group also regularly reviews the outputs of the Model Hospital and Getting It Right First Time (GIRFT) visits to ensure the Trust meets best practice standards.During the year the Trust also: - Dynamically reviewed staff efficiency via the temporary staffing group and performance review group - Developed new models of care for inpatients, ambulatory care patients, as well as modernising medical seven day staffing and pathology systems via its transformation programme. These workstreams will continue into 2019/20 - Supported safe and sustainable pharmacy and aseptic transformation programmes, which have included a rebuild and redesign of services at the Chelsea site - Utilised benchmarking evidence from collaborative site visits, national tools such as the Model Hospital, and external professional reviews (such as catering) to inform future transformation and efficiency programmes - Worked across the health system to identify new ways of working and collaboration with partners - for example, to improve access and outcomes. 6. Information governance The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust achieved compliance with the Data Security and Protection Toolkit. This was achieved by submitting evidence for all mandatory questions in their final toolkit score for March 2019 and was therefore deemed compliant. The Trust has not had any enforcement notices or undertakings within the last financial year. The Trust reported two incidents in 2018/19 via the Data Security and Protection Toolkit. The first incident related to loss of data by the Trust's offsite storage company and the second incident related to the theft of encrypted hardware from offices; neither incidents met the requirement for reporting to the Information Commissioners Office (ICO).The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/1970 71The process that has been applied in maintaining and reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control has been reviewed by: - The Board of Directors; through consideration of key objectives and the management of principal risks to those objectives within the Board Assurance Framework - The Integrated Governance and Risk Management Committee; by reviewing all policies relating to governance and risk management, and monitoring the implementation of arrangements within the Trust - The Audit and Finance Committee; by reviewing and monitoring the opinions and reports provided by both internal and external audit - The Quality, Assurance and Risk Management Committee; by implementing and reviewing clinical governance and risk management arrangements and receiving reports from all operational risk committees - External assessments of services. Conclusion As Accounting Officer, and based on the review process detailed above, I am assured that there are no significant internal control issues. Approval of the Annual Governance Statement: Cally Palmer CBE Chief Executive 23 May 2019 Approval of the Accountability Report: Cally Palmer CBE Chief Executive 23 May 2019 8. Review of effectiveness As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control. My review is informed by the work of internal auditors, clinical auditors and the executive directors and clinical leads within the NHS Foundation Trust, who have responsibility for the development and maintenance of the internal control framework. I have drawn on the information provided in this annual report and other performance information available to me. My review is also informed by comments made by the external auditors in their management letter and other reports. I have been advised on the implications of the result of my review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control by the Board, Audit and Finance Committee, and Quality, Assurance and Risk Committee, and Integrated Governance and Risk Committee, and ensure continuous improvement of the system is in place. The Board Assurance Framework provides me with evidence that the effectiveness of controls to manage strategic risks to the organisation and that achieving its principal objectives have been reviewed and monitored.My review is also informed by: - Assessment of financial reports submitted to NHS Improvement, the Independent Regulator of NHS Foundation Trusts - The Board Development Framework and review of its performance in light of the 'well led' guidance issued by NHS Improvement - Opinions and reports made by external auditors - Opinions and reports made by internal auditors - Opinions and reports made by clinical auditors - Achievement of the Customer Service Excellence standard - Announced CQC inspections - NHS London Annual Emergency planning assurance process - ISO 9001 compliance for radiotherapy and chemotherapy - Clinical Pathology Accreditation (CPA) held for designated pathology services - UKAS Imaging Services Accreditation Scheme (new in November 2017) for Radiology Imaging Services - Quarterly Integrated Governance monitoring reports - Infection Control Annual Report - Clinical audit reports and action plans - Investigation reports and action plans following serious and significant incidents - Departmental and clinical risk assessments and action plans - Results of the national patient surveys - Results of the national Staff Survey.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/1972 73What is a Quality Report? All NHS Trusts have to publish their annual financial accounts. Since 2009, as part of the drive across the NHS to be open and honest about the quality of services provided to the public, all NHS Trusts have had to publish a Quality Report. You can also find information on the quality of services across NHS organisations by viewing the Quality Reports on the NHS Choices website at www.nhs.uk. The purpose of this Quality Report is to: 1. Summarise our performance and improvements against the quality priorities and objectives we set ourselves for 2018/19 2. Set out our quality priorities and objectives for 2019/20. Review of 2018/19 Qual ity info rmationSet out priorities Qual ity im provement 2019/20 Look ba ck Look fo rward To begin with, we will give details of how we performed in 2018/19 against the quality priorities and objectives we set ourselves under the categories of: Safe care Effective care Patient experience Where we have not met the priorities and objectives we set ourselves, we will explain why, and set out the plans we have to make sure improvements are made in the future. Secondly, we will set out our quality priorities and objectives for 2019/20, under these same categories. We will explain how we decided on these priorities and objectives, and how we aim to achieve these and measure performance.3. Quality Report What is a Quality Report?

The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust is the largest cancer centre in Europe and, in association with the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR), is responsible for the largest cancer research programme in the UK. Our commitment to meeting the challenges of continuing to provide quality care and experience within a costeffective framework underpins the following four corporate objectives for 2018/19: 1. Improve patient safety and clinical effectiveness 2. Improve patient experience 3. Deliver excellence in teaching and research 4. Ensure financial and environmental sustainability. Our commitment to improving quality is demonstrated by the following achievements in the year from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019. FiveYear Strategic Plan 2018/19 to 2023/24 Launched in June 2018, the Trust's FiveYear Strategic Plan outlines four core themes: 1. Research and innovation 2. Treatment and care 3. Modernising infrastructure 4. Financial sustainability and best value. There are also four crosscutting themes: workforce, quality, The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity and Private Care.Care Quality Commission inspection The Care Quality Commission (CQC) carried out an unannounced inspection at the Sutton site and in community services in May 2018. The 'well led' inspection was held in July 2018. As part of the CQC's new monitoring schedule, the inspector met junior and senior staff from a range of areas, visiting a different site each quarter. The inspection report, published in September 2018, rated the Trust as 'outstanding' overall and 'outstanding' for the new well led inspection. JACIE inspection The Joint Accreditation Committee of the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) and the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) (known as JACIE) promotes highquality patient care and laboratory performance in stem cell collection, processing and transplant centres through voluntary accreditation. The Royal Marsden received full JACIE accreditation in 2009 as a facility for transplanting, collecting and processing stem cells. The Royal Marsden offers a full service, with cells being transplanted to patients with a range of bloodbased cancers. Patients may have their own cells transplanted or may receive cells from a suitable donor taken from either blood or bone marrow. The Royal Marsden offers this treatment to both adults and children. In 2017, the stem cell transplant service carried out 217 transplants and underwent a full JACIE inspection in November 2017. The report from the inspection team was received in February 2018. The report recognised improvements since the previous inspection, with a number of aspects of the service being highly praised. It concluded that: \"The overall impression given was of an excellent transplant service with highly motivated and dedicated staff committed to providing highquality care.\"Quality Reports are useful for our Board, who are responsible for the quality of our services, as they can use them in their role of assessing and leading the Trust. We encourage frontline staff to use the Quality Report, both to compare their performance with other trusts, and also to help improve their own service. For patients, carers and the public, this Quality Report should be easy to read and understand. It should highlight important areas of safety and effective care being provided in a caring and compassionate way, and also show how we are concentrating on improvements we can make to patient care and experience. It is important to remember that some aspects of this Quality Report are compulsory. They are about significant areas, and are usually presented as numbers in a table. If there are any areas of the Quality Report that are difficult to read or understand, or if you have any questions, please contact us through the Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) by phoning 0800 783 7176, or visit our website at www.royalmarsden.nhs.uk. This Quality Report is divided into three sections: Part 1 Introduction to The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust and a statement on quality from the Chief Executive Part 2 Performance against 2018/19 quality priorities and setting our quality priorities for 2019/20 Reviewing progress of the quality improvements in 2018/19 and choosing the new priorities for 2019/20 Statements of assurance from the Board Part 3 Other informationThe Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/1976 77Customer Service Excellence The Customer Service Excellence standard tests in depth those areas that research has indicated are a priority for customers, with a particular focus on delivery, timeliness, information, professionalism and staff attitude. The Trust is assessed annually against a third of the standard. The latest assessment was held on Tuesday 2 April 2019 when the assessor visited the Sutton site. The Trust was deemed compliant across all elements of the standard bar one, which was graded as partially compliant due to the need to develop more challenging and stretching targets to further enhance customer satisfaction (experience) across services. The Trust has been assessed with Compliance Plus for 12 of the 57 elements of the standard. The Royal Marsden and its Board has tried to take all reasonable steps to make sure the information in this Quality Report is accurate. On behalf of the Board of The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust (the Trust) I can confirm that, as far as I know and believe, the information in this quality report is accurate. Cally Palmer CBE Chief Executive 23 May 2019 The inspection team did identify a number of areas for further improvements, which included a requirement to improve the facilities within the Stem Cell Transplant Laboratory to better segregate laboratory, office and storage areas. This was recognised by the Trust and extensive plans are now being implemented to address both the findings of the inspection report and also to greatly improve the clean room facilities. This led to a delay in receiving full reaccreditation, but the Trust is pleased to report that all aspects of the service have now been judged to be compliant to the JACIE standard (v7.0) and reaccreditation has been confirmed. ISO accreditation Radiotherapy treatment of patients requires a strongly integrated multidisciplinary team. There needs to be both flexibility in approach and robustness of timelines and delivery in order to give the best available treatments to our patients. To provide evidence that we comply with a consistently highquality standard, we are regularly (biannually) inspected by external assessors from the British Standards Institute (BSI). The evaluation contributes to our evidence for the CQC and badges the excellence of our service to patients and our collaborative workforce. The standard covers the following scope: \"The provision of assessment of patients, prescription planning and delivery of radiotherapy including external beam, and brachytherapy, technical support and administration.\" Our most recent inspection took place in early March 2019 and no nonconformances were found. As a result, Radiotherapy, Physics and Oncology have been awarded a Certificate of Registration (Quality Management System - ISO 9001:2015) for the 22nd consecutive year.UKAS accreditation The Estates Department is one of the UK Accreditation Service's accredited ISO 9001:2015 departments within the Trust. In February 2019 the department was reaudited on its: -ability to ensure applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements are met -effectiveness to ensure the client can reasonably expect to achieve specified objectives -ability to identify applicable areas for potential improvement. The inspection team identified a few improvement opportunities, which are now being addressed, but concluded that: \"The Estates Department provide a high level of service to the various client departments at the two sites... with a high degree of involvement of senior management with a whole host of evidence to demonstrate initiatives and improvements were being undertaken.\" Food and nutrition We have adopted the Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) framework on NHS staff health and wellbeing to support the improvement of our food environment. Putting the CQUIN into practice is a balance between meeting the nutritional needs of staff and visitors, and being able to provide the higher protein and energy choices that some patients need. In line with this, in 2018/19 we agreed with commissioners on the following targets: -90 per cent of drinks sold are reduced sugar or sugarfree (less than 5g of sugar per 100ml) -60 per cent of confectionery does not contain more than 250 kcals -50 per cent of sandwiches available contain less than 400 kcals. We have both met and exceeded these agreed targets. We have also retained the Soil Association's Food for Life certification, having achieved a silver award for our patient catering and bronze award for our staff and visitors dining. Further details of what is involved and the benefits of gaining these awards can be viewed at www.soilassociation.org.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/1978 79 CategoryQuality priority Target for 2018/19Performance for the year 2018/19Target set for April 2019 to March 2020 Safe care3 To maintain the percentage of admitted patients assessed for the risk of venous thromboembolism (getting a blood clot in a vein).a.

The priorities and targets in blue are reported by all NHS trusts as part of the Single Oversight Framework (https://improvement.nhs.uk/resources/singleoversightframework/). We recognise their importance and so incorporate them within our quality priorities. The priorities and targets in black are the ones we have set ourselves. These have been discussed and agreed throughout the year with both internal and external stakeholders, and you can find further details of this from page 83. Our performance against the targets is summarised in the table below. The table also shows which quality priorities we have set ourselves for 2019/20.

The next section gives more detail of the quality priorities, the progress we made in meeting the targets set for 2018/19, how we will improve our performance, and how our performance will be monitored and measured.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/1984 85Priority 2 To maintain or increase the number of reported patient safety incidents and near misses, while reducing the rate and percentage of patient safety incidents resulting in severe harm or death This applies to patients at The Royal Marsden and patients of Sutton Community Healthcare Services. Target For the rate of reported patient safety incidents that have caused severe harm or death to be below 0.06 per 1,000 bed days. (In 2017/18, the rate of severe harm or death from incidents per 1,000 bed days was zero for hospital and zero for community services.) \"We are proud that we are one of the highest performing trusts in the recent Staff Survey for staff feeling they are treated fairly when they report an incident or near miss. This is very important in supporting a culture of openness so we can learn from incidents.\" Chris Lafferty Deputy Head of Risk ManagementWhat we did in 2018/19 -We have furthered our collaboration with The Christie NHS Foundation Trust and Clatterbridge Cancer Centre NHS Foundation Trust to look at further ways of reducing E. coli bacteraemia in oncology patients -The Darzi fellow (a oneyear post intended to develop systems leadership) has commenced in post and the project is progressing well. An enhanced dataset is gathering intelligence around risk factors and will provide important information on risk, which the Darzi fellow will use to develop tools to promote best care -We have reviewed our surgical site infection (SSI) processes and are deploying a new system in collaboration with the Royal Brompton in 2019/2020 -We have purchased new commodes across the Trust and are replacing old bedpan washers with macerators -We have reviewed and updated local policies relating to hand hygiene and environmental cleaning. How we performed in 2018/19 -We achieved the first target and there have been no new cases of MRSA bacteraemia this year to date. The last case was a contaminant in 2016 -We have achieved our second target, whereby out of the total of 42 cases of C. difficile, six of these cases have been deemed as a lapse in care -We have achieved our third target and furthered our collaboration with The Christie NHS Foundation Trust and Clatterbridge Cancer Centre NHS Foundation Trust. This also includes the development of a collaborative work group to look at ways of reducing E. coli bacteraemia in oncology patients, which will be taken forward in our quality priorities for 2019/20. Actions to improve our performance -We continuously review and improve our audit data collection and reporting -We are developing a business case to provide an enhanced infection prevention service, which will include an additional microbiologist and nursing support -We will continue to undertake two antimicrobial ward rounds on each site every week to improve antimicrobial prescribing and overall stewardship. How improvements will be measured and monitored -Ward staff will carry out audits for hand hygiene and results will be fed back to staff -The 'SureWash' hand hygiene machine will capture data on staff competence with hand hygiene technique and their general infection prevention knowledge through a questionnaire -Departments will be audited to look at clinical practice. These audits will focus on isolating all infected patients, taking care of devices inserted under the skin and the patient environment. Feedback will be given to the relevant department to improve practice -Key infections, including C. difficile, E. coli bacteraemia and S. aureus bacteraemia, are subject to a clinical review process whereby patient notes are reviewed with clinicians to identify ways to improve care for future patients -Data on infections are reviewed at team meetings and by the Infection Prevention and Control Committee. The annual Infection Prevention and Control Report 2017/18 was shared with the Integrated Governance and Risk Management (IGRM) Committee and the Clinical Quality Review Group (CQRG) committees in July 2018.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/1986 87Priority 3 To maintain the percentage of admitted patients assessed for the risk of venous thromboembolism (getting a blood clot in a vein) Targets a. For the percentage of patients who have been assessed to remain above 95 per cent. b. For those patients assessed as high risk, appropriate treatment is started. \"We are now using the quality and safety boards on all wards to highlight risk and raise awareness. Venous thromboembolism assessments are included and discussed at the ward huddles.\" Ann Duncan Matron Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a single term for both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). A DVT is a blood clot that forms in a deep vein (usually in the leg). If a clot breaks off and travels to the arteries of the lung, it causes a PE, which can be lifethreatening. VTE can be avoided by giving preventive treatment (prophylaxis) to patients at risk. Patients with cancer are at greater risk of developing VTE; therefore this continues to be a safety priority for us.What we did in 2018/19 -All staff who reported an incident received individual feedback once we received details of the incident and the outcome of the investigation -Incident reports on significant events were passed to the IGRM Committee and then used widely across the Trust to help with learning -Examples of incidents were shared during training, and themes and trends of incidents were discussed at the weekly senior nurses meeting -We continued to produce our monthly patient safety bulletin, 'Big 4' (B4), from the Chief Nurse, Medical Director and Chief Pharmacist. B4 details four key safety messages each month, as well as a 'good safety catch' by a member of staff. B4 also helps to support local shift safety briefings, local quality huddles and team meetings -We reported all patient safety incidents that we were responsible for to the National Reporting and Learning Service (NRLS). How we performed in 2018/19 -We have achieved our target for both the hospital and community services, with a rate of zero per cent for the community and 0.048 per cent for the hospital. Comparison with national figures The NRLS reports that for the period from October 2017 to March 2018, there were no incidents resulting in severe harm or death. A further four out of the 17 acute specialist trusts reported results in line with ours. This was the latest information available when this document was produced. Actions to improve our performance Keeping to regulation 20 - The Duty of Candour This is a regulation to make sure that we are open and honest about care and treatment. Under regulation 20, if there is a patient safety incident that is graded moderate harm or above, we must follow a set process. You can find full details on the website at: www.cqc.org.uk/guidanceproviders/ regulationsenforcement/regulation20dutycandour. Our Being Open and Duty of Candour Policy incorporates the requirements of the Duty of Candour. To make sure that we are open and honest about incidents that fall under regulation 20, the risk management team reviews every reported incident that is graded moderate harm and above. The review starts on either the day that the incident is reported, or the next working day. If the incident is confirmed as being correctly graded as moderate harm or above, the risk management team works with the relevant clinical staff to make sure the patient is told about the incident, and that an appropriate apology is given within ten days of the incident being reported on the incident reporting system. The patient is kept informed of our investigation. If a report is being produced, the patient is asked if they would like to receive a copy of it. The risk management team follows up to make sure that the report is sent to the patient, along with an offer to meet them to go through the findings. The Duty of Candour process is monitored every six months by an audit, and the results are given to the IGRM Committee, the Quality, Assurance and Risk (QAR) Committee, and the Trust Board Committee. The audits have identified that an area that requires improvement is making sure that patients and their relatives receive a copy of the final report if they would like one. In order to address this, the risk management team is taking on more responsibility in the final part of the process. How improvements will be measured and monitored -We will continue to undertake sixmonthly Duty of Candour audits -We will conduct an annual audit of risk management and incident reporting processes -We will analyse the results of the Staff Survey.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/1988 89Priority 4 To reduce the incidence of emergency readmissions to hospital within 28 days of patients being discharged Target For the number of avoidable readmissions to be below 0.2 per cent. \"Patients with cancer can have complex problems related to the disease, its treatment or comorbidities. This is why we have developed an acute oncology service in which patients are assessed by a consultant oncologist when they first present as an emergency. In addition, we have also developed an acute oncology ambulatory unit to help avoid unnecessary admissions. This approach ensures our patients receive safe and effective care.\" Dr Nadia Yousaf Consultant Medical Oncologist and Clinical Lead for the Acute Oncology Service Since 2012/13, Quality Reports should show the percentage of patients of all ages and genders who were readmitted within 28 days of being discharged, and the national average (see Appendix 3 for more details about the national average). It is important to note that some readmissions will include patients who are admitted because of the side effects of treatment, so it may be difficult to explain any differences between us and other NHS trusts.What we did in 2018/19 -We introduced the requirement that all inpatients should receive an assessment for the risk of VTE on admission to a ward and within 24 hours -All fields on the electronic risk assessment are now mandatory -We have updated the inpatient drug chart in line with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance to ensure thrombosis and bleeding risk is documented appropriately and where 24hour reassessment is no longer a requirement -The VTE policy has been updated and communicated to all staff -An audit was carried out by one of our lead pharmacists to establish future actions required to ensure that all assessments for the risk of VTE are recorded appropriately. How we performed in 2018/19 -We achieved the target of ensuring that 95 per cent of our patients are assessed for the risk of developing VTE. An average of 95.23 per cent of patients were assessed for the risk of VTE from April 2018 to March 2019 -Of those patients deemed high risk, 100 per cent received timely and appropriate treatment. Actions to improve our performance -We will streamline the assessment process to ensure that it is electronic only -We will ensure that the dose banding on the drug chart now matches the assessment on the Electronic Patient Record (EPR) to maintain a consistent approach. How improvements will be measured and monitored -Risk assessment data will continue to be reported and reviewed monthly -We will continue to maintain our target for the percentage of patients assessed to be over 95 per cent -The VTE working group will monitor progress, and review the monthly data and action plan accordingly.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/1990 91Priority 5 To reduce the incidence of category 3 pressure ulcers (fullthickness skin loss) and category 4 pressure ulcers (fullthickness tissue loss) developing in patients while they are receiving community care or hospital care Targets a. For the percentage of category 3 and category 4 pressure ulcers arising in patients receiving community care or hospital care to be less than 0.15 per cent. b. For 90 per cent of category 3 and category 4 pressure ulcers, both already existing and developing while receiving community care to have healed or improved to category 1 (redness of intact skin, which does not fade when pressed) or category 2 (partialthickness skin loss or blister) within three months. \"We continue to strive to reduce hospital acquired pressure ulcers by implementing and embedding the latest best practice guidelines and looking at new ways of working.\" Jenni MacDonald Lead Nurse, Harm Free Care and Tissue ViabilityWhat we did in 2018/19 -Our Acute Oncology Service (AOS) continued to provide a consultantdelivered service for emergency oncology admissions at The Royal Marsden -This service is supported by The Royal Marsden Macmillan Hotline, a specialist oncology advice line for patients undergoing cancer treatment. How we performed in 2018/19 -We achieved our target of having less than 0.2 per cent of emergency readmissions to hospital within 28 days of discharge, with the overall percentage for 2018/19 being 0.15 per cent. This percentage is below the national average and below our target of 0.2 per cent. It is also lower than the percentage achieved in 2017/18 of 0.21 per cent. Table 2 shows the number and percentage of patients who were readmitted within 28 days from April 2018 to March 2019 -The small number of readmissions were unavoidable and a consequence of the cancer or treatment. However, some could be avoided by making sure that patients receive: -the best possible treatment according to their needs -careful planning and support for caring for themselves when they leave hospital. Table 2: Number of patients who were readmitted within 28 days of discharge from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 Month Number of patients readmitted within 28 daysPercentage of patients readmitted within 28 days April 2018 7 0.16% May 2018 7 0.14% June 2018 7 0.15% July 2018 4 0.08% August 2018 10 0.21% September 2018 6 0.13% October 2018 10 0.20% November 2018 8 0.16% December 2018 6 0.13% January 2019 7 0.14% February 2019 10 0.22% March 2019 2 0.04% Total 84 0.15% Actions to improve our performance -We are introducing the acute oncology outofhours admission prioritisation guide, and updating the access policy -The AOS team will use the national scoring system to identify patients at risk of developing sepsis and will bring these patients back as day cases to review -We are reviewing the introduction of telephone triaging to provide additional support to patients and to reduce anxiety. How improvements will be measured and monitored -The AOS team will continue to review any unplanned inpatient admissions. This includes a review by a consultant within 14 hours of admission.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/1992 93Actions to improve our performance -We will implement an elearning pressure ulcer module -We will revise the hospital pressure ulcer policy in line with recent NHS Improvement guidelines and more ambitious key performance indicators (KPIs) -Mini RCAs for all category 2 pressure ulcers will be undertaken -Standard foam mattresses will be replaced with more advanced hybrid mattresses where required, and we will monitor the use of the equipment selection guide -We will take part in the first national pressure ulcer and quality audit -We will review the discharge documentation for patients with pressure ulcers with the aim of improving where required -We are developing a new wound assessment chart that will be piloted with staff -We will continue to monitor and follow up on actions as a result of RCAs. How improvements are measured and monitored -We will undertake an annual pressure ulcer prevalence and quality audit, which will build upon the previous year's audit, and will act upon any learning -Monthly audits will continue, to ensure that the pressure ulcer bundles are being used appropriately -We will continue to analyse pressure ulcer incidents to aid specific developments in identifying risk factors and preventive measures for patients with cancer. The use of the mini RCAs for category 2 pressure ulcers will be monitored to develop strategies to further reduce incidents -We will continue to report on and monitor pressure ulcers in our monthly Quality Report. As of 1 April 2019, The Royal Marsden is no longer commissioned to provide community care. However, recommendations have been communicated to the new service providers to include audits, mini RCAs and monitoring through monthly reporting.What we did in 2018/19 -We have revised and republished independent hospital and community policies -We have embedded the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) 2014 guidelines, which include all six categories of pressure ulcers -We have undertaken a prevalence and quality audit -We held a 'pressure ulcer mock coroner's court', which -We held a 'Stop the pressure' event (NHS Improvement campaign to improve the standards of safe care) -We have introduced mini root cause analyses (RCAs), a method of identifying the root cause of a problem, for category 2 and deep tissue injury pressure ulcers -We have introduced a new bedside tool 'ASSKING' (Assess risk, Skin inspection, Surface, Keep moving, Incontinence, Nutrition, Giving information) bundle, in collaboration with patient representatives -An internal tissue viability champion role was launched with dedicated internal staff training -A new pressure ulcer information leaflet for patients was published -All staff received regular training in pressure ulcer management and we have introduced a competency for new staff to achieve -A new Tissue Viability Nurse is in post to help and support staff, as well as assess and advise on grade 3 and 4 pressure ulcers. How we performed in 2018/19 -We achieved our first target of less than 0.15 per cent of patients developing category 3 and category 4 pressure ulcers that were attributed to us while under the care of the hospital. We did not meet this target for patients under the care of community services. The hospital reported an overall percentage of 0.11 per cent and the community reported 0.29 per cent -In the hospital, we had one category 4 and six category 3 pressure ulcers. This is slightly higher than last year and no trends have been identified. We have learnt from these incidents and made changes to tissue viability services, education and medical devices -In the community we had one attributable category 4 pressure ulcer and 5 attributable category 3 pressure ulcers -We achieved our target of 100 per cent of category 3 and category 4 pressure ulcers acquired by patients receiving care from community services reported to have healed within three months unless the underlying medical complexities made healing impossible, or where patients were receiving endoflife care -There has been an increased awareness of prevention, identification and treatment in the hospital, demonstrated in the 46 per cent increase in reporting of incidents on the Trust's electronic reporting system -94 per cent of attendees at the pressure ulcer mock coroner's court reported that the event positively changed their practice -All category 3 and 4 pressure ulcers were discussed at pressure ulcer panels.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/1994 95What we did in 2018/19 We have invested in a new sepsis lead nurse post to support the delivery of the CQUIN for 2018/19 and the wider sepsis and acute kidney injury (AKI) agenda. We have also invested in the pharmacy team and consultant lead to support the antimicrobial elements of the CQUIN. Please note the Trust has now agreed to recurrently fund the posts going forward. As a result of the appointment of the sepsis nurse, significant progress has been made not only within the CQUIN but also the wider sepsis agenda, including; -The drug chart is being amended to include antimicrobial review as a prompt -Video and screenshot teaching is now available for junior doctors -The sepsis nurses, antimicrobial pharmacists and consultant lead continue to promote carrying out reviews between 24 and 72 hours (including the critical care unit) to junior doctors and advanced nurse practitioners (ANPs) -The sepsis policy has been updated and is going through the Antimicrobial Steering Committee and the Nursing, Radiography and Rehabilitation Committee (NRRAC) for ratification. Following this, it will be published on the intranet -A Patient Group Direction for sepsis has been created. This allows some registered health professionals to supply and/or administer specified medicines to a predefined group of patients, without them having to see a prescriber (such as a doctor or nurse prescriber) -The vascular access lead is investigating ultrasound technology for cannulation -Sepsis trolleys (including everything needed to treat sepsis and neutropenic sepsis) are now in use in the outpatient departments at The Royal Marsden's hospitals in Chelsea and Sutton -The Sepsis/Situation Background Assessment Recommendation (SBAR) tool has been rolled out across both sites, with daily teaching in all clinical areas. The four letters of SBAR indicate the Situation (problem being discussed), Background (the medical history of the patient and treatment to date), Assessment (of the patient) and Recommendation (of the person leading the discussion) -The sepsis nurses have embedded the key sepsis and National Early Warning Score (NEWS) training into the Basic Life Support teaching session held at induction and mandatory training -Nurse sepsis training was carried out across the Trust. There were seven workshops held with 80 successful attendees who can now give Patient Group Directions. Sepsis workshops were also arranged for senior nursing staff -Discussions have been held with the paediatrics department regarding the sepsis screening tool and updating Paediatric Early Warning Score (PEWS). A paediatric sepsis meeting was also held on 31 October 2018, including the consultant sepsis lead, Matron, ward sisters, ANPs and practice educators -Sepsis posters have been developed for all clinical areas to guide recognition and treatment -The monthly sepsis CQUIN programme board continues to meet, with strong representation from medical, nursing, pharmacy and performance staff, and is now chaired by the sepsis nurses. In addition to the above, ongoing work is taking place across the Trust to promote antimicrobial stewardship and good practice.Priority 6 To reduce harm from sepsis: a) to increase the number of patients screened for sepsis; b) to give antibiotics within one hour of patients being diagnosed with sepsis; c) to make sure patients receive an antibiotic review between 24 and 72 hours after commencement of antibiotics for sepsis Applies to hospital inpatients going to the Clinical Assessment Unit (CAU). Targets a. For more than 90 per cent of patients who meet the local criteria for suspected sepsis to be screened for sepsis. b. For more than 90 per cent of patients to be given antibiotics within one hour of sepsis being diagnosed. c. For more than 90 per cent of patients to receive an antibiotic review between 24 and 72 hours after commencement of antibiotics for sepsis. \"Patients with cancer are at a higher risk of developing infections. This is especially true of those receiving systemic anticancer therapy, as well as those patients undergoing major surgery. We are pursuing Trustwide efforts to prevent, rapidly identify and treat sepsis, whilst minimising unnecessary antimicrobial usage.\" Vimal Grover Consultant in Critical Care and Anaesthesia, and Sepsis Lead for The Royal Marsden Patients with cancer are at risk of developing infections. Preventing sepsis, together with identifying and treating cases early, can improve outcomes for patients. Minimising harm associated with sepsis is one of our priorities, and we joined the national 'Sign up to Safety' programme in 2015 (see Appendix 5).The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/1996 97Actions to improve our performance -We will continue to undertake staff training programmes and review the drug charts -We will encourage the use of the EPR sepsis and antimicrobial stewardship tools, as well as completion of the antibiotic review box on the drug chart -The multidisciplinary antimicrobial stewardship ward rounds that are conducted twice weekly on both sites will continue -We are considering further opportunities to embed sepsis training; for example an elearning module -As gaining venous access can be challenging, we will improve training for cannulation/venepuncture -The sepsis nurse will continue to support the antimicrobial stewardship ward round including: -Supporting bedside nurses with practical advice to improve patient care, for example, diagnostic stewardship, when to remove central lines and when to make chest physiotherapy referrals -We will continue to improve awareness of prescribing best practice, stop dates and indication for prescribing -As the sepsis nurse can prescribe, they can therefore change prescriptions at the time of the ward round and liaise with the nurse to avoid delay and misunderstandings. How improvements will be measured and monitored Quarterly audits will be carried out to measure compliance against the following two contractual KPIs during 2019/20, as agreed with commissioners: -Percentage of patients who meet the local criteria for suspecting sepsis to be screened for sepsis -Percentage of patients to be given antibiotics within one hour of sepsis being diagnosed -The vascular access lead is investigating ultrasound technology for cannulation.Antimicrobial stewardship ward rounds with a microbiology consultant, antimicrobial pharmacist and sepsis nurse have been taking place on all wards at both the Chelsea and Sutton sites, twice weekly. Every patient who is prescribed an antibiotic is reviewed during this ward round by the multidisciplinary team and the outcome of the review is fed back to the clinical teams and ward pharmacists. The sepsis nurse role is now embedded within the antimicrobial stewardship ward round to clinically review patients, advise the team to address concerns, communicate advice to the patient and support nurses, as well as prescribe and deprescribe medication. The antimicrobial prescribing policy was discussed at the Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) in January 2019 to promote stewardship to clinical staff and consultants. Additionally, as part of world antimicrobial awareness week, our lead antimicrobial pharmacist conducted a series of events across the Trust to promote good practice. These included: -Hosting a stall at both the Chelsea and Sutton sites to promote awareness -Attending junior doctor meetings to share learning and good practice techniques -Conducting a ward tour at each site to observe and advise on current practice -Distribution of posters, leaflets and other media promoting awareness of good practice. How we performed in 2018/19 -A baseline audit was carried out in quarter 2, with the Trust's position against the three targets baselined and a trajectory proposed to commissioners -We achieved all targets and the results are set in the following table.

Once a week the forms are collected, and an external company processes the feedback and returns this to us -Improvement lists based on poor responses were circulated to individual wards and departments for action -We participated in the National Inpatient Survey -An action plan was implemented and monitored in response to the National Inpatient Survey. How we performed in 2018/19 NHS England displays the information that has been collected each month for 170 providers of NHSfunded services for inpatients and independentsector providers for inpatients, outpatients, community services, dental, ambulance, accident and emergency (A&E), maternity, mental health and GP services. There is information about the Friends and Family Test on the website at: www. england.nhs.uk/statistics/statisticalworkareas/friendsandfamilytest/. -We achieved our target of maintaining 95 per cent of inpatients saying that they would recommend us. The average for the year was 95.15 per cent of patients recommending us for care or treatment -The results of the National Inpatient Survey patient responses placed The Royal Marsden among the best performing trusts for the nine relevant sections (waiting list and admission; all types of admission; hospital and ward; doctors; nurses; care and treatment; operations and procedures; leaving hospital; and overall views of care and experience) -In the section for 'overall views of care and services', the Trust was very highly rated and obtained the second highest score of 9.12 (out of ten) for this section, close behind the highest score of 9.16 -Where we received low scores, an action plan was developed and actions implemented monitored through the Patient Experience Strategy Group. How improvements will be measured and monitored -We will continue to use the Friends and Family Test to get feedback from patients on how we can improve our services -We will review the questions on our survey and align them with our priorities around patient experience -We will look at alternative methods to paper surveys to collect feedback and improve the response rate for the Friends and Family Test -We will continue to monitor and implement actions following feedback received from the national surveys through our Patient Experience Strategy Group.Priority 7a To make sure that we are responding to inpatients' personal needs Target For our Friends and Family Test score for hospital inpatients to be more than 95 per cent. \"We are all committed to delivering excellent personalised cancer care. We continually review the feedback we receive with the aim of improving our services to ensure the optimal patient experience for everyone we treat and care for at The Royal Marsden.\" Natalie Doyle Nurse Consultant The Friends and Family Test was introduced in May 2012. Under this test, all NHS patients are asked whether they would recommend a particular healthcare setting to their friends and family. The results of this test are used to improve the experience of patients and to highlight priority areas for action. The question asked is: \"How likely are you to recommend this service to friends and family if they require similar care or treatment?\" The patients then choose their answer from the following: -Extremely likely -Likely -Neither know.The NHS Foundation Trust and Accounts 2018/19100 101What we did in 2018/19 -We continued to routinely ask patients receiving community services the Friends and Family Test question as part of our patient experience surveys -Since 1 April 2016, community services have used the same service provider as The Royal Marsden to gather feedback. This has streamlined the process of gathering, reviewing and acting on feedback -We have gathered feedback through paper surveys (written and picture, and easyread forms), online surveys and a mobile device app -Patient champions in each service have shared monthly feedback with their teams and encouraged staff to ask patients for feedback throughout the year. How we performed in 2018/19 We met the overall target set for 2018/19 in response to the question \"How likely are you to recommend this service to friends and family if they needed similar care or treatment?\" . During the year from April 2018 to March 2019, an average of 97 per cent would recommend our services to friends and family. Some examples of patient feedback comments are: Health visiting \"Every time I attend this clinic I feel valued. The service and information provided is personal and tailored to the baby and myself, thank you.\" Musculoskeletal (MSK) Assess and Treat \"Good medical care, efficient service, professional and willing to go the extra mile.\" Neurotherapy \"The activities and exercises were designed specifically for me. The flexibility of settings, e.g. coming to my home. The kindness and care given to me as an individual enabled me to grow in confidence and progress. Thank you very much.\" Early Supported Discharge Team \"I appreciated the promptness that the support started when I came from hospital (I was contacted the day after being discharged) and the frequency that my physiotherapist and occupational therapist were able to visit me. I also appreciated that they came to see me at home, as it would have been difficult for me to travel to see my therapist at that frequency. Both therapists were kind, friendly and respectful, and thorough in making sure I had understood everything and asking whether I had any other concerns.\" Actions to improve our performance As of 1 April 2019, The Royal Marsden is no longer commissioned to provide community services. However, recommendations have been communicated to the new service providers to include monthly monitoring of comments and feedback received by the team leaders, as well as monthly reporting at divisional meetings.Priority 7b To continue using the Friends and Family Test question for patients receiving community care Target For our Friends and Family Test score for community services to be more than 95 per cent. \"We are committed to delivering high quality care for all our patients in their home environment. We continually review the feedback we receive to improve our services and understand patients' needs to provide the very best experience of health care delivery.\" Eamonn Sullivan Chief Nurse The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19102 103What we did in 2018/19 Over the past 12 months, in response to the previous year's survey, we particularly focused on health and wellbeing, bullying and harassment, and staff working extra hours, with the particular actions below: -We launched the Red Tape Challenge, which aims to reduce the amount of nursing documentation -We launched a new network for staff with disabilities and health conditions -We continued to build on our health and wellbeing programmes to support staff, with a particular focus on mental health leading up to World Mental Health Day on 10 October 2018, including events in Chelsea and Sutton to launch two free apps for support staff -We launched the HALT (Hungry, Angry, Late, Tired) campaign, which will be rolled out across the Trust -We reduced the Trust staff vacancy rate from 11 to nine per cent -We recruited 250 nurses and reduced nursing vacancies from 15 to 11 per cent -We launched the fourth and fifth cohorts of the Paired Learning Programme -We expanded our leadership development programmes with the launch of the multiprofessional Academic Health Science Centre (AHSC) Leadership Development Programme and two nurse leadership programmes -We expanded our Career Mentoring Scheme to include staff in bands 1-7 -We held our first Excellence in Education conference in January 2018 -We introduced new career development opportunities through the Senior Healthcare Support Worker Apprenticeships -We appointed Freedom To Speak Up Champions for each division to enable staff to discuss their concerns safely and confidentially -We launched the Outstanding Care: Outstanding Culture sessions, which to date have been attended by over 200 staff to review our values and the behaviours that underpin positive staff experience. How we performed in 2018/19 Friends and Family Test Three times a year, we ask staff to respond to the Friends and Family Test question: \"How likely are you to recommend this organisation to friends and family if they needed care and treatment?\" . In all three surveys, over 95 per cent of staff said that they would recommend us, meaning that this target has been met. The number of staff responding to the Friends and Family Test during 2018/19 was similar to 2017/18. There were 503 responses during January to March 2019, compared with 553 responses during January to March 2018. This survey is not carried out in October to December as it coincides with the national NHS Staff Survey.Priority 8 To increase the percentage of staff who would recommend The Royal Marsden to friends or family needing care Target For more than 95 per cent of surveyed staff to say that they would recommend The Royal Marsden. The quotes below are samples from the anonymous comments staff provided. \"Patients are priority and the highest standard of care I have witnessed is given here.\" \"The patient care has been rated as outstanding by the CQC, which accurately reflects the service given here. People really matter, and this includes the staff as well as the patients.\" Each year during October to December we carry out the national Staff Survey, and this provides us with a wide range of information about what we do well and what we need to improve on. The survey asks staff how strongly they agree with the statement: \"If a friend or relative needed treatment, I would be happy with the standard of care provided by this trust.\" In 2018/19, an average of 95 per cent of staff either agreed or strongly agreed with the statement.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19104 105Actions to improve our performance -To ensure the refreshed values of The Royal Marsden are embedded into workforce processes (including recruitment, appraisal and employee relations), with the aim of embedding positive behaviours throughout and improving WRES findings. -To embed the Leadership Development programmes and Careers Advisory Service across the organisation, ensuring representative usage of these. -To ensure recruitment panel chairs have undertaken equality and diversity training and to explore opportunities for Diversity Champions to be part of recruitment panels. -To participate in the panLondon WRES indicator 3 project to reduce the number of BME staff who are disciplined compared to white staff across London. How improvements will be measured and monitored -Results from the Friends and Family Test and the annual Staff Survey will be analysed and reviewed by the Workforce and Education Committee, and a set of targeted actions will be agreed to support continuous improvement and increase the number of staff responding. -Results from the starters and leavers survey, and progression data, will be analysed to identify areas for continuous improvement. -All action plans will be regularly reviewed by the Workforce and Education Committee to chart progress.Workforce Race Equality Standard The Workforce Race Equality Standard (WRES) requires all NHS organisations to demonstrate how they are dealing with race equality issues in staffing areas such as recruiting, and promoting staff to improve the experiences of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) staff. The table below provides a breakdown of four of the WRES measures from the results of the yearly Staff Survey. Table 4: Staff survey results (2018 WRES findings) Indicator 2018 2017 Progress since 2015 1 % of staff in Agenda for Change bands and very senior manager levelsSimilar findings to 2017Similar findings to 2016 2 Likelihood of white staff being appointed from shortlisting2.08 times more likely2.42 times more likely 3 Likelihood of BAME staff entering formal disciplinary process2.01 times more likely2.25 times more likely 4 Likelihood of white staff accessing nonmandatory training and continuing professional development (CPD)0.95 times more likely1.00 times more likely 5 Experiencing harassment and bullying (patients, relatives or public)BME staff 14% BME staff 17% 6 Experiencing harassment and bullying (staff) BME staff 24% BME staff 28% 7 Believing Trust provides equal opportunities for career progression and promotionBME staff 78% BME staff 74% 8 Experiencing discrimination from leader or other colleaguesBME staff 9% BME staff 11% 9 % difference between Board voting membership and overall % of BAME staff in the workforce30.5% 28% Key Improvement Similar findings Deterioration During this year, improvements were noted for 72 per cent of Staff Survey findings for BAME staff and there was a three per cent increase in BAME staff in the workforce to 32 per cent, which is the most significant increase in workforce composition in any one year over the last four years. There was increased participation and membership of the Joint Forum for BAME staff from 27 in 2016 to over 100 in 2018, with a diverse range of events organised including a seminar with Yvonne Coghill, Director of WRES in the NHS. The Trust won the 'Best UK employer of the year' award at the 2018 Nursing Times Workforce Summit Awards, and the judges commented on how the Trust's presentation addressed equality and diversity, and that there is a \"genuine commitment to support staff across the organisation\".The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19106 107What we did in 2018/19 -The new Day Care Improvement Programme was started in May 2018 and covered both private and NHS care -An external quality consultant was brought in to review current pathways and support the identification of priorities and the development of work streams. -Representatives from all the day units and all staff groups related to ambulatory care were invited to a preliminary workshop -An initial work programme was developed based on the workshop and consultant feedback, covering the following work streams: who does what, workforce, bloods, scheduling/capacity, space and infrastructure, aseptics, and communication -The content of the work programme was prioritised based on deliverability, improvement to care, staff experience and financial impact -Leads for each work stream have been identified and are accountable to the Transformation Board, and work is in progress for each work stream. How we performed in 2018/19 -This year there has been no change in the overall percentage of patients waiting more than 30 minutes (Chelsea: ~50 per cent; Sutton: ~67 per cent) -Analysis has found a number of factors that contribute to delays, including late confirmation of prescribing chemotherapy, and unrealistic or late scheduling of appointment times -However, improvements were seen for a group of 'gold patients' included in a pilot scheme (see below). Batch chemotherapy pilot scheme (Medical Day Unit Sutton) Patients on suitable chemotherapy regimens were identified and booked into the first appointment slots of the day (gold patients). A named pharmacy technician was responsible for identifying these patients and ensuring that their chemotherapy was dispensed on the afternoon before treatment was due and sent up to the Medical Day Unit (MDU) that evening. For these gold patients, 92 per cent of chemotherapy was delivered to the MDU the evening before treatment or by 9am that day (compared to 85 per cent before the pilot), and the percentage of treatments delivered late reduced from 11 to two per cent. The pilot has since been repeated in Chelsea and we plan to roll it out to include batch chemotherapy scheduled for any time of day and private patient day units at both sites.Priority 9a To reduce waiting times at chemotherapy appointments and improve patients' experiences relating to waiting times Target For 90 per cent of patients to receive their chemotherapy on time. \"Reducing the time a patient waits for their chemotherapy will drastically improve the flow of patients in the day units and, more essentially, it will improve the overall experience for our patients. Often our patients are feeling unwell and travel some distance to attend for their treatment, and increasingly we have patients who are working or who have family commitments, and so keeping time spent in hospital to a minimum is a priority for them.\" Emma Foreman Consultant Pharmacist To understand and improve chemotherapy waiting times, it is important to analyse the reasons behind delayed treatment times because many factors are involved. It is evident that the demand for treatment has increased progressively. Although advances in drug development have enabled some treatments to be delivered on an outpatient basis, others have become more complex and time consuming to prepare and administer, which has meant that there has been a significant increase on the demands of the service. The Day Care Improvement Programme was established following an external review of the Trust's day care provision and following the quality improvement project work carried out in 2017 by the pharmacy aseptic team.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19108 109Priority 9b To reduce waiting times in outpatient clinics and improve patient experiences relating to waiting times Target For no more than five per cent of patients to have to wait more than one hour. \"We try to always keep our patients updated when clinic is running late, it's important to ensure that patients feel involved and up to date.\" Alyson Long Senior Staff Nurse for Outpatients Sutton Within our outpatient departments we aim to have excellent communication with our patients to make sure that they have a positive experience, particularly at their first appointment.Actions to improve our performance Via the work streams identified above, the following are currently being addressed: -A new blood bottle labellers and ID card printers have been procured for phlebotomy, to cut down the time taken labelling bottles and prevent rejected samples. The new system should be in place by the end of May 2019 -In the laboratories, biochemistry analyser replacement will allow faster turnaround times for blood test results, allowing for earlier confirmation of chemotherapy -We are developing an electronic scheduling system to streamline the system, monitor capacity and use chair time more efficiently. The system will be ready for testing in July 2019, with a view to carrying out staff training and system roll out in October 2019. We have reviewed our policy on allocating patients to onestop or to twostop appointments to reduce variance and optimise the use of twostop appointments -A workforce and role review on all MDUs was undertaken -We will review the aseptic unit workflow and optimisation of the use of premade (or 'batch') chemotherapy. How improvements will be measured and monitored -Metrics for each project are currently under review. Milestone reporting at intervals will assess and review progress -Patient feedback/satisfaction will be monitored via a patient satisfaction survey and a series of patient focus groups.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19110 111Actions to improve our performance -A business case has been approved to expand space in phlebotomy services and incorporate haematology bloods -An appointment reminder service is being implemented for March 2019. This will improve use of available capacity and support performance and waiting time targets -An improved outcome process is being embedded in outpatients departments and the RDAC. -We are undertaking testing of an online clinic room booking and monitoring system to support better utilisation and reporting -We are considering further extension of coordination to improve patient flow and organisation of increasingly busy clinics. How improvements will be measured and monitored -We will review feedback, including through the Friends and Family Test results, regarding waiting times to assess the overall experience for blood rooms across the sites -Improved utilisation figures across sites for the clinic -We will undertake monthly KPI monitoring with the aim of improving 'inclinic' waiting times despite an increase in referrals and attendances -Improvement in the figures of patients with the outcomes of their appointments recorded as well as any followup actions.What we did in 2018/19 -We reviewed the skill mix of nursing staff in Sutton to enhance appropriate cover in clinics -A trial is underway for automated blood labelling rather than hand writing blood labels -We successfully introduced outcome forms in our Rapid Diagnostic and Assessment Centre (RDAC) and outpatient clinics so that all patients have a clear next action in their pathway. This has led to an improvement in the levels of patients with clear outcomes after appointments -We proactively review clinic templates that are underutilised to ensure that the best use is made of space in the department to help patient flow -We have undertaken analysis on capacity and demand for clinics in preparation for the new Oak Centre for Children and Young People in Sutton -We have increased the numbers of coordinators in our clinics in Sutton and Chelsea to improve the flow of clinics -We moved peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) and port services in Sutton from the MDU into outpatients, to improve capacity and patient flow in the MDU. How we performed in 2018/19 Table 5 shows that we achieved our target of less than five per cent of patients waiting more than one hour for treatment from April 2018 to March 2019. Across the year, the average was two per cent. The number of patients waiting for more than one hour has been consistently at two per cent or less since September 2017. Table 5: Chelsea and Sutton waiting times from April 2018 to March 2019 Month Waiting time Less than 15 minutes Less than 30 minutes 30 to 60 minutes More than one hour April 2018 75% 15% 7% Trust Accounts 2018/19112 113What we did in 2018/19 -In September 2018, we scoped the services with a view to redesigning a sustainable clinic to maintain the target of seeing 80 per cent of patients within 20 days. This involved liaising with the team to determine what the challenges were, collecting data on demand versus capacity, and liaising with the senior members of the team, administration and the medical records lead to determine a workable solution to achieve the target -A new diary template was set up in November 2018. We also listened to the fact that patients wanted to see the same clinician for continuity of care, and this was factored into the new diary. Others factors that affected the demand were identified and a working solution will be implemented to address these -The staff skill mix was also reviewed to identify if this was optimal for the demand, and was subsequently changed -We successfully recruited one more staff member so we can meet service demands. How we performed in 2018/19 Table 6 shows the percentage of average wait days and percentage of patients offered an appointment within 20 working days by the podiatry service in 2018/19.

The performance for the first six months was variable, primarily due to the usual challenges that come with rolling out a new model -From October 2018 there has been a steady rise in the number seen within 20 days, as the model is established, with a small decline in November of 5.6 per cent. From January to March, the KPI was within the targetPriority 10a To reduce waiting times for patients who are referred to the podiatry service Applies to patients of Sutton Community Healthcare Services Target Maintain a waiting time of 20 days or less for 80 per cent of patients. \"Our aim is to sustainably deliver a high quality, high value podiatric service for all of our patients.\" Keisha Antonopoulos MSK Service ManagerThe Royal Report and Accounts 2018/19114 115Priority 10b To reduce waiting times for patients who are referred to the musculoskeletal service Applies to adult community services only Target Maintain a waiting time of 20 days or less for 80 per cent of patients. \"We appreciate the frustration that our patients experience in getting an appointment and in order to address this we have reviewed and redesigned our service. We have seen a significant improvement in waiting times for appointments and hope to maintain this as well as further develop the service in order to improve patient experience.\" Anne Howers Divisional Director for Community Services -There was an expected drop during the Easter and summer holidays, which was due to staffing levels at this time -Once further staff were recruited, we consistently achieved our target of over 80 per cent of patients being offered an appointment within 20 days -A change in the type of patients referred, with more requiring biomechanical needs, has been noted. This is a change from previous trends where there has been greater demand on the general cases. To address this, diaries have been adjusted taking into account this change to ensure we work within the 80 per cent target -There will be further challenges on the service with the recent acceptance of another GP practice in Sutton. It is anticipated that recruiting a further member of staff will assist with covering the expected rise in demand. Actions to improve our performance -A new clinic template with named clinicians will be introduced -A review of the demand for followup appointments is underway -The service is currently looking to recruit additional staff -Regular staff supervision and training will be further established -Guidelines will be created for complex patient clinics, continuing treatment and discharge, and escalation in supervision. How improvements will be measured and monitored As of 1 April 2019, The Royal Marsden is no longer commissioned to provide community care. However, recommendations have been communicated to the new service providers to include the above, and this target should be measured by regularly reviewing the 20day access KPI.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19116 117Actions to improve our performance -We will look at using shortterm locums to cover vacancies, with the main aim being to recruit permanent staff -We will secure additional capacity for assessment and treatment by offsetting with followups in periods of low demand -We will review the peak period trends and put measures in place to combat these -We will increase clinic numbers on the days when clinics are scheduled around bank holidays. How improvements will be measured and monitored As of 1 April 2019, The Royal Marsden is no longer commissioned to provide community care. However, recommendations have been communicated to the new service providers to include the above, and this target should be measured by regularly reviewing the 20day access KPI.What we did in 2018/19 -We redesigned our service to improve access for patients and to ensure that they see the right clinician at the right time -The model is iterative and we are regularly reviewing it to ensure that we are meeting and maintaining the desired targets. How we performed in 2018/19 Table 7 shows the average wait days and percentage of patients offered an appointment within 20 working days by the musculoskeletal service in 2018/19. Table 7: Waiting times for musculoskeletal patients Month Percentage of patients offered an appointment within 20 working daysAverage number of wait days April 2018 98.8% 20 May 2018 97.1% 21 June 2018 57.0% 24 July 2018 37.6% 25 August 2018 56.6% 26 September 2018 93.2% 15 October 2018 99.0% 14 November 2018 99.7% 14 December 2018 99.7% 15 January 2019 98.7% 14 February 2019 98.3% 16 March 2019 98.6% 17 -We achieved our target of maintaining a waiting time of 20 days or less for 80 per cent of patients -There was a slight decrease from 2017/18, when 91 per cent of patients were offered an appointment within 20 working days; to 86.19 per cent in 2018/19. There was an increase in the average wait days from 17.25 days in 2017/18; to 18.41 days in 2018/19 -There was an upward trend of waiting times from April 2018 for a combination of reasons, including the bank holidays falling on the day of assess and treat, and reduced capacity due to vacancies. While we managed this in April, the progressive increase in numbers and staff holidays in the June and July period proved more of a challenge -In August we secured a locum and took advantage of an anticipated reduced demand on followups. We moved more clinicians to assess and treat, and offered more new patient slots. We successfully recruited three new members of staff -From September onwards, the KPI has improved to above 90 per cent.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19118 119Statements of assurance from the Board Review of services During 2018/19, we provided or subcontracted comprehensive cancer services and community services. We have reviewed all the information we have on the quality of care provided by all our relevant health services. The income generated by the health services reviewed in 2018/19 is equal to the total income generated from providing relevant health services in 2018/19. The information provided in Part 3 of this Quality Report covers the three aspects of quality: patient safety, clinical effectiveness and patient experience.Sevenday services During 2018/19, we have continued to make significant progress in putting into practice the sevenday clinical standards, building on the work undertaken in 2017/18. Progress has been the result of a large programme of work, led by highly engaged clinicians, including: -Development of the Trust's acute oncology service -Introduction of a joint oncology consultant rota, providing onsite oncology consultant presence at both hospitals at weekends -Implementation of a 14hour electronic review template -Review of handover arrangements and introducing electronic handover -Introduction and development of the Macmillan hotline -Implementation of wardbased senior house officers (SHOs) at the Sutton site -Development of an outofhours standard operating procedure for specialist registrars (SpRs) and introduction of changes to the rota to support SHOs. This also includes further improvements to processes such as handover and improvements in night working -Continuing with a programme of work relating to discharge, therapies support and patient flow, including the implementation of the SAFER patient flow bundle, which blends five elements of best practice: Senior review, All patients, Flow, Early Discharge, Review. An audit was carried out in April 2018 (100 per cent sample of one week's nonelective admissions). Overall, for that period, the Trust achieved 96.4 per cent (weekdays) and 100 per cent (weekend), yielding a result of 96.8 per cent overall for the week, which is a significant improvement on previous audits and exceeds the 2020 target of 90 per cent of emergency admissions having a consultant review within 14 hours.Reviewing progress of the quality improvements in 2018/19 and choosing the new priorities for 2019/20 In December 2018, NHS England published the 'Quality Accounts: Reporting Arrangements for 2019/20'. We chose to include the mandatory (mustdo) set of quality indicators for 2019/20. Some of the indicators are not relevant to us (for example, ambulance response times), so we have not included them. In December 2018, NHS Improvement issued 'Detailed requirements for Quality Reports 2019/20'. They also issued 'Detailed requirements for external assurance for Quality Reports for Foundation Trusts 2019/20', as from 2011/12, all acute trusts must have their Quality Reports checked by external auditors. We also felt it was important to consult with our members and Council of Governors to incorporate their views about 'quality' into the Quality Report. The process for agreeing the quality priorities for 2019/20 was as follows. August 2018 Held a Patient Experience and Quality Account meeting to review progress in quarter 1 (1 April 2018 to 30 June 2018) against our priorities for 2018/19. October 2018 Sent out an online survey to Trust members to choose quality priorities for 2019/20. November 2018 Held an event for Trust members on 10 November 2017 to carry out a survey and vote on quality priorities for 2019/20. December 2018 Council of Governors considered and agreed priorities for 2019/20. Held a Patient Experience and Quality Account meeting to review progress in quarter 2 (1 July 2018 to 31 September 2018) against our priorities for 2018/19. Advisory Committee considered which quality priority to select for 2019/20.Held a Council of Governors meeting to review the results of previous surveys and voting on quality priorities for 2019/20. Council of Governors chose a quality priority for 2019/20. February 2019 The Nursing, Radiography and Rehabilitation Advisory Committee considered which quality priority to select for 2019/20. Held a Patient Experience and Quality Account meeting to review progress during quarter 3 (1 October 2018 to 31 December 2018) against our priorities for 2018/19. March 2019 Drafted the final version of the Quality Report. External stakeholders were given the opportunity to review the draft over a 30day period. The Trust Board Committee reviewed and agreed the quality priorities for 2019/20. The Nursing, Radiography and Rehabilitation Advisory Committee reviewed and agreed the content of the draft Quality Report. April 2019 Stakeholders returned comments and statements are included in Appendix 1. Held a Patient Experience and Quality Account meeting to review progress during quarter 4 (1 January 2018 to 31 March 2018) against our priorities for 2018/19. The Quality Report was reviewed by the Integrated Governance and Risk Management Committee and circulated to the NonExecutive Directors for review and comment. May 2019 Quality Report approved at the Finance and Audit Committee, as delegated by the Board. Final annual Quality Report included as part of the Trust's annual report and sent to NHS Improvement. June 2019 Final annual Quality Report published with Plain English Campaign's Crystal Mark. Annual Quality Report published on the NHS Choices website and the Trust's website.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19120 121Actions and learning from case record reviews and investigations of deaths: -Procedurespecific Trust consent forms should be used wherever possible and should be scanned contemporaneously onto the EPR -For patients with known peritoneal metastases, bowel perforation should be considered if there is clinical deterioration and worsening abdominal pain -For patients with indwelling invasive medical devices, reviews should be undertaken daily to see if they are still required and, if not, they should be removed -Where there are any reasons to doubt a person's capacity to consent to a procedure, teams should complete a mental capacity assessment and best interest decision using the Trust's 'Record of Mental Capacity Assessment and Best interests decision' form -Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) paperwork needs to be scanned onto the EPR and emailed to the Adult Safeguarding team -A reminder that 'Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation' (DNACPR) forms need to be countersigned by the consultant themself within 24 hours of the form being completed. This section cannot be completed on behalf of a consultant -The Principles of Care for Dying Patients documentation should be used on recognition of dying by the whole clinical team -If a patient requires sedation, either for agitated distress or for acute confusion, the family (next of kin) should be informed as soon as possible -When a patient lacks capacity to consent to treatment, a best interests meeting and/or discussion needs to occur and be documented as such on the EPR using the Trust template -Paper consent forms need to be scanned onto the EPR in the consent form tab for all procedures undertaken -Onsite junior doctors and senior AHPs out of hours should have a low threshold to contact nonresident on call registrars for advice and attendance to site -Consent forms for all procedures should be scanned onto the EPR contemporaneously under the consent tab -Timely discussions regarding treatment escalations plans should occur, particularly regarding resuscitation status -Patients who attend for investigations from other hospitals need to arrive with documentation regarding resuscitation status if this has been discussed previously -Referral to palliative care should be considered for inpatients with malignant bowel obstruction -All patients who have long hospital stays should have regular updates with their family/those closest to them and the clinical team -All new hospital admissions require a consultant review documented on the EPR within 14 hours -Documentation of performance status when prescribing inpatient chemotherapy. Impact of the actions: We take seriously the learning provided from reviewing all patient deaths and, while it is too early this year, we hope to see an improvement in the next year once we have put the identified actions into practice.Learning from deaths During 2018/19, we continued to review all deaths in the hospital each month. Table 8 shows the number of patients who died between April 2018 to March 2019. During 2017/18, a policy was introduced that outlined how we would make sure that all deaths at the Trust would be reviewed and how we would share learning across the Trust. The policy was approved at the Trust's Board meeting and at the Integrated Governance and Risk Management Committee in September 2017. Table 8: Number of patients who died and number of case record reviews and investigations Time period Number of patients who died at The Royal MarsdenNumber of cases where a record review or an investigation was completedNumber of cases where a record review and an investigation was completedNumber of deaths due to a problem in care providedPercentage of deaths due to a problem in care provided* April to June 2018 62 62 11 0 0% July to September 2018 61 61 7 0 0% October to December 2018 52 52 9 0 0% January to March 2019 54 54 7 0 0% Total 229 229 34 0 0% *Note: The percentages have been estimated using the Royal College of Physician's suggested framework 'Structured Judgement Review' (SJR) to carry out the investigation. From April 2018 to March 2019, 229 case record reviews and 34 investigations were carried out in relation to all of the deaths shown in Table 8. We use the Royal College of Physician's suggested framework 'Structured Judgement Review' to carry out investigations. In 34 cases, we carried out both a case record review and an investigation. The number of deaths in each quarter for which a case record review or an investigation was carried out is shown in Table 8. There were no patient deaths during April 2018 to March 2019 that were judged to be more likely than not due to problems in the care provided to the patient. This is shown for each quarter in Table 8. There were no case record reviews or investigations that finished in the reporting period 2018/19 which related to deaths during the previous reporting period of 2017/18.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19122 123Table 9: National clinical audits we took part in during 2018/19 No Name of national clinical audit or clinical outcome review programmeCases submitted, expressed as a percentage of the number of registered cases required 1 National OesophagoGastric (OG) Cancer Audit 100% 2 National Bowel Cancer Audit (NBOCA) 100% 3 National Lung Cancer Audit (NCLA) Data taken directly from the monthly Cancer Outcome Services Dataset (COSD) upload.

We participate in all the national cancer audits that apply to our organisation. This allows us to compare ourselves against other hospitals in England and sometimes across the world. We also have a comprehensive programme of local clinical audits which clinical staff, including consultants, junior doctors, nurses and allied health professionals, conduct regularly to improve local areas of care. Between April 2018 and March 2019, 30 national clinical audits and two national confidential enquiries covered relevant health services that The Royal Marsden provides. National clinical audit and confidential enquiries National confidential enquiries are 'inspections' that are carried out nationally to investigate areas of care where there may have been problems or where the patients may be particularly vulnerable. All hospitals are asked to take part in them so that all care across England can be monitored. Between April 2018 and March 2019, The Royal Marsden registered or took part in 30 (100 per cent) national clinical audits and all national confidential enquiries in which we were eligible to take part in (Table 9). We cannot carry out many of the national audits carried out by other hospitals because we only have patients with cancer. The national clinical audits and national confidential enquiries that The Royal Marsden took part in, and which we collected data for (for the period April 2018 to March 2019), are listed below, including cases submitted to each audit or enquiry as a percentage of the number of registered cases required by the terms of that audit or enquiry (Tables 9 and 10).The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19124 125No National Clinical Audit reports published in 2018/19 Description of actions 8 BAUS Analysis of Nephrectomy audit data Surgeons reflected on the findings.

This is important because it means that our patients and our staff are always aware of the latest research in treatments, medicines and therapies that make such a big difference to outcomes and patients' experiences of care. If you would like to find out more about our research work, visit our website at www.royalmarsden.nhs.uk. From 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019, we recruited 3,334 patients as part of 490 different clinical studies in research approved by a research ethics committee. Overall, there are 490 clinical studies that the Trust participated in during this period. Table 13: Number of patients taking part in clinical research studies Year Number of patients Number of 4,239 542 Revalidation of doctors This year (April 2018 to March 2019), there were 63 doctors due for revalidation (the process of making sure that doctors, except trainees, can stay registered). We made 59 (94 per cent) positive recommendations for revalidation, and there were four (six per cent) deferrals. Three were valid deferrals, with two being due to the doctors having joined the trust less than six months prior to their revalidation date, and one was due to maternity leave. There was one nonvalid deferral due to insufficient evidence, but after providing them with more time we have now been able to submit a positive recommendation this year. At the end of March 2019, 97 per cent of eligible doctors (98 per cent of consultants) were recorded as having completed an appraisal in the last 12 months. An annual report on appraisal and revalidation was produced in September 2018, with a clear action plan to increase the number of doctors with a valid appraisal and reduce the number of deferrals to the General Medical Council (GMC). We also have processes in place to support and improve our compliance and governance arrangements. We will complete an internal audit this financial year, and we report our appraisal rates to NHS England each quarter. Commissioning for Quality and Innovation CQUIN is a mechanism for commissioners to reward quality by linking a proportion of our income (2-2.5 per cent in 2018/19) to our success in meeting quality improvement goals. The provisional total payment if we achieve the quality improvement and innovation goals in 2018/19 is \u00a33,244,186. The total payment we received for the CQUIN in 2017/18 was \u00a33,236,812. CQUIN goals for 2018/19 have been agreed with commissioners in the following subject areas for cancer specialist services and for community services. Further details of the agreed goals for April 2018 to March 2019, and for the following 12month period, are available on the website at www.england.nhs.uk/nhsstandardcontract/cquin/cquin1719/. Please note we worked with commissioners to tailor the CQUIN for the Trust so there may be some variation from the national targets specified.Name of local audit How did the clinical audit help patients and staff? Audit of Dementia Practices: use of 'This is Me' Hospital PassportDiscuss audit results in the Integrated Safeguarding Committee and the Safeguarding Children and Adults Board. Highlight audit results within appropriate management meetings. Highlight use of 'This Is me' hospital passport within the preassessment process and Frailty Team. Highlight use of 'This Is Me' hospital passport within unit/ward where patient has been identified with dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Promotional awareness of 'This is Me' hospital passport through Trust media, such as the weekly newsletter produced by marketing and communications. Incorporate the audit results within the Dementia Tier 1 awareness training and other relevant training as appropriate. A multifaceted intervention to promote rational laboratory test ordering at The Royal Marsden in SuttonFurther education should be given to new SHOs, physician associates, advanced nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, ward sisters and nurses to improve rational laboratory test ordering. Explore alternative option to handover bloods test for the next day. 5 harms community documentation audit (adults services)Results discussed at monthly senior community nurse meetings and local nursing team meetings.

Prescribing and Administration Practice of Lidocaine 5% patchTo establish a robust review reminder system from outpatient pharmacy to empower patients to ask for a review prior to their next outpatient appointment at week 4 of initiating Lidocaine 5% patch. Dissemination of the audit results to the relevant clinical areas to raise awareness (i.e. pain, palliative care, chief pharmacist, breast, sarcoma and gastrointestinal clinics). Reaudit 12 months postimplementation of review system to establish effectiveness. The next audit to involve the Sutton site, to gain a comprehensive insight to Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster usage across the Trust. Cost savings post any implementation to be monitored based on the previous year's average monthly spend (and reported).The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19130 131We continue to improve the services that we deliver to patients and have developed an internal action plan to monitor our progress. The inspector also meets quarterly as part of this new inspection and monitoring plan. During these visits, the inspector will visit some clinical areas, meet with junior and senior staff in focus groups, and meet with senior managers in the Trust. Quality of information Good quality information is very important for effectively providing the best patient care. During 2018/19, the Trust sent all mandated commissioning datasets as required (these datasets are included in national databases which contain details of all admissions, outpatient appointments and Accident and Emergency (A&E) care at NHS hospitals in England). The percentage of the Trust's records published in the statistics, and which included the patient's valid NHS number, was 99.95 per cent for admissions, 99.95 per cent for outpatient appointments, and none for A&E care (The Royal Marsden does not have an A&E). The percentage of records that included the valid General Medical Practice Code for the patient's GP practice was 99.87 per cent for admissions, 99.81 per cent for outpatient appointments and none for A&E care. See Table 14 for more information. Table 14: Percentage of complete records provided Details included Admissions - inpatient and 2018/19 99.87% 99.81% Although the quality of information is very good, the Trust aims for continual improvement. The Trust performs the following actions to improve the quality of information: -A dedicated data quality team is responsible for running routine checks and reports to identify mistakes and inconsistencies -Monthly communications throughout the Trust promote the importance of accurate information and data collection for all Trust staff -Trustwide audits of the quality of key information points are conducted once a year.NHS England Acute CQUIN schemes From April 2018 to March 2019, we have agreed milestones for the following: -Nationally standardised dose banding -Hospital medicines optimisation -Enhanced supportive care access for advanced cancer patients -Sustainability and transformation plan -Stereotactic radiotherapy services dataset.

What others say about The Royal Marsden Registration with the Care Quality Commission The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust (the Trust) must be registered with the Care Quality Commission (CGC). Their current registration status is 'registered with no conditions'. The CQC has not taken enforcement action against the Trust during 2018/19. The Royal Marsden has not been involved in any of the CQC's special reviews or investigations during 2018/19. Care Quality Commission ratings The CQC undertook an unannounced inspection of Sutton Community Services and The Royal Marsden Outpatients Department in May 2018. The well led inspection took place in July 2018. We received the report in October 2018 and the Trust received a rating of 'outstanding'.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19132 133Part 3 Other information Please see Part 2 of this report for an overview of the quality of care offered by the Trust.

Patients should start treatment within 18 weeks of referral. Complex rules and guidance apply to how performance against these targets are measured and reported. As a specialist provider, receiving referrals from other trusts, a key issue is reporting progression for patients who were first referred to other providers. The 'incomplete pathways' measure in Table 17 is the proportion of patients at the end of the reporting period who are still waiting for treatment, and have waited for less than 18 weeks since their initial referral.Data Security and Protection Toolkit (DSPT) attainment levels The Information Governance Toolkit is a legal framework under which NHS organisations must assess themselves against Department of Health and Social Care policies and standards. However, this year's toolkit has undergone a complete redesign and has been renamed the 'Data Security and Protection Toolkit' (DSPT). The requirements of the DSPT are designed to encompass the National Data Guardian (NDG) review and ten data security standards. The requirements of the DSPT support key requirements under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), identified in the NHS GDPR checklist document. Compliance with the new toolkit is achieved by submitting evidence for all mandatory questions. The Trust has submitted evidence for all mandatory questions for the toolkit. The DSPT is available on NHS Digital's website (www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/). Information governance incidents Since the introduction of GDPR, which took effect on the 25 May 2018, and the Data Protection Act 2018, incident reporting requirements have changed. There are now three types of breaches reportable under the new regime: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. In addition, the UK is implementing the EU Directive on the security of Networks and Information Systems (the NIS Directive). The fines for a breach of the new data protection legislation have increased from \u00a3500,000 to a maximum \u20ac20,000,000, or four per cent of gross annual turnover. The Royal Marsden has reported two incidents in 2018/19. Neither met the requirements for reporting to the Information Commissioner's Office. To date, The Royal Marsden has not been levied a fine for breaching data protection legislation and regulatory requirements. The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust's Information Governance Assessment Report overall score for the data security and protection toolkit was 100 per cent for all mandatory questions. Payment by Results clinical coding error rate Clinical coding is translating the medical terminology written by clinicians into a coded format for statistical, clinical and financial purposes. Clinical coding describes a patient's complaint, diagnosis, treatment and reason for getting medical attention. We were not subject to the Payment by Results clinical coding audit during 2018/19.

The Trust recognises that effective speaking up arrangements help to protect patients and improve staff experience. The Francis Report highlighted the importance of developing a culture of openness and transparency within the NHS, and events at Gosport Hospital in 2018 reinforced the need to encourage staff to speak up and ensure that that there are mechanisms in place to respond to those concerns. At The Royal Marsden, we are working to further embed this approach and to ensure that staff feel safe, and aim to instil confidence in raising concerns throughout our organisation. There are mechanisms in place designed to enable staff to raise concerns and these include: -Datix reporting - staff can report concerns via the incident reporting system known as Datix -Line management - concerns can be raised via the staff member's line manager -Trade Unions/HR Team - concerns can be raised directly with the HR Team or Trade Unions -Trust Guardian and Freedom to Speak Up Champion - Professor Martin Elliott is the NonExecutive Lead for Raising Concerns. The Trust also recently appointed a new Trust Guardian, who is supported by a network of six divisional Freedom to Speak Up Champions. These champions work in tandem with the Trust's arrangements for whistleblowing, ensuring that the individual raising the concern has the correct information about Trust policies and procedures, and feels supported to raise staffing or patient safety concerns -Guardian of Safe Working (for junior doctors) - Dr Andrew McLeod is the Guardian of Safe Working. This role is aimed at ensuring junior doctors work safely and that their schedule enables them to fulfil their education commitments. There is a formal mechanism for exceptions to agreed working patterns and educational commitments to be reported by junior doctors to the Guardian of Safe Working -Whistleblowing - the Whistleblowing NonExecutive Director lead is Professor Martin Elliott and the Director of Workforce is the operational lead -Antiharassment advisers - we have listening service for staff who have concerns about harassment and bullying, which is run by trained staff volunteers. Staff Survey results suggest that staff feel confident about raising concerns. The Trust achieved the highest score nationally for fairness and effectiveness of reporting procedures. These results reflect a strong patient safety culture. Rota gaps and vacancies The Trust, in partnership with the Guardian of Safe Working, regularly reviews Exception Reports to ensure safeguards are in place to maintain safe hours of work and service commitments do not comprise the educational experience of trainees. A total of 73 exceptions were reported, of which none were highlighted as immediate safety concerns for 2018/19. Of the 73 reports, 71 were due to hours/rest and two were based on unavoidable rota issues which were addressed immediately. Work schedule reviews took place for 21 doctors across 15 rotas; 21 of these were resolved at the level 1 stage with either compensation, time off in lieu or no action required. The latest information indicates that there are 13 vacant doctors in training posts as of March 2019.Table 17: Referral time to treatmentOverall only NHS waiting time standard that is reported while the patient is still waiting. For this reason, it creates unique challenges in making sure the most uptodate information is reported accurately each month. We rely on receiving information rapidly from external sources to assess whether the patient is on an 18week pathway (18 weeks of treatment) and to determine the start date of the pathway. In order to tackle the challenges above, we calculated a revised figure for the RTT standard. This was in order to assess the size of the changes that are made to the information during the 18week pathway. The revised figure showed that the materiality was negligible (approximately 0.18 per cent). Table 18: Access targets Percentage of operations cancelled by the Trust at the last minutePercentage of cancelled operations not subsequently performed within one month 2016/17 0.4% 0.6% 0.01% Outpatient waiting times The number of outpatients attending appointments has increased by between two per cent and five per cent a year, over the past five years.

We commend the Trust on its performance against the quality priorities for 2018/19. We welcome the commitment of the Trust to its quality priorities for 2019/20 and to its four corporate objectives of improving patient safety and clinical effectiveness; improving patient experience; delivering excellence in teaching and research and ensuring financial and environmental sustainability. We welcome the commitment of the Trust to reduce chemotherapy waiting times and the introduction of the new priorities for 2019/20 of earlier and faster diagnosis of cancer across Royal Marsden Partners; to develop an innovative mortality/palliative care metric and ensure a reduction in phlebotomy waiting times. We congratulate The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust on its Quality Account and its achievements in 2018/19. We look forward to continuing to work with The Trust in the coming year. Robert Freeman, Chairman, Adult Social Care and Health Scrutiny Committee, Royal Borough of Kensington and ChelseaHealthwatch Central West London Response to The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Quality Report (received April 2019) We welcome the opportunity to comment on The Royal Marsden Quality Accounts (QA), and to comment on the quality of the services commissioned locally to meet the health needs of local residents. We are pleased to have worked with the Trust this year through the Patient Experience and Quality Accounts Steering group. Our members commend The Royal Marsden for its achievements this year, including; healthcare infections prevention, maintain patient safety, reduction of emergency readmission, reducing waiting times, research excellence and treatment. Our members commend The Royal Marsden for its achievements this year, including; research excellence, high standards of academic performance and receiving 'Outstanding' following the CQC inspection for Sutton Community Services and The Royal Marsden outpatient's department. Comments on QA 2018/19 QA presentation and layout Overall accessibility of QA We commend the Trust on its 'What is a Quality Account overview' and 'Introduction to The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust' which provide a good background to the Quality Accounts and a good introduction of the FiveYear Strategic Plan 2018/19 to 2023/24. We welcome the Trust's clear use of headings and subheadings throughout the QA. To make the QA more userfriendly the Trust should consider using a more accessible font i.e. Arial or Calibri with a minimum font size of 12 for the main body of the text. Use of graphs and tables Our members welcome the use of tables to highlight key information. We feel that the table used on pages 78 - 82 clearly presents the quality priorities and targets for the year 2018/19.Plain English Campaign's Crystal Mark does not apply to Appendix 1 Appendix 1 Statements from key stakeholdersDirector of Quality, Sutton Clinical Commissioning Group (received 2019) The CCG has been working closely with the Trust during the year, gaining assurance of the delivery of safe and effective services. A range of indicators in relation to quality, safety and performance is presented and discussed at regular meetings between the Trust and CCG. The information presented within the quality accounts is consistent with information supplied to the commissioner throughout the year. We can confirm that we have no reason to believe this Quality Account is not an accurate representation of the performance of the organisation during 2018. The Trust has actively worked to reduce the waiting times for children's therapies. The CCG notes the continued challenge associated with workforce requirements for community services and has sought assurance regarding the impact on specialist nursing services. Community Services has consistently received positive feedback from patients, carers and families regarding services provided. The Trust has supported the CCG and partners in the development of proactive model of care through the development of locality based multidisciplinary team meeting. The Trust has worked with the CCG to support the transition of community services to the new provider alliance Sutton Health and Care from 2019/20. Agreed by Sutton Community Services CQRG Chair/Joint Clinical Director Karol SelveyThe Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19138 139Statement from the Council of Governors on the Quality Account (received May 2019) Governors would like to acknowledge the impressive work so clearly and succinctly reported in the Quality Account for 2018/19. The Account summarises the performance and improvements staff at The Royal Marsden have made against the objectives within the three quality priority areas; safe care, effective care and patient experience. Results highlighting the Trust's performance in these quality areas are reported by the Chief Nurse to the Council of Governor's meeting every quarter. A subset of governors, through their membership of the Trust's Patient Experience and Quality Account Group (PEQA) which meets six times a year, then have the opportunity to comment in greater depth on the ongoing data, review feedback from patients, including the frequent feedback surveys, and influence the questions used in these surveys to reflect patients' interests. PEQA's other roles are to monitor improvements in the outcome of the patient experience and to work with staff on the content and presentation of the Quality Account so that it accurately reflects the outcomes of the set priorities. All governors, alongside members of the Trust and staff also take part in choosing the priorities for quality improvement for the following year. Cancer patients are highly susceptible to hospital acquired bacterial infections and we are fully supportive of the collaborative research work now underway with the Christie and Clatterbridge cancer centres to reduce patient infection risks and implement the joint gramnegative bacterial infection Quality Improvement Project. The appointment of the Darzi fellow to work specifically in this area will also aid the development of enhanced control and prevention strategies for these infections. In addition, reducing harm from sepsis remains an extremely important priority for the Trust and measures are well established now to ensure that rapid, effective reviews and treatment are carried out. These priorities will be carried over to the 2019/20 Quality Account. Governors are very pleased to note that all three quality priorities within the safe care and effective care categories met their targets in 2018/19 through the dedicated work of the staff caring for the Marsden patients. The patient experience at outpatient clinics continues to improve with 80 per cent of patients now waiting 15 minutes or less for their appointment. For chemotherapy, where waiting times may be longer than 30 minutes for many patients, several initiatives are now underway to speed up the process of preparing and delivering the chemotherapy drugs to the relevant treatment clinics at both the Chelsea and Sutton sites. We acknowledge the tremendous hard work that is being done to contribute to patient satisfaction and the patient experience. 2018/19 is the last year that The Royal Marsden hospital Trust is responsible for Sutton Community Health Care Services. Governors are pleased that the priorities and targets that were set last year for patients requiring podiatry and musculoskeletal services were all achieved, and we wish the new providers of the community services all the very best for the future. Finally, governors wholeheartedly endorse the continued improvements to the presentation and layout of the Quality Account, making it more interesting and easier to read by the general public and healthcare professionals alike. We congratulate the staff at The Royal Marsden for their tremendous efforts on behalf of patients to make their journey through cancer treatment as safe, effective and as pleasant as possible and fully support the new priorities outlined for 2019/20. Council of Governors, 1 May 2019Our members are pleased to see that tables were used across the QA to make it clearer visual and understanding. Our members are also very pleased to see actions to improve the performance where was relevant. Quotes We welcome the Trust's use of quotes in all relevant sections. Patient engagement Friends and Family Test We commend The Royal Marsden for achieving 95 per cent of inpatients and 95 per cent of outpatients saying that they would recommend you as part of the Friends and Family test. We would recommend adding a table or graph of the results of the question \"How likely are you to recommend this service to friends and family if they require similar care or treatment?\". Patient experience Our members were pleased to hear about the public meetings which gives patients the opportunity to vote on their behalf about priorities. Our members would like to congratulate The Royal Marsden for adding the priorities on their own reflecting the needs of their patients. Targets Our members were pleased to find out about the new project to improve patient' experience in waiting times at chemotherapy appointments. Our members are looking forward to finding more about the performance rates and are pleased to see action taken.Conclusion Our members commend The Royal Marsden for its ongoing commitment to patient care and engagement. We are pleased to hear of developments from the new transformation project group around the chemotherapy appointment waiting times, especially regarding patient feedback captured and how The Royal Marsden will endeavour to improve the patient experience. Healthwatch and our members would like to congratulate The Royal Marsden for a such good and comprehensive documents which informs all levels of interest knowledge and enquiries. We look forward to continuing to work with The Royal Marsden in improving the care and support of patients.

Approval of the Quality Report: Cally Palmer CBE Chief Executive 23 May 2019 Charles Alexander Chairman 23 May 2019 Chair, Patient Carer and Advisory Group (received April 2019) Members of the Patient and Carer Advisory Group ('PCAG') of The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust ('the Trust') have considered and commented on successive drafts of the Trust's Annual Quality Account for the period 2018/19, working alongside governors and staff in the Patient Experience and Quality Account Group. We have been pleased to see clear evidence of the steps taken by the Trust to maintain, and improve further, both the quality of care it provides and the experience of its patients, their carers and its staff. We commend the Trust in closely monitoring its performance against its stated objectives for the year. We are pleased to see that all the quality priorities and targets to ensure safe and effective care have been achieved, and note particularly the successes in keeping the number of hospital acquired infections, incidence of pressure ulcers and medication incidents at very low levels. We also welcome the steps taken over the year to reduce harm from sepsis and look forward to continued improvement.Considering patient experience targets, PCAG applauds the continued reduction in waiting times for patients in the Trust's outpatient clinics: on average only three per cent of patients waited for more than an hour for treatment, with 80 per cent waiting for less than 15 minutes. We welcome the introduction of the new Day Care Improvement Programme to streamline chemotherapy pathways and the success of the batch chemotherapy pilot scheme. We look forward to seeing the full effects of these initiatives, as they are rolled out in both hospitals during the coming year, together with improvements in phlebotomy waiting times. The responses of patients to the Friends and Family Test again show overwhelming satisfaction with the treatment and care received with over 95 per cent stating that they would recommend the Trust to their friends and family, should they require treatment. PCAG looks forward to working with Trust staff to ensure that any freetext comments made as part of the Friends and Family Test are carefully considered and where appropriate acted upon. Overall, PCAG congratulates the Trust on its Quality Account and its achievements over the year, in particular its welldeserved CQC 'outstanding' rating. We look forward to working with the Trust to help bring further improvements to the care and experience of the Trust's patients over the coming year.

Appendix 3 Quality indicators where national data is available from NHS Digital Since 2012/13, NHS foundation trusts have been required to report performance against a core set of indicators, using data made available to the Trust previously by the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC), and now from NHS Digital. The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust considers that these data are as described, as taken from the nationally defined data sources. The Trust has taken actions to improve the percentage and so the quality of its services (see priorities for each indicator in Part 2 of this Quality Report for further information). Not all of the core indicators are relevant to The Royal Marsden, for example those relating to the ambulance response times (as there is no A&E at the Trust). The tables that follow show those core indicators that are relevant and how the Trust compares against other trusts. The tables show the highest and lowest national scores. The information is the latest that is made available nationally by NHS Digital. All information provided by the Trust is validated and checked before it is reported.

The campaign ran from 2015 until late 2018. Initially a patient safety improvement plan was set in June 2015. The priority areas were set and agreed with the aim of reducing avoidable harm in three distinct areas: -Sepsis -Medication errors -Pressure ulcers. In each area, a safety group was established. The following sections show the aims and outcomes relating to each area. The campaign has now ended and going forward is the Harm Free Care agenda which started in April 2019. Patient safety improvement plans - increasing awareness, identification and treatment of sepsis and reducing death from it Aims: -Raise awareness and educate staff, patients and carers -Prevent and control infection -Identify and treat patients with sepsis as early as possible -Deliver the sepsis six care bundle -Escalation and review. Primary goals Progress 2018/19 Raise awareness and educate staff, patients and carersAnnually we have held sepsis road shows at the Chelsea and Sutton sites to raise awareness. This has been achieved and continues. Prevent and control infection This includes effective management of the use of antibiotics. This concept is known as 'antimicrobial stewardship'. It balances the need to administer effective antimicrobial medications promptly when needed, with the need to reduce their use to prevent resistance to them from spreading (which will make them useless). This goal developed into a CQUIN presented later in the table. Identify and treat patients with sepsis as early as possibleThis includes sepsis screening to increase the numbers identified in the 'Golden Hour'. This is the period in which early recognition and treatment can reduce the risk of sepsis progressing and so improve outcomes. We also put into practice SBAR training. To help healthcare professionals get appropriate advice and action in good time, the SBAR tool has been introduced to provide a structure for communication between colleagues. The four letters of SBAR indicate the Situation (problem being discussed), Background (the medical history of the patient and treatment to date), Assessment (of the patient) and Recommendation (of the person leading the discussion). This goal developed into a CQUIN presented later in the table.Appendix 4 Our values Our values updated We, The Royal Marsden, are guided by 16 values that define our: -characteristics (what we are) -attitudes (how we act) -relationships (how we relate to others) and -emotions (how we feel). Characteristics Attitudes Relationships Emotions Pioneering Determined Collaborative Compassionate Aspirational Confident Supportive Positive Knowledgeable Open Trusted Calm Driven Resilient Personable Proud In 2018, the 'Outstanding Care; Outstanding Culture' programme, to refresh the current Trust values, was launched. This programme of work was designed to facilitate the development of a refreshed set of organisational values to support Trust's FiveYear Strategic Plan, through engagement with staff and patients. Throughout 2018/19, more than 350 staff participated in workshops and surveys related to the refreshing of the values. As part of the workshops staff received valuable training in how to give feedback, and awareness was raised about the link between staff experience and patient experience. The new values will be rolled out in April 2019 and embedded into recruitment, induction, training and appraisals.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19148 149Patient safety improvement plans - reducing harm from medication errors Aims: -Improve the pharmacyled medicines reconciliation rates on admission to 100 per cent by 2018 -Reduce the prevalence of chemotherapy prescriber errors by 20 per cent by 2018 -Ensure accurate allergies are documented in 100 per cent of patients on admission. Primary goals Progress 2018/19 Improve the pharmacyled medicines reconciliation rates on admission to 100% by 2018The medication safety thermometer was set up in 2016. Medicines reconciliation is the first step to ensure that patients take their medicines correctly by reducing harm through omitted doses, avoiding taking unnecessary medicines, reducing wastage of medicines, and ensuring that medicines are prescribed and taken safely to improve outcomes from medicines use. The ongoing audit is collected via a snapshot audit on one day every month for inpatients and shows that we are consistently achieving high rates of medicines reconciliation. The national average is 67% and we achieved 93% in Q3/4 in 2018/19. The monthly results are highlighted on ward dashboards and shared with nursing and pharmacy staff via a monthly newsletter. Reduce the prevalence of chemotherapy prescriber errors by 20% by 2018This aim was to review the benefits of implementation and utilisation of chemotherapy eprescribing technology to reduce the opportunity for harm from prescribing errors. Chemotherapy eprescribing was introduced into the Trust. An audit was carried out in January 2016 following the majority of an echemo roll out (excluding CTs). The audit showed a reduction in number of errors by 35% in comparison to the last audit in 2011 preechemo implementation. This is largely due to the large number of type of errors now obsolete following echemo implementation. The benefits of echemo are reduced errors, efficiencies on nonreliance on paper charts, and allowing multiple staff the ability to prescribe remotely and screen prescriptions with a clear audit trail. Ensure accurate allergies are documented in 100% of patients on admissionThis aim was to reduce the harm related to hypersensitivity and allergy reactions through consistent assessment and recording of patient medication patient allergy status at admission. Data are collected via the medicines safety thermometer monthly snapshot audit. We record consistently high rates of inpatient documentation of allergy status and achieved 98% in Q3/Q4 2018/19.Primary goals Progress 2018/19 Deliver the sepsis six care bundle The 'sepsis six' is a group of interventions that may help treat patients with sepsis. The six interventions are providing oxygen, taking blood cultures (a sample of blood sent to the microbiology laboratory to identify organisms making the patient unwell), giving antibiotics early on to fight the infection, measuring lactate (as high levels in the blood may indicate a severe infection), fluid challenge (administering fluid) and measuring urine production (which generally falls as the patient becomes more unwell and increases when the patient improves). The sepsissix has been introduced into the Trust in addition to the National Early Warning Score (NEWS2). In terms of antibiotics, we aim to give antibiotics within an hour of suspected sepsis. We have improved our success in meeting the target. Currently, all patients who are admitted to CCU with sepsis were already on antibiotics, or received them within an hour of sepsis being suspected. This goal developed into a CQUIN presented later in the table. Escalation and review This involves a senior review of the patient (by a registrar or a consultant). Escalation involves getting help from more senior members of the team, as well as increasing the amount of care for the patient, such as transferring them from the ward to the CCU. Overall, the audit of cases admitted to the CCU shows a gradual increase in the survival of patients with sepsis, with a higher proportion of patients surviving and going home from the CCU. In Q3 2016/17, CCU survival was 55%; in Q3 2018/19. In Q3 2016/17, survival to hospital discharge was to 80% in Q3 2018/19. CQUIN 90% of patients who require screening 97% of patients received sepsis screening. CQUIN 2018/19: 90%of patients treated with antibiotics within one hour of diagnosisAchieved 100% of patients treated with antibiotics within one hour. CQUIN 2018/19: 90% of patients who received an antimicrobial review within 72 hoursAchieved 100% received an antimicrobial review within 72 hours. CQUIN 2018/19: 75% of patients who received an antimicrobial review within 72 hours PLUS reviewed by an appropriate clinician PLUS a documented IV rationaleAchieved 100% received an antimicrobial review within 72 hours, PLUS reviewed by an appropriate clinician, PLUS a documented IV rationale.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19150 151Plain English Campaign's Crystal Mark does not apply to Appendix 6. Appendix 6 Independent auditor's assurance report Independent auditor's report to the council of governors of The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust on the quality report We have been engaged by the council of governors of The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust to perform an independent assurance engagement in respect of The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust's quality report for the year ended 31 March 2019 (the 'Quality Report') and certain performance indicators contained therein. This report, including the conclusion, has been prepared solely for the council of governors of The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust as a body, to assist the council of governors in reporting The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust's quality agenda, performance and activities. We permit the disclosure of this report within the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2019, to enable the council of governors to demonstrate they have discharged their governance responsibilities by commissioning an independent assurance report in connection with the indicators. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Council of Governors as a body and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust for our work or this report, except where terms are expressly agreed and with our prior consent in writing.Scope and subject matter The indicators for the year ended 31 March 2019 subject to limited assurance consist of the national priority indicators as mandated by NHS Improvement (NHSI): -maximum waiting time of 62 days from urgent GP referral to first treatment for all cancers, reported in accordance with the 2016 National Cancer Breach Allocation Guidance; and -Percentage of incomplete pathways within 18 weeks for patients on incomplete pathways at the end of the period. We refer to these national priority indicators collectively as the 'indicators'. Respective responsibilities of the directors and auditors The directors are responsible for the content and the preparation of the quality report in accordance with the criteria set out in the 'NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual' issued by NHS Improvement. Our responsibility is to form a conclusion, based on limited assurance procedures, on whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that: -the quality report is not prepared in all material respects in line with the criteria set out in the 'NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual' and supporting guidance; -the quality report is not consistent in all material respects with the sources specified in section 2.1 of the NHS Improvement 2018/19 Detailed guidance for external assurance on quality reports; and -the indicators in the quality report identified as having been the subject of limited assurance in the quality report are not reasonably stated in all material respects in accordance with the 'NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual' and supporting guidance and the six dimensions of data quality set out in the 'Detailed guidance for external assurance on quality reports'.Patient safety improvement plans - reducing harm from pressure ulcers Aims: To reduce avoidable pressure ulcers by 50 per cent within hospitals and 50 per cent within the community by June 2018 through: -Early identification and detection of atrisk patients -Prevention of pressure ulcers -Education and raising awareness -Reporting and review. Primary goals Progress 2018/19 Early identification and detection of atrisk patientsWe have introduced the nationally recognised European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) 2014 guidelines for six categories (categories 1, 2, 3, 4, deep tissue injury and unstageable). The coproduced aSSKINg bundle was launched in April 2019. We have held the first national prevalence audit. Prevention of pressure ulcers We held 'Stop the Pressure/End PJ Paralysis' awareness days and recorded a 10minute Q&A session on pressure ulcer prevention on Marsden Radio. We launched the medical device selection guide and upgraded all inpatient beds. We have prevented 100% of heelrelated pressure ulcers in CCU and an overall reduction of 47% of pressure ulcers Trustwide. Education and raising awareness We have held annual education events and designed quarterly training sessions for the new inhouse champion network. The aSSKINg prevention video has been launched. We have held a mock coroner's court. We have also developed the Multiprofessional Pressure Ulcer Collaborative Group, which has designed a pressure ulcer prevention elearning module and new patient information leaflet. Reporting and review The tissue viability nurses review and confirm type of pressure ulcer within 72 hours. We have introduced mini root cause analysis for category 2 pressure ulcers and completed the monthly quality report with narrative and actions.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19152 153Limitations Nonfinancial performance information is subject to more inherent limitations than financial information, given the characteristics of the subject matter and the methods used for determining such information. The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw allows for the selection of different, but acceptable measurement techniques which can result in materially different measurements and can affect comparability. The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary. Furthermore, the nature and methods used to determine such information, as well as the measurement criteria and the precision of these criteria, may change over time. It is important to read the quality report in the context of the criteria set out in the 'NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual' and supporting guidance. The scope of our assurance work has not included testing of indicators other than the two selected mandated indicators, or consideration of quality governance.Conclusion Based on the results of our procedures, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that, for the year ended 31 March 2019: -the quality report is not prepared in all material respects in line with the criteria set out in the 'NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual' and supporting guidance; -the quality report is not consistent in all material respects with the sources specified in 2.1 of the NHS Improvement 2018/19 Detailed guidance for external assurance on quality reports; and -the indicators in the quality report subject to limited assurance have not been reasonably stated in all material respects in accordance with the 'NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual' and supporting guidance. Deloitte LLP St Albans 24 May 2019 We read the quality report and consider whether it addresses the content requirements of the 'NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual' and supporting guidance, and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any material omissions. We read the other information contained in the quality report and consider whether it is materially inconsistent with -Board minutes for the period April 2018 to May 2019; -papers relating to quality reported to the board over the period April 2018 to May 2019; -feedback from the Commissioners dated 11 April 2019; -feedback from the governors dated 8 May 2019; -feedback from local Healthwatch organisations, dated 26 April 2019; -feedback from Overview and Scrutiny Committee, dated 6 April 2019; -the Trust's complaints report published under regulation 18 of the Local Authority Social Services and NHS Complaints Regulations 2009, dated May 2019; -the latest National Patient Survey dated June 2018; -the latest National Staff Survey dated 28 February 2019; -Care Quality Commission inspection report dated 18 September 2018; -the Head of Internal Audit's annual opinion over the trust's control environment dated 21 May 2019; and -any other information included in our review.We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with those documents (collectively the 'documents'). Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information. We are in compliance with the applicable independence and competency requirements of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) Code of Ethics. Our team comprised assurance practitioners and relevant subject matter experts. Assurance work performed We conducted this limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) - 'Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information' issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board ('ISAE 3000'). Our limited assurance procedures included: -evaluating the design and implementation of the key processes and controls for managing and reporting the indicators; -making enquiries of management; -testing key management controls; -limited testing, on a selective basis, of the data used to calculate the indicator back to supporting documentation; -comparing the content requirements of the 'NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual' to the categories reported in the quality report; and -reading the documents. A limited assurance engagement is smaller in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement. The nature, timing and extent of procedures for gathering sufficient appropriate evidence are deliberately limited relative to a reasonable assurance engagement.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19154 155Information governance A process that makes sure that organisations achieve good practice relating to data protection and confidentiality.

We have audited the financial statements which comprise: -the Statement of Comprehensive Income; -the Statement of -the Statement of Changes Taxpayers' Equity; -the Statement of Cash Flows; and -the related notes 1 to 27 The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and the accounting policies directed by NHS Improvement - Independent Regulator of NHS Foundation Trusts. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the foundation trust in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council's (the 'FRC's') Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Summary of our audit approach Key audit matter The key audit matter that we identified in the current year was NHS revenue recognition. Materiality The materiality that we used in the current year was \u00a39.3m which was determined on the basis of 2% of the Trust's total revenue recognised in the 2018/19 financial year. Scoping Audit work was performed at the Trust's head offices in Chelsea directly by the audit engagement team, led by the senior statutory auditor. Significant changes in our approachThere have been no significant changes in our approach to the audit in 2018/19 compared to 2017/18.4. Annual Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2019Foreword to the Accounts The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust These accounts for the year ended 31 March 2019 have been prepared by The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust in accordance with paragraphs 24 and 25 of Schedule 7 within the National Health Service Act 2006. Cally Palmer CBE Chief Executive Officer 23 May 2019 The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19158 159Our application of materiality We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work. Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: Materiality \u00a39.3m (2018: \u00a38.6m) Basis for determining materiality2% of (2018: 2% of revenue) Rationale for the benchmark appliedRevenue was chosen as a benchmark as the Trust is a nonprofit organisation, and revenue is a key measure of financial performance for users of the financial statements. Revenu e Materiality Audit and Fina Revenue \u00a3468.6m Materiality \u00a39.3m Audit and Finance Committee reporting threshold We agreed with the Audit and Finance Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of \u00a3300k (2018: \u00a3300k), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit and Finance Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.Conclusions relating to going concern We are required by ISAs (UK) to report in respect of the following matters where: -the accounting officer's use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or -the accounting officer has not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the foundation trust's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue. We have nothing to report in respect of these matters. Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. NHS revenue recognition Key audit matter descriptionThere are significant judgements in recognition of revenue from care of NHS patients and in provisioning for disputes with commissioners due to the judgemental nature of accounting for disputes, including in respect of outstanding overperformance income for quarters 3 and 4. Details of the Trust's income, including \u00a3213.9m (2017/18: \u00a3203.0m) of Commissioner Requested Services and \u00a340.5m (2017/18: \u00a318.7m) of Provider Sustainability Funding (PSF), are shown in note 3.1 and note 3.3 to the financial statements. NHS debtors of \u00a317.1m (2017/18: \u00a321.1m) are shown in note 13.1 to the financial statements. The majority of the foundation trust's income is commissioned by NHS England. The settlement of income with Clinical Commissioning Groups continues to present challenges, leading to disputes and delays in the agreement of year end positions. How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matterWe evaluated the design and implementation of controls over recognition of NHS income. We performed detailed substantive testing on a sample basis of the recoverability of unsettled revenue amounts, and evaluated the results of the agreement of balances exercise. We challenged key judgements around specific areas of dispute and actual or potential challenge from commissioners and the rationale for the accounting treatments adopted. In doing so, we considered the historical accuracy of provisions for disputes and reviewed correspondence with commissioners. Key observations We did not identify any material misstatements through our procedures in respect of this key audit matter, and we considered the estimates made by the Trust in respect to their recognition of NHS revenue to be within an acceptable range.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19160 161Report on other legal and regulatory requirements Opinion on other matters prescribed by the National Health Service Act 2006 In our opinion: -the parts of the Directors' Remuneration Report and Staff Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the National Health Service Act 2006; and -the information given in the Performance Report and the Accountability Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. Matters on which we are required to report by exception Annual Governance Statement, use of resources, and compilation of financial statements Under the Code of Audit Practice, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: -the Annual Governance Statement does not meet the disclosure requirements set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual, is misleading, or is inconsistent with information of which we are aware from our audit; -the NHS Foundation Trust has not made proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources; or -proper practices have not been observed in the compilation of the financial statements. We are not required to consider, nor have we considered, whether the Annual Governance Statement addresses all risks and controls or that risks are satisfactorily addressed by internal controls. We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.Reports in the public interest or to the regulator Under the Code of Audit Practice, we are also required to report to you if: -any matters have been reported in the public interest under Schedule 10(3) of the National Health Service Act 2006 in the course of, or at the end of the audit; or -any reports to the regulator have been made under Schedule 10(6) of the National Health Service Act 2006 because we have reason to believe that the foundation trust, or a director or officer of the foundation trust, is about to make, or has made, a decision involving unlawful expenditure, or is about to take, or has taken, unlawful action likely to cause a loss or deficiency. We have nothing to report in respect of these matters. Certificate We certify that we have completed the audit of the accounts in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 5 of Part 2 of the National Health Service Act 2006 and the Code of Audit Practice. Use of our report This report is made solely to the Board of Governors and Board of Directors (\"the Boards\") of The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, as a body, in accordance with paragraph 4 of Schedule 10 of the National Health Service Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Boards those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the foundation trust and the Boards as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. Jonathan Gooding, FCA Senior statutory auditor For and on behalf of Deloitte LLP Statutory Auditor St Albans, United Kingdom 24 May 2019 An overview of the scope of our audit Our audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the entity and its environment, including internal control, and assessing the risks of material misstatement. Audit work was performed at the Trust's head offices in Chelsea directly by the audit engagement team, led by the audit partner. The audit team included integrated Deloitte specialists bringing specific skills and experience in property valuations and Information Technology systems. The Trust makes use of NHS Shared Service, a service organisation, for its financial processing activities. We have reviewed reports prepared by the service organisation and performed procedures on information available at the Trust. Other information The accounting officer is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.Responsibilities of accounting officer As explained more fully in the accounting officer's responsibilities statement, the accounting officer is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the accounting officer determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the accounting officer is responsible for assessing the foundation trust's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the accounting officer either intends to liquidate the foundation trust or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC's website at: www.frc.org.uk/ auditorsresponsibilities.

The GAM expands the definition of a contract to include legislation and regulations which enables an entity to receive cash or another financial asset that is not classified as a tax by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). As directed by the GAM, the transition to IFRS 15 in 2018/19 has been completed in accordance with paragraph C3 (b) of the Standard: applying the Standard retrospectively but recognising the cumulative effects at the date of initial application (1 April 2018). Revenue in respect of goods/services provided is recognised when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied by transferring promised goods/services to the customer and is measured at the amount of the transaction price allocated to those performance obligations. At the year end, the Trust accrues income relating to performance obligations satisfied in that year. Where the Trust's entitlement to consideration for those goods or services is unconditional, a contract receivable will be recognised. Where entitlement to consideration is conditional on a further factor other than the passage of time, a contract asset will be recognised. Where consideration received or receivable relates to a performance obligation that is to be satisfied in a future period, the income is deferred and recognised as a contract liability. Revenue from NHS contracts The main source of income for the Trust is contracts with commissioners for healthcare services. A performance obligation relating to delivery of a spell of healthcare is generally satisfied over time as healthcare is received and consumed simultaneously by the customer as the Trust performs it. The customer in such a contract is the commissioner, but the customer benefits as services are provided to their patient. Even where a contract could be broken down into separate performance obligations, healthcare generally aligns with paragraph 22(b) of the Standard entailing a delivery of a series of goods or services that are substantially the same and have a similar pattern of transfer. At the year end, the Trust accrues income relating to activity delivered in that year, where a patient care spell is incomplete.NHS contract revenue is recognised to the extent that collection of consideration is probable. The NHS Foundation Trust provides for expected price concessions based on the age and type of unpaid NHS contract debt. This method has been introduced during 2018/19 with percentages estimated based on historical recovery and credits notes raised. This allowance is charged to income from activities. The Trust receives income from commissioners under Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) schemes. The Trust agrees schemes with its commissioner but they affect how care is provided to patients. That is, the CQUIN payments are not considered distinct performance obligations in their own right; instead they form part of the transaction price for performance obligations under the contract. Revenue from research contracts and clinical trials Where research contracts fall under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised as and when performance obligations are satisfied. For some contracts, it is assessed that the revenue project constitutes one performance obligation over the course of the multiyear contract. In these cases it is assessed that the Trust's interim performance does not create an asset with alternative use for the Trust, and the Trust has an enforceable right to payment for the performance completed to date. It is therefore considered that the performance obligation is satisfied over time, and the Trust recognises revenue each year over the course of the contract. 1.3 Revenue grants and other contributions to expenditure Government grants are grants from government bodies other than income from commissioners or trusts for the provision of services. Where a grant is used to fund revenue expenditure it is taken to the Statement of Comprehensive Income to match that expenditure. The value of the benefit received when accessing funds from the Government's apprenticeship service is recognised as income at the point of receipt of the training service. Where these funds are paid directly to an accredited training provider, the corresponding notional expense is also recognised at the point of recognition for the benefit.1. Accounting policies NHS Improvement, in exercising the statutory functions conferred on Monitor, has directed that the financial statements of the Trust shall meet the accounting requirements of the Department of Health and Social Care Group Accounting Manual (GAM), which shall be agreed with HM Treasury. Consequently, the following financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the GAM 2018/19 issued by the Department of Health and Social Care. The accounting policies contained in the GAM follow International Financial Reporting Standards to the extent that they are meaningful and appropriate to the NHS, as determined by HM Treasury, which is advised by the Financial Reporting Advisory Board. Where the GAM permits a choice of accounting policy, the accounting policy that is judged to be most appropriate to the particular circumstances of the Trust for the purpose of giving a true and fair view has been selected. The particular policies adopted are described below. These have been applied consistently in dealing with items considered material in relation to accounts. Accounting convention These accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to account for the revaluation of property, plant and equipment. Going concern These accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis. Nontrading entities in the public sector are assumed to be going concerns where the continued provision of a service in the future is anticipated, as evidenced by inclusion of financial provision for that service in published documents. After making enquiries, the Board of Directors have a reasonable expectation that the NHS Foundation Trust has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. They have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Trust's ability to continue as a going concern. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.1.1 Consolidation NHS charitable fund The Trust is the corporate trustee to The Royal Marsden Hospital Charity (RMHC) NHS charitable fund (Charity no. 1050537). The Trust has assessed its relationship to the charitable fund and determined it to be a subsidiary because the Trust is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns and other benefits for itself, patients and staff from its involvement with the charitable fund and has the ability to affect those returns and other benefits through its power over the fund. The assets and activities of RMHC, however, were transferred to The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity (RMCC) on 1 September 2011 and the Trust has determined not to consolidate RMHC on the grounds of materiality. The RMCC (Charity no. 1095197) is a registered charity and a company limited by guarantee (Company no. 04615761) with a Board of individual trustee directors, which has a wholly owned subsidiary trading company. The RMCC is not an NHS linked charity and therefore does not fall within the definition of a subsidiary. As such, the RMCC has not been consolidated into the financial statements of the Trust. Joint ventures Joint ventures are arrangements in which the Trust has joint control with one or more other parties, and where it has the rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. The investment is initially recognised at cost. It is increased or decreased subsequently to reflect the Trust's share of the entity's profit or loss or other gains and losses (e.g. revaluation gains on the entity's property, plant and equipment) following acquisition. It is also reduced when any distribution, such as share dividends, are received by the Trust from the joint venture.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19168 169Where a large asset, for example a building, includes a number of components with significantly different asset lives, e.g. plant and equipment, then these components are treated as separate assets and depreciated over their own useful economic lives. Measurement All property, plant and equipment assets are measured initially at cost, representing the costs directly attributable to acquiring or constructing the assets and bringing them to the location and condition necessary for them to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. All assets are measured subsequently at valuation. Assets which are held for their service potential and are in use (i.e. operational assets used to deliver either frontline services or back office functions) are measured at their current value in existing use. Assets that were most recently held for their service potential but are surplus with no plan to bring them back into use are measured at fair value where there are no restrictions on sale at the reporting date and where they do not meet the definitions of investment properties or assets held for sale. All land and buildings are revalued every five years with an interim valuation in the third year, or more frequently if it is felt that the market is subject to significant volatility. Valuations are carried out by professionally qualified valuers in accordance with the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Appraisal and Valuation Manual. Valuations are carried out primarily on the basis of Modern Equivalent asset Value (MEV) for specialised operational property and fair value for nonspecialised operational property. Assets in the course of construction are valued at cost and are valued by professional valuers as part of the five or threeyearly valuation upon completion. A full land and buildings valuation was last undertaken by Montagu Evans LLP as at 31 December 2016. The next full valuation is scheduled for the financial period ending 31 March 2022. Properties in the course of construction for service or administration purposes are carried at cost, less any impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees. Assets are revalued and depreciation commences when the assets are brought into use.IT equipment, transport equipment, furniture and fittings, and plant and machinery that are held for operational use are valued at depreciated historic cost where these assets have short useful lives or low values or both, as this is not considered to be materially different from current value in existing use. Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure relating to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that additional future economic benefits or service potential deriving from the cost incurred to replace a component of such item will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the item can be determined reliably. Where a component of an asset is replaced, the cost of the replacement is capitalised if it meets the criteria for recognition above. The carrying amount of the part replaced is derecognised. Other expenditure that does not generate future economic benefits or service potential, such as repairs and maintenance, is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which it is incurred. Depreciation Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their remaining useful economic lives in a manner consistent with the consumption of economic or service delivery benefits. Freehold land is considered to have an infinite life and is not depreciated. Property, plant and equipment which have been reclassified as 'held for sale' cease to be depreciated upon the reclassification. Assets in the course of construction and residual interests in offStatement of Financial Position private finance initiative (PFI) contract assets are not depreciated until the asset is brought into use or reverts to the Trust, respectively. Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until the asset is brought into use. Buildings and dwellings are depreciated on their current value over the estimated remaining life of the asset as advised by the Trust's professional valuer (less than 1-60 years). Leaseholds are depreciated over the primary lease term.1.4 Other income Income from the sale of noncurrent assets is recognised only when all material conditions of sale have been met, and is measured as the sums due under the sale contract. 1.5 Expenditure on employee benefits Shortterm employee benefits Salaries, wages and employmentrelated payments are recognised in the period in which the service is received from employees. The cost of annual leave entitlement earned but not taken by employees at the end of the period is recognised in the financial statements to the extent that employees are permitted to carry forward leave into the following period. Pension costs NHS Pension Scheme Past and present employees are covered by the provisions of the NHS Pension Scheme. The scheme is an unfunded, defined benefit scheme that covers NHS employers, general practices and other bodies, allowed under the direction of Secretary of State, in England and Wales. It is not possible for the Trust to identify its share of the underlying scheme liabilities. Therefore, the scheme is accounted for as a defined contribution scheme. Employer pension cost contributions are charged to operating expenses as and when they become due. Additional pension liabilities arising from early retirements are not funded by the scheme except where the retirement is due to ill health. The full amount of the liability for the additional costs is charged to the operating expenses at the time the Trust commits itself to the retirement, regardless of the method of payment. National Employment Savings Scheme (NEST pension scheme) Employees of the Trust who are not eligible for the NHS Pension Scheme are automatically enrolled into NEST, a defined contribution pension scheme. The amounts charged to the income and expenditure account represent the contributions payable by the Trust during the year. Please refer to Note 5.Defined contribution plans are postemployment benefit plans under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity (a fund) and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Under defined contribution plans the entity's legal or constructive obligation is limited to the amount that it agrees to contribute to the fund. 1.6 Expenditure on other goods and services Expenditure on goods and services is recognised when, and to the extent that they have been received, and is measured at the fair value of those goods and services. Expenditure is not recognised in operating expenses where it results in the creation of noncurrent assets such as property, plant and equipment. NHS Improvement's guidance states that there should be no netting off of income and expenditure. There are a number of employees of the Trust that perform work for other organisations, who in turn reimburse the Trust for this work. The accounts show the income and expense from these arrangements under the headings 'Other income' and 'Staff costs', respectively. 1.7 Property, plant and equipment Recognition Property, plant and equipment is capitalised where: -it is held for use in delivering services or for administrative purposes -it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to, or service potential be provided to, the Trust -it is expected to be used for more than one financial year -the cost of the item can be measured reliably -the item has cost of at least \u00a35,000, or -collectively, a number of items have a cost of at least \u00a35,000 and individually have a cost of more than \u00a3250, where the assets are functionally interdependent, had broadly simultaneous purchase dates, are anticipated to have simultaneous disposal dates and are under single managerial control.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19170 171The donated and grantfunded assets are subsequently accounted for in the same manner as other items of property, plant and equipment. 1.8 Intangible fixed assets Recognition Intangible assets are nonmonetary assets without physical substance which are capable of being sold separately from the rest of the Trust's business, or which arise from contractual or other legal rights. They are recognised only where it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to, or service potential be provided to, the Trust and where the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Internally generated intangible assets Internally generated goodwill, brands, mastheads, publishing titles, customer lists and similar items are not capitalised as intangible assets. Expenditure on research is not capitalised. Expenditure on development is capitalised only where all of the following can be demonstrated: -the project is technically feasible to the point of completion and will result in an intangible asset for sale or use -the Trust intends to complete the asset and sell or use it -the Trust has the ability to sell or use the asset -how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic or service delivery benefits, e.g. the presence of a market for it or its output, or where it is to be used for internal use, the usefulness of the asset -adequate financial, technical and other resources are available to the Trust to complete the development and sell or use the asset, and -the Trust can measure reliably the expenses attributable to the asset during development. Software Software which is integral to the operation of hardware, e.g. an operating system, is capitalised as part of the relevant item of property, plant and equipment. Software which is not integral to the operation of hardware, e.g. application software, is capitalised as an intangible asset.Measurement Intangible assets are recognised initially at cost, comprising all directly attributable costs needed to create, produce and prepare the asset to the point that it is capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Subsequently intangible assets are measured at current value in existing use. Where no active market exists, intangible assets are valued at the lower of depreciated replacement cost and the value in use where the asset is income generating. Revaluations gains and losses and impairments are treated in the same manner as for property, plant and equipment. An intangible asset which is surplus with no plan to bring it back into use is valued at fair value under IFRS 13, if it does not meet the requirements of IAS 40 of IFRS 5. Intangible assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or 'fair value less costs to sell'. Amortisation Intangible assets are amortised over their expected useful life in a manner consistent with the consumption of economic or service delivery benefits. Useful economic lives reflect the total life of an asset and not the remaining life of an asset. The range of useful economic lives is shown below: Software licences 5 years straight line 1.9 Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is measured using the First In, First Out (FIFO) method. 1.10 Financial assets and financial liabilities Recognition Financial assets and financial liabilities arise where the NHS Foundation Trust is party to the contractual provisions of a financial instrument, and, as a result, has a legal right to receive or a legal obligation to pay cash or another financial instrument. The GAM expands the definition of a contract to include legislation and regulations which give rise to arrangements that in all other respects would be a financial instrument and do not give rise to transactions classified as a tax by the ONS.Equipment is depreciated on cost, including historic indexation, evenly over the estimated remaining life of the asset. These are estimated as follows: Plant and machinery 5-15 years straight line Transport equipment 7 years straight line Information technology 5-10 years straight line Furniture and fittings 10 years straight line Revaluation gains and losses Revaluation gains are recognised in the revaluation reserve, except where, and to the extent that, they reverse a revaluation decrease that has previously been recognised in operating expenses, in which case they are recognised in operating income. Revaluation losses are charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is an available balance for the asset concerned, and thereafter are charged to operating expenses. Gains and losses recognised in the revaluation reserve are reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as an item of 'Other comprehensive income'. Impairments In accordance with the GAM, impairments that arise from a clear consumption of economic benefits or of service potential in the asset are charged to operating expenses. A compensating transfer is made from the revaluation reserve to the income and expenditure reserve of an amount equal to the lower of: (i) the impairment charged to operating expenses; and (ii) the balance in the revaluation reserve attributable to that asset before the impairment. An impairment arising from a loss of economic benefit or service potential is reversed when, and to the extent that, the circumstances that gave rise to the loss are reversed. Reversals are netted off operating expenditure to the extent that the asset is restored to the carrying amount it would have had if the impairment had never been recognised. Any remaining reversal is recognised in the revaluation reserve. Where, at the time of the original impairment, a transfer was made from the revaluation reserve to the income and expenditure reserve, an amount is transferred back to the revaluation reserve when the impairment reversal is recognised.Other impairments are treated as revaluation losses. Reversals of 'other impairments' are treated as revaluation gains. Derecognition Assets intended for disposal are reclassified as 'held for sale' once all of the following criteria are met: -the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms which are usual and customary for such sales -the sale must be highly probable i.e.: -management are committed to a plan to sell the asset -an active programme has begun to find a buyer and complete the sale -the asset is being actively marketed at a reasonable price -the sale is expected to be completed within 12 months of the date of classification as 'held for sale', and -the actions needed to complete the plan indicate it is unlikely that the plan will be dropped or significant changes made to it. Following reclassification, the assets are measured at the lower of their existing carrying amount and their 'fair value less costs to sell'. Depreciation ceases to be charged. Assets are derecognised when all material sale contract conditions have been met. Property, plant and equipment which is to be scrapped or demolished does not qualify for recognition as 'held for sale' and instead is retained as an operational asset and the asset's economic life is adjusted. The asset is derecognised when scrapping or demolition occurs. Donated, government grant and other grantfunded assets Donated and grantfunded property, plant and equipment assets are capitalised at their fair value on receipt. The donation/grant is credited to income at the same time, unless the donor has imposed a condition that the future economic benefits embodied in the grant are to be consumed in a manner specified by the donor, in which case, the donation/grant is deferred within liabilities and is carried forward to future financial years to the extent that the condition has not yet been met.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19172 173For financial assets that have become credit impaired since initial recognition (stage 3), expected credit losses at the reporting date are measured as the difference between the asset's gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate. Expected losses are charged to operating expenditure within the Statement of Comprehensive Income and reduce the net carrying value of the financial asset in the Statement of Financial Position. Derecognition All financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or the Trust has transferred substantially all of the risk and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires. 1.11 Cash and cash equivalents Cash, bank and overdraft balances are recorded at the current values of these balances in the Trust's cash book. Overdrafts are disclosed within creditors. Interest earned on bank accounts and interest charged on overdrafts is recorded as, respectively, 'finance income' and 'finance expenses' in the periods to which they relate. Bank charges are recorded as operating expenditure in the periods to which they relate. 1.12 Leases Finance leases Where substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of a leased asset are borne by the NHS Foundation Trust, the asset is recorded as property, plant and equipment and a corresponding liability is recorded. The value at which both are recognised is the lower of the fair value of the asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. The asset and liability are recognised at the commencement of the lease. Thereafter the asset is accounted for as an item of property plant and equipment.The annual rental is split between the repayment of the liability and a finance cost so as to achieve a constant rate of finance over the life of the lease. The annual finance cost is charged to Finance Costs in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. The lease liability is derecognised when the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. Operating leases Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straightline basis over the lease term. Lease incentives are recognised initially as a liability and subsequently as a reduction of rentals on a straightline basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. Leases of land and buildings Where a lease is for land and buildings, the land component is separated from the building component and the classification for each is assessed separately. 1.13 Provisions The Trust recognises a provision where it has a present legal or constructive obligation of uncertain timing or amount; for which it is probable that there will be a future outflow of cash or other resources; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount. The amount recognised in the Statement of Financial Position is the best estimate of the resources required to settle the obligation. Where the effect of the time value of money is significant, the estimated riskadjusted cash flows are discounted using the discount rates published and mandated by HM Treasury. Clinical negligence costs NHS Resolution operates a risk pooling scheme under which the Trust pays an annual contribution to NHS Resolution, which, in return, settles all clinical negligence claims. Although NHS Resolution is administratively responsible for all clinical negligence cases, the legal liability remains with the NHS Foundation Trust. The total value of clinical negligence provisions carried by NHS Resolution on behalf of the Trust is disclosed at note 16.1, but is not recognised in the Trust's accounts.This includes the purchase or sale of nonfinancial items (such as goods or services), which are entered into in accordance with the Trust's normal purchase, sale or usage requirements, and are recognised when, and to the extent which, performance occurs, i.e. when receipt or delivery of the goods or services is made. Classification and measurement Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value plus or minus directly attributable transaction costs, except where the asset or liability is not measured at fair value through income and expenditure. Fair value is taken as the transaction price, or otherwise determined by reference to quoted market prices or valuation techniques. Financial assets or financial liabilities in respect of assets acquired or disposed of through finance leases are recognised and measured in accordance with the accounting policy for leases described below. Financial assets are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost or fair value through income and expenditure. Financial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost or fair value through income and expenditure. Financial assets and financial liabilities at amortised cost Financial assets and financial liabilities at amortised cost are those held with the objective of collecting contractual cash flows and where cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest. This includes cash equivalents, contract and other receivables, trade and other payables, rights and obligations under lease arrangements, and loans receivable and payable. After initial recognition, these financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment (for financial assets). The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability.Interest revenue or expense is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or amortised cost of a financial liability and recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and a financing income or expense. In the case of loans held from the Department of Health and Social Care, the effective interest rate is the nominal rate of interest charged on the loan. Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through income and expenditure Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are those that are not otherwise measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. This category also includes financial assets and liabilities acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term (held for trading) and derivatives. Derivatives which are embedded in other contracts, but which are separable from the host contract, are measured within this category. Movements in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities in this category are recognised as gains or losses in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Impairment of financial assets For all financial assets measured at amortised cost, including lease receivables, contract receivables and contract assets, the Trust recognises an allowance for expected credit losses. The Trust adopts the simplified approach to impairment for contract and other receivables, contract assets and lease receivables, measuring expected losses as at an amount equal to lifetime expected losses. For other financial assets, the loss allowance is initially measured at an amount equal to 12month expected credit losses (stage 1) and subsequently at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk assessed for the financial asset significantly increases (stage 2). The Trust provides for expected credit losses based on the age and type of each debt. The percentages applied reflect an assessment of the recoverability of each class of debt. During 2018/19, the method was reviewed and the percentages amended based on historical recovery and writeoff levels. Provisions are charged to operating expenditure.The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19174 1751.18 Foreign exchange The functional and presentational currency of the Trust is sterling. A transaction which is denominated in a foreign currency is translated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. 1.19 Third party assets Assets belonging to third parties (such as money held on behalf of patients) are not recognised in the accounts since the Trust has no beneficial interest in them. However, they are disclosed in a separate note (note 24) to the accounts in accordance with the requirement of HM Treasury's Financial Reporting Manual. 1.20 Critical judgements in applying accounting policies In the application of the Trust's accounting policies, management is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and the estimates and underlying assumptions are continually reviewed. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. 1.21 Sources of estimation uncertainty The key areas of estimation and judgement used in the preparation of the accounts have been disclosed within other sections of the accounting policy notes. These include provisions for impairment of receivables (note 1.10), estimates of partially complete patient episodes (note 1.2), provisions (note 1.13), valuation of land and buildings (note 1.7), and depreciation rates applied to property, plant and equipment (note 1.7). 1.22 Losses and special payments Losses and special payments are items that Parliament would not have contemplated when it agreed funds for the health service or passed legislation. By their nature, they are items that ideally should not arise. They are therefore subject to special control procedures compared with the generality of payments. They are divided into different categories, which govern the way that individual cases are handled. Losses and special payments are charged to the relevant functional headings in expenditure on an accruals basis, including losses which would have been made good through insurance cover had trusts not been bearing their own risks (with insurance premiums then being included as normal revenue expenditure). The losses and special payments note (note 20.2) is compiled directly from the losses and compensations register, which reports on an accrual basis with the exception of provisions for future losses. 1.23 Early adoption of standards, amendments and interpretation No new accounting standards or revisions to existing standards have been early adopted in 2018/19. 1.24 Accounting standards that have been issued but have not yet been adopted The GAM does not require the following standards and interpretations to be applied in 2018/19. These standards are still subject to HM Treasury FReM adoption, with the government implementation date for IFRS 16 being 2020/21. IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts Not yet EUendorsed. Applies to firsttime adopters of IFRS after 1 January 2016. Therefore not applicable to Department of Health and Social Care group bodies. The adoption of IFRS 14 is not considered material to the Trust. IFRS 16 Leases Application required for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2020, but not yet adopted by the FReM: early adoption is not therefore permitted. Work is underway to assess the impact of IFRS 16 Leases. IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts Application required for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021, but not yet adopted by the FReM: early adoption is not therefore permitted. The adoption of IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts is not considered material to the Trust. IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments Application required for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The impact of IFRIC 23 is not considered material to the Trust.Nonclinical risk pooling The Trust participates in the Property Expenses Scheme and the Liabilities to Third Parties Scheme. Both are risk pooling schemes under which the Trust pays an annual contribution to NHS Resolution and in return receives assistance with the costs of claims arising. The annual membership contributions, and any 'excesses' payable in respect of particular claims, are charged to operating expenses when the liability arises. Other insurance The Trust holds commercial insurance for a range of risks in excess of those covered by the nonclinical risk pooling scheme. This includes cover for property damage and increased costs of working. 1.14 Contingencies Contingent assets (that is, assets arising from past events whose existence will only be confirmed by one or more future events not wholly within the entity's control) are not recognised as assets, but are disclosed in note 19 where an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent liabilities are not recognised, but are disclosed in note 19, unless the probability of a transfer of economic benefits is remote. Contingent liabilities are defined as: -possible obligations arising from past events whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the entity's control, or -present obligations arising from past events but for which it is not probable that a transfer of economic benefits will arise, or for which the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. 1.15 Public dividend capital Public dividend capital (PDC) is a type of public sector equity finance based on the excess of assets over liabilities at the time of establishment of the predecessor NHS Trust. HM Treasury has determined that PDC is not a financial instrument within the meaning of IAS 32.At any time, the Secretary of State can issue new PDC to, and require repayments of PDC from, the Trust. PDC is recorded at the value received. A charge, reflecting the cost of capital utilised by the Trust, is payable as public dividend capital dividend. The charge is calculated at the rate set by HM Treasury (currently 3.5%) on the average relevant net assets of the Trust during the financial year. Relevant net assets are calculated as the value of all assets less the value of all liabilities except for: (i) donated assets (including lottery funded assets) (ii) average daily cash balances held with the Government Banking Services (GBS) and National Loans Fund (NLF) deposits, excluding cash balances held in GBS accounts that relate to a shortterm working capital facility, and (iii) any PDC dividend balance receivable or payable. In accordance with the requirements laid down by the Department of Health and Social Care (as the issuer of PDC), the dividend for the year is calculated on the actual average relevant net assets as set out in the 'preaudit' version of the annual accounts. The dividend thus calculated is not revised should any adjustment to net assets occur as a result the audit of the annual accounts. 1.16 Value added tax (VAT) Most of the activities of the Trust are outside the scope of VAT and, in general, output tax does not apply and input tax on purchases is not recoverable. Irrecoverable VAT is charged to the relevant expenditure category or included in the capitalised purchase cost of fixed assets. Where output tax is charged or input VAT is recoverable, the amounts are stated net of VAT. 1.17 Corporation Tax Health service bodies, including foundation trusts, are exempt from tax on their principal healthcare income. The Trust has determined that there is no corporation tax liability due for 2018/19 (2017/18 Nil).The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19176 1773.2 Analysis of income from activities by outpatient income 34,042 30,368 High cost drugs income from commissioners (excluding passthrough costs)13,715 13,818 Other types of activity patient income 121,312 income 2018/19 \u00a3000 Other operating income from contracts with customers: Commercial trials income 14,043 12,533 Education and training 5,571 9,182 Nonpatient care services to other bodies 9,011 7,951 Services provided to associated charities 2,913 2,773 Hosted IT services 941 2,181 Car parking 647 605 Catering 1,548 1,519 Salaries and wages recharged to other organisations Provider sustainability/sustainability and income (PSF/STF)40,460 Other contract income 8,172 9,088 Other noncontract operating and development 13,502 14,084 Royal Marsden Partners 10,552 employed 289,965 223,239 The Trust has only one segment of business, which is the provision of healthcare. The segment has been identified with reference to how the Trust is organised and the way in which the chief operating decision maker (determined to be the Board of Directors) runs the Trust. The geographical and regulatory environment and the nature of services provided are consistent across the organisation and are therefore presented in one segment. The necessary information to develop detailed income and expenditure for each product and service provided by the Trust is currently not discretely available and the cost to develop this information would be excessive. Significant amounts of income are received from transactions with the Department of Health and Social Care and other NHS bodies. Disclosure of all material transactions with related parties is included in note 22 to these financial statements. There are no other parties that account for more than 10 per cent of total income. 3.

The midpoint of the banded remuneration of the highestpaid director in the Trust in the financial year 2018/19 was \u00a3267,500 (2017/18: \u00a3257,500). This was 7.16 (2017/18: 7.0) times the median remuneration of the workforce, which was \u00a337,345 (2017/18: \u00a336,793). The median has been calculated to include inner London weighting, as the highest paid director is Londonbased. Total remuneration includes salary, nonconsolidated performancerelated pay and benefitsinkind as well as severance payments. It does not include employer pension contributions and the cash equivalent transfer value of pensions. 5.4 Retirement due to ill health During 2018/19 there was one early retirement from the Trust agreed on the grounds of ill health (2017/18: three). The estimated additional pension liability of this ill health retirement will be \u00a337,972 (2017/18: \u00a3293,669).

Pension costs Past and present employees are covered by the provisions of the two NHS Pension Schemes. Details of the benefits payable and rules of the Schemes can be found on the NHS Pensions website at: www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pensions. Both are unfunded defined benefit schemes that cover NHS employers, GP practices and other bodies, allowed under the direction of the Secretary of State for Health in England and Wales. They are not designed to be run in a way that would enable NHS bodies to identify their share of the underlying scheme assets and liabilities. Therefore, each scheme is accounted for as if it were a defined contribution scheme: the cost to the NHS body of participating in each scheme is taken as equal to the contributions payable to that scheme for the accounting period. In order that the defined benefit obligations recognised in the financial statements do not differ materially from those that would be determined at the reporting date by a formal actuarial valuation, the FReM requires that 'the period between formal valuations shall be four years, with approximate assessments in intervening years'. An outline of these follows: a. Accounting valuation A valuation of scheme liability is carried out annually by the scheme actuary (currently the Government Actuary's Department) as at the end of the reporting period. This utilises an actuarial assessment for the previous accounting period in conjunction with updated membership and financial data for the current reporting period, and is accepted as providing suitably robust figures for financial reporting purposes. The valuation of the scheme liability as at 31 March 2019 is based on valuation data as 31 March 2018, updated to 31 March 2019 with summary global member and accounting data. In undertaking this actuarial assessment, the methodology prescribed in IAS 19, relevant FReM interpretations, and the discount rate prescribed by HM Treasury have also been used. The latest assessment of the liabilities of the scheme is contained in the report of the scheme actuary, which forms part of the annual NHS Pension Scheme Accounts. These accounts can be viewed on the NHS Pensions website and are published annually. Copies can also be obtained from The Stationery Office. b. Full actuarial (funding) valuation The purpose of this valuation is to assess the level of liability in respect of the benefits due under the schemes (taking into account recent demographic experience), and to recommend contribution rates payable by employees and employers. The latest actuarial valuation undertaken for the NHS Pension Scheme was completed as at 31 March 2016. The results of this valuation set the employer contribution rate payable from April 2019. The Department of Health and Social Care has recently laid scheme regulations confirming that the employer contribution rate will increase to 20.6 per cent of pensionable pay from this date. The 2016 funding valuation was also expected to test the cost of the scheme relative to the employer cost cap set following the 2012 valuation. Following a judgment from the Court of Appeal in December 2018, the government announced a pause to that part of the valuation process, pending conclusion of the continuing legal process.19. Contingencies There are no contingent assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date (2017/18: Nil). 20. Financial performance targets 20.1 Public dividend capital (PDC) The Trust is required to demonstrate that the PDC dividend paid is in line with the actual rate of 3.5 per cent of average relevant net assets. The actual dividend rate is the dividend payable figure in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, \u00a33,286,424 (2017/18: \u00a33,643,644), divided by the average of relevant opening and closing net assets, \u00a393,897,828 (2017/18: \u00a3104,134,059), expressed as a percentage. This gives an actual dividend rate for 2018/19 of 3.5 per cent (2017/18: 3.5 per cent). 20.2 Losses and special payments There were 607 cases of losses and special payments (2017/18: 378) totalling \u00a3738,162 (2017/18: \u00a3886,145). Losses and special payments are reported on an accrual basis. Provisions for future losses are reported in note 16 and are excluded from this disclosure. There were no clinical negligence, fraud, personal injury, compensation under legal obligation or fruitless payment cases where the net payment exceeded \u00a3300,000 Losses of cash due to: Salary overpayments 33 25 13 9 Bad debts and claims abandoned in relation to private patients536 538 308 740 Bad debts and claims abandoned in relation to overseas visitors4 142 11 132 Bad debts and claims abandoned in relation to other34 33 46 5 607 738 378 886 Special payments: Special severance payments Other Total losses and special payments 607 738 378 886 Of which, cases of \u00a3250,000 or more: The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19192 193The Trust has entered into the following material transactions with related parties: Income 2018/19 Charity 21,523 Department of Health and Social Care 15,327 Health 1,109 299,17422. Related party transactions The Trust is a public benefit corporation and has been authorised pursuant to Section 6 of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003. The Department of Health and Social Care is the Trust's parent department.

Financial instruments IFRS 7 requires disclosure of the role that financial instruments have had during the period in creating or changing the risks an entity faces in undertaking its activities. The Trust does not have any complex financial instruments and does not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Because of the continuing service provider relationship the Trust has with NHS England and CCGs, and the way that NHS England and CCGs are financed, the Trust is not exposed to the degree of financial risk faced by business entities. Financial instruments play a much more limited role in creating or changing risk than would be typical of the listed companies to which IFRS 7 mainly applies. The Trust has limited powers to borrow or invest surplus funds, and financial assets and liabilities are generated by daytoday operational activities rather than being held to change the risks facing the Trust in undertaking its activities. The Trust's financial instruments comprise loans, finance lease obligations, provisions, cash at bank and in hand and various items, such as trade debtors and trade creditors, that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Trust's operations. 23.1 Categories of financial instruments 2018/19 2017/18 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Financial assets Loans and receivables (including cash) 194,466 134,496 Financial liabilities Other financial liabilities (amortised cost) 84,282 87,908 23.2 Fair values 31 March 201931 March 201931 March 201831 March 2018 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value \u00a3000 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Financial liabilities Provision under contract (493) (493) (41) (41) As allowed by IFRS 7, shortterm trade debtors and creditors measured at amortised cost may be excluded from the above disclosure as their book values reasonably approximate their fair values.Receivables 2018/19 \u00a3000 NHS England Helier Hospitals NHS Trust Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust 1,204 2,938 7,673The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19198 19927. Initial application of IFRS 15 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as interpreted and adapted by the GAM, has been applied by the Trust from 1 April 2018. The standard is applied retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initial application recognised as an adjustment to the income and expenditure reserve on 1 April 2018. IFRS 15 introduces a new model for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers replacing the previous standards IAS 11, IAS 18 and related interpretations. The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity recognises revenue when it satisfies performance obligations through the transfer of promised goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. As directed by the GAM, the Trust has applied the practical expedient offered in C7A of the standard removing the need to retrospectively restate any contract modifications that occurred before the date of implementation (1 April 2018). The initial application of IFRS had no material impact for the Trust.23.3 Liquidity and interest risk tables Weighted average interest rate %Less than 1 yearTotal \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Financial assets rate instrument 0.25% 78,164 78,164 Gross financial assets at 31 March 2019 194,465 194,465 Noninterest bearing 87,234 87,234 Variable interest rate instrument 0.25% 47,262 47,262 Gross financial assets at 31 March 2018 134,496 134,496 23.4 Credit risk Because the majority of the Trust's revenue comes from contracts with other public sector bodies, the Trust has low exposure to credit risk. The maximum exposures as at 31 March 2019 are in receivables from customers, as disclosed in the trade and other receivables note. Trade and other receivables outstanding not past due are considered recoverable and are not impaired. 24. Third party assets The Trust held nil cash at bank and negligible cash in hand at 31 March 2019 (31 March 2018: nil) which relates to monies held by the Trust on behalf of patients. 25. Events after the reporting period There have been no material events after the reporting period. 26. Initial application of IFRS 9 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, as interpreted and adapted by the GAM, has been applied by the Trust from 1 April 2018. The standard is applied retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initial application recognised as an adjustment to reserves on 1 April 2018. IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 and introduces a revised approach to classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, a new forwardlooking 'expected loss' impairment model and a revised approach to hedge accounting. Under IFRS 9, borrowings from the Department of Health and Social Care, which were previously held at historic cost, are measured on an amortised cost basis. Consequently, on 1 April 2018, borrowings increased by \u00a321,483, and trade payables correspondingly reduced. Reassessment of allowances for credit losses under the expected loss model resulted in no change in the carrying value of receivables.Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19CThe Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust 200Life demands excellence At The Royal Marsden, we deal with cancer every day so we understand how valuable life is. And when people entrust their lives to us, they have the right to demand the very best. That's why the pursuit of excellence lies at the heart of everything we do. No matter what we achieve, we're always striving to do more. No matter how much we exceed expectations, we believe we can exceed them still further. We will never stop looking for ways to improve the lives of people affected by cancer. This attitude defines us all, and is an inseparable part of the way we work. It's The Royal Marsden way.
