Mapungubwe is believed to be one of the first states in Southern Africa. Hailed as the centre of the largest kingdom on the sub-continent, where, in ancient times, a highly sophisticated civilisation conducted trade with various other populations such as China, India and Egypt. The origins of Mapungubwe Cultural Landscape can be traced back 1 100 years. The University of Pretoria exhumed the remains of inhabitants of this ancient society for research purposes. In line with the National Heritage Resources Act 25 (1999), which facilitates repatriation of human remains, the Lemba Cultural Association, Leshiba Royal Family, Machete Royal Family, San Council, Tshivhula Royal Council and Vhangona Cultural Movement have claimed the human remains of the inhabitants of Mapungubwe. On 29 October 2007, the Universities of Pretoria and the Witwatersrand as well as the National Flagship Institution released these remains to the bona fide descendants of Mapungubwe. Starting with sacred ceremonies on 5 November 2007, traditional activities were concluded with a Cleansing and Healing Ceremony including the return of the spirits to Mapungubwe that took place on 6 November 2007. The Deputy Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, Rejoice Mabudafhasi described this event \"as a dignified return of the spirits of the Mapungubwe ancestors to their home where they will rest in peace. This is a very public acknowledgement of the moral case for the return of the remains and spirits of the Mapungubwe ancestors thus honouring the traditions of communities and demonstrating the generosity of spirit that this process required of all of us.\" According to Mongane Wally Serote, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of The Freedom Park Trust, repatriation and reburial are organically linked to cleansing, healing and return of the spirits. Since its inception, The Freedom Park Trust has initiated a number of cleansing and healing ceremonies, nationally as well as in Botswana, Swaziland, Mozambique, Tanzania, the United States of America and Namibia, to assist the South African nation in the process of forgiveness, reconciliation and moving forward as a united nation. Serote explains that throughout the world it is common practice that when people die, they are normally buried at home or somewhere that the family members have access to. \"Where individuals die on battlefields or where it is impossible to physically bring remains home, Africans traditionally bring them back home, so that they are integrated with a pool of ancestors who will look after the living. Failure to bring these spirits home renders it impossible for the particular families to integrate their loved ones with their ancestors and thus prevents a sense of closure in that family.\" \"Cleansing and healing cuts across beliefs, traditions, customs and culture in the African continent. As such, the ceremony will allow different groups to perform rituals according to their belief system. A space will also be identified for descendents to intercede once the ceremonies have been concluded.\" When delivering a keynote address at this ceremony, the MEC for Sports, Arts and Culture in Limpopo, Joyce Mashamba remarked that \"this cleansing ceremony once again confirms the role of traditional healers and elderly people as mediators between communities and their ancestors. This occasion reaffirms the value of ubuntu in our societies - the willingness to be of service to others and be the promoter of peace and harmony in the community.\" The Freedom Park will open its doors for public visitation in late November 2007.
