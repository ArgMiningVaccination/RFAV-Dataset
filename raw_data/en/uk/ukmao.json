So, many aspects must be considered when buying indoor herb pots. 1. Size of the Pot The ideal pot size for any plant primarily depends on the type of plant you're growing. The pot should be large enough to accommodate the plant's root system but not so big that it takes up too much space. That said, larger herbs like rosemary or basil demand a bigger-sized pot of at least 12 inches across and 10 inches deep, as smaller pots can cause plants to be root-bound and growth is restricted. When selecting a pot for [repotting your herbs](https://plantscraze.com/repotting-indoor-herbs/), ensure it has drainage holes to prevent water from accumulating in the soil and potentially causing root rot. 2. Material of the Pot The market has a wide spread of pots and planters to choose from, but select the pot that suffices your conditions. Alternatively, you can use a plastic pot, beautiful and cost-effective, for herbs that prefer moist substrate. These are super light and easy to handle as well. The only downside to plastic pots is their fragile nature which questions their durability. Further, metal pots can be another option for indoor herbs, as they are both sturdy and long-lasting. However, if exposed to direct sunlight for an extended period, the metal can get quite hot, causing the soil temperature to rise and eventually damaging the roots of your herbs. 3. Drainage Holes Stagnant water is a big No for your herbs as it invites fungal disease and root rot. Essentially, safe pots for indoor herbs must have a few drain holes to release the excess water. If your planter lacks some, drill a few. Further, when the water moves out slowly, put a few stones to the bottom of the container so that the roots of your herb aren't submerged in water. 4. Design & Appearance Choosing a pot that complements your home decor can help make your indoor herb garden a visually appealing addition to your home. Further, you can design and create one-of-a-kind herb planters by repurposing and transforming any unused home items. Voila, your planter is ready. Note: You can also decorate the outside of the can with paint, fabric, or washi tape to add some visual interest. Just make sure any materials you use to decorate are safe for use with plants.
