Includes my favorite probiotic, sleep supplement, cbd supplement, recommended vitamins and minerals, and more. When I was a kid, one of my friends got to take Fred Flintstone vitamins every day and I was actually kind of jealous. We didn't do vitamins at our house, except for the sour tasting Vitamin C tablets we got when we were sick. Many years later (ok many decades later!), I have a daily supplement routine that works to help keep me movin & groovin through my busy, happy life. Even though I didn't grow up with supplements, I've learned how certain vitamins, minerals and other supplements can help me feel good, stay healthy and operate at my best capacity. (Note: I am not a health professional and do not provide medical advice. Please talk to your trusted medical professional before starting any new supplements.)

My daily supplements are exactly that.....SUPPLEMENTS to the healthy food, the daily exercise, and the quality sleep I prioritize in my life. As a busy mom and entrepreneur, I have no time for feeling crappy! I use supplements to help keep me feeling my best so I can be the best mom, wife, friend, employer and educator that I can possibly be! Here are some of the things that I'm looking for in daily supplements: - keep my immune system functioning at its best - fight off inflammation - maintain energy throughout the day - keep things \"regular\" - maintain good gut health - support heathy bones - help boost my mood - support quality sleep The Supplements I Take Daily I may receive commissions from purchases made through links in this article including Amazon Affiliates.
