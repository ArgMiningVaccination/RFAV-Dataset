No Classification of Proposed AO (To the AAOS, to the RA or Other) AAOS WHEREAS: Now more than ever, there is a broader respon sibility of orthopedic surgeons to advocate for their patients and profession, promo ting and advancing access, quality and musculoskeletal healthcare delivery on a larger scale. To effectivel y advocate for patients and the future of orthopaedic care, all orthop aedic surgeons must have a voice in policy discussions that dictate the way we provide care for our patients. 1 WHEREAS: The AAOS Orthopaedic PAC has already demo nstrated strong commitment to provide programming geared toward re sidents, including the Annual Resident Leadership Reception at AAOS, Annual PAC Residency Ch allenge, Milestones Program, Future's Capitol Club, and various networking opportun ities. Investigating avenues for further involvement in the AAOS PAC w ill teach residents and fellows first-hand the tremendous impact of advocacy on shaping and promoting orthopedic-related po licies and regulation and facilitating change for the greater good. H ealthcare advocacy is no t only critical for patient care and healthcare acc ess, but for the continued ec onomic viability of medical practice.2 WHEREAS: Over the past 5 years, reside nt involvement in the AAOS PAC has continued to increase. Orthopaedic residents have shown their inte rest in advocacy by attending webinars, participating in developing articles a nd advisory opinions, and increasing contributions to the PAC. 2019 served as a reco rd year for resident participation within the Orthopaedic PAC with our most ever re sidents and programs participating, highest dollar amount raised, and most residenc y programs reachin g 100% participation, with Resident Assembly Advisory Opinion #2 Revised: 11.15.20 over 400 residents from 74 differe nt residency programs acro ss the country joining the Orthopaedic PAC. Additionally, 53 resident s demonstrated the highest level of commitment and join the Futures Capital Club - the largest ever. 3 Now, therefore, be it resolved: RESOLVED A: In conjunction with the Health Policy Co mmittee of the Resident Assembly, the AAOS consider investigating increas ed resident and fellow i nvolvement in the AAOS PAC, which may include the following: Increased representation of residents and/or those in fellowship by including an individual from the Resident Assembly as a voting member on the Orthopaedic PAC Executive Committee. Increased programming of PAC functions ge ared toward residents and those in fellowship. 1 Davis, Importance of Advocacy from the Orthopedic Surgeon; Orthop Clin North Am . 2021 Jan;52(1):77-82. 2 Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Assuring the Hea lth of the Public in the 21st Century.

INTRODUCTION Physicians are trained rst and foremost to take care of the patient, put their interests above all else, and do so with a code of ethics that bondsthe physician to the patient. It is this bond that allows physicians to earn and keep the patient's trust. There is no doubt that all of the physiciansreading this enact these principles on a daily ba- sis as the profession has done for centuries. Over the years, some physicians have taken the re-sponsibility of this private relationship to amore public setting in which they have used their knowledge and expertise to guide and advise on broader policies that affect health care. Fromthe beginning of the nation, individual physicians have been involved with the political process; however, it has not been until more recentlythat physician groups have bonded together as advocates to achieve common goals in the polit- ical process. This article highlights the history ofmedical advocacy and orthopedic advocacy in particular, reviews recent achievements made through orthopedic advocacy efforts, andprovides tips on getting involved with advocacy efforts. HISTORY OF MEDICAL ADVOCACY As far back as Hippocrates there is discussion of the physician being an advocate for the patient. In the nineteenth century, Virchow emphasizedthe intersection of physicians and the political process. Virchow, who was a pioneer in medicine in recognizing the state of disease as anabnormal reaction of cells from their normal pro- cesses, also equated the demonstration of that disease in the individual to be a reflection ofthe population on a whole and the health of a society. 1In other words, the health and state of individuals affect the health and state of themasses and vice versa. Thus, he emphasizedthe political forces that could alter society as the whole could help to improve the health of individuals. This intersection of the political process and health remained mostly in the public health sector for many decades.

Before the passage of theselandmark pieces of legislation health care deliv- ery and payments were largely focused between the doctor and the patient. It was not until post-World War II in the 1950s that employer- sponsored health insurance became more popu- lar. This development led President Johnson tointroduce government-sponsored insurance in the forms of Medicare and Medicaid to provide health coverage for the elderly and the impover-ished, respectively. These plans were met with great resistance from the American Medical As- sociation, which was one of the rst examples ofa large medical group getting involved in thepolitical process through advocacy. 2 Since the 1960s, involvement of the govern- ment in the health care delivery process hasonly grown. This growth led to the necessity for continued and increasing involvement of physicians and their specialty societies in the po-litical process locally and nationally. Today, virtu- ally every medical specialty and many subspecialties are involved in political advocacy.Topics range broadly among all physiciangroups but are largely focused on patients' ac- cess to care and the physician's ability to provide that care in the best way possible. The American Academy of Orthopeadic Sur- geons (AAOS) was founded in 1933 to represent those physicians who dealt with the musculoskel-etal care of patients, to advocate on behalf of those patients, to provide continued education for physicians, and educate the public aboutprevention and treatment of musculoskeletal in- juries. As it became evident that direct involve- ment of physicians and their interest groups inthe political process was needed, the AAOScreated the American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons along with the Orthopedic Political Ac- tion Committee (Orthopedic PAC) in the late1990s. Today the AAOS and the Orthopedic PAC support and promote those issues that are important to the orthopedic community onthe whole. This is done by supporting legislation and politicians who promote policies that help orthopedic surgeons take care of their patientsin the best way possible. ORTHOPEDIC ADVOCACY PROCESS The Orthopedic PAC is led by a Committee ofrepresentatives from the AAOS Board of Spe-cialty Societies and selected by the AAOS Com-mittee on Committees. This larger committee isthen further directed by the Orthopedic PAC Ex- ecutive Committee and the Orthopedic PAC chair who help to guide policy decisions of theOrthopedic PAC. The most notable of the deci-sions are to develop and promote legislation that is important to orthopedic surgeons and providers of musculoskeletal care. The Orthope-dic PAC Chair and Executive Committee report on an annual basis to the AAOS Board of Direc- tors on the activities of the PAC. Finally, theAAOS Orthopedic PAC daily activities are managed out of Washington, DC, by a team of professionals with many years of experienceworking with politicians and their staffers through the AAOS Ofce of Government Rela- tions (OGR). This team helps coordinate ef-forts between the Orthopedic PAC ExecutiveCommittee and AAOS members with members of Congress. 3 There are many ways the orthopedic surgeon can get involved in political advocacy and many good reasons to do so. Although the AAOS has a solid structure in place for political advocacyon the federal level, the interested orthopedic surgeon must also remember opportunities for advocacy on the state level. State orthopedic so-cieties are generally well organized and con-nected to help the orthopedic surgeon with an interest in advocacy. The basic levels of political involvement in any realm moving from least to most involved are: nonvoter (no involvement), voter, donor, campaigner. For those reading this article, onewould assume that there is at least level of involvement through voting and a further inter- est involvement of political persuasion throughadvocacy. As orthopedic physicians with an inti- mate knowledge of the issues that matter to us most, building personal relationships with politi-cians or their staff is an effective method ofadvocating for change. To be able to get to the level of that type of relationship, one must climb the political pyramid, as described by DrJohn Gill, Orthopedic PAC Chair, in his 2010 AAOS Now article. 4As Dr Gill points out, campaign contributions are a necessary evil inthe political process, especially in these times of unlimited dollars able to be raised by super PACs on the national level. However, bydonating to a political campaign that donor ex-erts more influence than 99.9% of eligible voters in their district (in terms of US Representatives). Therefore, the easiest and most passive way ofgetting involved is simply to donate. This is done individually to campaigns or by donating to state PAC or the AAOS Orthopedic PAC,which then use those dollars to support a broadDavis 78range of campaigns. Donations to the PAC from orthopedic surgeons have traditionally been low, but have been growing through the pastdecade. According to the Orthopedic PACAnnual Report in 2019, there was 18% participa- tion of practicing orthopedic surgeons with a stated goal of increasing that number to 30%by 2020. 5In a prospective survey study of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons in 2019 by Abboud and colleagues,6254 respon- dents reported that 110 (43%) members had donated to the Orthopedic PAC in the past year. Furthermore, 220 (87%) were willing tobecome more involved by being a key contact person or forming a relationship with a legislator. 6 The next and highest level of involvement is with actively campaigning or meeting directly with local and federal representatives. This is done in a variety of ways. The simplest is a dona-tion to a fundraiser to attend and meet the candidate and their staff. This gives you the op- portunity to discuss the issues most important toyou, your practice, and your community. Howev- er, although these are fantastic events to attend, they generally are focused on the candidatemeeting the attendees. This can create a chal-lenge for a worthwhile exchange of ideas; how- ever, it provides an opportunity for an introduction. Access to these events is attainedthrough individual donations or as a contributing member of a state orthopedic society PAC or the AAOS Orthopedic PAC. Additionally, manypractices across the country and state specialty societies have creating advocacy divisions that give those practices and societies the opportu-nity to form relationships with representatives. The nal and most intimate way to build a rela- tionship with your local representative is to setup a meeting in your home district. On a per-sonal note, this is something I have done to meet the US Representatives in my districts where I practice and live. This has given ourgroup the chance to show them our practice lo- cations, discuss our goals as orthopedic sur- geons, and receive their feedback on pertinentissues. I have found this a great way to build rapport and trust with politicians to be able to have an open and honest discussion of issuesat hand. PAST ORTHOPEDIC ADVOCACY ACCOMPLISHMENTS Before discussing current issues at the time of this writing, it is useful to discuss past accom-plishments of the AAOS Orthopedic PAC andthe efforts put forth by the staff of the OGR. The accomplishments listed next happened at the federal and state level and include changein legislation and regulatory mandates through2018 and 2019. Federal Legislation /C15Passage of the Sports Medicine Licensure Clarity Act, which was a piece of legislation that originated from the AAOSand was advocated through to Congressf o rm o r et h a n5y e a r s . 7This legislation provides legal protection for sports medicine doctors caring for their athletesacross state line and helps to provide readily available care to athlete patients from the physicians who know them best. /C15Advocated on behalf of changes made in the 2018 Bipartisan Budget Act, which included clarifications to the Merit-basedIncentive Payment System (MIPS)program and repeal of the Independent Payment Advisory Board that was created through the Affordable Care Act. /C15Participated in including important verbiage in the SUPPORT Patients and Community Act focused on opioidcontrol. The AAOS ensured provisions that will require electronic prescribing of controlled substances and provideCenters for Disease Control and Prevention grants to states to improve their Prescription Drug MonitoringPrograms to help protect patients fromthe dangers of prescription opioid medication. Federal Regulations /C15Accomplished enacting rule changes to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines for total kneearthroplasty, which had been taken off the inpatient-only list. 8The rule change allows for surgeons to make the finaldecision for setting of care to that which best aligns with the patients' needs. /C15Effectively helped to delay the changes proposed by CMS in evaluation and management codes and continues to be actively involved in planning a betterstrategy for changes moving forward. State Advocacy Measures /C15South Carolina Orthopedic Association and the AAOS Health Policy Action Fundfound success with the South CarolinaImportance of Advocacy 79Supreme Court in protecting the integration of physicians with physical therapy programs.9 /C15Massachusetts Orthopedic Association was successful in advocating the reformation of state policy to allow expansion of ambulatory surgerycenters, which help provide patients with high-quality, more convenient access to care. /C15Similar to the Sports Medicine Licensure Clarity Act, multiple states with the support of local orthopedic associationssigned laws allowed traveling sports medicine doctors to practice medicine across state lines as long as theymaintain active licensure in their homestate. /C15Pennsylvania Orthopedic Society advocated for the passage of legislationthat limits the time period that health insurance companies could retroactively deny claims to a period of 24 months. /C15Texas Orthopedic Association effectively advocated for legislation that changes the screening process for scoliosis to bein line with the latest literature. Thepassage of this legislation and enactment of this screening will serve as a template for national changes for thebetterment of children and appropriate scoliosis screening and treatment. ONGOING ISSUES IN ORTHOPEDIC ADVOCACY Although the AAOS OGR and the Orthopedic PAC has been successful in advocating for achieving signicant changes on a state and fed- eral level, there are an ever growing number ofpolitical issues that are important to the prac- ticing orthopedic surgeon. The areas of impor- tance that the AAOS focuses on are constantlybeing updated on the AAOS Advocacy Web site. 10At the time of this writing the issues currently being discussed include the following: /C15Access to quality of care for patients, which includes discussions on liability reform, graduate medical education, registries, and research funding /C15Physician burden relief in the form of health information technology reform and antitrust reform /C15Physician ownership and ancillary services /C15Payment reform including Medicare, CMS, private payors, and quality issuesFurther details with more time-sensitive up- dates are always available through the AAOS Advocacy Web site. Additionally, for the ortho-pedic advocate who wants to make it to thetop of the advocacy pyramid and form relation- ship with your local representative there are \"Congressional One-Pagers,\" which providesuccinct summaries of all these issues. These are useful handouts to provide legislators and their staff. STARTING EARLY: ADVOCACY IN RESIDENCY There are ample resources available to the or- thopedic surgeon interested in being an advo-cate on behalf of patients and the profession. As political influence in health care has only grown over the decades, so too have the oppor-tunities for health care providers grown to exerttheir political influence. No matter the stage in one's career, there are always options for get- ting involved in political advocacy in orthope-dics. From residents to established orthopedic surgeons in large and small practices alike, there are ample opportunities for involvement. Although many orthopedic residents may have an interest in the political process, few probably think they have the ability to takethat interest and apply it, but they are mistaken. Although the main tenants of a successful advo- cate are money and time (two things orthopedicresidents are short on), there are increasing op-portunities built into training programs to bypass these hurdles and allow residents to get involved. The rst hurdle of money is onethat the leaders of the Orthopedic PAC have come up with creative solutions to promote involvement for orthopedic residents in training.First is a lower cost for residents to become members of the PAC's Capitol Club. The Capitol Club is a donor group of PAC members whohave given $1000 or more per year to the Ortho- pedic PAC. Recognizing the burden this creates for residents, the Futures Capitol Club wascreated with a minimum donation of $100 peryear for those in residency. This comes with all of the perks of a full Capitol Club membership. These include invitations to events at the Acad-emy annual meeting and National Orthopedic Leadership Conference with members of Congress, opportunities to attend local fundrais-ing events and trips, and the chance to hand deliver PAC donations to local candidates or sitting members. Another opportunity for resi-dents and their programs to gain recognition isto have 100% resident donation participationDavis 80to the PAC, even if it is just $1 per resident. This grows notoriety of the program with the PAC and the Executive Committee.11 The second issue of time is frequently depen- dent on availability within one's residency pro- gram. Although time is the one resource of which more cannot be made, many programsoffer elective time or time outside of clinical re- sponsibilities that can be used for interests in advocacy. This time is effectively used by usingthe resources of the Orthopedic PAC, your state orthopedic societies, or faculty mentors. Frequently any combination of these optionshave established avenues in which an early advo- cacy experience is gained. Faculty mentors are a great rst step because they have connectionsand resources available to be able to invite theinterested resident to a fundraiser or a visit with a policy maker at the state or federal level. Direct communication with one's state society isanother easy outlet with each state offering different levels of participation for residents. Finally, the Orthopedic PAC has multiple oppor-tunities in which residents can be involved. Membership in the Capitol Club comes with many excellent benets to allow early involve-ment. Interested residents who are willing tocommit more time and energy to early advocacy can apply for the Resident Advocacy Fellowship through the AAOS. 12This year-long fellowship is available for PGY-3 and PGY-4 residents to apply and involves advanced time working with the OGR learning more about legislation andhealth policy. One week of time in Washington, DC, is required and presentations at the Na- tional Orthopedic Leadership Conference, webi-nars, and advocacy promotion to other residents. ADVOCACY DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC Being an active participant in the political pro- cess involves relationship building through face-to-face interaction. In early 2020, the novelSARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) beganspreading throughout the world in a pandemic- type fashion. When the epidemic reached the United States in late February and early Marchof 2020 Americans were faced with a signicant change to their normal day to day activities. Re- strictions began with new terms, such as \"socialdistancing\" and stay at home orders. This transi- tioned to the complete shutdown of businesses in many parts of the country including electivesurgery bans to conserve hospital resources.Face-to-face interactions, large group meetings,and in-person ofce visits were canceled and replaced with videoconferences and the rapid expansion of telemedicine. Political advocacy played a large role in this process and the way in which it was accom- plished needed to happen in a much different way. Relationships that had been built beforethe pandemic played a large role in advocacy ef- forts moving forward. Many action items were taken care of from the government and insur-ance companies on the outset, such as the relax- ation of rules related to telehealth visits. Many other aspects required intervention from advo-cacy groups, such as ensuring Medicare advance payments were made and providing payroll pro- tection for medical practices. Furthermore, the actual advocacy process was turned upside down, further extenuated by the fact that 2020 was a major election year. Normally, fundraisers would have been sched-uled on a regular basis to meet candidates and incumbents. However, with the inability to travel and meet in person, many fundraising effortswere transitioned to teleconference format. The entire pandemic situation thus limited the ability and motivation of the individual donorto continue to donate. Additionally, althoughPACs were left with decreased donations, they maintained a broader ability to donate versus the individual donor. Therefore, this highlightsthe importance of maintaining a close connec- tion with a state orthopedic society PAC and the AAOS Orthopedic PAC. SUMMARY The intersection of health care and politics has been a decades long relationship that has only grown more intense and comingled with time.Although it is not the inherent nature of most physicians to insert themselves in the political process, the argument can be made that it is anecessary aspect of one's career to be sure the voices of the physician are heard. Physicians have always been advocates for patients sincethe beginning of the profession. Although theroot of patient advocacy is the doctor-patient relationship and providing the best care to each individual patient, the ability of the physi-cian to do so is greatly affected by the system in which they practice. In the United States, that system is strongly connected with govern-ment entities that legislate, regulate, and many times pay for the care provided. Therefore, an intimate knowledge of the political process andrelationships with policymakers involved givesthe physician the know-how and ability to beImportance of Advocacy 81sure their voices are heard to be able to provide the best possible care for their patients. CLINICS CARE POINTS /C15Orthopedic surgeons can be involved in the political process as an advocate forthose issues that affect their ability to practice medicine and deliver quality care to patients. /C15Advocacy involvement occurs on many levels from donating individually, to orthopedic political action committees locally and nationally, or creating andmaintaining relationships with lawmakers. /C15Participation in the advocacy process for orthopedic surgeons traditionally is lowbut has been increasing steadily. /C15A larger percentage of surgeons have an interest in forming relationships withgovernment members, which isfacilitated through state societies and the AAOS Orthopedic PAC.

All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlxiIn 1988, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report The Future of Public Health presented strong evidence to indicate that the governmental public health infrastructure was in disarray. The report provided a common lan-guage for national discussion about the role of public health (what we as asociety do collectively to assure the conditions in which people can behealthy) and about the steps necessary to strengthen the capacity, especiallyof governmental public health agencies (e.g., local and state health depart-ments and federal agencies), to fulfill that role. Moreover, the 1988 reportprompted significant actions by policy makers, public health agencies, andeducational institutions, including some remarkably successful efforts inseveral states to increase investment in governmental public health activitiesand to define more clearly the desired outcomes of such activities and the resources necessary for governmental agencies, such as health departments,to perform essential public health functions. Much has changed in public health practice since 1988. Many of these changes reflect progress in the science of improving health at the populationlevel, the emergence of innovative public -private partnerships in communi- ties, and the development of new ways to dialogue and act on health. ThePublic Health Functions Steering Committee, as representatives of the na-tional public health community, 1 developed a broad consensus definitionPreface Without health there is no happiness. Thomas Jefferson 1 The committee comprised the American Public Health Association, the Association of Schools of Public Health, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, the Envi- ronmental Council of the States, the National Association of County and City Health Offi-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlxii PREFACE of the essential public health services in 1994 (see Chapter 1, Box 1-1). Moreover, a national plan has been developed as part of Healthy People 2010 to strengthen the public health infrastructure; significant progress has been made in describing the nation 's public health workforce and its short- comings, and the framework for a National Health Information Infrastruc-ture has been defined. At the same time, the broader context of public health practice has been undergoing a radical transformation, as evidenced by the demographicchange in the age and diversity of the population, the shifting epidemiologyof disease from acute to chronic illness, the explosion in technology, andthe importance of global health to our national health. Further, state- andespecially federal-level investment in governmental public health infrastruc-ture\u2014workforce, information systems, laboratories, and other organiza- tional capacity \u2014has been uneven and unsystematic. Recently, substantial appropriations to this infrastructure have been directed to addressbioterrorism in the wake of the events of October 2001. However, concernsremain about the adequacy and sustainability of funding needed to assurethe balanced capability of this infrastructure to act effectively across thespectrum of public health activities, not only in response to crises. Theseand other factors place unprecedented stress on governmental public healthagencies as they struggle to carry out their mandates in an evolving micro-biological, political, and social environment. Given existing and anticipated challenges to assuring the health of the public, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); the Na-tional Institutes of Health (NIH); the Health Resources and Services Ad-ministration (HRSA); the Substance Abuse and Mental Health ServicesAdministration (SAMHSA); the Department of Health and Human Services(DHHS), Office of the Secretary, Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evalu-ation (DHHS/OS/ASPE); and the DHHS Office of Disease Prevention andHealth Promotion (ODPHP) entered into an interagency agreement to sup-port an Institute of Medicine study. The Committee on Assuring the Healthof the Public in the 21st Century was convened with the charge to create aframework for assuring population health 2 in the United States that would cials, the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors, the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors, the Public Health Foundation, and several agencies of the U.S. Public Health Service (Agency for Health Care Policy and Re-search, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Food and Drug Administration, Health Resources and Services Administration, Indian Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, and Substance Abuse and Mental Health ServicesAdministration). 2 Population health (also referred to in this report as the health of the population or the public's health ) is the focus of public health efforts. It refers to \"the health of a population as measured by health status indicators and as influenced by social, economic and physicalCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

In support ofthat overall goal, the study sought to: enhance understanding of the core purposes, functions, and roles of governmental public health agencies and other entities engaged in publichealth action in improving health outcomes for all; crystallize knowledge about the conditions under which improve- ments in population health occur and how to affect those conditions (Chap-ter 2); set an agenda for scientifically credible research that informs ef- forts to improve population health outcomes and that also fits the complex,adaptive systems in which population health occurs (Chapter 8); provide evidence-based recommendations for improving the prac- tices and the broader conditions that affect population health outcomes(Chapters 3, 4, and 5); address the capacity and workforce needed to support improve- ments in population health (Chapters 3 and 4); inform more strategic investments by grantmakers for population health improvement (Chapter 4); and promote engagement in the civic work of building healthier com- munities by a broad array of sectors, organizations, and people (Chapters 3through 8). To complete the report, entitled The Future of the Public 's Health , in acknowledgment of the 1988 report but to suggest the broader scope, thecommittee met nine times over a 19-month period between January 2001and July 2002. During this time, four workshops were held with represen-tatives from a variety of federal agencies, state and local nongovernmentalpublic health entities, private companies, and researchers in the field ofpublic health. The committee also engaged in a visioning activity to forecastalternative scenarios for the status of population health in the United Statesin the coming decade and to assist with the development of recommenda-tions that would appropriately address future challenges to public healthand health care. Additional data collection activities provided input regard-ing the current status of the public health system and examples of howchallenges to population health and health care delivery are being addressedat the state and local levels. Members of the committee also conducted sitevisits to two Turning Point projects (New Orleans, Louisiana; Franklin, environments, personal health practices, individual capacity and coping skills, human biol- ogy, early childhood development and health services \" (Federal, Provincial and Territorial Advisory Committee on Population Health, 1999).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlxiv PREFACE 3 Turning Point is a grant program of the W. K. Kellogg and Robert Wood Johnson foundations that began in 1996 and that ended in 2002. The goal of Turning Point has beento \"transform and strengthen the public health infrastructure in the United States \" by sup- porting states and local communities to \"improve the performance of their public health functions through strategic development and implementation processes \" (ww.wkkf.org). 4 Community Voices is a 5-year initiative launched by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation in 1998 in 13 U.S. communities. The goal of Community Voices is to improve health care for the uninsured and underinsured by strengthening and securing the safety net and communitysupport services.New Hampshire) and three Community Voices projects (Baltimore, Mary- land; Denver, Colorado; Oakland, California).3,4 Additionally, multiple requests were made for public comment. The committee also reviewed thecurrent literature on a wide range of subjects and received informationfrom its liaison panel of representatives from federal, state, and local agen-cies, as well as advocacy and nongovernmental organizations (see the Ac-knowledgments for a complete listing). Based on a consideration of this evidence, the committee decided against crafting a new vision statement. Instead, the committee embraced the visionarticulated by Healthy People 2010 , healthy people in healthy communi- ties, and turned its attention to developing recommendations for the prior- ity actions necessary to attain that vision. Given the immensity of the charge, the committee struggled to select these priorities from the vast array of areas in need of consideration andresponse. Several broad themes emerged from the committee 's discussion, including the need for a policy focus on population health; the need forgreater understanding and emphasis on the broad determinants of health;and the importance of strengthening the public health infrastructure, build-ing partnerships, developing systems of accountability, emphasizing evi-dence, and enhancing communication. These are the areas of action andchange needed to improve our ability to protect and promote health. The concept of a \"public health system \"\u2014a complex network of indi- viduals and organizations that, when working together, can represent \"what we as a society do collectively to assure the conditions in which people canbe healthy \" (IOM, 1988: 1) \u2014occurred early in committee deliberations. The committee also found that many entities and sectors are needed to acton the multiple factors that shape population health, and focused on severalkey partners who can have a particularly significant impact on health byworking individually and as potential actors in a public health system. Inaddition to the governmental public health infrastructure, the committeeexamined the community, the health care delivery system, employers andbusiness, the media, and academia.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlPREFACE xv The broad themes outlined above are discussed in more detail in Chap- ter 1, which also provides a discussion about the status of the health ofAmericans at the beginning of the twenty-first century, with a special focuson the mismatch of health spending and health outcomes, the nation 's shortcomings in health status (especially disparities in health among popu-lation groups), and the potential future challenges and threats to popula-tion health. Chapter 2 presents a framework to illustrate the well-supported hy- pothesis that the health of populations and individuals is shaped by a widerange of factors in the social, economic, natural, built, and political envi-ronments. These factors interact in complex ways with each other and withinnate individual traits such as race, sex, and genetics. The chapter thenfocuses specifically on several social determinants of health most robustlysupported by the evidence. Approaching health from a broad perspectivetakes into account the potential effects of social connectedness, economicinequality, social norms, and public policies on health-related behaviorsand health status. The chapter discusses seat belt and tobacco controlpolicies as examples of public policies that have had considerable positiveimpacts on health status because they acknowledge the population-leveland ecological factors involved in producing good or ill health. The chapters that follow provide evidence of the positive impacts that key potential participants can have acting individually or in partnership, asappropriate, in a public health system working for the health of the publicin the twenty-first century. When most people think of public health, they think of state and local health departments, which have traditionally been responsible for publichealth services. Chapter 3 discusses the role of the governmental public health agencies at the federal, state, tribal, and local levels as the backbone of the public health system. In particular, the chapter examines the uniquerole and responsibility that governmental public health agencies have inpromoting and protecting the public 's health by facilitating, supporting, and empowering other potential participants in a public health system. Thischapter also discusses the importance of political will to support and fi-nance the development and maintenance of a strong governmental publichealth infrastructure that can ensure that all communities have access to theessential public health services. Chapter 4 discusses the community , defined as narrowly as a neighbor- hood or as broadly as the nation. The community is both a setting \u2014the place where health is supported and protected by social connections andhealthy social, built, economic, and natural environments or risked anddamaged by detrimental environments and social norms \u2014and a potential partner in the public health system through its organizations, associations,and networks. Communities have the knowledge and resources that areCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlxvi PREFACE necessary ingredients in assuring population health, and Chapter 4 illus- trates clearly the significance of authentic community engagement in thepublic health system. The health care delivery system and the role that it can play in main- taining both individual and community health are discussed in Chapter 5.Particular attention is given to this system 's current fragility and the impli- cations of this fragility for the effectiveness of governmental public healthagencies and the broader public health system. The chapter makes note ofthe historic gap in priorities for investment between public health andhealth care. Also, it proposes ways for the health care delivery system torefocus its efforts in health improvement and strengthen its collaborationwith governmental public health agencies to ensure the best possible diseasesurveillance, the promotion of healthier communities as well as healthierindividuals, and preparedness for any emergencies. Chapter 6 highlights the current and potential contributions of employ- ers and businesses (private and public) to the health of their workforces and to the communities in which they are located. Although employers do nottypically see themselves as partners in the public health system, their poten-tial contribution to assuring population health cannot be underestimated.Most people spend at least a third of their days on the job; and the work-place may supply their health care insurance, may offer messages or activi-ties that support or undermine health, and may also shape their health withoccupational and environmental exposures and psychosocial stresses. Busi-nesses and employers are also significant members of communities every-where, and in recent years, many have acknowledged and acted upon theirrole as corporate citizens by fostering improvement in the economic andphysical health of communities. The role of the media in promoting health is the subject of Chapter 7. That chapter explores the unique potential of the news and entertainmentmedia in communicating and informing the public about health risks andbenefits, health policy, and related matters. Although their approaches andend goals are somewhat different, the news media 's mandate coincides with that of the public health system: to serve and be accountable to the public.It is imperative for its own objectives and those of the public that the media\"get it right. \" Also, a continuous dialogue among public health officials and educators and reporters, media leaders, and educators can play a cru-cial role in facilitating the development of media expertise in public healthand public health expertise in providing timely, accurate, and understand-able health information. Chapter 8 highlights the responsibilities of academia in training the individuals who work in public health and health care professions and inbuilding the science base for health promotion, disease prevention, andcommunity health action.

The Future of the Public 's Health began with an extensive charge. The committee thus endeavored to (1) examine and (2) explain the nation 's health status, as well as (3) describe the key individuals and organizationsneeded to work individually or together as a public health system to createthe conditions in which people can be healthy and (4) recommend theevidence-based actions necessary to make this system an effective force inattaining the vision of healthy people in healthy communities, and, ulti-mately, a healthier nation and a healthier world. Achieving this vision will be a dynamic process as our knowledge about the factors that create the conditions for health increases. The sophistica-tion of our actions must evolve to shape forces in the global, national, andlocal environments that can act for or against health. Finally, we mustsustain our commitment to a healthier nation through education, invest-ment, and political will. Jo Ivey Boufford, Committee co-chair Christine K.

All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html1Executive Summary The beginning of the twenty-first century provided an early preview of the health challenges that the United States will face in the coming decades.The systems and entities that protect and promote the public's health,already challenged by problems like obesity, toxic environments, a largeuninsured population, and health disparities, must also confront emergingthreats, such as antimicrobial resistance and bioterrorism. The social, cul-tural, and global contexts of the nation's health are also undergoing rapidand dramatic change. Scientific and technological advances, such asgenomics and informatics, extend the limits of knowledge and human po-tential more rapidly than their implications can be absorbed and actedupon. At the same time, people, products, and germs migrate and thenation's demographics are shifting in ways that challenge public and pri-vate resources. Against this background, the Committee on Assuring theHealth of the Public in the 21st Century was charged with describing aframework for assuring the public's health in the new century. The report reviews national health achievements in recent decades, but also examines the hidden vulnerabilities that undercut current health poten-tial, and that, if not addressed, could produce a decline in the future healthstatus of the American people. The concept of health as a public good isdiscussed, as is the fundamental duty of government to promote and pro-tect the health of the public. The report describes the rationale formultisectoral engagement in partnership with government and the rolesthat different actors can play to support a healthy future for the Americanpeople. Finally, it describes major trends that are likely to influence thenation's health in the coming decades.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html2 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC'S HEALTH The committee 's work began with a vision \u2014healthy people in healthy communities . This is not a new idea, but it is the guiding vision of Healthy People 2010 , the health agenda for the nation. The committee embraced that vision and began discussing who should be responsible for assuringAmerica 's health at the beginning of the twenty-first century \u2014a duty his- torically assigned to governmental public health agencies, through the workof national, state, tribal, and local departments of health. Current realitiesindicate that this is no longer sufficient. On the one hand, government hasa unique responsibility to promote and protect the health of the people builton a constitutional, theoretical, and practical foundation. However, gov-ernmental public health agencies alone cannot assure the nation 's health. First, public resources are finite, and the public 's health is just one of many priorities. Second, democratic societies define and limit the types of actionsthat can be undertaken only by government and reserve other social choicesfor private institutions. Third, the determinants that interact to create goodor ill health derive from various sources and sectors. Among other factors,health is shaped by laws and policies, employment and income, and socialnorms and influences (McGinnis et al., 2002). Fourth, there is a growingrecognition that individuals, communities, and various social institutionscan form powerful collaborative relationships to improve health that gov-ernment alone cannot replicate. Health is a primary public good because many aspects of human poten- tial such as employment, social relationships, and political participation arecontingent on it. In view of the value of health to employers, business,communities, and society in general, creating the conditions for people tobe healthy should also be a shared social goal. The special role of govern-ment must be allied with the contributions of other sectors of society. Thisreport builds on the foundation of the Future of Public Health report, which asserted that public health is \"what we as a society do collectively to assure the conditions in which people can be healthy \" (IOM, 1988). In addition to assessing the state and needs of the governmental public healthinfrastructure \u2014the backbone of the public health system \u2014this report also focuses on the roles and actions of other entities that could be potentialpartners within such a system. The emphasis on an intersectoral public health system does not super- sede the special duty of the governmental public health agencies but, rather,complements it with a call for the contributions of other sectors of societythat have enormous power to influence health. A public health systemwould include the governmental public health agencies, the health caredelivery system, and the public health and health sciences academia, sectorsthat are heavily engaged and more clearly identified with health activities.The committee has also identified communities and their many entities(e.g., schools, organizations, and religious congregations), businesses andCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Businesses play important, often dual, roles in shaping population health.In the occupational setting, through environmental impacts, as membersof communities, and as purveyors of products available for mass con-sumption, businesses may undermine health by polluting, spreading envi-ronmental toxicants, and producing or marketing products detrimental tohealth. However, businesses can and often do take steps to contribute topopulation health through efforts such as facilitating economic develop-ment and regional employment and workplace-specific contributions suchas health promotion and the provision of health care benefits. The mediais also featured because of its deeply influential role as a conduit forinformation and as a shaper of public opinion about health and relatedmatters. The events of the autumn of 2001 placed the governmental public health infrastructure under unprecedented public and political scrutiny.Although motivated by concern about its preparedness to respond to apotential crisis, this scrutiny offered an opportunity to assess the overalladequacy of the governmental public health infrastructure to promoteand protect the public 's health in the new century. This status check revealed facts that were well known to the public health community butthat surprised many policy makers and much of the public. The govern-mental public health infrastructure has suffered from political neglect andfrom the pressure of political agendas and public opinion that frequentlyoverride empirical evidence. Under the glare of a national crisis, policymakers and the public became aware of vulnerable and outdated healthinformation systems and technologies, an insufficient and inadequatelytrained public health workforce, antiquated laboratory capacity, a lack ofreal-time surveillance and epidemiological systems, ineffective and frag-mented communications networks, incomplete domestic preparedness andemergency response capabilities, and communities without access to es-sential public health services. These problems leave the nation 's health vulnerable \u2014and not only to exotic germs and bioterrorism. The health of the public is also at risk when social and other environmental conditionsundermine health, including toxic water, air, and housing; inaccurate andconfusing health information; poverty; a lack of health care; and unequalopportunities for health. Government 's partners, potential actors in the public health system, can contribute to assuring population health byhelping to change the conditions for health in communities, at work, andthrough the media. AREAS OF ACTION AND CHANGE To address the present and future challenges faced by the nation 's publicCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html4 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH health system \u2014including potential actors in the private and nonprofit sec- tors\u2014this report proposes six areas of action and change to be undertaken by all who work to assure population health. These areas include 1. Adopting a population health approach that considers the multiple determinants of health; 2. Strengthening the governmental public health infrastructure, which forms the backbone of the public health system; 3. Building a new generation of intersectoral partnerships that also draw on the perspectives and resources of diverse communities andactively engage them in health action; 4. Developing systems of accountability to assure the quality and availability of public health services; 5. Making evidence the foundation of decision making and the mea- sure of success; and 6. Enhancing and facilitating communication within the public health system (e.g., among all levels of the governmental public healthinfrastructure and between public health professionals and com-munity members). FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Governmental Public Health Infrastructure Finding: Public health law at the federal, state, and local levels is often outdated and internally inconsistent. This leads to inefficiency and a lack ofcoordination and may even pose a danger in a crisis requiring an immediateand effective public health response. Pioneering work at the national level hasgone into developing models and guidance to assist states in reforming theirpublic health laws as appropriate for their unique legal structures and publichealth preparedness needs, but a more comprehensive effort is needed. 1. The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), in consultation with states, should appoint a nationalcommission to develop a framework and recommendations forstate public health law reform. In particular, the national commis-sion would review all existing public health law as well as theTurning Point 1 Model State Public Health Act and the Model State 1 Turning Point, a program funded by the Robert Wood Johnson and the W. K. Kellogg foundations, works to strengthen the public health infrastructure at the local and state levels across the United States and spearheads the Turning Point National Collaborative on Public Health Statute Modernization.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Finding: The public health workforce must have appropriate education and training to perform its role. Today, a majority of governmental public healthworkers have little or no training in public health. Enhancing the knowledgeand skills of governmental public health workers and nongovernmental work-ers who perform public health functions is necessary to ensure that essentialpublic health services are competently delivered. Assessing and strengtheningcompetence will help to ensure workforce preparedness, nurture leadership,and assure the quality of public health services. 2. All federal, state, and local governmental public health agencies should develop strategies to ensure that public health workers whoare involved in the provision of essential public health services dem-onstrate mastery of the core public health competencies appropriateto their jobs. The Council on Linkages between Academia and Pub-lic Health Practice 3 should also encourage the competency develop- ment of public health professionals working in public health systemroles in for-profit and nongovernmental entities (Chapter 3). 3. Congress should designate funds for the Centers for Disease Con- trol and Prevention (CDC) and the Health Resources and ServicesAdministration (HRSA) to periodically assess the preparedness ofthe public health workforce, to document the training necessary tomeet basic competency expectations, and to advise on the fundingnecessary to provide such training (Chapter 3). 4. Leadership training, support, and development should be a high priority for governmental public health agencies and other organi- 2 The Model State Emergency Health Powers Act (MSEHPA) provides states with the powers needed \"to detect and contain bioterrorism or a naturally occurring disease outbreak. Legislative bills based on the MSEHPA have been introduced in 34 states \" (Gostin et al., 2002). 3 The Council on Linkages between Academia and Public Health Practice is comprised of leaders from national organizations representing the public health practice and academic communities. The Council grew out of the Public Health Faculty/Agency Forum, which devel-oped recommendations for improving the relevance of public health education to the de- mands of public health in the practice sector. The Council and its partners have focused attention on the need for a public health practice research agenda.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html6 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH zations in the public health system and for schools of public health that supply the public health infrastructure with its professionalsand leaders (Chapter 3). 5. A formal national dialogue should be initiated to address the issue of public health workforce credentialing. The Secretary of DHHSshould appoint a national commission on public health workforcecredentialing to lead this dialogue. The commission should becharged to determine if a credentialing system would further thegoal of creating a competent workforce and, if applicable, the man-ner and time frame for implementation by governmental publichealth agencies at all levels. The dialogue should include represen-tatives from federal, state, and local public health agencies,academia, and public health professional organizations who canrepresent and discuss the various perspectives on the workforcecredentialing debate (Chapter 3). Finding: Developments in communication and information technologies present both opportunities and challenges to attaining the vision of healthypeople in healthy communities. Harnessing the potential of these technolo-gies will enable public health officials to collect and disseminate informa-tion more efficiently, improve the effectiveness of public health interven-tions, and enable the public to understand what services should be provided,and thus what they have the right to expect from their public officials. 6. All partners within the public health system should place special emphasis on communication as a critical core competency of publichealth practice. Governmental public health agencies at all levelsshould use existing and emerging tools (including information tech-nologies) for effective management of public health informationand for internal and external communication. To be effective, suchcommunication must be culturally appropriate and suitable to theliteracy levels of the individuals in the communities they serve(Chapter 3). Finding: Existing information networks make it difficult, and sometimes impossible, for governmental public health agencies to exchange informa-tion and communicate effectively with the health care delivery system forthe purposes of surveillance, reporting, and appropriately responding tothreats to the public 's health. Clear communication and enhanced informa- tion gathering, processing, and dissemination mechanisms will increase theaccountability and effectiveness of governmental public health agencies andother public health system actors. Individuals and communities may alsoCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlEXECUTIVE SUMMARY 7 benefit by being able to contribute and collect information directly relevant to them. 7. The Secretary of DHHS should provide leadership to facilitate the development and implementation of the National Health Informa-tion Infrastructure (NHII). Implementation of NHII should takeinto account, where possible, the findings and recommendations ofthe National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS)working group on NHII. Congress should consider options forfunding the development and deployment of NHII (e.g., in supportof clinical care, health information for the public, and public healthpractice and research) through payment changes, tax credits, subsi-dized loans, or grants (Chapter 3). Finding: At this time, DHHS lacks a system for conducting regular assess- ments of the adequacy and capacity of the governmental public healthinfrastructure. Such assessments are urgently needed to keep Congress andthe public informed and would play an important role in supporting aregular process of assessment and evaluation at state and local public healthagency levels. 8. DHHS should be accountable for assessing the state of the nation's governmental public health infrastructure and its capacity to pro-vide the essential public health services to every community and forreporting that assessment annually to Congress and the nation.The assessment should include a thorough evaluation of federal,state, and local funding for the nation's governmental public healthinfrastructure and should be conducted in collaboration with stateand local officials. The assessment should identify strengths andgaps and serve as the basis for plans to develop a funding andtechnical assistance plan to assure sustainability. The public avail-ability of these reports will enable state and local public healthagencies to use them for continual self-assessment and evaluation(Chapter 3). Finding: The capacity of the nation 's public health laboratories should be assessed. Every state has at least one state public health laboratory tosupport infectious disease surveillance and other public health activities.About 60 percent of the 3,000 local health departments provide somelaboratory services. Enhanced funding has been provided to prepare statesand some urban areas for bioterrorism and other emergencies. The ad-equacy of these funds and how effectively they are being used to addresslaboratory capacity problems are unknown. The appropriate funding lev-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

DHHS should evaluate the status of the nation 's public health laboratory system, including an assessment of the impact of recentincreased funding. The evaluation should identify remaining gaps,and funding should be allocated to close them. Working with thestates, DHHS should agree on a base funding level that will main-tain the enhanced laboratory system and allow the rapid deploy-ment of newly developed technologies (Chapter 3). Finding: After adequate funding levels are determined for the governmen- tal public health infrastructure, the appropriate investment level is neededto assure that every community has access to the essential public healthservices. 10. DHHS should develop a comprehensive investment plan for a strong national governmental public health infrastructure with atimetable, clear performance measures, and regular progress re-ports to the public. State and local governments should also pro-vide adequate, consistent, and sustainable funding for the govern-mental public health infrastructure (Chapter 3). Finding: Current funding structures frequently burden the work of state and local public health jurisdictions with administrative requirements.\"Stove-pipe \" (i.e., categorical) funding is often inflexible, at times discour- aging evidence-based planning and use of funds or the blending of resourcesin special circumstances. 11. The federal government and states should renew efforts to experi- ment with clustering or consolidation of categorical grants for thepurpose of increasing local flexibility to address priority healthconcerns and enhance the efficient use of limited resources (Chap-ter 3). Finding: Although the health care delivery system has several mechanisms for accreditation and quality assurance, the committee found that there areno such structures for the governmental public health infrastructure. Ac-creditation mechanisms may help to ensure the robustness and efficiency ofthe governmental public health infrastructure, assure the quality of publichealth services, and transparently provide information to the public aboutthe quality of the services delivered.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlEXECUTIVE SUMMARY 9 12. The Secretary of DHHS should appoint a national commission to consider if an accreditation system would be useful for improvingand building state and local public health agency capacities. If sucha system is deemed useful, the commission should make recom-mendations on how it would be governed and develop mechanisms(e.g., incentives) to gain state and local government participation inthe accreditation effort. Membership on this commission shouldinclude representatives from CDC, the Association of State andTerritorial Health Officials, the National Association of Countyand City Health Officials, and nongovernmental organizations(Chapter 3). Finding: Research is needed to guide policy decisions that shape public health practice. The committee had hoped to provide specific guidanceelaborating on the types and levels of workforce, infrastructure, relatedresources, and financial investments necessary to ensure the availability ofessential public health services to all of the nation 's communities. However, such evidence is limited, and there is no agenda or support for this type ofresearch, despite the critical need for such data to promote and protect thenation 's health. 13. CDC, in collaboration with the Council on Linkages between Academia and Public Health Practice and other public health sys-tem partners, should develop a research agenda and estimate thefunding needed to build the evidence base that will guide policymaking for public health practice (Chapter 3). Finding: Effective interagency collaboration on health issues at the federal level is crucial but difficult because of the specialized nature of agencystructures and responsibilities. Furthermore, many agencies not tradition-ally associated with health issues make policy and manage programs withpotential implications for health. More effective coordinating structures areneeded to reduce obstacles to the effective use of federal regulatory andstandard-setting powers in health. Mechanisms are needed to develop col-laborative relationships and to harmonize regulations within DHHS, acrossfederal agencies, and among federal state and local governments to assureeffective action for protecting the population 's health. 14. The Secretary of DHHS should review the regulatory authorities of DHHS agencies with health-related responsibilities to reduce over-lap and inconsistencies, ensure that the department 's management structure is best suited to coordinate among agencies within DHHSwith health-related responsibilities, and, to the extent possible, sim-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Similar efforts should be made to improve coordinationwith other federal cabinet agencies performing important publichealth services, such as the Department of Agriculture and theEnvironmental Protection Agency (Chapter 3). Finding: The success of the public health system depends in part on col- laboration among all levels of government. Although noting the impor-tance of preserving state autonomy and the ability to address local cir-cumstances, the National Governors ' Association (1997) acknowledged a need for a federal role in certain domestic issues \u2014where issues are na- tional in scope and where the national interest is at risk \u2014and to help states meet the needs of special populations. Collaboration on such issueswould also improve the alignment of policy across federal agencies. Thecommittee believes that a more formal entity could facilitate the linkbetween the Secretary of DHHS and state health officers for the purposeof improving communication, coordination, and collaborative action on anational health agenda. 15. Congress should mandate the establishment of a National Public Health Council. This National Public Health Council would bringtogether the Secretary of DHHS and state health commissioners atleast annually to Provide a forum for communication and collaboration on action to achieve national health goals as articulated inHealthy People 2010; Advise the Secretary of DHHS on public health issues; Advise the Secretary of DHHS on financing and regula- tions that affect governmental public health capacity at thestate and local levels; Provide a forum for overseeing the development of an in- centive-based federal -state-funded system to sustain a gov- ernmental public health infrastructure that can assure theavailability of essential public health services to everyAmerican community and can monitor progress towardthis goal (e.g., through report cards); Review and evaluate the domestic policies of other cabinet agencies for their impact on national health outcomes (e.g.,through health impact reports) and on the reduction andelimination of health disparities; and Submit an annual report on their deliberations and recom- mendations to Congress.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlEXECUTIVE SUMMARY 11 The Council should be chaired by the Secretary of DHHS and cochaired by a state health director on a rotating basis. An appro-priately resourced secretariat should be established in the Office ofthe Secretary to ensure that the Council has access to the informa-tion and expertise of all DHHS agencies during its deliberations(Chapter 3). Community Finding: Community organizations are close to the populations they serve and are therefore a crucial part of the public health system for identifyingneeds and responses and evaluating results. Communication and collabora-tion between community organizations and health departments are oftenlimited, leading to the duplication of effort and an inefficient use of re-sources. Moreover, foundation and governmental funding mechanisms areoften not structured in ways that encourage broad community engagementand leadership at all stages. Communities are sometimes brought into theeffort late, after planning has begun, or they are simply used as informantsor subjects of research. The goal of achieving lasting change for healthimprovement should guide community groups and public and privatefunders. 16. Local governmental public health agencies should support commu- nity-led efforts to inventory resources, assess needs, formulate col-laborative responses, and evaluate outcomes for community healthimprovement and the elimination of health disparities. Govern-mental public health agencies should provide community organiza-tions and coalitions with technical assistance and support in identi-fying and securing resources as needed and at all phases of theprocess (Chapter 4). 17. Governmental and private-sector funders of community health ini- tiatives should plan their investments with a focus on long-lastingchange. Such a focus would include realistic time lines, an emphasison ongoing community engagement and leadership, and a finalgoal of institutionalizing effective project components in the localcommunity or public health system as appropriate (Chapter 4). Health Care Delivery System Finding: Health care is an important determinant of population and indi- vidual health. Although most Americans receive the health care services that they require, the approximately 41 million people who have no healthCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html12 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH insurance experience difficulty in accessing care and are often unable to obtain needed services. Furthermore, the services that they do receive maynot be timely, appropriate, or well coordinated. Recent Institute of Medi-cine (IOM) reports have found that health insurance coverage is associatedwith better health outcomes for children and adults. It is also associatedwith having a regular source of care and with the greater and more appro-priate use of health services. These factors, in turn, improve the likelihoodof disease screening and early detection, the management of chronic ill-nesses, and the effective treatment of acute conditions. The ultimate resultis better health for children, adults, and families. Increased health insurancecoverage would likely reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the use ofappropriate health care services and may also reduce disparities in morbid-ity and mortality among ethnic groups. 18. Adequate population health cannot be achieved without making comprehensive and affordable health care available to every personresiding in the United States. It is the responsibility of the federalgovernment to lead a national effort to examine the options avail-able to achieve stable health care coverage of individuals and fami-lies and to assure the implementation of plans to achieve that result(Chapter 5). Finding: In addition to a lack of health care coverage, many people are covered by health insurance plans that do not include coverage for pre-ventive health care, mental health, substance abuse treatment, and dentalhealth services or require copayments that lessen access (Allukian, 1999;King, 2000; Solanki et al., 2000). This causes many individuals to livewith undiagnosed mental illness and others to go without treatment(DHHS, 1999). Many children and adults suffer from oral health condi-tions that may affect their overall health status (DHHS, 2000). Theseoften-neglected services constitute gaps in efforts to assure the health ofthe population. 19. All public and privately funded insurance plans should include age- appropriate preventive services as recommended by the U.S. Pre-ventive Services Task Force and provide evidence-based coverageof oral health, mental health, and substance abuse treatment ser-vices (Chapter 5). Finding: As the public health system strains to meet the challenges posed by increasing costs, an aging population, and a range of threats to health, itwill need a meaningful partnership with the health care delivery sector toattain their shared population health goals.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlEXECUTIVE SUMMARY 13 20. Bold, large-scale demonstrations should be funded by the federal government and other major investors in health care to test radicalnew approaches to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare financing and delivery systems. The experiments should effec-tively link delivery systems with other components of the publichealth system and focus on improving population health whileeliminating disparities. The demonstrations should be supportedby adequate resources to enable innovative ideas to be fairly tested(Chapter 5). Businesses and Employers Finding: Employers play a major role in the health of their employees and the population at large through their impacts on natural and built environ-ments, through workplace conditions, and through their relationship withcommunities. For example, employers may be an important part of aregion 's economic development, which, in turn, may support health im- provement. In addition, low unemployment rates and vibrant businessesare likely to mean better housing, higher incomes, and improved overallquality of life within communities. Furthermore, employers facilitate accessto health care services by purchasing health care for their employees. 21. The federal government should develop programs to assist small employers and employers with low-wage workers to purchasehealth insurance at reasonable rates (Chapter 6). 22. The corporate community and public health agencies should ini- tiate and enhance joint efforts to strengthen health promotion anddisease and injury prevention programs for employees and theircommunities. As an early step, the corporate and governmentalpublic health community should: a. Strengthen partnership and collaboration by Developing direct linkages between local public health agencies and business leaders to forge a common languageand understanding of employee and community healthproblems and to participate in setting community healthgoals and strategies for achieving them, and Developing innovative ways for the corporate and govern- mental public health communities to gather, interpret, andexchange mutually meaningful data and information, suchCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Enhance communication by Developing effective employer and community communi- cation and education programs focused on the benefits ofand options for health promotion and disease and injuryprevention, and Using proven marketing and social marketing techniques to promote individual behavioral and community change. c. Develop the evidence base for workplace and community inter- ventions through greater public, private, and philanthropic in-vestments in research to extend the science and improve theeffectiveness of workplace and community interventions to pro-mote health and prevent disease and injury. d. Recognize business leadership in employee and community health by elevating the level of recognition given to corporateinvestment in employee and community health. The Secretariesof DHHS and the Department of Commerce, along with busi-ness leaders (e.g., chambers of commerce and businessroundtables), should jointly sponsor a Corporate Investmentin Health Award. The award would recognize private-sectorentities that have demonstrated exemplary civic and social re-sponsibility for improving the health of their workers and thecommunity (Chapter 6). Media Finding: Both the news and entertainment media shape public opinion and influence decision making, with potentially critical effects on populationhealth. Moreover, public health efforts and especially the activities of gov-ernmental public health agencies often receive and attract little media atten-tion, explaining in part the widespread lack of understanding about theconcepts and content of public health activities (i.e., population-level healthpromotion and protection, as well as disease prevention). Editors and jour-nalists and medical and public health officials generally do not understandeach other 's perspectives, methods, and objectives. This lack of understand- ing frequently leads to the provision of inaccurate or inadequate healthinformation and missed opportunities to communicate effectively to thepublic. The journalism and public health communities have identified aCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlEXECUTIVE SUMMARY 15 clear need for training, research, and dialogue to improve their ability to accurately inform and communicate with the public, communities, andother actors in the public health system. 23. An ongoing dialogue should be maintained between medical and public health officials and editors and journalists at the local leveland their representative associations nationally. Furthermore,foundations and governmental health agencies should provideopportunities to develop and evaluate educational and trainingprograms that provide journalists with experiences that will deepentheir knowledge of public health subject matter and provide publichealth workers with a foundation in communication theory, mes-saging, and application (Chapter 7). 24. The television networks, television stations, and cable providers should increase the amount of time they donate to public serviceannouncements (PSAs) as partial fulfillment of the public servicerequirement in their Federal Communications Commission (FCC)licensing agreements (Chapter 7). 25. The FCC should review its regulations for PSA broadcasting on television and radio to ensure a more balanced broadcasting sched-ule that will reach a greater proportion of the viewing and listeningaudiences (Chapter 7). 26. Public health officials and local and national entertainment media should work together to facilitate the communication of accurateinformation about disease and about medical and health issues inthe entertainment media (Chapter 7). 27. Public health and communication researchers should develop an evi- dence base on media influences on health knowledge and behavior,as well as on the promotion of healthy public policy (Chapter 7). Academia Finding: Academia provides degree and continuing education to a signifi- cant proportion of the public health workforce. Consistent with the previ-ous recommendations to assess workforce competency and develop strate-gies to overcome deficits, changes are needed in both academic settings andcurricula and in the financial support available to students training forcareers in public health.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Academic institutions should increase integrated interdisciplinary learning opportunities for students in public health and other re-lated health science professions. Such efforts should include notonly multidisciplinary education but also interdisciplinary educa-tion and appropriate incentives for faculty to undertake such ac-tivities (Chapter 8). 29. Congress should increase funding for HRSA programs that provide financial support for students enrolled in public health degreeprograms through mechanisms such as training grants, loan repay-ments, and service obligation grants. Funding should also be pro-vided to strengthen the Public Health Training Center program toeffectively meet the educational needs of the existing public healthworkforce and to facilitate public health worker access to thecenters. Support for leadership training of state and local healthdepartment directors and local community leaders should continuethrough funding of the National and Regional Public HealthLeadership Institutes and distance-learning materials developed byHRSA and CDC (Chapter 8). Finding: The committee finds that health-related research is disproportion- ately biomedical, focused on the health and health problems of individuals.Funding and incentives for population-level research and community-basedprevention research are low, as these are not priority areas within academiaor the governmental public health infrastructure. 30. Federal funders of research and academic institutions should recog- nize and reward faculty scholarship related to public health prac-tice research (Chapter 8). 31. The committee recommends that Congress provide funds for CDC to enhance its investigator-initiated program for prevention re-search while maintaining a strong Centers, Institutes, and Offices(CIO)-generated research program. CDC should take steps thatinclude Expanding the external peer review mechanism for review of investigator-initiated research; Allowing research to be conducted over the more generous time lines often required by prevention research; and Establishing a central mechanism for coordination of investigator-initiated proposal submissions (Chapter 8).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlEXECUTIVE SUMMARY 17 32. CDC should authorize an analysis of the funding levels necessary for effective Prevention Research Center functioning, taking intoaccount the levels authorized by P.L. 98 -551 as well as the amount of prevention research occurring in other institutions and organiza-tions (Chapter 8). 33. NIH should increase the portion of its budget allocated to popula- tion- and community-based prevention research that Addresses population-level health problems; Involves a definable population and operates at the level of the whole person; Evaluates the application and impacts of new discoveries on the actual health of the population; and Focuses on the behavioral and environmental (social, eco- nomic, cultural, physical) factors associated with primary andsecondary prevention of disease and disability in populations. Furthermore, the committee recommends that the Director of NIH report annually to the Secretary of DHHS on the scope of population-and community-based prevention research activities undertaken by theNIH centers and institutes (Chapter 8). 34. Academic institutions should develop criteria for recognizing and rewarding faculty scholarship related to service activities thatstrengthen public health practice (Chapter 8). The findings and recommendations outlined above illustrate the areas of action and change that the committee believes should be emphasized byall potential actors in the public health system. Recommendations are di-rected to many parties, because in a society as diverse and decentralized asthat of the United States, achieving population health requires contribu-tions from all levels of government, the private business sector, and thevariety of institutions and organizations that shape opportunities, attitudes,behaviors, and resources affecting health. Governmental public health agen-cies have the responsibility to facilitate and nurture the conditions condu-cive to good health. Without the active collaboration of other importantinstitutions, however, they cannot produce the healthy people in healthycommunities envisioned in Healthy People 2010 .Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Toguide this process, the Committee embraced the vision set forth by Healthy People 2010 (DHHS, 2000)\u2014 healthy people in healthy communities\u2014 with its recognition of both individual and community dimensions. Healthy People 2010 calls for a national effort to improve overall population health and, where possible, to eliminate disparities in health in the United States.This vision has been endorsed as national policy at the highest levels ofgovernment and by most states, many localities, and a large coalition ofbusiness and nonprofit organizations. What is needed now is action at abroad societal level to achieve this vision. This report provides a frameworkfor action, identifies those who must be involved, and outlines priority stepsto be taken. In this chapter, the committee outlines our approach and therationale for it. We 1. Review the nation's health achievement in the past century, which is tempered by concerns about falling short in the present and being illequipped to meet future challenges; 2. Explore the nature of health as a public good, the fundamental and statutory duty of government to assure the health of the public, and theneed and rationale for multisectoral engagement in partnership with gov-ernment; 3. Examine the reasons for the nation's deficient health status;Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Describe the system and actors who can work together to assure the nation 's health; 5. Propose action steps to help attain the vision; and6. Discuss national and global trends that may affect America 's health in the coming decades. ACHIEVEMENT AND DISAPPOINTMENT The health of the American people at the beginning of the twenty-first century would astonish those living in 1900. By every measure, we arehealthier, live longer, and enjoy lives that are less likely to be marked byinjuries, ill health, or premature death. In the past century, infant mortalitydeclined and life expectancy increased (DHHS, 2002). Vaccines and antibi-otics made once life-threatening ailments preventable or less serious; andhomes, workplaces, roads, and automobiles became safer. In addition tothe many health achievements facilitated by public health 1 efforts such as sanitation and immunization, unparalleled medical advances and nationalinvestment in health care also have contributed to improvements in healthoutcomes. Roughly 13 percent of our gross domestic product \u2014about $1.3 trillion in 2000, which represents a higher percentage than that of any othermajor industrialized nation \u2014goes toward health-related expenditures (DHHS, 2001; Levit et al., 2002). Despite the nation 's wealth, expenditures for health care and research, and scientific and technical accomplishments, the United States is not fullymeeting its potential in the area of population health (Kindig, 1997). Foryears, the life expectancies of both men and women in the United Stateshave lagged behind those of their counterparts in most other industrializednations (Starfield, 1998; Jee and Or, 1999). Life expectancy in the UnitedStates was slightly below the Organisation for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment (OECD) median in 1999 (Reinhardt et al., 2002), and in1998, the average life expectancy at birth for women was 79.5 years in theUnited States (73.9 for men), compared with 81.9 (76.9 for men) in Swedenand 84.0 (77.2 for men) in Japan (Anderson and Hussey, 2001). In 1998,the United States also ranked 28th in infant mortality among 39 industrial-ized nations (DHHS, 2002). In the area of chronic disease, reported inci- 1 The definition of public health used throughout this report is \"what we as a society do collectively to assure the conditions in which people can be healthy \" (IOM, 1988: 1). Al- though government bears special legal responsibility (discussed elsewhere in this chapter), this and similar definitions extend to more than just the activities of government, broadly refer-ring to the efforts, science, art, and approaches used by all sectors of society (public, private, and civil society) to assure, maintain, protect, promote, and improve the health of the people (IOM, 1988; Last, All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlASSURING AMERICA 'S HEALTH 21 dence rates in 1990 for all cancers2 in males and females were highest in the United States among a group of 30 industrialized nations (Jee and Or,1999). Some birth defects that appear to have links to environmental fac-tors are increasing (Pew Environmental Health Commission, 1999). Theprevalence of obesity and chronic diseases like diabetes are increasing, andinfectious disease constitutes a growing concern because of newly recog-nized or newly imported agents like West Nile virus, the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens, and the all-too-real threat of bioterrorism (DHHS,2002). Moreover, a focus on national averages often masks serious and persis- tent disparities in health status between racial and ethnic groups, men andwomen, and populations with lower and higher levels of income and educa-tion. For example, in 1999, the infant mortality rate for blacks was 14.6, alevel 2.5 times higher than that for whites (Hoyert et al., 2001). Life expect-ancy is consistently higher for women than for men, with a difference of 5.5years in 1999 (Hoyert et al., 2001). Additionally, people with less than 12years of education are twice as likely to die from chronic disease than thosewith more than 12 years of education (DHHS, 2000). Although data on the relationship between investments in health and health outcomes are not fully adequate at this time (Anderson and Hussey,2001), several trends are worth noting because they may help explain whythe nation seems to fall short of its potential. The vast majority of healthspending, as much as 95 percent by some estimates (McGinnis et al., 2002),is directed toward medical care and biomedical research. However, there isstrong evidence that behavior and environment are responsible for morethan 70 percent of avoidable mortality (McGinnis and Foege, 1993), andhealth care is just one of several determinants of health (McGinnis et al.,2002). It then follows that the nation 's heavy investment in the personal health care system 3 is a limited future strategy for promoting health. Social and environmental factors create unnecessary health risks for individualsand entire communities. Frequently, those who are most likely to be atsocial and economic disadvantage live in communities that are at higherrisk of environmental contamination, face greater exposure to intentionaland unintentional injuries, and are least likely to have access to good medi-cal care. Moreover, although the benefits of our current investments permitAmerican medicine to prevent, treat, and cure diseases, these benefits are 2 Cancer incidences of 407 per 100,000 in males and 290 per 100,000 in females.

All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html22 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH inaccessible to many because of a lack of insurance or access to services; about 14.6 percent of the population, or 41 million people, lacked healthinsurance in 2001 (Mills, 2002). HEALTH AS A SOCIAL AND POLITICAL UNDERTAKING It is hardly necessary to argue that good health is fundamental to a good society (Beauchamp, 1988). Without a certain level of health, peoplemay not be able to fully participate in many of the goods of life, includingfamily and community life, gainful employment, and participation in thepolitical process. Ethicists point to the special role that health plays in theenjoyment of an active life, a thriving community, and a productive nation(Daniels, 1985). This view is also grounded in international codes andagreements to which the United States is party, from the World HealthOrganization 's Constitution (WHO, 1946) to the United Nations ' Univer- sal Declaration of Human Rights, which ascribe intrinsic value to health. Theories of democracy demonstrate that the public 's health is an im- portant collective good because public funds are expended to benefit all ormost of the population (Walzer, 1983). The public 's health can be sup- ported only through collective action, not through individual endeavor.Acting alone, persons of means may procure personal medical services andmany of the necessities of living. Yet no single individual or group canassure the conditions needed for health. Meaningful protection and assur-ance of the population 's health require communal effort. The community as a whole has a stake in environmental protection, hygiene and sanitation,clean air, uncontaminated food and water, safe blood and pharmaceuticalproducts, and the control of infectious diseases. These collective goods, andmany more, are essential conditions for health, but these \"public \" goods can be secured only through organized action on behalf of the population(Gostin, 2000). There are solid legal, theoretical, and practical grounds for government in its various forms to assume primary responsibility for the public 's health (Duffy, 1990; Novak, 1996). Although governmental actions and agenciesconstitute the backbone of all efforts to assure the health of the public,government cannot assure population health alone; other sectors and par-ties have an interest and a civic role to help create the conditions that makehealth possible. The actors selected by the committee to illustrate their potential indi- vidual power to promote health and the role they can play in an intersectoralpublic health system include the community, the health care delivery sys-tem, business, the media, and academic institutions. Some may questionwhy the private sectors of society should act to produce \"public \" goods, such as the population 's health. To be sure, these groups do not have aCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Government regulates privateand nonprofit actors to ensure that they perform in ways that promotehealth (e.g., occupational health and safety rules, licenses, inspections, andnuisance abatements). Government provides economic incentives for en-gaging in health-promoting behavior (e.g., tax inducements to employerswho provide health care benefits) and disincentives for engaging in riskbehavior (e.g., taxes on cigarettes). Furthermore, the interest in and civicrole for private- and nonprofit sector participation in health activities hasbeen growing. For example, employers have recognized the benefits ofmaking health and safety high priorities (WBGH, 2000). When businessesand voluntary organizations support the creation and maintenance of envi-ronments that are healthy and safe, they reap additional benefits fromhaving healthy employees and satisfied consumers or clients and being goodneighbors in communities (see Chapter 6). This view of population health as an important social and political undertaking is justified by the importance of the natural (e.g., clean air andwater), built (e.g., safe and livable cities), economic (e.g., reduced socioeco-nomic and racial disparities), and informational (e.g., accurate and acces-sible health information) environments in society (Gostin, 2002). \"Healthy \" public policy is an outcome of democratic and budgetary processes, andthese political decisions should be informed by evidence, such as data show-ing the powerful influence of social and economic factors on the health ofthe population and the need to work with many partners to transform thesefactors. The collaboration of multiple actors in a public health system,broadly conceived, offers the best prospect for protecting and promotingthe nation 's health for the future. ISSUES THAT MAY SHAPE THE NATION'S HEALTH STATUS Societal Norms and Influences Faced with a mixture of satisfaction and concern about the status of population health in the United States, the committee sought possible an-swers. Although many factors may contribute to the nation 's less than stellar health, the committee believes some answers may be found in anexamination of broad historical and cultural factors that have shaped healthpolicy, planning and funding, and public perceptions and priorities abouthealth. Because health is the result of many interacting factors (see Chapter 2), it stands in the balance between economic, political, and social prioritiesand is caught in the middle of necessary and important tensions betweenrights and responsibilities \u2014individual freedoms and community or socialCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html24 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH needs, regulation, and free enterprise (Brandt and Gardner, 2000). These tensions pose complicated questions. How can the public 's health be main- tained in the face of infectious disease threats without compromising indi-vidual privacy and confidentiality? Or how can a vibrant, prosperouseconomy be supported without sacrificing health to pollutants or to occu-pational hazards? How can society balance the individual desire to pursuethe pleasures of life (e.g., food) with scientific evidence about health risk?Alternately, how are increased employment, better housing, health benefits,and an improved standard of living in a community achievable in theabsence of economic development? In addition to securing the economic,environmental, and social elements that promote good health, how canmore equitable access to them be ensured? Moreover, health is part individual good served by medicine and part public good secured by public health activities. Instead of complementaryand collaborating systems, the two disciplines, their institutional cultures,their agencies and organizations, and the public 's opinion of them have often been deeply divergent; and the individual focus of one and populationfocus of the other have become further reinforced and polarized. Often ithas been harder to motivate and accomplish the long-term changes neededin the broad environments that influence health status because of the poten-tial of immediate \"silver bullet \" solutions that can address poor personal health once it occurs. These attitudes and social influences may in partexplain three interrelated characteristics of health-related investment, policy,and practice in this country: 1. the disproportionate preeminence given to the individual over the population health approach; 2. the greater emphasis on biomedical over prevention research and on medical care over preventive services; and 3. neglect of the evidence (and of the need for more empirical re- search) about the multiple factors that shape individual and populationhealth, from the political to the environmental and from the social to thebehavioral. The personal health and health care agenda has dominated the nation 's health concerns and policy for quite some time. In fact, the majority offunding in the health care delivery system is public and there is a majorpublic investment in biomedical research, yet the United States has failed tomake the same level of commitment to population-based health promotionand disease prevention as it has to clinical care and research and biomedicaltechnologies (Starfield, 2000). Medicine has thrived within the Americaneconomic system, and its remarkable advances in improving individualhealth have garnered understandable support from the public and fromCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The public health approaches undertaken by governmental agenciesin fulfillment of their statutory obligation and with some support frompartners consistently have been underfunded and their importance in keep-ing populations healthy have been overlooked. With the decline of infec-tious disease in the twentieth century, public perception of the usefulnessand necessity of governmental public health services diminished. However,with the resurgence of infectious diseases and the escalation of chronicdiseases, as well as the newfound awareness of the multiple determinants ofpopulation health and the potential impact of macro-level and even globalthreats to health, the necessity of population-oriented approaches has be-come clearer. It has also been recognized that the infrastructure and capac-ity for such approaches must be permanent and sustained by resourcesequitably distributed between the governmental public health agencies andtheir partners and the biomedical and personal health care system. Health (or the lack thereof) is associated with a complex, and not entirely understood, interplay among innate individual factors (e.g., aperson 's sex, age, and genes), personal behavior, and a vast array of power- ful environmental conditions 4; investment and measures taken to address health needs do not give sufficient consideration to this issue. Becausehealth is influenced by these complex interactions and because many threatsto health (e.g., drug-resistant microbes or environmental contaminants)confront entire populations, protecting and assuring the population 's health requires an organized communal effort. Health care services and biomedical technologies can generally address only the immediate causes of disease \u2014for example, controlling high blood pressure to prevent heart attacks \u2014and do so on an individual basis. The fact that excellent health care exists in this country means little to millionswho lack access to it or to those who are more likely to experience poorhealth because of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status (IOM, 2002).Preventive approaches that focus on populations are based on the evidence,presented in this report and elsewhere, on the multiple factors that influ-ence health (DHHS, 2000; IOM, 2001; McGinnis et al., 2002). Thesefactors or determinants of health affect entire populations, and their im-pacts may occur long before the onset of disease or disability. Preventiveapproaches to address them may include policies that support education,adequate housing, a living wage, and clean air or that attempt to deal with 4 Environment in this case denotes the broad context of health, which includes elements of the natural (e.g., air and water), built (e.g., houses, parks, and roads), social (e.g., connected- ness and social capital), economic (e.g., income and employment), and political environments.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html26 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH some of the pervasive social and economic inequities that appear to be associated with profound disparities in health status, access, and outcomes. Furthermore, the nation has experienced deepening income disparities over the past three decades; the incomes of the poorest fifth of the popula-tion have remained static in absolute terms (Weinberg, 1996; Deaton, 2002).Because many citizens face the possibility of experiencing social and eco-nomic deprivation at some point in their lives and these problems areassociated with poorer health, society stands to benefit from the enactmentof social and economic policies that are founded on the principles of reduc-ing inequity (Mechanic, 2002). A national- or community-level commit-ment to enact socially equitable policies is more likely to result in moreequitable opportunities over a lifetime for personal and societal advance-ment and will ultimately lead to improved population health. The preceding discussion underscores the necessity of complementary and collaborative health care and population health orientations (Brandtand Gardner, 2000). Investing in population-based health promotion anddisease prevention, in concert with the attention already given to personalhealth care, can be expected to positively affect the general health statusand health outcomes of the American people (McGinnis et al., 2002). Systemic Issues In addition to issues related to social norms and influences, there are a number of systemic problems that may provide additional explanations forthe shortcomings of America 's health attainment. In 1988, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) found that the governmental component of the nation 's public health system was in disarray. The committee is seriously concernedthat despite subsequent efforts for improvement, governmental public healthagencies, the backbone of any public health system, still suffer from grave underfunding, political neglect, and continued exclusion from the very fo-rums in which their expertise and leadership are most needed to assure aneffective public health system (see Chapter 3). This calls for urgent action.The governmental public health infrastructure is built on a legal foundationreplete with obsolete and inconsistent laws and regulations, and a greatdeal of public health law is not coordinated among states and territories.This state of affairs sometimes complicates rather than facilitates govern-mental contributions to the public health system. A similar fragmentationand lack of coordination is evident in the fact that responsibility for healthissues is dispersed across several departments in the federal government andacross federal, state, and local governments, with potentially dire conse-quences for the public 's health. Although significant funding for the gov- ernmental public health infrastructure recently has been made availablespecifically to address the threat of bioterrorism, there is reason to beCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlASSURING AMERICA 'S HEALTH 27 concerned about how it will be allocated, whether it is adequate to address the needs of the infrastructure, and whether it will be sustained in the longterm, as funding decisions are often not based on evidence but, rather, onideology or considerations of political expediency (Kinney, 2002). Addi-tionally, the public health workforce is inadequate in terms of preparationfor practice (CDC/ATSDR, 2001) as well as number, partly because of localbudgetary restrictions (NACCHO, 2001). Governmental public health agencies are plagued by deficiencies in the very tools and resources that are essential to assuring population health.Until recently, many agencies had limited or no access to the Internet andelectronic mail (Fraser, 1999; Brewin, 2001) and had fragmented informa-tion systems that lacked optimal connectivity and technology. This has ledto public health surveillance systems that provide little or no population-based data on chronic disease or health problems that may signal exposureto environmental toxins. Moreover, many state public health laboratoriesare unable to keep pace with the needs for the monitoring and tracking ofknown infectious agents and became overwhelmed in the wake of newhealth threats such as the anthrax attacks and the appearance of the WestNile virus. Governmental public health agencies constitute the backbone ofthe public health system and bear primary, legally mandated responsibilityfor assuring the delivery of essential public health services. Therefore, therole of government in assuring the nation 's health is one that must be continued and sustained. Threats to the health of the population may evolveover time; but the facilities, information networks, workforce, and policiesthat form the infrastructure that protects the public 's health must be sup- ported by evidence and adequate resources. The resurgence of tuberculosis(TB) in the late 1980s offers a cautionary tale about what can happen whenthe public health infrastructure is not sustained (IOM, 2000). The successof TB prevention and treatment programs led to decreased funding andeven dismantling of TB control as a routine public health activity. In thelate 1980s, a resurgence of TB was beginning as a result of antimicrobialresistance, untreated immigrants, and the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The weak-ening of TB surveillance activities led to a massive spike in the prevalence ofthe disease and a renewed threat to the health of the public. Efforts to assure the health of the public also face important challenges in the increasingly fragile health care sector, related, among other factors,to the high number of uninsured and underinsured people. The Medicareprogram, which provides health insurance for most adults aged 65 andolder, provides little coverage for preventive services. People with mentalhealth or substance abuse problems often remain untreated. Racial andethnic minorities do not receive the same quality of care afforded to whiteAmericans, even when socioeconomic differences and other factors affect-ing access to health care are considered (IOM, 2002).

In Figure 1 -1, the committee has outlined the logic framework for this report: from the problem statement and explanation, to the parties who arecalled to address the problem, and finally, to the strategies that should beemployed to improve the current health status of the U.S. population andrespond to the challenges and seize the opportunities that the future isexpected to bring. THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM AND ITS KEY ACTORS In 1988, IOM, in its landmark report The Future of Public Health, defined public health as \"what we as a society do collectively to assure the conditions in which people can be healthy \" (IOM, 1988: 1), a definition that this committee supports and reiterates in this report. The organiza-tional mechanism for achieving the best population health \u2014the public health system \u2014was defined as encompassing \"activities undertaken within the formal structure of government and the associated efforts of private andvoluntary organizations and individuals \" (IOM, 1988: 42). While acknowl- edging the multiple participants in such an effort, the 1988 report focusedspecifically on ways to strengthen the performance of federal, state, andlocal governmental public health agencies \u2014the governmental entities whose primary mission is to promote and protect the health of the public. In the present report, the committee uses the term \"public health sys- tem\" in a manner that builds on the 1988 usage but that reflects present realities, including evidence about the determinants of health. The conceptof a public health system describes a complex network of individuals andorganizations that have the potential to play critical roles in creating theconditions for health. They can act for health individually, but when theywork together toward a health goal, they act as a system \u2014a public health system (see Figure 1 -2). Furthermore, we must assure that our health and social policies facilitate their involvement in actions for health. Actors in the Public Health System The governmental public health infrastructure (e.g., local and state health departments and laboratories), the health care delivery system, andthe public health and health sciences segments of academia are most heavilyengaged in and identified with health-related activities and are obviousactors in a public health system. There are other, less obvious actors who can shape population health by influencing and even generating the multipleCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The public health system is still not well integrated to ensure optimal communication, information transfer, and collaboration. Its components parts are also not yet fully cognizant of their roles and the need to act. The actors who can become engaged in a public health system include: Governmental public health agencies; Health care delivery system; Public health and health sciences academia; Communities; Business and employers; and The media. The importance of community organizations and associations is clear. The media was selected due to its critical importance to every aspect of life. Business and employers were selected because of their wide-ranging influence on communities, employees, and society in general.PARTNERS IN ACTION Changing societal norms and influences Increase emphasis on prevention Recognize the importance of a population approach to health improvement Acknowledge the contributions of multiple determinants of health and base policy on this evidencePOTENTIAL EXPLANATIONS Changing the public health system Strengthen the governmental public health infrastructure Forge and sustain diverse partnerships Improve accountability Develop and utilize evidence Enhance communication Improved Population Health and the Elimination of Disparities: Healthy People in Healthy CommunitiesTHE OUTCOMEPublic policy that supports health FIGURE 1 -1 Framework of the report.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The 1988 IOM report de- scribed the public health system as the activities undertaken within the formal structure of government and the associated efforts of private and voluntary organi- zations and individuals \" (IOM, 1988: 42). The report 's primary focus was the governmental public health infrastructure. In the present report, the public -private nature of the public health system is further elucidated. Although the report exam- ines the governmental public health infrastructure, some of its potential partners inan intersectoral public health system are also described. The committee has selected five actors who, together with the government public health agencies, are in a position to act powerfully for health. For the purpose of brevity, some sectors orpotential partners have been subsumed under the category of community (e.g., schools, law enforcement). The shaded ovals represent actors who can work indi- vidually or together as part of a public health system to create the conditionsnecessary to assure the best possible health for the nation. The unshaded ovals signify other sectors and entities the committee did not single out for extensive discussion.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

A corporation may see itself solely as a manufacturer, for example, yet employers and businesses influence population health in many ways:through the provision of incomes to individuals and their influences onlocal economies, workplace conditions and health-related activities, theprovision and type of employee health care benefits, environmental effects(industrial contaminants and other impacts), and the role they play incommunities and neighborhoods. A television station may see itself as asource of news and entertainment, but the media may influence populationhealth by shaping the relationships between individuals and the health caresector by conveying consumer information through broadcasts and onlineand between communities and governmental public health agencies by re-laying breaking news and risk communication. The media also shapes pub-lic opinion, knowledge, and even behavior in the way in which it useslanguage and images and also through entertainment and advertising. Com-munities \u2014schools, voluntary organizations, civic groups, local law enforce- ment and fire-fighting agencies, religious organizations, and others \u2014play multiple roles in shaping health status, in terms of promoting a socialconnectedness that may support health instrumentally or psychologically,implementing organizational efforts and activism to attain policy change,and managing or engaging in population-level health interventions. Bybringing communities, the media, and businesses and employers to thetable, they can build the knowledge and capacity needed to channel some oftheir resources toward population health improvement. This benefits every-one. Businesses and employers will have healthier workforces and construc-tive relationships with the community, the media will better serve the publicinterest, and communities will be active participants and even leaders intheir own health improvement process. As these examples demonstrate, it is not just health departments that play a role in carrying out the 10 essential public health services (see Box 1 - 1). Other sectors of society can contribute by transforming their impacts onthe public 's health so that they are no longer the result of random and unintentional actions but are the result of informed, strategic, and deliber-ate efforts to positively affect health. Roles of Public Health System Actors in Carrying Out Essential Public Health Services Achieving the vision and reaching the goals set forth by Healthy People 2010 will require the concerted and collaborative efforts of different com- ponents of society, whether it is the public sector, the private sector, stateagencies, nongovernmental entities, learning institutions, or the communityat large.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html32 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH To attain the vision of healthy people in healthy communities , we must assure that all communities, no matter how small, have access to the essen-tial public health services. All partners who can contribute to action as apublic health system should be encouraged to assess their roles and respon-sibilities, consider changes, and devise ways to better collaborate with otherpartners. They can transform the way they \"do business \" to better act to achieve a healthy population on their own and position themselves to bepart of an effective partnership in assuring the health of the population.Health policy should create incentives to make these partnerships easier. Clearly, the health care delivery system already plays an important role in providing several of the Essential Public Health Services (ESs). For ex-ample, health care providers can contribute to public health surveillanceand assessment of community health status (ESs 1 and 2), and they canemploy their resources in health promotion and education activities (ES 3).The many entities that operate within communities can collaborate withother partners to monitor health and investigate health-related needs (ESs 1and 2) and can play a dynamic role in education, empowerment, and mobi-lization for health improvement (ESs 3 and 4). Communities can also be-come involved in policy development (ES 5), either directly or indirectlythrough organizational efforts and advocacy. Academia informs, educates,and empowers people about health issues (ES 3) through partnerships withBOX 1-1 The Essential Public Health Services 1.

Academia also assures workforce competence by provid-ing high-quality education and training (ES 8), in addition to its substantialroles in evaluation and research (ESs 9 and 10). America 's businesses and employers have the opportunity to promote health and prevent disease anddisability in their own workforces (ES 3). Employers are also a criticalsource of health care payment for personal health care services (ES 7).Furthermore, because businesses are closely involved with communities,they can collaborate in partnerships that monitor, identify, and addresscommunity health problems (ESs 1 and 4). Finally, the mass media caneducate, inform, and thus empower (ES 3) communities with accurate andtimely health communications. PRESENT AND FUTURE CHANGES NEEDED FOR A HEALTHY NATION The committee 's findings call attention to the fact that achieving the vision of healthy people in healthy communities is a difficult and complex task that cannot be accomplished through a single plan of action or by asingle governmental agency or nongovernmental entity. Rather, broad soci-etal action is required at every level; and such action needs to be bettercoordinated by all individuals, families and community members, busi-nesses and workers, and health care providers and policy makers. Further-more, responding to this vision requires a long-term public and politicalcommitment to ensure that the policies, financial and organizational re-sources, and political and public wills are in place to assure the presence ofthe conditions necessary for all Americans to live longer, healthier lives. Tosupport the creation of an effective intersectoral public health system, thecommittee identified six areas of action and change. These are reflected inthe recommendations made to the potential public health system actorsdescribed in this report, but they are equally applicable to other compo-nents of the public health system not specifically addressed. Action andchange are needed to: 1. Adopt a population health approach that builds on evidence of the multiple determinants of health; 2. Strengthen the governmental public health infrastructure \u2014the backbone of any public health system; 3. Create a new generation of partnerships to build consensus on health priorities and support community and individual health actions; 4. Develop appropriate systems of accountability at all levels to en- sure that population health goals are met;Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html34 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH 5. Assure that action is based on evidence ; and 6. Acknowledge communication as the key to forging partnerships, assuring accountability, and utilizing evidence for decision making andaction. The unique responsibility of government to assure action for health has been discussed and will be discussed further. The essence of the intersectoralpublic health system described in this report is partnerships linking thosewho contribute their expertise, resources, and perspectives to the process ofassuring population health. Government agencies are subject to more for-mal systems of accountability through the political process, yet the successof specific activities for health depends on the setting of standards forprogram and workforce performance and in meeting the needs of the popu-lations served. Emphasizing evidence as the basis for policies and programsacknowledges that information and data should form the basis for effectiveplanning and decision making at all levels and among all partners withinthe public health system. There is strong and growing evidence that\"healthy \" public policy must include consideration of domains that are not traditionally associated with health but whose influences have health conse-quences (e.g., the education, business, housing, and transportation do-mains). Finally, improving communications is an essential component inthe activities of all potential public health system actors. Improving com-munications capacity will involve, among other things, investment of re-sources, efficient adoption of cutting-edge technologies, training of work-ers, and even change in institutional cultures. The vision of healthy people in healthy communities can be achieved only if the governmental backbone of the public health system is strong;intersectoral partnerships create environments and conditions conducive tothe best population health; accountability is valued and practiced by allstakeholders; evidence is effectively developed, shared, and translated intopractice; and effective communication becomes a priority among all publichealth partners. In the next section, we describe a number of contextualchanges and trends that will influence the kinds of health problems we willface as a society and the strategies we select to address them. BROAD TRENDS INFLUENCING THE NATION 'S HEALTH This report examines some reasons for the nation 's current health sta- tus and proposes measures and actors that will help improve and continu-ally assure the nation 's health in the future. As noted, there is a need to transform social norms and strengthen the potential for more effectivepartnerships within a public health system to ensure that they will promoteand protect population health. A number of factors create both opportuni-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

These include (1) population growth and demographic change (a population growing larger, older, andmore racially and ethnically diverse, with a higher incidence of chronicdisease); (2) unprecedented technological and scientific advances that createnew channels for information and communication, as well as novel ways ofpreventing and treating disease; and (3) the geopolitical and economic chal-lenge of globalization, including international terrorism (Brownson Koplan and Fleming, 2000; 2000). Some of these factors offer unprecedented opportunitiesfor global and national health improvement, whereas others pose threatsthat make it more difficult to achieve the best conditions necessary for thenation 's health. Population Growth and Demographic Change The U.S. population will become much grayer in the twenty-first cen- tury, and strengthening community and individual capacities and resourcesto support good health at all ages will be essential. As the Baby Boomgeneration ages into retirement, the proportion of the U.S. population overage 65 is projected to reach 13.3 percent by 2010 and 18.5 percent by 2025(Bureau of the Census, 1996; Campbell, 1997). In 21 states, the elderlypopulation is expected to at least double between 1995 and 2025 (Campbell,1997). The nation has also seen a doubling of the number of centenarians,from 30,000 to 60,000, over the past several years (Portnoi, 1999). The graying of America doubtlessly will be accompanied by some changes in the population 's needs for health care, long-term care, and other services. This trend especially underscores the importance of services andsocial supports to promote healthy aging. Although care needs for theelderly have declined somewhat in recent years, there are concerns aboutsociety 's ability to respond effectively to the needs of this demographic group (Wolf, 2001). An aging population will require effective means ofchronic disease prevention and management to help older people maintainthe best possible levels of health and function. Although some health prob-lems may be inevitable because of biologic and genetic factors, research ispointing to new opportunities for promoting health at older ages (Fried,2000). For example, community-based interventions to support behavioralchanges such as increases in physical activity and good nutrition may par-tially reverse some health damage and may help prevent the occurrence ofadditional problems (Andrews, 2001). Furthermore, earlier investments inhealth promotion and disease prevention could produce benefits at youngerages, before irreparable damage has occurred and before the chances forhealthful, functional aging are reduced (Khaw, 1997; Andrews, 2001). Also,public policy could expand the social, economic, and lifestyle options avail-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html36 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH able to aging populations (Jacobzone, 2000). Aging healthfully promises not only psychosocial benefits and the ability to remain functional andindependent for as long as possible but may also result in medical costsavings (Reed et al., 1998). The increasing number of elderly Americans will also draw increased attention to the need (shared by many others, including children and citydwellers) for adequate housing, safe and appropriate urban design, and foreasily accessible transportation systems that allow for the continuation ofboth subsistence activities like grocery shopping and social interactions likeparticipation in senior citizens ' groups (NRC, 2001). Moreover, it has already given rise to a well-defined political constituency (e.g., throughorganizations like the American Association of Retired Persons [AARP])and can be expected to influence the medical and population-level healthresearch agendas (NRC, 2001). The United States is also becoming more racially and ethnically diverse through both immigration and natural growth (Day, 1996). The propor-tion of the population accounted for by Hispanics, African Americans,Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans is expected torise from 28 percent in 2000 to 32 percent by 2010 (IFTF, 2000). Althoughdiversity enriches American culture and strengthens America 's democracy, it also challenges the systems that traditionally have provided for the healthand welfare of American society. For example, minority groups areunderrepresented among the population of health care professionals, andmany health care workers are not sufficiently skilled in the delivery ofculturally competent care. Additionally, the health system itself (as thebroader sociocultural environment in which it is embedded) is character-ized by complex undercurrents of pervasive inequities and institutionalracism, which lead to stereotypes, biases, and uncertainties that result inunequal treatment of racial and ethnic minority patients (IOM, 2002). Newimmigrant groups also bring their own perceptions about the role of gov-ernment, the meaning of community, and the definition of health and ill-ness; and these must be considered in creating better ways to achieve ahealthy nation. Continuing disparities in health status and the outcomes of health care demonstrate the need for a greater effort to ensure equitable access to andservices from the health care delivery system for people of different back-grounds (IOM, 2002). With an increasingly diverse population, the nationwill need a more highly developed knowledge base concerning the socialdeterminants of health and a continuing reassessment and improved under-standing of the ways in which social, cultural, and ecological factors shapehealth behaviors and influence health status (IFTF, 2000).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlASSURING AMERICA 'S HEALTH 37 Technological and Scientific Advances In this age of technology, the acquisition of new scientific knowledge and capabilities is occurring at unprecedented speed. However, the newknowledge and capabilities in fields like biotechnology also carry ethical,social, and economic ramifications, and raise concerns about the risks ofnew technologies (Khoury et al., 2000). Some advances, like highly sophis-ticated medical instruments and better pharmaceuticals, seem most perti-nent to the personal health care delivery system, but others are highlyrelevant for the protection of population health. Developments in genetics,for example, have shed new light on disease causation, thus providing newopportunities for intervention for disease prevention and health promotion(Khoury et al., 2000; Omenn, 2000). Genomics is expected to transform the practice of medicine from dis- ease screening and diagnostics to treatment. In fact, some health care maycome to involve the detection of disease at the gene level, permitting preven-tive treatment before the disease even begins to unfold (Pricewater-houseCoopers, 1999). However, the promise of genetics is constrained byan incomplete understanding of interactions among genes and betweengenes and the environment (Austin et al., 2000). This not only poses re-search challenges but also raises other contentious issues concerning thecauses of ill health, personal rights and responsibilities, and the possibilityof achieving health equity. For example, can individual choices and behav-iors be leveraged against genetic heritage and broader ecological factors ina way that is fair? Additionally, new genetic technologies may compromiseefforts to improve overall population health if they lead to the stigmatiza-tion and exclusion of certain groups. Furthermore, genetic testing raises acomplexity of issues regarding matters such as privacy, cost, employment,and insurability. Ultimately, the benefits of genetic research must be weighedagainst, and perhaps considered in conjunction with, interventions on be-havioral and population-level factors in disease causation (Willett, 2002). The technological advances in the medical and biological sciences are only rivaled by the recent decade 's rapid developments in information and communication technology. The increase in personal computer use andaccess to the ever-expanding offerings of the Internet present both opportu-nities and challenges to the goal of improving the health of the population.The Internet is a ready and popular medium for exchanging health informa-tion and news and for facilitating political and group mobilization to influ-ence policy. Although the wider availability of health information mayempower and inform consumers, erroneous or misleading information mayalso pose a danger to health. The partners in the public health system must ensure that emerging communication and information technologies are used effectively to pro-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Public health partners must also become engaged in countering or critiquing media and socialmessages, products, and patterns that are potentially detrimental to health.Such a responsibility implies that health departments, health care deliverysystems, and perhaps others engaged in population-oriented health effortswill be expected to construct and maintain a presence on the World WideWeb and use cyber methodologies to educate and inform consumers andcommunities. The public health system must gain greater skills to meet thechallenge of using the mass media to promote health and to keep pace withthe communication revolution. In this Information Age, high-quality websites, e-newsletters, and Internet Q-and-A columns may become the pri-mary means of delivering health messages, replacing the familiar brochuresand posters. U.S. technological expertise creates an important international dimen- sion. The United States is a magnet for foreign graduate students in sci-ence, technology, and health, American specialists are a cornerstone of theinternational health community, and the nation is a world leader in high-technology exports. The National Research Council report The Pervasive Role of Science, Technology, and Health in Foreign Policy considers sci- ence, technology, and health developments as \"such a pervasive force, they cannot be isolated from the fundamental concept of foreign policy \" (NRC, 1999: 2). The report calls on the leadership of the State Department totake a series of steps to increase the department 's capability to identify and act on science, technology, and health opportunities in countries of strate-gic importance and to coordinate these efforts within the department andwith other cabinet agencies. Globalization and Health The increasing diversity of the average American community is an illustration of what has been occurring on the global scale as people withvarious backgrounds, nationalities, and ethnicities are migrating or work-ing in places far from their native lands and diverse languages and culturesmix and mingle in cities, towns, and suburbs. Globalization is reflected inboth positive and negative developments that include increased trade, travel,migration and demographic changes, food security issues, environmentaldegradation and unsustainable consumption patterns, the evolution anddissemination of technology and communications, and an increasingly glo-bal media (Navarro, 1998; Yach and Bettcher, 1998). Globalization is a strong influence on population-level health both locally and internationally, and its ultimate impact will depend on society 's response (Beaglehole and Bonita, 1998; McMichael and Beaglehole, 2000).Global health issues include, for example, health risks arising from certainCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

There are other factors that are (to variousdegrees) regulated at national borders, such as food and pharmaceuticalquality and safety and the ability of health professionals to practice incountries other than those in which they were trained (Lee, 2001). In addi-tion, socioeconomic determinants of health, such as income and employ-ment status, are often influenced by the global economy. The liberalizationof trade may benefit health status and outcomes by facilitating the diffusionof biomedical technologies and international food and agricultural safetystandards (Bettcher et al., 2000). However, greater openness to trade mayalso have negative implications if the global economy engages in practicesdetrimental to health; examples include the export of tobacco products indeveloping world markets and the production and dumping of environmen-tal toxins such as methylmercury (Keigher and Lowery, 1998; Sen andBonita, 2000). Information and communication technologies, especially those that use the Internet, are increasing at such a scope and rate that they are criticalinfluences on populations through their transmission of knowledge. Theireffects on health can range from making the most esoteric specialists avail-able for consultation virtually anywhere in the world, to providing up-to-date scientific literature to isolated researchers and clinicians, to providinginformation directly to the public about health and illness. Barriers torealizing the health benefits of a global information society were identifiedin an expert survey reported for project G8-ENABLE, sponsored by theEuropean Institute for Health and Medical Sciences in Surrey, United King-dom. These barriers include the security of personal information, datastandardization, intellectual property and reports, and network and mes-saging technologies, as well as education, culture, and cost (Rogers andReardon, 1999). Aside from concerns about exacerbation of the knowledgegap between developed and developing countries, communication, espe-cially popular culture reflected in the entertainment media, can create im-ages and expose a population to behaviors that may introduce unhealthypractices (e.g., in diet and risk behavior) into cultures previously free ofthem. With the increasing cross-border flows of people, pharmaceuticals, and food, countries cannot adequately protect their populations through unilat-eral domestic or foreign policy action; they must collaborate with othercountries and within the frameworks of international agreements. TheWorld Health Organization is a forum for setting standards and developingprotocols on issues like international travel health standards, tobacco con-trol (the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control), the quality of phar-maceuticals, and food quality and safety. Several issues may benefit fromhigh levels of involvement from countries like the United States, with itsCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html40 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH wealth and scientific expertise. These issues include a lack of funding for research on diseases and injuries that disproportionately affect the develop-ing world (i.e., the \"10/90 gap \" [Davey, 2000]), the weakness in the re- search infrastructure in many developing countries, and the need to addressissues of intellectual property involved in making basic drugs available tonations without their own production capacity. Some have rightly urged that health should be included in America 's core foreign policy agenda (Kassalow, 2001) and that our nation mustbecome engaged in matters of global health law (Fidler, 2002). In someinstances like bioterrorism and infectious diseases it is a matter of nationalsecurity, and in others it is a matter of national self-interest and positiveidentity (IOM, 1997). National-level assessments and policies regarding thehealth of the population must consider global factors, porous borders, andincreasingly mobile people and germs. Historically overshadowed by tradeand military issues, the health of the public has in recent years gainedpreeminence as an issue of national security. This turn of events has beenprecipitated by the global devastation wrought by HIV/AIDS, the emer-gence and reemergence of infectious disease, concerns about states thatdevelop and accumulate biological weapons, and fear of bioterrorism(Fidler, 2002). Concern about global health issues led to an unprecedentedsession of the United Nations Security Council in 1999 \u2014the first ever on a health issue \u2014on the global threat of HIV/AIDS. A public -private Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, malaria, and TB was established to provide re-sources to tackle these threats effectively; however, funding commitmentsto date have fallen far short of the goal. In fact, the current average overseasdevelopment aid funds are about 0.2 percent of the gross national productof industrialized countries, well below the 0.7 percent goal agreed uponinternationally. U.S. spending is below the average (Kaul and Faust, 2001). As world economies have become interconnected and interdependent, global health can no longer remain the domain of a few specialists becauseits repercussions are significant for our economy, our place in the world,and the cultural and human heritage that the populations of the worldshare. Microbes can weaken national security, impair economies, and de-stabilize societies. Surveillance efforts, public health research, the trainingof the workforce, the scope of laboratory activities, and local public healthactivities should all reflect the global community of which the United Statesis a part and the global threats and opportunities that the nation and theworld confront. Although this committee was convened to consider the best ways to assure the nation 's health in the new century, America is connected to the world through trade, travel, migration, and communication. In a sense, therecommendations put forth in this report have some relevance to consider-ations of global health.

The future challenges just outlined are complex and far reaching. It is imperative that a strong public health system, with engaged partners, be inplace to deal with these challenges if we are to promote and protect thenation 's health today and tomorrow. CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS Health is shaped by both innate factors (e.g., genes, age, and sex) and other influences from the social, economic, natural, built, and politicalenvironments, ranging from the availability of shelter and food to questionsof social connectedness and behavior. These multiple determinants of health,among others, constitute a reality that makes it impossible for one entity orone sector alone to bring about population health improvement. Thebroader efforts of many sectors and entities are needed within the contextof a larger societal commitment to health. This commitment must be re-flected in policies and programs at the national, state, and local levels thatengage a broad spectrum of society \u2014individual citizens and nongovern- mental entities, health care providers, businesses, academic institutions, themedia, and others \u2014to work effectively together as a public health system and individually to create the conditions that allow people in the UnitedStates to be as healthy as they can be. Such a commitment will requirepolitical will that has yet to be mobilized. Before exploring in more depth the potential role of each partner in the public health system, it is important to review the broad determinants ofhealth that operate at the community and the societal levels to influence thehealth of individuals and populations.

Assuring the health of the public, however, goes beyond focus-ing on the health status of individuals; it requires a population healthapproach. As noted in Chapter 1, America's health status does not matchthe nation's substantial health investments. The work of assuring thenation's health also faces dramatic change, systemic problems, and chal-lenging societal norms and influences. Given these issues, the committeebelieves that it is necessary to transform national health policy, whichtraditionally has been grounded in a concern for personal health servicesand biomedical research that benefits the individual. Such repositioningwill affirm and expand existing commitments to reflect a broader perspec-tive. Approaching health from a population perspective commits the nationto understanding and acting on the full array of factors that affect health. To best address the social, economic, and cultural environments at national, state, and local levels, the nation's efforts must involve more thanjust the traditional sectors\u2014the governmental public health agencies andthe health care delivery system. As has been outlined in the preceding pages,what is needed is the creation of an effective intersectoral public healthsystem. Furthermore, the efforts of the public health system must be sup-ported by political will\u2014which comes from elected officials who commitresources and influence based on evidence\u2014and by \"healthy\" publicpolicy\u2014which comes from governmental agencies that consider health ef-fects in developing agriculture, education, commerce, labor, transportation,and foreign policy. This chapter describes the rationale behind a transformed approach toCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlUNDERSTANDING POPULATION HEALTH AND ITS DETERMINANTS 47 addressing population health problems. This approach identifies key deter- minants of the nation 's health and presents evidence for their consideration in developing effective national strategies to assure population health andsupport the development of a public health system that blends the strengthsand resources of diverse sectors and partners (IOM, 1997). A POPULATION PERSPECTIVE For nations to improve the health of their populations, some have cogently argued, they need to move beyond clinical interventions with high-risk groups. This concept was best articulated by Rose (1992), who notedthat \"medical thinking has been largely concerned with the needs of sick individuals. \" Although this reflects an important mission for medicine and health care, it is a limited one that does little to prevent people frombecoming sick in the first place, and it typically has disregarded issuesrelated to disparities in access to and quality of preventive and treatmentservices. Personal health care is only one, and perhaps the least powerful, ofseveral types of determinants of health, among which are also includedgenetic, behavioral, social, and environmental factors (IOM, 2000;McGinnis et al., 2002). To modify these, the nation and the intersectoralpublic health system must identify and exploit the full potential of newoptions and strategies for health policy and action. Three realities are central to the development of effective population- based prevention strategies. First, disease risk is currently conceived of as acontinuum rather than a dichotomy. There is no clear division between riskfor disease and no risk for disease with regard to levels of blood pressure,cholesterol, alcohol consumption, tobacco consumption, physical activity,diet and weight, lead exposure, and other risk factors. In fact, recommendedcutoff points for management or treatment of many of these risk factors havechanged dramatically and in a downward direction over time (e.g., guidelinesfor control of \"hypertension \" and cholesterol), in acknowledgment of the increased risk associated with common moderately elevated levels of a givenrisk factor. This continuum of risk is also apparent for many social andenvironmental conditions as well (e.g., socioeconomic status, social isolation,work stress, and environmental exposures). Any population model of preven-tion should be built on the recognition that there are degrees of risk ratherthan just two extremes of exposure (i.e., risk and no risk). The second reality is that most often only a small percentage of any population is at the extremes of high or low risk. The majority of people fallin the middle of the distribution of risk. Rose (1981, 1992) observed thatexposure of a large number of people to a small risk can yield a moreabsolute number of cases of a condition than exposure of a small number ofpeople to a high risk. This relationship argues for the development ofCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html48 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC'S HEALTH strategies that focus on the modification of risk for the entire population rather than for specific high-risk individuals. Rose (1981) termed the pre-ventive approach the \"prevention paradox \" because it brings large benefits to the community but offers little to each participating individual. In otherwords, such strategies would move the entire distribution of risk to lowerlevels to achieve maximal population gains. The third reality, provided by Rose 's (1992) population perspective, is that an individual 's risk of illness cannot be considered in isolation from the disease risk for the population to which he or she belongs. Thus, someonein the United States is more likely to die prematurely from a heart attackthan someone living in Japan, because the population distribution of highcholesterol in the United States as a whole is higher than the distribution inJapan (i.e., on a graph of the distribution of cholesterol levels in a popula-tion, the U.S. mean is shifted to the right of the Japanese mean). Applyingthe population perspective to a health measure means asking why a popula-tion has the existing distribution of a particular risk, in addition to askingwhy a particular individual got sick (Rose, 1992). This is critical, becausethe greatest improvements in a population 's health are likely to derive from interventions based on the first question. Because the majority of cases ofillness arise within the bulk of the population outside the extremes of risk,prevention strategies must be applicable to a broad base of the population.American society experienced this approach to disease prevention and healthpromotion in the early twentieth century, when measures were taken topromote sanitation and food and water safety (CDC, 1999b), and in morerecent policies on seat belt use, unleaded gasoline, vaccination, and waterfluoridation, some of which are discussed later in this chapter. The committee recognizes that achieving the goal of improving popula- tion health requires balancing of the strategies aimed at shifting the distri-bution of risk with other approaches. The committee does, however, en-dorse a much wider examination, and ultimately the development, of newpopulation-based strategies. Three graphs illustrate different models forrisk reduction (see Figure 2 -1). These hypothetical models assume etiological links exist among all exposures and disease outcomes. Figure 2 -1a shows the effects of an inter- vention aimed at reducing the risk of those in the highest-risk category. Inthis example, people with the highest body mass index (BMI) 1 are at in- 1 Body mass index is a measure of body fat based on height and weight (kilograms divided by meters squared, kg/m2). A person with a BMI of between 18.5 and 24.9 would be consid- ered of normal weight, whereas a person with a BMI of between 25 and 29.9 would be considered overweight, and someone with a BMI of 30 or greater would be classified asobese. BMIs above normal are associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. A person 's BMI is influenced by genes, behavior, the environment, and interactions among these factors.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Intervening medically, for example, to decrease risk (by loweringlevels of obesity, as measured by BMI) ultimately decreases the proportionof the population with the highest BMIs. Such measures among very high-risk individuals may even be endorsed in cases where the \"intervention \" itself carries a substantial risk of poor outcome or side effects. However,use of such an intervention would be acceptable only in those whose medi-cal risk was very high. Moreover, interventions in high-risk groups mayhave a limited effect on population outcomes because the greater propor-tion of those with moderate risk levels may ultimately translate into morechronic disease or other poor health outcomes. Figure 2 -1b illustrates Rose 's classic model whereby the greatest ben- efit is achieved by shifting the entire distribution of risk to a lower level ofrisk. Because most people are in categories of moderately elevated risk asopposed to very high risk, this strategy offers the greatest benefit in terms ofpopulation-attributable risk, assuming that the intervention itself carrieslittle or no risk. The hypothetical example shows what might occur if socialpolicies or other population-wide measures were adopted to promote smalldecreases in weight in the general population. The committee embraces thiskind of model of disease prevention in the case of policies such as seat beltregulation and the reduction of lead levels in gasoline. The final hypothetical model (Figure 2 -1c), although not discussed by Rose explicitly, illustrates a reduction in the distributions of those at high-est and lowest risk with no change in the distribution of those with a meanlevel of risk. This model is appropriate for illustrating phenomena relatingto inequality, where redistribution of some good (e.g., income, education,housing, or health care) reduces inequality without necessarily changing themean of the distribution of that good. One hypothetical example is theassociation between low income and poor health. In many cases, there is acurvilinear association between these goods and health outcomes, withdecreased health gains experienced by those at the upper bounds of thedistribution. For example, data on income suggest that there are largedifferences in the health gains achieved per dollar earned for those at thelower end of the income distribution and fewer differences in the healthgains achieved per dollar earned for those at the upper end. Thus, thecurvilinear association, if it were a causal one, would suggest that substan-tial gains in population-level health outcomes may be achieved by a redistri-bution of some resources without actual changes in the means. These graphs help to illustrate three different strategies for improving the health of the population. The nation has often endorsed the first strat-egy without a critical examination of the other two, especially the secondone. The American public has grown accustomed to seeing differences inexposures to risk, both environmental and behavioral, and disparities inCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Acknowledging these gradients fully will help develop true population-based intervention strategies and help the partners whocollaborate to assure the public 's health move to take effective actions and make effective policies. Understanding and ultimately improving a population 's health rest not only on understanding this population perspective but also on understandingthe ecology of health and the interconnectedness of the biological, behav-ioral, physical, and socioenvironmental domains. In some ways, conven-tional public health models (e.g., the agent -host-environment triad) have long emphasized an ecological understanding of disease prevention. Enor-mous gains in the control and eradication of infectious diseases rested upon adeep understanding of the ecology of specific agents and the power of envi-ronmental interventions rather than individual or behavioral interventions tocontrol disease. For example, in areas where sanitation and water purifica-tion are poor, individual behaviors, such as hand washing and boiling ofwater, are emphasized to reduce the spread of disease. However, when envi-ronmental controls become feasible, it is easy to move to a more \"upstream \" 2 intervention (like municipal water purification) to improve health. The last several decades of research have resulted in a deeper understanding not onlyof the physical dimensions of the environment that are toxic but also of abroad range of related conditions in the social environment that are factors increating poor health. These social determinants challenge the discipline ofpublic health to more fully incorporate them. Over the past decade, several models have been developed to illustrate the determinants of health and the ecological nature of health (e.g., seeDahlgren and Whitehead [1991], Evans and Stoddart [1990], and Appen-dix A). Many of these models have been developed in the United Kingdom,Canada, and Scandinavia, where population approaches have started toshape governmental and public health policies. The committee has built onthe Dahlgren-Whitehead model \u2014which also guided the Independent In- quiry into Inequalities in Health in the United Kingdom \u2014modifying it to reflect special issues of relevance in the United States (see Figure 2 -2). This figure serves as a useful heuristic to help us think about the multiple deter-minants of population health. It may, for instance, help to illustrate howthe health sector, which includes governmental public health agencies andthe health care delivery system, must work with other sectors of govern-ment such as education, labor, economic development, and agriculture to 2 Upstream refers to determinants of health that are somewhat removed from the more \"downstream \" biological and behavioral bases for disease. Such upstream determinants in- clude \"social relations, neighborhoods and communities, institutions, and social and eco- nomic policies \" (IOM, 2000).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Macro-level or upstream determi-nants (such as policies and societal norms) and micro-level determinants(such as sex or the virulence of a disease agent) interact along complex anddynamic pathways to produce health at a population level. As mentionedabove, exposures at the environmental level may have a greater influenceon population health than individual vulnerabilities, although at an indi-vidual level, personal characteristics including genetic predispositions inter-act with the environment to produce disease. For instance, smoking is acomplex biobehavioral activity with both significant genetic heritabilityand nongenetic, environmental influences, and many studies have shown aninteraction between smoking and specific genes in determining the risk ofdeveloping cardiovascular disease and cancers. It is also important to notethat developmental and historical conditions change over time at both asocietal level (e.g., demographic changes) and an individual level (e.g., lifecourse issues) and that disease itself evolves as agents change in virulence. In the pages that follow, the committee provides a concise discussion of the key determinants that constitute the ecology of health, including envi-ronmental and social determinants, and elaborates in more detail on thesocial influences on health. This decision was made in recognition of alonger history in studying the ways in which environment shapes popula-tion health. THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT AS A DETERMINANT OF HEALTH At least since the time of Hippocrates ' essay \"Air, Water and Places, \" written in 400 B.C.E., humans have been aware of the many connectionsbetween health and the environment. Improved water, food, and milk sani-tation, reduced physical crowding, improved nutrition, and central heatingwith cleaner fuels were the developments most responsible for the greatadvances in public health achieved during the twentieth century. Theseadvantages of a developed nation are taken for granted, but in fact, theycould deteriorate without adequate support of the governmental publichealth infrastructure. Environmental health problems, historically local in their effects and short in duration, have changed dramatically within the last 25 years.Today 's problems are also persistent and global. Together, global warming, population growth, habitat destruction, loss of green space, and resourcedepletion have produced a widely acknowledged environmental crisis(NRC, 1999). These long-term environmental problems are not amenableto quick technical fixes, and their resolution will require community andCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

At the local and community levels, environmental issues are equally complex and are also related to a range of socioeconomicfactors. A brief look at some of the evidence on environmental determi-nants of health may help shed some light on why health is not equallyshared. The importance of \"place \" to health status became increasingly clear in the last decades of the twentieth century. The places in which people workand live have an enormous impact on their health. The characteristics ofplace include the social and economic environments, as well as the naturalenvironment (e.g., air, water) and the built environment, which may in-clude transportation, buildings, green spaces, roads, and other infrastruc-ture (IOM, 2001b). Environmental hazards in workplaces and communi-ties may range from tobacco smoke to pesticides to toxic housing. Ruralareas may present increased health risks from pesticides and other environ-mental exposures, whereas some environmental threats to health can occurbecause of urban living conditions. More than three-quarters of Americans live in urban areas (Bureau of the Census, 1993). Although rural Americans experience certain health-related disadvantages (e.g., health care access issues due to transportationand availability) (Slifkin et al., 2000; NCHS, 2001), some of the healtheffects of the inner city (i.e., decay and crime) are often dramatic and maybe related to broader social issues. The \"urban health penalty \"\u2014the \"greater prevalence of a large number of health problems and risk factors in cities than in suburbs and rural areas \" (Leviton et al., 2000: 863) \u2014has been frequently discussed and studied (Lawrence, 1999; Freudenberg, 2000;Geronimus, 2000). A variety of political, socioeconomic, and environmen-tal factors shape the health status of cities and their residents by influencing\"health behaviors such as exercise, diet, sexual behavior, alcohol and sub- stance use \" (Freudenberg, 2000: 837). The negative environmental aspects of urban living \u2014toxic buildings, proximity to industrial parks, and a lack of parks or green spaces, among others \u2014likely affect those who are already at an economic and social disadvantage because of the concentration ofsuch negative aspects in specific pockets of poverty and deprivation(Lawrence, 1999; Maantay, 2001; Williams and Collins, 2001). Urbandwellers may experience higher levels of air pollution, which is associatedwith higher levels of cardiovascular and respiratory disease (Hoek et al.,2001; Ibald-Mulli et al., 2001; Peters et al., 2001). People who live in agingbuildings and in crowded and unsanitary conditions may also experienceincreased levels of lead in their blood, as well as asthma and allergies(Pertowski, 1994; Pew Environmental Health Commission, 2000; CDC,2001a). These examples illustrate some of the profound effects of the physi-cal environment on health. The places where people live may expose themto harmful factors.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

High levels ofexposure to certain environmental pollutants are known to cause acuteeffects including convulsions, paralysis, coma, and death. The effects oflead on health and development have been documented for decades, andpolicy action regarding leaded gasoline and lead-based paints has beentaken, with positive effects on child health. However, there is growingconcern about emerging evidence that other ubiquitous pollutants such aspolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury may cause behavioral prob-lems and affect mood and social adjustment. The adverse impacts of expo-sure to these pollutants may be most profound during fetal developmentand early childhood. Amidst growing national concern about developmen-tal disabilities, exposure to mercury in the environment represents an emerg-ing and preventable environmental health threat. The National Research Council (NRC) report Toxicological Effects of Methylmercury (NRC, 2000) examined the evidence of adverse health im- pacts resulting from exposure to mercury, focusing on consumption ofseafood contaminated by releases to the environment. Fossil fuel combus-tion represents the major source of mercury released to the environment.The deposition of mercury on the land and in surface waters results inconversion to forms that accumulate in the food chain. This bioaccumula-tion can result in very high concentrations of mercury in some fish, whichare the main source of exposure for the population. The developing brain isparticularly sensitive to the adverse effects of mercury exposure. Prenatalexposures may interfere with the growth and development of neurons andcause irreversible damage to the nervous system. Infants whose mothers wereexposed to high levels in poisoning episodes in Minamata, Japan, and in Iraqwere born with severe disabilities, including mental retardation, cerebralpalsy, blindness, and deafness (EPA, 1997; NRC, 2000). More recently,epidemiological studies of lower-level exposure from maternal fish consump-tion have raised concerns about subtle neurodevelopmental deficits. The NRC report concluded that the evidence of developmental neuro- toxic effects from mercury exposure is strong and called for revision ofthe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reference dose that providespublic health guidance on acceptable population exposure levels. Thisconclusion was based on epidemiological studies of low-level chronicexposure from seafood consumption. The population at risk consists ofwomen of childbearing age and their children. Frequent consumers, par-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Based upon theavailable data on fish consumption, the NRC committee estimated that asmany as 60,000 newborns may be at risk for adverse neurodevelopmentaleffects from in utero exposure to mercury. Recently, the Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the first National ExposureReport, which provided dramatic confirmation of the emerging threat ofmercury. Ten percent of a national sample of women of childbearing agehad mercury levels in their blood within 1/10 of potentially hazardouslevels, indicating a narrow margin of safety for many women (CDC,2001c). Currently, 40 states have issued fish consumption advisories to reduce exposure to mercury. EPA and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)have also recently revised their guidance concerning consumption of fishspecies that have been shown to have high levels of mercury. Ultimately, thethreat of mercury can be most effectively reduced through control of thesources of pollution. However, control of sources from the burning of fossilfuels may be decades away. In the meantime, prevention of adverse publichealth impacts from mercury will require a partnership among health careproviders, public health agencies, and others. The example of methylmercury clearly illustrates the serious impact of just one environmental risk factor. The influences of many other environ-mental risk factors on health have not been fully documented, and evidenceof the influence of environmental factors for some health conditions likeasthma is rapidly accumulating (Trust for America 's Health, 2001). The association between certain chronic diseases and environmental causes isdevastatingly clear, yet knowledge about the scope of environmental healthrisks and their impact on the public 's health is limited. Most states do not track environmental risk factors like pesticides and other hazards or mostchronic diseases (such as asthma) and birth defects (Pew EnvironmentalHealth Commission, 2001). Certainly, a significant amount of work re-mains to be done to address the physical environment 's powerful influence on health status. A great deal about health determinants in the built andnatural environments has been learned in recent decades, but much more isyet to be examined. THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH Most recently, social epidemiologists and other researchers have fo- cused on identifying the social equivalents of leaded gasoline and environ-mental tobacco smoke. Among the greatest advances in understanding thefactors that shape population health over the last two decades, and clearlyCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlUNDERSTANDING POPULATION HEALTH AND ITS DETERMINANTS 57 since the last Institute of Medicine (IOM, 1988) report on the health of the public, has been the identification of social and behavioral conditions thatinfluence morbidity, mortality, and functioning. The evidence amassed strongly and consistently points to the impor- tance of these conditions as significant determinants of population health.Because they also feature prominently in the committee 's determinants-of- health model, the evidence related to four conditions whose importance isrobustly supported is reviewed here: (1) socioeconomic position, (2) raceand ethnicity, (3) social networks and social support, and (4) work condi-tions. Additionally, we discuss the evidence related to a fifth condition thathas been and that still is the subject of great interest as well as controversy:ecological-level influences, namely, economic inequality and social capi-tal. 3 The present analysis reviews key evidence related to these five condi- tions that has been presented more extensively in Health and Behavior (IOM, 2001). Socioeconomic Status and Health A strong and consistent finding of epidemiological research is that there are health differences among socioeconomic groups. Lower mortality, mor-bidity, and disability rates among socioeconomically advantaged peoplehave been observed for hundreds of years; and in recent decades, theseobservations have been replicated using various indicators of socioeco-nomic status (SES) and multiple disease outcomes (Syme and Berkman,1976; Kaplan and Keil, 1993). SES is defined in terms of education, income,and occupation. Furthermore, educational differentials in mortality haveincreased in the United States over the past three decades, leading to agrowing inequality, even though mortality rates have dropped for all groups(Feldman et al., 1989; Pappas et al., 1993; Tyroler et al., 1993). Although it may be measured as level of education or income, SES is a complex phenomenon often based on indicators of relationships to work(occupational position or ranking), social class or status, and access topower. From a policy perspective as well as an etiological perspective, it isimportant to understand which of the components is critical \u2014for instance, if education is found to be important, the policies that may be implementedwould differ from the policies needed if income was found to be the mostinfluential factor. In fact, most research has not tested such competinghypotheses directly, so in the examples that follow, these have not beendisaggregated, although the indicators used in each study are explicitlyidentified. 3 \"Social capital is defined as the resources available to individuals and to society through social relationships, \" ranging from material to psychosocial resources (Kawachi et al., 2002).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html58 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH Several major studies have ascertained that education, income, and occupation, as indicators of SES, are associated with mortality and withmortality due to certain causes. The National Longitudinal Mortality Studyfound that mortality was strongly associated with all three measures of SES(Rogot et al., 1992; Sorlie et al., 1992, 1995) (see Box 2 -1). The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial followed 320,909 white and African-American men for 16 years (Davey Smith et al., 1996a, 1996b)and found that the median family income in one 's zip code of residence was predictive of death from a variety of causes. Heart disease, the leading causeof death in the United States, provides a strong example of the associationbetween SES and mortality. Research has documented the relationship be-tween SES and cardiovascular disease (NCHS, 1992; Kaplan and Keil,1993), and the British Whitehall longitudinal study of civil servants foundthat those in the lowest grades of employment were at the highest risk forheart disease (Marmot et al., 1991). A striking finding that emerges from analyses of occupation- and area- based income measures is the graded and continuous nature of the associa-tion between socioeconomic position and mortality, with differences per-sisting well into the middle socioeconomic ranges (Davey Smith et al.,1990; Blane et al., 1997; Macintyre et al., 1998). For example, in theWhitehall studies (Davey Smith et al., 1990; Marmot et al., 1991), the BOX 2-1 Linking SES to Health: Findings from the National Longitudinal Mortality Study Age-adjusted death rates for white men and women ages 25 to 64 with 0 to 4 total years of education that were 66 and 44 percent higher, respectively, than those for men and women with 5 or more years of college. Among African-American men and women ages 25 to 64, the corresponding increases in mortality were 73 and 78 percent, respectively. Age-adjusted death rates for white men and women with annual family incomes of less than $5,000 were 80 and 30 percent higher, respectively, than those fortheir counterparts in households with incomes of $50,000 or more. When income was used as an indicator of SES, men in African-American households earning less than $5,000 were twice as likely to die during follow-up than those in families earning $50,000 or more. Poor African-American women were 80 percent more likely to die than their wealthier counterparts. SOURCES: Rogot et al. (1992) and Sorlie et al. (1992, 1995).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlUNDERSTANDING POPULATION HEALTH AND ITS DETERMINANTS 59 individuals in each employment grade had worse health and a higher rate of mortality than those in the grade above. Although many of the studies that focused on occupation-, education-, or area-level SES showed a gradient that is virtually linear, studies thatfocus on income often show somewhat different results. For example, inwork by Backlund and colleagues (1996), the association between (increas-ing) income and (decreasing) mortality is clearly curvilinear, with the de-cline in the mortality rate with increasing income greatest among those ingroups earning less than $25,000 per year but with the decline with increas-ing income being much less among those earning between $25,000 and$60,000 per year. This curvilinear relationship suggests diminishing returnsof income as one approaches the highest income categories, although someassociation may persist. This curvilinear association between income andhealth is what lays the framework for findings that more egalitarian societ-ies (i.e., those with a less steep differential between the richest and thepoorest) have better average health, because a dollar at the bottom \"buys\" more health than a dollar at the top. Whether SES has a linear or curvilinearrelationship with health has enormous implications for understanding boththe etiologic associations and the policy implications of this research. Ineither case, however, it is important to note that a \"threshold \" model focused exclusively on the very poorest segments and ignoring others nearthe bottom and the working poor will not address the relatively poorpopulation health outcomes for the U.S. population as a whole. The majorreason for this is because there are groups in the moderate-risk categories ofworking poor and working class who contribute disproportionately largenumbers to death rates and poor health outcomes. SES is linked to health status through multiple pathways (such as distri- bution of health care, psychosocial condition, toxic physical environments,and health-related behaviors), but these relationships have not yet beenfully elucidated. It is also likely that some degree of reverse causationinfluences the strength of these associations. Studies in which educationrather than income or occupation is used as an indicator of SES are strongerin this regard since most people are not influenced by serious chronicdiseases related to cardiovascular disease, stroke, or cancer in ways thatinhibit their level of educational attainment in their adolescence and earlytwenties. Furthermore, although many studies have included a broad rangeof covariates in their multivariable analyses, it is of course possible thatunobserved attributes account for some observed disparities. There is ampleevidence that SES is strongly related to access to and the quality of preven-tive care, ambulatory care, and high-technology procedures (Kaplan andKeil, 1993); but health care appears to account for a small percentage of thevariation in health status among different SES groups. It has been arguedthat differential access to health care programs and services is not entirelyCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Furthermore,similar gradients persist in countries with universal coverage, such as theUnited Kingdom. Despite the past century 's great advances in sanitation, which have contributed to the sharp increase in life expectancy observed among allsocioeconomic groups, the socioeconomic gradient in health status persists.It has been proposed, and to some extent documented, that the gap inhealth status by SES may still be attributable to the effects of crowded andunsanitary housing, air and water pollution, environmental toxins, an inad-equate food supply, poor working conditions, and other such deficits thathave historically affected and that still disproportionately affect those in thelower socioeconomic strata (USPHS, 1979; Williams, 1990; Adler et al.,1994; Sargent et al., 1995; McLoyd, 1998). Studies that incorporate assess-ments of material deprivation and aspects of the physical environment willbe important to explicate these important potential pathways. Considerable evidence links low SES to adverse psychosocial condi- tions. People in lower socioeconomic positions are not only more materiallydisadvantaged, but also have higher levels of job and financial insecurity;experience more unemployment, work injuries, lack of control, and othersocial and environmental stressors; report fewer social supports; and morefrequently, have a cynically hostile or fatalistic outlook (Berkman and Karasek and al., 1994; Heaney et al., 1994;Bosma et al., 1997). There is most often, especially in the United States, a striking and consistent association between SES and risk-related health behaviors suchas cigarette smoking, physical inactivity, a less nutritious diet, and heavyalcohol consumption. This patterned behavioral response has led Link andPhelan (1995) to speak of situations that place people \"at risk of risks. \" Understanding why \"poor people behave poorly \" (Lynch et al., 1997) re- quires recognition that specific behaviors formerly attributed exclusively toindividual choice have been found to be influenced by the social context. Thesocial environment influences behavior by shaping norms: enforcing patternsof social control (which can be health promoting or health damaging); pro-viding or denying opportunities to engage in particular behaviors; and reduc-ing or producing stress, for which engaging in specific behaviors (such assmoking) might be an effective short-term coping strategy (Berkman andKawachi, 2000). Both physical and social environments place constraints onindividual choice. Over time, those with more economic and social resourceshave tended to adopt health-promoting behaviors and reduce risky behaviorsat a faster rate than those with fewer economic resources.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The most advantagedAmerican men and women experience levels of longevity that are the high-est in the world. However, less advantaged groups experience levels ofhealth comparable to those of average men and women in developing na-tions of Africa and Asia or to Americans about half a century ago (Berkmanand Lochner, 2002). Furthermore, these wide disparities coupled with thelarge numbers of people in these least-advantaged groups contribute to thelow overall health ranking of the United States among developed, industri-alized nations. A major opportunity for us to improve the health of the U.S.population rests on our capacity to either reduce the numbers of the mostdisadvantaged men, women, and children in the highest risk categories orto reduce their risks for poor health. Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health A substantial body of research documents the relationship between racial and ethnic disparities and differences in health status. Numerousstudies have shown that minority populations may experience burdens ofdisease and health risk at disproportionate rates because of complex andpoorly understood interactions among socioeconomic, psychosocial, (NCHS, 1998; Although Americans in general experienced substantial improve-ments in life expectancy at all ages throughout the twentieth century, sub-stantial gaps in life expectancy, morbidity, and functional status remainbetween white and minority populations. Life expectancy at birth for Afri-can Americans in 1990 was the same as that for whites in 1950. Even aftercontrolling for income, African-American men and women have lower lifeexpectancies than white men and women at every income level (for ex-ample, see Geronimus et al. [1996] and Anderson et al. [1997]). Whenindicators of SES are considered, these differences, which are often substan-tial across a diversity of health outcomes, are commonly reduced but re-main significant. Few studies have adequately controlled for SES in terms ofthe inclusion of economic indicators of wealth, homeownership, or othersources of income. Although these indicators should be included, they areunlikely to reduce disparities between African Americans and whites be-cause data suggest that there are even greater disparities in wealth (allassets) than in household income between these two groups (Ostrove et al.,1999). This phenomenon has led researchers to investigate the health ef-fects of discrimination itself. Aspects of discrimination might influencehealth through any number of mechanisms, including SES. However, con-ceptualizing discrimination (whether it applies to racial or ethnic minori-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Additionally, although many disparities aremeasured across broad racial and ethnic classifications, there is significanthealth status differentiation or \"hidden heterogeneity \" within, for instance, Asian-American and Pacific Islander populations (NCHS, 1998). The ac-knowledgment of disparities itself may generalize or aggregate groups thatare highly heterogeneous because of variations ranging from the date ofimmigration and level of acculturation to genetic, social, and cultural dif-ferences (Williams and Collins, 1995; Korenbrot and Moss, 2000). African Americans and other minority populations experience worse health from infancy to old age. Although the national infant mortality ratehas decreased over the years to about 7 per 1,000, the rate among African-American infants is nearly twice as high, 14 per 1,000, and that amongAmerican Indians is 9.3 per 1,000, whereas it is 5.8 per 1,000 amongwhites (NCHS, 2002). Rates of illness such as asthma are much higher among African Ameri- cans than among whites, as are levels of obesity, diabetes, and other cardio-vascular risk factors that are often established in adolescence and youngadulthood. For example, the prevalence of obesity among African Ameri-cans is 29.3 percent and that among Hispanics is 21.5 percent, whereas it is18.5 percent among whites (CDC, 2002). In 2000, the rate of diabetes-related mortality in non-Hispanic African Americans was 49.4 (per100,000), whereas it was 32.4 in Hispanics and 20.8 in non-Hispanicwhites (CDC, 2001b). Rates of death due to HIV/AIDS are 31.9 amongAfrican Americans and 3.7 among whites (CDC, 2000). Some of the racial and ethnic differences in health status may be associated with the fact that minority populations often encounter thehealth care system in very different ways in terms of both access andquality of care (Fiscella et al., 2000). For a variety of reasons \u2014both struc- tural (having to do with the health care system itself) and financial orcultural \u2014racial and ethnic minorities encounter barriers to health care that often result in less than optimal care and worse outcomes (Carlisle etal., 1997; Epstein and Ayanian, 2001; IOM, 2002). manystudies have concluded that African-American patients are significantlyless likely than white patients to receive certain revascularization proce-dures to treat coronary artery disease (Epstein and Ayanian, 2001). Barri-ers to care may include linguistic differences, a lack of insurance or diffi-culties with payment, immigration status, social issues such as trust andsome pervasive but subtle forms of racism and discrimination, and evenlogistical problems related to distance and transportation (Thomas, 2001;IOM, 2002). African-American and Hispanic children are more likely toCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlUNDERSTANDING POPULATION HEALTH AND ITS DETERMINANTS 63 be uninsured than white children and are less likely to have a usual source of health care (Weinick and Krauss, 2000). Recent research indicates thatdisparities in access persist even after controlling for socioeconomic cir-cumstances and health insurance coverage status (Roetzheim et al., 1999;Weinick and Krauss, 2000). Among other disparities in health care, Afri-can Americans have been shown to be less likely to receive certain diagnos-tic testing; adequate pain medication; early-stage diagnoses of cancer; di-alysis as initial treatment for end-stage renal disease, placement on a kidneytransplant waiting list, or a kidney transplant; and preventive rather thanacute asthma control measures (IOM, 2002). Hispanics are also likely toexperience similarly unequal access to health care services (IOM, 2002).With regard to treatment for HIV infection, once tested, HIV-infectedAfrican Americans are less likely to receive antiretroviral and related thera-pies (IOM, 2002). This is in the context of the fact that HIV infection isspreading more rapidly among African Americans and Hispanics thanamong whites. Although many studies indicate that certain racial differences in health persist among people of similar SES, it is also true that many minoritygroups are likely to be poorer and more disadvantaged than whites. Thisoverlap along both racial and economic lines creates a kind of \"double jeopardy, \" which is associated with substantially increasing risks for poor health. In terms of the association between poverty and minority status, in1998, for instance, 10 percent of non-Hispanic white children lived inpoverty, whereas 36.4 percent of African-American children and 33.6 per-cent of Hispanic children lived in poverty (CDC, 2000). When health out-comes are examined by level of education of the mother, family income,and ethnicity and race, enormous differences emerge between the least-advantaged African-American children and the most advantaged white chil-dren. For instance, among African-American children living below the pov-erty line, 22 percent have elevated blood lead levels, whereas 6 percent ofAfrican-American children in high-income families and slightly more than 2percent of white children in high-income families have elevated blood leadlevels. These patterns are persistent and are seen for other outcomes such aslow birth weight and hospitalizations for asthma (NCHS, 1998). Suchpronounced disparities have led to a presidential initiative targeted at ethnicand racial health disparities in six specific areas (White House, 1998; Officeof Minority Health, 2000). Also, the elimination of health disparities is agoal of Healthy People 2010 (DHHS, 2000). Social Connectedness and Health The association between social connectedness and health has received much attention in recent years. Concepts of social connectedness relate toCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html64 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH social integration at the broadest level, social networks, social support, and loneliness. Social connectedness may be conceptualized as a societal charac-teristic related to civic trust and social capital. This area-level experience isdiscussed in a later section. This section reviews the evidence that thestructure of social ties is related to health outcomes and discusses pathwaysthat may link such social experiences to health. People form ties to othersthe moment they are born. The survival of newborns depends upon theirattachment to and nurturance by others over an extended period of time(Baumeister and Leary, 1995). The need to belong does not stop in infancy,but rather, affiliation and nurturing social relationships are essential forphysical and psychological well-being throughout life. Over the past 20 years, 13 large prospective cohort studies in the United States, Scandinavia, and Japan have shown that people who are isolated ordisconnected from others are at increased risk of dying prematurely fromvarious causes, including heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, cancer, andrespiratory and gastrointestinal conditions (Berkman and Syme, 1979; Schoenbach et al., 1986;Orth-Gomer 1987; Cohen, et al., Pennix et al., 1997).Studies of large cohorts of people enrolled in health maintenance organiza-tions or occupational cohorts also report that social integration is critical tosurvival, although it may not be as critical an influence on the onset of disease(Vogt et al., 1992; Kawachi et al., 1996). Powerful epidemiological evidence supports the notion that social sup- port, especially intimate ties and the emotional support provided by them,is associated with increased survival and a better prognosis among peoplewith serious cardiovascular disease (Orth-Gomer et al., 1988; Berkman etal., 1992; Case et al., 1992) and strokes (Friedlandand McColl, 1987; Colantonio et al., 1992, 1993; Glass et al., 1993; Mor-ris et al., 1993). The lack of social support, expressed in terms of conflict orloss of intimate ties, is also associated with health outcomes and risk factorssuch as neuroendocrine changes in women (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 1997),high blood pressure (Ewart et al., 1991), elevated plasma catecholamineconcentrations (Malarkey et al., 1994), and autonomic activation (Levensonet al., 1993). Caregivers of relatives with progressive dementia are charac-terized by impaired wound healing (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 1995, 1998).Social conflicts have been shown to increase susceptibility to infection(Cohen et al., 1998). Several studies have recently shown that older men and women with high levels of social engagement and networks have slower rates of cogni-tive decline (Bassuk et al., 1999; Fratiglioni et al., 2000) and better survivalindependent of physical activity (Glass et al., 2000). The pathways bywhich social networks might influence health are multiple and includeCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

For instance, evidence suggests that, in gen-eral, social network size or connectedness is inversely related to risk-relatedbehaviors. People who are socially isolated are more likely to engage insuch behaviors as tobacco and alcohol consumption, to be physically inac-tive, and to be overweight (Berkman and Glass, 2000). Behavioral path-ways such as these do not appear to account for a large part of the associa-tion between social isolation and poor health, but they are important toconsider. It is important to note that networks themselves have generallybeen shown to exert powerful influences on the behavior of both adoles-cents and adults, so that networks can either promote health or increaserisk depending on the norms of the networks themselves. Experimental work with animals and humans indicates that social iso- lation can have a direct effect on physiologic function and subsequentdiseases. Animals that are isolated in adulthood, that experience maternalseparation, or that are not nurtured in infancy develop more atherosclero-sis; have poor, inefficient, or exaggerated neuroendocrine responses; andmay 1996). Among humans and primates,those who lack affiliation and strong social networks have been shown tobe more likely to develop colds, have stronger stress responses in terms ofneuroendocrine reactions and higher levels of cardiovascular reactivity, andhave altered immune responses (Glaser et al., 1992, 1999; Kirschbaum etal., 1995; Cohen et al., 1997; Sapolsky et al., 1997; Roy et al., 1998;Cacioppo et al., 2000). There is limited research on whether access tomaterial goods and resources is a mechanism through which social net-works might influence health, and this is an important area for investiga-tion. We do know, however, that networks have the capacity to provideinformational and instrumental support effectively. Although much of theresearch in this area examines the effects of close relationships and socialsupport, there is also evidence that weak social ties may also have indirectpositive effects on health and well-being. For instance, a classic investiga-tion of how people find jobs suggests that weak ties to others may be morehelpful in enabling people to find jobs, providing access to one of the mostcritical life opportunities. Whereas one 's close friends and relatives (who are likely to belong to the same social circles) may often provide redundantinformation, weak social ties (e.g., a friend of a friend) may allow individu-als to tap into new sets of information (Granovetter, 1995). Instrumentaland informational support, two critical components of the support para-digm, relate to help with practical matters such as grocery shopping; ridesto the doctor; and information about health care, behavior, and risk.

However, a recent clinical trial,Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease, aimed at improving socialsupport to reduce mortality and reinfarction among subjects after myocar-dial infarction, found no effect (NIH, 2001). Developing both clinical andpopulation-based experimental studies is the next step in this work. A large body of evidence accumulated over the last two decades consis- tently points to the importance of social connectedness, and incorporationof this evidence would involve the inclusion of nurturing community andsocial networks. As we think of broad social determinants of health thatcould be influenced to improve health, social connections may be one ex-ample that has the support of a number of sectors. Because social relation-ships influence health through such a myriad of pathways, broad healthimprovements may be facilitated by considering and enacting policies thatsupport social connections. Work-Related Conditions and Health Two decades of research show that the workplace not only generates adverse health effects due to economic circumstances such as downsizingand unemployment or to work conditions such as job demands, control,latitude, and threatened job loss (Karasek and Theorell, 1990), but alsogenerates protective health effects such as social ties that may help counter-act the physical and mental adverse effects of work stressors (Buunk andVerhoeven, 1991). The \"demand -control \" model was developed to de- scribe the psychosocial work environment (Karasek and Theorell, 1990),and other empirical studies have tested the predictive validity of the modelwith respect to physical health, for instance, by examining the effects ofreward relative to effort (Sigerist, 1996). It has been hypothesized that job strain (the combination of a psycho- logically demanding workplace and a low level of job control) leads toadverse health outcomes, and findings show that job control is an impor-tant component of health-promoting work environments (Johnson et al.,1996; North et al., 1996; Bosma et al., 1997, 1998; Theorell et al., 1998).Schnall and colleagues (1994) found that lower levels of job control (theopportunity to use and develop skills and to exert authority over workplacedecisions) were predictive of adverse cardiovascular disease outcomes in 17of 25 studies, whereas high psychological demands of work had similarlynegative effects in only 8 of 23 studies. The links between unemployment and health have been investigated byCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Although longitudinal studies of European populations have dem-onstrated a significant relationship between unemployment and higher stan-dardized mortality ratios (SMRs), even after adjusting for age and socialstatus (Moser et al., 1984, on the U.S. National Longitudinal Mortality Study (Sorlieand Rogot, 1990) have shown no significant association between age, edu-cation, and income-adjusted SMRs and unemployment for either men orwomen. However, other U.S. epidemiological findings associate unemploy-ment or risk of job loss with health conditions such as depression andengagement in negative health behaviors such as substance abuse, poordiet, and inactivity (Dooley et al., 1996). Analysis of panel data from theU.S. Epidemiologic Catchment Area study suggested that the 1-year inci-dence of clinically significant alcohol abuse was greater among those whohad been laid off than among those who had not (Catalano et al., 1993).Examination of cases of job loss due to factory closures is important be-cause worker characteristics in such cases have no effect on the loss of jobs.Morris and Cook (1991) reviewed longitudinal studies of factory closuresand found that the job loss experience exerts a negative effect on physicalhealth. The impact of threatened job loss has received increased attention re- cently. European studies found negative effects on health because of threat-ened job loss or organizational change, although there were no significantdifferential trends in weight, blood pressure, or blood glucose over time. The Whitehall II cohort of British civil servants (Ferrie et al., 1995, 1998) found that white-collar workers under threat of major organiza-tional change (elimination or transfer to the private sector) may experienceadverse changes in self-rated health, long-standing illness, sleep patterns,and number of physical symptoms and may experience minor psychiatricmorbidity. Longitudinal data on male Swedish shipyard workers threat-ened with job loss and on stably employed controls (Mattiasson et al.,1990) showed that serum cholesterol concentrations increased significantlyamong the former group. In a study of Finnish government workers(Vahtera et al., 1997), downsizing was associated with increased medicallycertified sick leave. Among American automobile workers (Heaney et al.,1994), extended periods of job insecurity were associated with increasedphysical symptoms. However, workers who remain in an organization aftera downsizing do not experience a decline in well-being, despite an increasein work demands (Parker et al., 1997). Contrary to work conditions relatedto involuntary job loss, retirement does not appear to have negative healthconsequences (Moen, 1996; Kasl and Jones, 2000).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Among the most important findings to emerge from public health research overrecent years is the extent to which characteristics of areas exert independenteffects on health. This ecological 4 approach has been rediscovered and is now embedded in a multilevel framework. The major idea is that character-istics of places \u2014neighborhoods, schools, work sites, and even nations \u2014 carry with them health risks for the individuals who live in those environ-ments. The health risk conferred by these places is above and beyond therisk that individuals carry with them. Thus, we might view characteristicsof physical environments (e.g., parks and buildings) as well as social envi-ronments (e.g., levels of inequality and civic trust) as truly properties ofplaces, not individuals. In this section, the committee reviews evidencerelated to two aspects of places \u2014economic inequality and social capital \u2014 that are assessed at an ecological level to examine their effects on health.These findings are relatively new and undoubtedly will be refined withfurther research. Economic inequality may exert an effect on health inaddition to the effect of individual income on health. Such an effect may beparticularly robust for people in the United States who are at the lower endsof the distribution. The United States is among the richest countries in the world, yet it is also one of the most (and increasingly) unequal in terms of the distributionof its wealth as measured by a wide and growing gap between the best-offand the worst-off quintiles (Weinberg, 1996; Jencks, 2002) (see Box 2 -2). At a national level, the hypothesis linking income inequalities and healthwould predict that two countries with the same average income but differ-ent income distributions would experience different patterns of mortality,with the country with the more even distribution having a longer life ex-pectancy overall. Cross-national studies initially supported an associationbetween income equality and population longevity, but more recent re-search, which includes newer and more accurate data for more countries,suggests that the area-level effects of inequality across nations may not holdover time (Lynch et al., 2001; Gravelle et al., 2002; Rodgers, 2002). Recentstudies have shown the cross-national correlation between economic in-equality and mortality to be very weak or virtually nonexistent (Kunst etal., 1998). Furthermore, in several countries (Canada, for example), in-equalities at the level of provinces or neighborhoods within cities often havebeen found to be not significant in terms of health status. In the United 4 \"Ecological \" refers to the ecology or the combined characteristics (e.g., the social and economic characteristics) of places.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlUNDERSTANDING POPULATION HEALTH AND ITS DETERMINANTS 69 States, however, data are more consistent in supporting the area-level effect of inequality net of individual effect. For example, Kaplan and colleagues(1996) and Kennedy and colleagues (1996) independently found that thedegree of household income inequality in the 50 states was associated withthe state-level variation in total mortality, as well as with the state-levelvariations in infant mortality and rates of death from coronary heart dis-ease, cancer, and homicide. The findings persisted after controlling forurban -rural proportion and for health behavior variables such as cigarette smoking rates. Lynch and colleagues (1998) observed a relationship between income inequality and mortality at the level of U.S. metropolitan areas. Althoughincome inequality is strongly correlated with poverty ( R = 0.73), the ad- verse effect of income inequality on health outcomes does not appear to beexplained entirely by the fact that places that exhibit income inequalityhave greater concentrations of poor people, who in turn have a higher riskof mortality (compositional effects). There is also evidence of a contextualeffect of income inequality directly on individual health (Wilkinson, 1992;Kennedy et al., 1998; Soobader and LeClere, 1999). Kennedy and col-leagues (1998) reported that people residing in states with the greatestincome inequality were 1.25 times more likely to report being in fair orpoor health than were those living in the most egalitarian states. The effectof income inequality was statistically significant and independent of abso-lute income levels. These findings pose the challenge of explaining why the effects of in- equality are more significant and conclusive in the United States than inother developed nations. Some (Kawachi and Kennedy, 1997) have arguedthat inequality is associated with a lack of investment in education, devel-BOX 2 -2 Income Inequality in the United States In 1968, the wealthiest 20 percent of U.S. households earned an average of $73,754, whereas the poorest 20 percent of households earned $7,202 (At-kinson et al., 1995). In 1994, the inflation-adjusted average income of the top 20 percent of house- holds had jumped to $105,945, whereas the average income of the bottom 20percent of households had grown to only $7,762 (Brown et al., 1997). The \"best-off \" 1 percent of the American population owns 40 to 50 percent of the nation 's wealth (Hacker, 1997; Wolff, 2000). In 2001, the poverty rate was 11.7 percent; that is, 32.9 million people lived below the poverty thresholds (Proctor and Dalaker, 2002).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html70 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH opment, and social services and is also related to weak civic and social bonds \u2014or a lack of trust \u2014between people (Wilkinson, 1996; Kawachi et al., 1997; Kawachi and Berkman, 2000). Some countries buffer the effectsof inequality with stronger social service programs. Investigators have ar-gued that U.S. analyses have not adequately considered other state-level orcountry-level social and demographic factors (e.g., racial composition) thatmay not be \"downstream \" in the causal chain linking inequality to health (Deaton and Lubotsky, 2001). These questions remain challenges to a newfield. However, it is important to note that these studies are all examiningthe contextual or area-level effects of inequality, net of individual or \"com- positional \" effects. No one has disputed the strong and consistent effects of SES on individual health. New research on area-level efforts related toneighborhoods, work sites, and states and even across countries poses con-siderable methodological challenges (Deaton, 2002). Nonetheless, such re-search holds great potential to help us understand the ways in which boththe social and the physical (built and natural) environments may affecthealth and behavior. Social participation and integration can also be conceived of as both individual and societal characteristics (Kawachi and Kennedy, 1997). Someinvestigators have started to conceptualize these dimensions at an ecologi-cal or group level. At the group level, a socially cohesive society, or one inwhich most citizens are socially integrated, is one that is endowed withstocks of \"social capital, \" which consists partly of moral resources such as trust between citizens and norms of reciprocity. This has led investigatorsto examine the area-level effects of these domains. Particular interest hasbeen focused on the relationship between social capital and health. At agroup level, more socially integrated societies seem to have lower rates ofcrime, suicide, and mortality from all causes and a better overall quality oflife (Wilkinson, 1996; Kawachi and Kennedy, 1997; Kawachi and Berkman,2000). Kawachi and colleagues (1997) analyzed social capital indicators across the United States in relation to state-level death rates. The per capitadensity of membership in voluntary groups was inversely correlated withage-adjusted mortality from all causes. Density of civic association, groupmembership, and levels of interpersonal trust (i.e., percentage of citizensendorsing the expectation that altruistic behaviors will be returned in kindat some future time) were also associated with lower mortality. Kawachiand colleagues (1999) also carried out a multilevel study of the relation-ship between the above indicators of state-level social capital and indi-vidual self-rated health. A strength of this study was the availability ofinformation on individual medical and behavioral confounding variables,including health insurance coverage, cigarette smoking, and being over-weight, and on sociodemographic characteristics, such as household in-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Even after adjustment for these variables, people residing in states with low levels of social capitalwere more likely to report fair or poor health. The odds ratio for fair orpoor health in association with living in areas with the lowest levels ofinterpersonal trust as opposed to the highest levels of interpersonal trustwas 1.41. There are several plausible mechanisms by which social cohesion might influence health through contextual effects. At the neighborhood level,social capital might influence health behaviors by promoting the morerapid diffusion of health information. Sampson and colleagues (1997) pro-vide evidence that \"collective efficacy, \" or the extent to which neighbors are willing to exert social control over deviant behavior, plays an importantrole in preventing crime and delinquency. Neighborhood social capital alsocould affect health by increasing access to local services and amenities(Sampson et al., 1997). Finally, neighborhood social capital could influencehealth through direct psychosocial pathways by providing social supportand acting as the source of self-esteem and mutual respect. Although there has been a great deal of interest in these area-level studies of social capital, there has also been a fair amount of skepticismregarding their validity. Several social scientists (Portes and Landolt, 1996;Sandefur and Laumann, 1998; Durlauf, 1999) have voiced concerns aboutthe ambiguity of the concept, the potential for social capital to lead toundesirable outcomes related to the exclusion of certain groups, and insuf-ficient attention to the determinants of social capital itself or the causalpatterning between it and other social conditions. Future studies will bestrengthened with the addition of items tapping the conceptual richness ofthe domain of social capital and the capacity to distinguish it from otherclosely related constructs of social networks and SES. POPULATION-LEVEL PREVENTIVE INTERVENTIONS The evidence presented and discussed in this chapter aims to demon- strate that taking into account the environmental and social determinantsof health is essential to creating effective population-level interventions forhealth improvement. Health risk is related to a complex of social, eco-nomic, and political factors that both surpass and powerfully interact with\"downstream \" elements such as individual behaviors, biological traits, and access to health care services. There have been few empirical tests of popu-lation-based approaches to health promotion that focused on risk-relatedsocial conditions, but in an effort to understand how such approachesmight work, several examples are presented to illustrate the effectivenessand efficiency (e.g., cost) of population-based interventions to prevent dis-ease and promote health.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html72 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH Preventive interventions at the population level may be classified as uni- versal, selective, and indicated, borrowing the classification developed byGordon (IOM, 1994b). A universal measure is one that would be desirable for everyone in an eligible population. It would focus on shifting the entirepopulation distribution rather than on targeting only relatively high-riskindividuals, as illustrated earlier in this chapter. It would likely involve anagreed-on public policy requiring broad-based public understanding and po-litical support. A selective preventive measure is one that is desirable only when an individual is a member of a subgroup of the population whose riskof becoming ill is above average. These are the more traditional population-oriented public health education interventions targeted toward the high-risksegments of the population. Finally, an indicated preventive measure is one that is applicable to persons who, on examination, manifest a risk factor,condition, or abnormality that identifies them individually as being at highrisk for the future development of a disease. This type of intervention, usuallyprovided in the context of clinical practice, deals only with individuals diag-nosed with a disease, not with the nameless statistical subset of a populationas in selective preventive measures. For example, a universal preventive mea-sure for heart disease could include the provision of general advice to con-sume a diet low in fat accompanied by a regulatory policy requiring foodlabeling. A selective intervention could include a program focusing on dietand behavioral changes for overweight individuals who do not exercise regu-larly, and an indicated preventive measure might include antihypertensivemedication for those diagnosed as hypertensive. Although many studies have looked at the effectiveness of preventive measures, few have studied universal, population-level strategies. In somecases, however, such as tobacco use prevention and automobile-relatedinjury prevention population-based strategies (e.g., laws) have been usedsuccessfully, largely because of recognition of the broad determinants ofhealth. Results of these interventions indicate that, at least in some cases, apopulation-level strategy or, to use Gordon 's classification, a universal mea- sure may be more optimal and cost-effective than interventions targetedfurther downstream (i.e., at the individual level). Acting on the most up-stream level of determinants of health typically means the level of nationalpolicy. This may help shift national norms and values that lead to thepassage, adoption, and ultimately, success of the respective legislation, as inthe case of seat belt legislation, which has steadily and gradually normal-ized this behavior across America, or tobacco policy, which has curbed theuse of tobacco (e.g., through changes in the social landscape of outdooradvertising and sanctions on smoking in the workplace and public placessuch as restaurants). Alternately, upstream policy interventions may alsorefer to modifying the broader, social determinants of health such as in-come (e.g., through the provision of earned income tax credits and mini-mum wage increases), education, and social connectedness.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlUNDERSTANDING POPULATION HEALTH AND ITS DETERMINANTS 73 Policy making at the national, state, and local levels has the potential to positively shape population health by addressing specific elements ofthe determinants of health, such as inadequate housing, unavailability offamily-friendly social and work policies, lack of public transportation,lack of safe public spaces, and so forth. The health consequences of con-taminated water and leaded gasoline have been well elaborated. It is nowtime to determine their social equivalents \u2014elements of the social environ- ment that influence health status \u2014and take action to shape them in sup- port of population health. Such action may focus not only on education,decent housing, and a living wage but also on the political choices thatmove the broad (social and other) determinants of health in a positivedirection. For example, certain health care disparities (e.g., disparities inaccess and quality) are created in part by political choices and by allowingpublic and private insurance programs to limit coverage for preventivehealth care and for conditions related to mental health, substance abuse,and oral health. Seat Belt Laws Federal legislation has been an important strategy in reducing motor vehicle injuries (IOM, 1998). Between 1966 and 1970, highway safety actsauthorized the federal government to set safety standards for new vehiclesand equipment (e.g., standard safety belts for all automobile occupants)and to develop a coordinated national highway safety program, establishedin 1970 as the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration. A number of early studies found seat belts to be cost-effective (Warner, 1982). A more recent report outlines the benefits of safety belts based onmedical and financial information from the Crash Outcome Data Evalua-tion System. A 1996 report to Congress revealed that safety belts are highlyeffective in reducing morbidity and mortality and in decreasing the severityof injuries (e.g., the inpatient charge for unbelted accident victims was 55percent greater than the charge for those who wore seat belts) (NHTSA,1996). Other evidence suggests smaller, although still significant, differ-ences between injuries experienced by belted and unbelted accident victims.National averages indicate that for each occupant involved in a crash,medical costs average $2,930 for restrained riders and $5,630 for unre-strained riders (in 1995 dollars) (Miller et al., 1998). Although there are ethnic differences in seat belt use, rates of seat belt use are higher in states that implement and enforce restraint laws (Daviset al., 2001; Schiff and Becker, 2002). Seat belt laws have had a signifi-cant impact on modifying behavior and thus decreasing risk and improv-ing health outcomes across the population. Such strong effects for anysingle piece of legislation illustrate that this orientation can be effective.

The benefit -cost ratio per quality- adjusted life year showed that all three interventions offered net costsavings (Miller, 2001). The case of seat belt legislation demonstrates thatsuch upstream or population-level measures aiming to prevent disease anddisability may be effective in transforming social norms and ultimatelychanging behavior. The Case of Tobacco Tobacco prevention and cessation efforts have offered many lessons about the links between behavior and disease and how to intervene effec-tively to improve population health. CDC described the \"antismoking cam- paign \" dating from the first Surgeon General 's report as one of the major public health successes of the second half of the twentieth century (Warner,2000). Effective antismoking campaigns are generally comprehensive, mul-tidimensional interventions involving several aspects of prevention and con-trol. One of the most important lessons learned from the tobacco experi-ence is that the social context or social environment serves as a potent forcein shaping smoking behavior. Therefore, measures such as creating educa-tional and information-filled environments (from counteradvertising totruthful labeling and Surgeon General 's warnings) and enacting regulations to restrict smoking in buildings or public spaces and to control tobaccomarketing and sales (to minors) have been effective in changing smokingbehavior. School-based antismoking interventions constitute an effective preven- tion strategy, although one that is resource intensive (and thus not suffi-ciently accessible), given the state-of-the-art programs needed to assuresuccess (DHHS, 1994; Warner, 2000). The Growing Up Tobacco Free report (IOM, 1994a) has detailed three categories of tobacco preventionstrategies: information dissemination approaches, effective education ap-proaches, and social influence approaches. According to that report, theformer two strategies fail to address the relationship between the acquisi-tion of knowledge and behavior and the addictive nature of tobacco, nor dothey address the social context in which smoking occurs, which often in-volves peer pressure and norms about use. The third strategy (the socialinfluence approach) was developed to address the deficiencies of earlierstrategies, and in a meta-analysis of 143 adolescent drug use preventionCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Multiple levels of influence and multiple determi-nants affect the uptake of smoking, from individual characteristics andbehaviors to population-level advertising and availability. Also, as notedearlier in the context of generic population health improvement, upstreamapproaches, including action at the community or population level, may bemore cost-effective than downstream approaches directed at specific indi-viduals (Corbett, 2001). Such measures, it seems, make use of the charac-teristics of social networks and relationships that may be used as elementsto further protect health. Although recognizing the importance of ap-proaches that go beyond individuals and their behavior, use of a socialinfluences strategy may not work well if it is used alone, as in the case of theHutchinson Smoking Prevention Project, a long-term randomized trial thatused a school-based social influences approach and concluded that it lackedlong-term effectiveness to deter smoking (Peterson et al., 2000). Accordingto Warner (2000), success is more likely when a broad array ofmultisectoral, multilevel, upstream interventions is used. Such upstream measures include taxation of cigarettes, which appears to affect tobacco consumption among youth and adults and both the initia-tion and the cessation of tobacco-smoking (Chaloupka et al., 2002). It alsoappears to have a more powerful impact among lower-income groups thanhigher-income groups, an important concept because most of the educa-tional interventions are believed to be more effective among more highlyeducated groups (Evans and Farelly, 1998; Warner, 2000). Overall, onaverage it appears that an approximately 10 percent increase in the price ofcigarettes will produce a 4 percent reduction in demand. Policies based ontaxation have the potential to have a significant impact on smoking ratesnationwide (Warner, 2000), although the effectiveness of taxation on teen-agers becomes somewhat attenuated in adulthood, underscoring the needfor interventions on several fronts (Glied, 2002). An added benefit of taxincreases is the production of revenue while the level of consumption de-clines. Cigarette taxation is an excellent example of a cost-effective preven-tive strategy aimed at the entire population. It is serving to broaden the faceof policy interventions in public health, leading to consideration of taxationin relation to alcohol consumption, unhealthy diets, and even gun control.It is feasible that such economic disincentives could affect a broad range ofother social and behavioral conditions as well. In a recent effort to develop a model for evaluating the outcomes of youth-targeted tobacco prevention and control programs, the Social Sci-ence Research Center at Mississippi State University developed a SocialClimate Survey. Baseline data were obtained in 1999, and national datawere added to the model in 2000 for comparison purposes. The SocialCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Data from the surveys have indicated that implementationof a comprehensive, multidimensional approach to tobacco prevention andcessation will affect the social climate in which decisions regarding tobaccouse are made (McMillen et al., 2001). Some of the most striking examples of the environmental embeddedness and social implications of health risk come from the study of alcohol andtobacco product advertising. For example, a study of billboards in Chicagowas compared to census data and demonstrated that the density of adver-tising for alcohol was five times higher in poor and minority urban wardsthan in other geographic areas and that the density of advertising for to-bacco products was three times higher (Hackbarth et al., 1995). An obser-vational study of tobacco billboard advertising in St. Louis used geographicinformation systems and found that advertisements were concentrated inlow-income and minority neighborhoods, as well as in close proximity topublic school property (Luke et al., 2000).

THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM IN ACTION: A SCENARIO In this section, the committee uses the specific scenario of a risk to population health \u2014namely, obesity \u2014to present and discuss the contribu- tions that communities, the health care delivery system, employers andbusiness, the media, academia, and the governmental public health infra-structure can make to improve health. Food and eating are integral to thelife of individuals and communities. Families, friends, and neighbors gatheraround meals; and both the process of eating and the food itself are heavilyimbued with cultural, social, and even emotional meaning. This helps ex-plain why eating and nutrition perfectly exemplify the influence of multipledeterminants on health. The development of obesity itself is influenced bymultiple determinants of health, from the genetic to the social and environ-mental, and the public health partners must consider these many dimen-sions in formulating their responses. Obesity: Magnitude and Future Trends The problems of overweight and obesity in America have reached epi- demic proportions and threaten the health and quality of life of millions ofadults and children. According to CDC 's 1999 National Health and Nutri-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The prevalence ofobesity among adults has grown by nearly 20 percent over the past 30years, and the number of children who are overweight has tripled in thesame period (see Figure 2 -3) (CDC, 2001a). Obesity is a growing concern because it poses a higher risk and results in a higher incidence of health conditions such as diabetes, cardiovasculardisease, stroke hypertension, osteoarthritis, and certain cancers than otherrisk factors (NIH, 1998; Allison et al., and Bogardus, 2001; Tuomilehto et al., 2001). The human and economic costs are impossible to ignore. Every year an estimated 300,000 U.S. adults die of causes that may be attributed toobesity; in addition, others suffer from chronic disease and an impairedquality of life (Allison et al., 1999; Mokdad et al., 2000). According toanother estimate, as many as 309,000 to 582,000 deaths in 1990 were19911995 2000 <10% 10%-14% 15%-19% 20% No Data FIGURE 2 -3 Obesity trends among U.S. adults: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveil- lance System (BRFSS), 1991, 1995, 2000.NOTE: Obesity is BMI 30, or -30 lbs overweight for 5 4 woman.

Should the number of overweight and obese Americans con-tinue to grow at its current rate, obesity will surpass tobacco as the mostpreventable cause of death and illness in the United States. Additionally, theestimated direct and indirect costs associated with obesity are $100 billionannually (Wolf and Colditz, 1998), and this figure does not take intoconsideration the cost of treating the uninsured or the personal impact ofobesity on quality of life. The fact that the prevalence and incidence of type II diabetes mellitus (see Figure 2 -4) have increased exemplifies the association between weight and health. The rise in the rate of obesity during the past decade has beenparalleled by a 25 percent increase in the rate of type II diabetes (Harris etal., 1998). The rapid and large rate of increase in obesity among children isespecially alarming, given that childhood obesity is clearly associated withobesity in adulthood and subsequent health problems. For instance, untilrecently, type I diabetes was the most prevalent type of diabetes amongchildren. However, new studies have shown that the rate of type II diabetesis increasing dramatically and that 85 percent of children with type II19901995 1999 4% 4-6% 6% n/a FIGURE 2 -4 Diabetes and Gestational Diabetes trends among adults in the United States: BRFSS 1990, 1995, and 1999.

Approximately 63 percent of the total direct costs associated with obesity are related to type IIdiabetes (Wolf and Colditz, 1998). Although the prevalence and growth of obesity affect all segments of the population, there are notable trends among certain segments. Men aremore likely to be overweight, whereas women are more likely to be obese.Obesity also increases with age until the mid-60s; this may be partly be-cause Americans over the age of 65 are more likely to be malnourished. Theprevalence of obesity among African Americans and Hispanics, especiallywomen, is significantly higher than that among other populations. Peoplewith lower education and income levels also have increased rates of obesity,as do people living in the southeastern region of the United States (CDC,2000). The causes of obesity are both complex and multifaceted. Although genetic factors do play a role in determining whether a person has a propen-sity for obesity, nutritional, behavioral, and environmental factors are moresignificant (Hill and Peters, 1998). Americans are consuming more calories,eating higher-calorie foods, and exercising less than ever before. Work ismore likely to be sedentary than in the past; and more time is spent watch-ing television, playing video games, or using computers. High-calorie foodchoices are widely available and easily affordable as more Americans turnto fast food and prepared meals on a daily basis. Furthermore, food por-tions have become \"supersized, \" surpassing the Department of Agriculture and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) recommendeddietary guidelines for how much food Americans should consume each day. At the same time, the number of physical education programs in schools isdeclining, and people in some communities lack access to affordable andnutritional food options and safe areas in which to exercise (Hill and Peters,1998; CDC, 1999a; Crespo et al., 2001; Dietz, 2001; French et al., 2001). The association between obesity and socioeconomic factors illustrates the value of a population perspective and the need to consider the multipledeterminants of health in addressing population health improvement. Engaging Partners Changing patterns in infectious diseases typically attract attention and significant mobilization of funding and action. Chronic disease has oftenbeen less of a priority for public health and health care organizations, butthe evidence of escalating obesity in the United States is alarming andshould motivate widespread action to contain and reverse the effects of thissilent epidemic. Such concerted action cannot be undertaken successfully bygovernmental public health agencies alone; it requires the resources andefforts of other partners within the public health system. Taking action toCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html80 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH address the problem of obesity also requires that all entities in the public health system engage in partnerships; demonstrate accountability to theirpatients, communities, clients, employers, and each other; make programand policy decisions based on the evidence (e.g., community assessmentsand effectiveness data); and communicate effectively with other partnersand the public. For example, communities and community-based organiza-tions can assess the extent of overweight and obesity in the community andengage in a range of activities, from traditional, modestly successful meth-ods that involve the provision of education and information to more inno-vative and powerful efforts to change the community conditions that makesedentary living and unhealthy eating \"the path of least resistance. \" They can encourage the adoption of active lifestyles by working with communitydevelopment and planning agencies to make parks and playing fields safeand accessible. As discussed in Chapter 4, communities can also makechanges in their physical surroundings, by engaging in a variety of activitiesto improve neighborhood safety and livability, and by increasing the amountof green space and the recreational options available to children. Schoolscan become sites for community recreation centers that are affordable andeasy to access. Communities could also facilitate the formation of commu-nity walk groups that meet on a regular basis to exercise together and shareknowledge and success stories. The recently launched Hearts N 'Parks pro- gram sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and theNational Recreation and Park Association is getting communities interestedand mobilized to become physically active by planning a variety of commu-nity and educational activities (NIH, 2002). In the area of nutrition, school cafeterias can also modify their offerings to support better food choices by students. Through partnerships withschools, communities can work to change children 's eating and physical activity habits by providing support and information to help teachers andschool staff modify curricula and change cafeteria menus, and by not per-mitting vending machines with sugar- and fat-laden products in the schoolsetting. For example, the Los Angeles Unified School District discontinuedsoda vending on all school premises in the district, thus removing an ele-ment that has been linked to childhood obesity (Wood, 2002). Communi-ties could also develop relationships with farmers to make fresh fruits andvegetables more readily available and affordable through weekly markets.Neighborhood restaurants and grocery stores could offer and advertisehealthier foods. In partnership with local media, health officials, large andsmall businesses, and others, community groups can spearhead publicawareness campaigns and emphasize the importance of physical activityand the opportunities available, as well as the need to make healthy foodchoices, within a context of enhanced access, affordability, and culturalappropriateness.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlUNDERSTANDING POPULATION HEALTH AND ITS DETERMINANTS 81 The health care delivery system can provide training and resources to all health care providers and professionals to recognize and monitor indi-viduals who are overweight or obese and to inform and educate patientsabout the risks and the changes that they can make and the benefits thatthey will receive. Health care plans should base administrative policy deci-sions on the evidence (e.g., the association between eating, exercise, andchronic disease and the three times greater likelihood that patients who arecounseled about weight loss by their health care providers will actually tryto lose weight). The health care sector should also work to adopt theNational Institutes of Health 's (NIH 's) 1998 Clinical Guidelines on the Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity inAdults and partner with researchers to establish treatment protocols (e.g., pharmacotherapy and surgery) that are safe, effective, and tailored to indi-vidual needs and circumstances. Health care systems and providers shouldalso communicate and work collaboratively with health departments andcommunity-based and national associations and advocacy groups focusedon educating the public about the link between obesity and chronic disease. Businesses and employers can play a major role in carrying out some essential public health services. The contributions of employers may rangefrom providing health insurance plans that offer comprehensive preventiveservices to supporting research about and implementation of workplacepromotion of weight management (e.g., by providing healthy cafeteria andvending machine alternatives and the space, equipment, and time for physi-cal activity). Food industry businesses may also provide point-of-sale nutri-tional information and healthier menu options. The news and entertainment media can play a unique part in address- ing the problem of obesity. The media can serve primarily as a source ofinformation about the associations between physical activity and nutrition,weight, and chronic disease. Through reporting and entertainment, themedia creates a forum for discussing Americans ' increasing girth, its impli- cations for overall health, the social and cultural correlates, and relatedissues that may increase awareness. Local media may collaborate with localhealth officials to communicate locally relevant information and to high-light opportunities for community-based physical activity. By taking part intackling this major population health concern, the media can better fulfillits accountability to the public to provide accurate and timely information. The academic setting can make many contributions to addressing obe- sity and its impact on overall population health, especially to the evidencebase. For example, research has demonstrated that educational approachesaimed at improving individual knowledge and action about food choicesand exercise have been largely ineffective at preventing weight gain (Nestleand Jacobson, 2000; Jeffery, 2001). Academic research is necessary to en-hance current monitoring and surveillance tools to more accurately trackCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Also needed is the development of moreprecise and consistent assessment tools for measuring obesity and over-weight among children. It is also important for academia to continue tosupport, evaluate, and implement projects related to environmental condi-tions and policies for their impact on decreasing obesity and increasinghealthy eating habits and physical activity. Academia can also disseminatedata more broadly to interested parties on initiatives, programs, and poli-cies that are effective and document and analyze how obesity affects mentalhealth, development, and socialization; continue to research the relation-ship between obesity and various medical conditions; and develop preven-tion and treatment protocols to address them. Academic researchers cancontinue to evaluate treatment strategies made available by advances intechnology, pharmacokinetics, and genetic research. The role of the governmental public health infrastructure in responding to the obesity epidemic is multifaceted. Such efforts may include supportingthe activities of other partners, funding NIH and academic research onobesity, helping to develop the Dietary Guide for Americans (a collabora-tion between DHHS and the Department of Agriculture), and spearheadinga variety of initiatives such as food labeling. The role of the federal govern-ment in addressing obesity is essential, as it sets the pace for the nationand underscores this as a critical issue in assuring population health. InJune 2002, in the wake of the 2001 Surgeon General 's report on obesity, President George W. Bush launched a new initiative, HealthierUS, that en-courages Americans to pursue physical activity, healthy eating, and otherhealthy choices and to get preventive screenings (White House, 2002). In July2002, CDC launched a multicultural Youth Media Campaign (entitled\"VERB: It 's what you do. \") targeting youth across the nation (DHHS, 2002). The campaign encourages children between ages 9 and 13 to choose a \"verb\" (e.g., swim, run, or bowl) that fits their personality and interests and to startapplying that verb in their daily lives. The campaign aims to engage childrenin a type of physical activity that they enjoy and, ultimately, to help themreap the related benefits of enhanced self-esteem, social connectedness, confi-dence, and discipline. At the local level of governmental public health agen-cies, health departments may administer or collaborate with the Departmentof Agriculture 's Women, Infants and Children (WIC) food supplementation program that provides nutritious foods and education to mothers and chil-dren up to age 5. They may also collaborate with local school programs andengage in many other community-based efforts that target overweight andobesity through a wide range of activities.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

This chapter has outlined away to understand how social, environmental, and biological conditionsshape population health. Population-based interventions, such as tobaccocontrol policies, show that it is possible to implement cost-effective strate-gies that benefit society as a whole and improve the health of many seg-ments of the population. Population health improvements will have tofocus attention on both overall improvement in the nation 's health and reduction of the disparities in health, as recommended by Healthy People 2010 . To achieve this goal, the nation will have to develop innovative strategies for interventions for a broad set of health determinants. Many ofthe determinants of health are part of the broad economic and social con-text and, thus, beyond the direct control of administrators in public- andprivate-sector health care organizations. Action on these strategies at thenational level will require an alignment of public policy in the agriculture,commerce, education, and treasury sectors of government, among others,to promote health. This includes providing resources to support the popu-lation-based research necessary to further our understanding of the socialetiology of disease and disability. Efforts to curb tobacco use have a 50-yearhistory from the appearance of the first surgeon general 's report. There is now a high level of consensus and political will to act. Effective publichealth systems must be vehicles to accelerate such efforts to save thousandsof lives that will otherwise be lost. The special role of the governmentalpublic health infrastructure is to advocate for and educate others about theevidence to support such policy actions and to assure that the public healthsystem \u2014the diverse array of individuals and organizations that must act together for health at the community level \u2014is both committed to and equipped for implementation of a coordinated set of strategies to attain thehighest levels of health for the nation. The next chapters of this reportexplore the potential role of each component of the public health system inachieving this goal. Assurance is one of the three core public health functions put forth by the 1988 IOM report The Future of Public Health . The special role of the gov- ernmental public health infrastructure in this mission will be that of steward,facilitator, and supporter rather than actor in every situation, because assur-ing a healthy nation cannot be accomplished through a single plan of actionor through the efforts of a single governmental agency or sector of theeconomy. Instead, it will require a coordinated set of strategies that must beimplemented by all Americans \u2014as individuals, families and community mem-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

With each sector of society assum- ing a portion of the responsibility for improving the health of the nation, itbecomes increasingly possible to achieve the nation 's true potential for a population with excellent health and the fewest possible disparities. The chapters that follow discuss several partners within a redefined public health system that has as its backbone the governmental public health infrastructure but that includes the resources, perspectives, and ac-tions of other stakeholders who are partners in the public health system.Each of these partners can increase the relevance of its contributions topopulation health by considering the multiple determinants of health, espe-cially those that contribute to unequal opportunities for good health.

Nothing can be more importantto a state than its public health; the state's paramount concern should be the health of its people. Franklin Delano Roosevelt (quoted in Gostin, 2000) An effective public health system that can assure the nation's health requires the collaborative efforts of a complex network of people and orga-nizations in the public and private sectors, as well as an alignment of policyand practice of governmental public health agencies at the national, state,and local levels. In the United States, governments at all levels (federal,state, and local) have a specific responsibility to strive to create the condi-tions in which people can be as healthy as possible. For governments to playtheir role within the public health system, policy makers must provide thepolitical and financial support needed for strong and effective governmen-tal public health agencies. Weaknesses in the nation's governmental public health infrastructure were clearly demonstrated in the fall of 2001, when the once-hypotheticalthreat of bioterrorism became all too real with the discovery that manypeople had been exposed to anthrax from letters sent through the mail.Communication among federal, state, and local health officials and withpolitical leaders, public safety personnel, and the public was often cumber-some, uncoordinated, incomplete, and sometimes inaccurate. Laboratorieswere overwhelmed with testing of samples, both real and false. Many ofthese systemic weaknesses were well known to public health professionals,but resources to address them had been insufficient. A strong and effectivegovernmental public health infrastructure is essential not only to respond tocrises such as these but also to address ongoing challenges such as prevent-ing or managing chronic illnesses, controlling infectious diseases, and moni-toring the safety of food and water.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE 97 The fragmentation of the governmental public health infrastructure is in part a direct result of the way in which governmental roles and responsi-bilities at the federal, state, and local levels have evolved over U.S. history.This history also explains why the nation lacks a comprehensive nationalhealth policy that could be used to align health-sector investment, govern-mental public health agency structure and function, and incentives for theprivate sector to work more effectively as part of a broader public healthsystem. In this chapter, the committee reviews the organization of govern-mental public health agencies in the United States. The chapter then exam-ines some of the most critical shortcomings in the public health infrastruc-ture at the federal, state, and local levels: the preparation of the publichealth workforce, inadequate information systems and public health labo-ratories, and organizational impediments to effective management of publichealth activities. The committee recommends steps that must be taken torespond to these challenges so that governmental public health agencies canmeet their obligations within the public health system to protect and im-prove the population 's health. The committee believes that the federal and state governments share a responsibility for assuring the public 's health. From a historical and consti- tutional perspective, public health is largely a local and state function. Therole of the states and localities is a primary and important one. The federalgovernment, however, has the resources, expertise, and the obligation toassess the health of the nation and to make recommendations for its im-provement. Ensuring a sound public health infrastructure is an urgent mat-ter, and the committee urges the federal government to engage in planningfor national and regional funding to accomplish this. PRIOR ASSESSMENTS OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE In 1988, The Future of Public Health (IOM, 1988) reported that the American public health system, particularly its governmental components,was in disarray. In that report, the responsible committee sought to clarifythe nature and scope of public health activities and to focus specifically onthe roles and responsibilities of governmental agencies. Aiming to provide aset of directions for public health that could attract the support of thebroader society, the committee produced findings and made recommenda-tions dealing with three basic issues: 1. The mission of public health 2. The government 's role in fulfilling this mission and 3. The responsibilities unique to each level of governmentCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html98 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH The mission of public health was specified as \"fulfilling society 's inter- est in assuring conditions in which people can be healthy \" (IOM, 1988: 7). The government 's role in fulfilling this mission was described in terms of three core functions of public health practice: assessment of health statusand health needs, policy development, and assurance that necessary servicesare provided. States were considered to have primary public responsibilityfor health, but it was considered essential that residents of every communityhave access to public health protections through a local component of thepublic health system. The public health obligations of the federal govern-ment included informing the nation about public health policy issues, aid-ing states and localities in carrying out their public health functions in acoordinated manner, and setting national health goals and standards. Thereport also contained recommendations for a review of the statutory basisfor public health, the establishment of the governmental public health infra-structure as the clear organizational hub for public health activities, betterlinkages to other government agencies with health-related responsibilities,and strategies to strengthen the capacities of public health agencies to per-form the core functions. A complete listing of the recommendations fromthat report can be found in Appendix C. Responding to Disarray The Future of Public Health provided the public health community with a common language and a focus for reform, and progress has been made. InWashington, Illinois, and Michigan, for example, revisions of the state publichealth codes resulted in the inclusion of mandatory provisions for fundingand the distribution of services to all communities \"no matter how small or remote, \" as recommended by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) (1988). In 1994, the Public Health Functions Working Group, a committee convenedby the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) with representa-tives from all major public health constituencies, agreed on a list of theessential services of public health. This list of services translates the three corefunctions into a more concrete set of activities, called the 10 Essential PublicHealth Services (see Box 3 -1). These essential services provide the foundation for the nation 's public health strategy, including the Healthy People 2010 objectives concerning the public health infrastructure (DHHS, 2000) (seeAppendix D) and the development of National Public Health Performance Standards (CDC, 1998) for state and local public health systems. At least four subsequent National Academies reports have made a strong case for sustained federal action both domestically and internation-ally to strengthen the public health infrastructure (IOM, 1992, 1997a,1997b; NRC, 2002). The federal government has yet to take the initiativeto develop a comprehensive, long-term plan to build and sustain the financ-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) established (in 1989) the PublicHealth Practice Program Office and strengthened university-based Centersfor Prevention Research (initiated in 1983). CDC also developed PublicHealth Leadership Institutes (initiated in 1992) at the national and regionallevels and the National Public Health Training Network (initiated in 1993).Both programs respond to recommendations to improve the overall leader-ship competencies of public health practitioners. In 1993, CDC began dis-cussions of a modern and uniform approach to public health surveillance,and it has moved forward with the development of a National ElectronicDisease Surveillance Network. More recently, CDC has worked with statesto establish the Health Alert Network (initiated in 1999) to improve infor-BOX 3-1 The 10 Essential Public Health Services Assessment 1.

Theseprograms provided important services in the aftermath of September 11,2001. Many units within CDC have contributed to strengthening the public health infrastructure. The National Center for Chronic Disease Preventionand Health Promotion, for example, has led the effort to develop statewidepopulation-based cancer registries, a tracking system for cardiovasculardisease, and a program for the early detection of breast and cervical cancer(CDC, 2002). The National Center for Environmental Health also contrib-uted to the improvement of public health monitoring and assessment func-tions when it developed a biomonitoring program to measure people 's exposures to 27 different chemicals by analyzing human blood and urinesamples. This program offers the first national assessment of people 's expo- sure to 24 chemicals for which exposures were not previously assessed and3 for which exposures were previously assessed. In 2002, the center begandeveloping a nationwide environmental public health tracking networkin response to a Pew Environmental Health Commission report entitledAmerica 's Environmental Health Gap: Why the Country Needs A National Health Tracking Network (Pew Environmental Health Commission, 2000; www.cdc.gov/nceh/tracking/background.htm). Among CDC initiatives arethe development of immunization registries and a guide to communitypreventive services (www.cdc.gov). Limited Progress Despite this progress, the committee found that in many important ways, the public health system that was in disarray in 1988 remains indisarray today. Many of the recommendations from The Future of Public Health have not been put into action. There has been no fundamental reform of the statutory framework for public health in most of the nation.Funding for the public health infrastructure has recently increased to sup-port the infrastructure that relates to bioterrorism and emergency prepared-ness but may still be insufficient. Furthermore, governmental and nongov-ernmental support (both political and financial) and advocacy for thereport 's recommendations have been limited. Progress is mixed in strength- ening public health agencies ' capacities to address environmental health problems, in building linkages with the mental health field, and in meetingthe health care needs of the medically indigent. In addition, new informa-tion and technological challenges face the system today. In a recent reviewof the nation 's public health infrastructure for the U.S. Senate Appropria- tions Committee, CDC (2001d) pointed to the need for further efforts toCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Finding continued disarray in the public health system is especially disturbing because the nation faces increasingly diverse threats and chal-lenges. The early detection of and the response to these threats will dependon capacity and expertise within the public health system at every level. Thegaps in the system warrant urgent remediation. Many of these basic re-forms also require actions from agencies that are outside the direct controlof governmental public health agencies but whose policies and programscan have important health consequences, such as the Environmental Protec-tion Agency (EPA) (environment) and the Departments of Agriculture (nu-trition and food safety), Labor (working conditions), and Treasury (eco-nomic development). This support has not been forthcoming from electedor appointed government officials (including those in control of budgets),and stakeholders in the broader public health system \u2014who should have been partners in the vision of creating a healthier nation \u2014have yet to be effectively mobilized in this effort. In the next section, the committee provides an overview of the special role of governmental public health agencies (at the federal, tribal, state, andlocal levels). The section addresses the legal framework for governmentalresponsibility and its authorities for protecting the health of the people aswell as the organization of the governmental public health infrastructure. THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENTS IN PUBLIC HEALTH: AN OVERVIEW AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK Governments at every level \u2014federal, tribal, state, and local \u2014play im- portant roles in protecting, preserving, and promoting the public 's health and safety (Gostin, 2000, 2002). In the United States, the government 's responsibility for the health of its citizens stems, in part, from the nature ofdemocracy itself. Health officials are either directly elected or appointed bydemocratically elected officials. To the extent, therefore, that citizens placea high priority on health, these elected officials are held accountable toensure that the government is able to monitor the population 's health and intervene when necessary through laws, policies, regulations, and expendi-ture of the resources necessary for the health and safety of the public. The U.S. Constitution provides for a national government, with power divided among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches, each withdistinct authority. The states have adopted similar schemes of governance.In health matters, the legislative branch creates health policy and allocatesthe resources to implement it. In the executive branch, health departmentsand other agencies must act within the scope of legislative authority byCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html102 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH implementing legislation and establishing health regulations to enforce health policy. The judiciary 's task is to interpret laws and resolve legal disputes. Increasingly, the courts have exerted substantial control over pub-lic health policy by determining the boundaries of government power(Gostin, 2000). The separation of powers provides a system of checks andbalances to ensure that no single branch of government can act withoutsome degree of oversight and control by another. Modern public health agencies wield considerable power to make rules to control private behavior, interpret statutes and regulations, and adjudi-cate disputes about whether an individual or a company has conformed tohealth and safety standards. In the area of health and safety (which is highlycomplex and technical), public health agencies are expected to have theexpertise and long-range perspective necessary to assemble the facts abouthealth risks and to devise solutions. Role of State and Local Governments in Assuring Population Health States and their local subdivisions retain the primary responsibility for health under the U.S. Constitution. 1 To fulfill this responsibility, state and local public health authorities engage in a variety of activities, includingmonitoring the burden of injury and disease in the population throughsurveillance systems; identifying individuals and groups that have condi-tions of public health importance with testing, reporting, and partner noti-fication; providing a broad array of prevention services such as counselingand education; and helping assure access to high-quality health care ser-vices for poor and vulnerable populations. State and local governments alsoengage in a broad array of regulatory activities. They seek to ensure thatbusinesses conduct themselves in ways that are safe and sanitary (throughthe institution of measures such as inspections, licenses, and nuisance abate-ments) and that individuals do not engage in unduly risky behavior or posea danger to others (through the provision of services such as vaccinations,directly observed therapy, and isolation), and they oversee the quality ofhealth care provided in the public and private sectors. Role of Tribal Governments in Assuring Population Health Although their legal status varies, tribal governments have a unique sovereignty and right to self-determination that is often based on treatieswith the federal government. Under these treaties, the federal government 1 The 10th Amendment enunciates the plenary power retained by the states: \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. \"Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE 103 has an obligation to provide tribes with certain services, including health- related services. In addition, American Indians and Alaska Natives areeligible as individual citizens to participate in state health programs. How-ever, in some instances, tribal -state relations are strained, and there are often misunderstandings about the relative responsibilities of states andtribes for the financing of health care and population-based public healthservices. Until the mid-1970s, the federal government directly providedhealth care services to American Indians living on reservations and to AlaskaNatives living in villages through the Indian Health Service (IHS), an agencywithin DHHS. In 1975, the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assis-tance Act (P.L. 93 -638) established two other options for obtaining these services: (1) tribal governments can contract with IHS to provide the ser-vices or (2) administrative control, operation, and funding for the servicescan be transferred to a tribal government (IHS, 2001c). In the mid-1970s,legislation also authorized funding health services for American Indiansliving in urban areas. 2 The operation of IHS programs depends on annual discretionary appropriations, which are generally considered inadequate(Noren et al., 1998; IHS, 2001a). Some tribes are able to supplement IHSfunding, but many cannot. Many tribes have health directors and operateextensive public health programs that include environmental safety andcommunity health education, as well as direct curative and preventive ser-vices. Role of the Federal Government in Assuring Population Health The federal government acts in six main areas related to population health: (1) policy making, (2) financing, (3) public health protection, (4)collecting and disseminating information about U.S. health and health caredelivery systems, (5) capacity building for population health, and (6) directmanagement of services (Boufford and Lee, 2001). For most of its history,the U.S. Supreme Court has granted the federal government broad powersunder the Constitution to protect the public 's health and safety. Under the power to \"regulate Commerce . . . among several states \" and other consti- tutional powers, the federal government acts in areas such as environmentalprotection, occupational health and safety, and food and drug purity(Gostin, 2000). The federal government may set conditions on the expendi-ture of federal funds (e.g., require adoption of a minimum age of 21 forlegal consumption of alcoholic beverages to receive Federal-Aid Highway 2 According to 1990 Census Bureau data, about 56 percent of the American Indian and Alaska Native population lived in urban areas (IHS, 2001b). Census data for 2000 show a similar pattern, with 57 percent of individuals who identify themselves solely as Native Ameri- can or Alaska Native living in metropolitan areas (Forquera, 2001).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The judicial branch also can shape federal health policy in many ways. It can interpret public health statutes and determine whether agencies areacting within the scope of their legislative authority. The courts can alsodecide whether public health statutes and regulations are constitutionallypermissible. The Supreme Court has made many decisions of fundamentalimportance to the public 's health. The court has upheld the government 's power to protect the public 's health (e.g., require vaccinations), set condi- tions on the receipt of public funds (e.g., set a minimum drinking age), andaffirmed a woman 's right to reproductive privacy (e.g., a right to contracep- tion and abortion). Gostin (2000) notes that although the courts generallyhave been permissive on matters of public health, stricter scrutiny has comewhen there is any appearance of discrimination against a suspect class orinvasion of a fundamental right, such as bodily integrity. Public Health Law: The Need for State Reforms Because primary responsibility for protection of the public 's health rests with the states, their laws and regulations concerning public healthmatters are critical in determining the appropriateness and effectiveness ofthe governmental public health infrastructure. At present, however, the lawrelating to public health is scattered across countless statutes and regula-tions at the state and local levels and is highly fragmented among the statesand territories. Furthermore, public health law is beset by problems ofantiquity, inconsistency, redundancy, and ambiguity that make it ineffec-tive, or even counterproductive, in advancing the population 's health. The most striking characteristic of state public health law, and the one that underlies many of its defects, is its overall antiquity. Much of publichealth law contains elements that are 40 to 100 years old, and old publichealth statutes are often outmoded in ways that directly reduce their effec-tiveness and their conformity with modern legal norms in matters such asprotection of individual rights. 3 These laws often do not reflect contempo- rary scientific understandings of health risks or the prevention and treat- 3 For example, a South Dakota statute passed in the late 1800s and last amended in 1977 makes it a misdemeanor for a person infected with a \"contagious disease \" to \"intentionally [expose] himself . . . in any public place or thoroughfare \" (S.D. Codified Laws \u00a7 34-22-5). Similarly, an 1895 New Jersey statute forbids common carriers to \"accept for transportationCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE 105 ment of health problems. For example, laws aimed at preventing casual transmission of airborne diseases such as influenza and measles have littlerelevance for control of the sexually transmitted and blood-borne pathogensthat are major concerns of health authorities today (Gostin et al., 1999).When many of these statutes were written, the science of public health, infields such as epidemiology and biostatistics, and of behavior and behavioralinterventions, such as client-centered counseling, was in its infancy. Related to the problem of antiquity is the problem of multiple layers of law. The law in most states consists of successive layers of statutes andamendments, built up over more than 100 years in some cases, in responseto changing perceptions of health threats. This is particularly troublesomein the area of infectious diseases, which forms a substantial part of statehealth codes. Colorado 's disease control statute, for example, has separate sections for venereal diseases, tuberculosis, and HIV. All three sectionsauthorize compulsory control measures, but they vary significantly in theprocedures required and the public health philosophy expressed. Whereasthe venereal disease statute simply empowers compulsory examinationwhenever health officials deem it necessary, the HIV section sets out a list ofincreasingly intrusive options (requiring use of the least restrictive) andplaces the burden of proof on the health department to show a danger topublic health (Gostin et al., 1999). Because health codes in each state and territory have evolved indepen- dently, they show profound variations in their structures, substance, andprocedures for detecting, controlling, and preventing injury and disease. Infact, statutes and regulations among American jurisdictions vary so signifi-cantly in definitions, methods, age, and scope that they defy orderly catego-rization. There is, however, good reason for greater uniformity among thestates in matters of public health. Health threats are rarely confined tosingle jurisdictions, instead posing risks across regions or the entire nation. State laws do not have to be identical. There is often a justification for the differences in approaches among the states if there are divergent needsor circumstances. There is also a case for states ' acting as laboratories to determine the best approach. Nevertheless, a certain amount of consistency within this state any person affected with a communicable disease or any article of clothing, bedding, or other property so infected \" without a license from the local board of health (N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 26:4 -11 9). This might have made some sense in a time when diseases such as influenza, diphtheria, and measles were significant sources of serious illness and death, but it serves little purpose today. Although it may be impolite for people with the flu to walk around in public, it is not a major health threat. Furthermore, efforts to isolate people who donot pose a significant health risk would often violate modern disability discrimination law (it was held that the threat of disease did not justify excessively stringent quarantine of a blind plaintiff 's guide dog) (see Crowder v. Kitagawa , 81 F.3d 1480, 1481, 9th \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html106 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH is vital in public health. Infectious diseases and other health threats do not confine themselves to state boundaries but pose regional or even nationalchallenges. States must be able to engage in surveillance and respond tohealth threats in a predictable and consistent fashion, using similar legalstructures. Consistent public health statutes would help facilitate surveil-lance and data sharing, communication, and coordinated responses to healththreats among the states. Consider the coordination that would be neces-sary if a biological attack were to occur in the tristate area of New York,New Jersey, and Connecticut. Laws that complicate or hinder data commu-nication among states and responsible agencies would impede a thoroughinvestigation and response to such a public health emergency. To remedy the problems of antiquity, inconsistency, redundancy, and ambiguity, the Robert Wood Johnson and W. K. Kellogg Foundations ' Turning Point initiative launched a Public Health Statute ModernizationCollaborative in 2000 \"to transform and strengthen the legal framework for the public health system through a collaborative process to develop amodel public health law \" (Gostin, 2002). The model public health law focuses on the organization, delivery, and funding of essential public healthservices, as well as the mission and powers of public health agencies. It isscheduled for completion by October 2003, and current drafts are availableon the Turning Point website, at http://www.turningpointprogram.org. The process of law reform took on new urgency after the events of September 11, 2001, and the subsequent intentional dispersal of anthraxthrough the postal system. In response, the Center for Law and the Public 's Health at Georgetown University and Johns Hopkins University drafted theModel State Emergency Health Powers Act (MSEHPA) at the request ofCDC (www.publichealthlaw.net). DHHS recommends that each state re-view its legislative and regulatory needs and requirements for public healthpreparedness. MSEHPA offers a guide or checklist for governors and legis-latures to review their current laws. As of September 2002, three-quartersof the states had introduced a version of MSEHPA, and 19 states hadadopted all or part of the act (Gostin et al., 2002). The model act, underreview by federal and state officials, defines the purpose of the legislation asgiving the governor and other state and local authorities the powers andability to prevent, detect, manage, and contain emergency health threatswithout unduly interfering with civil rights and liberties. The legislationwould address matters including reporting requirements, information shar-ing, access to contaminated facilities, medical examination and testing, andprocedures for isolation and quarantine (Center for Law and the Public 's Health, 2001). CDC is facilitating the law reform process through its internal Public Health Law Collaborative. Efforts are in place to improve scientific under-standing of the interaction between law and public health and to strengthenCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE 107 the legal foundation for public health practice. Through the Public Health Law Collaborative, CDC is joined in its work in public health law by agrowing number of partners. These include public health practice associa-tions, academic institutions and researchers, and public policy organiza-tions (www.phppo.cdc.gov/PhLawNet). The committee finds that the problems of antiquity, inconsistency, re- dundancy, and ambiguity render many public health laws ineffective oreven counterproductive in improving population health. A set of standardsand procedures would add needed clarity and coherence to legal regulation.Therefore, the committee recommends that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, in consultation with states, appoint a na-tional commission to develop a framework and recommendations for statepublic health law reform. In particular, the national commission wouldreview all existing public health law as well as the Turning Point 4 Model State Public Health Act and the Model State Emergency Health PowersAct 5; provide guidance and technical assistance to help states reform their laws to meet modern scientific and legal standards; and help foster greaterconsistency within and among states, especially in their approach to differ-ent health threats. It is essential that any reform of public health legislation address the powers needed to deal effectively with bioterrorism and otherpublic health emergencies that pose significant threats across state bound-aries. Each state could adapt the commission 's recommendations to its unique legal structures and particular needs for public health preparedness.Public health is traditionally a state function, so the commission wouldprovide guidance to the states rather than impose standards. The following section provides a description of the federal, state, and local governmental agencies that are responsible for protecting the health ofthe public. Later in the chapter, the committee examines certain aspects ofthe state and local public health infrastructures that are of special concern. The State and Local Governmental Public Health Infrastructure Although the states carry the primary constitutional responsibility and authority for public health activities in the United States, public health 4 Turning Point, a program funded by the Robert Wood Johnson and W. K. Kellogg Foundations, works to strengthen the public health infrastructure at the state and local levels across the United States and spearheads the Turning Point National Collaborative on Public Health Statute Modernization. 5 The Model State Emergency Health Powers Act (MSEHPA) provides states with the powers needed \"to detect and contain bioterrorism or a naturally occurring disease outbreak. Legislative bills based on MSEHPA have been introduced in 34 states \" (Gostin et al., 2002).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html108 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH administration first began in cities in the late eighteenth century (Rosen, 1993). The burgeoning social problems of industrial cities convinced legis-latures to form more elaborate and professional public health administra-tions within municipal governments (Duffy, 1990). City boards of healthwere established to obtain effective agency supervision and control of healththreats facing the population. Only after the Civil War did states formboards of health. County and rural health departments emerged in the earlytwentieth century (Ferrell and Mead, 1936). Today, there are more than3,000 local public health agencies, 3,000 local boards of health, and 60state, territorial, and tribal health departments (CDC, 2001b). Structure and Governance of State and Local Public Health Agencies The organization and authority granted to state and local public health agencies vary substantially across the country. Every state has an agencywith responsibility for public health activities. That agency may be anindependent department or a component of a department with broaderresponsibilities, such as human services programs. In 31 states, the statehealth officer is also the head of the larger health and human servicesagency (Turnock, 2000). Physicians and nurses often lead state public healthagencies. At the local level, however, general managers with business train-ing rather than formal training in public health or medicine may lead publichealth agencies. States differ in terms of the relationship between the state agency and the agencies serving localities within the state. In some states (e.g., Arkan-sas, Florida, Georgia, and Missouri), the state public health infrastructure iscentralized, meaning that the state agency has direct control and authorityfor supervision of local public health agencies. In other states (e.g., Califor-nia, Illinois, and Ohio), local public health agencies developed indepen-dently from the state agency, in that they are run by counties or townships(rather than the state) and report directly to local boards of health or healthcommissioners or are governed by cooperative agreements. Still other states(e.g., Iowa and North Dakota) have no local public health agencies and thestate public health agency is preeminent (Fraser, 1998). In a recent report on the local public health agency infrastructure, the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO)(2001d) identified five types of local public health agencies (see Figure 3 -1). The most common arrangement is a local public health agency (LPHA) serving a single county, ranging from small rural counties (e.g., IssaquenaCounty, Mississippi, with a population less than 1,000) to large metropoli-tan counties (e.g., Los Angeles County, with a population approaching 10million). LPHAs may also serve single cities of various sizes (e.g., KansasCity, Missouri, and New York City). A combined city -county local publicCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Town- ship local public health agencies are common in states with strong \"home- rule\" political systems6 (e.g., Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Jer- sey). City or township health agencies may operate within counties that arealso served by county health agencies. Multicounty local public health agencies often span large geographic areas in the western United States. For example, the Northeast ColoradoHealth District serves six counties, an area roughly equivalent in size to thatof the state of Vermont. In these local public health agencies, health direc-tors may be accountable to multiple county boards of health or to a com-bined board of health whose membership represents the counties or otherunits covered by the local public health agency. The multicounty localpublic health agency category also includes state health department re-gional offices that act as local public health agencies, an arrangement foundin several states (e.g., Alabama, New Mexico, Tennessee, and Vermont). The governance of state and local public health agencies generally fitsCounty CityCity-countyTownshipMulticounty FIGURE 3 -1 Types of local public health agencies (LPHAs) across the United States. 6 Home-rule statutes (in constitutions or by statute) give localities (e.g., cities or counties) powers of self-government. In such cases, localities can exercise police powers independently from the state.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

In a cabinet model, the head of the agency is appointed by and answers to the governor, mayor, or other executive authority. Undera board-of-health model, the state or local health director reports to anappointed board representing constituencies served by the department. Inmany cases, however, a board of health functions in a strictly advisorycapacity, with no oversight authority. Under an \"umbrella \" model, the public health agency is part of a larger agency, and the health director eitherheads the agency or reports to its head. There are considerable variationswithin these three models. Even with this great variability in governance at both the state and local levels, there are no data to suggest what an \"ideal\" state and local agency governance structure might be. Thus, it would be important for state agen-cies to examine their present governance structures and evaluate mecha-nisms to make these structures more effective. Doing so should serve tobuild and strengthen relationships with local public health agencies, coordi-nate efforts for the delivery of the essential public health services and crisisresponse services, integrate essential health information, and respond to thechanging health needs of the population. Scope of Agency Responsibilities and Activities At both the state and local levels, there are differences among public health agencies in terms of the scope of their authority, responsibilities, andactivities. At the state level, activities such as immunization, infectiousdisease control and reporting, health education, and health statistics arecommon to most public health agencies. States are also responsible forlicensing and regulating the institutional and individual providers that de-liver health care services. However, states differ in whether the public healthagency has responsibility for programs such as mental health and substanceabuse, environmental health, and Medicaid. These organizational differ-ences make it more complicated to frame and pursue a coherent nationalagenda concerning changes and improvements in the governmental publichealth infrastructure. A recent NACCHO (2001e) survey of local public health agency infra- structures has helped document the variation in services provided at thelocal level. Among county health departments, for example, 98 percentprovided childhood immunizations (directly or through contract services),76 percent were responsible for restaurant inspections and licensing, and 31percent provided dental services. City and township local public healthagencies were often less likely to offer services that other types of localpublic health agencies provided. The most common services provided bylocal public health agencies include those most associated with traditionalpublic health practice: adult and childhood immunizations, communicableCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE 111 disease control, community assessment, community outreach and educa- tion, environmental health services, epidemiology and surveillance, foodsafety, health education, restaurant inspections, and tuberculosis testing.Services provided by a smaller percentage of local public health agenciesincluded treatment for chronic disease, behavioral and mental health ser-vices, programs for the homeless, substance abuse services, and veterinarypublic health (NACCHO, 2001d). One widespread change in the scope of local public health agency activities is a reduction in the direct delivery of health care services, espe-cially to Medicaid participants. This is consistent with a national effort tohave governmental public health agencies return their attention to themore population-based public health services that had been weakened bythe pressing need to provide safety-net services to uninsured individuals.Although some have been unable to do so, many state and local publichealth agencies now have contracts with managed care organizations andother private providers to serve those populations. A substantial transferof service delivery from health departments to private providers has alsooccurred for childhood immunizations under federal and state programsfor the purchase and distribution of vaccines (IOM, 2000a). Some re-searchers have found the partnership between managed care and localpublic health agencies to be positively associated with the overall scopeand perceived effectiveness of local public health activities in terms oftheir ability to meet population-based community needs (Mays et al.,2001). (See Chapter 5 for additional discussion of the role of health careservices providers in the public health system.) However, some local pub-lic health agencies have found it difficult to compensate for the loss ofrevenue that had previously come from the delivery of health care servicesthat have now been transferred to managed care organizations (Wall,1998; Keane et al., 2001). THE FEDERAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE In contrast to state and local public health agencies, the federal govern- ment has a limited role in the direct delivery of essential public healthservices. Nevertheless, it plays a crucial role in protecting and improvingthe health of the population by providing leadership in setting health goals,policies, and standards, especially through its regulatory powers. It alsocontributes operational and financial resources: to assure financing of healthcare for vulnerable populations through Medicare, Medicaid, Communityand Migrant Health Centers, and IHS programs; to finance research andhigher education; and to support development of the scientific and techno-logical tools needed to improve the effectiveness of the public health infra-structure at all levels.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html112 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH Organization of the Federal Public Health Infrastructure At the federal level, the lead entity responsible for public health activi- ties is DHHS. Several key agencies in DHHS comprise the U.S. PublicHealth Service (PHS): the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality,CDC, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), theFood and Drug Administration (FDA), the Health Resources and ServicesAdministration (HRSA), IHS, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), andthe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration(SAMHSA). In addition, various White House agencies such as the Officeof Science and Technology Policy and the Office of National Drug ControlPolicy, 14 cabinet-level departments and agencies (e.g., Department of Ag-riculture, Department of Transportation, EPA, Department of VeteransAffairs [VA], and Department of Defense [DOD]), and more than 10 publiccorporations and commissions and subcabinet agencies are responsible forcertain health programs. The U.S. Congress oversees the activities of federal agencies through committees that review the authorization of programs and the appropria-tion of funds. Multiple committees in both the House of Representativesand the Senate have jurisdiction over DHHS programs and health-relatedactivities in other departments. These multiple authorities and congres-sional jurisdictions are an important reason for the \"disarray \" noted in previous IOM reports. Scope of DHHS Responsibilities and Activities Although activities and responsibilities related to public health are spread throughout the federal government, the committee focused its attention onDHHS and its agencies as the principal federal component of the nation 's governmental public health infrastructure and as the principal point of con-tact for other federal agencies with health or health-related programs and forstate and local public health agencies. Reviewed briefly here are DHHS ac-tivities related to the previously noted functions of policy making, financingof public health activities, public health protection, collection and dissemina-tion of information about U.S. health and health care delivery systems, capac-ity building for population health, and direct management of services. Someof these activities are considered in more detail later in this chapter, in con-junction with the discussion of specific concerns regarding weaknesses in thenation 's governmental public health infrastructure. Policy Making Policy making is a critical function for DHHS and involves the initia- tion, shaping, and ultimately, implementation of congressional and presi-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE 113 dential decisions. It involves the creation and use of an evidence base, informed by social values, so that public decision makers can shape legisla-tion, regulations, and programs. The annual budget cycle is routinely thetime when lawmakers present new legislation and renew legislation forexisting programs and when DHHS defends proposed program budgets toCongress. Policy making also occurs through program initiatives that donot require legislative action. One of the leading examples in public healthis the Healthy People initiative, which establishes national goals and objec-tives for health promotion and disease prevention. The Healthy Peopleinitiative is led by the DHHS Office of Disease Prevention and HealthPromotion and now involves all DHHS operating divisions, other federaldepartments, and partnerships with state and local public health officials,as well as more than 350 national membership organizations, nongovern-mental organizations, and corporate sponsors. Although the effort is volun-tary, the activity and regular widespread public consultation involved in theinitiative have perhaps proved to be the department 's most effective nonlegislative policy vehicle for promoting action on population health atthe national, state, and local levels (Boufford and Lee, 2001). Financing of Public Health Activities Through a variety of mechanisms \u2014grants, contracts, and reimburse- ments through publicly funded health insurance programs \u2014DHHS is an important financial contributor to the activities of state and local govern-mental public health agencies, primarily by financing personal health careservices through mandatory spending for the entitlement programs of Med-icaid. The fiscal year (FY) 2002 budget for Medicaid amounted to $142billion (OMB, 2001b); in sharp contrast, the DHHS discretionary budgetfor PHS agencies in FY 2002 was about $41 billion, of which $23.2 billionwas designated for NIH. Very little of this discretionary money goes di-rectly to states for governmental public health agency infrastructure. Public Health Protection Public health protection is perhaps the most classic public health func- tion of the federal government. In this regard, the federal government usesits surveillance capacity to assess health risks and its standard-setting andregulatory powers to protect the public from health risks: unfair treatment;low-quality services; and unsafe foods, medicines, biologics such as bloodand medical devices, as well as environmental and occupational healthhazards. In addition to certain regulatory responsibilities, DHHS also de-velops and maintains a research base that produces the scientific evidenceneeded to support the regulations in health-related areas that other federalCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html114 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH agencies use. The principal regulatory agencies of DHHS are FDA for drugs and biologics, medical devices, and certain foods and the Centers for Medi-care and Medicaid Services (CMS) for health care providers. Both CMS andFDA are responsible for regulatory oversight of laboratories (Boufford andLee, 2001). Other departments and agencies outside DHHS are also re-sponsible for regulations that protect health. 7 Collection and Dissemination of Information Timely and reliable data are an essential component of public health assessment, policy development, and assurance at all levels of government.DHHS, particularly the PHS agencies, sponsors a variety of public healthand health care data systems and activities. These include national vital andhealth statistics, household surveys on health and nutrition, health caredelivery cost and utilization information, and reporting requirements forprograms funded by federal grants or assistance. The National Center forHealth Statistics within CDC is the primary agency collecting and reportinghealth information for the federal government. CMS collects administrativedata on the Medicare and Medicaid programs and conducts beneficiarysurveys. The Administration for Children and Families and the Administra-tion on Aging also collect data on human services. Other agencies (e.g., theCensus Bureau, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department ofLabor) also collect data that are important for public health purposes. Inaddition, the collection and dissemination of research findings can be con-sidered part of this activity. 7 Federal agencies have developed numerous regulatory techniques and decision-making processes to identify and respond to health and safety risks (Gostin, 2000). Agencies can control entry into a field by requiring a license or permit to undertake specified activities; sethealth and safety standards, conduct inspections to ensure compliance, adjudicate violations, and impose penalties; abate nuisances that threaten the public; dispense grants, subsidies, or other incentives; and influence conduct through a wide variety of informal methods (Gostin,2000). For example, the Department of Agriculture regulates the safety of meat, poultry, and eggs. EPA regulates air and water pollution, pesticides, and toxic wastes. The Department of Energy oversees radiation-related environmental management, environmental safety andhealth, and civilian radioactive waste management. The Department of Labor regulates occu- pational health and safety and self-insured employee benefit plans. The Department of Trans- portation sets and monitors standards for highway safety. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,and Firearms in the Department of the Treasury, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration also issue regulations that protect the public against health risks (Boufford and Lee, 2001).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE 115 Capacity Building for Population Health The capacity-building function of the federal government centers on ensuring the ability of its own agencies to effectively discharge their respon-sibilities. It also centers on ensuring that state and local levels of govern-ment have the resources \u2014human, financial, and organizational \u2014they need to carry out the responsibilities delegated to them by the federal govern-ment or for which they are responsible by law as they work to assure andpromote the health of the communities that they serve. In terms of thepublic health infrastructure, this includes striving for effective collaborationwithin DHHS, between DHHS and other cabinet departments for domesticand international health policy, and between DHHS and state and localpublic health departments. With more than 200 categorical public healthprograms in DHHS and a variety of health-related programs in other fed-eral agencies, the alignment of policies and strategies is challenging. Thisalso makes it difficult to devise an approach to the systematic and account-able long-term investment of federal funding in governmental public healthagencies at the state and local levels. Direct Management of Services Federal funding supports the delivery of medical care through a variety of categorical grant programs (e.g., for community health centers and ma-ternal and child health services) and insurance programs (e.g., Medicaidand Medicare). However, the direct management of clinical or other ser-vices delivered to individuals is a small part of DHHS 's role. Under DHHS, direct medical care and public health services are provided primarily byIHS, which serves members of federally recognized American Indian tribes.As tribal governments assume greater responsibility for managing theseservices, the role of IHS could evolve into that of a payer or purchaserrather than a provider of services. In addition, DOD and VA play largerdirect management roles in the provision of health care services for theirparticular constituencies. The next section highlights the current status of certain critical compo- nents of the public health infrastructure that support the public healthsystem in carrying out essential public health functions. These componentsinclude the public health workforce, information and data systems, andpublic health laboratories. The section also reviews how these componentsof the infrastructure are critical to emergency preparedness and responseactivities.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

An ad-equately sized and appropriately trained workforce performing competentlyis an essential element of the public health infrastructure. The public healthworkforce at the federal, state, and local levels must be prepared to respondto an array of needs, such as the assurance of health-related environmentalsafety, the interpretation of scientific data that can influence health out-comes, or the clarification of vast amounts of highly technical informationafter a community emergency. In addition to meeting the scientific andtechnical requirements of public health practice, state and local public healthofficials are often expected to provide community leadership, manage com-munity reactions, and communicate about risk, protection, and prevention. Current estimates indicate that approximately 450,000 individuals are working in salaried public health positions, with many more contributingto this mission through nongovernmental organizations or on a voluntarybasis (HRSA, 2000). Public health practitioners have training in a variety ofdisciplines, including the biological and health sciences, psychology, educa-tion, nutrition, ethics, sociology, epidemiology, biostatistics, business, com-puter science, political science, law, public affairs, and urban planning. Recent studies have shown, however, that the current public health workforce is unevenly prepared to meet the challenges that accompany thepractice of public health today. An estimated 80 percent of the currentworkforce lacks formal training in public health (CDC-ATSDR, 2001).Moreover, the major changes in technology, biomedical knowledge,informatics, and community expectations will continue to challenge andredefine the practice of public health, requiring that current public healthpractitioners receive the additional, ongoing training and support they needto update their existing skills (Pew Health Professions Commission, 1998). Training and Education for the Public Health Workforce Competency-Based Training Given that early public health efforts in the United States were aimed at improving sanitation, controlling infectious diseases, assuring the safety offood and water supplies, and immunizing children, it is hardly surprisingthat public health workers at that time were predominantly graduates ofschools of medicine, nursing, and the biological sciences. Today, however,Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE 117 the public health workforce has broader responsibilities and must be much more diverse. For example, as part of the performance of essential services,members of the public health workforce must be prepared to engage thecommunity in effective actions to promote mental, physical, environmental,and social health. Advances in biomedical and genomics research and tech-nologies have the potential to change the way public health practitionersthink about population-level disease risk and how disease prevention andhealth promotion activities might be practiced. Moreover, rapidly evolvingcomputer and information technologies and the use of mass media andsocial marketing have the potential to revolutionize health departments ' access to up-to-date surveillance information, disease databases, and com-munications networks as well as to enhance worker productivity. The need to strengthen the public health workforce was recognized by IOM in 1988 and has been the focus of a variety of efforts since then. Someof these activities will be discussed in the chapter on the role of academia inthe public health system (Chapter 8). A few key efforts focusing on thecurrent workforce (rather than training new workers) are also covered here.In particular, the report The Public Health Workforce: An Agenda for the 21st Century (USPHS, 1997) called for greater leadership on workforce issues from national, state, and local public health agencies; use of a stan-dard taxonomy to better assess and monitor workforce composition;competency-based curriculum development; and greater use of new tech-nologies for distance learning. The Taskforce for Public Health WorkforceDevelopment, established in 1999 by CDC and ATSDR, recommended sixbroad strategies for a national public health workforce development agenda(CDC, 2000e): 1. Monitor current workforce composition and project future needs. 2. Identify competencies and develop curricula.3. Design integrated learning systems.4. Use incentives to promote public health practice competencies.5. Conduct and support evaluation and research.6. Assure financial support for a lifelong learning system in public health. An almost universal priority for workforce development is ensuring that all public health practitioners have mastery over a basic set of compe-tencies involving generalizable knowledge, skills, and abilities that allowthem to effectively and efficiently function as part of their public healthorganizations or systems (CDC-ATSDR, 2000; DHHS, 2000; CDC, 2001d)(see Appendix E for an extended list of competencies for public healthworkers). Many experienced public health professionals require a variety ofcross-cutting competencies to help them meet the routine and emergentCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Inaddition, a recent survey of the local public health infrastructure found thatseveral specific public health occupations are projected to be the mostneeded in the coming 5 years (NACCHO, 2001e). These occupations in-cluded public health nurses, epidemiologists, and environmental specialists(NACCHO, 2001e) (see Figure 3 -2). The Council on Linkages between Academia and Public Health Prac- tice 8 has developed a list of 68 core public health competencies in eight domains (see Box 3 -2), with different levels of competency expectations for frontline public health workers, senior professional staff, program special-ists, and leaders (Council on Linkages between Academia and Public HealthPractice, 2001). An expert panel convened by CDC, ATSDR, and HRSAhas recommended adoption of this list as the basis for competency-basedtraining of the public health workforce (CDC, 2000e). Use of this list as thebasis for training and continuing education for the public health workforceFIGURE 3 -2 Public health occupations most needed in 5 years. 8 The Council on Linkages between Academia and Public Health Practice is composed of leaders from national organizations representing the public health practice and academic communities. The council grew out of the Public Health Faculty/Agency Forum, which devel-oped recommendations for improving the relevance of public health education to the de- mands of public health in the practice sector. The council and its partners have focused attention on the need for a public health practice research agenda.28%Public Health Nurses 28% Environmental Specialists 21%Health Educators 13%IT Specialists 5%Epidemiologists 5%All OthersCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Efforts are under way in the various publichealth training networks to establish models that will contribute to a sys-tematic approach to competency-based training that is linked to the essen-tial services framework and grounded in prior competency validation ef-forts (CDC, 2000e). Meeting the Needs for Workforce Development The issue of workforce training and competency is central to the suc- cess of any public health system. Governmental public health agencies havea responsibility to identify the public health workforce needs within theirjurisdictions and to implement policies and programs to fill those needs. Inaddition, an assessment of current competency levels and needs is essentialto develop and deliver the appropriate competency-based training, as wellas to evaluate the impact of that training in practice settings. Workforcetraining and education efforts may be conducted in partnership withacademia and other relevant and appropriate community partners, andideally, a percentage of public health employees should be targeted annu-ally for continuing education (DHHS, 2000). These and other issues arediscussed in the 2003 IOM report Who Will Keep the Public Healthy: Educating Public Health Professionals for the 21st Century . Training resources for the public health workforce are expanding, spurred by modest funding by HRSA for Public Health Training Centersand by CDC for Public Health Preparedness Centers. By mid-2002, therewere 14 Training Centers and 15 Preparedness Centers, which form thebackbone of a national public health training network.

Given the importance of the workforce in carrying out the mission of public health, the committee finds that education and development of thecurrent workforce must continue to be a fundamental priority within thebroader efforts to improve the state and local public health infrastructure.Therefore, the committee recommends that all federal, state, and local governmental public health agencies develop strategies to ensure that publichealth workers who are involved in the provision of essential public healthservices demonstrate mastery of the core public health competencies appro-priate to their jobs. The Council on Linkages between Academia and PublicHealth Practice should also encourage the competency development of pub-lic health professionals working in public health system roles in for-profitand nongovernmental entities. To facilitate ongoing workforce development, the committee encour- ages public health agencies to engage in training partnerships with academiato ensure the availability of coordinated, continuous, and accessible sys-tems of education. These systems should be capable of addressing a varietyof workforce training needs, ranging from education on the basic compe-tencies to continuing education for individuals in the specialized profes-sional disciplines of public health science. Furthermore, the committee recommends that Congress designate funds for CDC and HRSA to periodically assess the preparedness of the publichealth workforce, to document the training necessary to meet basic compe-tency expectations, and to advise on the funding necessary to provide suchtraining. Preparing Public Health Leaders Senior public health officials must have the preparation not only to manage a government agency but also to provide guidance to the workforcewith regard to health goals or priorities, interact with stakeholders andconstituency groups, provide policy direction to a governing board, andinteract with other agencies at all levels of government whose actions anddecisions affect the population whose health they are trying to assure(Turnock, 2000). These tasks require a unique and demanding set of tal-ents: professional expertise in the specific subject area; substantive expertisein the content and values of public health; and competencies in the coreskills of leadership. Those who have mastery of the skills to mobilize,coordinate, and direct broad collaborative actions within the complex pub-lic health system must lead in implementing the actions outlined in thisreport. They require the skills for vision, communication, and implementa-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Although many of these skills are innate for most professionals and other leaders, they need constant refinement and honing. CDC has pioneered the development and funding of a national Public Health Leadership Institute, and in the intervening dozen years, more than500 leaders in public health have been exposed to leadership training andskill building (described in more detail in the Academia chapter). Further-more, a similar network of State and Regional Public Health LeadershipInstitutes has been funded and, over time, has developed the capacity towork collaboratively through a national network, which permits institutesto benchmark and share best practices and continue the process of learningneeded to help with state-of-the art curriculum and educational trainingefforts. Equally notable has been the development of the ManagementAcademy for Public Health, a joint effort of the major public health philan-thropies. Although effort is still at an early stage, this academy has alreadygenerated graduates who work hand in glove with senior leadership inpublic health organizations. Furthermore, the Turning Point Initiative de-votes efforts to increasing collaborative leadership across all sectors and atall levels (Larson et al., 2002) Another key to leadership is continuity in office long enough to exert the leadership and to provide the institutional memory to defend publichealth agencies and the public health sector from the political winds of themoment. Yet, the committee finds there has been great difficulty in recruit-ing, developing, and retaining the leaders so vital to the job. A state health official 's term, if that official is a political appointee, is tied to the governor 's term. Health officials must work with legislators who operate on 2-year terms. Given that the average tenure of a state healthofficer is relatively short (an average of 3.9 years and a median of 2.9 years)(ASTHO, 2002), many state health officials find it difficult to create longer-term plans for achieving health goals on shorter-term time frames (Meit,2001). Additionally, because state health officers report to many governingbodies, they generally have less direct access to policy makers, and statehealth officials must prioritize the issues that they think deserve the mostattention (Meit, 2001). Political factors at the state level can also have asignificant impact on the abilities of public health leadership to influencepolicy. To address the specific issues of discontinuity occasioned by therapid turnover, particularly of state health officials, the Robert WoodJohnson Foundation has funded a unique State Health Leadership Initiativeadministered by the National Governors Association to immerse newlyappointed officials in a curriculum for political leadership and provide anetwork of resources and mentors. Governmental public health leadership is a critical component of the infrastructure that must be strengthened, supported, and held accountableby all of the partners of the public health system and the community atCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

For this reason, the committee recommends that leadership training, support, and development be a high priority for governmental public healthagencies and other organizations in the public health system and for schoolsof public health that supply the public health infrastructure with its profes-sionals and leaders. Considering Credentialing as a Tool for Workforce Development Credentialing is a mechanism that is used to certify specific levels of professional preparation. There are many different forms of credentials,including academic degrees, professional certifications, and licenses. Forexample, medical credentials include medical degrees to certify successfulcompletion of course work, professional testing (e.g., through medical boardexams) to provide evidence of qualification to practice medicine, and medi-cal licensing to establish compliance with state standards for medical prac-tice. An individual credentialed as a Certified Health Education Specialist(CHES) has successfully completed a course of study and passed a compe-tency-based test. Although some public health workers are credentialed as physicians, nurses, health educators, or environmental health practitioners, few arecredentialed within those professions specifically for public health practice.Most physicians working in public health lack board certification in pre-ventive medicine or public health; most nurses working in public healthlack credentials in community public health nursing; and most individualsworking as health educators lack the CHES credential. Furthermore, nosingle credentialing or certification process has been established to test thevarious competencies required for the interdisciplinary field of public health;thus, the majority of the public health workforce (80 percent) lacks creden-tials (HRSA, 2000). Given the importance of establishing and maintaining a competent public health workforce, CDC and other public health agencies and organi-zations, including NACCHO, the Association of State and TerritorialHealth Officials (ASTHO), the Association of Schools of Public Health,and the American Public Health Association (APHA), are examining thefeasibility of creating a credentialing system for public health workers basedon competencies linked to the essential public health services framework.CDC (2001d) has recommended the use of credentialing. Such a processwould complement efforts to establish national public health performancestandards for state and local public health systems based on the essentialpublic health services framework and the related objectives of Healthy People 2010 (Objective 23 -11) (DHHS, 2000). Although this national ef- fort focuses on experienced public health leaders, support is growing for theconcept of credentialing at a basic level all public health workers and at anCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE 123 intermediate level the experienced professionals from many disciplines who share the need for higher-level, cross-cutting competencies in the areas ofpublic health practice, community health assessment, policy development,communication, and program development and evaluation. Certification or credentialing would help establish that public health practitioners have a demonstrated level of accomplishment in and masteryof the principles of public health practice. In terms of building the capacityof the public health workforce, the credentialing process could help docu-ment the knowledge, skills, and performance of experienced workers whomay not have formal academic training and could encourage other workersto seek additional training to meeting credentialing requirements. An espe-cially important component of this process is that it could play a key role inshaping the training and preparation of future public health practitionersand leaders. The key challenge is whether and how public health organizations can begin to integrate competency-based credentialing in their hiring, promo-tion, performance appraisal, and salary structures. Although the idea ofcredentialing has considerable support at the federal level, states and par-ticularly localities have voiced concerns that workforce credentialing man-dates may become too closely tied to federal funding mechanisms. In thesesituations, the fiscal impact could be grave for public health departmentsthat do not or cannot meet credentialing requirements (community infor-mants, personal communications to the committee, 2001). The committee finds that in the ongoing debate about public health workforce credentialing, what is most needed is a national dialogue thatcan address the full range of issues and concerns. Therefore, the committee recommends that a formal national dialogue be initiated to address theissue of public health workforce credentialing. The Secretary of DHHSshould appoint a national commission on public health workforcecredentialing to lead this dialogue. The commission should be charged withdetermining if a credentialing system would further the goal of creating acompetent workforce and, if applicable, the manner and time frame forimplementation by governmental public health agencies at all levels. Thedialogue should include representatives from federal, state, and local publichealth agencies, academia, and public health professional organizationswho can represent and discuss the various perspectives on the workforcecredentialing debate. Special Need for Communication Skills The role of communication in public health practice cannot be underes- timated. It is crucial for the successful performance of public health 's core functions and essential services. Governmental public health agencies mustCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html124 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH communicate effectively internally as well as externally with other govern- mental agencies and nongovernmental stakeholders and partners. Inform-ing and advising the public about health promotion and disease preventionare standard duties of both state and local public health agencies, andlistening to community voices is also critical for programs to be effective. Inemergency situations, public health professionals must have the ability tocommunicate clearly and effectively \u2014being aggressive and credible enough to command attention \u2014with both the public and other officials about the nature of the health hazards and the steps necessary to minimize healthrisks. The response to the discovery of anthrax exposures in the fall of 2001 brought into sharp focus the importance of effective communication in theface of serious health risks. According to New York Times medical reporter Dr. Lawrence Altman, lapses and delays in communication with the publicand with public health and health care professionals could have made thesituation worse had the anthrax exposures been more widespread (Altman,2001). Altman found that the delay was attributed in part to Federal Emer-gency Response Act restrictions about disclosing information and to theFederal Bureau of Investigation 's (FBI 's) criminal investigation. Altman suggested, however, that CDC could have issued information as a part ofthe parallel public health investigation that was already under way. Theinitial paucity of information on anthrax and the investigations in theMorbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR ), one of CDC 's most valuable means of quickly informing public health and health care profes-sionals about communicable diseases, was also noted (Altman, 2001).MMWR 's editor reported being \"out of the [information] loop \" for some time (Altman, 2001). It should be noted that CDC used the Health AlertNetwork many times after September 11, 2001, to alert public health offi-cials and to disseminate information. The federal government 's handling of the anthrax attacks also prompted criticism of DHHS for uncoordinated communication as well as a convo-luted and inadequate public communication strategy (Connolly, 2001). Forexample, as reported by the press, the department 's initial decisions to direct all media requests through the Secretary 's press office effectively silenced CDC, FDA, and NIH, the agencies with the most relevant expertise(Connolly, 2001). The lack of information from DHHS was also frustratingto other federal, state, and local leaders and governmental public healthofficials, some of whom learned about new cases and contamination intheir states though network and cable television newscasts (Connolly, 2001).The lesson from these and other communication breakdowns is evident:clear and effective communication, both internal and external, is a criticalservice of the governmental public health infrastructure. Under more normal circumstances, public health communication isCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE 125 important for gathering information from the community about their health concerns as well as delivering and even \"marketing \" health information to the public. Because the responsibilities of public health agencies cover allaspects of health, public health officials are in a unique position to providetimely, accurate health-related information to the public on a wide varietyof topics, ranging from depression and other mental health issues to obesityand physical activity, environmental health and safety, emergency prepared-ness, and policies that affect health or health outcomes. However, few public health agencies have staff members who are trained to interact effectively with the public and to work effectively withthe news media. In fact, the most recent examination of the public healthworkforce indicated that 575 individuals in the public health workforcehave the expertise to be classified in the category of \"Public Relations/ Media Specialist \" (HRSA, 2000). Of these 575 people, most are working in DHHS and other federal health agencies. Of the others, 115 are working instate and territorial public health agencies and 12 are working in voluntaryagencies (HRSA, 2000). Given the tremendous potential of the mass media and evolving infor- mation technologies, such as the Internet, to influence the knowledge, nor-mative beliefs, and behavior patterns of individuals and groups, govern-mental public health agencies must be prepared to use these communicationtools. The public health workforce must have sufficient expertise in com-munications to be able to engage diverse audiences with public healthinformation and messages and to work with the media to ensure the accu-racy of the health-related information they convey to the public. For ex-ample, public health officials can develop relationships with journalists andassist them in accurately representing health risks and interpreting the sig-nificance of new research findings so that reporting on public health issuesis accurate and members of the public can make informed decisions aboutprotecting their health. For these reasons, the committee finds that communication skills and competencies are crucial to the effective performance of the 10 essentialpublic health services and the practice of public health at the federal, state,and local levels. Therefore, the committee recommends that all partners within the public health system place special emphasis on communicationas a critical core competency of public health practice. Governmental pub-lic health agencies at all levels should use existing and emerging tools(including information technologies) for effective management of publichealth information and for internal and external communication. To beeffective, such communication must be culturally appropriate and suitableto the literacy levels of the individuals in the communities they serve. To build this capacity in the public health workforce, communications skillsand competencies should be included in the curricula of all workforceCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html126 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH development programs. Communication competencies should include train- ing in risk communication, interpersonal and group methods for gatheringand transmitting information, and interfacing with the public about publichealth information and issues, as well as the interpretation of health-relatednews. This is addressed in greater detail in a companion report, Who Will Keep the Public Healthy: Educating Public Health Professionals for the21st Century (IOM, 2003). Information Networks Information and the systems through which it is produced are critical tools that enable public health agencies to meet their responsibilities formonitoring health status and for identifying health hazards and risks to the populations they serve. Public healthagencies also rely on information andinformation systems to assess commu-nities ' resources and their capacity to respond to health needs and problems.Such assessments inform the interven-tions and policies designed to addressthe community 's health needs (Keppel and Freedman, 1995). It is essential thatthe governmental public health infra-structure have a system that is capableof supporting the collection, analysis,and application of myriad forms ofhealth-related data and information. The committee uses the term \"information \" in its most general form, referring to three distinct terms in information science: data, information,and knowledge. Data are the essential elements of information; that is, dataare the measurements and facts about an individual, an environment, or acommunity. Information is what is generated when data are placed in contextvia the tool of analysis. When rules are applied to the information, knowl-edge is generated (Lumpkin, 2001). All of these elements \u2014data, information, and knowledge \u2014are critical products of public health information networks. Of particular concern for the public health infrastructure are interre- lated weaknesses in the nation 's disease surveillance systems and inad- equate access to information systems and communication tools. The com-mittee emphasizes the need for an integrated information infrastructure toovercome many of these problems.Without adequate surveillance, local, state, and federal officials cannot know the true scope of existing health problems and may not recognize new diseases until many people have been affected.

All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE 127 Surveillance Efforts and Reporting Systems For communicable diseases, effective epidemiological surveillance can make the difference between the rapid identification and treatment of a fewcases of disease and an outbreak that debilitates an entire community.Responsibility for surveillance, one of the most important functions of thepublic health infrastructure, is shared among federal, state, and local publichealth agencies. States and localities collect and report data; and federalagencies, especially CDC, in the case of infectious and chronic diseases,provide valuable technical support, training, and grant funding (GAO,1999a). The rapid development of new information technology offers the po- tential for a greatly improved surveillance capacity. For example, it is nowpossible to engage in real-time data collection via the Internet and throughlinkages to electronic patient records. New technologies also offer the po-tential for automated data analyses, such as pattern recognition softwarethat would be able to detect unusual disease patterns. Moreover, new tech-nologies offer new options for disseminating the information produced bysurveillance efforts (Baxter et al., 2000). However, the nation 's surveillance capacity is weakened by fragmentation and gaps. Fragmentation of Surveillance Systems Fragmentation has developed in surveillance systems in part because legal authority for surveillance rests with states and localities and they havenot developed uniform standards for data elements, collection procedures,storage, and transmission. The lack of uniformity has made it difficult forstates and localities to work collaboratively among themselves or with theprivate sector to develop more effective surveillance systems. Although The Future of Public Health recommended the development of a uniform na- tional health data set (IOM, 1988), progress has been limited. Requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountabil- ity Act (HIPAA; P.L. 104 -191) for the development and use of comprehen- sive new standards for the electronic transmission of health informationmay result in greater consistency of certain types of data. However, there isuncertainty about the scope of the rules under HIPAA, and state and localhealth departments must determine what portion of their electronic healthinformation might be subject to the requirements established by HIPAA(ASTHO, 2001a, 2001b). Another key factor shaping the development of surveillance systems is that, historically, investment in these systems has been largely categorical,resulting in fragmentation of surveillance efforts across the spectrum ofinfectious disease threats and other programs for other specific diseases andCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html128 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH populations. An inventory of public health data projects and systems iden- tified more than 200 separate DHHS data systems in seven broad program-matic areas (Boufford and Lee, 2001). The multiplicity of surveillance sys-tems for food-borne illnesses illustrates the problem (see Box 3 -3). A lack of integration in federal data systems helps drive fragmentation at the state and local levels. Data collected in accordance with the specifica-tions of separate federal programs often cannot be accessed at the locallevel because of differences in formats, definitions, classification systems,personal identifiers, or sampling strategies (Lumpkin et al., 1995). Thefragmentation means that state and local public health agencies inevitablymust spend time on duplicative data-reporting activities that drain alreadyscarce staff resources (GAO, 1999a). The current combination of systemincompatibility and lack of integration hinders the ability of program man-agers to know what information exists and how to access that informationand hinders the ability of local health agencies to provide integrated care totheir communities (Lumpkin et al., 1995). CDC 's National Electronic Dis- ease Surveillance System (NEDSS) is working to electronically integrate anumber of surveillance activities; details can be found in the discussion ofinformation systems later in this chapter. Gaps in Surveillance Existing surveillance activities contain notable gaps. In particular, little information is routinely collected on chronic diseases and conditions, suchas asthma and diabetes, even though chronic diseases account for four ofevery five deaths in the United States and annually cost the nation approxi-mately $325 billion in health care and lost worker productivity (Pew Envi-ronmental Health Commission, 2000). Similarly, environmental pollutantsand toxins are monitored primarily for the purposes of environmental pro-tection and regulation, but no surveillance and tracking system monitorsthe health outcomes, such as birth defects and developmental disorders,that are potentially linked to toxic exposures. With an improved awarenessof these health risks and a more comprehensive understanding of the healthstatus of the population, public health agencies from the federal to the locallevel would be able to design better interventions and prevention efforts. The Pew Environmental Health Commission (1999, 2000) has called for the development of a national health-tracking network to monitor the preva-lence of chronic conditions such as asthma and for the development of nationalbirth defects registries. Ideally, these comprehensive disease registries and sur-veillance networks would be accessible to and used by state and local publichealth agencies to better understand and monitor the health status of thecommunities they serve. Additionally, these registries would have the potentialto be linked with registries from private health care delivery organizationsCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Of these, only four principal systems focus exclusively on food-borne illnesses and cover more than one pathogen: 1. The Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System (FDOSS) collects nationwide data about the incidence and causes of food-borne outbreaks. It relies on local health officials to take the initiative to report outbreaks to CDC through their state public health officials. CDC and others use thissystem mainly to maintain awareness of ongoing problems. 2. FoodNet actively collects information in nine geographic areas on nine spe- cific food-borne pathogens, as well as complication of Campylobacter infection), and toxoplasmosis. Public health officials who participate in FoodNet receive federal funds fromCDC to systematically contact laboratories in their general area and solicit incidence data. This system provides more accurate estimates of the occur- rence of food-borne diseases than are otherwise available. 3. PulseNet is used to identify whether separate cases of illness are likely to have originated from the same source. Using this system, public health officials can compare the new patterns to other patterns in the database;matches indicate an outbreak. 4. The Surveillance Outbreak Detection Algorithm (SODA) focuses on Salmo- nella and Shigella and uses statistical analyses to compare current data against a historical baseline to detect unusual increases in the incidence of these two pathogens. Increases may indicate an outbreak. Although these four systems have contributed to improved food safety, the usefulness of the systems is marred both by the untimely release of the surveil- lance data and by gaps in the collected data. Twenty-six of the General AccountingOffice survey respondents said that delays in publishing data from the FDOSS diminished the usefulness of the system. Many also said that rapid release of data from FoodNet, PulseNet, and SODA would make these systems more useful. CDC attributed the delays in data dissemination to shortages in staffing. Addi- tional staff have been hired since then, and they are training state and local health officials about the reporting needs of both state health departments and CDC(GAO, 2001a). However, CDC also noted that some of the delays in releasing information were due to the occasionally untimely reporting of surveillance data by state and local public health officials. Survey respondents said the problem iscaused in part by shortages of trained epidemiologists in state and local health departments and by deficiencies in laboratory capabilities. Survey respondents also noted that the decisions regarding which diseases are tracked are made atthe state level, which adds to the variability and incompleteness of the data when they are aggregated at the national level. continuedCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The Pew Environmental Health Commission reports and recommendations have beenendorsed by major public health organizations, including APHA, ASTHO, theAssociation of Public Health Laboratories, the Council of State and TerritorialEpidemiologists (CSTE), NACCHO, and the Public Health Foundation (PHF).The committee strongly supports this recommendation and applauds the U.S.Congress for providing $17.5 million for the development and implementationof a nationwide environmental health-tracking network and capacity develop-ment in environmental health in state and local health departments (Confer-ence Report Accompanying H.R. 3061, 2002). Another gap in the current disease surveillance system is syndrome surveillance, which captures data on the basis of clinical signs and symp-toms of illness (e.g., a fever or rash), not just formal diagnoses of specificdiseases. Related indicators for such surveillance might be sales of prescrip-tion and nonprescription medications. Interest in syndrome surveillance hasgrown because of its potential value for early detection of disease out-breaks, including those that might result from a bioterrorist act. Such asystem depends on the rapid aggregation and assessment of data to permitdetection of clinical and geographic patterns. Although no national syndrome surveillance network is in operation, some state and local public health agencies are beginning to test and imple-ment such systems. For example, New York City has had an active syn-drome surveillance system since the 1990s (LLGIS, 2001), and systems arealso operating in the Seattle -King County Department of Public Health (Duchin, 2002) and the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare (1999).Syndrome surveillance systems played an important role during the anthraxoutbreaks in New York City and in the Washington, D.C., area. These systems generally require partnerships with practicing physicians, hospital emergency rooms and outpatient departments, community-basedclinics, and sometimes neighboring state and county health departments. ATo help states address some of these issues and submit more complete infor- mation, CDC is providing funds to state and local public health departments to helpreduce some of their staffing and technology limitations. Additionally, CDC is en- tering into cooperative agreements with the Council of State and Territorial Epide- miologists and the Association of Public Health Laboratories to encourage morestandardized reporting among states and to assess states ' capabilities and capac- ities to address public health issues, including food-borne disease.BOX 3 -3 ContinuedCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

RSVP incorporates a real-time medical database and allows electronic data linkages with all localhealth departments throughout the state, the four district offices and theirsatellites, and the state offices. At the federal level, CDC 's Enhanced Surveillance Project (ESP) is work- ing with state and local health departments and information systems con-tractors to develop real-time syndrome surveillance and analytical methods(CDC, 2001d). During special events, ESP sites monitor data on emergencydepartment visits at sentinel hospitals. These data are analyzed at CDC andreported back to the health departments for confirmation and appropriatefollow-up. ESP has been tested at events such as the Republican and Demo-cratic National Conventions in 2000 and the 2002 Olympic Games in Utah(CDC, 2001d). DOD (2002), through its Global Emerging Infections Sur-veillance and Response System, is evaluating a system for the rapid identifi-cation of disease-related syndromes in patients at military health care facili-ties in the Washington, D.C., area. The committee notes that although these syndrome surveillance pro- grams show promise, their widespread effectiveness is still being evaluatedand no syndrome surveillance system has identified a potential biologicalemergency. A forthcoming report (2003) by the IOM Committee on Emerg-ing Microbial Threats to Health in the 21st Century addresses syndromesurveillance in more detail. Information Systems and Communications Tools New Systems and Technologies Several initiatives have emerged to try to resolve the problems of frag- mentation and incompatibility in the nation 's disease surveillance systems and to gain the benefits of integrated health data networks and communica-tions systems. A key 1995 report, Integrating Public Health Information and Surveillance Systems , documented the problems and recommended a framework for leadership on the issue as well as specific steps for achievingthe long-term vision of integration of public health information and surveil-lance systems (CDC, 1995). After publication of that report, CDC estab- 9 Sandia is a multiprogram engineering and science laboratory operated by Sandia Corpo- ration, a Lockheed Martin Company, for the Department of Energy 's National Nuclear Secu- rity Administration.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

If ad-equately supported, the board could provide an ongoing coordinatingmechanism for CDC and ATSDR to lead the integration of public healthinformation systems. In 1992, CDC developed the Information Network for Public Health Officials (INPHO) in collaboration with state health departments. INPHOwas established to foster communication between public and private part-ners, to make information more accessible, and to allow the rapid andsecure exchange of data (GAO, 1999a). By 1997, 14 states had begunINPHO projects, some combining their INPHO resources with other CDCgrant funds to build statewide networks linking state and local public healthdepartments. Some states ' networks include links to private laboratories. The system has produced measurable benefits in some states. For example,in Washington State, electronic information-sharing systems reduced thepassive reporting time from 35 days to 1 day and gave both local authori-ties and the School of Public Health at the University of Washington accessto health data for analysis (Davies and Jernigan, 1998; P. Wahl, personalcommunication, February 2, 2002). The recommendations of the 1995 report have also led CDC to develop NEDSS (CDC, 2000b). Although the system is now in the early stages ofdevelopment, one of its objectives is to electronically integrate a variety ofsurveillance activities, including the National Electronic Telecommunica-tions System for Surveillance and the reporting systems for HIV/AIDS,tuberculosis, vaccine-preventable diseases, and infectious diseases. It is alsointended to facilitate more accurate and timely disease reporting to CDCand state and local public health departments. NEDSS will incorporate datastandards, an Internet-based communication infrastructure that is designedaccording to industry and public policy standards on data access and shar-ing, confidentiality protection, and burden reduction (CDC, 2000b). CDC has also developed the Epidemic Information Exchange (Epi-X). This system, which became operational in November 2000, enables secure,web-based communication among federal, state, and local epidemiologists,laboratories, and other members of the public health community and allowsthem to instantly notify others about urgent public health events and searchthe Epi-X database for information on outbreaks and unusual health events. Another initiative, the Health Alert Network, emphasizes the commu- nication capabilities that are necessary for more integrated informationsystems. It was designed as a system for electronic communication betweenhealth departments and CDC, with the Internet used as its backbone (CDC,2000c). It also supports distance-learning activities and provides healthdepartments at all levels with the capacity to broadcast and receive healthCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE 133 alerts (CDC, 2000c). Although parts of this system are still in development, CDC used the Health Alert Network at noon on September 11, 2001, toadvise public health officials to begin heightened disease surveillance(NACCHO, 2001b). In support of these various activities, CDC is adopting information technology standards and procedures to establish a secure data network(SDN). Network development focuses on the technical requirements formaintaining the confidentiality of data and providing a secure method forencrypting and transferring files from state health departments to a CDCprogram application via the Internet. The SDN not only gives CDC severalways of obtaining data from states, but it also provides a consistent methodfor authenticating the transmission source and ensuring data integrity (CDC,2000c). A public health information network is under consideration atCDC to serve as a vehicle, with an effective governance mechanism, toensure the integration of existing public health information systems withinCDC and coordinated development of future ones with state and localpublic health agencies. Although the committee applauds the development of these important systems and coordination efforts, it is concerned about the apparent lack ofan effective mechanism to ensure their integration or their coordinationwith future efforts to create a fully developed national health informationinfrastructure, which we strongly support. Continuing Problems Despite these efforts, the public health information infrastructure is not yet fully capable of handling situations for which rapid, clear communica-tion and information transfer are essential. Because the integration of pub-lic health data and information net-works has not yet been accomplished,state and local public health agenciesare still obliged to operate the morethan 100 disparate data systems whoselack of integration slows the flow ofinformation in times of crisis. Data andinformation network integration mustalso take into account the new data andinformation systems under develop-ment. Many of these new systems havenot been fully implemented across thenation or, in the case of Epi-X, have been implemented only at the statelevel, leaving localities with read-only terminals and other tools that pre-vent interactive access to information or, even worse, leaving them out of Early detection and response is critical, and it all hinges on com- munications and information technology.

Furthermore, many local public health agencies, especially those in small and remote communities,do not have the resources or technical capacity to handle the implementa-tion of new information technology, which requires expensive and compli-cated hardware and software. These disparities result in some states andlocalities having easy access to updated or urgent information, whereasothers must continue to rely on the now-antiquated methods of paper-based reports, telephone connections, and the U.S. Postal Service as theirprimary means of retrieving and reporting information. These weaknesses were demonstrated clearly during the bioterrorism events of October 2001. Despite the years of warning about the potentialfor such attacks, only half of the nation 's state, local, and territorial public health departments had full-time Internet connectivity when the first an-thrax case was reported on October 4. Another 20 percent of state, local,and territorial health agencies lacked e-mail and, therefore, were unable toreceive electronic updates regarding the anthrax events (Brewin, 2001).Given that robust and smoothly functioning information and communica-tions networks are the key to defending against a bioterrorist attack, manyof the nation 's public health agencies were left unprepared. Since September 11, 2001, public health agencies and officials have repeatedly urged the U.S. Congress to increase the levels of funding devotedto improving the nation 's public health information infrastructure. The recommendations in CDC 's review of this infrastructure specifically em- phasized the need to ensure that health departments at all levels have accessto modern means of rapid electronic data exchange and communication(CDC, 2001c). Although the current bioterrorism preparedness appropria-tions ($40 million) are directed toward the Health Alert Network and Epi-X (CSTE, 2001), these are just two of the systems necessary for enhanced,comprehensive disease surveillance (NACCHO, 2001e). It is possible thatadditional appropriations for bioterrorism or emergency preparedness maybe able to provide more resources for the improvement of the other compo-nents of the nation 's surveillance and information networks. Moving Toward a National Health Information Infrastructure Through the Telecommunications Act of 1993, the nation embarked on an effort to develop a National Information Infrastructure (NII), some-times called the Information Super Highway (Boufford and Lee, 2001). TheNational Health Information Infrastructure (NHII) is the health compo-nent of this effort. Whereas some parts of the federal government, such asthe Department of Commerce and the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration, have moved ahead quickly on their NII agendas, the areasCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS), the key external advisory body on data activities to the Secretary of DHHS, hasoutlined a vision and a process for building NHII. The report Information for Health: A Strategy for Building the National Health Information Infra-structure (NCVHS, 2002) presents the core of the vision as the pulling together of many separate initiatives and systems into an integrated datasystem that will give health officials and others optimal access to the infor-mation and knowledge they need to make the best possible health decisionsfor communities. The report 's recommendations are comprehensive, stress- ing the importance of information flow to the public and across sectors ofthe public health system and attaching equal importance to consumer,clinical, and population health dimensions (NCVHS, 2002). To ensure thatNHII supports all facets of individual health, health care, and communityhealth, it must be developed in a manner that takes into account humanfactors (e.g., values and relationships), institutional requirements (e.g., prac-tices, laws, and standards), and technological components (e.g., systemsand applications). NHII, when implemented, could have a profound impact on the effec- tiveness, efficiency, and overall quality of health and health care in theUnited States. It would allow the public health system and others to addressconcerns such as public health emergencies, medical errors, and healthdisparities in a more timely and comprehensive fashion (NCVHS, 2002).The links to data from the health care delivery system are critical to statepublic health agency efforts to monitor the quality of health care. Thecommunity aspects of population health are ripe for development as part ofNHII because of the emerging scientific insight into the nature of health andits determinants (see Chapter 2). Better access to information on communi-ties and their subpopulations will help health professionals and others iden-tify various health threats, problems related to social or environmentalconditions, and the unique needs of vulnerable populations. More powerfulinformation tools will help identify patterns and trends from isolated events,and the rapid communication afforded by the network will aid in informingand educating individuals and the community at large about critical healthissues. The committee agrees with NCVHS that the nation 's public health interest is served by the development of a standardized approach to aninformation infrastructure and that the development of a comprehensive,integrated system is a federal responsibility. Therefore, the committee rec- ommends that the Secretary of DHHS provide leadership to facilitate thedevelopment and implementation of the National Health Information In-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Implementation of NHII should take into account, where possible, the findings and recommendations of the National Com-mittee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS) working group on NHII.Congress should consider options for funding the development and deploy-ment of NHII (e.g., in support of clinical care, health information for thepublic, and public health practice and research) through payment changes,tax credits, subsidized loans, or grants. In carrying out this responsibility, CDC should ensure that this system is easily accessible and can be used and maintained by public health agen-cies at the federal, state, and local levels. This system should include theestablishment of standards for consistent data collection and transmissionpractices, the assurance of privacy protections, the capacity for transmis-sion of urgent health alerts across all levels of the public health system, andthe implementation of data systems that facilitate reporting, analysis, anddissemination. CDC should work with its public health partners to ensureadequate and ongoing training in the effective use of the techniques thatcomprise this system. Although this system is critical for the fulfillment ofthe essential services of public health, it should also be both respectful ofthe need for privacy protections and mindful of the need for efficient dataexchange. The exact cost of a comprehensive NHII needs to be determined. Esti- mates by Lee and colleagues (2001) indicate a total need of about $14billion over 10 years. This would be a combination of federal, state, local,and private-sector funds ramping up to a peak investment of $1.7 billionper year in 2007 and flattening out for the remaining years; the amountsneeded to sustain the system after that period were not estimated. Public Health Laboratories Public health laboratories are a critical component of the disease sur- veillance resources of the public health infrastructure, providing essentialcapacity to detect, identify, and monitor the presence of infectious or toxicagents in populations and the environments in which those populationslive. Investigations in these laboratories resulted in the identification of theorganisms that cause diphtheria, cholera, tuberculosis, Hansen 's disease (leprosy), and typhoid fever, paving the way for the development of vac-cines and treatments to prevent and control those diseases (Valdiserri,1993). Public health laboratories are also described as the safety net be-tween the local water plant and the kitchen tap in many communities(APHL, 2000); they provide laboratory support for epidemiological studiesand perform diagnostic tests (such as cytology testing and neonatal screen-ing) that may influence the treatment of individual patients. Moreover,public health laboratories provide leadership to set laboratory regulationsCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE 137 and serve as the standard of excellence for local and private laboratory performance (APHL, 2002a). In 1999, the General Accounting Office (GAO) (1999a) reported that the nation had 158,000 clinical laboratories, of which 90,000 were inphysicians ' offices. About 10,000 laboratories were in hospitals or were privately operated. Every state public health department operates at leastone laboratory, and some local health departments have laboratory facili-ties. Federal laboratories, such as those operated by CDC, provide testingservices and consultation not available at the state level and training intesting methods (GAO, 1999b). CDC 's Division of Laboratory Systems supports extramural and intramural research and oversees a laboratorystandards program that describes laboratory practices and services and thatassesses parameters for measuring and testing quality (CDC, 2001c). High-est priority is given to research on testing of diseases that are of the greatestpublic health importance (e.g., HIV and tuberculosis) and research to en-hance the standards under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amend-ments (CLIA) (e.g., genetic testing and cervical cytology). 10 GAO (1999a) also recommended that the CDC director lead an effort by federal, state, and local public health officials to establish a consensus onthe core laboratory capacities needed at each level of government. Thisinformation will aid policy makers in assessing whether existing resourcesare adequate and evaluating where investments are most needed. With regard to the financing of state public health laboratories, unpub- lished survey data from the Association of Public Health Laboratories(APHL) show that in FY 2001, public health laboratories received a medianof 50 percent of their funding from states, with a median of 33 percent fromfee-for-service funding and about 15 percent from the federal government(S. Becker, Executive Director of APHL, personal communication, June 13,2002). Although these percentages reflect the funding data obtained byAPHL for both FY 1999 and FY 2001, the trend is that state funding forpublic health laboratories has been decreasing and fee-for-service fundinghas been increasing, potentially encouraging laboratories to increase theirlevels of fee-for-service activities. Although federal funding has remainedrelatively constant, the recent increases in federal funding for bioterrorism 10 CLIA, enacted by Congress in 1988, mandated a broad and wide-ranging change in the regulation of laboratories that perform testing for medical diagnoses. CLIA expanded federal regulatory authority to approximately 170,000 laboratories, most of which were previouslyunregulated laboratories in physicians ' offices. In 1997, these laboratories performed an esti- mated 8 billion tests at a cost of approximately $30 billion. In June 1991, the Secretary of DHHS delegated responsibility for development and implementation of the scientific andtechnical aspects of the regulations to CDC. Within CDC, the Division of Laboratory Sys- tems, Public Health Practice Program Office, carries out the responsibility of standards devel- opment and laboratory improvement, whereas CMS administers the program (CDC, 2001c).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html138 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH and emergency preparedness and response are likely to increase the federal contribution to public health laboratories. GAO (2001b) reported that the nation 's laboratories and other parts of the infectious disease surveillance system were not well prepared to detector respond to a bioterrorist attack because of reductions in laboratorystaffing and training that have affected the ability of state and local authori-ties to identify biological agents. The limitations of existing laboratorycapacity were clearly demonstrated by the 1999 outbreak of West Nilevirus in New York State. Even with a relatively small outbreak in an areaserved by one of the nation 's largest local public health agencies, the inves- tigations taxed federal, state, and local laboratory resources (GAO, 2001b).Both New York State and CDC laboratories were inundated with requestsfor testing, and CDC had to process the bulk of the testing because of thelimited capacity of the New York State laboratories. Federal officials indi-cated that if another outbreak had occurred simultaneously, CDC wouldnot have been able to respond (GAO, 2001b). Many public health laboratories are unable to keep pace with the moni- toring and tracking of infectious agents that are already known in commu-nities. Some states do not routinely test for important infectious diseases.For example, although most states conducted surveillance for tuberculosis,Escherichia coli O157:H7, pertussis, and cryptosporidiosis, fewer than half of state laboratories tested for penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and hepatitis C (GAO, 1999a). Nearly half of the state public health labo-ratories lacked access to advanced molecular detection systems and othertechnologies for identifying specific strains of pathogens, information thatis valuable to epidemiological investigations to trace the sources of diseaseoutbreaks. Many state public health directors and epidemiologists report that in- adequate staffing and information-sharing problems hinder their ability togenerate and use laboratory data for surveillance (GAO, 1999a). A recentstudy conducted by APHL (2002b) raised concerns about the public healthlaboratory workforce. The study found that the country is facing an immi-nent shortage of qualified public health laboratory directors. APHL antici-pates 13 vacancies over the next 5 years in state public health laboratorydirectorships, with a replacement pool that current laboratory directorsdescribe as either inadequate or marginally adequate in size to meet futuredemands (APHL, 2002b). Moreover, inadequate laboratory staffing is aproblem. Although there is great variability in laboratory staffing amongthe states, states devoted a median of 8 staff per 1 million population tolaboratory testing of infectious diseases 11 (GAO, 1999b). Additionally, 11 Individual states reported a range from 1.4 to 89 staff per 1 million population.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE 139 according to the American Society for Clinical Pathology, the United States faces a serious shortage of medical laboratory personnel (ASCP, 2000). Instate or local laboratories that have few personnel trained to handle thecomplexity and volume of work associated with bioterrorism scares (e.g.,anthrax), there is little capacity to sustain states of \"alert\" for days or weeks (APHL, 2002b). Efforts are under way to modernize the manner in which laboratory information is recorded and communicated; these efforts emphasize the useof automated, electronic systems (CDC, 1999). A 1997 meeting of CDC,CSTE, and APHL to design strategies for implementing effective electroniclaboratory-based reporting produced a recommendation to base such strat-egies on the use of Health Level 7 (HL -7), a national standard for commu- nicating clinical health information (CDC, 1997). Other issues discussed ata 1999 meeting included modes of data transmission, data privacy, soft-ware development, data quality, data flow, and recommendations concern-ing leadership and coordination, software tools and technical support,policy development, training and education, and public -private collabora- tions (CDC, 1999). In 2001, the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) and the Working Group on Bioterrorism Preparedness 12 esti- mated that approximately $200 million was needed as an initial investmentto improve state and local preparedness with regard to laboratory capacity.This funding would support Further development and implementation of the Laboratory Re- sponse Network, which is a multilevel laboratory network composed offederal, state, county, and city public health laboratories designed to receiveand analyze specimens from a range of sources; Full implementation of the National Laboratory System, which is a communications system designed to rapidly share laboratory informationamong public health, hospital, and commercial laboratories; Integration of chemical terrorism preparedness into laboratory im- provements; and Improved diagnostic testing and identification of potential agents of bioterrorism by animal and wildlife laboratories and improved commu-nications among human, animal, and wildlife laboratories. 12 CIDRAP was established in September 2001 with the mission of (1) supporting the development of and refining public policies relating to the prevention, control, and treatment of infectious diseases to ensure that they reflect the most current biomedical knowledge, and(2) promoting practices among both health care professionals and the public that aim to reduce illness and death from infectious diseases through provision of accurate, up-to-date information and education.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html140 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH CDC has initiated a program to develop a cohesive national laboratory system to ensure disease surveillance and the capacity for effective response(CDC, 2001c). Under this initiative, the proposed National System forLaboratory Testing for Public Health seeks to ensure the availability of aconsistent public health laboratory capacity (CDC, 2001c). A report on theFY 2002 bioterrorism-related appropriations provided for infrastructureimprovements. In FY 2000, CDC awarded approximately $11 million to 48 states and four major urban health departments to improve and upgradetheir surveillance and epidemiological capabilities (GAO, 2001b). Morerecently (2002), bioterrorism-related federal funds ($1 billion) designatedto help prepare state infrastructures for bioterrorism and other emergencieshave begun to flow to states (http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2002pres/20020131b.html). The bulk of funds designated for laboratory capacitybuilding (about $40 million) will go to enhance CDC 's intramural labora- tory capacity. State public health laboratories, assisted by CDC, are working to de- ploy more sophisticated laboratory equipment that can help identify sus-pected bioterrorism attacks quickly and precisely. In addition, CDC is work-ing to validate the use of molecular DNA and antibody tests in potentialcases of bioterrorism; setting uniform guidelines for the use of faster, moresensitive instruments; and planning to supply state public health laborato-ries with identical kits of biological reagents necessary to identifybioterrorism agents. The efforts aim to improve confidence in test resultsand guarantee that the results can be verified quickly at other laboratories(Hamilton, 2001). Given the important role of public health laboratories in assuring the health of the population and in protecting the nation 's security, the com- mittee believes that federal, state, and local public health agencies shouldhave access to a strong, state-of-the-art public health laboratory system.Furthermore, the committee believes that these public health laboratoriesare an essential part of a robust and stable surveillance capability necessaryto identify emerging threats, natural or intentional, to the health of thepublic and to track the effectiveness of interventions at multiple levels. In addition to the overall assessment of the public health system, the committee recommends that DHHS evaluate the status of the nation's pub-lic health laboratory system, including an assessment of the impact of re-cent increased funding. The evaluation should identify remaining gaps, andfunding should be allocated to close them. Working with the states, DHHSshould agree on a base funding level that will maintain the enhanced labo-ratory system and allow the rapid deployment of newly developed tech-nologies.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Even before the events of 2001,the threat of chemical terrorism hadgrown more real in the United Statesbecause of developments in the mid-1990s such as the discovery of the Iraqibiological weapons program and therelease of sarin nerve gas in the Tokyosubway by the Aum Shinrikyo cult(Henderson, 1998). Resources put into the improvement of the public healthsystem 's ability to respond to bioterrorism will yield benefits that go far beyond that specific concern, but only if adequate funds are made availableto strengthen the public health infrastructure 's ability to detect and combat natural disease outbreaks, such as E. coli and other food-borne pathogens, and to work with other vital partners in the public health system to providethe protection necessary for the assurance of public health. Readiness of Local Public Health Agencies Until recently, the degree to which public health departments were actually prepared for bioterrorist attacks or other emergencies was un-known. Determining the level of state and local health departments ' emer- gency preparedness and response capacities is crucial because public healthofficials are among those, along with firefighters, emergency medical per-sonnel, and local law enforcement personnel, who serve on \"rapid re- sponse \" teams when large-scale emergency situations arise. These health department officials must work closely with federal public health agenciessuch as CDC and, occasionally, law enforcement agencies (e.g., the FBI andthe Department of Justice) to investigate and resolve the various threats tothe community 's health, regardless of whether the threat is natural in origin (e.g., floods, tornadoes, and earthquakes) or intentional (e.g., bioterroristattacks). Two weeks following the attacks on September 11, 2001, NACCHO (2001a) conducted a brief survey to understand the impacts of the events onlocal health departments and to assess how well those health departmentsWith our public health infrastruc- ture in its current shape, trying to detect and respond to a bioterror- ism attack is comparable to run- ning O 'Hare Airport 's air traffic control system with tin cans and string.

Of theinquiries received by local health officials, most concerned vaccination andthe availability of medicines. Other inquiries focused on the degree to whichthe local community was prepared and what the local public health agencywas doing to prepare the community. An alarming finding was the extent to which the local public health agencies themselves were unprepared for bioterrorist attacks. Of those whoresponded, only 20 percent indicated that their agency had a comprehen-sive response plan. Most of the respondents, 56 percent, indicated that theiragency 's response plan was still under development, and 24 percent indi- cated that their agency had no plan at all (NACCHO, 2001a). Healthofficials themselves were also unprepared. When asked how prepared theyfelt to respond to concerned citizens ' inquiries, only 38 percent of health officials stated that they were \"pretty well prepared \" to respond, whereas another 50 percent of respondents indicated that they were only \"some- what prepared. \" The remaining respondents (12 percent) felt that they were \"not prepared at all \" (NACCHO, 2001a). Survey respondents also reported on the frustrations that they encoun- tered during that time of crisis. For example, the main frustration voicedwas the lack or malfunctioning of resources and equipment, including nec-essary communications tools such as pagers, cell phones, e-mail, and faxes.The second most common frustration was the partial or total lack of com-munication from federal and state agencies, which was often interpreted asa sign of poor leadership. In fact, some health officials indicated that theyhad to rely on the news media rather than on local disaster response agen-cies, state public health departments, or federal agencies to be alerted toand receive updates about the September 11 crisis (NACCHO, 2001a).Other state and local public health officials noted that during the subse-quent anthrax outbreaks, staff attention to other public health activitieswas diverted to responding to the public 's concerns and questions, not to mention the investigation of false anthrax reports (California Bay AreaHealth Officials, personal communication, 2001).The public health system is the vital link in our ability to preserve and protect human life when disaster strikes.

All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE 143 Improving Preparedness The data from the NACCHO survey paint a disquieting picture of the preparedness of the nation 's local health departments and thus the height- ened vulnerability of communities. This is hardly surprising news, however,given that state and local public health agencies have been underfunded andunderstaffed for decades and have less \"surge capacity or potential \" (i.e., the ability to respond to a sudden influx of demand) than hospitals (Centerfor Civilian Biodefense Studies, 2001). Several efforts to improve readinessare under way. In 1999, DHHS created the Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Initiative, which is aimed at upgrading the nation 's public health capacity to respond to bioterrorism and to establish a formal Bioterrorism Prepared-ness and Response Program. 13 So far the accomplishments that have been under this initiative include creation of a National Pharmaceutical Stock-pile Program and operationalization of the Rapid Response and AdvancedTechnology Laboratory, which is able to identify rapidly biological andchemical agents rarely seen in the United States (CDC, 2001a). The development of a nationwide, integrated information, communica- tion, and training network (of which the Health Alert Network, NEDSS,and Epi-X should be a part), as recommended by the National Committeeon Vital and Health Statistics, will also help strengthen the ability of fed-eral, state, and local public health agencies to share information (CDC,2001a). External communications systems also must be strengthened toensure the rapid and effective transfer of information and communicationbetween public health agencies and other frontline emergency responders,including health care providers, law enforcement and emergency responsepersonnel, and government officials (CDC, 2000a). The importance of ef-fective communication in times of crisis cannot be overstated (ASTHO,2001c). The Columbia University School of Nursing Center for Health Policy is a CDC-supported project that has specified the competencies in emergencyresponse needed by all public health workers (Columbia Center for HealthPolicy, 2001). These individual competencies are complementary to theorganizational capacities for bioterrorism response developed by CDC(2001b), the standards for state and local public health performance (CDC, 13 At the time that this report was drafted, legislation for a Department of Homeland Security was under debate. The legislation proposes a \"single focal point \" for managing and overseeing security functions across Congress, federal departments and agencies, state govern-ments, and local governments. Such a department undoubtedly will have direct and indirect implications for governmental public health agencies. However, the evolving nature of this process led the committee not to include a discussion of this work in progress.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

It is also vital that health care providers and facilities acknowledge their important role as part of the larger system that assures population health,both in general and in times of crisis. Because frontline health care provid-ers (i.e., those in urgent care and emergency room facilities) are often thefirst to see unusual illnesses or injuries, they must constantly be vigilant tonotice trends that seem out of the ordinary and must report these trends tolocal public health departments (ASTHO, 1999; CDC, 2000a). Once suchobservations are reported, public health investigators can provide appropri-ate follow-up through epidemiological investigations. Investing in Infrastructure Improvements If the United States is going to be appropriately prepared for a terrorist attack (biological, chemical, or otherwise), one of the top priorities must beto strengthen the public health infrastructure at all levels so that it is strongenough, flexible enough, and capable enough to respond to emergencysituations of this nature (CDC, 2000a). An estimated initial investment of approximately $400 million is needed to improve state and local preparedness with regard to personnel, training,epidemiology, and surveillance capacity (Center for Infectious Disease Re-search and Policy and Workgroup on Bioterrorism Preparedness, 2001).This level of investment would cover the integration of bioterrorism pre-paredness activities into existing communicable disease prevention and con-trol programs such as CDC 's emerging infections program, the training of public health practitioners, and the hiring of designated public health vet-erinarians for states that do not have one. An estimated additional $200million was also recommended to begin to improve state and local pre-paredness with regard to information and communication systems (e.g.,Health Alert Network, NEDSS, Epi-X, and rapid communication systems).It was also noted that additional funds would be needed to sustain thesesystems effectively over time. Progress toward these estimated needs has been addressed by some of the new resources for infrastructure improvement made available throughbioterrorism-related appropriations. A report on the FY 2002 appropria-tions makes reference to infrastructure improvements such as those autho-rized by the Public Health Improvement Act of 2000 (P.L. 106 -505). Fur- thermore, in 2002, Congress authorized a variety of bioterrorism-relatedactivities in the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness andResponse Act of 2002 (OMB, 2002) (see Table 3 -1). Following the passage of the Public Health Threats and Emergency Act of 2000, there were plans to develop two separate grant programs \u2014one forCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

These were subsequently combined with a stronger emphasis on spe-cific preparation for bioterrorism and other such emergencies.

The bulk of the funding was for the Health Alert Network; and smaller amounts wereallocated for public health laboratory infrastructure and other needs, suchas staff development and epidemiology and detection systems. For FY 2002,and prior to September 11, 2001, states were to receive $75 million; how-ever, this amount was supplemented with $915 million. The followingseven \"capacity areas \" (along with the estimated funding levels), deemed necessary for bioterrorism preparedness, were identified for allocation ofthese funds: 1. Preparedness planning and readiness assessment ($183 million, in- cluding $65 million for the pharmaceutical stockpile) 2. Surveillance and epidemiology capacity ($183 million)3. Laboratory capacity, biological agents ($118.9 million)4. Laboratory capacity, chemical agents ($0)5. Health Alert Network/communication and information technology ($109.8 million) 6. Communicating health risks and health information dissemination ($46.7 million) 7. Education and training ($91.5 million) The total represents about 42 percent of CDC 's total appropriations for bioterrorism and emergency preparedness. Although the overall resources for the improvement of state and local public health department capacities have increased substantially becauseof these allocations, it should be noted that the local public health infra- structure provides other importantfunctions that are not covered by theimprovements made as a result of theseappropriations (e.g., reasons, it is impor-tant to ensure that the improvementsthat will be made to state and localinfrastructures are based on compre-hensive data about what is needed toensure the delivery of the 10 essential public health services at the community level.

FINANCING THE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE State and local governments traditionally have had financial responsi- bility for basic governmental public health services, such as workforcetraining, the development of information systems and the organizationalcapacity to conduct disease surveillance and prevention programs, the man-agement of public health laboratories, the implementation of population-based prevention and health education programs, and other protectionssuch as water and air quality management, waste disposal, and pest con-trol. Yet the federal government also has a financial responsibility for assur-ing the capacity of the public health infrastructure at the state and locallevels. Unlike the areas of medical care and biomedical research, however,the federal government has never made a similar level of investment in thepublic health infrastructure, such as the clinical laboratories, surveillancesystems, or environmental monitoring systems needed to monitor healthand health threats at the state and community levels. In the past, in re-sponse to perceptions of great national need, substantial federal invest-ments played a crucial role in the development of the hospital industry andof the biomedical research capacity as well as the expansions of medicalschools. What a national government pays for is a critical statement aboutpriorities. Assessing Infrastructure Costs and the Need for Federal Investment As the committee has noted, there are vast differences across the coun- try in the scope of activities, the resources available, and the organization ofthe governmental public health infrastructure at the state and local levelsand in the sizes of the populations served. This complicates the task ofassessing the cost of public health services and the appropriate investmentin the governmental infrastructure that delivers these services or ensuresthat they are provided. In 1997, the DHHS Office of the Assistant Secretaryfor Planning and Evaluation commissioned the Lewin Group 14 to develop a 14 The Lewin Group is a health and human services consulting firm whose activities include advising public, private, and nonprofit sectors to improve policy, manage and evaluate pro- grams, and maximize performance as well as other issues.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The report urged a collective effort with ASTHO,NACCHO, and PHF to study the status of the public health infrastructureand respond with a sustained investment plan to address the needs identi-fied (The Lewin Group, 1997). Assessing the funds and expenditures for the public health infrastruc- ture at the local level is complex. Data from NACCHO (2001d) illustratesome of this complexity. The average annual expenditure of the 630 localpublic health agencies reporting was $4.5 million (1999 dollars), but 50percent of these agencies had expenditures of $621,000 or less. By contrast,25 percent of the agencies serving large populations of 500,000 or morehad annual expenditures of more than $46 million. On average, local pub-lic health agencies reported receiving 44 percent of their funding from localgovernment, 30 percent from state government (including funds passedthrough federal programs), 19 percent from reimbursements for services, 3percent from the federal government, and 4 percent from other sources. ASTHO, NACCHO, the National Association of Local Boards of Health (NALBOH), and PHF, in various collaborative efforts supported byDHHS, have been exploring ways to measure actual expenditures at thestate and local levels for each of the 10 essential public health services(Barry et al., 1998; Public Health Foundation, 2000). Feasibility studiesshow promise, but no systematic accounting of this sort is being done on aregular basis. Almost no data are available on how much would be needed to ad- equately build and sustain the necessary public health infrastructure tosupport the nationwide provision of the essential public health services atthe local level. One jurisdiction \u2014Bergen County, New Jersey \u2014conducted a detailed analysis of the funding needed for the public health infrastructureto be able to meet new state public health practice standards. Its estimate of$5.1 million per year translates into about $6.61 per capita and representsthe county 's best current judgment of the total, ongoing investment in infrastructure required to support the provision of the 10 essential publichealth services throughout the county (National Partnership for Social En-terprise, 2002). Various IOM reports (IOM, 1988, 1992, 1997a, 1997b,2000a) have made a case for sustained action, both domestically and inter-nationally, to strengthen the public health infrastructure. A detailed exami-nation of infrastructure needs specifically in support of the nation 's immu- nization system produced a recommendation for annual federal funding of$200 million for the next 5 years, along with an overall increase in fundingfrom state governments of $100 million (IOM, 2000b). That report alsoemphasized the importance of stability in infrastructure funding, docu-menting the adverse impact at the state and local levels of rapid increasesfollowed by rapid decreases in federal funding during the 1990s.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Congress responded to the national measles outbreak in 1989 -1991, in part, by increasing funding for state immunization infrastructure grantsfrom $37 million in 1990 to $261 million in 1995, but the appropriationswere reduced by about $80 million in 1996 and had fallen to $111 millionby 1999. A variety of barriers (e.g., the requirements of state budget cyclesand the administrative constraints of a 1-year grant period) had made itdifficult for states to absorb the initial influx of grant funds, but fundingwas cut just as states had begun to build program capacity (IOM, 2000b).Moreover, the influx of federal funding had led state legislatures to cut statefunding for infrastructure activities (Freed et al., 2000). Both stable andsustained funding is needed for the effective performance of the publichealth infrastructure. On the basis of available data, the committee was unable to conclude what level of federal funding may be warranted as an ongoing, governmen-tal investment in the development and maintenance of the public healthinfrastructure to ensure that it can provide the essential public health ser-vices to all Americans. It is expected that funding for the Public HealthImprovement Act of 2000 will enhance the public health infrastructure, butit is unclear to what extent these additional investments would furtherimprove the ability of the public health infrastructure to meet its broad day-to-day responsibilities for protecting and improving the health of the popu-lation. A commitment for sustained public health infrastructure financing(unrelated to bioterrorism-related activities) is clearly needed. Prior efforts at systematic nationwide studies of financing for public health have failed because of their exclusive focus on the budgets of stateand local governmental public health agencies rather than the funding ofthe public health system, thus preventing appropriate benchmarking forcommunities that have various approaches to the allocation of roles andresponsibilities within the system. For example, in the late 1960s, Con-gress became increasingly aware of the need for accountability pertainingto state expenditures and performance as the amount of funding allocatedto state health departments was increasing under Section 314(d) of thePublic Health Service Act. As a result, the PHS agencies allocated funds tocreate the National Public Health Program Reporting System (NPHPRS).Started in 1970 and operated by the Public Health Foundation, all statesroutinely participated in this voluntary reporting system. Data were col-lected and verified for items such as federal and nonfederal expendituresby program areas, the organizational structures of health departments,and revenue amounts and sources. This was the only data source of thisCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

While discussions were occurring around health care reform in the early 1990s, PHF worked with state and local public healthagencies to improve NPHPRS, using the Healthy People 2000 objectives as the basis for performance measures and the 10 essential services as theframework for collecting expenditure data. In 1995, PHS discontinuedfunding because NPHPRS could not provide program management datafor federal agencies. Nearly a decade later, no reporting system exists andno data on state public health expenditures and programs are available.Although different methods of categorizing and cataloging expenditureshave been studied, the research indicates that use of the 10 essentialpublic health services for collection of expenditure data is feasible, reli-able, and beneficial to the public health community. In addition, theNational Public Health Performance Standards Program 's Local Public Health System Performance Assessment Instrument appears to be effec-tive in assessing the capabilities of local public health agencies to provideessential public health services. There is still a great need for an expenditure reporting system for public health agencies based on the framework of the essential public health ser-vices and consistent with the newly implemented National Public HealthPerformance Standards Program to produce a needs assessment and expen-ditures data as a basis for estimating the investments needed. To begin thisprocess, the committee recommends that DHHS be accountable for assess- ing the state of the nation 's governmental public health infrastructure and its capacity to provide the essential public health services to every commu-nity and for reporting that assessment annually to Congress and the nation.The assessment should include a thorough evaluation of federal, state, andlocal funding for the nation 's governmental public health infrastructure and should be conducted in collaboration with state and local officials. Theassessment should identify strengths and gaps and serve as the basis forplans to develop a funding and technical assistance plan to assuresustainability. The public availability of these reports will enable state andlocal public health agencies to use them for continual self-assessment andevaluation. Organizational Impact of Federal Grant Funding The ways in which funds are transmitted have an impact on program effectiveness. At present, most discretionary funding distributed by DHHSto states and some local entities is allocated through block grants, formulagrants, and categorical programs. According to the White House 's Blue- print for New Beginnings accompanying the FY 2002 budget, DHHS man-ages hundreds of discrete public health activities. For these activities, statesreceive about $4 billion in formula grants and about $3 billion throughCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE 151 block grants. The Blueprint for New Beginnings (White House, 2001) notes that potential reform of formula and block grant programs is a priority ofthe administration. The administration is considering increasing state flex-ibility to address public health needs through expanded transfer authoritiesand other mechanisms to remove barriers to effective targeting of publichealth resources at the state and local levels. The Blueprint does not addressthe need to increase the flexibility of categorical grants. Formula grants are characterized by the allocation of funds to states in accordance with a distribution formula prescribed by law or administrativeregulation. Two examples of formula grants can be found under Title I andTitle II of the Ryan White CARE Act. Formula-driven grants have beendifficult to modify on the basis of new variables influencing a particularissue or changes in the demographics of affected populations. The politicalprocess often prevents formula revisions that would negatively affect sig-nificant numbers of states, even if the expressed purposes of funding wouldbe better realized by shifts to more needy populations or to other geo-graphic areas. Block grant programs are a subset of formula allocation programs in which the recipient has broad discretion in the application of funds receivedin support of broad program areas (e.g., Prevention and Treatment ofSubstance Abuse and Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grants).Block grant programs have various reporting requirements. One of the questions that has been long asked is about the effectiveness of the block grant mechanism in targeting funding to a particular purposeor need. Michael Rich (1993) conducted highly regarded studies of thisissue, in the area of funding for the poor. After significant empirical analysisof the distribution of Community Development Block Grants, he drewseveral broad conclusions about this funding vehicle: State and local officials play an important role in determining the degree to which federal grants are used to balance income and resources inresource-poor areas. The capacity and will of governments to target federal grant funds to the poor vary widely. Government officials tend to spread benefits widelyas opposed to concentrating them where the need is the greatest. Strong coalitions are more effective in influencing federal program decisions, including targeting areas of greatest need. However, local coali-tions need a strong federal partner to make explicit targeting more accept-able locally. A literature review of different models for federal funding conducted by the DHHS Office of the Inspector General in 1994 noted that states reportCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html152 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH that block grants increased administrative efficiency and integration and did not replace state funds. Categorical grants provide states and other recipients with funding for specific programs. CDC provides a significant amount of funding to stategovernment departments of health through categorical grants (e.g., for HIV/AIDS prevention, sexually transmitted disease control, tuberculosis control,and chronic disease). They are highly restrictive in terms of how the recipi-ents may use the funding, may add administrative costs and complexities,and may worsen fragmented program management and service delivery, asfederal prohibitions against mixing funds create programmatic \"stove- pipes. \" The result can be separation and gaps in services, because even related program areas become insulated and isolated from each other andlack the flexibility to respond to changes at the recipient level. Furthermore,measuring their real effectiveness has been difficult at times because of thelarge number of individual grants and the lack of resources for effectiveperformance monitoring (Boufford and Lee, 2001). The DHHS Performance Partnership initiative and the Oregon Option are examples of efforts to use a more performance-oriented approach tocategorical funding by integrating multiple categorical programs under largerumbrella categories. Under the Performance Partnership initiative, DHHSand its partners worked together to reach consensus on the results to beachieved by the program and develop performance measures to monitorprogress toward the stated results. The Oregon Option tested the proposi-tion that multiple levels of government can align their efforts to achieveresults that matter to people. Both initiatives involved signing memoranda ofunderstanding (MOU) that committed them to work cooperatively to bothdetermine the results to be achieved and to get the job done. The question ofcreating linkages of funding to benefit coalitions demands another role forgovernments in partnering with key local stakeholders. This situation should be remedied. Expanded transfer authorities and other mechanisms to remove barriers and facilitate, rather than hinder, thealignment of resources and policy for the actualization of national healthobjectives should be considered. Thus, the committee recommends that the federal government and states renew efforts to experiment with clusteringor consolidation of categorical grants for the purpose of increasing localflexibility to address priority health concerns and enhance the efficient useof limited resources. Financial Implications of a Changing Mission for Governmental Public Health Agencies in Providing Health Care Services Essential public health service number 7 (see Box 3 -1) charges state and local governmental public health agencies to \"link people to neededCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Thus, state and local governmental public health agencies are responsiblefor providing a safety net to guarantee that personal health care services areavailable to all members of the communities they serve. As noted earlier,since 1988, state and local governments have turned increasingly to theprivate sector, particularly managed care organizations, to provide healthcare services for Medicaid beneficiaries and others, many of whom wereonce served directly by local public health departments. In addition, anincreasing number of employees (approximately 85 percent) (Kuttner, 1999)are covered by private health insurance, reducing their need for servicesfrom public health departments. These changes seemed to provide greatpromise that local public health agencies would be able to shift their focusfrom the provision of personal health care services to previously neglectedpopulation-based public health functions (IOM, 1996). In some states andcommunities, however, services to Medicaid patients had offered an impor-tant revenue stream that subsidized the population health programs ofgovernmental public health agencies (Keane et al., 2001). Thus, these agencies find themselves in a difficult relationship with managed care plans: on the one hand, encouraging their active partnershipin the public health system, while, on the other, competing with them forrevenues for some of these services (Lumpkin et al., 1998). A study of statepublic health agencies found that 16 of 47 states had some kind of collabo-ration between their public health departments and managed care groups(DHHS, 1999). In most cases, the managed care organizations were con-tracted to provide direct patient care (e.g., primary care and clinical preven-tive services). Other studies of this collaboration reported similar findings. Although there is great potential benefit from collaborations between public health agencies and managed care plans, current economic trends formanaged care programs are not optimistic. In 1997, 67 percent of managedcare plans sponsored by safety-net providers lost money, and only 8 percentindicated that they broke even (Gray and Rowe, 2000). In recent years,managed care organizations have been withdrawing from collaborativecontracts with governmental public health agencies, once again leavingthese agencies with the pressure of having to deliver personal health careservices including primary care services to the uninsured or vulnerablepopulations rejected by the medical care system. This instability in servicedelivery is also contributing to the disruption of individuals ' continuity and availability of care (IOM, 2000a). Of potential assistance to safety-net providers is the reemerging interest in federal support for \"a doubling \" of community health centers, operated either by traditional governmental public health agencies or by nongovern-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Congress recently awarded DHHS with funding to add 1,200 new and expanded health center sites over a 5-year period. Atthe end of 2002, DHHS will have invested $165 million in 260 new andexpanded health centers capable of serving an additional 1.25 million people(HRSA, 2002). As these centers redevelop, the lessons of the past must bekept in mind. The allocation of federal and state resources to communitiesfor these facilities and other health-related programs should be coordinatedin a process that ensures the involvement and approval (or at least acknowl-edgment) of local public health agencies. Moreover, coordination with stateand local public health authorities and other community resources is essen-tial (IOM, 1988). The committee finds that, as in 1988, the continued lack of a nation- wide strategy to ensure adequate financing of personal medical, preventive,and health promotion services will continue to place undue burdens on thepublic health system and to fragment the provision of personal health careservices to those most in need of comprehensive integrated approaches.Also, if the number of uninsured continues to increase, the diversion ofresources urgently needed for population health efforts to the health careassurance component of the governmental public health system may berequired. The recent downturn in in-state revenues due to the national economic slump will exacerbate problems of sustaining the state share of Medicaidfunding and lessen the likelihood of increased or, perhaps, even sustainedstate funding for the governmental public health infrastructure. Improving the Operation and Management of the Governmental Public Health Infrastructure Successfully implementing health policy based on multiple determi- nants of health and their impact on the health of communities and popula-tions will depend on the effective performance of public health agencies atall levels of government. The committee has discussed the need to strengthenspecific aspects of the governmental public health infrastructure at thefederal, state, and local levels \u2014the competency of the workforce, the inte- gration and enhancement of information and communication networks,and the improvement of the laboratory and organizational capacities toensure that the essential public health functions are available to all Ameri-cans. Another important priority is to improve the management and coor-dination of the work of public health agencies as they support this goal ofprotecting and improving the health of the population.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The Na-tional Public Health Performance Standards Program (NPHPSP), initiatedin 1998, is an effort to use the ideas of performance measurement to pro-mote the organization of state and local public health practice arounddelivery of the essential public health services (see Box 3 -4). In a national partnership, CDC, ASTHO, NACCHO, NALBOH, APHA, and PHF are working together to establish measurable performancestandards for state and local public health systems, to develop tools toassess performance against these standards, and to create incentives forstates and localities to use such tools. Some of these measures could be usedin a \"report card \" or as standards in a national program that accredits public health agencies. The performance standards effort is seen as one way to help move the state and local components of the nation 's public health system closer to the system envisioned in The Future of Public Health (IOM, 1988). Separate sets of tools for governance have been developed and tested. The instruments areavailable via CDC 's NPHPSP website (www.phppo.cdc.gov/nphpsp), the ASTHO website for the state instrument theNALBOH website for the governance instrument (www.nalboh.org/perfstds/perfstds.htm) (NALBOH, 2001). Although the program is aimed at assessingthe performance of the public health system as a whole, it recognizes thatgovernmental public health agencies have key responsibilities for leading,coordinating, and supporting the efforts of various contributors. The interest in measuring the performance of the public health system extends to the possibility of establishing a formal process of accreditation tocertify that governmental public health agencies are meeting specified levelsof performance. Several states have developed or are developing state-specificperformance requirements for local governmental public health agencies, butinterest has also emerged in the development of nationally standardized,systematic performance evaluations for state and local public health agencies. No agreement has been reached on the appropriate criteria or process for accreditation. One of the key challenges is to create a system that isflexible enough to accommodate the wide variety of public health depart-ment structures and circumstances across states. Given the resource con-straints that state and local governmental public health agencies currentlyface, it is unclear how performance standards can be met or accreditationCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html156 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH BOX 3 -4 The National Public Health Performance Standards Program Started in 1998, the National Public Health Performance Standards Program (NPHPSP) is a collaborative effort between the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC) and a variety of national organizations representing state and local public health agencies and other elements of the public health community: the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO), Ameri-can Public Health Association, Association of State and Territorial Health Offi- cials, National Association of Local Boards of Health, and Public Health Founda- tion (Halverson et al., 1998; NACCHO, 2001a). Designed to measure publichealth practices at the state and local levels, the mission of NPHPSP is to im- prove quality and performance, increase accountability, and increase the sci- ence base for public health practice. The performance standards are based on the 10 essential public health services, and for each essential service there are model standards (descriptions of and condi- tions for optimum performance of the public health system) and measures (multiple-choice questions that address components of the model standard). The measure- ment instruments concentrate on three aspects of the public health system: 1. State-level measures that focus on the state-level public health system and on the agencies and partners that contribute to population health at the state level; 2. Local-level measures that focus on the local public health system and on the entities that contribute to public health within a community; and 3. Governance measures that focus on the governing body or bodies that are ultimately accountable for public health at the local level (including boards of health or county commissioners). The development of a local-level instrument began in 1998. Since then, the instrument has been tested in local public health agencies throughout Florida, Hawaii, Minnesota, Mississippi, New York, Ohio, and Texas. This testing en-sures that the instrument is responsive to the needs of communities, accu- rately assesses local performance and capacities, and addresses the broad variation in local public health infrastructures across the nation (NACCHO,2001f). Recent pilot testing of the NPHPSP instruments indicates that the per- formance standards based on the 10 essential services have validity for mea- suring local public health performance (Beaulieu and Scutchfield, 2002). Thelocal instruments were developed by the same NACCHO -CDC partnership that developed the community-wide strategic planning tool for improving com- munity health, Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships(MAPP), as part of the Assessment Protocol for Excellence in Public Health project. The local instrument will be included in the new MAPP tool as a meth- od for assessing the local public health system and identifying areas ofimprovement.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE 157 can be achieved when the resources to provide even the most basic services are often lacking. Linking federal funding to accreditation based on publichealth performance standards has been proposed, but there may not beadequate incentives for states and localities that do not receive significantportions of their overall funding from federal agencies. The promise of along-term federal investment at the state and local levels linked to such asystem could change the situation considerably. To address these and other concerns, NACCHO has convened the Voluntary Accreditation Committee, which consists of eight local healthofficers who are charged with maintaining an ongoing discussion of theadvantages and disadvantages of voluntary accreditation of local healthdepartments. They are currently researching lessons that might be learnedfrom other voluntary accreditation efforts, such as those for hospitals,managed care organizations, and law enforcement agencies. The VoluntaryAccreditation Committee is also taking into account the work of states suchas Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, and Washington that arealready active in the development of state-specific accreditation or perfor-mance standards for their local public health agencies. Despite the controversies concerning accreditation, the committee be- lieves that greater accountability is needed on the part of state and localpublic health agencies with regard to the performance of the core publichealth functions of assessment, assurance, and policy development and theessential public health services. Furthermore, the committee believes thatdevelopment of a uniform set of national standards leading to public healthagency accreditation could provide such a mechanism, but only if adher-ence to such standards is linked to a commitment of sustained federalinvestment in the state and local public health infrastructure to assure thatresources are available. Moreover, such a mechanism could serve to in-crease levels of accountability among state and local elected officials inwhose jurisdictions these agencies operate. The breakthrough concepts ofNPHPSP provide a way to conceptualize the system as the unit of accredi-tation and, from there, to evaluate the role of the agencies in facilitating thework of the system. Accreditation is a useful tool for improving the quality of services provided to the public by setting standards and evaluating performanceagainst those standards. Accreditation mechanisms have helped to ensurethe robustness of the health care delivery system (hospitals, clinics, pro-grams) and medical and other educational programs. Accreditation pro-cesses also provide information to the public about the quality of the ser-vices they receive (e.g., National Committee for Quality Assurance reportcards on health plans) (IOM, 2001). Governmental public health agenciescurrently have no such framework, and the communities they serve havelittle information on the quality of the services they receive. An accredita-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Therefore, the committee recommends that the Secretary of DHHS appoint a nationalcommission to consider if an accreditation system would be useful forimproving and building state and local public health agency capacities. Ifsuch a system is deemed useful, the commission should make recommenda-tions on how it would be governed and develop mechanisms (e.g., incen-tives) to gain state and local government participation in the accreditationeffort. Membership on this commission should include representatives fromCDC, ASTHO, NACCHO, and nongovernmental organizations. This commission should focus on the development of a system that will further the efforts of NPHPSP. The work of this commission should beclosely linked to that of the commission whose creation the committee hasrecommended to examine issues related to the credentialing of public healthworkers, because it is conceivable that these mechanisms could be linked. Inboth efforts, the relationship of the official public health agency to its rolein the larger public health system will be key to accreditation. Special Concerns About the Capacity to Meet Local Public Health Needs In The Future of Public Health (1988), the IOM committee concluded that \"no community, no matter how small or remote, should be without identifiable and realistic access to the benefits of public health protection, which is possible only through a localcomponent of the public health deliverysystem \" (IOM, 1988: 144). The ratio- nale behind this finding is clear: If acommunity is going to be able to meetits own health needs, it must have ac-cess to an identifiable public health in-frastructure to provide the essentialpublic health services. Today, concernsremain about the availability of an ad-equate local public health infrastruc- ture, particularly in terms of staffing and communications systems, to pro-vide these services. Despite the presence of some 3,000 local public health agencies through- out the country, these agencies are not equally distributed across states oracross rural and urban areas. For example, Bergen County, New Jersey,with a population of approximately 884,000 and an area of 234 squaremiles (Census Bureau, 2001a), is served by a strong county health depart-ment, 55 local boards of health, and 22 independent public health agenciesthat serve different and occasionally overlapping communities (T. Milne, Either we are all protected or we are all at risk. Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, Formerly, Centers for Disease Control and PreventionCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

By contrast, the state of Maine, with a population of about 1.3 million distributed over30,862 square miles (Census Bureau, 2001b), has two local public healthagencies (T. Milne, NACCHO, personal communication, October 31,2001). Challenges come from both an abundance of local public healthagencies and their scarcity. When multiple public health departments servethe same geographic area, they may experience difficulties coordinatingactivities and aligning priorities. However, rural areas, with little or nolocal public health presence, may suffer from inadequate public healthcapacity or resources to address local needs and a paucity of educationaland training support (Johnson and Morris, 2000). Data from NACCHO (2001e) also point to substantial differences in the workforce available to local public health agencies. NACCHO 's 1999 - 2000 survey found that 50 percent of all local public health agencies re-sponding had 17 or fewer full-time employees or contract staff, but forthose serving metropolitan areas, 50 percent had at least 28 full-time em-ployees or contract staff. Some local public health agencies, however, cur-rently have only one half-time employee as their entire public health agencystaff. Staffing levels have shown little change over the past decade. A 1997survey found that the median number of full-time employees was 16(NACCHO, 1998), and in 1992 -1993, NACCHO (2001e) reported that 42 percent of local public health agencies had less than 10 full-time staffmembers. Given the many responsibilities and wide-ranging duties inherentin the assurance of population health, the committee is concerned that theselow numbers do not bode well for the core capacity of some local publichealth agencies to provide the 10 essential public health services to theircommunities. Simply increasing the size of the local public health agency workforce appears problematic, however. The committee is concerned about reportsby 68 percent of local public health agencies that budget restrictions pre-vent them from hiring needed staff, including public health nurses, environ-mental specialists, health educators, epidemiologists, and administrativepersonnel (NACCHO, 2001d). In addition, local public health agencies insmaller, nonmetropolitan jurisdictions indicated that they could not hirethe necessary staff because of a lack of qualified candidates in their areasand difficulty attracting other candidates to their locations. Only 19 per-cent of the local public health agencies indicated that they needed new staffbecause of projected expansions of their programs and services (NACCHO,2001d). Many local public health departments also lack even the most basic tools necessary for rapid communication and access to information (GAO,1999b). For example, a 1999 survey of 1,200 local public health depart-ments found that 19 percent did not have the capacity to send and receive e-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The most common barriers cited by the departments without Internet access were prohibitive costs (64 percent), theneed for hardware (64 percent), and the need for staff training (63 percent).Additionally, only 48 percent of the health departments surveyed indicatedthat the director had continuous, high-speed Internet access at work, andonly 44 percent indicated that the department had broadcast fax capabili-ties (Fraser, 1999). In all cases, public health agencies in smaller and moreremote jurisdictions had the least access to information and communica-tions technologies, even though these agencies may actually have the great-est need for such technologies. Given the evidence concerning the local public health workforce and communication capacity as well as related observations made throughoutthis chapter, the committee finds that too little has been done to supportand strengthen the local public health infrastructure. Over the past 14years, governmental public health agencies have made great efforts in re-sponse to the recommendations concerning local public health agencies inThe Future of Public Health (1988) (see Appendix C). Unfortunately, until recently, progress has been slow because of the lack of political and finan-cial support that was needed long ago to fully realize the vision of the 1988report. Recent increases in infrastructure support in connection withbioterrorism preparedness are somewhat encouraging, but there is concernthat such efforts may reinforce the complex problems created by priorcategorical funding if excellent specific services (e.g., surveillance areinformatics) are built on the foundation of a crumbling infrastructure. Forthese reasons, the committee believes that every community, no matter howsmall or remote, should have identifiable and realistic access to the essentialpublic health services, and that it is the responsibility of the states to ensurethat such services are available. However, for states to meet this obligation, the committee recommends that DHHS develop a comprehensive invest-ment plan for a strong governmental national public health infrastructurewith a timetable, clear performance measures, and regular progress reportsto the public. State and local governments should also provide adequate,consistent, and sustainable funding for the governmental public health in-frastructure. This investment is crucial to assure the preparedness of public health departments and the protection of communities, regardless of theirsize or location. Some communities provided comments to the committee noting that a more precise description of an essential minimum level of local officialagency capacity would aid their efforts to obtain public health services. Inan effort to be responsive to these requests, the committee struggled withthe challenge to be more explicit with regard to the level of public healthcapacity that should be present in these small and remote communities. Notsurprisingly, some familiar problems were encountered. For example, thereCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE 161 are questions involving the proper definition of a \"community \" for this purpose and the appropriate response if a community has too small aneconomic base to sustain a formal public health agency with the necessarypresence and capacity to provide public health protections. The most robust approach to assessing need seems to be the use of a functional analysis based on the ability to provide the essential public healthservices, as recommended above. The committee recognizes the potentialvalue of a recommendation regarding the development of a formula todetermine the \"critical mass \" of services and population (e.g., a ratio of one of each of the critical professions per 50,000 or 100,000 population), thegeographic accessibility of services, and the workforce capacity necessaryfor the effective development of local public health agencies to serve smallor remote communities. Before such a recommendation can be made, how-ever, solid, practice-oriented research must be conducted to provide theevidence on which to base a formula or other criteria. The committee had hoped to be able to provide specific guidance to assist the nation in its efforts to rebuild and finance its public health infra-structure. However, a comprehensive search of the published literature andextensive information gathering yielded very little firm, generalizable evi-dence on which to structure public health practice recommendations likethose noted. To remedy this situation, the committee recommends that CDC, in collaboration with the Council on Linkages between Academiaand Public Health Practice and other public health system partners, developa research agenda and estimate the funding needed to build the evidencebase that will guide policy making for public health practice. Strengthening the Management Capacity of DHHS From 1993 to 1997, DHHS, like all federal government departments, conducted a reinvention exercise to determine what work it should do andhow it could do that work more effectively and responsively. A recentmonograph on DHHS and the impact of departmental reinvention effortsin the late 1990s identified two issues of particular significance: (1) theeffect of the balance between centralization and decentralization on themanagement of departmental activities and (2) the relationship of the de-partment with other agencies (Boufford and Lee, 2001). Centralization versus Decentralization: Models for Managing DHHS The committee 's discussion of key federal functions \u2014policy making, financing, infrastructure development, and the like \u2014illustrate how the prob- lems of fragmentation in federal public health activities affect the function-ing of state and local public agencies. Such problems are related to histori-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html162 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH cal patterns and political interests that have shaped federal health struc- tures, but they are not being addressed by the present management struc-ture for health activities in DHHS. The reinvention exercise led to a deci-sion to have each of the PHS agencies report directly to the Secretary ofDHHS rather than to the Assistant Secretary for Health. Potential advan-tages were seen in bringing the agency heads closer to the Secretary andhaving more than a single voice for health at the decision-making table.Boufford and Lee (2001) found that without a formal mechanism for jointpriority setting and routine decision-making across the department, opera-tions became even more decentralized, with staff identifying more withtheir own agencies or programs than with the department as a whole. Theleadership of operating divisions generally prefers to report directly to theSecretary, but division leaders would also welcome a clearly defined struc-ture to formalize coordination, collaboration, and communication amongdepartmental units. Creating a formal mechanism for regular meetings ofthe heads of operating divisions, as well as meetings with the Secretary,would permit more substantive and forward-looking discussion of priori-ties and policies and would address the operational challenges of coordina-tion and communication within the department. Such a forum could alsoprovide better oversight and interaction with cross-departmental groupscreated to address issues identified by the Secretary, such as the Data Coun-cil, the Children 's Council, and the Environmental Health Policy Commit- tee. A defined charter, staff, and timetable for selected cross-cutting activi-ties would strengthen collaboration across units and produce specificrecommendations for action. Recent decisions by DHHS leadership to recentralize public and legisla- tive affairs functions do not address the fundamental issue of policy andprogram coordination. There is also tension within DHHS about the role ofthe regional offices (Boufford and Lee, 2001). Advocates for strong re-gional offices see them as effective vehicles for communicating DHHS pri-orities, learning about local needs and circumstances, and developing ap-propriate responses through the department or by other means. The regionaloffices are also seen as aids in convening state leadership in health andhuman services in those regions and in convening local leaders to help themfind ways to increase their access to federal programs or to collaborate withothers in the public and private sectors to make DHHS programs effective.Although others prefer that DHHS agencies work directly with state andlocal governments and grantees, such agency-by-agency linkages can add tothe fragmentation of efforts to address population health. If regional offices are to become an integral and valuable part of DHHS, they will require managerial attention and resources for significant staffdevelopment or redeployment to obtain the expertise needed in certainprogram areas (Boufford and Lee, 2001).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE 163 Interagency Collaboration Interagency collaboration at the federal level can be difficult because of the specialized nature of agency structures. Every agency has its traditionalrole and expectations for performance, its legislative champions, and itsspecial-interest advocates. According to Bardach (1998), barriers to col-laboration across agency lines are the fact that collaboration tends to bluran agency 's mission and the fact that the agency is politically accountable for pursuing that mission. This historical reality has led to the increasingisolation of cabinet departments and the agencies within those departmentsfrom each other and has created real barriers to the programs within agen-cies that seek to collaborate. This is understandable historically but is clearlydysfunctional in an increasingly complex world where no single agency cando its important work in isolation. This lack of integration is especially evident in the area of health, where health-related programs are already fragmented within DHHS and are widelydistributed across cabinet and subcabinet departments outside DHHS. Forexample, when EPA became an independent agency, it assumed the regula-tory functions of environmental protection, yet the key expertise in the hu-man health effects of environmental hazards remains at DHHS in the Na-tional Center for Environmental Health at CDC, ATSDR, the NationalInstitute of Environmental Health Sciences at NIH, and some parts of FDA. Many agencies not traditionally associated with health issues make policy and manage programs with potential implications for health (seeChapter 2). Greater policy coordination with the Departments of Educa-tion, Energy, Treasury, and Labor, to name a few, could enhance the poten-tial to create the societal conditions needed for people to be as healthy aspossible. Another area for greater collaboration and coordination is withnongovernmental entities. This can be particularly challenging in the areaof health care delivery because of the government 's role as regulator and payer. The same holds true at the state level. The need for effective coordinating structures is very important because most experienced government officials agree that major organizational re-structuring is rarely worth the time and political trouble involved (even if itcould be achieved), so although it may seem advisable to reunite DHHS andEPA or create a food safety agency independent from portions of FDA, theDepartment of Agriculture, and EPA, the obstacles are formidable. Bardach(1998) found, however, that various administrative mechanisms could en-hance the effectiveness of cross-agency collaboration. These may includeformal agreements at the executive level; assignment of personnel, budget,equipment, and space to a collaborative task; delegation and accountabilityfor the relationships relating to the task; and the provision of administrativeservices to support the work. The success of efforts such as the PresidentialCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html164 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH Task Force on Food Safety, the Task Force on Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children, and the multiagency task force on bioterrorismdemonstrate the benefits of cross-agency collaboration. The committee particularly noted that the lack of coordination be- tween DHHS and other agencies with health-related responsibilities oftencreates major obstacles to the effective use of federal regulatory and stan-dard-setting powers in health. Inconsistencies between DHHS agencies andother science-based regulatory agencies \u2014for example, between DHHS and EPA\u2014lead to standards on the levels of particular chemicals or toxins hazardous to the health of humans that are different from the levels hazard-ous to the health of animals and vegetation (Boufford and Lee, 2001).These issues are usually addressed on a case-by-case basis through workgroups or crisis management activities. During the Reagan administration,for example, cabinet councils chaired by a designated secretary were usedto coordinate efforts across departments. They worked when they werewell staffed and participation at the deputy or assistant secretary level wasconsistent, with secretaries available as needed (Edward Brandt, personalcommunication, 2001). A final challenge is the integration of federal standard setting and regulation with the equally varied jurisdictions of state and local healthdepartments or other health-related agencies. Again, creative and sustainedmechanisms to develop collaborative relationships and to harmonize regu-lations within DHHS, across federal agencies, and among federal, state,and local governments are critical to effective action for protecting thepopulation 's health. In June 2001, the Secretary of DHHS established the Advisory Com- mittee on Regulatory Reform. The committee is charged with conducting adepartment-wide initiative to reduce regulatory burdens in health care andto respond faster to the concerns of health care providers, state and localgovernments, and individual Americans who are affected by DHHS rules.The Advisory Committee conducted six data-gathering meetings across thecountry. The committee was expected to present a final report and recom-mendations in the fall of 2002 for changes in four areas: health care deliv-ery, health systems operations, biomedical and health research, and thedevelopment of pharmaceuticals and other products. A review of the reportshows that much attention was directed to implementing changes in thehealth care delivery component of the public health system, with littleattention paid to the regulatory inconsistencies, burdens, and inefficienciesin the governmental public health component of the system. Given these organizational and management findings, the committee recommends that the Secretary of DHHS review the regulatory authoritiesof DHHS agencies with health-related responsibilities to reduce overlapand inconsistencies, ensure that the department 's management structure isCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE 165 best suited to coordinate the efforts among agencies within DHHS with health-related responsibilities, and, to the extent possible, simplify relation-ships with state and local governmental public health agencies. Similarefforts should be made to improve coordination with other federal cabinetagencies performing important public health services, such as the Depart-ment of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency. The committee also notes that the division of authority in the federal government hinders the development of a coherent international healthpolicy. With increasing cross-border flows of people, pharmaceuticals, and food, countries cannot adequately protect their populations through unilat-eral domestic or foreign policy action; they must collaborate with othercountries and within the frameworks of international agreements. This isespecially true in matters of health and environment. The World HealthOrganization (WHO) is a forum for standard setting on issues such asinternational travel health standards, the quality of pharmaceuticals, andfood quality and safety. A lack of funding for research on diseases thatdisproportionately affect the developing world (the \"10/90 \" gap) (Davey, 2000), the weakness of the research infrastructure in these countries, andthe need to address matters of intellectual property involved in makingbasic drugs available to nations without their own production capacitiesare only a few of the issues that can benefit from high levels of involvementfrom developed countries such as the United States, with its wealth andscientific expertise. At present, the Department of State is the lead U.S. agency on interna- tional affairs and pays dues to international agencies like WHO. Because ofthe importance of health and science to its work, it has recently appointeda deputy assistant secretary for health and science. The funding for U.S.development assistance in health comes through congressional funding tothe U.S. Agency for International Development, which funds much of itsinternational health work by contract with DHHS, largely CDC. DHHShas only limited authority from Congress to spend money on internationalhealth activities. Coordination across all these agencies is critical to assur-ing a coordinated strategy for international health. During the Clintonadministration, a senior public health officer served on the National Secu-rity Council (NSC) as health liaison to the various agencies. In a consulta-tion conducted by IOM, among representatives from the major depart-ments that address international health issues (and others involved ininternational health policy, from EPA to the Departments of Agricultureand Commerce), all agreed that there was a problem in coordination andclear leadership on international health that prevented effective long-termplanning. They agreed that NSC leadership could provide a focal point forsuch coordination, absent an executive decision to appoint a lead agencyCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html166 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH (IOM, 1999). The NSC health liaison position was phased out during the early days of the Bush administration. In America 's Vital Interest in Global Health, IOM (1997a) called for better coordination of global health policy within the U.S. governmentthrough the use of a Task Force on Global Health. That report also recom-mended legislative changes to expand international authorities and fundingto DHHS \"because of its unique scientific and technical expertise \" to lead such an effort across the government and to serve as a focal point for linksto nongovernmental organizations and academia. This committee concurswith the need for an effective mechanism for coordination of internationalhealth policy making and urges the administration and Congress to con-sider steps to this end such as the appointment of a permanent NSC liaisonfor international health, the designation of a lead agency for internationalhealth or the formation of a formal cross-cabinet body, and the review ofPublic Health Service Act authorities for DHHS funding of internationalhealth initiatives. Federalism and a National Public Health Policy The relationships among various levels of government have always been complex and hotly contested. In most spheres of public health (e.g.,injury prevention, clean air and water, and infectious disease surveillanceand control), federal, state, and local governments all have a presence. As inall essential government endeavors, good communication and cooperationamong the various levels of government are vital. Federalism functions as asorting device for determining which government, federal or state, maylegitimately respond to a public health threat. Often, the national and stategovernments exercise public health powers concurrently, but the SupremacyClause gives Congress the authority to preempt state public health regula-tion, even if the state is acting squarely within its police powers ( Gade v. National Solid Waste Management Association , 505 U.S. 88, 98 [1992]). Federal preemption occurs in many areas of public health regulation, in-cluding labeling and advertising of cigarettes, self-insured health care plans,and occupational health and safety. Although there may be debates over the constitutional roles of the federal and state governments, a more fundamental concern is that each level ofgovernment operates effectively in assuring the conditions for the public 's health. First, strong public health leadership is essential. This means thatwhere the various levels of government are operating at the same time, clearunderstanding of who is in charge and who has responsibility for which tasksmust exist. During the anthrax outbreak, for example, it was often unclearwhich level of authority was in charge: the Secretary of DHHS, the localpublic health commissioners in Florida, New York, and Washington, D.C.,Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE 167 or the Department of Justice (FBI). Second, no significant gaps in public health protection should exist. This means that at least one level of govern-ment should be actively involved in dealing with important health problems. Because the major interactions of the federal and state governments in recent years have related to issues of health care financing through theMedicaid program (or through welfare programs), they have tended tofocus on arguments over money and degrees of freedom to spend it. Stateshave often been reduced to being just another interest group. If a mecha-nism could be developed to engage the states as potential partners in alarger national strategy such as the health agenda that clearly depends oncollaborative action for success, it could change these relationships. Direct relationships between the federal government and local govern- ments constitute a complicated issue. In the American system, local govern-ments are the creatures of state governments, from which they get theirauthority and resources (or the authority to raise revenues). There are morethan 90,000 units of local government in the United States; 90 percent havepopulations of less than 10,000 and 80 percent have populations of lessthan 5,000 (Cigler, 1998). Their policy-making and managerial capacitiesare highly variable, as are their capacities and resources in health. It is clearthat some units of local government look to the federal government tocorrect the inequities that they experience at the hands of state govern-ments; others are in tense relations with their state counterparts, and directfederal connections may exacerbate tensions. Ways to manage relationshipsthat engage local governments but that respect the rights of the state gov-ernments in terms of their relationships to local governments must be con-sidered in any long-term partnership-building process. The committee believes that a more comprehensive and coordinated approach to health policy is necessary to improve the alignment of federal,state, and local governmental authorities and financial resources to supporteffective action in improving population health. This kind of coordinationis critical to creating a true public health system from the multiple, oftendisconnected, and somewhat competitive organizations that must worktogether to promote and protect the health of the public. As one steptoward better coordination, DHHS should be looking to new ways tocollaborate more effectively with governmental public health agencies atthe state and local levels. This is not a new problem for DHHS. In 1960, then Surgeon General Leroy Edgar Burney convened an external expert group to \"study the present and future mission of the public health service and design the bestpossible structure to deal with its multiple new functions. \" It found that PHS needed to develop mechanisms to allow it to work \"with, rather than through state agencies \" (Study Group on the Mission and Organization of the Public Health Service, 1960). During the Nixon administration, thereCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html168 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH was similar recognition of the importance of improving relationships be- tween federal, state, and community organizations to serve the populationsin greatest need. This led to strengthening of the regional offices of DHHSand establishing an office on intergovernmental affairs. As discussed ear-lier, the department 's policy and structures for dealing with state and local governments have varied over the years, but the mechanisms within thedepartment are weak at present. One way to achieve better communication is through formal links with the national organizations representing state and local health officials,ASTHO and NACCHO, which often collaborate with the department inactivities such as the Healthy People (2010) initiative and the developmentof National Public Health Performance Standards. The department couldalso enhance its efforts to seek state and local perspectives on public healthpolicy through the National Governors Association and the U.S. Confer-ence of Mayors, which have staff who work on health issues. The committee believes that a more formal entity could facilitate the link between the Secretary of DHHS and state public health officers for thepurpose of improving communication, coordination, and collaborative ac-tion on a national health agenda. In considering the form of such an effort,it is important to recognize that the U.S. health care system is highly de-volved, and as noted earlier, historically, the major responsibility for theessential public health services has rested with state governments, but withthat responsibility subject to federal regulations and with the public healthservices partially supported by federal revenues (more revenues are pro-vided for health care delivery than for the public health infrastructure).Because governments have a unique role in assuring the conditions forhealth of the population and because health is a public good, the high levelof interdependence of federal and state governments in achieving nationalhealth goals such as those articulated in Healthy People 2010 (DHHS, 2000) requires effective communication and collaboration. In a 1997 report on the principles of state -federal relations, the Na- tional Governors Association, while noting the importance of state au-tonomy and the preservation of the ability of the states to address localcircumstances, agreed that there was a need for a federal role in certaindomestic issues \u2014when issues are national in scope and the national interest is at risk and to help states meet the needs of special populations. It alsoreaffirmed its support for a federal role in assuring equality of access,addressing the issues beyond the capacities of individual states, and ensur-ing that all states have the fiscal capacity to meet the requirements offederal goals. It further cites the critical importance of close working rela-tionships with \"our federal partners \" (NGA, 1997). Although this discus- sion did not specifically address collaboration in public health, the prin-ciples would seem to apply and call for direct interaction between theCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE 169 governmental public health leadership of states and the DHHS rather than through annual meetings of representative organizations or interest groups. Therefore, the committee recommends that Congress mandate the es- tablishment of a National Public Health Council. This National PublicHealth Council would bring together the Secretary of DHHS and statehealth commissioners at least annually to Provide a forum for communication and collaboration on action to achieve national health goals as articulated in Healthy People 2010 ; Advise the Secretary of DHHS on public health issues; Advise the Secretary of DHHS on financing and regulations that affect the governmental public health capacity at the state and local levels; Provide a forum for overseeing the development of an incentive- based federal -state-funded system to sustain a governmental public health infrastructure that can assure the availability of essential public healthservices to every American community and can monitor progress towardthis goal (e.g., through report cards); Review and evaluate the domestic policies of other cabinet agencies for their impacts on national health outcomes (e.g., through health impactreports) and for their impacts on the reduction and elimination of healthdisparities; and Submit an annual report on their deliberations and recommenda- tions to Congress. The Council should be chaired by the Secretary of DHHS and cochaired by a state public health director on a rotating basis. An appropriately resourcedsecretariat should be established in the Office of the Secretary to ensure thatthe council has access to the information and expertise of all DHHS agen-cies during its deliberations. The committee believes that public health exists within a sphere of politi- cal and policy-making activity, from which it cannot and should not beseparated. Thus, public health must operate within the boundaries of democ-racy and must take place in a rational, evidence-based political process.Therefore, the proposed Council may change with changes in administration. CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS To most effectively protect and promote the health of the population, the nation 's entire governmental public health infrastructure \u2014its human resources, information systems, and organizational capacity \u2014must be revi- talized and strengthened. Doing so will require federal, state, and localgovernmental collaboration to assess the needs in each community and toCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Furthermore, federal, state, and local governments will need to create innovative financ-ing mechanisms that can add new resources (including those from theprivate sector) to those already committed by all levels of government toinfrastructure development and capacity building and ensure that theseinvestments are sustainable over time. Most importantly, it is the responsi-bility of the federal government to ensure that these actions at the federal,state, and local levels contribute to the creation and maintenance of acomprehensive, intersectoral public health system that serves to protect andpromote the health of Americans.

The impulse dies away without the sympathy of the community. William James This chapter is at the heart of the Healthy People 2010 vision reiterated by the committee: \"healthy people in healthy communities.\" Communities areboth the physical and cultural settings for and\u2014through their residents andcommunity-based organizations\u2014participants in action to promote the public'shealth. They are also points of convergence for the interests of employers,businesses, and academia; the messages of the media; and the services of gov-ernmental public health agencies and the health care delivery system. This chapter examines the multiple dimensions of community and its critical importance to an effective public health system. This critical rolehas been a fundamental concept in the international literature on popula-tion health for many years. The Health For All initiative, begun by theWorld Health Organization in the 1970s, called for a strong primary caresystem to include basic health services, clean water and air, basic sanitation,adequate nutrition, and full engagement with the community served. In theUnited States, the sophistication of the health care delivery system and theemphasis on individual health have led to the focus of policy and resourceson the high-technology and research ends of the health care delivery spec-trum and an underestimation or overlooking of the role of the communityin achieving health gains. This is changing. DEFINING THE COMMUNITY A community can be described as a group of people who share some or all of the following: geographic boundaries; a sense of membership; cultureCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE COMMUNITY 179 and language; common norms, interests, or values; and common health risks or conditions (IOM, 1995; Jewkes and Murcott, 1996; Ruderman,2000; Ricketts, 2001). Members of communities typically experience theshared reality of living or working in the same location or environment andso are in a position to influence and be influenced by the social, economic,and physical risk factors in that environment (Roussos and Fawcett, 2000;Kreuter et al., 2001). Although acknowledging the increasing influence of\"communities of interaction \" such as online groups, this chapter focuses mainly on activities based in geographic communities \u2014neighborhoods, cit- ies, counties, and in a few cases, states \u2014that are critical to creating the conditions for a community to be as healthy as it can be. Communities consist of individuals and families, as well as the various organizations and associations that make up a community 's \"civil society \": nonprofit, nongovernmental, voluntary, or social entities, including ethnicand cultural groups; advocacy organizations; and the faith community(Salamon et al., 1999; Himmelman et al., 2001). Organizations exist be-tween the level of the individual and that of the community or society. TheUnited States has both a history of individualism and, as de Tocquevilleobserved in 1831, a rich civic tradition of individuals associating or orga-nizing to accomplish common goals. The public sector at the communitylevel encompasses local government officials and agencies traditionally seenas having health-related responsibilities, as well as many others that haveimportant but sometimes less obvious roles in health but whose policies andobjectives may have potential health consequences. The latter may includecity councils, public schools, colleges and universities, police and fire de-partments, zoning boards, housing authorities, parks and recreation agen-cies, and agricultural development and cooperative extension services. Othermembers of the community may come from the private sector, includingprivate schools, colleges, and universities; health care providers and payers;and small and large businesses. A healthy community is a place where people provide leadership in assessing their own resources and needs, where public health and socialinfrastructure and policies support health, and where essential public healthservices, including quality health care, are available. In a healthy commu-nity, communication and collaboration among various sectors of the com-munity and the contributions of ethnically, socially, and economically di-verse community members are valued. In addition, the broad array ofdeterminants of health is considered and addressed, and individuals makeinformed, positive choices in the context of health-protective and support-ive environments, policies, and systems (Goodman et al., 1996; CDC, 1997;Norris and Pittman, 2000). Health is a \"fundamental resource to the individual, the community and to society \" (Kickbusch, 1989: 13). When people are healthy, they areCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

However, as noted in Chapter 2, the health of neither individuals norpopulations occurs in a vacuum. Instead, it is shaped by a wide range offactors, such as income and education, social connectedness, employment,and access to quality health care. Inadequate and dangerous physical envi-ronments in homes, schools, neighborhoods, and workplaces and risk fac-tors such as air and water pollution, unsafe food, social isolation, high ratesof unemployment, violence, and crime constitute some of the problemsexperienced by communities. It may seem that these types of problems canbe distanced from the concerns of the general population, as if these cir-cumstances affect only certain groups (e.g., those with high blood pressure,smokers, or people who live in specific neighborhoods). In reality, theeffects of health risks touch us all in many ways, and actions to addresshealth at the population level benefit everyone in society (Rose, 1992).Moreover, the solutions for assuring population health are not owned bygovernmental public health agencies; they can be found in communities andin community organizations and partnerships (CDC, 1997; WHO, 1998;Bowles, 1999; Mitchell and Shortell, 2000). Today 's health challenges, ranging from jet-setting microbes and soaring obesity rates to emergingenvironmental risks and bioterrorism, highlight the interconnectedness ofpeople and communities and the need for joint efforts to meet those chal-lenges (McGinnis and Foege, 1993; Ruderman, 2000; Norton et al., 2002). The linkages among people and communities and people are clearly evident in the processes set into motion by globalization. A local commu-nity in many areas of the United States may be a microcosm of the worldcommunity, with a complex mix of beliefs, traditions, and languages. Giventhe rich fabric of most American communities, it has become impossible toconsider threats to health someone else 's problem. Disease and disability do not differentiate between cultures and ethnic backgrounds \u2014microbes and environmental toxins move easily among and across nations and regions,and no person or community is completely safe unless all are safe. COMMUNITY-BASED COLLABORATION Growing Commitment to Collaboration Although this report defines public health as \"what we as a society do collectively to assure the conditions in which people can be healthy \" (IOM, 1988: 1), in practice, the community 's role in health programs has some- times been that of passive recipient, beneficiary, or research subject, withactive work in public health carried out by experts (e.g., governmentalpublic health agencies) using approaches that are frequently unsuccessful inresponding to the complex issues and needs of the community (Schwab andCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE COMMUNITY 181 Syme, 1997). A great deal has changed since the Committee for the Future of Public Health observed that health departments and public health pro-fessionals worked largely in isolation, with little in the way of \"constitu- ency building, citizen participation, or continuing (as opposed to crisis-driven) communications with elected officials or with the community atlarge \" (IOM, 1988: 5). Today, dialogue and collaboration between local health departments and the communities they serve have become morecommon in practice and more critical in concept. For example, a recentstudy of 10 local health departments from different states found that theywere substantially involved with community and youth organizations,schools, and the media in the areas of tobacco use prevention, injury pre-vention, and physical activity promotion (McHugh et al., 2000). Many communities, through individuals and organizations, have become partners with health departments in health improvement and have even be-come leaders in spearheading collaborative efforts (Fawcett et al., 1996;Mitchell and Shortell, 2000; Norton et al., 2002). The present committeefound during its site visit to the Caring Community Network of the TwinRivers, a Turning Point site in New Hampshire (see Appendix F), an exampleof an innovative way to create a local public health system that works effec-tively despite a limited governmental public health infrastructure. This com-munity, a spread-out cluster of 12 towns, has no health department. Instead,each town has a more or less volunteer health officer, who in some cases isnot a health professional. The work of assuring the public 's health is carried out through the collaborative efforts of committed individuals and groups,including the local public health officials, health care and mental healthservices providers, social service and community development organizations,educators, and the chamber of commerce (CCNTR, 2001). In authentic community-based partnerships, the participation and con- tributions of various stakeholders are likely to produce benefits in the formof increased effectiveness and productivity by reducing duplication of effortand avoiding the imposition of solutions that are not congruent with thelocal culture and needs. Community partnerships are also likely to have thebenefits of empowering the participants, strengthening social engagement,establishing trust, and ensuring accountability (Israel et al., 1998; Mitchelland Williams and Yanoshik,2001; Wolff, 2001a, 2001b). A variety of vehicles can be used for community collaborations, includ- ing coalitions, partnerships, community advisory boards, consumers ' rights and advocacy groups, and nonprofit organizations. These groupings canbring together participants from many sectors of a community, includingbusinesses, ethnic groups, faith-based organizations, and various publicagencies.

By 1997, it had expanded to include 60 organizations and100 individuals. The coalition brought together governmental agencies suchas the state and local public health departments and state and local exten-sion offices, nonprofit community and professional organizations, and busi-nesses such as supermarkets to prevent chronic disease through dietarychange and exercise (Johnston et al., 1996). Some opportunities for collaboration have less obvious but important health effects, as in the case of community redevelopment efforts. Theeconomic condition of a community has clear implications for health.Higher employment levels, for example, tend to improve not only personalincome and access to health insurance but also a community 's tax revenues and, thus, its ability to address health threats and to provide opportunitiesfor health improvement. In some communities, local health departmentshave become partners in efforts to revitalize neighborhoods through theremediation of areas with industrial waste and environmental contamina-tion (NACCHO, 2000a). Empowerment zones and enterprise communitiesare examples of public -private partnerships with significant government resources requiring collaboration at the local level to improve health incommunities. A recent study found that 119 of the 144 national empower-ment zones and enterprise communities initiatives had an interest in healthissues (PHF, 2000). Some collaborations come into existence through the independent ini- tiative of communities or community groups, whereas others are created inresponse to an outside stimulus, such as when government agencies orfoundations require the formation of broad partnerships as part of grantprocesses (Mitchell and Shortell, 2000). The committee is encouraged to seeindications that governmental public health agencies, community healthcenters, hospitals, and health maintenance organizations recognize thatcommunity collaboration is a necessity in health improvement (CDC, 1997;Pronk and O 'Connor, 1997; Omenn, 1999). Some of the major federal and foundation initiatives that require and support the creation of broad-basedcommunity coalitions include Healthy Start, a community-based infantmortality reduction program; Turning Point 1 and Community Voices,2 1 Turning Point is a grant program of the W. K. Kellogg and Robert Wood Johnson Foundations that began in 1996 and ended in 2002. The goal of Turning Point has been to \"transform and strengthen the public health infrastructure in the United States \" by support- ing states and local communities to \"improve the performance of their public health functions through strategic development and implementation processes \" (www.wkkf.org). 2 Community Voices is a 5-year initiative launched by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation in 1998 in 13 U.S. communities. The goal of Community Voices is to improve health care for the uninsured and underinsured by strengthening and securing the safety net and community support services.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE COMMUNITY 183 privately funded community public health improvement grant programs; and Center for Substance Abuse Prevention programs, which support com-munity-based substance abuse prevention \"systems \" that involve commu- nity coalitions and intersectoral collaboration (Lasker et al., 2001). Ingredients for Successful Collaboration Although collaborations to improve community health have become increasingly common, the committee recognizes that bringing together di-verse agendas, institutional cultures and jargon, personalities, and expecta-tions can be complicated, frustrating, and sometimes disappointing. Onelesson that has been learned from such experiences, however, is that thecommunity must be engaged before an agenda is set \u2014the active participa- tion of community leaders, members, and organizations is needed in theearliest stages of community-based public health action, if it is not alreadythe force that drives such action (The Lewin Group, 2002). The initialcommunication and networking necessary to launch a community healthimprovement project entail frank examination and discussion of motiva-tions, approaches, and goals by all stakeholders. At times, agencies andorganizations may seek to implement their own unilateral agendas in com-munities, driven by scientific, political, economic, or professional interests,with token community involvement and often negative outcomes (Schwaband Syme, 1997; Fawcett, 1999; Norton et al., 2002). Many communitieshave been \"coalitioned to death \" without reaping any significant benefits (Himmelman et al., 2001). Such problems illustrate the need for thoughtful,broadly inclusive, well-planned, and realistic community health improve-ment approaches. Clearly, community health initiatives involve complex social and rela- tional dynamics, as well as efforts to produce change that require signifi-cant investments of time and resources (Wickizer et al., 1998; et al.,2000; Sharpe et et al., 2001). The impor-tance of allotting adequate time to the process of collaborative planningwas well illustrated during the committee 's site visit to Healthy New Or- leans, a Turning Point project in Louisiana (see Appendix F). Healthy NewOrleans worked over a period of 2 years to build a partnership of diversestakeholders. After establishing and clarifying roles and relationships, thepartnership was able to develop a plan for community health improvementthat was truly a product of community knowledge and effort (Healthy NewOrleans, 2001). The HIV/AIDS movement provides another example of successful col- laboration for community action (Stewart and Weinstein, 1997). AIDSvolunteerism has uniquely demonstrated the effectiveness of turning peopleaffected by AIDS into experts who both (1) mobilized community buildingCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html184 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH and (2) transformed community attitudes and norms to achieve behavioral change. Communities working on a range of health issues may have muchto learn from the example set by the gay and lesbian communities ' collabo- rative action. Yet, although the HIV/AIDS movement has succeeded inmobilizing public opinion and action, more research is needed to showwhat has worked best in mobilizing action and changing community normsand thus warrants replication (Kegeles and Hart, 1998; Reger et al., 2000). Research to assess the effectiveness of community collaborations has had somewhat mixed results because of the heterogeneity of communities,the long time lines involved in achieving community health improvementgoals, and other complexities inherent in community-driven public healthactivities (Sharpe et al., 2000; Lasker et al., 2001). However, a growingbase of empirical evidence from programs such as Turning Point and Com-munity Voices provides a good road map for communities and their part-ners. Health improvement and other positive outcomes typically result fromcollaborations that are sustained over the long term, that institutionalizeeffective programs and processes, and that mobilize and utilize all availableresources to deal with evolving challenges and population health issues(Fawcett et al., 2000b, 2000c). Success is also more likely with strong community engagement, an awareness of the community 's social dynamics, and leadership that reflects the racial and ethnic diversity of the community (CDC, 1997). Other im-portant ingredients include having a clear vision and goals to guide actionplanning; allotting adequate time and financial, technical, and other sup-portive resources to collaborations and their health improvement efforts;and recognizing the importance of data collection and dissemination (CDC,1997; W. K. Kellogg Foundation, 1997; Fawcett et al., 2000c; Roussos andFawcett, 2000). Success in specific health improvement activities can de-pend on the use of varied strategies and on their intensity, duration, andpenetration into the community (Fawcett et al., 2000b; Wilcox and Knapp,2000; Lasker et al., 2001; Paine-Andrews, 2002). Problems arise around leadership, governance, and other management issues, such as planning and evaluation. Inadequate resources of various sorts \u2014 insufficient or inadequate funding or data, short time lines, or a lack of techni-cal support \u2014also contribute to problems, as does a lack of broad and authentic community engagement, which may be reflected in narrowly formed partner-ships that do not include all the sectors of the community needed for efficientand effective action (Himmelman et al., 2001; Lasker et al., 2001). Sharing Public Health Governance Ultimate legal responsibility for safeguarding and promoting the health of the population rests with governmental public health agencies at thefederal, state, and local levels (see Chapter 3), but those agencies cannot beCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE COMMUNITY 185 effective acting alone. They must be partners in a broader network of individuals and organizations with the potential to act within a publichealth system. At the local level, in particular, health departments canbecome the facilitators and supporters of strong local public health systemsthat are informed by community voices, responsive to community needs,and linked to community assets. The committee supports a type of shared governance through which the agenda for population health is truly \"owned \" by the population it serves (Turning Point Community Health Governance Workgroup, 2001a and b;The Lewin Group, 2002). This entails providing opportunities for commu-nity input and leadership in planning and in funding decisions. It also re-quires educating the public about the concepts of public health, including thecore functions and essential services (see Chapter 1), to help ensure thatpublic health agencies are accountable to those they serve (Becnel, 2001). Anapproach used in some communities is governance of the health departmentby a local board of health, whose members come from various sectors of thecommunity (see Chapter 3). The committee also encourages community in-volvement in the governance of other health-related activities. For example, amajority of the members of oversight boards for community health centersthat receive federal funding (under Section 330 of the Public Health Law)must be community users of those facilities ' services. The Turning Point initiative \u2014which involves 41 communities across 14 states \u2014exemplifies shared governance. The most successful of the Turn- ing Point sites mobilized the community from the earliest stages of assessingneeds and setting an agenda for public health system change. These partner-ships made community engagement a permanent and ongoing element. Infact, the community 's role became institutionalized in the local public health system through formal policies, investments, and programs (The LewinGroup, 2002). This national experiment in transforming local governmen-tal public health agencies (Turning Point Community Health GovernanceWorkgroup, 2001b) suggests that making shared governance a reality re-quires tools that formalize the governance structure so that it can achievelegitimacy. Also necessary are optimal communication between the com-munity and the governing group and systematic, efficient and flexible man-agement of operations (Turning Point Community Health GovernanceWorkgroup, 2001b). The National Public Health Performance StandardsProgram 3 includes an evolving set of model standards for the role of a 3 The National Public Health Performance Standards Program is a collaborative effort by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, National Association of County and City Health Officials, National Association of Local Boards of Health, American Public Health Association, and Public Health Foundationto develop measurable performance standards to help ensure that state and local public health systems are able to and do deliver the 10 essential public health services (CDC, 2001).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

FRAMEWORK FOR COLLABORATIVE COMMUNITY ACTION ON HEALTH Once the collaboration has been created, several frameworks are avail- able for use by communities, health departments, and their partners. Someof these models include the Planned Approach to Community Health, Mo-bilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships, and the CommunityHealth Improvement Process (Kreuter, 1992; IOM, 1997). The modelsprovide step-by-step guidance for various aspects of the health improve-ment process, including assessing the health status of the community andthe capacity of the local governmental public health agency. This chapter uses a simple framework provided by Fawcett and col- leagues (2000b) to help describe the activities and processes involved incommunity action on health (CDC, 2002). This framework illustrates fivekey components of the activities and processes needed in community healthaction (Figure 4 -1). Figure 4 -1 illustrates a process that is often cyclical rather than linear, with work on one health improvement initiative leadingto subsequent reassessments of a community 's health needs and priorities.

Each step of the framework for collaborative action will be discussed and illustrated with examples from the experience of community healthimprovement programs and initiatives. Assessing, Prioritizing, and Planning The processes of assessing, prioritizing, and planning will help commu- nity partnerships formulate a clear statement of goals to guide their work.These collaborative tasks are the first components of community action forhealth, but they also must be ongoing activities throughout a community 's health improvement efforts (IOM, 1996b, 1997; GHCF, 2001). By engag-ing in these activities, communities come to understand the context, causes,and solutions for various health problems. They include taking inventory ofcommunity assets and resources, identifying priorities for community ac-tion, and planning the actions to be taken. Community organizing andcoalition building are necessary if these activities are to be collaborative. The Health Action initiative in Monroe County, New York, provides a good example of community involvement in assessing, prioritizing, andplanning for health improvement (Milbank Memorial Fund, 1998; HealthAction, 2001). Founded in 1995, Health Action is a collaborative of healthcare providers, hospitals and clinics, the local health department, an urbanhealth commission, a university, the chamber of commerce, a large employ-ers' organization, and a professional association. Between 1998 and 2001, report cards were developed and released for five areas: (1) the health ofmothers and children, (2) the health of adolescents, (3) the health of adults,(4) the health of older adults, and (5) environmental health. Focused goalsand action plans were developed for each area. For adults and older adults,Health Action selected two goals: to promote healthy behaviors that pre-vent or delay chronic disease and to promote the use of preventive healthservices. Health promotion objectives included increasing physical activityand providing nutrition education and weight management, with the aim ofdecreasing the chronic disease risks posed by overweight and obesity. In2001, Health Action 's Adult/Older Adult coalition began work on a com- munications campaign supported by program activities (such as workplacefitness) to make Monroe County a more physically active community. Certain types of quantitative data, such as rates of disease, injury, and death, have usually been available to communities. Other data have becomemore readily available as more states and local communities, usually with theleadership or support of governmental public health agencies, have begun toCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The availability of data for small areas (at the subcounty level) hasbeen an issue in general for community health programs, and it highlights theneed for high-quality, comprehensive assessments of community health toguide action. In 2000, the Health Resources and Services Administration 's Community Health Status Indicators (CHSI) Project produced a set of healthassessment documents for each of the 3,082 counties in the United States andmade them available online (www.communityhealth.hrsa.gov/). The CHSIdocuments, which used a set of indicators for which comparable data wereavailable for nearly all counties, can serve as a useful starting point forselecting indicators of particular interest to a given community, for makingcomparisons with other communities throughout the country, or for plan-ning an update of a community 's indicators. A community-based approach to health improvement that considers the broad range of social and environmental determinants of health maycall for the use of a variety of indicators, including ones that measurecharacteristics of the community rather than those of individuals (i.e.,community-level indicators). Community report cards and other types ofregular assessments should include not only measures directly related tohealth, such as infant mortality rates and the incidence of infectious dis-eases, but also measures related to various health determinants (IOM,1997). Indicators could include local employment rates, housing stocks,and levels of income and education, along with less conventional indica-tors such as the density of liquor stores; the quality of air and water; theavailability of parks and green spaces, housing, and public transportation;and other measures of livability. In addition, qualitative or anecdotal data(e.g., residents ' satisfaction with the community, feelings of community cohesion, or informal measures of social capital) may also be an importantpart of the assessment process. The interest in community-level indicators is reflected in the work of a panel organized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whichdeveloped indicators for cardiovascular health in three risk areas: diet,physical inactivity, and tobacco use (Cheadle et al., 2000). The community-level indicators for physical inactivity, for example, included \"miles of walking trails per capita \" and \"presence of local policy to include physical education in public K -12 curriculum \" (Cheadle et al., 2000: 112). Cross- cutting indicators included the number of media reports that dealt withsmoking, nutrition, and physical activity and the number of assessments orscreenings within the community for all cardiovascular risk factors. Anadded benefit of community-level indicators is the fact that they are some-times easier and less expensive to measure than indicators based on thebehaviors or characteristics of individuals, which may require costly house-hold surveys.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE COMMUNITY 189 The committee notes that new and evolving information and communi- cations technologies are increasingly valuable resources for community-driven public health action (Fawcett et al., 2000a). The University of Kan-sas Community Tool Box, for example, is an online resource forcommunity-based public health planning and action (http://ctb.lsi.ukans.edu/). The Internet has become instrumental in helping community groupsand organizations obtain essential data and information, communicate withpartners, and provide technical assistance and support to other collabora-tions and coalitions in their own community and elsewhere. In recent years,geographic information systems have also become a powerful tool for spa-tial analysis of diseases, environmental contamination, and social and de-mographic information (ATSDR, 2000). Some of the governmental juris-dictions (i.e., states) using this technology are able to share vital informationwith communities and their partners. Implementing Targeted Action The second component of community-driven health improvement efforts is implementing targeted action to address high-priority health issues (Fawcettet al., 2000b). As a result of some of the lessons learned in communitycollaborative action, observers commend the use of multiple strategies, suchas education, various forms of communication, political or legal action, andenvironmental interventions (Fawcett, 1999). Some observers emphasize thatcommunity action should focus on changing the community conditions orindividual behaviors that affect health risks rather than on only providinghealth care or other services to individuals (Johnston et al., 1996). As a result of the sometimes long and often complicated chain of events between program implementation and desired health outcomes, communi-ties are encouraged to focus on proven strategies and best practices toenhance their chances of success (IOM, 1997; Butterfoss et al., 2001).Resources such as The Guide to Community Preventive Services (Task Force on Community Preventive Services, 2000), which provides evidence-based evaluations of various interventions, can help communities selectappropriate strategies. In some cases, however, coalitions may be justifiedin selecting interventions that are favored by the community, even if evi-dence for their effectiveness is weak, to build ownership in communityaction and to nurture meaningful participation (Himmelman, 2001; W. K.Kellogg Foundation, 2001). The challenge is to achieve a balance betweenthe interrelated efforts to engage coalition involvement and sustain its well-being and to invest in strategies that increase the likelihood of meetinghealth goals. The strategies and activities implemented by community partnerships may depend on the particular perspectives and resources brought to theCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

For example, groups that represent the interests of ethnic communities (e.g., National Council of La Raza, Congress of Na-tional Black Churches, and Association of Asian Pacific Community HealthOrganizations) or consumers ' rights and advocacy groups can help mobi- lize communities for action, provide public education, and advocate forpolicy change to safeguard population health. Businesses may change theirpractices and policies to address community health concerns and employeehealth needs (see Box 4 -1). Depending on the nature of the business, such changes might include implementing policies to ban smoking in publicplaces, providing health information to employees and customers, or im-proving compliance with environmental laws and regulations pertaining toair and water quality. Religious congregations, which are among \"the most pervasive vol- untary organizations in our society, \" and other faith-based entities can play a significant role in community health improvement (DHHS, 1999).For instance, the outreach workers of Oakland 's Asian Health Services reach Korean groups with information about health care access at churchhealth fairs. Faith-based groups are often community institutions, deeplyrooted in neighborhoods, and may play an important role in local publichealth systems and community-based health improvement initiatives(DHHS, 1999; Lundblad, 1999). This is especially true in many African-American communities. Additionally, faith communities can act as con-veners and mobilizers of community residents and others affiliated withthem around issues of health policy and interventions for health promo-tion and disease prevention (e.g., nutrition, fitness, and health screeningservices) (see Box 4 -2).BOX 4-1 Community in Action to Address the Environment In New York State, the Monroe County Health Department and other public and private community partners formed the Water Education Collaborative to educatecitizens about protecting water quality. The Industrial Management Council, the Monroe County Health Department, and the Rochester Institute of Technology are collaborating on a plan to provide environmental health training and technical as-sistance to small- and medium-size businesses. This will help local businesses develop environmental management systems (environmental monitoring, waste recycling). The Kodak and Xerox corporations, which are headquartered locally,already provide leadership in this area. SOURCE: Health Action (2001).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

For example, in communities across the United States,health promoters, 4 community health workers, or community outreach work- ers link community members to systems of care, help to mobilize communi-ties to change the conditions for health, and conduct health education (Ramoset al., 2001). Community workers seem to be most effective when they areselected from among individuals who are respected and trusted by theircommunities, for example, informal community leaders. In addition to theirknowledge of the community 's needs, their formal participation in the public health enterprise may also reassure community groups that are wary of gov-BOX 4 -2 A Project in the Faith Community Project Joy was conducted by university researchers in collaboration with a local faith community to promote cardiovascular health among church-goingAfrican-American women in Baltimore, Maryland (Yanek et al., 2001). Sixteen churches were randomly selected, and 529 female members of those churches received one of three behavioral interventions: an active intervention with a spir-itual component, an active intervention without the spiritual component, and a self-help intervention as a control group. The active intervention consisted of weekly sessions on nutrition, including cooking demonstrations and taste tests,and 30 minutes of some moderate aerobic activity, conducted by project educa- tors in collaboration with trained lay leaders from the churches. The spiritual component consisted of religious messages and prayer and gospel music forworkout sessions. The control intervention provided only educational material and a hotline for health education consultation. By the end of the intervention, the two active groups were virtually indistin- guishable, because the one without a preplanned spiritual component had created its own. Both of the groups with the active intervention experienced significant improvements, compared with the self-help group, in weight, waist circumference,blood pressure, dietary energy, and total fat and sodium intakes. The input and participation of the community in planning and implementation and a supportive social environment resulted in behavioral changes that led to improved health.Four years after the project began, eight of the nine churches with an active inter- vention, plus the church that hosted the pilot intervention, continue the weekly support and education sessions\u2014an example of sustained, institutionalizedchange (Yanek et al., 2001). 4 In Spanish-speaking communities, they are called promotores ; if all promoters are women, as is sometimes the case, they are called promotoras.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

During site visits, the committee observed that community workers are used with apparent success by several projects around the country. In Or-ange County, California, Latino Health Access, a community-based organi-zation, receives community input, works collaboratively with the localcounty health department, and manages paid promotores who provide edu- cation and link community members to services and resources, includingthose provided by the health department (Bracho, 2000). The Asian HealthServices and La Clinica de La Raza in Oakland, California, use the servicesof staff members from several ethnic communities to conduct culturally andlinguistically competent health promotion and health care outreach in thosecommunities (see Appendix F). Baltimore 's Vision for Health Consortium and Men 's Health Center (see Appendix F) have community advocates or outreach workers whoperform a range of services, including linking uninsured community mem-bers to a \"medical home, \" following up with individuals who do not return for test results or treatment, and providing assistance with other referralsand linkages. Denver Health, in Denver, Colorado, also uses the services ofcommunity outreach workers to help community members who are unin-sured gain access to health care services and to provide health promotionand health education services in the community (see Appendix F). DenverHealth 's unique public -private public health infrastructure has developed a process for training community outreach workers and integrating them intothe public health workforce. Classes and even a degree program are avail-able through local community colleges. In Arizona, a similar promotora training program has been created by the Border Health Fronteriza projectand is coordinated by the University of Arizona (HRSA, 2001). Changing Community Conditions and Systems Changing community conditions and systems is the third component of the framework for community action to improve health. It involves chang-ing aspects of the physical, social, organizational, and even political envi-ronments to eliminate or reduce factors that contribute to health problemsor to introduce new elements that promote better health. Such changesmight include instituting new programs, policies, and practices; changingaspects of the physical or organizational infrastructure in the community;and changing community attitudes and beliefs or social norms (Fawcett etal., 2000b; Mitchell and Shortell, 2000) (see Box 4 -3). Some policy changes, for example, are aimed directly at health-related concerns such as improv-ing access to health care or preventing injury and disease through meanssuch as regulation of alcohol and tobacco sales, the institution of require-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Vari-ous tools can be applied in efforts to achieve changes in community condi-tions and systems. These can include school and workplace-based educa-tional programs, social marketing, and other social transformationactivities. Community groups can also advocate for government bodies totake appropriate actions, such as regulating environmental pollutants. In-formed and mobilized communities can help ensure that government agen-cies enforce such regulations. The committee found many examples of community-based efforts to modify local conditions as part of a health improvement initiative. Theseare, in a very real sense, examples of a public health system in action tocreate conditions in communities for people to choose healthy behaviors.Holder and colleagues (2001), for example, reported on a multilevel inter-vention in a South Carolina community that was aimed at changing policiesand practices through several proven components, including communitycoalition building and the development and enactment of policies on alco-hol outlets. These interventions increased law enforcement as well as theperception in the community that drunk drivers would be caught. In addi-tion, local businesses modified their policies for beverage service, and com-munity groups became mobilized to change the zoning policies that gov-erned the density of alcohol outlets. Following the intervention, rates ofcrashes related to drunk driving were significantly reduced and binge drink-ing declined. Holder and colleagues (2001) concluded that education andpublic awareness about a health problem had to be supplemented withenvironmental strategies that brought about community and system changesto achieve the health improvement goal of injury reduction. Kansas LEAN, the state coalition mentioned previously, facilitated aBOX 4 -3 Communities in Action to Address Mental Illness Communities can be catalysts for a change in societal attitudes toward depres- sion and other mental illnesses \u2014the first step in addressing the stigma attached to these conditions (Corrigan and Penn, 1999; Link et al., 1999; Corrigan et al., 2001). This change may encourage people dealing with mental illness to seek treatment. Through educational efforts, communities can reinforce the public health messagethat depression and other mental illnesses are real and disabling conditions that can be treated effectively (DHHS, 1999). Communities can also combat the stigma attached to mental illness through sponsorship of low-cost programs that construc-tively bring the public into contact with people with mental illness.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The system changesincluded modifying lunch menus in elementary schools, changing schoolcurricula by adding nutrition education and enhanced exercise activities,supporting the adoption by several employers of a pilot-tested work-siteprogram to lower the intake of dietary fat, working with supermarkets toimplement price reductions and shelf prompts for lower-fat foods, andconducting events to promote lean eating in the African-American faithcommunity and among state legislators (Fawcett et al., 1997). The Healthy Neighborhoods Project (HNP) in western Contra Costa County, California, brought together community residents, the health de-partment, community organizations, and sometimes other partners fromthe public, private, and civic sectors (Minkler, 2000). Using trained com-munity organizers and neighborhood health advocates, the project con-ducted a qualitative assessment of the community 's health-related needs and capacities. Data on air quality led to changes in areas such as transpor-tation (Minkler, 2000). Another part of the initiative reached recipients offood stamps with information about food and nutrition. HNP also workedwith organizers of a local outdoor festival to ban smoking. The activities tochange policies related to smoking built on a history of successes, includinglocal collaboration among nonprofit organizations, the health department,and other groups to implement a strong clean-indoor-air policy as well as atobacco-free youth policy. Today, the Contra Costa County health depart-ment provides a real and virtual (online) community gateway for gettinginvolved with existing health-related coalitions, including HNP (ContraCosta Health Services, 2001). Bias, prejudice, and stereotyping (IOM, 2002) and a sometimes overt lack of cultural competence (see Box 4 -4) characterize many institutional and community health settings. Culturally competent public health servicesare essential for the success of efforts to improve health and eliminatedisparities. Staff members present during the committee 's site visit to Oakland 's Community Voices project considered health care delivery ser- vices without cultural competence completely unacceptable, leading tohealth care encounters that lack basic communication and fail to empoweror engage clients in addressing their own health needs (Bayne-Smith, 1996).However, altering discriminatory attitudes and norms, which are some-times deceptively subtle, and overcoming cultural and linguistic barrierspose significant challenges and require institutional and individual commit-ments from all entities that are potential partners within the public healthsystem. Cultural diversity and the knowledge and resources often associated with it are valuable community assets, making communities and systemsbetter equipped to interact appropriately with diverse populations. TheCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE COMMUNITY 195 Office of Minority Health has developed standards for culturally and lin- guistically appropriate services in health care to provide guidance and toolsfor health care providers, policy makers, purchasers, patients and advo-cates, educators, and accreditation or credentialing entities (DHHS, 2001).Standard 12 recommends that health care organizations use a range ofmechanisms to \"develop participatory, collaborative partnerships with com- munities \" to facilitate the community 's involvement in the processes that ensure cultural and linguistic competence (DHHS, 2001). The process of changing community conditions and systems may also require modification of institutional cultures in terms of attitudes and be-liefs about sharing power. This may include changes in attitudes about therole of an empowered citizenry vis- \u00e0-vis the role of experts, such as profes- sionals who have traditionally occupied positions of authority (Schwab andSyme, 1997; Bowles, 1999). A participant in the committee 's site visit to Healthy New Orleans poignantly summarized an aspect of this tension byasking what it would take before communities could be heard without firsthaving to get the \"Ivory Tower Seal of Approval \" (personal communica- tion by coalition member to committee members, 2001). Dysfunctionalorganizational practices may indirectly shape public perceptions and actionabout health, for example, by discouraging community initiative or bydampening innovation through rigid categorical funding systems. At the political level, the commitment of elected officials to communitywide health action can have an enormous influence on broaden-ing the impact of a program and increasing the likelihood of sustainabilityof programs and outcomes. The American Health Decisions network ofstate organizations has been pioneering new methods of involving the pub-lic in community dialogues about health values and trade-off options. TheBOX 4 -4 Working with Communities for Cultural Competence In 1994 the California Cultural Competency Taskforce defined cultural compe- tence as \"appropriate and effective communication which requires the willingness to listen to and learn from members of diverse cultures, and the provision of ser- vice and information in appropriate languages, at appropriate comprehension and literacy levels, and in the context of an individual 's cultural health beliefs and prac- tices\" (Chin, 2000: 26). Cultural competence entails the provision of services, training, and promotional materials in the context of an individual 's or a community 's culture and social and historical circumstances and in a range of languages or through interpreters, to whom easy and rapid access is possible (Bayne-Smith, 1996; Chin, 2000).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html196 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH state of Oregon 's Health Decisions project in the 1980s may be the most visible example of such an effort. Led by the governor, it involved extensivepublic education and a long series of statewide public hearings, resulting inthe Oregon Health Plan setting priorities for public and private healthinsurance coverage. The states of Georgia and California have initiatedHealth Decisions projects, and although mostly focused on health carereform, the model illustrates the power of political commitment in helpingto mobilize community engagement on health issues (Kari et al., 1994). Achieving Widespread Change in Behavior and Risk Factors Changing individual behavior to avoid health-related risk factors is an- other stage on the road to health improvement. Behavioral change maysometimes be achieved through interventions, such as health education andcounseling, that are aimed directly at individuals, although the evidence baseshows that a broad array of interventions go beyond the individual andfunction at an ecological level (e.g., the neighborhood or the workplace).Efforts to change individual risk must consider the influence of communityconditions and systems that affect the population in general (see Box 4 -5). The effective way to approach health improvement from a population health perspective has been to focus on a combination of individual andcommunity factors. For example, Callahan (2000: 164) observed that\"people can and do stop smoking on their own, but it is easier for them if their family members and friends don 't smoke, if they can 't smoke in their workplace, and if the taxes on cigarettes make buying tobacco productsexceedingly expensive. \" Individual behavior and health risks can be shaped by conditions throughout the community, including the workplace, busi-ness practices, and neighborhood resources. Many communities have been motivated to address tobacco-related issues, such as teen smoking, smoking cessation, and advertising for to-bacco products, as exemplified by coalitions formed in Florida, Massachu-setts, Minnesota, and Missouri to influence policy and public opinion (Heserand Begay, 1997; Fisher et al., 1998; Givel and Glantz, 2000; Johnson,2000). In St. Louis, Missouri, Neighbors for a Smoke Free North Side tookon smoking cessation (Fisher et al., 1998). The project was implemented inthree neighborhoods, with four zip code areas in Kansas City, Missouri,serving as comparators. The interventions included media inputs (inter-views and stories), billboards, community events, and other health promo-tion efforts. Unlike the COMMIT (Community Intervention Trial for Smok-ing Cessation) randomized controlled trials, which, although well designed,had just one modest and partial positive outcome (Susser, 1995), this projectfound a significant decline in the prevalence of self-reported smoking afterthe intervention. It also demonstrated an association between its successCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE COMMUNITY 197 and the profound involvement of community members in planning, imple- mentation, and governance of the project (Fisher et al., 1998). Most community partnerships mentioned in this chapter aimed to change behavior and risk factors for the community as a whole. The activi-ties of Kansas LEAN, for example, focused on modifying the environmentto encourage improved dietary choices, such as consumption of foods lowerin fat. The coalitions associated with the Healthy New Orleans TurningPoint project expressed an understanding of the relationship between healthand built environments that are unsafe, unpleasant, or otherwise incompat-ible with living an active life. They described a vision of improving neigh-borhoods by adding green spaces to facilitate walking and other activities. In Contra Costa County, California, observation and statistics indi- cated that African-American women were less likely to receive breast can-cer screening for reasons related to the cost of care and a fear of diagnosis,leading to significantly higher rates of mortality from breast cancer in thisBOX 4 -5 Ideas for Communities in Action: Obesity Community-based programs are essential to combating the increasing rates of overweight and obesity in the United States (ACS, 2002). These programs shouldbe culturally specific and relevant to the community being targeted because of cultural differences in foods and in perceptions and attitudes about weight and appearance. For example, in some cultures a heavy child may be viewed as beinghealthy, whereas a thin child may be considered weak or ill. The use of a range of strategies, such as social marketing, health education, and policy change, is essential. In addition to traditional methods that have somelimited success \u2014such as education about the value of eating well and being ac- tive\u2014communities can engage in other activities that change the environments that enable sedentary lifestyles and poor eating choices. They can facilitate exer-cise by working with community development and planning agencies to make parks and playing fields safe and accessible. Schools can become sites for acces- sible and affordable community recreation centers. Communities might also devel-op relationships with farmers to make fresh fruits and vegetables more readily available and affordable through weekly markets. Recently, the Los Angeles Uni- fied School District discontinued soda vending on all school premises in the dis-trict, thus removing an element that has been linked to childhood obesity (Wood, 2002). Community restaurants and grocery stores could offer and advertise healthy food choices. Communities could also engage the media and other partners. Therecently launched Hearts N ' Parks program, sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the National Recreation and Park Association, is getting communities interested and mobilized to become physically active by plan-ning a variety of community and educational activities (NIH, 2001).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html198 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH group (Ryan, 2001). Such barriers became an overwhelming factor in shap- ing the health behaviors of affected women. A collaborative health depart-ment -community initiative to improve access to breast cancer screening for African-American women helped promote behavioral change that ultimatelyclosed the early diagnosis gap between African-American and white women. Part of the difficulty of changing behaviors is related to the tension between historical, social, and cultural concepts of responsibilities andrights, such as the question of personal responsibility for poor health (e.g.,in relation to lifestyle). The committee has found a growing recognition ofand empirical support for the influence of population-level factors on thehealth risk and health status of individuals and populations. This is re-flected in the determinants of health discussion in Chapter 2. Efforts tochange health behavior and address risk factors cannot reach optimal effec-tiveness if they depend solely on one-on-one health education or healthpromotion interventions (Economos et al., 2001). Improving the Population's Health Achieving improvement in the health of the public is the final step in the collaborative framework described in this chapter. Depending on thegoals of community interventions, these improvements might take the formof lower rates of obesity, reductions in the number of injuries resulting fromdrunk driving, or fewer cases of sexually transmitted diseases. Sometimes,however, it can be difficult to directly link the desired health outcomes to acommunity 's health actions. The connecting pathways are frequently long and complex. For example, it takes 20 to 30 years to see lower rates of lungcancer after the percentage of the population that smokes has been reduced.Moreover, the effect of a community 's actions can be obscured by other societal (secular) trends that may either reinforce or counteract the desiredchange (Paine-Andrews et al., 2000a). Despite the difficulties inherent in evaluating final outcomes, progress can be measured by monitoring changes in indicators that reflect intermedi-ate outcomes of community actions, such as higher rates of screening forbreast cancer (decreasing mortality) or an increase in the number of com-munity recreation facilities (decreasing obesity). Although such indicatorsmay not specifically measure health or health-related activities (Ricketts,2001), intermediate measures of community and system changes can beassociated with subsequent changes in health outcomes (Fawcett et al.,1997). For example, the activities of a coalition-driven substance abuseprevention project in Kansas led to changes in community policies, pro-grams, and practices (e.g., enhanced law enforcement) that were ultimatelylinked to a decline in single-vehicle crashes at night and related reductionsin injuries and deaths.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE COMMUNITY 199 Observable and measurable changes within communities and the sys- tems that provide services and assure health offer not only intermediatemeasures of progress and coalition performance but also vital feedback forcommunity members. The Healthy People agendas ( Healthy People 2000 and Healthy People 2010 ), which have been adopted to guide national health policy and which have been embraced by 47 states, play an impor-tant role in measuring the health status of the national \"community. \" An update of progress in meeting Healthy People 2000 goals indicates that ofits 319 indicators (organized by 22 health objectives) 15 percent met thegoals, 44 percent are making progress in the correct direction, 18 percentare moving away from the specified target, 9 percent have mixed results,and the progress for the remaining indicators cannot be measured at thistime (NCHS, 1999). EVALUATING AND RESEARCHING COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT Communities interface with the research community in a variety of ways. Sometimes, community organizations collaborate with academicinstitutions to conduct needs assessments or monitor and evaluate programeffectiveness. In other cases, academic researchers study communities tobuild an evidence base on the ways in which communities work and whatworks in communities. In more recent cases, community-based participa-tory research (see Chapter 8) has come to be a valued area of public healthresearch, and partnerships among community groups and organizationsand public health researchers and practitioners have become more commonand fruitful (Israel et al., 1998). The committee agrees with those who argue that communities and community members must, for both practical and ethical reasons, be part-ners in health improvement interventions and in the research that guidesthese interventions (Green and Kreuter, 1991; Kretzmann Richard, 2001; Nortonet al., 2002). On a practical level, engaging the community in public healthresearch may help with complicated (and often sensitive) issues such asdefining research priorities or interpreting results (Israel et al., 1998). Ethi-cally, it is important to involve the community that is being studied \u2014 informed individual consent does not seem sufficient when interventionsinvolve the needs, aspirations, and even the future of communities. A significant amount of public health research has been conceived and conducted from its inception and at every stage of implementation withoutthe involvement of the community or population most affected. This ap-proach has contributed to community distrust of academic researchers andtheir projects. Additionally, research undertaken without the involvementCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html200 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH of those most affected not only may make it more difficult to develop and implement effective interventions for improvements in the health of thecommunity but may also raise ethical questions (see Box 4 -6). Further- more, research has typically adhered to a scientific paradigm of objectivityand \"universal \" truth, whereas the issues, dynamics, and stories of commu- nities are generally local, subjective, and unique (Schwab and Syme, 1997).This tension between the nature of the community and the nature of sciencemay help explain why researching the effectiveness of community coalitionsand community intervention has been a complicated endeavor and whyinvestment in community-based research has been limited. Community-based participatory research seeks to overcome some of the criticisms and distrust of academic research by emphasizing the partici-pation and influence of nonacademic researchers in the process of creatingknowledge (Israel et al., 1998). However, community members are fre-quently skeptical that proposed research efforts will be truly collaborativein nature. The promise of community-based participatory research bringswith it the need to establish true partnerships with equal decision-makingauthority, mutual benefit, and shared responsibility. Major issues that mustbe confronted in such research include power and control, conflicts overfunding, and who will be recognized as the community representative.Additionally, according to Israel and colleagues (1998), \"emphasis needs to be placed on developing norms and ways of operating that promote under-standing and demonstrate sensitivity and competence in working with di-verse cultures. \" All of these factors lead to the need for a well-developed review of ethical issues involved in community-based research and an ongo-BOX 4 -6 Community Perspectives on Research A qualitative study by public health researchers and community members in Seattle, Washington, uncovered mostly negative community perceptions of theresearch conducted in their communities. Respondents noted a power imbalance between researchers and community members and described researchers as fo- cused solely on community needs and things to be fixed. They also expressed alack of trust in their relationship with researchers and a perception that researchers did not respect the community and were impatient for results (Sullivan et al., 2001: 137). There is \"so much rhetoric around this whole issue of community-based [research], it takes an enormous amount of investment of time and energy and expertise and skill and patience in getting the foundation laid properly. . . . [Y]ou spend . . . three or four years, and a lot of funding institutions would probably gofaint at that, but it really does take that kind of effort \" (Sullivan et al., 2001: 139).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The committee believes that dis-cussion and debate about the ethics of community-based research are neces-sary and that creating a forum for such dialogue is important. Because the community is a complex and dynamic subject, the commit- tee agrees with those who assert that entirely new paradigms of researchand analysis must be developed, along with a \"postmodern epidemiology \" or a \"participatory eco-epidemiology \" that does not sacrifice rigor but that shares power and involves all local perspectives and opinions (Schwab andSyme, 1997). Collaborative public health research that engages the commu-nity at every possible level may mean that research will be applicable anduseful to them (Israel et al., 1998; Sullivan et al., 2001). Furthermore, theexpertise of local community members and groups would constitute a valu-able addition to a research project 's assets (Omenn, 1999; Schwab and Syme, 1997). A social marketing project to improve the health of agricultural work- ers in Florida provides an example of a fruitful partnership in community-based research (Flocks et al., 2001). Florida nursery and fernery workers,who are primarily Hispanic and Haitian, are exposed through their work toa large volume of pesticides known to be harmful to humans. In 1997,health researchers from the University of Florida entered into a partnershipwith a union, the Farmworker Association of Florida, and a social market-ing firm for a project to help expand existing educational efforts and focusthem into an effective, wide-scale intervention. Fernery employees partici-pated at all stages of the research, contributing valuable cultural and occu-pational insights and information. The process has been lengthy and chal-lenging because of the varied interests of the parties involved (workers,unions, health care providers, industry, academia, government agencies),but the initial work has begun to pay off. More funding has been secured,additional research has been launched, and work has begun on social mar-keting interventions to change employer practices and worker behaviorsand on efforts to address barriers to adequate health care for this vulnerablepopulation of workers exposed to environmental hazards (Flocks et al.,2001; L. Clarke, personal communication, April 9, 2002). Additional discussion of issues in community-based research and the benefits of academic collaboration with communities appears in Chapter 8,which focuses on the role of academia in the public health system.

Communities can also develop the exper-tise and linkages needed to attract media attention to their efforts andmessages. Although specific programs may end once concrete objectives are achieved, communities and their populations are continually changing, asare their health status and the factors influencing their health. The cross-linkages that are created within communities from the pursuit of one healthgoal should be sustained and expanded or modified to respond to otherpersistent or emerging needs. Under what circumstances are health improvement efforts most likely to continue? Institutional and community memories are replete with ex-amples of community initiatives that came and left without much effect,projects that accomplished little, and great collective disappointments aboutsquandered promises and resources (Mitchell and Shortell, 2000; Lasker etal., 2001). It is important to recognize that opposition and conflict aredefinite possibilities and to appreciate that small wins along the way interms of program goals can be important in sustaining interest and commit-ment (Fawcett, 1999). Success appears to be the result of a synergisticblending of community capacity with the capacity of governmental publichealth agencies and other partners (NACCHO, 2000a; Becnel, 2001; Laskeret al., 2001; McHugh et al., 2001). Capacity describes the mix of conditions (e.g., shared values, quality of programs and strategies, program congruence with community needs, andpolitical support) and resources (e.g., knowledge, skills, money, time, andtechnical assistance) necessary for communities and community coalitionsto accomplish and sustain change (Blackwell and Colmenar, 2000; Chaskinet al., 2001; Foster-Fishman et al., 2001; Norton et al., 2002). For example,a community can develop capacity by expanding its knowledge about bestpractices for organizing coalitions, planning programs, or conducting advo-cacy. Additionally, governmental public health agencies are increasinglyaware of the need to build their own capacity by enhancing their ability toprovide technical assistance, training, and support to build capable commu-nities (Howat et al., 2001; Norton et al., 2002). Local health departmentstaff generally possess the knowledge and resources needed in thecommunity 's efforts to assess local health status, assets, and needs and to evaluate the outcomes of health initiatives. The fact that communities mayrely on health departments to provide technical assistance underscores theneed to enhance the skills and knowledge of the public health workforce(discussed in greater detail in the Chapter 8). The committee recommends that local governmental public health agencies support community-led ef-forts to inventory resources, assess needs, formulate collaborative responses,and evaluate outcomes for community health improvement and the elimi-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Governmental public health agencies should provide community organizations and coalitions with technical assistanceand support in identifying and securing resources as needed and at allphases of the process. The sustainability of health improvement efforts is reflected in the extent of community change and the degree to which initiatives remain inplace after funding ends (Paine-Andrews et al., 2000b). A study of sixcommunity initiatives, three for teen pregnancy and three for substanceabuse prevention, found that after the end of a 5-year grant period, at leasta quarter of the activities initiated in each of the six projects were continu-ing. These activities included mentoring programs and an annual youth jobfair, as well as alternative activities (Paine-Andrews et al., 2000b). Amongthe strategies for sustainability of initiatives identified by the study weregrant writing, making a business plan, and integrating programs or indi-vidual program components into the regularly budgeted activities of a part-ner agency (Paine-Andrews et al., 2000b). Governmental and private-sector funders can play an essential role in supporting the sustainability of changes in a community 's conditions for health. Funders can encourage communities to develop clear goals and tofollow practices proven to be effective (W. K. Kellogg Foundation, 1997;Wickizer et al., 1998) (see Box 4 -7). For example, funders can require or support the adoption of specific program elements, such as the development of a business plan, and they can BOX 4 -7 Lessons from Turning Point A review of the Turning Point initiative identified five key lessons for public health policy: Recognize the need for direct and explicit support for partnerships; Move beyond hierarchical top -down approaches to allow direct investments in communities and responses to community priorities; Integrate community-based partnerships into program and funding strate- gies; Broaden the education of the public health workforce to include communi- cation and facilitation skills in nongovernmental and even nonhealth issues;and Model interagency and public -private integration at the federal and state levels.

Communicating or even partnering with local health de-partments may help prevent duplication of effort and may help coordinateactivities with multiple participants. In addition, funders must realize thatsignificant community change projects require long-term support and, of-ten, active assistance in identifying continuing sources of financing whenthe initial grants expire. Because of the time lag between initiation of acommunity-level intervention and measurable health results, short-term\"demonstration project \" models are rarely effective and may increase com- munity cynicism about outside partners. The committee recommends that governmental and private-sector funders of community health initiativesplan their investments with a focus on long-lasting change. Such a focuswould include realistic time lines, an emphasis on ongoing communityengagement and leadership, and a final goal of institutionalizing effectiveproject components in the local community or public health system asappropriate. Given the ever-changing nature of communities, health improvement ef- forts should be seen as a continuing journey rather than a specific destination. CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS Communities and community organizations can be vital contributors to the resources and capacity of a public health system. A community 's right to self-determination, its knowledge of local needs and circumstances,and its human, social, and cultural assets, including the linkages amongindividuals, businesses, congregations, civic groups, schools, and innumer-able others, are all important motivations for community health action. Incases in which community health promotion and protection activities areinitiated by a health department or an organization, engaging the commu-nity is a primary responsibility. Realizing the vision of healthy people in healthy communities is possible only if the community, in its full cultural, social, and economic diversity, is an authentic partner in changing theconditions for health.

In consid-ering the role of the health care sector in assuring the nation's health, thecommittee took as its starting point one of the recommendations of theInstitute of Medicine (IOM) report Crossing the Quality Chasm (2001b: 6): \"All health care organizations, professional groups, and private and publicpurchasers should adopt as their explicit purpose to continually reduce theburden of illness, injury, and disability, and to improve the health andfunctioning of the people of the United States.\" This chapter addresses the issues of access, managing chronic disease, neglected health care services (i.e., clinical preventive services, oral, andmental health care and substance abuse services), and the capacity of thehealth care delivery system to better serve the population in terms of cul-tural competence, quality, the workforce, financing, information technol-ogy, and emergency preparedness. In addition, the chapter discusses theresponsibility of the health care system to recognize and play its appropri-ate role within the intersectoral public health system, particularly as itcollaborates with the governmental public health agencies. The health care sector in the United States consists of an array of clinicians, hospitals and other health care facilities, insurance plans, andpurchasers of health care services, all operating in various configurations ofgroups, networks, and independent practices. Some are based in the publicsector; others operate in the private sector as either for-profit or not-for-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM 213 profit entities. The health care sector also includes regulators, some volun- tary and others governmental. Although these various individuals and orga-nizations are generally referred to collectively as \"the health care delivery system, \" the phrase suggests an order, integration, and accountability that do not exist. Communication, collaboration, or systems planning amongthese various entities is limited and is almost incidental to their operations.For convenience, however, the committee uses the common terminology ofhealth care delivery system. As described in Crossing the Quality Chasm (IOM, 2001b) and other literature, this health care system is faced with serious quality and costchallenges. To support the system, the United States spends more per capitaon health care than any other country ($4,637 in 2000) (Reinhardt et al.,2002). In the aggregate, these per capita expenditures account for 13.2percent of the U.S. gross domestic product, about $1.3 trillion (Levit et al.,2002). As the committee observed in Chapter 1, American medicine and thebasic and clinical research that inform its practice are generally acknowl-edged as the best in the world. Yet the nation 's substantial health-related spending has not produced superlative health outcomes for its people. Fun-damental flaws in the systems that finance, organize, and deliver health carework to undermine the organizational structure necessary to ensure theeffective translation of scientific discoveries into routine patient care, andmany parts of the health care delivery system are economically vulnerable.Insurance plans and providers scramble to adapt and survive in a rapidlyevolving and highly competitive market; and the variations among healthinsurance plans \u2014whether public or private \u2014in eligibility, benefits, cost sharing, plan restrictions, reimbursement policies, and other attributes cre-ate confusion, inequity, and excessive administrative burdens for both pro-viders of care and consumers. Because of its history, structure, and particularly the highly competitive market in health services that has evolved since the collapse of health carereform efforts in the early 1990s, the health care delivery system often doesnot interact effectively with other components of the public health systemdescribed in this report, in particular, the governmental public health agen-cies. Health care 's structure and incentives are technology and procedure driven and do not support time for the inquiry and reflection, communica-tion, and external relationship building typically needed for effective dis-ease prevention and health promotion. State health departments often havelegal authority to regulate the entry of providers and purchasers of healthcare into the market and to set insurance reimbursement rates for publicand, less often, private providers and purchasers. They may control theability of providers to acquire desired technology and perform complex,costly procedures that are important to the hospital but increase demandson state revenues. Finally, virtually all states have the legal responsibility toCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Many health care providers argue that such regulation adds to theircosts, and high-profile problems can create additional tensions that impedecollaboration between the state public health agency and the health caredelivery system. Furthermore, when the delivery of health care through the private sec- tor falters, the responsibility for providing some level of basic health careservices to the poor and other special populations falls to governmentalpublic health agencies as one of their essential public health services, asdiscussed in Chapter 1. In many jurisdictions, this default is already occur-ring, consuming resources and impairing the ability of governmental publichealth agencies to perform other essential tasks. Although this committee was not constituted to investigate or make recommendations regarding the serious economic and structural problemsconfronting the health care system in the United States, it concluded that itmust examine certain issues having serious implications for the public healthsystem 's effectiveness in promoting the nation 's health. Drawing heavily on the work of other IOM committees, this chapter examines the influencethat health insurance exerts on access to health care and on the range ofcare available, as well as the shortcomings in the quality of services pro-vided, some of the constraints on the capacity of the health care system toprovide high-quality care, and the need for better collaboration within thepublic health system, especially among governmental public health agenciesand the organizations in the personal health care delivery system. ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE Health care is not the only, or even the strongest, determinant of health, but it is very important. For most Americans, having health insurance \u2014 under a private plan or through a publicly financed program \u2014is a thresh- old requirement for routine access to health care. \"Health insurance cover- age is associated with better health outcomes for adults. It is also associatedwith having a regular source of care and with greater and more appropriateuse of health services. These factors, in turn, improve the likelihood ofdisease screening and early detection, the management of chronic illness,and the effective treatment of acute conditions, \" IOM notes in a recent report (IOM, 2002a: 6). Private insurance is predominantly purchased through employment- based groups and to a lesser extent through individual policies (Mills,2002). Publicly funded insurance is provided primarily through seven gov-ernment programs (see Table 5 -1). Medicare provides coverage to 13.5 percent of the population, whereas Medicaid covers 11.2 percent of thepopulation (Mills, 2002). Additionally, public funding supports directlyCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM 215 delivered health care (through community health centers and other health centers qualified for Medicaid reimbursement) accessed by 11 percent ofthe nation 's uninsured, who constitute 41 percent of patients at such health centers (Markus et al., 2002). Because the largest public programs aredirected to the aged, disabled, and low-income populations, they cover adisproportionate share of the chronically ill and disabled. However, theyare also enormously important for children. In early 2001, Medicaid andthe State Children 's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) provided health care coverage to 23.1 percent of the children in the United States, and thisfigure had risen to 27.7 percent according to data from the first-quarterestimates in the National Health Interview Survey (NCHS, 2002). Being uninsured, although not the only barrier to obtaining health care, is by all indications the most significant one. The fact that more than 41million people \u2014more than 80 percent of whom are members of working families \u2014are uninsured is the strongest possible indictment of the nation 's health care delivery system. Those without health insurance or withoutinsurance for particular types of services face serious, sometimes insur-mountable barriers to necessary and appropriate care.TABLE 5 -1 Government Health Programs Program Year Enrollment Expenditures Medicare 2001 40 million aged and disabled $242.4 billionh individualsa Medicaid 2002 47 million 4.3 million veteransd$21 million American Indians and $3.2 billione Alaska Nativese DOD 2001 8.4 billionf TRICARE of the militaryf FEHBP $20 billiong retireesg NOTE: VHA = Veterans DOD = De- partment of Defense; FEHBP = Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.

Children without health insurance may be compromised in waysthat will diminish their health and productivity throughout their lives. When individuals cannot access mainstream health care services, they often seek care from the so-called safety-net providers. These providersinclude institutions and professionals that by mandate or mission deliver alarge amount of care to uninsured and other vulnerable populations. Peopleturn to safety-net providers for a variety of reasons: some because they lackhealth insurance and others because there are no other providers in the areawhere they live or because language and cultural differences make themuncomfortable with mainstream care. Safety-net providers are also morelikely to offer outreach and enabling services (e.g., transportation and childcare) to help overcome barriers that may not be directly related to thehealth care system itself. In this section, the committee reviews concerns about the barriers to health care that are raised by the lack of health insurance and by threats tothe nation 's safety-net providers. The Uninsured and the Underinsured The persistently large proportion of the American population that is uninsured \u2014about one in five working-age adults and one in seven children \u2014 is the most visible and troubling sign of the nation 's failure to assure access to health care. Yet the public and many elected officials seem almost willfullyignorant of the magnitude, persistence, and implications of this problem.Surveys conducted over the past two decades show a consistent underestima-tion of the number of uninsured and of trends in insurance coverage overtime (Blendon et al., 2001). The facts about uninsurance in America aresobering (see Box 5 -1). By almost any metric, uninsured adults suffer worse health status and live shorter lives than insured adults (IOM, 2002a). Because insurance status affects access to secure and continuous care, it also affects health, leading to an estimated 18,000 premature deaths annually(IOM, 2002a). Having a regular source of care improves chances of receivingpersonal preventive care and screening services and improves the manage-ment of chronic disease. When risk factors, such as high blood pressure, canbe identified and treated, the chances of developing conditions such as heartdisease can be reduced. Similarly, if diseases can be detected and treated whenthey are still in their early stages, subsequent rates of morbidity and mortalitycan often be reduced. Without insurance, the chances of early detection andtreatment of risk factors or disease are low.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM 217 However, even when the uninsured receive care, they fare less well than the insured. The IOM Committee on the Consequences of Uninsurancefound that \"[u]ninsured adults receive health services that are less adequate and appropriate than those received by patients who have either public orprivate health insurance, and they have poorer clinical outcomes and pooreroverall health than do adults with private health insurance \" (IOM, 2002a: 87). For example, Hadley and colleagues (1991) found that uninsured adulthospital inpatients had a significantly higher risk of dying in the hospitalthan their privately insured counterparts. Emergency and trauma care werealso found to vary for insured and uninsured patients. Uninsured personswith traumatic injuries were less likely to be admitted to the hospital,BOX 5-1 Findings from Coverage Matters In its report Coverage Matters , the IOM Committee on the Consequences of Uninsurance (IOM, 2001a) found the following: Forty-two million people in the United States lacked health insurance coverage in 1999 (Mills, 2000). This number represented about 15 percent of the totalpopulation of 274 million persons at that time and 17 percent of the population younger than 65 years of age; 10 million of the uninsured are children under the age of 18 (about 14 percent of all children), and about 32 million are adultsbetween the ages of 18 and 65 (about 19 percent of all adults in this age group). Nearly 3 out of every 10 Americans, more than 70 million people, lacked health insurance for at least a month over a 36-month period. These numbers are greater than the combined populations of Texas, California, and Connecticut. More than 80 percent of uninsured children and adults under the age of 65 lived in working families. Contrary to popular belief, recent immigrants accounted for a relatively small proportion of the uninsured (less than one in five). Insurance status is a powerful determinant of access to care: people without insurance generally have reduced access. Research consistently finds that per- sons without insurance are less likely to have any physician visits within a year, have fewer visits annually, and are less likely to have a regular source of care.Children without insurance are three times more likely than children with Med- icaid coverage to have no regular source of care. The uninsured were less likely to receive health care services, even for serious conditions. Research consistently finds that persons without insurance are less likely to have any physician visits within a year, have fewer visits annually, and are less likely to have a regular source of care (15 percent of uninsured chil-dren do not have a regular provider, whereas just 5 percent of children with Medicaid do not have a regular provider), and uninsured adults are more than three times as likely to lack a regular source of care.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html218 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH received fewer services when admitted, and were more likely to die than insured trauma victims (Hadley et al., 1991). For children, too, being uninsured tends to reduce access to health care and is associated with poorer health. The 1998 IOM report America 's Children: Health Insurance and Access to Care found that uninsured chil- dren \"are more likely to be sick as newborns, less likely to be immunized as preschoolers, less likely to receive medical treatment when they are injured,and less likely to receive treatment for illness such as acute or recurrent earinfections, asthma and tooth decay \" (IOM, 1998: 3). That report empha- sized that untreated health problems can affect children 's physical and emotional growth, development, and overall health and well-being. Un-treated ear infections, for example, can have permanent consequences ofhearing loss or deafness. Even when insured, limitations on coverage may still impede people 's access to care. Many people who are counted as insured have very limitedbenefits and are exposed to high out-of-pocket expenses or service restric-tions. Three areas in which benefits are frequently circumscribed underboth public and private insurance plans are preventive services, behavioralhealth care (treatment of mental illness and addictive disorders), and oralhealth care. When offered, coverage for these services often carries limitsthat are unrelated to treatment needs and are stricter than those for othertypes of care (King, 2000). Cost-sharing requirements for these servicesmay also be higher than those for other commonly covered services. (Addi-tional discussion of these and other \"neglected \" forms of care appears later in this chapter.) Access to care for the insured can also be affected by requirements for cost sharing and copayments. Cost sharing is an effective means to reducethe use of health care for trivial or self-limited conditions. Numerous stud-ies, starting with the RAND Health Insurance Experiment, show thatcopayments also reduce the use of preventive and primary care services bythe poor, although not by higher-income groups (Solanki et al., 2000). Thesame effects have been shown for the use of behavioral health care services(Wells et al., 2000). As a result of the nation 's increased awareness of bioterrorist threats, there are concerns about the implications of copayments and other finan-cial barriers to health care. Cost sharing may discourage early care seeking,impeding infectious disease surveillance, delaying timely diagnosis and treat-ment, and posing a threat to the health of the public. The committee en-courages health care policy makers in the public and private sectors toreexamine these issues in light of the concerns about bioterrorism. This committee was not constituted to make specific recommendations about health insurance. The issues are complex, and the failures of healthCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM 219 care reform efforts over the past 30 years testify to the difficulty of crafting a solution. However, the committee finds that both the scale of the problemand the strong evidence of adverse health effects from being uninsured orunderinsured make a compelling case that the health of the American peopleas a whole is compromised by the absence of insurance coverage for somany. Assuring the health of the population in the twenty-first centuryrequires finding a means to guarantee insurance coverage for every personliving in this country. Adequate population health cannot be achieved without making com- prehensive and affordable health care available to every person residing inthe United States. It is the responsibility of the federal government to lead anational effort to examine the options available to achieve stable healthcare coverage of individuals and families and to assure the implementationof plans to achieve that result. Safety-Net Providers Absent the availability of health insurance, the role of the safety-net provider is critically important. Increasing their numbers and assuring theirviability can, to some degree, improve the availability of care. The IOMCommittee on the Changing Market, Managed Care and the Future Viabil-ity of Safety Net Providers defined safety-net providers as \"[t]hose provid- ers that organize and deliver a significant level of health care and otherhealth-related services to uninsured, Medicaid, and other vulnerable pa-tients \" (IOM, 2000a: 21). That committee further identified core safety-net providers as having two distinguishing characteristics: \"(1) by legal man- date or explicitly adopted mission they maintain an 'open door, ' offering access to services to patients regardless of their ability to pay; and (2) asubstantial share of their patient mix is uninsured, Medicaid, and othervulnerable patients \" (IOM, 2000a: 3). The organization and delivery of safety-net services vary widely from state to state and community to community (Baxter and Mechanic, 1997).The safety net consists of public hospital systems; academic health centers;community health centers or clinics funded by federal, state, and local gov-ernmental public health agencies (see Chapter 3); and local health depart-ments themselves (although systematic data on the extent of health depart-ment services are lacking) (IOM, 2000a). A recent study of changes in thecapacities and roles of local health departments as safety-net providers found,however, that more than a quarter of the health departments surveyed werethe sole safety-net providers in their jurisdictions and that this was morelikely to be the case in smaller jurisdictions (Keane et al., 2001). Safety-net service providers, which include local and state governmen-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html220 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH tal agencies, contribute to the public health system in multiple ways. Ser- vices provided by state and local governments often include mental healthhospitals and outpatient clinics, substance abuse treatment programs, ma-ternal and child health services, and clinics for the homeless. In addition, anestimated 1,300 public hospitals nationwide (Legnini et al., 1999) providefree care to those without insurance or resources to pay. A survey of 69hospitals belonging to the National Association of Public Hospitals indi-cated that in 1997, public hospitals provided more than 23 percent of thenation 's uncompensated hospital care (measured as the sum of bad debt and charity care) (IOM, 2000a). These demands can overwhelm the tradi-tional population-oriented mission of the governmental public health agen-cies. Furthermore, changes in the funding streams or reimbursement poli-cies for any of these programs or increases in demand for free or subsidizedcare that inevitably occur in periods of economic downturn create crises forsafety-net providers, including those operated by state and local govern-ments (see the section Collaboration with Governmental Public HealthAgencies later in this chapter for additional discussion). The IOM committee that produced the report America 's Health Care Safety Net: Intact but Endangered (IOM, 2000a: 205 -206) had the follow- ing findings: Despite today 's robust economy, safety net providers \u2014especially core safety net providers \u2014are being buffeted by the cumulative and concur- rent effects of major health policy and market changes. The convergence and potentially adverse consequences of these new and powerful dynam- ics lead the committee to be highly concerned about the future viabilityof the safety net. Although safety net providers have proven to be both resilient and resourceful, the committee believes that many providers may be unable to survive the current environment. Taken alone, thegrowth in Medicaid managed care enrollment; the retrenchment or elim- ination of key direct and indirect subsidies that providers have relied upon to help finance uncompensated care; and the continued growth inthe number of uninsured people would make it difficult for many safety net providers to survive. Taken together, these trends are beginning to place unparalleled strain on the health care safety net in many parts ofthe country. . . . The committee believes that the effects of these com- bined forces and dynamics demand the immediate attention of public policy officials. (IOM, 2000a: 206) The committee fully endorses the recommendations from America 's Health Care Safety Net: Intact but Endangered (IOM, 2000a), aimed at ensuring the continued viability of the health care safety net (see Box 5 -2).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM 221 NEGLECTED CARE The committee is concerned that the specific types of care that are important for population health \u2014clinical preventive services, mental health care, treatment for substance abuse, and oral health care \u2014are less available because of the current organization and financing of health care services.Many forms of publicly or privately purchased health insurance providelimited coverage, and sometimes no coverage, for these services. Clinical Preventive Services The evidence that insurance makes a difference in health outcomes is well documented for preventive, screening, and chronic disease care (IOM,2002b). Clinical preventive services are the \"medical procedures, tests or counseling that health professionals deliver in a clinical setting to preventdisease and promote health, as opposed to interventions that respond topatient symptoms or complaints \" (Partnership for Prevention, 1999: 3). Such services include immunizations and screening tests, as well as counsel-ing aimed at changing the personal health behaviors of patients long beforeBOX 5 -2 Recommendations Concerning Safety-Net Services 1. Federal and state policy makers should explicitly take into account and address the full impact (both intended and unintended) of changes in Medicaid policieson the viability of safety-net providers and the populations they serve. 2. All federal programs and policies targeted to support the safety net and the populations it serves should be reviewed for their effectiveness in meeting theneeds of the uninsured. 3. Concerted efforts should be directed to improving this nation 's capacity and ability to monitor the changing structure, capacity, and financial stability of thesafety net to meet the health care needs of the uninsured and other vulnerable populations. 4. Given the growing number of uninsured people, the adverse effects of Medic- aid managed care on safety-net provider revenues, and the absence of con- certed public policies directed at increasing the rate of insurance coverage, the committee believes that a new targeted federal initiative should be establishedto help support core safety-net providers that care for a disproportionate num- ber of uninsured and other vulnerable people.

The importance of counseling and behavioral interventions is evident, given the influence on health of factors such astobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use; unsafe sexual behavior; and lack ofexercise and poor diets. These risk behaviors are estimated to account formore than half of all premature deaths; smoking alone contributes to oneout of five deaths (McGinnis and Foege, 1993). Coverage of clinical preventive services has increased steadily over the past decade. In 1988, about three-quarters of adults with employment-based health insurance had a benefit package that included adult physicalexaminations. Two years later, the proportion had risen to 90 percent (Riceet al., 1998; Kaiser Family Foundation and Health Research and Educa-tional Trust, 2000). The type of health plan is the most important predictorof coverage (RWJF, 2001). The use of financial incentives and data-drivenperformance measurement strategies to improve physicians ' delivery of ser- vices such as immunizations (IOM, 2002c) may account for the fact thatmanaged care plans tend to offer the most comprehensive coverage ofclinical preventive services and traditional indemnity plans tend to offer theleast comprehensive coverage. Although the trend toward inclusion of clinical preventive services is positive, such benefits are still limited in scope and are not well correlatedwith evidence regarding the effectiveness of individual services. The U.S.Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), a panel of experts convened bythe U.S. Public Health Service, has endorsed a core set of clinical preventiveservices for asymptomatic individuals with no known risk factors. In thecommittee 's view, this guidance to clinicians on the services that should be offered to specific patients should also inform the design of insurance plansfor coverage of age-appropriate services. However, the USPSTF recommen-dations have had relatively little influence on the design of insurance ben-efits, and recommended counseling and screening services are often notcovered and, consequently, not used (Partnership for Prevention, 2001) (seeBox 5 -3). As might be expected, though, adults without health insurance are the least likely to receive recommended preventive and screening ser-vices or to receive them at the recommended frequencies (Ayanian et al.,2000). Having any health insurance, even without coverage for any preventive services, increases the probability that an individual will receive appropri-ate preventive care (Hayward et al., 1988; Woolhandler and Himmelstein,1988; Hsia et al., 2000). Studies of the use of preventive services by Hispan-ics and African Americans find that health insurance is strongly associatedwith the increased receipt of preventive services (Solis et al., 1990;Mandelblatt et al., 1999; Zambrana et al., 1999; Wagner and Guendelman,2000; Breen et al., 2001; O 'Malley et al., 2001). However, the higher rates of uninsurance among racial and ethnic minorities contribute significantlyCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM 223 to their reduced overall likelihood of receiving clinical preventive services and to their poorer clinical outcomes (Haas and Adler, 2001). For example,African Americans and members of other minority groups who are diag-nosed with cancer are more likely to be diagnosed at advanced stages ofdisease than are whites (Farley and Flannery, 1989; Mandelblatt et al.,1991, 1996; Wells and Horm, 1992). Medicare Coverage of Preventive Services Preventive services are important for older adults, for whom they can reduce premature morbidity and mortality, help preserve function, andenhance quality of life. Unfortunately, the Medicare program was not de-signed with a focus on prevention, and the process for adding preventiveservices to the Medicare benefit package is complex and difficult. Unlikeforms of treatment that are incorporated into the payment system on arelatively routine basis as they come into general use, preventive services aresubject to a greater degree of scrutiny and a demand for a higher level ofeffectiveness, and there is no routine process for making such assessments.Box 5 -4 lists the preventive services currently covered by Medicare. The level of use of preventive services among older adults has been relatively low (CDC, 1998). This may reflect the limited range of benefitscovered by Medicare, as well as other barriers such as copayments, partici-pants ' unfamiliarity with the services, or the failure of physicians to recom-BOX 5 -3 Partnership for Prevention Survey of Employer Support for Preventive Services Counseling to address serious health risks \u2014tobacco use, physical inactivity, risky drinking, poor nutrition \u2014is least likely to be covered by an employer- sponsored health plan. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force calls these interventions \"vitally important. \" Nearly 90 percent of employers ' most popular plans cover well-baby care, whereas less than half cover contraceptive devices or drugs to prevent unwant- ed births. Yet about half of all pregnancies and nearly a third of all births eachyear are unintended. One out of five employer-sponsored plans does not cover childhood immuniza- tions, and one out of four does not cover adolescent immunizations althoughthese are among the most cost-effective preventive services.

Cardiovascular disease and diabetes exemplify the problem. Although cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and diabetesis one of the most significant chronic diseases affecting Medicare beneficia-ries, physicians cannot screen for lipids disorders or diabetes unless thepatient agrees to pay out-of-pocket for the tests. Medicaid Coverage of Preventive Services Medicaid benefits vary by state in terms of both the individuals who are eligible for coverage and the actual services for which coverage is provided.The exception is preventive services for children. In 1976, the U.S. Congressadded the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT)program to the federal Medicaid program. This entitled poor children to acomprehensive package of preventive health care and medically necessarydiagnostic and treatment services. In 1996, 22.9 million children (20 per-cent of the nation 's children) were eligible for EPSDT benefits. Given its potential to reach such a high proportion of the nation 's neediest children, the program could have a very positive, widespread impact on children 's health. Unfortunately, data on the program 's progress are incomplete and inconsistent across the country, despite federal requirements for state re-ports (GAO, 2001a). However, some studies have demonstrated thatEPSDT has never been fully implemented, and the percentage of childrenreceiving preventive care through it remains low for reasons ranging fromBOX 5 -4 Preventive Services Covered by Medicare For individuals with Medicare, the following services are covered by Medicare Part B: Bone mass measurements for people at risk of losing bone mass Colorectal cancer screening (people age 50 and older) Diabetes services (coverage of self-management training and glucose monitor- ing supplies) for people with diabetes Mammogram screening (women age 40 and older) Pap test and pelvic examination (women) Prostate cancer screening (men age 50 and older) Vaccinations (flu, pneumococcal pneumonia, hepatitis B) Outpatient nutrition counseling by registered dietitians for patients with diabe- tes and some types of kidney disease SOURCE: HCFA (2001).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Of the 22.9 million childreneligible for EPSDT in 1996, only 37 percent received a medical screeningprocedure through the program (Olson, 1998) (see Box 5 -5). Additionally, data show that as many as 50 percent of children who have an EPSDT visitare identified as requiring medical attention, but if they are referred forfollow-up care, only one-third to two-thirds go for their referral visit(Rosenbach and Gavin, 1998). Mental Health Care The Surgeon General 's report on mental illness (DHHS, 1999) esti- mates that more than one in five adults are affected by mental disorders inany given year (see Box 5 -6) and 5.4 percent of all adults have a serious mental illness. Data for children are less reliable, but the overall prevalenceof mental disorders is also estimated to be about 20 percent (DHHS, 1999).Mental disorders are a major public health issue because they affect such alarge proportion of the population, have implications for other health prob-lems, and impose high costs, both financial and emotional, on affectedindividuals and their families. The cost to society is also high, with indirectcosts from lost productivity for affected individuals and their caretakersestimated at $79 billion in 1990, the last year for which estimates areavailable (Rice and Miller, 1996). For the most prevalent mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety, receipt of appropriate care is associated with improved functionaloutcomes at 2 years (Sturm et al., 1995), but the majority of individualssuffering from mental illness are not treated for their condition (DHHS,1999). Access to care is constrained by limitations on insurance coveragethat are greater than those imposed for other diseases. Annual and lifetimecoverage limits are frequently less, and mental health coverage often hasmore hidden costs in the forms of copayments and higher deductibles(Zuvekas et al., 1998). Table 5 -2 shows the distribution of sources of payment for treatment for mental health and addictive disorders in 1996.Additionally, those with no insurance all year paid nearly 60 percent ofcosts out-of-pocket, whereas those with some private insurance paid 40percent of costs out-of-pocket in 1996 (Zuvekas, 2001). Adults ' use of mental health services in both the general and the spe- cialty mental health sectors correlates highly with health insurance cover-age (Cooper-Patrick et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2000; Young et al., 2001),and health insurance coverage specifically for mental health services isassociated with an increased likelihood of receiving such care (Wang et al.,Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Be- tween 1991 and 1996, the number of children eligible for the Early and Peri-odic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treat- ment (EPSDT) program increased by roughly 5.7 million, with the highestnumber (23.5 million children) occur- ring in 1995. The number of eligible children fell by more than half a millionbetween 1995 and 1996. Medical screening . Of the 22.9 mil- lion children eligible for the EPSDT program in 1996, only 37 percent re- ceived a medical screen through theEPSDT program. The medical screen- ing rate is not adjusted according to the federal periodicity schedule or theaverage period of eligibility, but instead reports the percentage of children who were eligible for any period of time dur-ing fiscal year 1996 and who received one or more medical screens. Young children were significantly more likelyto be screened: 76 percent of infants under age 1 were screened in 1996, whereas 18 percent of adolescentsages 15 to 20 were screened in 1996.

The partici- pant rate \u2014the number of children screened compared to the number of children expected to be screened,based on the federal periodicity sched- ule and the average period of eligibili- ty\u2014increased from 51 percent in 1994 to 56 percent in 1996. In 1990, the Health Care Financing Administration established a participant rate goal of80 percent, to be achieved by fiscal year 1995. As of fiscal year 1996, only nine states reported meeting or ex-ceeding the federally established goal. SOURCE: Adapted from Olson et al.

Recent studies have shown impressive results for treatment of depression in primary care settings (Sturm and Wells, 2000;Schoenbaum et al., 2001). The provision of such services is cost-effectiveand comparable to the cost-effectiveness of other common procedures.However, reimbursement policies for primary care do not support the ser-vices necessary to provide evidence-based care for depression (Wells et al.,2000; Schoenbaum et al., 2001). Adults with either no insurance coverage or coverage that excludes or limits extended treatment of mental illness receive less appropriate care andmay experience delays in receiving services until they gain public insurance(Rabinowitz et al., 2001). Adults with mental disorders are also more likelyto lose health insurance coverage within a year following their diagnosisthan those without a mental disorder (Sturm and Wells, 2000). The limited and unstable nature of insurance for treatment of mental illness has several implications for governmental public health agenciesbecause the severely mentally ill are likely to end up receiving care inpublicly funded safety-net programs (Rabinowitz et al., 2001). Funding tosupport the public mental health system comes from reimbursements forBOX 5 -6 Facts About Mental Illness About 40 million people (more than one in five) ages 18 to 64 are estimated to have a single mental disorder of any severity or both a mental and an addictivedisorder in a given year (Regier et al., 1993; Kessler et al., 1994). The most common conditions fall into the broad categories of schizophrenia, affective disorders (including major depression and bipolar or manic-depres-sive illness), and anxiety disorders (e.g., panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and phobia). Schizophrenia affects at least an estimated 2 million Americans in any year (Regier et al., 1993), whereas the most prevalent affective disorder, major de- pression, has been reported to occur in 6.5 percent of women and 3.3 percent of men in any year (DHHS, 2000a). Manic-depressive illness is reported toexist in 1 percent of adults. Anxiety disorders affect an estimated 19 million Americans annually (DHHS, 2000a). Only 25 percent of people who have a mental disorder obtain diagnosis and treatment from the health care system, in contrast to 60 to 80 percent of those with heart disease (DHHS, 2000a).

Taken in the aggregate, these fundingstreams are neither adequate nor reliable enough to meet the needs ofindividuals with serious mental disorders (IOM, 2000a). As with otherforms of safety-net care, the urgency of providing treatment to the severelymentally ill erodes funds available for prevention purposes. Treatment for Substance Abuse In the United States, more than 18 million people who use alcohol and nearly 5 million who use illicit drugs need substance abuse treatment(SAMHSA, 2001). Substance abuse, like mental illness, exacts enormoussocial costs across all segments of society. The total social costs of alcoholabuse alone were estimated at $177.3 billion in 1997 (Coffey et al., 2001).In that same year, $6.4 billion was spent on treatment. Total spending ondrug abuse treatment equaled $5.5 billion in that year, compared withestimated social costs of drug abuse of $116.9 billion. Most recipients (87 percent) of specialty treatment for alcohol or drug abuse receive it in outpatient settings (RWJF, 2001), but overall, less thanone-fourth of those who need treatment get it. Barriers to treatment includestigma, lack of available treatment facilities, unwillingness to admit thattreatment is needed, and inability to pay for care. Public sources providemore than two-thirds of the funding for alcohol and drug treatment facilities.Half of such funds come from dedicated funding at the federal, state, andlocal levels in the form of various block grants to state safety-net programs.TABLE 5 -2 Distribution (percent) of Sources of Payment for Mental Health/Substance Abuse Treatment, by Type of Use, 1996 Payment Ambulatory Psychotropic Inpatient Source Total Care Medications Care Total Out-of-pocket 23.0 32.4 39.1** \u2014a Private 39.4 34.3 42.1** 19.6 aRelative standard error is too large to support reliable estimation. *p < .10 ** p < .05 SOURCE: Zuvekas (2001), based on the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Another 5 percent is covered through various charitable sources. Insurance policies held by many individuals constrain the use of sub- stance abuse services by the exclusion of benefits for such services and bythe use of annual and lifetime limits on benefits and other controls onservice utilization. Between 1987 and 1997, private insurance for substanceabuse services fell 0.2 percent per year on average (inflation adjusted). Overthe same period, out-of-pocket payments for specific types of substanceabuse treatment increased (Coffey et al., 2001). However, the high out-of-pocket costs faced by individuals who pay for their own treatment discour-age many who need care from seeking it. Oral Health Care Like mental illness and addiction disorders, oral health has been ne- glected in the health care delivery system. The consequences in terms ofindividual and population health are significant \u2014oral health is a matter of public health concern because it affects a large proportion of the populationand is linked with overall health status (see Box 5 -7). Oral diseases are causally related to a range of significant health problems and chronic dis-eases, as well as individuals ' ability to succeed in school, work, and the community (DHHS, 2000b). The effects of oral diseases are cumulative andinfluence aspects of life as fundamental as the foods people can eat, theirability to communicate effectively, and their social acceptability. The prob-lems in the way the health care delivery system relates to oral health includelack of dental coverage and low coverage payments, the separation ofmedicine and dentistry in training and practice, and the high proportion ofthe population that lacks any dental insurance. The committee focused onthe problem of insurance and access to care. According to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Office of Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, more than 150 millionAmericans have limited or no dental insurance, nearly four times the num-ber who lack insurance for medical care (cited by Allukian, 1999). As withother types of health services, insurance is a strong predictor of access toand use of dental services, and minorities and low-income populations aremuch less likely to have dental insurance or to receive dental care. Individuals and families living below the poverty level experience more dental decay than higher-income groups, and their cavities are less likely tobe treated (GAO, 2000). More than a third of poor children (ages 2 to 9)have one or more primary teeth with untreated decay, compared with 17.3percent of nonpoor children (DHHS, 2000b). Mexican-American adultsand children are more likely to have untreated decayed teeth than any otherCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html230 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH population group. Poor Mexican-American children ages 2 to 9 have the highest proportion of untreated decayed teeth (70.5 percent), followed bypoor non-Hispanic African-American children (67.4 percent). The patternfor adults is similar (DHHS, 2000b: 63 -64). Medicare excludes coverage of routine dental care, and many state Medicaid programs do not provide dental coverage for eligible children oradults. According to a report of the Surgeon General, fewer than one in fiveMedicaid-covered children received a single dental visit in a recent year-long study period (DHHS, 2000b). Low-income Hispanic children andadults are less likely to be eligible for Medicaid than other groups, so eventhe limited Medicaid benefits are unlikely to be available to them. Theforecast for major oral health problems among the nation 's fastest-growing population group, Hispanics, is especially alarming. The committee found that preventive, oral health, mental health, and substance abuse treatment services must be considered part of the compre-hensive spectrum of care necessary to help assure maximum health. There-fore, the committee recommends that all public and privately funded insur- ance plans include age-appropriate preventive services as recommended byBOX 5 -7 Oral Health as a Component of Total Health When people think about the components of good health, they often forget about the importance of good oral health. This oversight is often reflected by healthinsurance coverage restrictions that exclude oral health care. Oral health is important because the condition of the mouth is often indicative of the condition of the body as a whole. More than 90 percent of systemic diseaseshave oral manifestations. These diseases include immune deficiency (e.g., HIV/ AIDS), viral diseases (e.g., herpes and mumps), cancer and leukemia, diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, anemia, hemophilia and other bleeding disorders,adrenal gland disorders, and inflammatory bowel disease (Bajuscak, 1999; Glick, 1999). Also, poor oral health can lead to poor general health. Infections in the mouth can enter the bloodstream and affect the functioning of major organs (e.g.,bacterial endocarditis, in which infection causes the lining of the heart and the heart valves to become inflamed) (Meadows, 1999). Poor oral care can also con- tribute to oral cancer, and untreated tooth decay can lead to tooth abscess, toothloss, and \u2014in the worst cases \u2014serious destruction of the jawbone (Meadows, 1999). For these reasons, oral health must recognized as an important component of assuring individual and population health. The awareness that the mouth may be a mirror to the body can help to prevent illness, diagnose serious conditions early, and maintain optimum overall health (Glick, 1999).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

PROBLEMS IN QUALITY OF CARE Crossing the Quality Chasm (IOM, 2001b) examined health system failures that compromise the quality of care provided to all Americans. Asnoted, it is often the responsibility of state departments of health to monitorproviders and levy sanctions when quality problems are identified. Thisadds to potential tensions with the public health system. Two particularquality problems have special significance in terms of assuring the health ofthe population: disparities in the quality of care provided to racial andethnic minorities and inadequate management of chronic diseases. As theAmerican population grows both older and more racially and ethnicallydiverse and as rates of chronic disease increase, important vulnerabilities inthe health care delivery system are compromising individual and popula-tion health (Murray and Lopez, 1996; Hetzel and Smith, 2001). Disparities in Health Care A principal finding from Crossing the Quality Chasm (IOM, 2001b: 53) is that \"the quality of care should not differ because of such character- istics as gender, race, age, ethnicity, income, education, disability, sexualorientation, or place of residence. \" Disparities in health care are defined as \"racial or ethnic differences in the quality of health care that are not due to access-related factors or clinical needs, preferences and appropriateness ofintervention \" (IOM, 2002b: 4). Evidence shows that racial and ethnic minorities do not receive the same quality of care afforded white Americans. These findings are consis-tent across a range of illnesses and health care services and remain evenafter adjustment for socioeconomic differences and other factors that arerelated to access to health care (IOM, 2002b). Furthermore, poor-qualityhealth care is an important independent variable contributing to lowerhealth status for minorities (IOM, 2002b). For example, racial differencesin cervical cancer deaths have increased over time, despite the greater useof screening tests by minority women (Mitchell and McCormack, 1997).The lower quality of care also compounds the adverse health effects ofother disadvantages faced by minorities, including lower incomes andeducation, less healthy living environments, and a greater likelihood ofbeing uninsured. As discussed in Unequal Treatment (IOM, 2002b), the factors that may produce disparities in health care include the role of bias, discrimination,and stereotyping at the individual (provider and patient), institution, andCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html232 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH health system levels. The report found that aspects of the health care sys- tem\u2014its organization, financing, and availability of services \u2014may have adverse effects specifically for racial and ethnic minorities. For example,time pressures on physicians hamper their ability to accurately assess pre-senting symptoms, especially when cultural or language barriers are present.Nearly 14 million people in the United States are not proficient in English. Changes in the financing and delivery of health care services, such as the emphasis on cost controls and the almost complete conversion to man-aged care for the delivery of services under Medicaid, may be especiallyproblematic for racial and ethnic minorities. The disruption of traditionalcommunity-based care and the displacement of providers who are familiarwith the language, culture, and values of ethnic communities create barriersto effective care (Leigh et al., 1999). In addition, segmentation of healthcare plans was found to play a significant role in producing poorer care forracial and ethnic minorities because they are more likely than whites to beenrolled in \"lower-end \" health plans (IOM, 2002b). Such plans are charac- terized by higher per capita resource constraints and stricter limits on cov-ered services (Phillips et al., 2000). Fragmentation of health plans alongsocioeconomic lines engenders different clinical cultures, with different prac-tice norms (Bloche, 2001). The committee encourages the health care system and policy makers in the public and private sectors to give careful consideration to the interven-tions that are identified in Unequal Treatment (IOM, 2002b) and aimed at eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health care (see Box 5 -8). Care for Chronic Conditions Americans now live longer. A child born today can expect to live more than 75 years, and advances in medicine have also extended the life spans ofearlier generations. As detailed in Chapter 1, the result is that individualsover age 65 constitute an increasingly large proportion of the U.S. popula-tion\u201413 percent today, increasing to 20 percent over the next decade. Embedded in these demographic changes is a dramatic increase in the preva-lence of chronic conditions. Chronic conditions, defined as illnesses thatlast longer than 3 months and that are not self-limiting, affect nearly half ofthe U.S. population. An estimated 100 million Americans have one or morechronic conditions, and that number is estimated to reach 134 million by2020 (Pew Environmental Health Commission, 2001). Nearly half of thosewith a chronic illness have more than one such condition (IOM, 2001a).Additionally, disabling chronic conditions affect all age groups, but abouttwo-thirds are found in individuals over age 65. With the projected growthin the number of people over age 65 increasing from 13 percent of theCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

As detailed in Crossing the Quality Chasm (IOM, 2001b: 27), effective health care for chronic disease management is a collaborative process, in-volving the \"definition of clinical problems in terms that both patients and providers understand; joint development of a care plan with goals, targets,and implementation strategies; provision of self-management training andsupport services; and active, sustained follow-up using visits, telephonecalls, e-mail, and Web-based monitoring and decision support systems. \" The current health care system does not meet the challenge of providing clinically appropriate and cost-effective care for the chronically ill. Crossing the Quality Chasm (IOM, 2001b: 28) found that \"the prevailing model ofBOX 5 -8 Legal, Regulatory, and Policy Interventions to Eliminate Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care Avoid fragmentation of health plans along socioeconomic lines. Strengthen the stability of patient -provider relationships in publicly funded health plans. Increase the proportion of underrepresented U.S. racial and ethnic minorities among health professionals. Apply the same managed care protections to publicly funded health mainte- nance organization (HMO) enrollees that apply to private HMO enrollees.

Promote the consistency and equity of care through the use of evidence-based guidelines.

Wagner and colleagues (1996) identified five ele-ments required to improve outcomes for chronically ill patients: 1. Evidence-based planned care. 2. Reorganization of practices to meet the needs of patients who re- quire more time, a broad array of resources, and closer follow-up. 3. Systematic attention to patients ' need for information and behav- ioral change. 4. Ready access to necessary clinical expertise.5. Supportive information systems. The health care delivery system as it exists today cannot deliver those elements. Recent surveys have found that less than half of U.S. patients withhypertension, depression, diabetes, and asthma are receiving appropriatetreatments (Wagner et al., 2001). Delivery of high-quality care to chroni-cally ill patients is especially challenging in a decentralized and fragmentedsystem, characterized by small practices (AMA, 1998). Smaller practiceshave great difficulty in organizing the array of services and support neededto efficiently manage chronic disease. The result is poor disease manage-ment and a high level of wasted resources. As the proportion of old andvery old increases, the system-wide impact in terms of cost and increaseddisability may well overwhelm the human and financial resources availableto care for chronically ill patients. CAPACITY OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM TO SERVE THE POPULATION The resources of the health care delivery system are not balanced well enough to provide patient-centered care, to address the complex health caredemands of an aging population, to absorb normal spikes in demand forurgent care, and to manage a large-scale emergency such as that posed by aterrorist attack. The relentless focus on controlling costs over the pastdecade has squeezed a great deal of excess capacity out of the health caresystem, particularly the hospital system. It has also reduced the time thatphysicians spend with patients and the quality of the clinical encounter. Atthe same time, the design of insurance plans (in both the public and theprivate sectors) does not support the integrated disease management proto-cols needed to treat chronic disease or the data gathering and analysisneeded for both disease management and population-level health. Underly-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM 235 ing all of these problems is the absence of a national health information infrastructure to support research, clinical medicine, and population-levelhealth. Shortages of Health Care Professionals The committee took special note of certain shortages of health care professionals, because these shortages are having a significant adverse effecton the quality of health care. The committee 's particular concerns are the underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minorities in all health professionsand the shortage of nurses, especially registered nurses (RNs) practicing inhospitals. However, the focus on these two health care professional shortage areas does not suggest the absence of problems in other fields. Acute short-ages of primary care physicians exist in many geographic areas, in certainmedical specialties, and in disciplines such as pharmacy and dentistry, toname two. In addition, a growing consensus suggests that major reformsare needed in the education and training of all health professionals. Todeliver the type of health care envisioned in Crossing the Quality Chasm (IOM, 2001b), health care professionals must be trained to work in teams,to utilize information technology effectively, and to develop the competen-cies necessary to deliver care to an increasingly diverse population. Healthprofessions education is not currently organized to produce these results. Underrepresentation of Racial and Ethnic Minorities In 2000, 9 percent of physicians and 12.3 percent of RNs were from racial and ethnic minority groups (AAMC, 2000). By comparison, racialand ethnic minorities account for more than one-quarter of the nation 's population. Among physicians, about 3 percent are African American, 2.2percent are Hispanic, and 3.6 percent are Asian (AAMC, 2000). The 2000National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses reported that 5 percent ofRNs are African American, 2 percent are Hispanic, and 3.5 percent areAsian (Spratley et al., 2000). The severe underrepresentation of racial andethnic minorities in the health professions affects access to care for minoritypopulations, the quality of care they receive, and the level of confidencethat minority patients have in the health care system. A consistent body of research indicates that African-American and Hispanic physicians are more likely to provide services in minority andunderserved communities and are more likely to treat patients who arepoor, Medicaid eligible, and sicker (IOM, 2001c). Some studies indicatethat, on average, minority physicians treat four to five times more minoritypatients than do white physicians, and studies of recent minority medicalCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html236 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH school graduates indicate that they have a greater preference to serve in minority and underserved areas. Although more research is needed to ex-amine the impact of minority health care professionals on the level of accessand quality of care, for some minority patients, having a minority physicianresults in better communication, greater patient satisfaction with care, andgreater use of preventive services (IOM, 2002b). Although evidence has notestablished that increasing the numbers of minority physicians or improv-ing cultural competence per se influences patient outcomes, existing re-search supports clear policies to increase the proportion of medical studentsdrawn from minority groups. Hospital Nursing Shortage RNs work in a variety of settings, ranging from governmental public health agency clinics to hospitals and nursing homes. The majority, how-ever, work in hospitals, although the proportion dropped from 68 percentin 1968 to 59 percent in 2000 (Spratley et al., 2000). Hospitals are facingshortages of RNs, in addition to shortages of pharmacists, laboratory tech-nologists, and radiological technologists. A recent national hospital survey(AHA, 2001b) found that of 168,000 vacant positions, 126,000 were forRN positions. Hospital vacancy rates for RN positions averaged 11 percentacross the country, ranging from about 10 percent to more than 20 percentin some states. Nationally, more than one in seven hospitals report a severeshortage of RNs, with more than 20 percent of RN positions vacant. Ingeneral, hospitals in rural areas report the highest percentage of vacantpositions. The current shortage of RNs, particularly for hospital practice, isa matter of national concern because nursing care is critical to the operationand quality of care in hospitals (Aiken et al., 1994, 2001). In a studyanalyzing more than 5 million patient discharges from 799 hospitals in 11states, Needleman and colleagues (2001) consistently found that higher RNstaffing levels were associated with a 3 to 12 percent reduction in indica-tors\u2014including lower rates of urinary tract infections, pneumonia, shock, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding and shorter lengths of stay \u2014that reflect better inpatient care. The shortage of hospital-based nurses reflects several factors, including the aging of the population, declining nursing school enrollment numbers(Sherer, 2001), the aging of the nursing workforce (the average age in-creased from 43.1 years in 1992 to 45.2 years in 2000) (Spratley et al.,2000), and dissatisfaction among nurses with the hospital work environ-ment. Furthermore, nurses have available other professional opportunities,and women, who once formed the bulk of the nursing workforce, now havealternate career prospects. These trends do not appear to be a temporary,cyclical phenomenon. The aging of the population means an increase in theCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Although some of this increase is to be expected because of the overall aging of the U.S. labor force, the proportion of workers who are age 35 andolder is increasing more for RNs than for all other occupations (IOM,1996). An aging workforce may have implications for patient care if olderRNs have less ability to perform certain physical tasks (HRSA, 2001). Theshortage of RNs poses a serious threat to the health care delivery system,and to hospitals in particular. Hospitals and the Capacity for Emergency Response Hospitals contribute in various ways to assuring the health of the pub- lic, particularly by providing acute care services, educating health profes-sionals, serving as a site for research, organizing community health promo-tion and disease prevention activities, and acting as safety-net providers.However, hospitals play a uniquely important role by serving as the pri-mary source of emergency and highly specialized care such as that in inten-sive care units (ICUs) and centers for cardiac care and burn treatment. Recent changes in the structure of the hospital industry, the reimburse- ment of hospitals by public- and private-sector insurance programs, andnursing shortages have raised questions about the ability of hospitals tocarry out these roles. Although the terrorist incidents in the fall of 2001 didnot directly test the ability of hospitals to respond to a medical crisis, theydrew particular attention to hospitals ' limited \"surge capacity \"\u2014the ability to absorb a large influx of severely injured patients \u2014in their emergency departments and specialty units. During the 1990s, the spread of managed care practices contributed to reductions in overall hospital admissions, in the length of hospital stays,and in emergency department visits. As a result of decreasing demand forhospital services and a changing financial environment, hospitals in manyparts of the country reduced the number of patient beds, eliminated certainservices, or even closed (McManus, 2001). The American Hospital Associa-tion (AHA, 2001a) reports that from 1994 to 1999, the number of emer-gency departments in the nation decreased by 8.1 percent (see Table 5 -3). Over the same period, medical and surgical bed capacities were reduced by17.7 percent, ICU bed capacities were reduced by 2.8 percent, and specialtybed (including burn bed) capacities were reduced by 3.4 percent. Althoughthese reductions may have improved the efficiencies of hospitals, they have important implications for the capacity of the health care system to respondto public health emergencies. Crowding in hospital emergency departments has been recognized as aCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

According to the AmericanHospital Association (2001a), the demand for emergency department careincreased by 15 percent between 1990 and 1999. In a random survey ofemergency department directors in 1998 and 1999, 91 percent of the 575respondents reported overcrowding problems (Derlet et al., 2001). Theovercrowding was severe, resulting in delays in testing and treatment thatcompromised patient outcomes. The emergency departments of hospitals inmany areas of New York City routinely operated at 100 percent capacity(Brewster et al., 2001). Patients regularly spent significant portions of theiradmission on gurneys in a hallway. One consequence of this crowding is the periodic closure of emergency departments and the diversion of ambulances to other facilities. Ambulancediversions have been found to impede access to emergency services in met-ropolitan areas in at least 22 states (U.S. House of Representatives, 2001);at least 75 million Americans are estimated to reside in areas affected byambulance diversions. Looking at 12 communities, Brewster and colleagues(2001) found that on average in 2001, two hospitals in Boston closed theiremergency departments each day and the Cleveland Clinic emergency de-partments were closed to patients arriving by ambulance for an average ofnearly 12 hours a day. The increase in demand for emergency care is attributed to several factors (Brewster et al., 2001). In particular, managed care rules havechanged to allow increased coverage of care provided in emergency de-partments . Hospitals are in better compliance with the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, which requires emergency depart-ments to treat patients without regard for their ability to pay.

Access to Primary Care The adequacy of hospital capacity cannot be assessed without consider- ing the system inefficiencies that characterize current insurance and caredelivery arrangements. These include the demands placed on hospital emer-gency and outpatient departments by the uninsured and those withoutaccess to a primary care provider. The unique characteristic of primary careis the role it plays as a regular or usual source of care for patients and theirfamilies. Good primary care assures continuity for the patient across levelsof care, comprehensiveness of services according to the level of health orillness, and better coordination of these services over time (Starfield, 1998). Defining the right level of immediate and standby capacity for emer- gency and inpatient care depends in part on the adequacy and effectivenessof general outpatient and primary care. For example, chronic conditionslike asthma and diabetes often can be managed effectively on an outpatientbasis, but if the conditions are poorly managed by patients or their healthcare providers, emergency or inpatient care may be necessary. Billings andcolleagues (1993) demonstrated strong links between hospital admissionrates for such conditions and the socioeconomic and insurance status of thepopulation in an area. For example, admission rates for asthma were 6.4percent higher in low-income areas than in higher-income areas, with morethan 70 percent of the variation explained by household income (Billings etal., 1993). Differences in disease prevalence accounted for only a smallportion of the differences in hospitalization rates among low- and high-income areas. Although Billings and colleagues did not draw conclusions about the causal pathways leading to these higher admission rates, it is likely that thecontributing factors include those discussed in this chapter, such as a lackof insurance or a regular source of care and the assignment of Medicaidpopulations to lower-cost health plans. A follow-up analysis found thesituation to be growing worse for low-income populations, as economicpressures, including lower reimbursements rates, higher practice costs, andlimitations on payment for diagnostic tests, squeeze providers who havehistorically delivered care to academic health centers ' low-income popula- tions (Billings et al., 1996). Bindman and colleagues (1995) similarly con-cluded that at the community level, \"there is a strong positive association between health care access and preventable hospitalization rates, suggestingthat these rates can serve as an indication of access to care. \" It would be a costly mistake to create additional emergency and inpatient capacity beforedecompressing demand by improving access to primary care services.

Geographically, areas with higher primary care physician-to-population ratios experience lower total health care costs (Welch et al.,1993; Mark et al., 1996; Franks and Fiscella, 1998; Starfield and Shi,2002). Additionally, there is evidence that primary care is associated withreduced disparities in health; areas of high income inequality that also hadgood primary care were less likely to report fair or poor self-rated health(Starfield, 2002). The link between the availability of primary care andbetter health is also supported by international evidence, which shows thatnations that value primary care are likely to have lower mortality rates (allcauses; all causes, premature; and cause specific), even when controlling formacro- and micro-level characteristics (e.g., gross domestic product and percapita income) (Macinko et al., in press). The Unfulfilled Potential of Managed Care Although Billings and colleagues focused on the preventable de- mands for hospital care among low-income and uninsured populations,Closing the Quality Chasm (IOM, 2001b) makes clear that the misuse of services also characterizes disease management among insured chroni-cally ill patients. In the early 1990s, managed care became a common feature of the health care delivery system in the United States. In theory, managed careoffers the promise of a population-based approach that can emphasizeregular preventive care and other services aimed at keeping a defined groupas healthy as possible. These benefits are most easily achieved under a fullycapitated, group practice model: patients enroll with a health care organiza-tion that is paid a certain amount per member per month to provide allnecessary or indicated services to the enrolled population, and physiciansare paid a monthly fee or are salaried, which separates payment from theprovision of individual services. This model allows a relatively stable en-rolled population for whom benefits and services can be customized; knowl-edge of the global budget within which care is to be delivered; and asalaried workforce in which health care providers have an incentive to keeppatients healthy and reduce unnecessary use of services but also have aculture in which they monitor each others ' practices and quality of care. For the patient, the model provides comprehensive care, an emphasis on pre-vention, and low out-of-pocket costs. Kaiser Permanente Medical Grouppioneered the model more than 50 years ago on the basis of early experi-ences providing health care programs for employees of Kaiser industrialCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Reimbursement rate reductions, restrictions on careand choice of physician, and other aspects of plan management disaf-fected millions of Americans from the basic concept of managed care.Furthermore, rapid turnover in enrollment, particularly in Medicaid man-aged care, ruined economic incentives for plans to view their enrollees asa long-term investment. This loss of trust in the idea of managed care isalso the loss of a great opportunity to improve quality and restrain costs.Loosely affiliated physician networks have no ability to identify theirpopulations and develop programs specifically based on the epidemiologyof the defined group. There is little ability to use data systems, sharedprotocols, or peer pressure to improve quality and reduce variations inhealth care practices. Managed care is undergoing rapid changes, some of which are likely to further undermine its viability. Consumer demands for more choice andgreater flexibility are weakening restrictions on access to providers andlimitations on services. Physicians are proving more aggressive and success-ful in their negotiations with plans to decrease constraints, and to date,most employers have been willing to accept the higher costs that result.Employer acceptance may change in the face of double-digit insurancepremium increases. Predicting the next configuration of insurance and plan delivery sys- tems is dangerous in a system undergoing such rapid transition. A numberof major insurance plans have announced that they will begin to offerdefined-contribution options. 2 This may be attractive to employers, whose liability will be defined by a specific premium amount rather than by aspecified set of benefits. Consumers will be expected to shop for their owncare with a medical spending account coupled with catastrophic benefitsfor very large expenses. This could significantly undermine the current 1 Group Health of Puget Sound and the Health Insurance Plan of New York were also pioneers in group model health maintenance organizations. 2 Defined-contribution health care benefits are a new way for employers to provide health care coverage to their employees, while no longer acting as brokers between employees and insurance companies contracted to provide benefits. An employer may choose from severaldifferent ways to put money into a health benefits account for each employee and offer the employee a menu of coverage options, with different funding levels and employee financial responsibility for each.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

However, suchplans have yet to assume a significant role in the insurance market, and fewemployers offer them as an alternative. Information Technology The development of enhanced information technology and its use in hospitals, individual provider practices, and other segments of the healthcare delivery system are essential for improving the quality of care. Betterinformation technology can also support patients and family caregivers incrucial health decisions, strengthen both personal and population-basedprevention efforts, and enhance participation in and coordination withpublic health activities. (See Chapter 3 for a discussion of the informationtechnology needs of the governmental public health infrastructure.) Crossing the Quality Chasm (IOM, 2001b) formulated the case that information technology is critical to the redesign of the health care systemto achieve a substantial improvement in the quality of care. A strong clini-cal information infrastructure is a prerequisite to reengineering processes ofcare; coordinating patient care across providers, plans, and settings andover time; supporting the operation of multidisciplinary teams and theapplication of clinical support tools; and facilitating the use of performanceand outcome measures for quality improvement and accountability. From the provider perspective, better information systems and more extensive use of information technology could dramatically improve careby offering ready access to complete and accurate patient data and to avariety of information resources and tools \u2014clinical guidelines, decision- support systems, digital prescription-writing programs, and public healthdata and alerts, for example \u2014that can enhance the quality of clinical deci- sion making. Computer-based systems for the entry of physician ordershave been found to have sizable benefits in enhancing patient safety (Bateset al., 1998, 2001; Schiff et al., 2000). Despite profound growth in clinical knowledge and medical technol- ogy, the health care delivery system has been relatively untouched by therevolution in information technology that has transformed other sectors ofsociety and the economy. Many health care settings lack basic computersystems to provide clinical information or support clinical decision making.Even where electronic medical record systems are being implemented, mostof those systems remain proprietary products of individual institutions andhealth plans that are based on standards of specific vendors. The development and application of interoperable systems and secure information-sharing practices are essential to gain greater benefits frominformation technology. At present, only a few institutions have had theCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Those efforts illustrate both the costsinvolved in developing health information systems and some of the benefitsthat might be expected. Kaiser Permanente, for example, is investing $2billion in a web-based system encompassing all of the critical features neededto provide patient-centered, high-quality care: a nationwide clinical infor-mation system, a means for patients to communicate with doctors andnurses to seek medical advice, access by clinicians to clinical guidelines andother knowledge resources, and computerized order entry (Krall, 1998). So far, however, adoption of even common and less costly information technologies has been limited. Only a small fraction of physicians offer e-mail interaction (13 percent, in a 2001 poll), a simple and convenient toolfor efficient communication with their patients (Harris Interactive, 2001).Some of the documented reasons for the low level of physician -patient e- mail communication include concerns about lack of reimbursement for thistype of service and concerns about confidentiality and liability. These legiti-mate issues are slowly being addressed in policy and practice, but there is along way to go if this form of communication is to achieve its potential forimproving interactions between patients and providers. Enhanced information technology also promises to aid patients and the public in other ways. The Internet already offers a wealth of informationand access to the most current evidence to help individuals maintain theirown health and manage disease. In addition, support groups and interac-tive programs offer additional approaches to empower consumers. Person-alized systems for comprehensive home care may improve outcomes andreduce costs. Medicare 's pilot project IdeaTel \u2014Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine \u2014offers web-based home systems to rural and inner-city diabetics to support home monitoring, customized information,and secure links to providers and to the patients ' own medical records (www.dmi.columbia.edu/ideatel/info.html). Other efforts to build a personal health record (PHR) created or cocreated and controlled by the individual \u2014and instantly available to sup- port treatment in any setting \u2014suggest that the PHR may provide a compre- hensive, accurate, and continuous record to support health and health careacross the life span (Jones et al., 1999). A sophisticated health information infrastructure is also important to support public health monitoring and disease surveillance activities. Sys-tems and protocols for linking health care providers and governmentalpublic health agencies are vital for detecting emerging health threats andsupporting appropriate decisions by all parties. The committee cautions,however, that systems dedicated to a single use, such as bioterrorism, willnot be optimal; systems designed to be comprehensive and flexible will beof greater overall value. Ultimately, such systems should also allow theCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

For information technology to transform the health sector as it has banking and other forms of commerce that depend on the accurate, secureexchange of large amounts of information, action must be taken at thenational level to develop the National Health Information Infrastructure(NHII) (NRC, 2000). The committee endorses the call by the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS) (2002) for the nationto build a twenty-first century health support system \u2014a comprehensive, knowledge-based system capable of providing information to all who needit to make sound decisions about health. Such a system can help realize thepublic interest related to quality improvement in health care and to diseaseprevention and health promotion for the population as a whole. The rapiddevelopment and widespread implementation of an extensive set of stan-dards for technology and information exchange among providers, govern-mental public health agencies, and individuals are critical. Nevertheless, as the NCVHS report describes, neither the opportunities nor the barriers to the development of the NHII are related solely to infor-mation technology. To realize the full potential of the NHII, supportivechanges in the social, economic, and legal infrastructures are also required.Policies promoting the portability and continuity of personal health infor-mation are essential. Values, practices, relationships, laws, and investmentand reimbursement policies must support the creation and use of data andinformation systems that are consistent with the vision for the NHII (seeChapter 3 for an additional discussion and recommendation). COLLABORATION WITH GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES The activities and interests of the health care delivery system and the governmental public health agencies clearly overlap in certain areas, butthere is relatively little collaboration between them. In addition, the author-ity of state health departments in quality monitoring, licensure, and ratesetting can cause serious tensions between them and health care organiza-tions. The committee discusses the extent of this separation and the particu-lar need for better collaboration, especially in regard to assuring access tohealth care services, disease surveillance activities, and partnerships towardbroader health promotion efforts. The Emergence of Separate Systems Within the public health system in the United States, collaboration between the health care sector and governmental public health agencies isCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM 245 generally weak. This reflects the divergence and separate development of two distinct sectors following the Second World War. Lasker and col-leagues observed, \"[t]he dominant, highly respected medical sector focused on individual patients, emphasizing technologically sophisticated diagnosisand treatment and biological mechanisms of disease. The considerablysmaller, less well-appreciated public health sector concentrated on popula-tions, prevention, nonbiological determinants of health, and safety-net pri-mary care \" (Lasker et al., 1997: 274). As disciplines and professional fields, medicine and public health evolved with minimal levels of interaction, andoften without recognition of the lost opportunities to improve the health ofindividuals and the population. The health care and governmental publichealth sectors are also very unequal in terms of their resources, prestige,and influence on public policy. The failure to collaborate characterizes not only the interactions be- tween governmental public health agencies and the organizations and indi-viduals involved in the financing and delivery of health care in the privatesector but also financing within the federal government. Within the Depart-ment of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the Centers for Medicare andMedicaid Services (CMS) administer the two public insurance programswith little interaction or joint planning with agencies of the U.S. PublicHealth Service (PHS). Even the congressional authorizing committees forthese activities are separate. For example, the Substance Abuse and MentalHealth Services Administration, a PHS agency, administers block grants tostates to augment funding for mental health and substance abuse programs,neither of which is well supported under Medicaid. Until recently, theMedicaid waiver program, administered by CMS on behalf of the Secretaryof Health and Human Services, did not provide protection of reimburse-ment rates for clinics within the safety-net system. At the same time, theHealth Resources and Services Administration, the PHS agency chargedwith funding federally qualified safety-net clinics for the poor, and theIndian Health Service were both seeking funds to support the increasingdeficits of these clinics due to the growing number of uninsured individualsand the low rates of reimbursement for Medicaid clinics. The operational separation of public health and health care financing programs mirrors the cultural differences that characterize medicine andpublic health. American fascination with technology, science, and medicalinterventions and a relatively poor understanding of the determinants ofhealth (see Chapter 2) or of the workings of the governmental publichealth agencies also contribute to the lower status, fewer resources, andlimited influence of public health. The committee views these status andresource differences as barriers to mutually respectful collaboration andto achieving the shared vision of healthy people in healthy communities.The committee also urges greater efforts on the part of the health careCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The Role of Governmental Public Health Agencies as Health Care Providers Public health departments have always differed greatly in regard to the delivery of health care services, based on the availability of such services inthe community and other reasons (Moos and Miller, 1981). Some provideno personal health care services at all, whereas others provide some assort-ment of primary health care and safety-net services. In general, however,there has been a decrease in the number of local governmental public healthagencies involved in direct service provision. In a recent survey of publichealth agencies, primary care or direct medical care services were the leastcommon services provided (NACCHO, 2001). Despite this, 28 percent oflocal public health departments report that they are the sole safety-netproviders in their communities (Keane et al., 2001). During the 1990s, Medicaid shifted from a fee-for-service program to a managed care model. This change has been a challenge to the multiple rolesof public health departments as community-based primary health care pro-viders, safety-net providers, and providers of population-based or tradi-tional public health services. The challenge has been both financial andorganizational. First, managed care plans reimburse safety-net providersless generously than fee-for-service Medicaid providers do (under Medic-aid, federally qualified health centers benefited from a federal requirementfor full-cost reimbursement), and they impose administrative and servicerestrictions that result in reduced overall rates of compensation (IOM,2000a). In many states and localities, these changes have decreased therevenue available to public health departments and public clinics and hospi-tals. In many cases, funds were no longer available for population-basedessential public health services or had to be diverted to the more visiblyurgent need of keeping clinics and hospitals open (CDC, 1997). The resultof this interplay is that many governmental public health agencies havefound themselves in a strained relationship with managed care organiza-tions: on the one hand, encouraging their active partnership in anintersectoral public health system and, on the other, competing with themfor revenues (Lumpkin et al., 1998). Second, the shift of Medicaid servicesto a managed care environment led some public health departments to scaledown or dismantle their infrastructure for the delivery of direct medicalcare. The recent trend of the exit of managed care from the Medicaidmarket has left some people without a medical home and, in cases ofCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM 247 changes in eligibility, has left some people uninsured. This problem may be most acute in rural areas, where public health departments are often thesole safety-net providers (Johnson and Morris, 1998). One strategy to help lessen the negative impacts of changes in health care financing undertaken by some public health departments has been the devel-opment of formal relationships (e.g., negotiating and implementing memo-randa of agreement) with local managed care organizations that provideMedicaid and, in some cases, safety-net services. Such arrangements havemade possible some level of integration of health care and public healthservices, enhanced information exchange and continuity of care, and allowedpublic health departments to be reimbursed for the provision of some of theservices that are covered by the benefits packages of managed care plans(Martinez and Closter, 1998). At this time, governmental public health agen-cies are still called on to play a role in assurance broader than that which maybe compatible with their other responsibilities to population health. How-ever, closer integration between these governmental public health agenciesand the health care delivery system can help address the needs of the unin-sured and underinsured. Denver Health, in Colorado, provides an intriguingexample of a hybrid, integrated public -private health system (Mays et al., 2000). Denver Health is the local (county and city) public health authority, aswell as a managed care organization and hospital service. Although changesin the Medicaid program continue to challenge Denver Health, it continues tobalance its broad responsibilities to the public 's health with its role and capacity as a large health care provider. Disease Surveillance and Reporting Disease surveillance and reporting provide a classic exemplar of essen- tial collaboration between the health care system and the governmentalpublic health agencies. The latter rely on health care providers and labora-tories to supply the data that are the basis for disease surveillance. Forinstance, in the fall of 2001, reports from physicians who diagnosed thefirst cases of anthrax were essential in recognizing and responding to thebioterrorism attack. States mandate the reporting of various infectious diseases (e.g., AIDS, hepatitis B, measles, rabies, and tuberculosis) and submit data to federaldisease surveillance systems (CDC, 1999). Governmental public health agen-cies also depend on astute clinicians to inform them of sentinel cases ofrecognized diseases that represent a special threat to the public 's health and of unusual cases, sometimes without a confirmed diagnosis, that may repre-sent a newly emerging infection, such as Legionnaires ' disease or West Nile virus in North America. Other types of public health surveillance activities,Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html248 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH such as registries for cancer cases and for childhood immunizations, also depend on reporting from the health care system. Effective surveillance requires timely, accurate, and complete reports from health care providers. In the case of infectious diseases, if all systemswork effectively, the necessary information regarding the diagnosis for apatient with a reportable disease is transmitted to the state or local publichealth department by a physician or laboratory. For unusual or particularlyserious conditions, public health officials offer guidance on treatment op-tions and control measures and monitor the community for any additionalreports of similar illness. For diseases like tuberculosis and sexually trans-mitted diseases, public health agencies facilitate active tracking and prophy-lactic treatment of persons exposed to an infected individual. Disease re-porting requirements vary from state to state, although most states includediseases identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)as part of the National Notifiable Disease Reporting System. Disease reporting is not complete, however. For diseases under national surveillance, from 6 to 90 percent of cases are reported, depending on thedisease (Teutsch and Churchill, 1994; Thacker and Stroup, 1994). Incom-plete reporting may reflect a lack of understanding by some health careproviders of the role of the governmental public health agencies in infec-tious disease monitoring and control. In some instances, physicians andlaboratories may be unaware of the requirement to report the occurrence ofa notifiable disease or may underestimate the importance of such a require-ment. The difficulty of reporting in a busy practice is also a barrier. Notifiable disease reporting systems within public health departments with strong liaisons with the health care community are important in thedetection and recognition of bioterrorism events. However, this valuabletool has not been well supported and, as noted earlier, suffers from issuesof lack of timeliness and incomplete reporting, as well as complex orunclear reporting procedures and limited feedback from governmentalpublic health agencies on how data are used (Baxter et al., 2000; StaggElliott, 2002). Health care delivery systems may fear that the data will beused to measure performance, and concerns about patient confidentialitycan also contribute to a reluctance to report some diagnoses. New federalregulations regarding the confidentiality of medical records, required bythe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (P.L. 104 -191) have generated enormous uncertainty and apprehension among healthcare providers and health systems regarding the sharing of individualclinical data. Health care providers may also reduce their use of laboratory tests to confirm a diagnosis. This may be because of cost concerns or insuranceplan restrictions or simply professional judgment that the test is unneces-sary for appropriate clinical care. However, when fewer diagnostic tests areCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Reduced use of laboratory testing preventsthe analyses of pathogenic isolates needed for disease tracking, testing ofnew pathogens, and determining the levels of susceptibility to antimicrobialagents. Other changes in the health care delivery system also raise concerns about the infectious disease surveillance system. As patterns of health caredelivery change, old reporting systems are undermined, but the opportunitiesoffered by new types of care systems and technologies have not been realized.For example, traditional patterns of reporting may be lost as health caredelivery shifts from inpatient to outpatient settings. Hospital-based epide-miological reporting systems no longer capture many diagnoses now madeand treated on an outpatient basis. This would not be a problem if health caresystems used currently available information technologies, including elec-tronic medical records and internal disease surveillance systems. Better information systems that allow the rapid and continuous ex- change of clinical information among health care providers and with publichealth agencies have the potential to improve disease surveillance as well asaid in clinical decision making while avoiding the use of unnecessary diag-nostic tests. With such a system, a physician seeing an influx of patientswith severe sore throats could use information on the current communityprevalence of confirmed streptococcal pharyngitis and the antibiotic sensi-tivities of the cultured organisms to choose appropriate medications. Froma public health perspective, such a system would permit continuous analysisof data from a number of clinical sites, enabling rapid recognition andresponse to new disease patterns in the community (see Chapter 3 for adiscussion of syndrome surveillance). For example, toxic or infectious ex-posures could be tracked more easily if the characteristics of every patientencounter were integrated into one system and if everyone had unimpededaccess to systems of care that could generate such data. A CDC-funded project of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates (a large multi-specialty group) offers a glimpse of the benefits to be gained through col-laboration between health care delivery systems and governmental publichealth agencies and specifically through the effective use of medical infor-mation systems (Lazarus et al., 2002). The Harvard Vanguard electronicmedical system is queried each night for specific diagnoses assigned duringthe preceding day in the course of routine care. Diagnoses of interest aregrouped into syndromes, and rates of new episodes are computed for all ofeastern Massachusetts and each census tract. Expected numbers of newepisodes are obtained from a generalized linear mixed model that uses datafrom 1996 to 1999. These expected numbers allow estimates of the prob-ability of observing specific numbers of cases, either overall or in specificCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The value of this type of real-time monitoring of unusual disease outbreaksis obvious for early identification of bioterrorism attacks as well as forimprovements in clinical care and population health. Sentinel Surveillance Reports of sentinel events have proved useful for the monitoring of many diseases, but such reports may be serendipitous and generated be-cause of close clustering, unusual morbidity and mortality, novel clinicalfeatures, or the chance availability of medical expertise. Sentinel networksthat specifically link groups of participating health care providers or healthcare delivery systems to a central data-receiving and -processing center havebeen particularly helpful in monitoring specific infections or designatedclasses of infections. Examples of such networks are the National Nosoco-mial Infections Surveillance system and the National Molecular SubtypingNetwork for Foodborne Disease Surveillance (PulseNet). More recently,CDC has implemented a strategy directed to the identification of emerginginfectious diseases in collaboration with many public health partners. TheEmerging Infections Program (EIP) is a collaboration among CDC, statepublic health departments, and other public health partners for the purposeof conducting population-based surveillance and research on infectious dis-eases. At present, nine states (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia,Maryland, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, and Tennessee) act as a na-tional resource for the surveillance, prevention, and control of emerginginfectious diseases (CDC, 2002). The EIP sites have performed investiga-tions of meningococcal and streptococcal diseases and have establishedsurveillance for unexplained deaths and severe illnesses as an attempt toidentify diseases and infectious agents, known and unknown, that can leadto severe illness or death (CDC, 2002). Preparing Health Care Professionals Academic health centers (AHCs) serve as a critical interface with gov- ernmental public health agencies in several ways. First, as noted earlier,AHCs are an important part of the safety-net system in most urban areas.Second, they are the principal providers of specialized services and serve asregional referral centers for smaller towns or cities and rural areas. Both innormal periods and especially when confronted with either natural disas-ters or terrorist events, the specialized care units are an essential resourcefor public health. Moreover, they are also primary loci for research andtraining. AHCs also have a unique and special set of values that they bringto health care that transcend the discrete functions they perform.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM 251 The environment in which AHCs operate has changed substantially over the past decade. The advent of managed care plans that seek servicesfrom the lowest-cost appropriate provider and changes in federal (Medi-care) reimbursement policies that reduced subsidies for costs associatedwith AHCs ' missions in education, research, and patient care have created considerable pressure on academic institutions to increase efficiency andcontrol costs. At the same time, advances in information technology andthe explosion of knowledge from biomedical research have enormous im-plications for the role of AHCs in the health care system and in populationhealth. Scientific and technological advances will permit clinical care tointervene early in a disease process by identifying and modifying personalrisk. The burgeoning knowledge base will require different educationalapproaches to use the continuously expanding evidence base, with an em-phasis on continuing education and lifetime learning. These changes may result in a broader mission for AHCs that explicitly includes improving the public 's health, generating and disseminating knowl- edge, advancing e-health approaches (i.e., that utilize the Internet and elec-tronic communication technologies), providing education to current healthprofessionals, providing community service and outreach, and deliveringcare that has the attributes necessary for practice. The ability of academicmedicine to evolve into a broader mission will depend on changes in pay-ment systems that may be difficult to achieve and on internal changeswithin AHCs that may be equally difficult. Governmental public health agencies may also play an important role in preventive medicine and public health education. Health departments,for example, provide unique venues for the training of nurses, physicians,and other health care professionals in the basics of community-based healthcare and gain an understanding of population-level approaches to healthimprovement. Furthermore, public health students and preventive medicineresidents gain practical experience in health department rotations, wherethey participate in program planning and evaluation and learn about as-sessing a community 's health care needs and implementing strategies that change the conditions for health. COLLABORATION WITH OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM ACTORS In addition to the linkages between the health care delivery system and governmental public health agencies, health care providers also interfacewith other actors in the public health system, such as communities, themedia, and businesses and employers.

The recent trend among universities to assess their level of involvement in their communities and to develop programs focused on \"service learn- ing,\" and such public service oriented academic work includes AHCs. Calleson and colleagues (2002) surveyed the executives and staff of eightAHCs around the country and found that community -campus partner- ships can strengthen the traditional mission of AHCs. The involvement ofAHCs in the communities is also likely to increase in the coming years. TheAHCs surveyed listed several factors that facilitated the development ofrelationships with communities and community organizations, includingthe request of the communities themselves and the growing populationhealth orientation of the health care sector. Furthermore, non-academiccommunity health centers also frequently have close ties to their communi-ties, collaborating to assess local health needs, providing needed services,and supporting community efforts with research expertise and technicalassistance in planning and evaluation. Many hospitals participate in broadcommunity-based efforts to achieve some of the conditions necessary forhealth, for instance, collaborating with community development corpora-tions to contribute financial, human, and technical resources (U.S. Depart-ment of Housing and Urban Development, 2002). Montefiore MedicalCenter in the Bronx, New York, for example, has partnered with a localnonprofit organization to develop low- and moderate-income housing andto establish a neighborhood kindergarten (Seedco and N-PAC, 2002). Ad-ditionally, Montefiore Medical Center partners with local high schools todevelop health care professions education programs intended to createnew career options and improve the likelihood inner-city youth will stay inschool (Montefiore Medical Center, 2001). Hospitals are also employers,and in the case of two Lawndale, Illinois, hospitals, collaboration with thelocal development corporation and other neighborhood organizations in1999 made affordable local housing available to employees, helping tofacilitate community development (University of Illinois, 1999). In Provi-dence, Rhode Island, a community partnership of nonprofit and indepen-dent hospitals and colleges works to improve children 's quality of life by providing school-based health services, innovative and enhanced educa-tion through teacher and staff training, and support to improve homeenvironments through housing advocacy (Health & Education Leadershipfor Providence, 2001; Providence Public School District, 2002). Many hospitals and health care systems have seen the value of going beyond the needs of the individuals who enter the health care system toengage in broader community health action, even within the constraints ofCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The National Community Care Network Demon- stration Program, sponsored by the Hospital Research and Education Trust(HRET), reports on hospitals across the country that are supporting activi-ties beyond the delivery of medical care to improve health status and qual-ity of life in local communities. Some of the motivation comes from theincreasing pressure on nonprofit hospitals to justify their tax-exempt statusthrough the provision of services that benefit the community, largely theprovision of charity care; yet, many are seeing that investments in commu-nity health improvement are greater in value than the provision of medicalcare for preventable diseases (Barnett and Torres, 2001). Vignettes drawn from the experience of American Hospital Association NOVA Award recipients illustrate the importance of investing in overallcommunity health (AHA, 2002). For example, in 1994, Parkland Healthand Hospital System in Dallas noted that injury rates in the communitywere three times the national average and that trauma admissions hadjumped 38 percent in one year (53 percent of that care is uncompensated).As a result, the organization decided to convene the county 's leading trauma care providers, police, and civic groups to investigate and solve the prob-lem. With start-up funding from a local foundation, its own fundraising,and annual corporate sponsorships ranging from $35,000 to $150,000from local hospitals and businesses, the coalition launched a Safe Commu-nities initiative with a 52-member community advisory panel. Coalitionmembers decided to tackle, in order, injuries caused by car accidents,violence, falls, and burns, through 11 initiatives involving more than80 community organizations and agencies. Over a 2-week period, therewas a 13 percent reduction in trauma admissions from car crashes due to apublic awareness campaign and police initiative (AHA, 2002). A 1998 finalist for the Foster G. McGaw Prize for Excellence in Commu- nity Service co-sponsored by AHA, the Franklin Community Health Network(FCHN) in Farmington, Maine, took the lead in developing a coalition andproviding seed money to start a Rural Schools Equity Campaign (AHA,2002). With high levels of youth involvement, and media cooperation, thecampaign led to the legislative reformulation of property taxes to increasefunding for rural schools in FCHN 's service area by $1.3 million. In a further example, the Crozer-Keystone Health System that serves Chester,Pennsylvania, was declared a distressed municipality by the state in 1994.Although at the time the health system had been increasing its health careoutreach programs, it realized it had to look at \"root causes. \" As the largest employer in Chester, the system organized Community Connections, amosaic of health, economic, and social programs and services developed inpartnership with 20 other organizations, a local university, and governmen-tal agencies. Programs included attracting other businesses to Chester, set-ting up a business incubator building, and colocating multiple health andCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Under the guidance of an external review panel, HRET and the Volun- tary Hospital Association of America (VHA) Health Foundation reviewedthe experiences of recipients of the Foster G. McGaw Prize 3 from 1986 to 1998 and VHA Community Health Improvement Leadership Awards from1996 to 1998. Fifteen of 20 winners participated in a study, which includeda self-assessment of changes since the time of the award and in-depthinterviews with chief executive officers, trustees, and those leading theinitiative. Although this survey serves only as an illustration of what may bepossible, several elements appeared supportive of a sustained commitmentto efforts at community health improvement. These included Committing leadership at multiple levels through the top leader- ship to sustain changes; Developing community partnerships to develop champions outside the organization; Protecting funding and leadership of community health initiatives while integrating community health values into the culture of the parentorganization; Linking community work with clinical work (mission alignment); Building an evidence base through evaluation and ongoing mea- surement of community health indicators; and Exploring external revenue streams and advocating for changes in current health care financing and funding for such efforts (VHA HealthFoundation and HRET, 2000). Boufford (1999) has suggested a Community Health Improvement Strategy that identifies a number of steps that provider organizations cantake in such community-based efforts (see Box 5 -9). However, payment systems are critical to encourage and sustain these network initiatives, andcurrent reimbursement policies in public and private insurance are notdesigned to support population-focused care in a noncapitated system. The health care sector can also develop linkages with the media to help ensure the accuracy of health information, communicate risk, and facilitatethe public understanding of health care. For example, health care organiza- 3 The Foster G.

Additionally, the media may be a powerful tool forfamiliarizing the public with health and health care issues and a conduit forraising important questions, stimulating public interest, or even influencingthe public 's health behaviors. For example, the popular prime time televi- sion show ER frequently serves as a platform for health information, with episodes exploring topics such as childhood immunizations, contraception,and violence (Brodie et al., 2001; also see Chapter 7). Businesses and employers most commonly interface with the health care sector in purchasing and designing employee health benefits, withgoals such as the inclusion of comprehensive preventive health care ser-vices. However, there are examples of wide-reaching business -health care linkages, such as the efforts to ensure quality of care and enhanced con-sumer choice undertaken by the Pacific Business Group on Health (seeChapter 6). Chapter 4 provides additional examples of fruitful communitypartnerships involving the health care sector. IMPLICATIONS OF GROWING HEALTH CARE COSTS As the committee has noted, health-related (mostly health care-related) spending in the United States amounted to $1.3 trillion in 2000, about 13.2BOX 5 -9 Community Health Improvement Strategy 1.

After a period of stability in the mid-1990s, health care costs are again rising because ofseveral factors (Heffler et al., 2002). Prescription drug spending, in particu-lar, has increased sharply, and increased by 17.3 percent from 1999 to2000 (HCFA, 2002). This increase comes from the growth of the olderpopulation and the proportion of the overall population with chronic con-ditions, along with the introduction of new and more expensive drugs,many of which are used to treat chronic conditions. In addition, spendingfor hospital services increased by 5.1 percent between 1999 and 2000,reaching $412 billion, and the cost of nursing home and home health careincreased by 3.3 percent (Levit et al., 2002). However, the increase inhealth spending also reflects the success of federal and state efforts to enrollmore low-income children in Medicaid and the State Children 's Health Insurance Program, increased enrollment in Medicare as the populationages, and some erosion of unpopular cost-control features imposed bymanaged care plans. With the economic downturn in 2001, the growth in health care spend- ing creates added financial burdens for everyone, including individuals seek-ing care or insurance coverage, employers offering health insurance ben-efits, and governments at the federal, state, and local levels managingpublicly funded insurance programs (Fronstin, 2002; Trude et al., 2002).Substantial increases in health insurance premiums are a clear indication ofthese economic stresses. For example, the California Public Employees ' Retirement System, which is the nation 's second largest public purchaser of employee health benefits, recently announced that health insurance premi-ums would increase by 25 percent (Connoly, 2002). States are experiencingserious pressures from growth in Medicaid spending, which increased byabout 13 percent from 2001 to 2002, following a 10.6 percent increase in2001 (NASBO, 2002a). With revenues increasing by only about 5 percentin the same period, Medicaid now accounts for more than 20 percent oftotal state spending (NASBO, 2002b). The growing cost of health care has obvious implications for the nation 's readiness to address the problems discussed in this chapter. Provid- ing coverage to the uninsured, improving coverage for certain types of care,strengthening the emergency response and surge capacity in the hospitalsector, and investing in information systems that can improve the quality ofindividual care and population-based disease surveillance will all requiresignificant new resources from the public and private sectors. Althoughthese steps can be expected to improve the nation 's health and may even reduce costs over time, the initial investment will be substantial. The com-mittee is concerned that with the escalation of expenditures, going in largemeasure toward maintaining current services, it will be difficult to identifyCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlTHE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM 257 the necessary public- and private-sector resources that will be needed for new activities. The committee recommends that bold, large-scale demonstrations be funded by the federal government and other major investors in health careto test radical new approaches to increase the efficiency and effectiveness ofhealth care financing and delivery systems. The experiments should effec-tively link delivery systems with other components of the public healthsystem and focus on improving population health while eliminating dispari-ties. The demonstrations should be supported by adequate resources toenable innovative ideas to be fairly tested. CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS This chapter has outlined the main areas in which the health care delivery system and the governmental public health agencies interface. Theseareas include the regulatory and quality monitoring functions performed bygovernmental agencies, disease surveillance and reporting by health careproviders, and the provision of safety-net services. Although assurance is acore function of public health, governmental public health agencies oftendo more than assure that people can access health care services; publichealth departments may become providers of last resort in areas where noother services are available for low-income, uninsured populations andwhen managed care services to Medicaid and uninsured populations arediscontinued. These circumstances force public health departments to pro-vide personal health care services instead of using their resources andpopulation-level approaches to guide and support community efforts tochange the conditions for health. Closer collaboration and integrationbetween governmental public health agencies and the health care deliverysystem may enhance the capacities of both to improve population healthand may support the efforts of other public health system actors.

Through these economic activities,employers provide jobs and incomes to America's families. As noted in Chap-ter 2, employment and the workplace are important determinants of healththat can generate protective health effects through income and social ties aswell as adverse health effects (i.e., poor work conditions and job strain). Thischapter provides information regarding the ways in which employers (bothpublic and private), as actors in the public health system, can make importantcontributions to the health of the population through activities that are spe-cifically directed toward health concerns. The chapter begins with a discussion of how American employers, as providers of health care benefits to their employees, contribute significantlyto supporting the conditions for health of a large proportion of Americanworkers and their dependents. The discussion then addresses the importantrole that employers play in ensuring quality and accountability for thehealth care services purchased by and for their employees. The chapter thendiscusses the rationale for employer investment in the health of employeesand how sponsoring health promotion and disease prevention activities inthe workplace and improving workplace conditions promote employeehealth. Finally, the chapter ends with a discussion of a range of health-promoting activities\u2014lessening environmental pollution and involvementin civic activities in the community, for example\u2014in which employers andthe business sector at large can engage to help promote the health of thepopulation.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlEMPLOYERS AND BUSINESS 269 EMPLOYERS' ROLE IN HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE Employers make a major contribution to population health and health security because of the important role they play in providing health insur-ance. Employers are primarily motivated to offer health insurance benefitsto recruit and retain employees and to be competitive in the marketplace.Employees value health insurance and benefits and the opportunity to ex-tend such coverage to their dependents. For a number of historical reasons, employment is the foundation of the private health insurance system in the United States. Ninety percent of per-sons under the age of 65 who are privately insured obtain their health insur-ance through employers. Voluntary employer-sponsored health insurance isoffered to employees and their dependents as part of a typical compensationpackage. In 2002, 62 percent of all firms (including both public and privateemployers) offered health benefits to their employees, a decline from a high of 67 percent in 2000 (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2002). The percentage of firms offering health benefits varies by the size of the firm. For example, in 2002, 99 percent of firms with more than 200 work-ers offered health benefits to their employees, whereas less than 61 percentof small firms (those with 3 to 199 employees) offered such benefits (seeFigure 6 -1) (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2002). Small firms are less likely to offer health insurance for a number of reasons, including the increased cost of a comparable insurance packagebecause of higher administrative costs, lower employee wages, and morepart-time workers (Custer and Ketsche, 2000). Employees place a high value on health insurance. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute and Mathew Greenwald & Associates,Inc.'s Value of Benefits Survey, 60 percent of employees rank health insur- ance as the most important benefit. Employees also report that benefits(e.g., health insurance and retirement plans) continue to be a very impor-tant factor in job selection (EBRI, 2002; Lave et al., 1999; Peele et al.,2000). Most employers (both private and public) believe that they play an important role in providing health insurance coverage and that they canprovide better coverage than employees could buy on their own. However,changing economic pressures are causing employers, particularly privatefirms, to reconsider the nature of their health insurance offerings. Pressuresresulting from the slowing of the U.S. economy, rising health care costsassociated in part with increasingly looser forms of managed care, risingprescription drug prices, and employee demands are making it more diffi-cult for small employers to offer insurance coverage and for large employ-ers to maintain premiums at affordable levels (Custer and Ketsche, 2000;Lambrew, 2001; Kaiser Family Foundation, 2002). Data indicate that pre-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Premiums for employer-based health insurance increased an average of 11 percent in 2001, the largest increasesince 1992. Large employers faced, on average, a 10.2 percent increase inhealth insurance costs, whereas the smallest employers (those with three tonine employees) experienced an average increase in premiums of 16.5 per-cent (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2002). As their costs rise, many employersexpect to ask employees to pay more for insurance in the years to come andto pay for a higher proportion of the costs of care in terms of higherdeductibles or copayments when they actually use services. Increasing health insurance premiums influence whether an employee (as well as dependents) has coverage or joins the ranks of the uninsured.Employees typically pay between one-quarter and one-third of the total020406080100120 1996 1998 2000 2001 20023-9 Workers 10-24 Workers 25-49 Workers 50-199 Workers All Small 6 -1 Percentage of firms offering health benefits, by firm size, 1996 - 2001.

The proportion of employees who choose to participate in employer-sponsored health insurance is inversely related to the employee 's contribu- tion to the cost. The expense and competing demands on family income arethe main reasons individuals report for declining an offer of employment-based coverage (Cooper and Schone, 1997; Rowland et al., 1998; Hoffmanand Schlobohm, 2000). Individuals who decline employer-based health in-surance are typically covered through a spouse or some other type of cover-age, and about 4 percent remain uninsured. The consequences of beinguninsured are described in Chapter 5 and in past reports of the Institute ofMedicine (IOM, 2001a, 2002). EMPLOYERS ' ROLE IN ASSURING HEALTH CARE QUALITY As purchasers for the health services of a large proportion of American families, the employer sector has an important role to play in ensuring theavailability of high-quality health care services. Recent Institute of Medi-cine (IOM) reports have noted that the American health care delivery sys-tem is in need of fundamental change and that purchasers (employers andgovernmental agencies such as the Centers for Medicare and MedicaidServices) can play an important role in demanding health care services thatare safe, effective, patient centered, timely, efficient, and equitable (IOM,2001a). Over the years, many employers (both private and public) have been strong partners of health plans and other health care organizations in ef-forts to improve health care quality. They were active participants in theNational Committee for Quality Assurance initiative to develop the HealthPlan Employer Data and Information Set in the early 1990s. The data setattempts to standardize a process for assessing and comparing health planperformance so that purchasers and consumers have a better sense of thequality of services provided. Another partnership, the Washington BusinessGroup on Health, has worked over the past 27 years with approximately170 employer members to improve employee health and productivitythrough attention to employee mental health issues and clinical preventiveservice guidelines, among others. More recently, the Leapfrog Group, founded in 1999 and composed of growing numbers of Fortune 500 companies and other large health carepurchasers, has joined forces to \"trigger a giant leap forward in quality, customer service and affordability of health care. \" The two-pronged strat- egy to achieve this goal involves educating the public about patient safetyand defining a set of purchasing principles designed to promote safety andincrease the value of health care. Other employer-based initiatives includeCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html272 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH the National Business Coalition on Health, a membership organization of nearly 85 employer-led coalitions representing more than 11,000 mid- andlarge-sized employers and approximately 21 million employees and theirdependents. These coalitions have joined together to collectively purchasehealth care, to proactively challenge high costs and the inefficient deliveryof health care, and to share information on quality. Through these effortsand others across the country, the business community can be proactive inshaping the health care delivery system and promoting quality. Illustrations of other employment-based efforts to improve health care quality include specific activities of the California Public Employees Retire-ment System (CalPERS) and the Minnesota Health Plan Initiative to Im-prove Health Care. Many employer groups are also involved in preventionactivities sponsored by the Partnership for Prevention, a national nonprofitorganization dedicated to increasing the resources for and knowledge abouteffective disease prevention and health promotion policies and practices. CalPERS is one of the oldest purchasing coalitions in the country, representing one-third of public agencies in California; it holds the purchas-ing power of more than 1 million people and $1.7 billion a year in premi-ums. CalPERS pioneered the use of patient satisfaction and medical qualityreports to encourage the provision of high-quality medical care from itsparticipating plans (CalPERS, 2002). The combination of consumerism andstrong purchasing influence is working to help improve the quality of healthcare for CalPERS members. In another pioneering move to improve health care quality, five health plans (HealthPartners, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, Medica,PreferredOne, and UCare Minnesota) covering the majority of Minnesotaresidents came together to endorse evidence-based standard treatments andprevention procedures. This was the first time that the majority of healthplans in a state have collaborated around setting and adopting evidence-based standards. Under the auspices of the Institute for Clinical SystemImprovements, a not-for-profit corporation, physicians and other healthcare professionals reviewed the scientific evidence and recommended thebest course of action for 50 health problems such as urinary tract infection,hypertension, diabetes, and lower back pain. The health plans believe thatuse of the treatment guidelines is responsive to the health care qualityconcerns raised by IOM (2001b) and will lead to improved and moreconsistent care across the state (Freudenheim, 2001). Recognizing that employers often have a difficult time balancing deci- sions about which benefits to purchase for their employees, the Partnershipfor Prevention convened a 25-member advisory panel to provide guidanceon the clinical and preventive services that provide the \"best bang for the buck. \" To begin, the panel \u2014composed of public- and private-sector pur- chasers of care, health plan medical directors, state and local public healthCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlEMPLOYERS AND BUSINESS 273 officials, clinicians, and consumer advocates \u2014identified 30 clinical and preventive services and groups of services recommended by the U.S. Preven-tive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 1 for average-risk patients (AHRQ, 2002). The relative value of these services was then assessed on the basis of twodimensions: health impact and value. Health impact refers to the portion ofdisease, injury, and premature death that would be prevented if the servicewas delivered \u2014that is, the clinical preventive burden. The value of the service refers to cost-effectiveness, in which the net cost of the service iscompared to its health impact. Cost-effectiveness provides a standard mea-sure for comparing services ' return on investment (ROI). The results of the assessment identified 14 services that employers may want to purchase toimprove the delivery of clinical preventive services (see Box 6 -1). The Part- nership for Prevention has disseminated its results to employers through itspublication Prevention Priorities: Employers ' Guide to the Highest Value Preventive Health Services (Partnership for Prevention, 2001b). The committee acknowledges the crucial role that employers, particu- larly large employers, play in creating health security for millions of Ameri-cans as providers of employer-based health insurance coverage and pur-chasers of health care services. It also notes that, to the extent that thequality improvement activities lead to improvements in the processes ofcare, these improvements should benefit not only the employees of specificcompanies but all people who use the health care system. In recent years, however, the current role of employer-sponsored health has been challenged. Some of the criticism points out that employers areunder no legal mandate to offer health insurance and that the employer isan unstable source of insurance for some employees, particularly those whowork for small firms or firms that hire a disproportionate number of low-income employees (Long and Marquis, 2001). Other criticism is directed atthe employer 's \"role\" per se (Reinhardt, 1999). A number of critics have argued that the employer should be removed from these decisions and thatthe employee, not the employer, should make decisions about what type ofinsurance to hold (Gavora, 1997; American Medical Association, 1999;Health Policy Consensus Group, 1999). In addition, critics point out thatalthough employees ultimately bear the cost of insurance through lowerwages, they are not aware of the trade-offs that are being made betweenwages and benefits and are demanding more benefits (or resisting costcontainment) because such benefits are viewed as being \"free\" (Pauly, 1986, 1 The USPSTF is a panel of independent experts in prevention and primary care tasked with identifying a core set of clinical preventive services known to improve health. TheUSPSTF recommendations are published in the Guide to Clinical Preventive Services , 2nd edition (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 1996), and most recent updated recommenda- tions are available at www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstfix.htm.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html274 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH 1997). Furthermore, critics point out that employer-sponsored health in- surance distorts the labor market by favoring large businesses over smallones, encourages employers to outsource certain workers, and affects work-ers' decisions about work and retirement (Congressional Budget Office, 1994; Gruber and Madrian, 1996). These critics recommend changes in taxpolicy so that tax incentives for the purchase of health insurance would notfavor employer-sponsored coverage Medi-cal Association, 1999; Health Policy Consensus Group, 1999). Until reforms are enacted to assure access to affordable health insurance for all Americans, the committee urges employers to continue to provide andimprove health insurance coverage for their employees. Employers should en-dorse the purchase of evidence-based benefits and work diligently to ensure thequality of the services that they purchase. The committee recommends that the federal government develop programs to assist small employers and employerswith low-wage workers to purchase health insurance at reasonable rates .BOX 6-1 Priorities for Employers: Recommended Clinical Preventive Services with High Health Impact and Value Vaccinate children: DTP/DTaP, MMR, oral polio/IPV, Hib, Hep B, varicella.

Healthy employees consume fewerbenefits in the form of benefit payments for medical care, short- and long-term disability, and workers ' compensation. Furthermore, healthy employ- ees are more productive than their nonhealthy counterparts because theyare absent less often and are more focused on their tasks while at work. Through health insurance premiums and self-insured plans, employers pay large sums of money for the treatment of diseases and disorders, manyof which are lifestyle related and often preventable. The leading causes ofdeath in the United States are heart disease, followed by cancer, stroke,chronic lower respiratory disease, accidents, diabetes, pneumonia/influenza,Alzheimer 's disease, nephritis, nephritic syndrome and nephrosis, and sep- ticemia (NCHS, 2002). A significant proportion of some of these diseasesand disorders can be attributed to lifestyle habits and behaviors. For ex-ample, one study suggests that about 57 percent of heart disease deaths, 37percent of cancer cases, 50 percent of strokes, 60 percent of accidents, 23percent of pneumonias, 34 percent of diabetes cases, 60 percent of suicides,and 70 percent of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis cases are related tohabits and behavior (NCHS, 1999). In the case of cancer and cardiovascu-lar disease, seven modifiable risk factors account for 23 and 65 percent ofthe cases of morbidity, respectively (Amler and Dull, 1987). More than 10,000 peer-reviewed articles in scientific journals show a clear causal relationship between specific modifiable risk factors and ad-verse health consequences. The following modifiable risk factors increaserates of mortality, morbidity, disability, and, in many cases, productivityloss: tobacco use, alcohol and drug use, sedentary behavior, poor nutrition,being overweight, having elevated serum cholesterol levels and high bloodpressure, exhibiting high levels of stress and hostility, a lack of social sup-port networks, and having unsafe sex. About half of all deaths in the UnitedStates are attributable to nine modifiable risk factors, including tobacco use(Box 6 -2), diet and activity patterns, alcohol use (Box 6 -3), firearm use, sexual behavior, motor vehicle accidents, and illicit drug use (McGinnisand Foege, 1993). Tobacco use alone caused approximately 440,000 pre-mature deaths annually from 1995 to 1999 (CDC, 2002). A number of studies have presented information on the distribution of illnesses in different companies. In a comprehensive study of Fortune 500companies, coronary artery disease was the most costly disease for employ-ers and represented 6.72 percent of total payments (Goetzel et al., 2000).The annual mean payment for claims related to coronary artery disease was$4,639 per patient and more than double the average payment of $2,230Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html276 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH BOX 6 -3 Creating Work Environments That Discourage Alcohol Misuse Drinking while at work and heavy drinking outside of work are a real headache for employers. Alcohol-related performance problems include absenteeism, tardi- ness, feeling ill at work, and sleeping. Alcohol misuse can undercut productivity(quality and quantity) and can aggravate problems between coworkers (Bernstein and Mahoney, 1989; Ames et al., 1997; Mangione et al., 1999). Health care costs for employees with alcohol problems are typically double those for other employees (Schneider Institute for Health Policy, 2001). Moreover, workers who drink even relatively small amounts of alcohol can raise the risk of alcohol-related death and injury in occupational accidents, especially if they drinkbefore operating a vehicle (Partnership for Prevention, 2001a). In 1994, more than 8 percent of full-time workers (more than 6.5 million employ- ees) engaged in heavy drinking, defined as five or more drinks on 5 or more daysin the past 30 days. To stem the cost of lost productivity, work-site accidents, and excess health care because of alcohol and drug use, employers can do the following: Offer health plans that cover the cost of screening, counseling, and treat- ment for substance misuse; Participate in community programs to prevent alcohol and drug misuse; Establish work-site alcohol and drug policies; Integrate alcohol prevention into existing work-site health promotion pro- grams; Educate supervisors about alcohol and drugs so they are better equipped to make caring and effective interventions and referrals;BOX 6 -2 Smoke-Free Policies in the Workplace Tobacco use is the number one cause of preventable disease and death in the United States (DHHS, 2000). Private-sector restrictions on smoking in the work-place are effective strategies that can make a difference for a significant number of employees. A comprehensive review of workplace smoking policies from the Na- tional Cancer Institute 's tobacco use supplement to the Current Population Survey found that slightly more than 80 percent of workers are covered by an official workplace smoking policy; however, less than half are protected by smoking poli- cies that prohibit smoking in both the work area and the public or common areas ofthe workplace (smoke-free policy). Furthermore, the study found that those work- ers who work indoors \u2014an estimated 58 million Americans, 40 million of whom are nonsmokers \u2014are not protected by a smoke-free workplace policy. These data suggest that access to smoke-free workplace environments could be improved (Gerlach et al., 1997).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlEMPLOYERS AND BUSINESS 277 for all conditions examined. These very large payments are for the treat- ment of heart disease and not its prevention. Other high-cost health conditions highlighted in the study of Fortune 500 companies either were caused by or were the consequence of lifestylefactors. Some were highly prevalent but the cost of treatment was relativelylow, such as diseases of the gastrointestinal tract (2.49 percent of totalpayments), essential hypertension (2.23 percent of total payments), andback disorders (2.07 percent of total payments) (Goetzel et al., 2000).Other conditions had lower prevalence rates but high average treatmentcosts and high total payments, such as cerebrovascular disease (1.65 per-cent of total payments) and cholecystitis and cholelithiasis (1.58 percent oftotal payments).BOX 6 -3 Continued Sponsor confidential employee assistance programs with on-site external counselors to help workers resolve substance abuse problems and link them with treatment services (especially those in safety-sensitive positions); and Educate employees about health problems associated with drinking and stress (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 1999; Partner- ship for Prevention, 2001a). The U.S. Department of Labor 's Working Partners program offers resources to help employers develop drug and alcohol-free workplaces (Partnership for Pre-vention, 2001a). Promoting Mental Health in the Workplace The employer community can take active steps to ensure that employees with depression remain productive. Estimates show that the annual cost of depressionin the United States due to work loss and work cutback reaches $33 billion (Green- berg et al., 1995). Evidence suggests that the gains in productivity from effective treatment for depression could far exceed the direct costs of treatment (Simon etal., 2001). Employers who cut back on mental health benefits face increased costs for non-mental health services and more sick days (Rosenheck et al., 1999). Therefore, the business community has an economic incentive to ensure the time-ly, high-quality treatment of depression in employees. One option is for businesses to become more active in improving employee awareness of the importance of the detection and treatment of depression. Anoth-er option is to require quality care for depression through private health insurance. Businesses increasingly finance mental health care for their employees through contracts with managed care organizations (OPEN MINDS, 1999). These con-tracts can be used as a means to require managed care organizations to improve the quality of care for depression via quality improvement programs.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html278 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH The analysis of Fortune 500 companies also uncovered costly mental health and substance abuse disorders that may be initiated or exacerbatedby stress. Bipolar disorders with major depressive episodes were the mostcostly (1.25 percent of total payments), followed by neurotic, personality,and nonpsychotic disorders (1.11 percent of total payments) and depres-sion (0.77 percent of total payments). Alcoholism, with an average cost of$3,012 per patient, is the most costly substance abuse disorder on a perpatient basis, although it accounts for less than 1 percent of total payments(Goetzel et al., 2000). A clear relationship exists between modifiable risk factors in a typical employed population and the employers ' health care expenditures for the treatment of the diseases and disorders caused by these risk factors. Forexample, in a study of 10,000 employees of the Control Data Corporation,researchers documented lower health care costs for employees who exer-cised regularly, ate nutritious foods, abstained from smoking cigarettes,and had low blood pressure (Brink, 1987). A 5-year study of SteelcaseCorporation employees showed that as modifiable health risks increasedfor employees, so did their medical expenditures (Yen et al., 1992). Anotherstudy examined the effects of 10 risk factors (obesity, high serum choles-terol levels, high blood pressure, stress, depression, smoking, inappropriatediet, excessive alcohol consumption, physical fitness and lack of exercise,and high blood glucose levels) on employer health care costs (Goetzel et al.,1998a; Anderson et al., 2000). The study examined medical claims for more than 46,000 employees from both private- and public-sector organizations for 6 years. These 10modifiable risk factors accounted for about 25 percent of all health careexpenditures for the six employers in the study (Anderson et al., 2000).Interestingly, the two risk factors with the greatest effect on health careexpenditures within 3 years were psychosocial: depression and stress. Healthcare expenditures for employees who reported depression were 70 percentgreater than those for employees not reporting depression. Health care ex-penditures for employees with high levels of stress were 46 percent greaterthan those for employees who did not have high levels of stress, after control-ling for demographics and other risk factors. When risk factors were com-bined, as they normally are for individuals at risk in multiple categories,health care expenditures increased to a far greater extent. For example, whenhealth care expenditures for individuals with multiple risks for heart disease(i.e., smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, high stress, sedentarylifestyle, and obesity [Box 6 -4], high blood glucose) were examined, they were found to be more than 200 percent greater than the expenditures forthose without these risk factors. Similarly, health care expenditures for indi-viduals at high risk for the two psychosocial risks, depression and stress, werenearly 150 percent greater than those for individuals lacking these risks.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlEMPLOYERS AND BUSINESS 279 Furthermore, there is growing evidence that these modifiable risk fac- tors not only increase health care costs but also increase worker absentee-ism and decrease on-the-job productivity (Golaszewski et al., 1989; Bertera,1991; Yen et al., Burton et al., 1999; Pronk et al., 1999; Edington,2001). One of these studies found a consistent relationship between obe-sity, stress, multiple risk factors, and subsequent health care expenditures(Aldana, 2001). A similar relationship existed between modifiable risk fac-tors and illness-related employee absenteeism. For an employer, the implications of this research are enormous. When all else is held constant, the risk profile for the population covered by theemployer 's medical plan and human resource policies can significantly af- fect labor costs. What options does an employer have for managing the riskof its labor pool? It cannot fire employees, for self-evident legal and ethicalreasons. However, the employer can institute risk reduction programs that,if successful, will significantly reduce the employer 's costs. One company undertook a study of the implications of undertaking a risk reduction program. In a study of 56,000 employees of Union PacificRailroad, investigators estimated that the company would save $20.7 mil-lion over 10 years compared with the amount that it would spend in a \"do- nothing \" scenario if it were able to reduce each of 10 modifiable riskBOX 6 -4 Obesity and Employers Employers represent another group of stakeholders adversely affected by the growing epidemic of obesity in America, but they also have ample opportunities to reverse this trend. As the problem of obesity in America grows, businesses areconfronted with escalating health care costs, missed days of work, lost productiv- ity, and much more. Because more than 134 million Americans (BLS, 2001) spend a majority of their day at work, businesses can help promote healthy lifestylesthrough work-site policies, changes in the physical and social work environment, educational programs, and connections with resources and programs in the sur- rounding community. Employers must first understand the direct and indirect costsof obesity and the return on investment that can be realized when obesity preven- tion and treatment strategies are implemented. Then, employers can communi- cate their commitment to helping employees be healthy by creating flexible workschedules that permit regular physical activity; providing healthy, accessible, and affordable food options at or near work; establishing on-site exercise facilities or creating incentives for employees to join or participate in other fitness-orientedactivities; working with health insurers to provide healthy eating and physical activ- ity counseling for all employees and their families; and offering incentives (e.g., time off and decreased insurance rates) to employees who participate in exerciseor weight maintenance programs.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

If risk reduction programs were even more successful and the risk factors werereduced by 1 percent per year, economic models predicted that the com-pany would save $77.4 million over 10 years. As a result of this study,senior management at Union Pacific Railroad decided that improving thehealth and productivity of its employees was a priority for the railroad andelevated this initiative to the status of a \"big financial deal \" in 2001 (Leutzinger, 2001). Changing the Health Risk Profiles of Employees In many ways, the workplace should be an ideal setting for the intro- duction and maintenance of health promotion and disease prevention pro-grams. Employees are concentrated in a finite number of geographic sites,they share a common purpose and a common culture, and communicationand information exchanges are relatively straightforward. Individual goalsand organizational goals are generally aligned with one another. Socialsupport is available when changes are tried, and organizational norms canencourage certain behaviors and discourage others. Financial or other in-centives can be introduced to encourage participation in programs, and theconsequences of the programs can be measured by using existing adminis-trative systems for data collection and analysis. Employers can also create aset of programs to encourage employees to participate in risk reductionactivities. It is important, however, that employers conduct health promo-tion activities and implement incentives programs in ways that assure non-discrimination and privacy for persons with disabilities. Nondiscriminationand privacy are required under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990and represent good practices for any employer. If the work site represents an ideal setting for changing people 's behav- iors and improving their risk profiles, do workplace health promotion anddisease prevention programs actually work? Can the workplace serve as acatalyst for health improvement and risk reduction? Certainly, a number ofcompanies have introduced workplace health promotion and disease pre-vention programs. Twenty years ago, less than 10 percent of U.S. businesseswith 50 or more employees offered some kind of health promotion ordisease prevention programs to their workforces. Today, many more com-panies are offering such programs. Twenty years ago there was little cred-ible evidence that such programs were effective. Companies invested inthem because they believed it was the right thing to do. Today 's employers are seeking information that these programs work to retain or enhancethem. There is increasing evidence that health promotion and disease preven- tion programs based in the workplace can change the behavior, psychoso-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Overall Cost Savings and Returns on Investment Employers are concerned not only whether health promotion and dis- ease prevention programs work in the sense that they can change the behav-ior, psychosocial risk factors, and biometric values for individuals employ-ees but also whether these programs save money overall. They are concernedabout whether investment in these activities has a positive rate of return. Growing evidence shows that well-designed and well-resourced health promotion and disease prevention programs can produce savings in medi-cal costs and possibly a positive rate of ROI in the program. The return oninvestment for health programs and for demand and disease managementprograms has been reported to range from $1.40 to $13 in benefits perdollar spent on the program, depending on the type of program (Goetzel etal., 1999). Traditional health promotion programs had a median return oninvestment of $3.14 per dollar spent; demand management programs had amedian return on investment of $4.50 per dollar spent; and disease man-agement programs achieved a median return on investment of $8.88 perdollar spent. Multiple-category programs that combined the elements ofhealth programs and demand and disease management programs achievedreturns on investment ranging from $5.50 to $6.50 per dollar spent, with amedian value of about $6 (Goetzel et al., 1999). Other studies report anaverage benefit -cost ratio of $3.48 for every dollar spent. For example, in one of the programs studied, Citibank invested $1.9 million in a healthpromotion program. It saved $8.9 million in medical expenditures as aresult of the program and realized a return on investment of $4.56 to $4.73per dollar spent (Ozminkowski et al., 1999, 2000). Additionally, the healthcare costs of participating employees with preexisting chronic medical con-ditions (heart disease, diabetes, back problems, and hypertension) were lessthan those of employees who did not participate. Need for More Information on the Effectiveness of Health Promotion Programs Although evidence indicates that workplace programs can work to reduce risk factors and that programs that are well designed can lead to costsavings, much still remains to be determined about such programs. Much more needs to be known about which interventions are the bestCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html282 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH for facilitating behavioral change and risk reduction. For example, although individualized risk reduction counseling is effective in creating behavioralchange, there are many ways of providing risk reduction counseling. How-ever, the most effective way of providing this service is not known. Doesthis intervention work best when delivered in person, by telephone, orthrough tailored print communication? Which messages work best forwhich people? What social factors can be brought into play? What is theideal balance between individual and group change processes? Should em-ployers use social marketing techniques to influence employee behavior? In addition to learning more about the effectiveness of specific interven- tion strategies, more needs to be known about how to structure theseprograms. Health promotion and disease prevention programs vary consid-erably in intensity, comprehensiveness, content, the communications mediaused, the staff involved, and other characteristics. Such programs includethe following components: Program awareness. Health promotion and disease prevention must be \"sold\" to eligible employees in the same way that Band-Aids, Tylenol, and detergents are sold. Eligible employees need to be aware, at an indi-vidual level, of the importance of health promotion and disease preventionand the availability of programs to address health risk factors. This isaccomplished through successful implementation of communications, pub-lic relations, and marketing programs. Participation. A large proportion of eligible employees must be engaged in the program and participate in its activities. Program participa-tion rates significantly affect program savings and estimates of return oninvestment because program expenses are typically spread across an entireeligible population, whereas program savings apply only to participants. Employee attitudes. Attitudes, health beliefs, feelings of being in control, readiness to change behaviors, stress management, and other psy-chosocial factors significantly influence an individual 's health and well- being (see also Chapter 2). Changing employee attitudes and altering be-havior are critical because a change in behavior cannot be maintainedunless individuals believe intrinsic psychological or social value is associ-ated with the change. Behavioral change and risk reduction. The extent to which corporate programs achieve significant and long-lasting changes in employee health andwell-being will influence the likely economic benefits that follow. Finally, more needs to be known about how to measure the effective- ness of such programs. The benefits of these programs should be measuredin terms of health care cost savings, decreases in absenteeism, and improve-ments in productivity. Absenteeism can be used to measure employee pro-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

As discussed earlier, health promotion and disease prevention activities have been shown to improve health and decrease costs, and oneindication of improved health may be a decrease in absenteeism. Employee health and productivity are apparently closely related, and effective management of one will positively affect the other (Goetzel et al.,1998b; Burton et al., 1999; Claxton et al., 1999; Cockburn et al., 1999).However, of the three benefits of these programs, measuring on-the-jobproductivity is the most difficult. On-the-job productivity losses are harderto measure than absenteeism because traditional ways of measuring pro-ductivity (i.e., counting the number of widgets produced per unit of time)are quickly becoming outdated as the U.S. economy changes from a manu-facturing economy to a service economy, in which quality is more impor-tant than quantity. Nonetheless, several tools and systems are under devel-opment to assess gains or losses in on-the-job productivity. These includeself-assessment tools, simulation studies, and sophisticated tracking andmonitoring systems (Reilly et al., 1993; Van Roijen et al., 1996; Endicottand Nee, 1997; Berger et al., 2001; Burton et al., 2001; Goetzel et al., 2001;Kessler et al., 2001; Lerner et al., 2001). Once these tools and systems areperfected, the potential impact of health promotion and disease preventionprograms on employee productivity and overall business performanceshould be easier to document. Results from these studies are expected toovershadow any savings realized from cost-cutting and expense manage-ment initiatives. Workplace Safety Programs Promoting the Health of Employees Promoting the health of the workforce requires a safe workplace and a healthy workforce. At the turn of the century, premature death often re-sulted from diseases, injuries, and unhealthy work conditions. The Depart-ment of Labor 's Bureau of Labor Statistics documented that 23,000 work- ers died from work-related injuries in 1913; this is equivalent to a rate of 61deaths per 100,000 workers (CDC, 1999). However, with the identificationof the etiologic factors that contribute to occupational health hazards andthe implementation of federal legislation to assure safe and healthy workingconditions, data from multiple sources indicate that work-related deaths,injuries, and illnesses have declined dramatically over time. In 1970, the Occupational Safety and Health Act was specifically framed \"to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the nation safe and healthful working conditions. \" That act established, in 1971, both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),which is part of the Department of Labor, and the National Institute forOccupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) (2000a), which is part of theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html284 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH OSHA was created to assure safe and healthy workplaces in America by enforcing workplace safety and health regulations (see Box 6 -5). Since 1971, workplace fatalities have been halved and occupational injury andillness rates have declined 40 percent. Over the same period, U.S. employ-ment nearly doubled from 56 million workers at 3.5 million work sites to105 million workers at nearly 6.9 million sites. OSHA forms cooperativerelationships with labor and management through Voluntary ProtectionPrograms, which \"recognize and promote effective safety and health man- agement \" at numerous sites around the United States and in more than 180 industries (OSHA, 2002b). These programs have resulted in millions ofdollars in savings each year because injury and illness rates have declinedbelow the averages for the industries at the participating sites. In addition,OSHA 's Strategic Partnership Program focuses on safety and health pro- grams and includes outreach and training components along with enforce-ment (OSHA, 2002a). Although the reductions in workforce injuries and the improvements in working conditions have been impressive, an average of 137 individuals dieBOX 6 -5 Federal Legislation to Promote Occupational Safety and Health The first federal legislation pertaining to occupational health and safety granted limited compensation benefits to civilian service workers for injuries sustained dur-ing employment (1908, Federal Workers ' Compensation Act). Subsequent legisla- tion established occupational health and safety standards for employees of federal contractors (1936, Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act) and regulations to protectmine workers (1969, Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act). The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 authorized the federal govern- ment to develop and set mandatory occupational safety and health standards andto establish the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to conduct research on workplace standards. The Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 re- quires industry to provide data on the production, use, and health and environmen-tal effects of chemicals. The act also led to the development of \"right-to-know \" laws, which provide employees with information on the nature of potential occupa- tional exposures. The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act) strengthened and expanded the rights of miners and enhanced the protection of miners from retalia- tion for exercising such rights. The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 established policy to ensure that pollution is prevented or reduced at the source, recycled or treated and disposed of, or released only as a last resort. The act also led to the substitution of less toxicsubstances in a wide range of industrial processes, with significant reductions in worker exposure to toxic substances.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Every 5 seconds a worker is injured; every 10seconds a worker is temporarily or permanently disabled (NIOSH, 1996). NIOSH is the only federal agency responsible for conducting research and making evidence-based recommendations on the prevention of work-related diseases and injuries. NIOSH is responsible for conducting researchon the full scope of occupational diseases and injuries, ranging from lungdisease in miners to carpal tunnel syndrome in computer users. In addition,NIOSH investigates potentially hazardous working conditions; makes rec-ommendations and disseminates information on preventing work-relateddiseases, injuries, and disabilities; and trains occupational safety and healthprofessionals. NIOSH data show that the direct and indirect costs of occupational injuries and illnesses are $171 billion annually for all businesses, comparedto \"$33 billion for AIDS, $67.3 billion for Alzheimer 's disease, $164.3 billion for circulatory diseases, and $170.7 billion for cancer \" (NIOSH, 2000b). NIOSH has brought together numerous organizations and individuals to focus on the creation of a research agenda. NIOSH and its public andprivate sponsors have developed the National Occupational ResearchAgenda (NORA) to provide a framework to guide the entire occupationalsafety and health community to help reduce the high toll of occupationalinjuries and illnesses. NORA priorities reflect a significant degree of con-currence among the large number of stakeholders. The priority researchareas have been grouped into three broad categories: disease and injury,work environment and workforce, and research tools and approaches (seeTable 6 -1). NIOSH and its partners, through NORA, will guide and coor- dinate research for the entire occupational safety and health community.Fiscal constraints on occupational safety and health research are increasing,however, making it important for NIOSH to focus on the topics that willbenefit workers and the nation and to ensure a coordinated research agenda. In addition to implementing NORA, NIOSH operates programs in every state to improve the health and safety of workers. NIOSH evaluatesworkplace hazards, builds state worker safety and health capacity throughgrants and cooperative agreements, funds occupational safety and healthresearch, and supports occupational safety and health training programs. Occupational safety and health programs are specific to the work site and operations. Programs usually focus on basic principles of control tech-nology that include engineering controls, work practices, personal protec-tive equipment, and monitoring of the workplace for emerging hazards.Work site safety and health training and a long-term commitment to suchprograms are also critical to achieving occupational safety and health goals.However, the majority of safety and health regulations and enforcementCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Therefore, small businesses face specific challenges in ensuring a safe and healthy workplace. Small employers employ more than half of the employees in private industry, and they experience higher levels of work-related hazards. Datafrom a survey of businesses in 1994 -1995 found that about one-third of all work-related deaths occur at workplaces with 10 or fewer employees, al-though they employ only 15 percent of all workers in private industry. Thechallenges to ensuring safe workplaces and healthy workers include a lackof onsite occupational safety and health professionals, difficulties in recog-nizing the magnitudes of specific hazards, and a lack of strategies for deal-ing with hazards in a small-business environment (NIOSH, 2002c). The importance of occupational hazard assessment and worker protec- tion is exemplified by the recovery, demolition, and site-clearing operationsat the World Trade Center (WTC) in the aftermath of September 11, 2001,when occupational hazard assessment and worker protection were critical.First-response workers \u2014firefighters, police, rescue workers, and volun- teers\u2014faced numerous occupational exposures, including fire and smoke, falling debris, and air contaminants such as asbestos, lead, silica, and vola-tile organic compounds, to name a few.

By September 21, 2002, about 800federal and state OSHA staffers and several private-sector Voluntary Protection Program volunteers from throughout the United States assisted in the following roles: Risk Assessment and Monitoring Taking more than 6,642 air and bulk samples to test for asbestos, silica, lead and other heavy metals, carbon monoxide, and numerous organic and inorgan- ic compounds. Noise testing was also conducted. Providing 24-hour laboratory support at the Salt Lake Technical Center to ana- lyze air and bulk samples taken at the site.

The committee also acknowledges that employers and employ-ees must continue to be vigilant and proactive in recognizing hazards in theworkplace. The committee encourages a greater sharing between large andsmall employers of the best practices and strategies that can reduce work-related mortality, injuries, and diseases and protect workers ' health. Other Workplace Policies That Promote Health Employers implement a number of policies related to family leave, flexible work practices, and other benefits and organize work (e.g., throughthe creation of teams and the assignment of multiple tasks) in ways thatmay have important health consequences. Employers implement some ofthese policies voluntarily; they implement others to comply with the law.For example, the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 requiresemployers with 50 or more employees to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaidleave for the birth or adoption of a child; to take care of a seriously ill child,parent, or spouse; and to recover from a serious illness. The business andpublic health sectors rarely consider these policies and practices as influen-tial determinants of health. Chapter 2 presents evidence that job character-istics, such as job demands and control, job insecurity, and issues related topart-time, shift work, and current practices on outsourcing have importanteffects on health. A range of policies related to work organization, theinterface between work and family, and long-term employment practiceshave often been evaluated for their effects on employee productivity andParticipating with contractors at the site to conduct job hazard analyses of unique operations to identify hazardous operations at the site and recommend ways to abate or reduce the hazards involved.

The committee believes that these same work practices, along with the more traditional concerns about occupational health and safetypractices, have important consequences for health. These types of private-sector policies may be among the most important determinants of popula-tion health. Evaluation of the effects of these policies and practices onhealth is a high priority. ROLE OF BUSINESSES AND INDUSTRIES IN PROMOTING A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT The private and public sectors significantly influence health when their goals are incompatible with conditions that promote healthy behaviors orphysical environments. When such goals are in conflict and significanthealth hazards arise, governmental agencies have a responsibility to act.Over the past 30 years, the U.S. government has passed numerous environ-mental laws and regulations to protect the health of the public (see Table6-2). These laws have often been passed in response to industrial contami- TABLE 6 -2 Selected Environmental Legislation Legislation Purpose Safe Drinking Water Act, 1974 Passed to protect the public from waterborne diseases, chemicals, and heavy metals in drinking water Clean Air Act Amendments, 1977 Established the regulatory structure and an enforceable timetable for reducing urban air pollution Clean Water Act, 1977 Sought to make rivers and lakes safe for fishing and swimming Comprehensive Environmental Passed in response to the contamination at Love Response, Compensation, and Canal, New York and Times Beach, Missouri Liability Act (Superfund statute), to protect communities from health dangers 1980 at hazardous waste disposal sites Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Enacted to require analysis of chemicals to Rodenticide Act, 1972, and which the public might be exposed through Toxic Substances Control Act, food and other pathways 1976 Toxics Release Inventory, 1987, Enacted to inform citizens about toxic mandated by the Emergency chemicals in the environment; it is also Planning and Community known as Title III of the Superfund Right-to-Know Act of 1986 amendments and is based on the premise that citizens have a right to know xxCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

In recent years, however, the roles of private-sector businesses and industry and of the public sector have become important in improving theenvironments of the communities in which they operate. Additionally, theprivate sector has formed partnerships with governmental agencies to helppromote the health of the public. One example is the Environmental Protection Agency 's (EPA 's) Design for the Environment (DfE) program. Through voluntary partnerships withbusinesses, industries, and others (e.g., public interest groups, universities,and research institutions), EPA provides businesses and industry with infor-mation to make environmentally informed choices regarding their prod-ucts, processes, and practices (EPA, 1998). According to EPA, the DfEprogram strives to promote the incorporation of environmental consider-ations into the traditional parameters of cost and performance on whichbusinesses base their decisions. Businesses and industries have come to realize that responsible entre- preneurship can play a major role in protecting human health by improvingthe environmental quality of the community through the efficient use ofresources and the minimization of waste. Businesses and industries aredeveloping techniques that reduce harmful environmental impacts. Somebusiness and industry leaders are also fostering openness and dialogue withemployees and the public and carry out environmental audits and assess-ments of their compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Anexample of a company initiative to improve community health is describedin Box 6 -7. Thus, investing in community and environmental health not only is an example of corporate responsibility but also can provide economic returnsto the business or industry. These programs succeed when there is a com-mitment from the leadership of the organization and, in many cases, whenthey are part of the business 's mission and vision statements. Another example is provided in Box 6 -8. The food and beverage industry generates products that may contribute to disease and disability if consumers make choices potentially incompat-ible with good health. In light of the intensifying obesity epidemic in theUnited States, the industry has been asked to work in partnership withother sectors to help consumers in their efforts to make healthier lifestyledecisions that will promote health by reducing obesity. In October 2002,the Health and Human Services Secretary, Tommy Thompson, and theAgriculture Secretary, Anne Veneman, met with officials from the NationalRestaurant Association and the National Council of Chain Restaurants tobegin a dialogue about how the food and beverage industries can help toreduce obesity. Potential strategies to be considered are delivering healthyfood choices, providing easy-to-understand nutritional information, inte-grating healthiness into mass-marketing strategies, and offering an increasedCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The third larg- est is in Midland, Michigan, with 550 buildings and 40 chemical production plants on a 1,900-acre facility. Air emissions were such that, in the late 1990s, the attitude and belief inside the company were that no further gains could be made in emis-sion control at the facility. However, Dow set two important goals: (1) to accrue by April 30, 1999, capital that could be used to cut waste and emissions by 35 percent and (2) to begin to foster institutional changes within Dow to shift the corporation 's thinking from compliance to pollution prevention and to further integrate health and environmental concerns into core business practices. Working with the community, activists, and pollution control consultants, Dow engineers identified pollution prevention opportunities. The result of this activity reduced waste and emissions by 12 million pounds per year, a 37 percent reduc- tion. Yet, the common belief in this facility had been that there were no cost-effective pollution prevention projects left to pursue. Ultimately, 17 projects were identified with a combined return on investment of 180 percent, or a savings of $5.4 million per year. BOX 6 -8 Intel: Improving Environmental Health Through Corporate Vision and Mission Intel, a manufacturer of microprocessors, changes it manufacturing processes every 2 years as it miniaturizes the next generation of microprocessors. Intel con- siders this an opportunity for environmental improvement, for example, throughchemical selection, facility design, waste management, ergonomics, and manufac- turing equipment selection. Other aspects of planning include projecting environ- mental health and safety impacts over 10 years, or five generations of manufactur-ing. It sets goals that must be integrated into the design and development processes. For example, Intel reduced water use by 40 percent in one process that uses hydrofluoric acid to etch wafers and achieved better management of the ex-haust, which reduced energy use. In another process, it recycled hazardous wastes and reduced emissions of volatile organic compounds. A key to Intel 's success in improving the environmental health of the communi- ty has been the company 's vision to develop a \"green \" plan that integrates design for the environment while aiming for sustainable activities as part of its operations.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The secretaries will also engage other organiza- tions in the attempt to help combat the obesity epidemic, including fruitand vegetable growers, grocery manufacturers, public health groups, andstate leaders through the National Governors ' Association and the Na- tional Conference of State Legislatures, as well as physical fitness groups(DHHS, 2002). This example shows how federal leadership can be used toencourage voluntary change. Other voluntary efforts, such as those madeto develop standards to protect children on the Internet, demonstrate thatindustries can be mobilized to deal with problems of social significance. Inthe absence of voluntary agreements, potential legislative and regulatorystrategies could be developed; for example, federal school lunch grantscould be contingent upon schools ' removal of soft drinks and other fast- food sources from junior high schools and high schools. A CASE FOR IMPROVING THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF COMMUNITIES Although the primary contribution of businesses to creating the condi- tions for health is the provision of jobs and creation of economic wealth,major employers as leaders of the business sector can also consider invest-ing in community health as an example of corporate social responsibility.The investment, in turn, can provide social and economic returns to thecompany. These programs succeed only if senior and middle managers viewthem as directly aligned with the company 's mission and vision. Company mission and vision statements, such as \"becoming the preferred employer in the community, \" \"attracting and retaining the best and brightest, \" and \"emphasizing worker safety above all else, \" can be leveraged by champions of health promotion and disease prevention programs to, very simply, \"help the company achieve its mission and vision. \" Beyond the theoretical, philosophical, or even emotional reasons for supporting investments in employee and community health, there are prac-tical reasons for these investments. A company, especially one that is largeand dominant, that assumes a leadership position in improving communityhealth and emphasizing disease prevention, health promotion, and account-ability is likely to stand out in that community and is likely to affect thenorms and practice patterns of health care practitioners for the better. Another rationale for increased employer leadership and corporate in- vestment in community health is the scarcity of mentally and physicallycapable employees able to take the place of employees who retire or volun-tarily leave the organization. This scarcity is most pronounced in the serviceand high-technology sectors, where \"knowledge workers \" are in high de- mand. Many companies have begun to invest in the educational infrastruc-tures of their communities to produce a large pool of well-educated andCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

A similar philosophy could be applied to health. Corporate investment in an im-proved community health infrastructure can create a larger pool of healthyand productive employees who are better able to face the physical andmental challenges of today 's work environment. Many corporate leaders seek to present an image of their companies as caring and responsible employers, and many companies try to distinguish themselves by being the preferred place to work (Johnson & Johnson,1989; Levering and Moskowitz, 1994; Goetzel et al., 1998b; Mercer, 2000;Fortune Magazine, 2002). Investing in health promotion and disease pre-vention can also expand a corporation 's social connections with the com- munity. Organizations that are actively engaged in their communities andthat act in socially responsible ways can also achieve a sense of purpose,relevance, social connectedness, and leadership in the community. They cando this by, for example, implementing no-smoking rules in buildings, incompany vehicles, in front of company premises, and at client meetings;instituting work -life balance policies such as flexible working hours and telecommuting; allowing employees to take time off to participate in healthpromotion programs; offering healthy food choices in workplace eatingfacilities; and limiting air and water pollution in the community. Somebusinesses have begun to offer employees computers and access to e-healthprograms (i.e., that use the Internet) to help them better manage their ownhealth (Box 6 -9). Organizations that are socially responsible and that exhibit a sense of caring for employees and the community can realize significant busi-ness gains as well, even when the gains are measured in traditionalaccounting terms. Across every financial outcome measured, sociallyresponsible businesses perform no worse and, perhaps, perform betterthan non-socially responsible firms (Stalling, 1998). Furthermore, con-sumers are more likely to purchase products from companies, such asBen & Jerry 's Ice Cream, that they believe are more socially responsible (Stalling, 1998) (see Box 6 -10). The reasons and incentives for companies to enhance their cooperation with the community described in this section have also been summarized byHelperin (2000) . The author notes that the public perception that \"your company is a good corporate citizen isn 't just for nice guys anymore; it 's for everyone. \" The involvement of corporations in aligning or branding them- selves with a social cause (i.e., a strategic, stakeholder-based approach tointegrating social issues into business strategy, brand equity, and anorganization 's identity) affects employee recruitment and retention, em- ployee morale, community and supplier relationships, public affairs, andthe company 's overall operating philosophy.

It has embraced its role as a participant in the publichealth system by strategically aligning itself with the Kaiser Family Founda-tion to launch a major media campaign to foster HIV awareness and pre-vention domestically and internationally (www.kff.org). This campaign isdescribed more fully in Chapter 7. Engaging Corporate Partnership in the Public Health System As discussed above, the arguments for corporate investment in promot- ing the health of workers and their communities are compelling. However,more must be done to encourage American business leaders to view them-BOX 6 -9 Ford Motor Company: Model E Program In February 2000, the Ford Motor Company, together with United Auto Workers leadership, launched the Model E Program for its employees. This program, thefirst of its kind, provides computer and Internet access to 350,000 Ford employees and their families in their homes for a nominal fee. The program is intended to help employees enhance their computer skills and comfort with the Internet environ-ment, as well as their access to Internet learning opportunities. Ford management also envisions benefits for the company: employees will gain a deeper understand- ing of customer needs, communications with plant workers who do not have desk-top computers will improve, and the costs of some human resource and other corporate services will be lower. By February 2002, 93 percent of employees had accepted the offer (Denise Clement, personal communication, February 4, 2002).Other companies have followed Ford 's lead in sponsoring employees to become computer savvy (e.g., Fleet Bank-Boston, General Motors and Daimler-Chrysler, Intel Corp., Ollin Corporation, and the U.S. Army) (www.hconline.org/industry.php). With large numbers of employees participating in the Model E Program, in July 2001 Ford moved to provide access to online tools that help empower employees in the management of their health. Through a licensing agreement, Ford providesaccess to the WellMed Personal Health Manager, a product of WellMed Inc., for 170,000 U.S.-based Ford employees and their families. According to WellMed: The product allows employees and their families to assess, record and improve their health on a daily basis. It includes general and gender-specific health risk assessmenttools that cover past health issues, family history, and lifestyle habits; a secure locationfor individuals to create, gather, and store health records; a source of education infor-mation on conventional and alternative treatment options for important health topicssuch as allergies, asthma, depression, diabetes, cancer, and stress; and interactive,self-paced programs designed to assist individuals in achieving positive, healthfulchange such as quitting smoking, improving nutrition and fitness, or preparing for a healthy pregnancy.

One of Mellon 's projects is the Community Bridge Project, a model designed to show how local businesses can partner with other agencies to address critical social and economic issues in their communities. Community Bridge Project The program model calls for the formation of community advisory committees consisting of business managers, educators, human services professionals, andlocal residents. The committees will assess their communities ' business climates and recruit a pool of local residents willing to volunteer as mentors for welfare clients. A Penn State Cooperative Extension Program facilitator will be hired tocoordinate existing extension resources and to work with volunteer mentors. Men- tors will be trained to offer support and guidance for clients, helping them to identify workable strategies for improving their circumstances. Participants will also undergo employment skills assessments and take part in appropriate job skills training. In addition, clients will receive help in matching their current skills to available training opportunities in the community, and they will becoached to match employment goals with realistic employment opportunities.

Representatives from potential new businesses explore factors such as competition, wages, cost of living, and the employee base, as well as the educational system, economic devel-opment potential, and the attitude of the community. The association and other Schuylkill County partners recognize that collaborative efforts are needed to bring new resources to the communities but note that a community does not have to bebig to be successful (McAullife, personal communication, 2001). GTE GTE, which has recently merged with Bell Atlantic to form Verizon, is a found- ing member of the Georgia Healthcare Leadership Council. The council is an orga- nization of managed care plans and local employers such as Delta Air Lines, Geor-gia Pacific, Lockheed, GTE, UPS, and pharmaceutical companies. Its goal is to improve the medical care provided to Atlanta residents. The primary focus of the council, formed in the fall of 1999, has been the development of preventive carestandards based on evidence-based medicine. The council distributed posters to 3,500 metropolitan Atlanta doctors outlining standard prevention measures for children and adults. Upcoming initiatives include issuing guidelines for women 's health and standardizing treatments for asthma and allergies. GTE also has provided funding to support a Washington Business Group on Health project, Community Partnerships to Prevent Violence. The project will cre-ate a forum consisting of Texas-based employers; community organizations; school, mental health, and public health organizations; and parents. Its objective is to jointly develop strategies for businesses to assist parents (including their ownemployees) and schools in working to prevent school and youth violence. Forum participants will assess the community 's inherent ability to work cooperatively on these issues and identify their roles and responsibilities in meeting this challenge.The participants will develop a set of goals and recommendations. They will also identify resources to share, such as information to be provided to parents on iden- tifying risk behavior, working with school personnel on children 's emotional and behavioral issues, and identifying community resources for children who need educational, mental health, and other services (WBGH, 2000). 3M A core value at 3M is to embrace a commitment to strengthening the commu- nities that are home to 3M locations.

Groups such as the Washington Business Group on Health are leading efforts to identify strat-egies to build greater collaboration between corporate leaders and govern-mental public health agencies. In 1999, the Washington Business Group on Health hosted a public health forum for employers that brought together large employers andgovernmental public health leaders to discuss maternal and child health. Asummary of the findings from the forum highlights the difficulties thatemployers and public health agencies must overcome if collaborative ac-tions toward common health goals are to be achieved (WBGH, 2000).These findings include: 1. Employers and governmental public health agencies have had little interaction; this situation needs to change, and both will benefit from sucha change. 2. There is a need for a common language and for dialogue among public health employers about issues related to health care costs. 3. Employers need data on pressing community health problems, but the data gathered need to be interpreted in ways that are meaningful tocorporate health leaders. 4. There are significant limits to both the extent and the efficacy of employee health education. 5. There is a need to improve employee utilization of preventive health services that are covered but not being accessed by employees. The findings from the forum also noted that partnership and collabora- tion could bring needed public health expertise to employers and businessexpertise to public health agencies (WBGH, 2000). Governmental public health officials and business leaders would ben- efit from a formal dialogue on the health issues facing communities and theworkforce. For example, corporate leaders should be invited to participatein community assessments and health planning and promotion activities(see Chapter 4). Such communication with corporate leaders and the par-ticipation of corporate leaders would allow the exchange of data on em-ployee health as well as population-based health data from the communitythat are interpreted in ways that are meaningful to both public healthofficials and corporate health leaders. Such a dialogue would also providethe public health community with a better understanding of the processesthat business leaders use to diagnose problems, review options, make deci-sions, and implement actions. Business leaders would gain a better under-standing of the reasoning behind public health statutes, regulations, andother requirements that may affect businesses. Moreover, such a dialogueCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The scientific basis of the health promotion and disease prevention programs needs to be better explained so that employers can better deter-mine the most effective and efficient strategies to promote and sustainemployee health, lower costs, and increase worker productivity. The publichealth community, the business community, and philanthropies may allplay a role in such an effort. Public health researchers and philanthropiescould be active partners in helping employers who want to develop, man-age, and evaluate these types of programs. Strong communications strategies must be developed to disseminate information on the costs (to employers and businesses) of modifiablehealth risk factors and the evidence-based interventions available to re-duce these risk factors. This is especially critical if employees (as noted inthe forum of the Washington Business Group on Health) are not takingadvantage of covered preventive services. The corporate world is alreadysteeped in marketing techniques but could benefit from the social market-ing and media advocacy strategies described in Chapter 7 to motivatebehavioral change among individuals (e.g., to increase the levels of use ofpreventive services) or to change public policies that would contribute toa healthier community and workforce (e.g., support educational programsin the community). In addition to contributing to the health of employees and communi- ties, greater corporate engagement in the public health system can improvepublic opinion about companies. A 2000 Business Week /Harris Poll ex- plored Americans ' views of corporate America. Two findings are of par- ticular relevance to this discussion. When asked to rate large U.S. employerson \"really caring about what is good for America, \" 25 percent of respon- dents answered \"pretty good \" and 7 percent answered \"excellent. \" The remaining 66 percent answered only \"fair\" or \"poor. \" Respondents were also asked to show their agreement with one of the following two state-ments: (1) \"U.S. corporations should have only one purpose \u2014to make the most profit for their stakeholders \u2014and the pursuit of that goal will be best for America in the long run \" and (2) \"U.S. corporations should have more than one purpose. They also owe something to their workers and the com-munities in which they operate, and they should sometimes sacrifice someprofit for the sake of making things better for their workers and communi-ties\" (Business Week, 2000). The respondents were almost unanimous (95 percent) in agreeing with the second statement. Recognition of exemplary corporate responsibility can affect the public 's view of a company 's social responsibility and corporate reputation. A number of programs recognize corporations for their investments, andseveral partnerships between governmental and nongovernmental bodiesCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlEMPLOYERS AND BUSINESS 299 recognize corporate efforts. For example, EPA, the Department of Energy, and the Center for Resource Solutions sponsor the Green Power LeadershipAward, which recognizes the actions of organizations that advance thedevelopment and use of renewable energy sources. The Ron Brown Awardfor Corporate Leadership is a presidential award that rewards corporateleadership for promoting employees ' development and well-being and for enhancing the communities where the employers work and live. For thepast 10 years, the C. Everett Koop National Health Award, sponsored bythe Health Project, 2 has been presented to U.S. companies that have docu- mented improved employee health and cost savings from the health promo-tion and disease prevention programs at their work sites (Tully, 1995;Ziegler, 1998, 1999). The committee recommends that the corporate community and public health agencies initiate and enhance joint efforts to strengthen health pro-motion and disease and injury prevention programs for employees and theircommunities. As an early step, the corporate and governmental publichealth community should: a. Strengthen partnership and collaboration by Developing direct linkages between local public health agen- cies and business leaders to forge a common language andunderstanding of employee and community health problemsand to participate in setting community health goals and strat-egies for achieving them, and Developing innovative ways for the corporate and governmen- tal public health communities to gather, interpret, and ex-change mutually meaningful data and information, such as thetranslation of health information to support corporate healthpromotion and health care purchasing activities. b. Enhance communication by Developing effective employer and community communication and education programs focused on the benefits of and optionsfor health promotion and disease and injury prevention, and Using proven marketing and social marketing techniques to promote individual behavioral and community change. 2 The Health Project is a White House-initiated public -private partnership of health care leaders dedicated to improving family, individual, and community health through programs that are also proven to reduce overall costs.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html300 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH c. Develop the evidence base for workplace and community interven- tions through greater public, private, and philanthropic investments in re-search to extend the science and improve the effectiveness of workplace andcommunity interventions to promote health and prevent disease and injury. d. Recognize business leadership in employee and community health by elevating the level of recognition given to corporate investments in em-ployee and community health. The Secretaries of DHHS and the Depart-ment of Commerce, along with business leaders (e.g., chambers of com-merce and business roundtables), should jointly sponsor a CorporateInvestment in Health Award. The award would recognize private-sectorentities that have demonstrated exemplary civic and social responsibilityfor improving the health of their workers and the community. CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS Strong partnerships among governments, communities, philanthropies, and the corporate community to facilitate actions to improve the health ofemployees and their communities are critical for the public health system toachieve its goals. These partnerships could stimulate national debate andcommentary to draw more attention to the importance of health promotionand disease and injury prevention in improving the health of the nation.Such partnerships could also serve to identify the incentives that can beused as tools to further engage the corporate community in providing high-quality programs that promote employee and community health and todevelop shared actionable strategies to achieve the vision of healthy peopleliving in healthy communities.

All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html3077 Media Mass media plays a central role in people's lives. Its importance is evident in the amount of time people spend watching television, surfing theWorld Wide Web, listening to music, and reading newspapers and maga-zines. The delivery of information through mass media is instant and avail-able around the clock. The proliferation of communication technologies\u2014miniature TVs, handheld radios, and personal computer companions suchas Blackberry and Palm Pilot\u2014contribute to the omnipresence of the mediain daily life. More and more, a growing proportion of \"life experience\" ismediated through communication technologies instead of being directlyexperienced or witnessed. The public health community and policy makersoften do not appreciate the importance and power of the media in shapingthe health of the public. More importantly, media outlets or organizationsdo not see themselves as a part of, or contributing to the public healthsystem. As this chapter discusses, however, the media plays a number ofroles in educating the public about health issues and has a responsibility toreport accurate health and science information to the public. In this chapter, the committee examines the potential role of the media as an actor in the public health system, that is, how it can use its presenceand power to lead to the mobilization of societal action that creates theconditions for health. The chapter specifically discusses how the news me-dia can place health issues on the national public agenda and can catalyzeaction at the national and local levels. The chapter also addresses howadvertising media, entertainment media, and the Internet provide health-related information that can reinforce or alter norms and attitudes thatCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The chapter concludes with a brief discussion of the theories that help us understand the impact ofthe media on behavioral change and on evaluation and research issues,including the difficulties in predicting the outcomes of media campaigns.The committee recommends a number of steps that can be taken to furtherenhance the role of the media in improving the population 's health. NEWS MEDIA AND THE NATIONAL PUBLIC AGENDA The ubiquitous nature of the news media, in particular, makes it a powerful tool for directing attention to specific issues. Generally, Ameri-cans look to the news media for coverage of events and to help us under-stand the world around us. Although the news media does not specificallytell us what to think, it plays an important role in identifying what issues weshould think about (McCombs and Shaw, 1972). The more coverage atopic receives in the news, the more likely it is to be a concern of the public.Conversely, issues not mentioned by the media are likely to be ignored or toreceive little attention. The unfolding news coverage of HIV/AIDS provides a good example of how an important health issue may be invisible to the public eye until themedia bring it to light. The first publicly documented cases of AIDS werereported in the June 5, 1981, issue of Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR ) (CDC, 1981a). The publication provided five case histo- ries of previously healthy, young (ages 29 to 36) homosexual men from theLos Angeles area who developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), an affliction usually seen in severely immunodepressed patients, and amyriad of other opportunistic infections. A July issue of MMWR (CDC, 1981a) reported Kaposi 's sarcoma in 26 homosexual men and additional cases of PCP in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Physicians were alertedabout Kaposi 's sarcoma, PCP, and other opportunistic infections associated with immunosuppression in homosexual men. A subsequent issue ofMMWR (CDC, 1982c) reported 70 additional cases of Kaposi 's sarcoma and PCP, and by December 1981, the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC) had reported more than 150 deaths. During this time, news media coverage of the illnesses that appeared to be affecting homosexual men was limited. According to an analysis con-ducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation (1996), it was only in August 1982that the New York Times brought readers up to date on an emerging and puzzling health crisis in the homosexual community. The article, \"A Disease 's Spread Provokes Anxiety, \" used the term acquired immune defi- ciency syndrome , or AIDS, for the first time. Later that year, the Washing- ton Post reported on the death of an infant who had received a transfusion of blood from a donor with AIDS (CDC, 1982b). By 1983, a NewsweekCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlMEDIA 309 poll found that 9 in 10 Americans over 18 years of age had heard about AIDS but were generally uninformed or misinformed. Subsequent coverageof AIDS included several newsmaker and public interest stories that furtherincreased the public 's concern about AIDS. News media coverage during the mid- to late 1980s may have contrib- uted to improved public awareness and knowledge of AIDS. By 1989,Gallup surveys indicated that nearly all adults were aware that HIV, thevirus that causes AIDS, can be transmitted by shared needles (98 percent),homosexual intercourse (96 percent), and heterosexual intercourse (95 per-cent) (Kaiser Family Foundation, 1996). Table 7 -1 gives examples of the media coverage of AIDS from 1985 to 1993. The media also play an important role in gaining the attention of specific opinion leaders, including politicians, governmental regulators,community leaders, and corporate executives, among others. Between 1982TABLE 7 -1 Media Coverage of AIDS Year News Story October 1985 Death of Rock Hudson, a well-known public figure August 1987 Florida family burned out of home; a dramatic case of public anxiety concerning AIDS leading to violence.

All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html310 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH and 1987, several members of the U.S. Congress placed AIDS on the politi- cal agenda by holding hearings on the growing numbers of people afflictedby it and research into its causes and prevention. Celebrity activists andspokespersons covered by the media also increased the visibility of AIDS onthe political agenda. However, it was not until 1987 that President RonaldReagan gave his first public speech about AIDS. During that year the Con-gress also passed legislation that took into account the larger societal impli-cations of the epidemic and that went beyond funding for AIDS prevention,research, and treatment efforts. The AIDS Federal Policy Act of 1987 pre-vented discrimination against individuals with disabilities \u2014including those with HIV/AIDS. In 1988, as public recognition of the burgeoning AIDS epidemic in- creased, the growing need for information was addressed by a booklet sent toall 107 million U.S. households by then-Surgeon General C. Everett Koop.Understanding AIDS: A Message from the Surgeon General was one of the largest educational public health mailings in U.S. history (Koop, 2002). Political attention to AIDS continued to grow from the late 1980s through 1990. Advocacy groups and celebrities used news media coverageto bring attention to the case of Ryan White, an Indiana teenager whoacquired AIDS through blood products used to treat his hemophilia, and toAIDS issues in general (AIDS Project Los Angeles, 2001). In August 1990,the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources (CARE) Act was enacted,a few months after Ryan 's death. This landmark legislation authorized funds in emergency relief to cities devastated by the AIDS epidemic (P.L.101-381). As noted earlier, a high level of media coverage about a topic elicits public attention and concern. In the case of HIV/AIDS, the news mediaengaged public attention and stimulated policy response. Shuchman (2002)provides several examples of journalism as a catalyst of health care systemchange. A New York Times probe of fraudulent practices at the Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. chain of hospitals in March of 1997 led to a federalcriminal investigation of the company (Gottlieb et al., 1997). A Los Ange- les Times series on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 's system of drug approval in 2000 strengthened the claims of those advocating tightercontrols at the agency (Willman, 2000). Extensive coverage by the Wash- ington Post and others of the death of a young patient in a university- based gene therapy experiment resulted in stronger federal protections forpatients enrolled in clinical trials (Nelson, 2000). A Boston Globe series on the hazards of placebo-control trials in psychiatry was one of several journalistic investigations that resulted in changes in the way psychiatricpatients are enrolled in research protocols (Whitaker and Kong, 1998) (quoted in Shuchman, 2002).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlMEDIA 311 News attention to specific issues, however, may also distort public perceptions and change behavior in adverse ways. Gilliam and colleagues(1995) found that the public 's concern regarding crime increased, despite little actual change in the frequency of criminal activity and national surveystatistics indicating a declining population-adjusted rate of crime over theprevious two decades. The authors note that although Americans do notexperience crime directly, they receive large doses of crime coverage fromthe media. The authors suggest that such coverage drives Americans toname crime as the most important problem facing the country and shapespublic attitudes toward criminals, the death penalty, mandatory jail sen-tences, and \"three strikes \" laws. In response to public concerns, policy makers endorse strategies to strengthen law enforcement and the criminaljustice system. Dorfman and Thorson (1998) also note that one by-productof media reporting on crime and violence is that readers receive a distortedpicture of the world and that people react to reading and hearing newsabout crime and violence by fearing their world. Dorfman and colleagues(2001) have developed techniques to enable journalists to report on highlyunusual crimes without misrepresenting the patterns of violence in theircommunities and creating misguided fears. Such techniques for reportingon violence integrate a public health perspective and offer readers informa-tion to understand the determinants of violence and to develop strategiesfor reducing violence in the community (Stevens, 1998). NEWS MEDIA AS A CATALYST TO PROMOTE HEALTH AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL The AIDS example illustrates the role of the news media in placing the AIDS epidemic in the public light and on the national political and legisla-tive agendas. The news media can also function as a catalyst for action atthe local or community level. The story of \"motel families \" living across the street from Disneyland in Orange County, California, demonstrates thepower of the news media to highlight social issues and stimulate action bylocal government and community members. Over a period of 6 months in 1998, Laura Saari, a writer for the Orange County Register , brought to light the sharp social and economic contrast that exists in one of California 's more affluent counties, where one in five children lives in poverty. The article on motel children uses the voicesof children to poignantly communicate the impact of poverty on their lives(see Box 7 -1). The story had a significant influence on the community; more that 1,100 people contacted the paper to offer $200,000 in donations, 50 tonsof food, 8,000 toys, and thousands of volunteer hours. The media coveragealso activated a response by the local government. The Orange CountyCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

A broken fan, onion peels, a gravy-stained box from a Salisbury steak TV din- ner, a can of Hype Morning Rush Energy. \"A toy bucket,\" shouts Jeffrey Littlefield, 6. He wiggles a stick to get to the bucket before the other kids. He pulls up a fast-food chicken pail and smiles. Two black teeth. \"I'm fishin',\" he says. \"It's a contest, whoever gets the most cans.\"\"Can I help?\" asks Anthony Chavez, 3, trying to climb up. \"I see French fries!\" says a girl. She jumps in. The children live at a motel across from Disneyland.There was a time when tourists checked into motels such as this one, drawn to the U-Dial telephones and color TVs and a balcony view of the Happiest Place on Earth. Today, the vacancy signs are still up, but their neon tubes have lost their gas. Newer high-rise hotels lure the vacationers. And so the old rooms-by-the-day have become $140 rooms-by-the-week that soon become rooms-by-the-year, even though everyone always says they're mov- ing out tomorrow. For families who can't find a way into the county's rental market, the motels are the last stop before the homeless shelter or the street. And it's not just here. A healthy economy and rising home prices have driven families across the nation into motels. Often, the buildings are in decay. The ceilings fall, the locks don't latch, and the roaches don't wait until dark. Some families live six or more people to a room. For the hundreds of children living in Orange County motels, violence often is a thin wall away, if that. Drug deals, prostitution, stabbings, assaults, theft, an occa- sional murder, a fugitive in hiding. The children are transient. Because of new occupancy limits in some cities, families must move on after 28 days. Social workers who are trying to protect the children often have difficulties just finding them, says Michael Riley, director of Orange County Children and Family Services. At some schools near motels, a third of the kids who sign up in the fall aren't there at the end of the year. Head lice are chronic. Nurses have found roaches lodged deep inside children's ears. \"These children are consumed, 24 hours a day,with poverty\u2014and it's not just financial,\" says Linda Dunlap, a nurse whose volun- teer group, Project Dignity, works with families in motels. \"It's spiritual and emo- tional. They didn't just decide one day they were going to surrender their spirits.They did it to survive.\" The little ones seem too wise for their years, and too angry. Yet they share their last piece of bread with a neighbor. They protect each other fiercely. They try tocreate order where there is none.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlMEDIA 313 Board of Supervisors ordered an audit of services for motel children and directed $1 million in funds to create a housing program to help familiesmove out of motels (Leaman, 1998). A nonprofit agency launched a $5million capital campaign for a shelter to help motel families with drugabuse problems. The city of Anaheim, where the motels are located, alsomoved services into the motels so that families would have easier access toparenting classes, job training, and food programs. Many public health issues are not considered newsworthy. In contrast to the coverage of a frightening infectious disease epidemic such as AIDS or,more recently, the anthrax attacks, the story on motel children illustratesthe everyday work of public health that involves struggles with endemicconditions and risk factors that are not considered news. The journalist wasable to capture interest in an endemic situation by presenting the story in anovel way, and subsequent advocacy helped to keep the story and thepublic interest alive. NEWS MEDIA COVERAGE AND HEALTH INFORMATION Although news media coverage can help place a specific health issue on the national agenda, tensions exist among news reporters, scientists, andpublic health professionals as they seek to convey health news and informa-tion to the public, especially during a crisis. It is important to understandthese tensions if the news media is to be involved in the public healthsystem. The results of a survey of scientists and journalists are particularly helpful in understanding the attitudes of each toward the other and theirIn grade school, many children are still hanging onto their dreams of what their lives could be. By the time they are teenagers, anger often has hardened into resentment, hopelessness, defiance. \"I think the general population doesn 't under- stand what kind of lifestyle is being led in these places, \" says Sgt. Joe Vargas of the Anaheim Police Department. \"These are toxic communities. The kids are really starving for stability, and they don't get it. We 're breeding criminals. We 're breeding kids who are growing up without the life skills necessary to function to their full potential. \" That is the way grown-ups see life in motels. But things look different when you're a kid. SOURCE: Saari (1998). Excerpted with permission of the Orange County Register .BOX 7 -1 ContinuedCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html314 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH views on transmitting and translating scientific information through the media to the public. Hartz and Chappell (1997) found that scientists com-plained that reporters do not understand many of the basics of their meth-ods, including the proper interpretation of statistics, probabilities, and risk.Journalists viewed scientists as being too immersed in esoteric jargon andunable to explain their work simply and cogently, whereas scientists saidthe news media oversimplify complex issues. Reporters also noted thatscientists do not understand that \"news \" is a perishable commodity that must be made relevant to the reader and viewer (see Table 7 -2). These findings allude to many of the tensions between the scientific community (including the public health community) and the journalismcommunity that arise because of differences in defining what is newswor-thy, differences in styles of communication (Nelkin, 1996, 1998; Hartz andChappell, 1997), and differences in perceptions about the role of the media(Nelkin, 1996, 1998). In identifying newsworthy topics, journalists often seek out stories that are potential attention grabbers. The tenets of newsworthiness include con-troversy, broad interest, injustice, irony, local \"peg,\" personal angle, break- through, anniversary peg, seasonal peg, celebrity peg, and visuals that canmake the story interesting (Wallack et al., 1999). Scientists and public health professionals believe that journalists, in writing attention-grabbing stories, often violate the traditional norms thatguide scientific communication. Nelkin (1996, 1998) notes that media con- TABLE 7 -2 Scientists ' and Journalists ' Agreement with Various Negative Statements About the News Media Scientists ' Journalists ' Agreement Agreement Statement (%) (%) Few members of the news media understand the nature of 91 77 science News media reporters are ignorant of the process of 69 46 science News media reporters cannot interpret results 66 48 News media reporters overblow risks 61 45News media reporters rarely get details right 56 62 Member of the media seek the sensational 76 69 Members of the news media focus on the trendy 79 67News media reporters focus on personalities, not on 49 70 findings News media reporters want instant answers 75 52 SOURCE: Hartz and Chappell (1997).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Journalists, on the other hand,often see the use of caveats or qualifications as information that can bedismissed to improve the readability of a story. Furthermore, journalisticefforts to enhance audience interest may violate other traditional scientificnorms. For example, to create a human interest angle, journalists may lookfor personal stories and individual cases, although this may distort researchfindings that have meaning only in a broader statistical context. Scientific journals may also contribute to the distortion of research findings. Scientific journals often prepare press releases for the news mediato assist them in getting the story right. These attempts to translate researchinto news can be misleading. Woloshin and Schwartz (2002) reviewed thecontent of journal press releases and interviewed press officers at nineprominent medical journals. The study found that press releases do notroutinely highlight study limitations or the role of industry funding. For-mats for presenting data were also found to exaggerate the perceived im-portance of findings. Fueling these tensions is the fact that scientists, health care profession- als, and policy experts rarely receive training in public communication, andreporters are not well trained in science, medicine, and statistics. Bothgroups are generally untrained in risk communication. A recent study (Voss, 2002) highlights reporters ' self-perceptions about their own ability to report health news. The study surveyed report-ers and newspapers in five Midwestern states. In response to questionsabout reporting ability, 49.7 percent of respondents reported it was some-times easy and sometimes difficult to understand key health issues, and 31percent found it often or nearly always (2.7 percent) difficult to do. Also,51.3 percent of respondents reported that it was sometimes easy or some-times difficult to interpret statistical data, whereas 27.4 percent found itoften or nearly always (6.2 percent) difficult. More than three-quarters ofrespondents (83 percent) reported that they had no training to coverhealth topics. Similarly, a national survey of journalists and news execu-tives found that only 12 percent of reporters covering health care areviewed as \"extremely prepared \" and 43 percent are viewed as \"prepared \" to cover health care issues (Foundation for American Communications,2002). To help ease these tensions and to improve the quality of the informa- tion delivered to the public, scientists and public health officials as well asjournalists and editors should seek opportunities for training. The need formedia training is acknowledged in the statement of Al Cross, President ofthe Society of Professional Journalists, who notes that \"training is a good way to meet your public responsibilities \" (quoted in Kees, 2002) and in theCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html316 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH words of Melinda Voss, executive director of the Association of Health Care Journalists: It seems to me that it is more important than ever that we as journalists really know how to do our jobs right, because so many critical policydecisions are being made that affect everyone. The ability to properly report medical studies and survey research and the ability to interpret statistics are all a part of doing the job right. We owe it to our audiences.(quoted in Kees, 2002) In response to the need for better health and science reporting, govern- mental agencies and foundations have developed programs for journaliststhat seek to provide them with experiences that will deepen their subjectmatter knowledge and strengthen their reporting. With funding from theJohn S. and James L. Knight Foundation, the CDC Foundation sponsorsthe Knight Journalism Fellowship at CDC (CDC Foundation, 2002). Thefellowship provides classroom instruction in epidemiology and biostatis-tics, public health intervention, public health structure, and health report-ing. Fellows are also provided with opportunities to observe investigationsof disease outbreaks and participate in research and field practice (http://www.cdcfoundation.org/fellowships/knight/fellowship.html). The Kaiser Family Foundation (2002b) sponsors three fellowship pro- grams for journalists. The Kaiser Media Fellowships in Health provide print or broadcast journalists and editors interested in health issues with an annualstipend that allows them to pursue individual projects on a wide range ofhealth and social policy issues. The Kaiser Media Internships in Urban Healthprovide minority journalists interested in urban public health reporting withpractical experiences in reporting on the health beat. The Kaiser Media Mini-Fellowships provide travel and research grants to journalists to research andreport on health policy and public health issues. Both the Kaiser FamilyFoundation and the CDC-Knight fellowships, as well as others, 1 facilitate a healthy dialogue between health officials and reporters and contribute to thedevelopment of a well-trained cadre of health journalists. Journalist associations also have begun to take a lead in providing opportunities for journalists to improve the quality of information theyprovide to the public. The Association of Health Care Journalists (AHCJ),for example, is an independent, nonprofit organization dedicated to ad-vancing public understanding of health care issues. Its mission is to improvethe quality, accuracy, and visibility of health care reporting, writing, andediting. One of the ways the association works to enhance the understand- 1 Although not dedicated specifically to health issues, the Pew Charitable Trusts sponsors the Fellowships in International Journalism (www.pewfellowships.org), which may cover health issues in other countries.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

With support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation,the association recently published Covering the Quality of Health Care \u2014A Resource Guide for Journalists (AHCJ, 2002b). The importance of effective communication among public health offi- cials, the media, and the public is particularly critical during crises. Duringsuch times, the news media play an important role in amplifying or attenu-ating the public 's perception of risk and serve as a key link in the risk communication process. The media played a key role in reporting the an-thrax attacks following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Theevents emphasized the need to communicate scientific and medical informa-tion in a way that the public can understand and to provide clear informa-tion about the concepts of risk and how to apply them. In November 2001, Dr. Kenneth Shine, president of the Institute of Medicine, advised Congress that communication to the public and to healthprofessionals about the anthrax terrorist attack were found to be insuffi-cient and needed improvement to deal more effectively with future situa-tions that may compromise public health or national security. He stated: Within the Department of Health and Human Services, there must be a single credible medical/public health expert spokesperson that reports reg-ularly, most likely daily, to the American people in regard to an outbreak with national significance. This is analogous to the situation in local com- munities where there is a need for such an individual to communicate onbehalf of the local health department. Several months before the anthrax outbreak, uninformed statements on local television in a community with two cases of meningococcal meningitis resulted in thousands of individu-als taking antibiotics or seeking immunizations that were not indicated. Local stores of antibiotics were depleted and many people were subjected to risk from unnecessary treatment. This episode emphasizes the need forcredible medical/public health information during natural events, as well as during those that are produced by terrorism. In the case of the anthrax episodes, the media responded by interviewing countless number of individuals. Among them was a self-professed pundit who announced he was an expert on the \"anthrax virus. \" Anthrax is a bacterium, not a virus. In many cases, well-intentioned infectious disease specialists who knew a good deal about the literature on anthrax could provide accurate retrospective information, but when pressed about thecurrent events, they were not privy to the information about the cases that had occurred. They were then forced to either acknowledge their limita- tions, which the responsible experts did, or in the case of others lessresponsible, to speculate based on news reports, rumors, and a variety of other kinds of incomplete or false information.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html318 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH In the case of anthrax, less than 20 cases resulted in thousands of people taking antibiotics that were not indicated. Perhaps 20 percent of these individuals experienced some side effects from these drugs. These antibi-otics changed the bacteriological environment and may have rendered some organisms resistant to the antibiotics employed. (Shine, 2001). In response to Department of Health and Human Services plans to reorganize communication, legislative, and public affairs offices, the Asso-ciation of Health Care Journalists and the National Association of ScienceWriters warned that tight control of information by top department man-agers may be efficient, but it can also increase the risk of communicationbottlenecks that can deprive the public of timely and vital health informa-tion, and raises questions about how the public 's access to objective infor- mation will be protected (AHCJ, 2002a). Analyzing the communication response to the anthrax attacks may present potentially critical lessons, and a rigorous review of the handling ofthe incident by the media and public health officials is needed to improvecommunication strategies for the future. The summary proceedings of arecent conference of media and public health representatives highlighted anumber of lessons learned from coverage of public health crises (Joseph,2002). First, the primary goal of both the press and public health profes-sionals is to serve the public, and the communication of accurate informa-tion is a crucial factor in this service. Second, a credible spokesperson orexpert must be available to the press to help ensure that information isaccurate. This is especially critical during a crisis when there is pressure forboth health and nonhealth reporters to cover an incident. Ideally, thespokesperson(s) should have an ongoing dialogue and relationship withreporters as well as editors. Third, public health professionals need toacknowledge the independence of the news media. The press attempts toprovide a balanced story for its audience and must be careful not to servejust as a \"vehicle \" for a specific group 's message. For the press, there is a fine line between cooperation and the risk of losing independence, orcooptation. Furthermore, the audience or public is not a single entity; it canbe segmented into different groups with different experiences, social deter-minants, cultures, and languages. Thus, it is essential to consider differentways of presenting information, especially when dealing with \"risks. \" Fourth, both public health officials and journalists share a concern that theU.S. public is unaccustomed to uncertainty and that public levels of literacyare low. The continuation of this dialogue is essential; there is much thatmedia and public health professionals can learn from each other that willhelp both improve their service to the public. Understanding and appreciating the perspectives and needs of all par- ties will create a better climate for accurately informing the public. The committee recommends that an ongoing dialogue be maintained betweenmedical and public health officials and editors and journalists at the localCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Furthermore, founda- tions and governmental health agencies should provide opportunities todevelop and evaluate educational and training programs that provide jour-nalists with experiences that will deepen their knowledge of public healthsubject matter and provide public health workers with a foundation incommunication theory, messaging, and application . Results from these ac- tivities would contribute knowledge on how best to structure training andother educational opportunities for health and media specialists so thatthey are better prepared to bring accurate health information to the public. MEDIA AND HEALTH COMMUNICATION Health communication campaigns are interventions intended to generate specific outcomes for a relatively large number of individuals within a speci-fied period of time and through an organized set of communication activities(Rogers and Storey, 1987). Large-scale health communication campaignsseeking to change behaviors were first seen in the United States in the eigh-teenth century in the form of efforts to educate the public about infectiousdiseases and the benefits of immunization. In 1721, Reverend Cotton Matherused pamphlets and personal appeals to promote immunization during asmallpox epidemic in Boston (Paisley, 2001). Another illustrative example ofa public health campaign was associated with the newly found knowledgethat the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacillus caused tuberculosis (TB) and that TB was communicable and could be prevented. In 1896, the New YorkCity Department of Health, responding to a report on TB developed by D.Hermann Biggs, issued an ordinance that prohibited spitting on sidewalks.The public and civil sectors helped to drive behavioral change at the indi-vidual level by placing notices in public areas warning that spitting on thefloor spread disease. Hospitals joined the effort by posting signs proclaiming\"spit is poison \" (Ruggiero, 2000). More recently, health communication campaigns have used a variety of ways to present health messages. This section discusses the use of specific media to promote health mes- sages. It first addresses public service announcements (PSAs) and then dis-cusses the role of emerging media channels \u2014the entertainment media and the Internet \u2014in conveying health messages. The section concludes with an examination of social marketing and media advocacy, strategies that usemedia as part of a broader approach to changing individual behavior orpromoting social change.

The requirement, however, does not specify the length of time or the time of daythat broadcasters should make PSAs available. In fact, PSAs are only oneoption for fulfilling the FCC requirement; broadcasters can meet their pub-lic interest obligations without running any PSAs at all. Furthermore, newbroadcasting venues such as cable networks have no statutory obligation toserve the public interest (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2002a). The Kaiser Family Foundation recently conducted a study to examine the amount of airtime that television broadcasters donate for PSAs. 2 They found that broadcast and cable television networks donate an average of 15seconds an hour to air PSAs. This represents just under one-half of 1percent (0.4 percent) of all airtime. Much of this donated airtime (43 per-cent) is made available between midnight and 6 a.m., and only 9 percent isavailable during prime time. The major broadcast networks (ABC, CBS,Fox, and NBC) donate an average of 5 seconds an hour to PSAs duringprime time. The study also found that health issues are the top priority ofPSAs at some networks: 52 percent of all donated airtime on MTV, 35percent of all donated airtime on Fox, and 33 percent on CBS are devotedto health issues (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2002a). In addition to donated airtime for PSAs, paid PSAs have become an- other mode to deliver public service messages. According to the KaiserFamily Foundation study, of all PSAs aired, 36 percent are paid for bysponsors (e.g., governmental agencies such as the Office of National DrugControl Policy and community-based organizations). Sponsors buy an av-erage of 9 seconds an hour of advertising time for paid PSAs per network.Paid PSAs are not only longer (on average, 9 seconds compared to 5 sec-onds for donated PSAs), but they are better placed. Only 18 percent of paidPSAs are run between midnight and 6 a.m., whereas 43 percent of donatedspots run between those hours. Health issues are also a primary focus ofpaid PSAs \u201439 percent convey health messages. The growing use of paid PSAs has raised concerns about the degree to 2 The study examined a week 's worth of television programming for 10 channels: the major broadcast networks ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC and the cable channels CNN, ESPN, MTV, Nickelodeon, TNT, and the Spanish-language network Univision.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlMEDIA 321 which networks are meeting their public service obligations. Paid PSAs are regarded by some as an indication that the traditional public service model \u2014 relying on donated airtime from broadcasters seeking to fulfill their publicservice obligations \u2014is no longer working (LaMay, 2002). Some paid PSA sponsors report that before turning to paying for PSAs, they encounteredsignificant difficulties getting messages on the air, especially during primetime (Berger, 2002). Struggles to get PSAs with health messages on the air can significantly challenge efforts to educate and persuade the public to adopt healthy prac-tices or to avoid behaviors that pose a risk to health. Reviews of the impactsof PSAs have found them to increase public recognition or awareness of aproblem and in some cases to motivate action or change behavior. Hu andcolleagues (1995), for example, found that California 's paid antismoking media campaign accounted for a 2 to 3 percent lower level of cigarettesales, or an estimated reduction of 232 million packs of cigarettes duringthe 2-year study period. The $1 million investment in media messagesreduced per capita cigarette sales by 7.7 packs. Part of the success of thiscampaign was that the paid nature of the PSAs allowed greater freedom intheir design, which was considered controversial and attracted news mediaattention (Dorfman and Wallack, 1993). Antismoking media campaigns inMassachusetts and Florida also report significant reductions in smokingbehavior. Siegel and Biener (2000) report that among a panel of Massachu-setts adolescents (aged 12 to 13 years at the baseline), those who wereexposed to television antismoking advertisements were significantly lesslikely to progress to established smoking 4 years later (odds ratio = 0.49; 95percent confidence interval = 0.26, 0.93). Similarly, Zucker and colleagues(2001) report a 19 percent decline in smoking among Florida middle schoolstudents and an 8 percent decline among Florida high school studentsexposed to antismoking media campaigns. The outcomes noted above are well documented. Atkin (2001) notes, however, that \"effects may unfold indirectly and gradually as messages increase knowledge, stimulate information seeking, and interpersonal dis-cussion and move individuals through early stages of decision making. \" In addition to specific behavioral change, Balbach and Glantz (1998) emphasize that public service advertising can also have an effect on publicdiscourse and can create pressure for changes in policy and regulations: The media, both paid advertising and free media, are important vehicles for putting pressure on public agencies. By running their own advertise-ments, program advocates can create a forum in which they are able to frame issues publicly in a way that reflects their viewpoint. This is a particularly powerful strategy if other forums, such as legislatures or over-sight bodies, have not been responsive. Such advertisements reach deci-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

(Balbach and Glantz, 1998: 407) The results noted are compelling; however, researchers and health com- municators increasingly understand that PSAs play a significant but limitedrole in promoting health messages and should be considered part of abroader health communication strategy. A question often debated when discussing PSAs is: Why should broad- casters be motivated to donate public service announcements, especially ifthere are monetary implications for them? There are at least three responsesto the question; first, the FCC, through its licensing agreements, imposes onbroadcasters a commitment to serve the public interest. Second, whenbroadcasters do so, it creates good will among their audiences, and asevidenced earlier, studies demonstrate that PSAs contribute to improvingthe health of the public who consume the broadcasters ' media. Third, when broadcasters comply freely, calls for tighter and more specific regulatoryactions to ensure broadcasters ' commitment to the public interest are less likely to be made. As noted earlier, not all broadcasters are averse to donating time for PSAs, and some have made significant contributions of time and effort topromote the health of the public. Viacom, a global media company withleading positions in broadcast and cable television, radio, outdoor advertis-ing, and online, recently announced (October 2002) that it has partneredwith the Kaiser Family Foundation to create an unprecedented, public in-formation campaign to eradicate ignorance about HIV/AIDS. The cam-paign capitalizes on Viacom 's global brand power and strong audience relationships to reach the public at large and those most affected by thedisease. The Kaiser Family Foundation brings to the partnership its exper-tise in HIV/AIDS and public education. The campaign includes domesticand international public messaging, television and radio programming, andoutdoor, print, and online content and employee education. The $120million campaign will be launched in January 2003 (www.viacom.com;www.kff.org). This partnership demonstrates strong corporate responsibil-ity and the role that the public health sector can play to engage mediagatekeepers in the task of promoting the public 's health. In light of the important opportunity that PSAs provide as a vehicle for the dissemination of messages to educate and persuade the public to adopthealthy practices or avoid behaviors that pose a risk to health and of thelimited amount of time donated to PSAs throughout the broadcasting sched-ule, the committee recommends that television networks, television sta- tions, and cable providers increase the amount of time they donate to PSAsas a partial fulfillment of the public service requirement in their FCC licens-ing agreements. In doing so, the public would benefit from more opportuni-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Historically, as mentioned above, the FCC has required that broadcast networks allot a certain amount of time to \"the public interest. \" Networks complied but often aired PSAs late at night, when few viewers were watch-ing. This was, of course, the least valuable time that the networks had, andbecause the networks competed with one another, using late night televi-sion for nonpaid advertisements was sensible. A critical opportunity, how-ever, was missed as corporations advertised their products, and the publicinterest was not served. The FCC should review the regulations governingbroadcast and broadband media with an eye toward finding ways in whichmedia institutions can serve the public 's interest in accurate health informa- tion without being unfairly burdened in the process. Better placement of PSAs would benefit the public as well as the media, which will be seen as fully contributing to the public good. The committee recommends that the FCC review its regulations for PSA broadcasting ontelevision and radio to ensure a more balanced broadcasting schedule thatwill reach a greater proportion of the viewing and listening audiences. This will benefit the public as well as the media 's image as a vital contributor to the public good. Policy makers may ask if PSAs are more effective in reducing cigarette consumption than other measures, such as tobacco taxation. Hu and col-leagues (1995) examined the relative effects of taxation versus an antismok-ing media campaign in California, as noted earlier. The study results indi-cate that both taxation and antismoking media campaigns are effectivemeans of reducing cigarette consumption. The authors note, however, thatthe strength of the effects is related to the magnitude of the taxes and theamount of resources expended on the media campaign. Corporations spend billions of dollars on paid advertising to promote their products. In 2001 (Ad Age, 2001), the 100 leading national advertis-ers spent well over $40 billion on advertising. The federal government isamong these advertisers, with just over $1 billion spent on advertising-related activities. Competition between state government spending on healthpromotion and prevention activities (which may include advertising) andcorporate marketing activities for products that undermine health is also intremendous imbalance. The public is negatively influenced by corporateadvertisers of unhealthy behaviors and products, with little counteradver-tising that promotes positive health behaviors. For example, in 2000, statespending on tobacco use prevention was $768.4 million, whereas tobaccocompanies spent $9.7 billion on marketing across the states (National Cen-ter for Tobacco Free Kids, 2002). To deal with such an imbalance inCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html324 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH advertising, researchers have proposed that a federal tax be levied on to- bacco advertising and promotion (Bayer et al., 2002). The impact of a 10-cent tax would generate about $2.1 billion a year, which would substan-tially increase the funds currently available for antitobacco advertising. TheU.S. Supreme Court has not yet tested the constitutionality of a content-based tax on commercial speech. More discussion and research are neededto identify and develop support for strategies that can improve the balancebetween advertising that promotes health and advertising for products thatharm the health of the public. Entertainment Media: Television Television is one of society 's most common and constant learning envi- ronments. Television entertainment programs and commercials, with po-tential positive and negative health messages embedded in them, reach tensof millions of viewers each day. Often, these messages reach viewers whomay not otherwise expose themselves to such information and do not fullyrealize that these messages may influence their thoughts and actions(Signorielli, 1990). However, concerted efforts to develop strong partner-ships between the entertainment media and health communicators are in-creasingly contributing to more accurate and timely health information inentertainment programming. American television producers have a history of working with health promotion experts to address public health issues. A few examples arealcoholism on Hill Street Blues and Cagney and Lacey ; AIDS on St. Else- where , Designing Women , and LA Law ; birth control on Valerie (Wallack, 1990); and the Jeanie Boulet storyline on AIDS on ER. A more concerted effort to partner with entertainment media to dis- seminate health messages was undertaken by researchers at the HarvardSchool of Public Health Center for Health Communication. In 1988, theHarvard Alcohol Project partnered with the three largest television net-works \u2014ABC, CBS, and NBC \u2014to demonstrate that a new social concept, the \"designated driver \" for avoiding driving after drinking, could be dif- fused rapidly through American society via mass communication techniques.As part of the project, television writers agreed to insert drunk drivingprevention messages and references to designated drivers into the scripts oftop-rated television programs. The networks also aired frequent PSAs dur-ing prime time that encouraged the use of designated drivers (www.hsph.harvard.edu/chc/alcohol). Evaluations of the campaign 's impact docu- mented a rapid, widespread acceptance and the strong popularity of thedesignated driver concept. Before the campaign, 62 percent of Gallup pollrespondents said that they and their families used a designated driver all ormost of the time. By mid-1989, the percentage had risen to 72 percent, aCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlMEDIA 325 statistically significant increase in the numbers of individuals using desig- nated drivers. Surveys sponsored by the National Highway Traffic SafetyAdministration in 1993 and 1995 found that about three-quarters of thosesurveyed responded that people should not be allowed to drive if they havebeen drinking any alcohol at all. These results indicate a wide acceptance ofthe social norm that the driver should not drink (Winsten and DeJong,2001). The designated driver concept and the strategy to emphasize it, how- ever, were extremely controversial. Some alcohol control advocates arguedthat they may have done more harm than good by encouraging excessivedrinking by passengers and deflecting attention away from the social deter-minants that influence alcohol consumption (DeJong and Wallack, 1992). In a more recent partnership, researchers at the Kaiser Family Founda- tion, together with a writer and producer of ER, NBC 's medical drama, collaborated to test the effect of health information communicated throughan ongoing television drama. They learned that a short mention of animportant health issue in an entertainment television show can make mil-lions of Americans aware of that issue. The experiment included preshow,postshow, and follow-up surveys of ER viewers. The surveys assessed view- ers' knowledge gain, their retention of health information, and their interest in health-related stories and actions taken based on the storylines. Study results indicate that viewer knowledge increased as a result of the ER episodes. For example, after an episode with a 1-minute story line on emergency contraception, the percentage of viewers who were aware ofemergency contraception increased from 50 to 67 percent, and 20 percentof viewers noted that they had learned about the issue from ER. This effect, however, decreased to baseline levels 2 months later. Similar knowledgegains occurred after a short vignette focused on a sexually transmitteddisease (STD) caused by human papilloma virus (HPV). HPV is the mostcommon cause of STDs in the country, and it has been linked to more than95 percent of all cases of cervical cancer. The proportion of ER viewers who had heard of HPV increased from 24 to 47 percent, and 32 percentwho had heard of HPV noted that they had learned about it from ER. One month later this effect had decreased but remained above preshow levels;38 percent of those surveyed reported having heard of HPV, and 16 percentcould give a correct description of HPV. Furthermore, the study found thatslightly more than half (51 percent) of the regular viewers surveyed wereprompted to discuss health issues presented on the show with friends andfamily, and one in five viewers reported turning to other sources for moreinformation about a health issue presented on ER (Brodie et al., 2001). Among their conclusions, the researchers noted that although enter- tainment television is a powerful medium for reaching a diverse and largeaudience on a regular basis, fictional depiction for the sake of dramaticCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

This observation confirms the need for apresent and competent public health partner to ensure that health informa-tion is accurate or to counteract misleading storylines. As noted above, the increase in knowledge of emergency contraception and HPV decreased over time. This suggests that media initiatives thatintroduce health messages into entertainment programming should be con-ceived as ongoing projects because the effects may be short-lived. Theexample described in the next section shows how ER storylines are lever- aged to continue health information dissemination and discussion at thelocal level. Following ER: The Audience Is Still Watching Another unique effort to disseminate health messages using television leveraged health-related storylines on ER and linked them to health seg- ments that were broadcast on local news stations after ER. The Following ER health news series initiative aimed to educate and motivate viewers to take action on health issues. The series was sponsored by the Kaiser FamilyFoundation and implemented by the Johns Hopkins Health Institutions.News staff from NBC affiliate WBAL in Baltimore provided the news re-porting. News segments included a 90-second news broadcast that in-structed viewers on how to prevent the type of disease or injury depicted inER's weekly episode. The segments also provided viewers with information about the resources of national organizations or health experts in the formof toll-free numbers or Internet addresses. Following ER ran for 4 years and reached an average weekly viewership of 1.7 million. The use of entertainment media as a strategy for providing health information is well founded. In 1999, the case for presenting health infor-mation through entertainment was strengthened by a CDC study of theHealthstyles Survey Database. Healthstyles is a proprietary database devel-oped by Porter Novelli, a social marketing and public relations firm. Thedatabase contains responses to the Healthstyles survey. The sample for thesurvey is drawn from the DDB Needham Lifestyles Survey, which bases itssampling on seven characteristics of the Bureau of the Census, consideredby most market research experts to create a sample that best represents theU.S. population (CDC, 2000). Results of the CDC analysis indicate that viewers of soap operas report that television is a major source of health information. Viewers report thatthey learn about health topics from soap operas and take positive action asa result. Women and African Americans, who are among the groups withthe largest representation among regular soap opera viewers, report thehighest rates of learning and action as a result of soap opera viewing (seeCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlMEDIA 327 Box 7 -2). Many people report that the information that they receive in the media has an important influence, often indirectly or directly affecting theirbehavior. Public health officials, however, are typically trained primarily inthe sciences and not in using media channels to promote health or conveyhealth information. This disconnect can give rise to confusion and less thanoptimal utilization of the media to promote public health goals. Conse-quently, the committee recommends that public health officials and local and national entertainment media work together to facilitate the communi-cation of accurate information about disease and about medical and healthissues in the entertainment media. Recognizing the powerful impact of the entertainment media in con- veying health information and messages, a number of health agencies andother groups are working to acknowledge the efforts of the Hollywoodcommunity. CDC, for example, established the Sentinel for Health AwardBOX 7 -2 Selected Findings from the 1999 Healthstyles Survey Regular viewers report that they learned something about a disease or how to prevent it from the following television entertainment shows in the past year: Soap operas (48 percent) Prime-time television shows (41 percent) Television talk shows (38 percent) More than one-third (34 percent) of regular viewers took one or more actions after hearing something about a health issue or disease on a soap opera in thepast year: Told someone about it (25 percent) Told someone to do something to prevent the health problem (13 percent) Visited a clinic or a doctor (7 percent) Did something to prevent the problem (6 percent) Regular viewers seek out and attend to health information more than nonview- ers.

CDC also funds the Hollywood, Health, andSociety program at the University of Southern California AnnenbergNorman Lear Center (University of Southern California, 2002). The pro-gram seeks to combine public health expertise with entertainment industryknowledge and outreach. Similarly, The Media Project, operated jointly bythe Kaiser Family Foundation and Advocates for Youth, has worked foryears to promote accurate descriptions of reproductive health issues intelevision shows and also administers an awards program. The SHINEAwards (Sexual Health IN Entertainment) honor those in the entertainmentindustry who do an exemplary job of incorporating accurate and honestportrayals of sexuality into their television, film, and music video program-ming (The Media Project, 2002). The Entertainment Industries Council,Inc., in partnership with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and theNational Institute on Drug Abuse of the National Institutes of Health,sponsors the PRISM Awards (www.eiconline.org). These awards honor the correct depiction of drug, alcohol, and tobacco use in television and featurefilms, music, and comic books. The committee applauds efforts to recog-nize and highlight the contributions of the entertainment media in convey-ing accurate health information and messages as part of their programmingactivities. Strong partnerships between the health community and the entertain- ment media are also important because they provide not only an opportu-nity to promote positive health messages but also an opportunity to educatethe entertainment media about the impact of negative health messages onviewers, especially children. According to a 1998 Nielsen report on televi-sion viewing, the average child or adolescent watches an average of nearly3 hours of television per day. Coupled with children 's general vulnerability, this makes them especially susceptible to the messages conveyed throughtelevision. A growing body of evidence associating the portrayal of violence in the entertainment media with increased aggression in young people, for example,has led a number of governmental and nongovernmental bodies to expressconcern regarding the amount of violence in the entertainment media. Thosevoicing concerns include the U.S. Surgeon General (1972), the National Insti-tute of Mental Health (1982), the American Psychological Association (1993),and the American Academy of Pediatrics (2001). Concerns have also beenexpressed about the entertainment media 's depictions of cigarettes, alcohol, and illicit drug use, sexual behavior, and body concepts because of theirpotentially negative impacts on children (Roberts, 2000). Given the important influence of the entertainment media on children and adults, the committee joins the voices of concern raised by other gov-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The Internet The Internet is rapidly and radically transforming many aspects of society, including reshaping how information is accessed and shared (NRC,2000). In the health arena, interactive health communication, or the inter-action of an individual \u2014consumer, patient, caregiver, or professional \u2014 with an electronic device or communication technology to access or trans-mit health information or receive guidance and support on a health-relatedissue, is growing at a rapid pace (Robinson et al., 1998). Consumer healthin particular is one area that is being reshaped by interactive health commu-nication. Consumer health refers to a set of activities aimed at empoweringconsumers in their own health and health care. Activities in this area in-clude the provision of health information, the development of tools for self-assessment of health risks and management of chronic diseases, and home-based monitoring of health status and delivery of care (NRC, 2000). A recent study of interactive health communication applications con- ducted by the Science Panel on Interactive Communication and Health,convened by the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion of theDepartment of Health and Human Services, examined the current status ofinteractive health communication and its potential to promote health. In itsconsensus statement, the panel identified 12 potential advantages of usingthe Internet for health communication (Robinson et al., 1998). These po-tential advantages are listed in Box 7 -3. The panel also identified six specific functions of interactive health communication, which are listed in Box 7 -4. These functions of interactive health communication have been noted by consumers as well as public- andprivate-sector organizations. According to a recent Harris Poll, an esti-mated 101 million U.S. web users have sought health care informationonline in the past year, up from 97 million in 2001 (Harris Poll, 2002). Webusers also turn to the Internet to find social support (Bly, 1999). Foote andEtheredge (2002), in a study conducted to identify strategies to improveconsumer health information services, found that insurers, provider organi-zations, consumer groups, foundations, and public-sector agencies are nowsponsoring initiatives to strengthen these services. They note as an examplethat some insurers and provider organizations offer consumer-focusedwebsites, preventive care and disease management outreach programs, andpeer support programs for patients and caregivers. Some of the new peersupport programs include meetings in person or online, introducing pa-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Improved opportunity to find information tailored to the specific needs or char- acteristics of individuals or groups of users (Harris, 1995). 2. Improved capabilities of various media to be combined with text, audio, and visuals and of matching specific media to the particular purposes of the inter- vention or the learning styles of users (Harris, 1995). 3. Increased possibility for users to remain anonymous by providing access to sensitive information that people may be uncomfortable acquiring in a public forum or during a face-to-face discussion. Computer-based interfaces also canincrease a participant 's willingness to engage in frank discussions about health status, behavioral risks, fears, and uncertainties (Robinson, 1989; Locke et al., 1992; Gustafson et al., 1993; General Accounting Office, 1996). 4. Increased access to information and support on demand because these re- sources often can be used at any time and from numerous locations (Harris, 1995; General Accounting Office, 1996). 5. Increased opportunity for users to interact with health professionals or to find support from others similarly situated through the use of networking technolo- gies such as e-mail, which enables direct communication between individuals,despite distance or structural barriers (Robinson, 1989; Harris, 1995; General Accounting Office, 1996; Pingree et al., 1996). 6. Enhanced ability for widespread dissemination and for expanding an audience at a limited incremental cost once the necessary hardware infrastructure is in place (General Accounting Office, 1996; Eng et al., 1998).

This section briefly highlights three areas ofconcern: (1) the quality of information, (2) the digital divide, and (3) theprivacy and confidentiality of personal health information. A recent National Research Council (NRC) committee charged with studying the Internet and health applications noted the need for tools tohelp consumers find information of interest and evaluate its quality (NRC,2000). The sheer volume of health information on the Internet, the NRCcommittee noted, can be overwhelming. For example, a simple web searchfor \"diabetes mellitus \" returned more than 40,000 web pages, and some 61,000 websites contain information on breast cancer (Boodman, 1999).The committee emphasized that consumers need effective searching andfiltering tools that can help identify and rank information according to theirneeds and capabilities and present it in a form they can understand, regard-less of educational or cultural background. Consumers also need a way tojudge the quality, authoritativeness, and origin of the information. Becausethe Internet allows anyone to publish information, filtering andcredentialing become extremely important. The Scientific Panel on Interac-tive Health Communication, for example, has called for disclosure state-ments on websites to make it easier for consumers to evaluate the sourceand authority of information resources. Other efforts to help consumersevaluate health-related websites focus on systems for classifying informa-tion according to characteristics such as accuracy, timeliness, completeness,and clarity (NRC, 2000). Mitretek Systems ' Information Quality Tool, a tool that helps educate consumers by evaluating a website 's strengths and weaknesses, is an example of such an effort (Mitretek Systems, 2002). The digital divide is another area of concern that must be addressed if disparities in access to interactive health communication are to be over-come. The digital divide refers to the experiences of two groups of people:one group has access to information technology and relevant training to usethat technology; the other group, for a variety of reasons, does not haveaccess to such technology and is not trained to use it. The difference be-tween these two groups of people is what has been called the \"digital divide \" (NTIA, 2002). A recent Pew Internet Project study reported that the digital divide is narrowing. Internet use is becoming more available towomen and minorities. The African-American population online grew 8percent during the first half of 2000. A large portion of the increase camefrom African-American women: 45 percent of African-American womenhad Internet access in November and December, whereas 34 percent hadInternet access at midyear (May to June). Access to the Internet also in-creased for African-American men and access by the Hispanic populationincreased by 7 percentage points (Fox, 2001).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html332 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH Even if access to information services were to improve for all groups, disparities could continue to exist because many individuals have low levelsof literacy or problems with the English language. Developers of web-basedinformation sites and interactive health applications need to consider thatapproximately one of five Americans is functionally illiterate and unable tocomprehend written materials. One study (Berland et al., 2001) found thatthe average reading level of English-language websites was collegiate andranged from 10th grade to graduate school level. Similarly, website devel-opers and those using the Internet to provide health information and appli-cations should consider the growing diversity of the U.S. population andglobalization. In response to this problem, federal efforts are under way todevelop agency-related non-English-language websites that are accessible toall persons who, as a result of national origin, are not proficient in Englishor are limited in their ability to communicate in the English language (WhiteHouse, 2000). Illustrative of the response to the Executive Order is theDepartment of Health and Human Services ' Spanish-language Healthfinder, a guide to health information, and the Food and Drug Administration 's efforts to provide food and cosmetic information in 17 languages. Protection of the privacy and confidentiality of personal health infor- mation is a challenge for Internet health communication activities. Accord-ing to consumer surveys, individuals feel very strongly about keeping theirhealth concerns private. They must have confidence that information that iscollected, stored, and made available online is protected. If the informationis shared, it should be shared only with a health professional with thecapacity and commitment to maintain complete confidentiality (Patrick etal., 1999). Policy making at the federal and other levels is under way todevelop steps that will ensure the secure, private, and confidential transmis-sion of information. This section has focused primarily on the Internet as a medium for personal health care information. The Internet also provides access to anumber of data resources that focus on population health. CDC WONDERserves as a single point of access to a variety of CDC public health informa-tion that can be valuable in public health research, decision making, prior-ity setting, program evaluation, and resource allocation and for informingthe public at large (http://wonder.cdc.gov). Similarly, the Department ofHealth and Human Services, in collaboration with the Association of Stateand Territorial Health Officials, National Association of County and CityHealth Officials, and the Public Health Foundation, manages a website thatprovides access to community health status indicators (NACCHO, 2002).The Community Health Status Indicators Project was developed in re-sponse to community-based requests for data to assess health, plan pro-grams, and develop data-based health policy. Individuals and communityCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

More recently, the Internet has become an important tool for providing real-time access to critical information. CDC, for example, webcasts criticalbriefings on bioterrorism through the site www.bt.cdc.gov. In late Septem-ber 2002, the site provided a full copy of the revised Smallpox Response Plan and Guidelines (CDC, 2002a), an online telebriefing that discusses the plan and that provides a transcript of the briefing and a press release.Another Internet-based initiative is the University of North Carolina Schoolof Public Health 's Public Health Grand Rounds, sponsored by CDC (Uni- versity of North Carolina, 2002) . Grand Rounds covers a variety of publichealth topics including bioterrorism preparedness. Webcasts are availablefor simultaneous downlink to a personal computer anywhere in the world.Part of the show allows viewers to call in or e-mail questions. Moreover,webcasts are followed up for 3 weeks with a postshow web forum so thatviewers can continue to ask questions and receive answers, share best prac-tices, and network with other participants. These activities can be con-ducted individually or in groups. Strategies That Use Media Tools to Promote Population Health Thus far, this chapter has discussed the use of specific media channels to promote health and has shown how certain media programs have influ-enced health-related behaviors. Given the prominence of media communi-cation in people 's lives, some scholars have argued that the public 's health is best served by focusing public health resources on media strategies. Thesestrategies place at the center of their activities the use of media communica-tion to shape public opinion and promote health. By using media communi-cation, the health of the public can be promoted in cost-effective andsustainable ways. Two of the most prominent of these strategies are socialmarketing and media advocacy. Social Marketing Social marketing is an approach that attempts to apply advertising and marketing principles to \"sell\" positive health behaviors (Kotler and Zaltman, 1971; Kotler and Roberto, 1989; Kotler et al., 2002). Socialmarketing combines marketing concepts with social influence theories tomotivate individuals to change their behavior. Drawing from variables usedto plan traditional marketing strategies, social marketing has reinterpretedthem for use in planning how to \"sell\" health objectives (Wallack, 1990). In commercial business, marketing is about getting the right productCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html334 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH (what you sell), at the right price (what the consumer pays), in the right place (where it is sold), at the right time, and in such a way as to success-fully satisfy the needs of the consumer (what you do to attract the buyer)(Cannon, 1986; Hastings and Haywood, 1991; NCI, 2002). Marketingtechniques use the consumer or target audience as the central focus to planand conduct a marketing program. In social marketing for improved healthoutcomes, these marketing variables (the \"four P 's\") take on the following definitions: \" Product \" might be defined as the behavior that the program is trying to change within the target audience; more specifically, it could besafer sex or nonsmoking. \" Price \" represents what the consumer must give up to accept the health promoter 's offering. Price might include the monetary, time, psycho- logical, or physical costs to the consumer. \" Place \" concerns the distribution channels used to reach the con- sumer; these could be the mass media, the community, or interpersonalchannels of communication. \" Promotion \" is the means (e.g., media outreach and testimonials) by which the health promoter communicates the product to the consumer(Leathar et al., 1986; NCI, 2002) and the benefits of adopting this newproduct (e.g., practicing safe sex or not smoking). These variables in an AIDS initiative, for example, could translate into condoms as the product, a free price, health centers, clinics, or schools asthe place, and advertising and personal selling for promotion (Leathar etal., 1986). Key to the social marketing approach is rigorous up-front planning and research, with engineering-style decision making found in traditional mar-keting processes. At a minimum, the problem and objectives must be clearlydefined and stated, the consumer must be heard, and the product must beresponsive to consumer needs (Walsh et al., 1993). Formative research is an important tool used throughout the social marketing process to ensure that consumers are heard and that the productis responsive to their needs. Formative research, for example, can provideconsumer input early in the design of a program to better define the natureof the problem to be tackled and to specify the goals. It can also be used toconduct an analysis of the audience for segmentation \u2014the process of parti- tioning a heterogeneous population into groups or segments of people withsimilar needs, experiences, or other characteristics. Formative research canalso be used to measure the media-viewing habits of the target populationso that messages can be placed in the right media, to assess preexistingknowledge and attitudes for specific segments of the population, and to testCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Lastly, formative research can provide feedback throughout the entire process through surveys, inter-views, and focus groups that lead to improvements in the marketing ofpositive health behaviors or objectives. Evaluation is a critical componentof social marketing that assesses whether the product was successfully mar-keted to the target audience at the right price and place and through themost effective promotion strategies to result in improved health outcomes.As a result, formative research allows the consumer to guide the entiresocial marketing process (Leathar et al., 1986; Wallack, 1990; Walsh et al.,1993). In addition to the four P 's described above, social marketing adds three more \"P's\" to influence health behaviors that benefit the target audience and the public at large. These include partnership, policy, and politics: \" Partnership \" involves the identification and interaction of mul- tiple organizations and agencies that share similar goals and that can worktogether to reach the target audience more effectively. Promoting and sus-taining healthy behaviors, such as physical activity among children, re-quires the participation of all interested parties, including health care pro-viders and clinics, schools, communities, faith-based organizations, andothers. \" Policy \" recognizes the need for social and environmental changes to support individual behavioral change. Without supportive policies, so-cial marketing campaigns cannot be sustained. Making convenience storesaccountable to the laws regarding the selling of cigarettes to minors is anexample of how policy supports a campaign to decrease underage smokingin a particular community. \" Politics \" involves the recognition and strategies incorporated to gain political support for a campaign or ensure political diplomacy withinthe targeted community and across interested parties. Social marketingprograms often target complex and controversial issues, such as gun safetyinitiatives, that require understanding, involvement, and support from out-side organizations or parties who may limit or hinder the program 's reach if they are not identified and approached early (Weinreich, 1999). When a social marketing campaign is being developed, the planning process follows the same steps identified above for general health commu-nication strategies. The needs and perceptions of the consumer remain theprimary focus in developing a campaign or program. The process startswith (1) planning and strategy selection, followed by (2) the selection ofchannels and materials, (3) the development of materials and pretesting, (4)implementation, (5) assessment of effectiveness, and (6) feedback to refinethe program. The process is circular, with the last stage feeding back intoCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

One example of a social marketing approach is the ABC Immunization Calendar program developed by the Health Communication Research Labo-ratory at St. Louis University in Missouri. In response to the fact that lessthan half of children ages 2 and younger are fully immunized in most majorU.S. cities, the ABC Immunization Calendar program was developed toraise immunization rates among children from families in lower socioeco-nomic groups \u2014the targeted audience (Zell et al., 1994). Based on evidence that more patient-oriented approaches by providers have been recom-mended and that computer-generated educational materials that are tai-lored to individuals are more likely to be read, remembered, saved, anddiscussed and to lead to changes in behavior, especially among poor andunderserved populations, the program provides computer-made immuniza-tion promotion calendars tailored to each child (National Vaccine AdvisoryCommittee, 1992; Skinner et al., 1994; Brug et al., 1996; Bull et al., 1999).The calendar includes the child 's name, picture, height, and weight as well as room to track his or her growth, family birth dates, helpful hints, inter-esting facts about the child 's living environment (e.g., use of car seats, limiting exposure to smokers, and the presence of smoke detectors in thehouse), the most recent and next immunization appointment, and appoint-ments for future well-baby checkups. The calendars were developed on the basis of interviews and focus group meetings with mothers of young children from communities of lowersocioeconomic status who strongly supported the inclusion of a color photoof their child on the calendar. Because many families could not afford tohave professional pictures taken of their child, the calendar fulfilled thisneed and was seen as a valuable and prized addition to the home. Thecalendars were printed on brightly colored paper and laminated for dura-bility. Mothers would receive calendars for each of the months leading upto their children 's next immunization appointment. When the child was vaccinated, new calendars were generated for the next appointment. As aresult, the calendars provided an incentive for the family to keep appoint-ments, come to the clinic, and have the child immunized. To monitor the program 's effectiveness, mothers who were given calen- dars, as well as the providers at participating health clinics, were askedabout the perceived value and utility of the calendars, enrollment in theprogram, adherence to the immunization schedule in terms of keeping ap-pointments, and overall immunization behavior. In the clinics and commu-nities where the ABC Immunization Calendar program has been imple-mented, great strides have been made in increasing the number ofimmunized children. Multiple strategies at the state, clinic, and family orCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Coupled withthese two components, the ABC Immunization Calendar program uses thefocus and strategies of social marketing to more effectively engage parentsand ensure higher rates of childhood immunization among low-income andunderserved families. The national Turning Point Initiative 3 understood the potential impact that social marketing initiatives can have on improving population healthand formed a collaborative of partners to review and widely disseminatesocial marketing information to improve community health. A resourceguide on social marketing is available from the Turning Point (2002)website. A clear tension exists between social marketing and corporate market- ing, especially when corporate advertising messages result in audience con-fusion. Corporation-sponsored ads that are health promoting can under-mine public health media campaigns. Farrelly and colleagues (2002) foundthat corporation-sponsored \"don't smoke \" campaigns that target youth were associated with an increase in the intention to smoke in the next year.Landman and colleagues (2002) also concluded that tobacco industry pro-grams that target youth do more harm than good for tobacco control. InFlorida, tobacco program evaluators noted that Philip Morris ads confusedyouth viewers and interfered with the state-sponsored antismoking cam-paign. Since its commercials, which are preachy and poorly done, run in the same demographic buy as the \"truth \" commercials, which have already been established as irreverent and effective, Philip Morris ' efforts have proven problematic. Many teens assume the Philip Morris ads are \"truth \" ads and have asked why the campaign has \"gone lame. \" (Florida Depart- ment of Health, 1999) As a result of such findings, antismoking associations such as the America Legacy Foundation (www.americanlegacy.org) have called for theremoval of tobacco industry-supported \"don't smoke \" campaigns. 3 The national Turning Point Initiative is sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Founda- tion and the Kellogg Foundation. Turning Point has established 21 state and 41 community- level partnerships to improve and strengthen the public health system.

All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html338 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH Media Advocacy As discussed in Chapter 2, an increasing science base links social deter- minants to the health status of populations. Health behavior, in particular,has been shown to be linked to the larger social, political, and economicenvironments (Smedley and Syme, 2000). Media advocacy is a developingstrategy that seeks to change social determinants of health, primarily publicpolicy, rather than personal habits or behaviors. Specifically, media advo-cacy is defined as the strategic use of mass media and its tools, in combina-tion with community organizing, to advance healthy public policies. Theprimary focus is on the role of the news media, with secondary attention tothe use of paid advertising (DHHS, 1989; advocacy seeks tocreate a loud voice for social change and shape the message so that itresonates with social justice values that are the presumed basis of publichealth (Beauchamp, 1976; Mann, 1977). A wide range of grassroots com-munity groups, public health leadership groups, public health and socialadvocates, and public health researchers have used media tools to effectsocial change that would influence health (Wallack et al., 1993, 1999;Woodruff, 1996). Media advocacy differs in many ways from traditional public health campaigns. In particular, it emphasizes the following: 4 Linking public health and social problems to inequities in social arrangements rather than to flaws in the individual; Changing public policy rather than personal health behavior; Focusing primarily on reaching opinion leaders and policy makers rather than on those who have the problem (the traditional audience ofpublic health communication campaigns); Working with groups to increase participation and amplify their voices rather than providing health behavior change messages; and Having a primary goal of reducing the power gap rather than just filling the information gap. Media advocacy is generally seen as a part of a broader strategy rather than as a strategy per se and focuses on four primary activities in support ofcommunity organizing, policy development, and advancing policy: 4 This section was previously published in Speaking About Health: Assessing Health Com- munication Strategies for Diverse Populations (IOM, 2002) .Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlMEDIA 339 1.Developing an overall strategy : Media advocacy relies on critical thinking to understand and respond to problems as social issues rather thanpersonal problems. Following problem definition, the focus is on elaborat-ing policy options; identifying the person, group, or organization that hasthe power to create the necessary change; and identifying organizations thatcan apply pressure to advance the policy and create change. Finally, variousmessages for the different targets of the campaign are developed. 2. Setting the agenda : Getting an issue in the media can help set the agenda and provide legitimacy and credibility to the issue and the group.Media advocacy involves understanding how journalism works to increaseaccess to the news media. This includes maintaining a media list, monitor-ing the news media, understanding the elements of newsworthiness, pitch-ing stories and holding news events, and developing editorial strategies forreaching key opinion leaders. 3.Shaping the debate : The news media generally focuses on the plight of the victim, whereas policy advocates emphasize the social conditions thatcreate victims. Health advocates frame policy issues using public healthvalues that resonate with broad audiences. Some of the steps include\"translat[ing] personal problems into public issues \" (Mills, 1959); empha- sizing social accountability as well as personal responsibility; identifyingindividuals and organizations that must assume a greater burden for ad-dressing the problem; presenting a clear and concise policy solution; andpackaging the story by combining key elements such as visuals, expertvoices, authentic voices (those with experience with the problem), mediabites, social math (creating a context for large numbers that is interesting tothe press and understandable to the public), research summaries, fact sheets,policy papers, and so forth. 4.Advancing the policy : Policy battles are often long and contentious, and it is important to develop strategies to maintain the media spotlight onthe policy issue on a continuing basis. This means identifying opportunitiesto reintroduce the issue to the media, such as on key anniversaries ofrelevant dates, upon publication of new reports, by providing notice ofsignificant meetings or hearings, and by linking the policy solution to break-ing news (Wallack, 2000; Dorfman and Woodruff, 2002). To demonstrate when media advocacy is an appropriate strategy, Wallack and Dorfman (2000) provide the example given in Box 7 -5. This example emphasizes that economic conditions had to change before indi-vidual behaviors could be expected to change. The Coalition on Alcohol Outlet Issues (CAOI) in Oakland, California, is one group that has used media tools to secure passage and implementa-tion of legislation designed to reduce crime around liquor stores (Seevak,1997). Formed in 1993, the citywide coalition included a broad range ofCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

This ordinance would require liquor storesto pay an annual fee of $600 to cover the cost of an education, monitoring,and enforcement program to reduce problems associated with alcohol out-lets such as violence, drug dealing, gambling, prostitution, vandalism, andother public health and safety problems. Ultimately, this ordinance wouldgive the city authority to revoke the business permits of noncompliantliquor stores. CAOI 's membership included all racial and ethnic groups and mirrored the population mix of the city, especially the \"flatland \" areas with the lowest median household income; the largest number of public housingprojects; the fewest grocery stores, community centers, and job opportuni-ties; and three to five times as many liquor stores as the wealthier parts ofthe city. From the beginning, CAOI committed itself to keeping its membersengaged in a well-organized and clear strategy to secure passage of theordinance. The strategy also called for reaching out to the community andbuilding support among members who would actively participate in CAOI 's initiatives. The coalition used media tools to educate community membersabout the ordinance, demonstrate unity of opinion to policy makers, andBOX 7 -5 Wallack and Dorfman 's Example 5-a-Day campaigns have as their goal improving health status by increasing consumption of fruit and vegetables. This worthy goal will remain unattainable,despite the most persuasive communications campaign, if fruit and vegetables are not easily available and affordable. One local group in California wanted to initiate a local 5-a-Day campaign to improve the outcomes of teen pregnancies. Whenthey sought our advice on administering a 5-a-Day campaign, we asked, \"Where will the young women get the fruit and vegetables? \" The major supermarkets have abandoned the inner-city neighborhoods that were home to the teens they wantedto reach, leaving nothing but corner liquor stores that stocked old and expensive fruit and vegetables, if they stocked them at all. We suggested they frame this from an economic development perspective and involve the teens in a campaign todemand the return of the grocers, to initiate a community garden, or other effort to create an environment in which they could make healthy choices for themselves and their families. In this example, a 5-a-Day social marketing campaign wouldmake sense only after a campaign had been carried out to ensure the local avail- ability of fruits and vegetables.

CAOI 's strategy included meeting with public officials, testifying at hearings, providing well-prepared spokespersons, and holding demon-strations and rallies to which the media was always invited. The coalition developed close relationships with journalists and other media outlets by providing newsworthy information, storylines, and testi-monials. CAOI also prepared media or press kits for all journalists and easyaccess to coalition contacts. As a result, dozens of print, television, andradio stories were generated that secured the attention of policy makers andhelped frame the issue as one of public safety and local control. CAOI incorporated media tools with each step of the political process, including drafting the ordinance, securing passage by the City Council, andimplementing the legislation. The coalition also helped fight off the legaland legislative tactics employed by the liquor industry, which sought toderail the ordinance by arguing that the city had overstepped its authorityand had no legal right to pass such requirements on alcohol outlets. In theend, the California Supreme Court upheld the ordinance and ensured thatcities and counties across California had tools to better regulate alcoholavailability. HEALTH COMMUNICATION CAMPAIGNS: THEORY, EVALUATION, AND RESEARCH NEEDS In the twentieth century, large-scale health communication campaigns focused on the promotion of hygiene behaviors, safety and accident preven-tion, substance abuse prevention, adoption of healthy lifestyles and eatinghabits, family planning and contraceptive use, and many other topics(Valente and Schuster, 2002). Through mass media campaigns, health pro-moters try to accelerate behavioral change by informing the public (increas-ing knowledge), changing attitudes, and directly encouraging individuals toadopt healthy behaviors. Theories Used to Understand Media Impact Behavioral change theory plays an important role in the promotion of health by use of communication strategies (Valente, 2002). Theory indi-cates the types of messages that will more likely be successful by specifyinghow behavioral change occurs. For example, if theory indicates that adoles-cents smoke because they incorrectly perceive smoking to be popular, thensuccessful programs will have to change these norms. In short, theory guidesprogram and message design. Theory is also used to estimate how muchimpact can be expected from a health communication program. EstimatesCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html342 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH of impact are important for determining the sample size needed to conduct an appropriate evaluation to assess whether the program worked. Finally,theory can help determine why and how a health promotion program didor did not work (Valente, 2002). A short synopsis of relevant behavioralchange and media impact theories follows. Social Influence, Social Comparison, and Convergence Theories Social influence, social comparison, and convergence theories proposed by social scientists specify that one 's perception and behavior are influenced by the perceptions and behaviors of the members of groups to which onebelongs. Peer group influences and social influences such as those presentedthrough television and radio can affect the process of change and eventualconversion of behavior (Johns Hopkins University, 2003). Health Belief Model The health belief model is one of the oldest models developed to under- stand health-related behavioral change (Becker, 1974). It reflects a con-scious decision-making process (Peterson and DiClemente, 2000). Themodel posits that two major factors influence the likelihood that a personwill adopt a recommended health-protective behavior. First, the personmust feel susceptible or threatened by the disease or condition, and a highlevel of severity must characterize the condition. Second, the person mustbelieve that the benefits of taking the recommended action outweigh theperceived barriers (or costs) to performing the preventive action (IOM,2002). The health belief model is believed to have been used more than anyother health-related behavioral change model over the past decade (Petersonand DiClemente, 2000). Diffusion of Innovation Theory The diffusion of innovation theory describes the process by which an innovation, new ideas, opinions, attitudes, and behaviors are communi-cated through certain channels over time and spread among the members ofa social system or community (Ryan and Gross, 1943; Katz et al., 1963;Rogers Rogers, 1995; Valente andRogers, 1995). Diffusion theory has been used to examine the spread ofnew computer technology, educational curricula, farming practices, familyplanning methods, medical technology, and many other innovations. Diffu-sion theory has five major assumptions: (1) adoption takes time; (2) peoplepass through various stages in the adoption process; (3) they can modify theinnovation and sometimes discontinue its use; (4) the perceived characteris-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlMEDIA 343 tics of the innovation influence its adoption; and (5) individual characteris- tics influence its adoption (Valente and Schuster, 2002). Rogers (1995)suggests that the mass media are quick, effective routes for introducing newinformation, especially in the early stages and with audiences that are pre-disposed to accepting new ideas. Input -Output Persuasion Model Formulated by William McGuire in 1969, the input -output persuasion model identifies five steps that are critical to how successful persuasionattempts will be in effecting change (see Box 7 -6). The theory also consid- ers how various aspects of communication such as the message design,source, and channel, as well as receiver characteristics, affect the behavioraloutcome of communication (McGuire, 1969, 1981). Theory of Reasoned Action Proposed by Fishbein and Azjen in 1975, the theory of reasoned action specifies that the adoption of a behavior is a function of a person 's intention to perform that behavior. The intention to perform a given behavior is, inturn, a function of a person 's attitude toward performing the behavior (belief that performing the behavior will lead to certain outcomes and the expectedvalue of the outcome) and of perceived social norms (belief that a specificindividual or groups thinks that one should or should not perform the behav-ior in question) and motivations to comply (the degree to which, in general,one wants to do what the referent thinks one should do) (IOM, 2002). Social Learning (Cognitive) Theory According to the social learning (cognitive) theory model, four compo- nents are critical if behavioral change is to occur. First, an informationBOX 7 -6 Critical Steps in Persuasion 1. Exposure and attention to the message 2. Comprehension of the message3. Yielding to the message (personalizing the behavior to fit one 's life and accept- ing the change) 4. Retaining the message5. Acting to make the change and accepting the behavior in one 's lifeCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html344 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH component is needed to increase awareness and knowledge and to convince people that they have the ability to change behavior. Second, a motivationalcomponent is needed to develop social and self-regulatory skills to practicethe new behavior. A third component enhances the development of socialand self-regulatory skills (through the promotion of self-efficacy), and afourth component develops or engages social supports for the individualmaking the change. Applied to communication through the mass media, themessage gives audiences an opportunity to identify with characters whodemonstrate (different or new) behaviors and allows them to engage theemotions and mentally rehearse and model the new behavior (Bandura,1977, 1986; Peterson and DiClemente, 2000; IOM, 2002). Theories of Emotional Response As described by Zajonc, emotional response is believed to precede and condition cognitive and attitudinal effects. For communication strategies,this means that highly emotional messages would be more readily acceptedby audience members and would more likely lead to behavioral changethan messages that are low in emotional content. Stages-of-Change Theory The stages-of-change theory posits that several psychological stages can be observed in individuals who are making a behavioral change (Prochaskaet al., 1992). Changes in behavior are believed to result when the psychemoves through several iterations of a spiral process. This process beginswith precontemplation (not really considering making the change); contin-ues with contemplation of making the change, preparation (intention tomake the change), and action (making the change); and finally, ends withmaintenance of the new behavior. Cultivation Theory of Mass Media George Gerbner proposed the cultivation theory of mass media in 1973. The theory proposes that repeated and intense exposure to definitions of\"reality \" in television and other mass media messages can lead to the percep- tion of that reality as normal. The social legitimization of the reality pre-sented can thus affect behavior (Gerbner, 1973, 1977; Gerbner et al., 1980). Agenda Setting The agenda-setting theory was made prominent by McCombs and Shaw (1972) and, more recently, by Dearing and Rogers (1996). The theoryCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlMEDIA 345 provides a framework for understanding how media influences the salience of an issue in the minds of audiences. The theory suggests that the perva-siveness of mass media and the passivity of audiences allow the media toshape opinions. Furthermore, the theory allows consideration of how me-dia attention to specific issues (e.g., violent crime) that is disproportionateto objective measures (e.g., statistics on violence) can influence what anaudience thinks. Framing Theory Drawing from the political and social sciences, framing theory suggests that the way in which information is framed can have a significant impacton the way that people process information and on their subsequent ac-tions. As explained by Kinder and Berinsky (1999), \"frames \" are verbal, visual, or image devices used to focus and define a topic or issue in aparticular way. In the context of health communication, framing theory is used to develop strategies that will result in individual behavioral change or changesin public policy. For example, framing genetically linked cancers as a familyissue as opposed to an individual issue could increase the impact of screen-ing not only for the individual but also for the individual 's blood relatives, allowing a \"family-centered approach \" to cancer screening (Sheila Murphy, Annenberg School of Communication, University of Southern California,personal communication, 2002). Similarly, different public policy optionsare required if violent actions are framed as isolated, random incidents or asa public health problem that takes into consideration population-basedviolence statistics in the context of other community indicators, such as theavailability of firearms and alcohol and the degree of unemployment. The theories reviewed here are the most common ones used in the health and medical fields (Glanz et al., 1997), and most of them acknowl-edge that the media can play some role in influencing human behavior.These theories can be used to understand how health information in themedia affects the public 's health, whether the information is received from deliberate media programming or from day-to-day behavior (IOM, 2002). Evaluation and Research Regardless of the media channels used to promote health, all health communication and promotion programs should be accompanied by evalu-ation and research activities designed to determine the impacts of the healthpromotion messages. This section provides a discussion of evaluation andresearch issues.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html346 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH Evaluation Evaluations of health communication and promotion programs should be systematic and participatory and should be designed to provide informa-tion that is useful for understanding whether the program worked, forwhom, and to what degree and to provide information useful for decidingthe appropriate next steps. Evaluation frameworks such as Green and Kreuter (1991) and Valente (2002) can be used to plan evaluation activities. These frameworks gener-ally call for needs assessment, formative research, monitoring, andsummative research. The evaluation can be both qualitative and quantita-tive, but most importantly, it should be tailored so that it is appropriate tothe intervention being evaluated. The tailoring requires that the evaluationbe integrated into the design and implementation of the health communica-tion activities. Media-led interventions pose certain challenges for evaluation. First, for example, media communication cannot usually be restricted in its dis-semination; thus, creating control groups can be challenging. Community-level evaluations have been conducted, but these often suffer from lowstatistical power. A second challenge is that media communication is oftendesigned for specific audiences (e.g., teens, African Americans, or Hispanics)and so often cannot be replicated for other audiences or settings. A thirdchallenge is to have the research and implementation teams integratedenough so that the evaluation team can respond to creative changes thatoccur in the intervention. McKenna and Williams (1993), for example,found that a CDC counteradvertising strategy based on subtle portrayal ofthe tobacco industry as manipulating teens to smoke did not communicatethe message clearly to young teens. About 38 percent of those who vieweda campaign television spot believed that the main message promoted smok-ing. In conclusion, CDC researchers learned that it is important to obtaininput from the target audience throughout the creative process and thatmore research is needed to better execute messages to target audiences. Naturally, many other challenges face evaluators as they try to deter- mine what works in the deliberate and not-so-deliberate communicationof health information to the public (Valente, 2002). Behavioral changetheory is useful for setting program goals and objectives, as these theoriesattempt to explain the motivations for human behavior. These objectivesare then used to determine the study sample sizes needed to demonstrateprogram effectiveness. Selecting an appropriate study design (experimen-tal versus quasiexperimental, community versus individual level) is a chal-lenge and is often dictated by the planned intervention. For example, aprogram that uses billboards to communicate its message is delivered atthe community level; thus, it is not possible to assign individuals randomlyto the intervention.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlMEDIA 347 The difficulty in health promotion program evaluation lies in the fact that every evaluation presents its own demands in terms of the trade-offbetween rigor and cost. Although randomized control trials are the \"gold standard \" for evaluating the impact of an intervention, they are rarely feasible for community- or population-based programs. Trade-offs betweenrigor and feasibility are inevitable and are best addressed by informedresearchers who can control relevant threats to validity. Thus, there is aneed not only to evaluate health promotion interventions but also to de-velop an evidence base for what works, among whom, and to what degree. Research Research on the effectiveness of media promotions for changing health- related behavior has been conducted for some time. The most commonlyresearched topics have been tobacco use, alcohol abuse, screening for can-cer and other diseases, seat belt use, and the promotion of contraceptivesand methods to prevent STDs. These studies have shown that the media canbe used to increase knowledge about appropriate behaviors, create morepositive attitudes toward the health behaviors, and lead to behavioralchange among audience members. This triad of outcomes, knowledge (K),attitudes (A), and practices (P), has provided a convenient shorthand forguiding research on the effectiveness of media-driven health promotions.The degree of evidence for KAP models of behavioral change, however, islimited (Valente et al., 1998). Further research is needed to determinewhether the KAP model is a useful one for understanding the impacts ofmedia communication and what other models can or should be developedto understand media-generated behavioral change. Regardless of the steps that precede behavioral change, media commu- nication has been found to influence behavioral change. In a series of meta-analyses, Snyder (2001) has discovered that media communication abouthealth have been shown to create about an 8-percentage-point change inbehavior. Media communication creates more change when it promotes theadoption of new behavior (condom promotion) than when it attempts toget people to quit addictive behaviors (tobacco use). Research by Flynn andcolleagues (1992, 1994) also suggests that media campaigns combined withother strategies such as school smoking prevention programs are effectivein changing behavior. Thus, although the mechanisms for their effective-ness are not entirely understood, the media play a vital role in assuring thehealth of the public in the twenty-first century. The top priority for the research agenda on the effect of media commu- nication on health behavior is to conduct basic research on how the mediainfluence individual health decisions as well as the public 's health (Logan et al., 1999). This research would attempt to understand how media commu-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

A second priority is to determine which media vehicles should be used for which purposes to determine the most effective way to communicatehealth information to the public. Most research has been conducted withthe understanding that the mass media is useful for raising awareness anddriving the public agenda, but behavioral decisions are also influenced byinterpersonal communication. The interaction between interpersonal com-munication and media messages, however, is not well understood (Valenteand Saba, 1998, 2001). For example, do the media prompt interpersonaldiscussions that then set in motion a series of behavioral change steps? A third priority is to develop the evidence base for how health com- munication can better influence public policy. Research is needed particu-larly on the overall strategies of media advocacy and social marketing foreffecting policy changes, in particular changes that may shape the socialdeterminants of health. Research that can tease out the effects of mediacommunication from community organizing and policy advocacy is alsoneeded. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of which strategies are mostappropriate and suited to which goals would be useful to public healthpractitioners. The committee recommends that public health and commu- nication researchers develop an evidence base on media influences onhealth knowledge and behavior, as well as on the promotion of healthypublic policy. CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS In this age of information, there is good reason to acknowledge the potential of the mass media in assuring population health. Print andbroadcast news media outlets, entertainment television, and the Internetconstitute immensely influential channels through which people gathertheir information, accurate or not, about health. Given the speed anddiversity of media outlets, they cannot be considered mere commentatorsin dialogues on popular culture about health, health risk, and healthbehaviors. They can foster and participate in informal interfaces (e.g.,professional connections and contact points) and formal interfaces (e.g.,fellowships and other cross-training for media and public health profes-sionals) with academia. Also, the media and governmental public healthagencies can enhance their understanding of each other 's methods and perspectives (e.g., through communication between health officials andjournalists or reporters). It is time that media outlets acknowledge theirrole in the public health system, the strength of their influence, and theirpotential for assuring the public 's health.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html3588 Academia The health of the public during the twenty-first century can be assured only through the cooperation and collaboration of many individuals indiverse institutional settings, each of which has important contributions tomake to this important and challenging endeavor. Among the recommen-dations in The Future of Public Health (IOM, 1988), several focused on needed improvements in academia regarding the education of public healthprofessionals. The report called for the following changes: Creating new linkages among public health schools and programs and public health agencies at the federal, state, and local levels; Developing new relationships within universities between public health schools and programs and other professional schools and departments; Formulating more extensive approaches to education that encom- pass the full scope of public health practice; Strengthening the knowledge base in the areas of international health and the health of minority groups; Conducting a wide range of research that includes basic and ap- plied research, as well as research on program evaluation and implementa-tion; and Developing new training opportunities for professionals who are already practicing in public health. There has been progress in most of these areas. For example, collabo- rations and partnerships are receiving increased emphasis, practice-basedCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlACADEMIA 359 research efforts are expanding, and certificate programs and distance- learning programs aimed at providing lifelong learning to practicing publichealth workers have grown. Much more can be achieved, but these im-provements are dependent on a critical analysis of the functions ofacademia, an examination of academia 's potential contributions to the public health system, and a discussion of recommendations made to en-hance academia 's capacity to make these contributions. Academia performs three important functions within the public health system. These are to (1) educate and train public health workers; (2)conduct basic and applied research in disciplines pertinent to public health;and (3) engage in community, public, and professional service. Of course,academia is not the only institution that provides education, research, andservice. Federal, state, and local public health agencies, for example, pro-vide training to public health workers. Public health agencies and theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conduct community-based research. Federal and state health agencies collect and disseminatevaluable, credible information and statistics for the nation through ve-hicles such as the National Health Interview Survey, the Vital Statisticssystem, and the publication Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report . The Public Health Faculty/Agency Forum, convened by CDC and the HealthResources and Services Administration (HRSA), illustrates one way inwhich nonacademic institutions convene and foster cooperation and coor-dination between academia and public health agencies in support of com-munity health. Although numerous federal, state, and local agencies make important contributions through education and training, information dissemination,collaborative activities, and research, these functions are central to themission of academia. These functions are not, however, mutually exclusive.For example, service learning (defined as a method by which students learnthrough active participation in organized service experiences that meet ac-tual community needs [Rhoads and Howard, 1998]) can be classified underthe education and training function as well as the service function. Commu-nity-based participatory research is another example. Although it is clearlyclassified under the research function of academia, this approach to re-search is also a component of the service function because it is conducted ina collaborative fashion with the community and addresses problems identi-fied as important by the community. The emphasis of this chapter is on how academia fulfills its responsi- bilities for assuring the health of the public through education (and train-ing), research, and service. For the purposes of this discussion, \"academia \" refers to all units within community and 4-year colleges and universitiesthat contribute to assuring the health of the population.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html360 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC'S HEALTH EDUCATION AND TRAINING The \"most distinctive role of public health education lies in the prepa- ration of public health professionals \" (Fineberg et al., 1994). Because of the critical role of education in preparing public health professionals to func-tion effectively, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) convened the Committeeon Educating Public Health Professionals for the 21st Century that, concur-rent with the work of the Committee on Assuring the Health of the Publicin the 21st Century, has conducted an in-depth examination of the futureneeds of public health professional education and developed a frameworkand recommendations for how, over the next 5 to 10 years, education,training, and research in programs and schools of public health can bestrengthened to prepare future public health professionals to improve popu-lation health. Given the in-depth examination and analysis of public health education that was undertaken by the IOM Committee on Educating Public HealthProfessionals for the 21st Century, the present report will not go into detailabout the future of public health education but, rather, will briefly describethe kinds of degree and professional development programs available, dis-cusses the current workforce and its training needs, identifies problems andbarriers to providing public health education, and makes recommendationsfor maximizing academia 's contributions to the education of the current and future public health workforce. People who work as professionals in the public health system receive their education and training in a wide range of disciplines and in diverseacademic settings, including schools of public health, medicine, nursing,dentistry, social work, allied health professions, pharmacy, law, publicadministration, veterinary medicine, engineering, environmental sciences,biology, microbiology, and journalism. The master of public health (MPH) is the basic professional degree tradi- tionally earned by public health workers, but many college graduates whowork in public health are educated in other health professions. For example,nurses make up about 10.9 percent of the total public health workforce,whereas physicians comprise about 1.3 percent (HRSA, 2000a). The doctorof public health (DrPH) is offered for advanced training in public healthleadership. Individuals with academic degrees (e.g., a master of science ordoctorate) in the public health disciplines such as epidemiology, biostatistics,environmental health, health services and administration, nutrition, and thesocial and behavioral sciences also may be found in the larger state and localpublic health agencies and in the health care delivery system. The 32 accredited schools of public health, along with the 45 accred- ited MPH programs, supply the bulk of public health graduates. The Asso-ciation of Schools of Public Health (ASPH), the organization that repre-sents accredited schools of public health, reports that in 1998 -1999, the 29Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlACADEMIA 361 accredited schools of public health graduated 5,568 students. Of all degree recipients, 89.9 percent received a master 's degree (61.5 percent received an MPH degree) and 10.1 percent received doctoral degrees (of these, 6.7percent received a doctor of philosophy [PhD] degree and 2 percent re-ceived a DrPH degree) (ASPH, 2000). It is estimated that accredited gradu-ate programs in community health and preventive medicine and in commu-nity health education graduate an additional 700 to 800 master 's degree students each year (Davis and Dandoy, 2001). Many of these graduateprograms in public health are represented by the Association of Teachers ofPreventive Medicine. Additionally, in 1997 -1998 there were 9,947 master 's graduates of programs of public administration and public affairs, many ofwhom emphasized health policy and management and public health in theirtraining (National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administra-tion, 1998). The Association of University Programs in Health Administra-tion reports that in 2000 there were 1,778 graduates who received master 's degrees (in health administration); some (an unknown number) of themreceived the MPH and master of science degrees (Association of UniversityPrograms in Health Administration, 2000). Many public health workersalso receive undergraduate training from 4-year institutions that offer pro-grams in the environmental sciences or in health education and healthpromotion. These programs can offer valuable continuing education tohealth workers by providing current scientific information in many special-ized areas. Those who graduate with training in public health are only a small part of the public health workforce. Although it is unclear exactly how manypublic health workers there are in the United States today, it is estimatedthat about 450,000 people are employed in salaried positions in publichealth and that an additional 2.85 million people volunteer their services(HRSA, 2000a). This is probably an undercount because, according toHRSA, states reporting the number of workers within their jurisdictionsalmost never include information about public health workers found innongovernmental and community partner agencies. Additionally, limitedinformation is obtained regarding the numbers of volunteers and salariedstaff in voluntary agencies. Kennedy and colleagues (1999), in an 18-month study of the Texas public health workforce, counted nearly 17,700 professional public healthworkers in that state. Only one-third of the professional publichealth workforce identified in that study was employed in officialpublic health agencies, and only an estimated 7 percent had formal educa-tion in public health. Nationally, it is estimated that about 80 percent ofpublic health workers lack basic training in public health (CDC, 2001a).Furthermore, only 22 percent of chief executives of local health depart-ments have graduate degrees in public health (Turnock, 2001).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html362 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH Public Health Education and Training Basic public health training has changed over the years. Early public health efforts in the United States were directed toward improving sanita-tion and ensuring the safety of the food and water supply, controllinginfectious diseases, and providing immunizations to children. Thus, in theearly 1900s, the public health workforce was trained primarily in medicine,nursing, and the biological sciences (Brandt and Gardner, 2000; Garrett,2000; Mullan, 2000). Basic public health training now requires an ap-proach that incorporates understanding of the following: Health problems must be examined in the context of defined popu- lations; Many problems of public health are deeply rooted in the behavior of individuals and in their social context; Public health problems of the twenty-first century are rooted in the technologies of economic development; and Public health problems continue to require the engagement of the body politic, in the form of government participation, for their solution(Fineberg et al., 1994). Additionally, changing demographics in the United States and the im- portance of community engagement in problem solving contribute to theneed for a more broadly trained and diverse workforce. Involvement inglobal health issues also argues for increased attention to workforce diver-sity, but achieving such diversity in the workforce is a major challenge forgovernmental public health agencies and other public health entities be-cause of the inadequate number of students and faculty from ethnic minor-ity groups. Without high school and undergraduate degree programs inpublic health, there is little exposure of potential minority candidates topublic health as a career option. A related issue is the lack of ethnic minor-ity faculty in programs and schools of public health. Public health agencies,schools and programs of public health, professional organizations, andother components of the public health system need to devote major effortsto identify and facilitate, through funding and other mechanisms, ap-proaches to increase cultural diversity, as well as to enhance awareness ofglobal health issues among public health faculty, students, and staff. Forexample, many schools of public health have established programs thatprovide students with practical experiences working abroad, offer short-term international internships as well as fellowship programs related toglobal health, and engage in international research collaboration on majorglobal health issues. Recent efforts directed toward achieving the goal of a broadly trainedCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlACADEMIA 363 workforce have focused on identifying basic competencies in public health and developing curricula that teach the information and skills necessary tomeet those competencies. A number of different organizations have tackledthis task. For example, the Pew Health Professions Commission (O 'Neil, 1998) has developed a set of 21 competencies for successful practice thatapply to physicians, nurses, and allied health professionals. The Council onLinkages Between Academia and Public Health Practice has developed a setof core competencies for public health professionals that apply to three jobcategories: frontline staff, senior-level staff, and supervisory managementstaff (Council on Linkages, 2001). The ASPH has endorsed the core competencies developed by the Coun- cil on Linkages and plans to develop additional and complementary compe-tencies for MPH students. Furthermore, the CDC Office of WorkforcePolicy and Planning (CDC, 2001b) has developed a table of competencysets (see Appendix E), differentiated into the categories of Core-basic public health (addresses the essential services of public health); New topical areas (emergency response, genomics, law, infor- matics); Functional areas (leadership, management, supervisory, secretarial); Discipline-specific areas (professional, technical, entry-level stu- dents); and Other topical areas (e.g., maternal and child health, environmental health, health communication, sexually transmitted diseases). The preparation of students and workers to engage in effective public health practice requires not only a definition of competencies but also aneducational approach that encompasses a necessarily broad range of skillsand information. Integrated approaches to education and training are crucial. Integrated Interdisciplinary Learning One example of an effort to promote an integrated approach to educa- tion is the Medicine/Public Health Initiative, a national consortium createdin 1994 under the joint leadership of the American Medical Associationand the American Public Health Association and involved in efforts toimprove the working relationship and bridge the gap between medical andpublic health practitioners. The initiative has the following seven primarygoals: 1. To engage the community and change existing thinking to focus on improving the health of the community.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html364 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH 2. To change the educational process so that public health and medi- cine can enhance their understanding of each other 's practices. 3. To create joint research efforts by developing a common research agenda for public health and medicine by using the threefold approach ofrelaying advantages of joint research, using preventive medicine certifica-tion and training as a form of integrated learning, and supporting thefunding of research that links medicine and public health. 4. To devise a shared view of health and illness so that public health and medicine can use a common conceptual framework of health and illness. 5. To work together in health care provision and integrate health promotion and prevention into clinical health care delivery systems. 6. To jointly develop health care assessment measures such as quality, effectiveness, and outcome evaluations. 7. To translate Initiative ideas into action. The Initiative 's work led to the development of a program that funded 19 collaborative projects around the country (Phillips, 2000). The Agencyfor Health Care Policy and Research also funded three projects aiming toenhance cooperation between the medical and public health communities inthe context of community-based health programs (AHCPR, 1997). Preventive medicine certification and training is another example of inte- grated interdisciplinary learning. In preventive medicine training, the primaryemphasis is on disease prevention and health promotion. There are currently6,091 certified preventive medicine specialists in the United States, but theproportion of these specialists among all U.S. physicians is on the decline.The decline has been greatest among those training in public health, with theprimary reason for the decline being inadequate funding (Lane, 2000). In addition, it is critical for public health education to cross traditional boundaries and link more effectively with the educational programs forother health professionals. In 1998, the Josiah Macy, Jr., Foundation spon-sored a conference entitled Education for More Synergistic Practice of Medi-cine and Public Health (Hager, 1999). The goal of the conference was todevelop recommendations on how public health practitioners and physi-cians can be trained to collaborate with one another. During the confer-ence, Lasker (1999) emphasized the importance of public health educationfor medical students, whereas Lumpkin (1999) discussed what to teachstudents of public health about medical practice. He pointed out that be-cause of the changes in the issues facing public health, enrolling students nolonger come primarily from the medical or nursing profession. This, inturn, means that those students do not have a working knowledge of thebiomedical basis of medical treatment or of the medical treatment system. To gain needed exposure to the academic disciplines and the actual practices of their counterparts, medical students must become acquaintedCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlACADEMIA 365 with epidemiology, biostatistics, public health policy, the elements of pre- vention, and other essentials of public health, whereas students of publichealth require familiarization with the workings of the health care deliverysystem, the pharmacological and therapeutic treatment of disease, and tech-niques of dealing with individual patients (Hagar, 1999). Nursing education is another area for integrated interdisciplinary learn- ing, such as linkages with education in public health. Although schools ofnursing require course work in community and public health nursing at thebachelor 's level, there is a great deal of variation in the content of these programs. In 2001, there were 85 schools of nursing that offered master 's degrees in community health and/or public health nursing (Berlin, 2002).Model curricula incorporating public health content into bachelor 's nurs- ing curricula are lacking; an insufficient number of nursing faculty areprepared in public health; and access to public health agencies for popula-tion-based clinical experience is often a problem, as is access to continuingeducation in population-based public health and public health nursing. Foradditional information about preparing nurses to enter the public healthworkforce, refer to Who Will Keep the Public Healthy? (IOM, 2003). Unfortunately, efforts to integrate teaching across schools and depart- ments face several institutional barriers. First, most schools and colleges aredepartmentalized, with the resources provided for teaching distributedamong the departments. Departmental priorities lie with ensuring thatcourses for majors and service courses are taught within the department 's discipline. Faculty who teach departmental, discipline-based courses areprovided with both monetary support for teaching such courses and recog-nition by their departmental colleagues for contributing to the department 's teaching load. At present, either integrated interdisciplinary courses must receive funding from sources outside the various departments involved, or eachdepartment supporting the disciplines involved in integrated interdiscipli-nary courses must agree to contribute faculty teaching time to the teach-ing efforts. Even when such agreements among departments can bereached, faculty are still reluctant to participate because the developmentand teaching of integrated interdisciplinary courses usually require moretime than that required to teach a course in one 's own discipline. This additional time is usually not recognized in either commensurate pay orteaching credit. A second disincentive for faculty participation in integrated interdisci- plinary educational approaches relates to promotion and salary review.Faculty teaching integrated interdisciplinary courses may be penalized dur-ing promotion and salary merit review because their departmental col-leagues know little of their interdisciplinary teaching activities or do notvalue such activities as highly as they value contributions to the department 'sCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html366 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH curriculum. Because integrated interdisciplinary teaching is important to the preparation of a well-trained workforce that is capable of addressingtoday 's broad array of public health issues, academic institutions must ensure that funds are available for integrated interdisciplinary teachingactivities and must provide incentives in their reward structures for facultyparticipating in such activities. The emerging focus of a broad education based on competencies, both basic and discipline specific, is important. However, the need for publichealth students to understand medical practice and for physicians to under-stand public health practice, including the ethical and legal foundations ofpublic health, must be kept in mind. The committee endorses the findings ofthe Macy Foundation conference \u2014that there must be greater synergy be- tween education for medicine and education for public health \u2014and ex- tends that endorsement of synergy to education in other clinical healthscience professions. Therefore, the committee recommends that academic institutions in- crease integrated interdisciplinary learning opportunities for students inpublic health and other related health science professions. Such effortsshould include not only multidisciplinary education but also interdiscipli-nary education and appropriate incentives for faculty to undertake suchactivities . Additional discussion of the need to increase collaboration and education between public health and other health professions can be foundin the report Who Will Keep the Public Healthy? , developed by the IOM Committee on Educating Public Health Professionals for the 21st Century(IOM, 2003). Public health workers should be trained in a set of core public health competencies and should have opportunities for practical experience; andadditional education and training must be tailored to and depend on theexperiences, activities, and functions of particular groups. For example,current MPH students have training needs that differ from those of pastgraduates of such programs who have been practicing for many years in apublic health agency. The training needs of public health nurses differ incritical ways from the training needs of health educators, administrators,and environmental professionals. Identification of these specific trainingneeds requires assessment and evaluation. Solloway and colleagues (1997) reported on a study funded by HRSA to assess state agency-based health workforce capacity and examine statetraining and educational needs in five states: Illinois, Maryland, Missouri,Oregon, and Rhode Island. The authors report that most state public healthworkers have no formal education or training in the field of public health,lack a good understanding of the goals and mission of public health, and donot have a full understanding of the activities carried out by public healthCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

They identified educa- tional and training needs in eight areas: 1. Information systems and computer skills 2. Technical writing and presentation skills3. Research and policy development skills4. Management and administrative skills5. Grantsmanship6. Public relations7. Transition skills8. Leadership skills The study also found that states need federal support to obtain tech- nical assistance for the acquisition and use of new technologies fordistance-based or remote-site learning, ongoing financial support, andsymbolic support demonstrating that training and education are valuedand are priorities. Another study conducted by Reder and colleagues (1999) assessed the training needs of public health professionals in Washington State. Theyfound that communication was the area in which public health profession-als require the most training, with the four most highly rated topics beinginterpersonal communication, cross-cultural and cross-age communication,electronic communication, and participatory teaching and training skills. The educational and training needs of the current public health workforce are enormous and multifaceted. Academia has an essential andunique role to play in ensuring that broad-based educational and trainingopportunities are available on a regional basis. All accredited MPH pro-grams, school based or otherwise, are required to provide some continuingeducation; however, what is offered varies widely depending on the avail-able resources and expertise. With the advent of new and expanding infor-mation technologies, the opportunity for schools and programs to provideeducation and training to a broader audience via distance learning is in-creasing rapidly. The means for achieving this are discussed further in thechapter on the governmental public health infrastructure (Chapter 3). Al-though academia can play a leadership role in the coordination of variouseducational and training opportunities for the public health workforce, itcannot meet all of these needs. In some cases, practitioners in the field canbest provide in-service training. Funding of Public Health Professional Education and Training A current lack of funding is a major problem in providing training and education for both students seeking degrees and those already in the publicCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

According to Gebbie (1999), the primary barrier to workforce development is the \"incredibly weak \" budget allocated for training. This has not always been the case, however. Over the past fivedecades, the major sources of funds for the training of students in publichealth were HRSA and CDC. Table 8 -1 provides a chronology of legisla- tion authorizing funds for health professional training in public healthbetween 1956 and 1976 (DHHS, 1980). In 1976, Congress passed the Health Professions Educational Assis- tance Act (P.L. 94 -484). This act provided for a number of programs in health professions education, including Extensions of existing public health traineeships. Grants to accredited schools of public health for student traineeships. A separate program of grants to public or nonprofit private edu- cational entities (excluding schools of public health) that offered an ac-credited program in health administration, hospital administration, orhealth policy analysis and planning. Funding to public or nonprofit private educational entities (ex- cluding schools of public health) for graduate programs in health admin-istration. Grants to assist accredited schools of public health and other public or nonprofit educational entities with accredited graduate pro-grams in health administration, health planning, or health policy analysisand planning in meeting costs of special projects to develop new programsor expand existing ones in the same four public health disciplines men-tioned above. A requirement for the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in coordination with the National Center for Health Statistics, to continu-ously develop and disseminate statistics and other information on thesupply of and need for different types of public and community healthpersonnel. Between 1980 and 1987, spending by the Bureau of Health Profes- sions (which is part of HRSA in the Department of Health and HumanServices [DHHS]) for education in all health professions declined yearly,from a high of $411,469,000 in 1980 to $189,353,000 in 1987. General-purpose traineeship grants to schools of public health went from$6,842,000 in 1980 to $2,958,000 in 1987. Curriculum developmentgrants, funded at $7,456,000 in 1980, were not funded at all in 1981 and1982; but the funding recovered slowly in 1983, with funding at$1,740,000, and increased in 1984 to $2,856,000 and reached $9,787,000in 1987.

All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlACADEMIA 371 The Bureau of Health Professions has begun to create a nationwide network of Public Health Training Centers (HRSA, 2000b). The purpose ofthe program is to improve the nation 's public health system by strengthen- ing the technical, scientific, managerial, and leadership competence of thecurrent and future public health workforce. Each of the Public HealthTraining Centers for each respective state or region will work to Assess the educational needs of and training materials and facilities available to local and state public health agencies; Use distance-learning technology and other new educational ap- proaches to provide both basic and specialized public health education; Improve public health providers ' ability to interpret and make in- formed decisions based on relevant data and information; Establish on-site educational programs in underserved areas; Develop field-based educational opportunities for students from traditional on-campus graduate public health programs; Develop new curricula for public health practitioners on emerging public health issues such as bioterrorism, behavioral and mental health,domestic and societal violence, and environmental health issues; and Train lay workers from local boards of health and community health offices. The centers are designed to offer training and continuing education programs to about 100,000 public health students and professionals eachyear. To date, 14 centers have been funded. These centers involve 35 aca-demic institutions and more than 42 states. Funding levels range fromabout $250,000 to $500,000 per year per center, although the recom-mended levels were $1 million. Although this is a needed program, fundsare insufficient to compensate for the reduction in training funds experi-enced over the past two decades. Adequate funding, especially in states withsmall and medium populations, would create the opportunity to releasestaff to prepare and provide training programs and to increase the numberof sessions provided. Additionally, adequate funding would allow the train-ing center to hire distance-learning specialists to aid in the preparation ofcourses. CDC has also been a major supporter of education for public health professionals. The CDC Graduate Certificate Program (GCP) was a feder-ally sponsored initiative directed primarily toward CDC field officers, statehealth department personnel, and selected others with at least 3 to 5 yearsof experience in public health practice. The programs were designed formidcareer professionals in public health practice who desired to furthertheir professional standing. The program provided the means by which Pub-lic Health Advisors working in state and local health departments across thecountry could earn a graduate certificate in public health from one of fourCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html372 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH accredited schools of public health: Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, Emory University Rollins School of Public Health,Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, and Univer-sity of Washington School of Public Health and Community Medicine. Although originally designed for CDC staff, the GCP was later opened to all interested public health professionals. Core courses in epidemiology,health policy, health management, biostatistics, behavioral sciences, andhealth education were typically delivered in the first half of the program. Inthe later phase, students focused on one of the following specialty tracks:epidemiology and surveillance, health policy and management, or commu-nity health. The Graduate Certificate Program in Public Health began in1996 and ended in January 2001, leaving programs with no resources tocontinue the training program. In recent years, schools of public health have made praiseworthy efforts to form critical links with practice and community sectors. Most schools ofpublic health now require practicums of their students; the development ofcollaborations and partnerships has received increasing emphasis (discussedbelow in the section Service); practice-based research efforts have beenexpanded (discussed in the section Research); and certificate programs anddistance-learning programs aimed at providing lifelong learning to practic-ing public health workers have grown. Development of certificate programs that emphasize core public health concepts is one response to the 1988 recommendation for programs aimedat educating the current workforce. This type of certificate is an abbrevi-ated version of the MPH. The content of the program tends to emphasizethe concepts from the five core content areas of knowledge basic to publichealth taught in MPH programs. Some schools also offer certificate pro-grams that follow courses of study in the specific content areas of publichealth. Admissions standards and completion requirements vary with eachcertificate program. Courses within certificate programs generally must betaken for academic credit. The certificate is issued by the sponsor uponsatisfactory completion of course work. Academic institutions also offer summer institutes and courses aimed at the current workforce. A variety of subjects are covered in this manner,from basic biostatistics, epidemiology, and geographic information systemapplications to management and administration for middle to upper man-agers. Such programs can range in length from a 1-day course to weeklongofferings. At present, the majority of students pursuing degrees in profes-sional public health programs are educated via classroom-based instruc-tion. Such face-to-face contact in teaching is important for a number ofreasons, not the least of which is that these close and continuing relation-ships help break down racial, cultural, and class barriers and promote trustand a sense of community (Citrin, 2001). Additionally, most planning andCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlACADEMIA 373 collaborative work is best done at meetings and work sessions that physi- cally bring people together. Many academic institutions, along with state health agencies and CDC, offer short courses, seminars, or workshops addressing specific publichealth training needs. One approach taken to meet the demand fordistance-based training is the Public Health Training Network. This net-work has provided training to nearly 1 million people on a wide range ofsubjects in a variety of formats: print-based self-instruction, interactivemultimedia, videoconferences (CDC, 2001c). As distance-learning technology improves and new electronic delivery modalities become more widespread, online in-service training opportuni-ties will be more accessible. These new approaches under development willassist in providing training opportunities for public health workers who arenot able to participate in classroom-based educational programs. The useof web-based tools for education is referred to as distance learning (Riegelman and Persily, 2001). Distance-learning programs and new infor-mation technologies are perceived to be a boon to meeting the educationalneeds of the public health workforce in the United States (Cannon et al.,2001). Although this development builds on more than two decades ofcomputer networking activities (e.g., e-mail and bulletin board systems),increased access to the Internet has produced phenomenal growth in theextent and scope of online education. Teaching and learning on the WorldWide Web demand new and special skills from teachers and learners alike. Another educational approach attracting attention is service learning, defined as the \"method under which students learn and develop through active participation in thoughtfully organized service experiences that meetactual community needs, that are integrated into the student 's academic curriculum or provide structured time for reflection, and that enhance whatis taught in school by extending student learning beyond the classroom andinto the community \" (Rhoads and Howard, 1998). According to Porter and Monard (2001) \"understanding and fostering reciprocity is a central aim of service-learning programs, \" meaning that service-learning programs differ from other practical educational approaches in that their intent is tobenefit both the provider and the recipient of the service and to emphasizeequally the provision of service and the learning experience (Cauley et al.,2001). According to Howard (2001), three criteria must be met for a course to be considered service learning: 1. Service that is both relevant and meaningful to all stakeholder parties must be provided in the community.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html374 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH 2. The service must not only serve the community but also enhance student academic learning. 3. The service must also directly and intentionally prepare students for active civic participation in a diverse democratic society. Service-learning programs benefit the community, the student, and academia. Academia depends on this type of learning to teach studentsabout real-world public health. Students are able to translate their aca-demic learning into practice activities. The community, particularly in ruraland inner-city areas that may be experiencing a shortage of health profes-sionals, is able to reap the benefit of services provided by students in theselearning situations. On the basis of the findings detailed in the preceding pages, the com- mittee identifies the need for increased funding of public health training andeducation. Funding is needed to support existing and emerging mechanismsfor training and education of public health students, public health workers,and others. The committee recommends that Congress increase funding for HRSA programs that provide financial support for students enrolled inpublic health degree programs through mechanisms such as training grants,loan repayments, and service obligation grants. Funding should also beprovided to strengthen the Public Health Training Center program to effec-tively meet the educational needs of the existing public health workforceand to facilitate public health worker access to the centers. Support forleadership training of state and local health department directors and localcommunity leaders should continue through funding of the National andRegional Public Health Leadership Institutes and distance-learning materialsdeveloped by HRSA and CDC. The following section discusses the second important contribution of academia, research. RESEARCH Relevant, high-quality research is essential to health assessment, policy development, and assurance. Such research provides fresh insights and cre-ative solutions to health problems and supplies the evidence base necessaryfor policy development and assurance activities. Public health practice isgrounded in science, both the traditional medical and natural sciences (e.g.,biology, microorganisms, vectors, and risks in the physical environment)and, increasingly, the social and behavioral sciences (e.g., anthropology,sociology, and psychology) that \"affect our understanding of human cul- ture and behaviors influencing health and illness \" (Turnock, 2001). It is in academia that most such research is conducted. In addition to basic biomedi-cal research and epidemiological studies that contribute to an understandingCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlACADEMIA 375 of what makes people healthy, research on the multiple determinants of health has begun to enrich the understanding of the numbers and complexi-ties of factors that determine the health of the population (see Chapter 2 fora more comprehensive discussion of the determinants of health). Increased understanding of the determinants of health has demonstrated the importance of social and behavioral factors to health. McGinnis andFoege (1993) reported that about half of all causes of mortality in theUnited States are linked to social and behavioral factors and accidents.Several studies have shown the relationship between unintentional injuriesand certain risk factors: for example, accessibility to firearms, use of alco-hol and tobacco, and use of seat belts (Turnock, 2001). Other research hasshown the influence of psychological risk factors on disease; for example,the management of diabetes is influenced by coping skills and familystresses; other research demonstrates that acute stress may trigger myocar-dial ischemia (IOM, 2001). Another important area for increased research is public health systems research. Bialek (2000) makes the point that there is little scientific evidenceabout what constitutes effective public health departments. He defines pub-lic health systems research as \"a field of inquiry using quantitative or qualitative methodology to examine the impact of the organization, financ-ing, staffing, and management of systems on the access to, delivery, cost,outcomes, and quality of population-based services. \" Turnock (2001) states that improving public health practice requires research that explicates thelinks and relationships of key processes, programs, and services or outputs.The limited amount of public health systems research conducted to date hasproduced some important findings, such as the findings that the effective-ness of local health departments does not appear to be influenced by juris-diction size and full-time leadership appears to positively influence effec-tiveness (Bialek, 2000). The committee believes that public health systemsresearch is an important area for increased attention. Despite the many achievements of research, much remains to be accom- plished. The vast majority of the nation 's health research resources have been directed toward biomedical research endeavors that cannot, by them-selves, address the most significant challenges to improving the public 's health (IOM, 2000). Past and current research funding priorities focusespecially on risk factor identification through either large- or small-scaleepidemiological studies . Comparatively few resources have been devoted to supporting prevention research, community-based research, or the transla-tion of research findings into practice. For example, in the area of obesity,a great deal of research is needed about causes and about appropriate andeffective interventions. Despite a significant reduction since 1990 in theamount of dietary fat consumed by the population, the rate of obesity hasincreased significantly. Clearly, achieving a reduction in obesity is not asCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Only 1 to 2 percent of the U.S. health care budget is spent on preven- tion, and a like imbalance exists between funding for basic biomedicalresearch and for population-based prevention research (Scrimshaw et al.,2001). As a consequence, although the scientific literature includes an enor-mous amount of information about physical and biological risk factors fordisease and disability, as well as more limited information about social andbehavioral determinants of health, little of this knowledge has been trans-lated into forms that are accessible or useful to local public health practitio-ners or to the community. Although many scholars agree on the importance of prevention research, exact definitions of the term vary. According to Scrimshawand colleagues (2001), this \"lack of a consistent definition for preven- tion research decreases the conceptual clarity of the term and impedesthe development of a clear understanding of prevention research. \" Brownson and Simoes (1999) assert that prevention research focuses ondetermining the underlying causes of death, injury, and disability; re-search discoveries are then applied at the community level. CDC de-fines prevention research as research directly applicable to public healthpractice (Doll et al., 2001). Sattin (2001) states that prevention re-search is a multidisciplinary approach to discovering new ways to pro-long the health, well-being, and self-sufficiency of all Americans; itfocuses on preventing disease, injury, and disability. Scrimshaw andcolleagues (2001) describe how prevention is frequently defined in termsof the self-interest of the person giving the definition. Prevention is frequently categorized into three levels: primary, second- ary, and tertiary. Primary prevention in public health is aimed at preventingan illness or disability from occurring. Secondary prevention efforts includeinterventions in illness to prevent continued illness or disability, whereastertiary prevention activities attempt to limit further progression of illnessor disability or to postpone death. Clinical preventive services are generallyconsidered secondary or tertiary preventions. To increase the clarity of itsdiscussion, the committee has chosen to define population-based preven-tion research using a modified version of the definition developed by theAssociation of Schools of Public Health (Spencer, 2000) for population-based prevention research, which Addresses health problems that affect large numbers of people; Involves a definable population and operates at the level of the whole person; Evaluates the application and impacts of new discoveries on the actual health of the population; andCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlACADEMIA 377 Focuses on behavioral or environmental (social, economic, cul- tural, physical) factors associated with primary and secondary preventionof disease in populations; the behavioral, biological, or clinical variationsamong populations; or the integration of behavioral, biological, and envi-ronmental factors. As discussed previously, prevention research (including clinical preventive services research) has been underfunded and undervalued, yet it is crucial tounderstanding how to improve health. The following section of this chapterdiscusses the specific research approaches that the committee believes will, ifproperly funded, contribute greatly to the understanding of the determinants ofhealth and to evaluation of the effectiveness of public health interventions. Population-Based Research The term population-based research means that the research focuses on groups or populations rather than individuals (Scrimshaw et al., 2001).Population-based research draws on populations or random samples ofpopulations at a national, state, or local level. In general, it builds on anunderstanding of the determinants of health that includes multiple levels ofinfluence, from environmental (both social and physical) to behavioral toindividual (biological, genetic). Although all research does not incorporateall potential levels, increased understanding of etiology and preventionwill come about by working at multiple levels. Examples of well-knownpopulation-based research include the Framingham Heart Study, whichcontinues to yield new insights, and the Woman 's Health Initiative (see Box 8 -1). Although population-based studies are often used to generate hypoth- eses about the potential risk factors for disease, population studies can alsotest hypotheses developed in earlier studies. Most of the earlier population-based data collection focused on the biological and environmental riskfactors for disease. There is, however, an increasingly rich amount of dataabout the social determinants of health (see Chapter 2), and investigatorsare poised on the brink of being able to link these social risk factors withbiomedical factors, thereby developing a more complex model of diseaseand health through population-based studies. Community-Based Research Community-based research is an overarching concept of collaborative research that encompasses many different types of studies (e.g., applied,descriptive, and evaluative). Community-based participatory research is de-fined as research that involves all stakeholders in each aspect of a studyCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html378 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH designed to evaluate the application and impact of new discoveries aimed at improving the health of a defined population, frequently involving the evalu-ation of interventions designed to promote health in community settings. Community-based research is often divided into three distinct phases: formative, process, and summative (Valente, 2002). The length and natureof each of these stages vary depending on the type of project and type ofstudy, but some general parameters can be described. Community-basedresearch requires active partnerships between the community and research-ers who may or may not be members of that community (Green et al.,2001). Partnerships and coalitions are necessary because no one agency hasthe resources, access, and trust relationships to address the wide range ofcommunity determinants of public health problems (Green et al., 2001).Clark (1999) states that research needs a three-way partnership of academia,public health practice groups, and community-based organizations. A keyfactor in establishing successful partnerships is trust (Nelson et al., 1999).Lack of trust and perceived lack of respect are frequently perceived tohinder effective community-based research (Israel et al., 1998).BOX 8-1 Research Definitions for Academia The term population based means that the research focuses on groups or pop- ulations rather than individuals (Scrimshaw et al., 2001). The following definitionsare used in this report: Basic (or fundamental) research\u2014 research conducted for the purpose of ad- vancing knowledge with little concern for any immediate or practical benefits. Applied research\u2014 research designed to use the results of other research (e.g., basic research) to solve real-world problems. This type of research is alsocalled translational research by the National Institutes of Health. Evaluative research \u2014the use of scientific research methods to assess the ef- fectiveness of a program or initiative. Descriptive research\u2014 research that attempts to discover facts or describe re- ality (Sullivan, 2001). This includes hypothesis-generating studies, epidemio- logical studies, observational studies, and surveys. Community-based research \u2014a collaborative approach to research that equita- bly involves community members, organizational representatives, and re- searchers in all aspects of the research process (Israel et al., 1998). This def-inition is similar to that used by Green and Mercer (2001) in defining participatory research as an approach that entails the involvement of all poten- tial users of the research and other stakeholders in the formulation as well asthe application of the research.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlACADEMIA 379 The Formative Phase In the first or formative phase, researchers and the community engage in activities that lay the groundwork for a successful partnership (Valente,2002). Such activities include defining and agreeing on the mission, goals,and outcomes of the research; identifying strengths and assets within thecommunity and the research institution; determining responsibilities; andestablishing the decision-making process. Although some relations mayalready exist among potential partners, further developmental activitiesmust be undertaken for each new project. For example, an existing networkor coalition on tobacco prevention may be expanded to include nutritionactivities. This network would then have to conduct a formal needs assess-ment that involves both the researchers and the community to identifyhealth needs and set goals and objectives. The formative phase, whether itentails expanding an existing partnership or developing new relationsamong researchers and the community, is time-consuming and cannot becarried out without sufficient funds to support the activities described. The Process Phase During the process phase, potential intervention strategies and research instruments are designed and pilot tested among small community samples(Valente, 2002). Agreement must be reached on the health promotion strat-egies, specific media and messages, and research instruments after repeatediterations. Once agreement is reached, baseline data are collected and theintervention is implemented. Depending on the nature of the intervention,this phase could be short (e.g., 3 months) or quite long (years). The Summative Phase The summative phase of research begins after the intervention is com- pleted or at a point when some assessment is needed (Valente, 2002). Thesummative phase includes collection of follow-up data and interviews withkey stakeholders (such as project administrators or program recipients).This phase includes data analysis to determine the impact, specify the les-sons learned, and develop recommendations for future activities (e.g.,whether to expand the program and whether or how to modify the pro-gram). The summative phase is iterative because results need to be sharedwith key stakeholders. If the program is expanded and disseminated toother communities or settings, effectiveness evaluation is needed to deter-mine whether the program can be generalized to these other settings andwhat lessons are learned as the program is implemented elsewhere.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

A specific example of community-based research in whichacademia has the potential to contribute in many ways is the CommunityHealth Improvement Process discussed in Chapter 4 (see Figure 8 -1).

However, practice research demonstrates increased relevance to social goals with the translation of research findings into com-munity action, thereby demonstrating the value to the nation of the use ofpublic resources devoted to academic research; communities benefit from aprogram based on knowledge of evidence-based practice and community-relevant issues. Therefore, the committee recommends that federal funders of research and academic institutions recognize and reward faculty scholar-ship related to public health practice research. Funding of Prevention Research The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC, in collaboration with local, state, and other federal health and education agencies, plays a major role in prevention activities in the UnitedStates. In terms of research, CDC defines prevention research as researchthat is directly applicable to public health practice and views it as an impor-tant part of the CDC mission (Doll et al., 2001). CDC has both intramural and extramural research programs. Intramu- ral research (or CDC-directed research) is carried out within its laboratories or in the field in collaboration with state and local health departments.Extramural research , in which decision making regarding the study ap- proach rests with the grantee, was, until the early 1970s, a relatively smallgrants program. During the next two decades it became decentralized, withprograms developed and administered independently through CDC 's Cen- ters, Institutes, and Offices (CIOs). More recently, CDC has begun to ex-pand further as a supporter of extramural research (Doll et al., 2001). CDC has three categories of extramural research programs: (1) pro- gram- or CIO-generated research; (2) investigator-initiated research; and(3) research centers of excellence. The following descriptions and examplesof these types of research are taken from Doll et al. (2001). Program- or CIO-Generated Research In program- or CIO-generated research, the topic (and perhaps the research approach as well) is deter-mined by the CIO, which then publishes a request for application (RFA).Proposals are submitted to the CIO and then reviewed. Research topics inprogram-generated research have included the influence of folic acid onneural tube defects in China and the effectiveness of an intervention toreduce dating violence. Another approach to program-generated research is to enter into coop- erative agreements with health-related professional organizations withwhich CDC has agreements (e.g., the Association of the Schools of PublicHealth, the Minority Health Foundation, and the Association of AmericanCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html382 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH Medical Colleges). Funding announcements are mailed to members of these organizations. Funds for the projects are provided by the CIOs and areadministered by CDC 's Public Health Practice Program Office (PHPPO). Investigator-Initiated Research at CDC In the investigator-initiated approach to research, applicants propose research in topic areas of theirchoosing or under broad topic areas provided by the CIOs. The ExtramuralPrevention Research Program (also known as the Prevention Research Ini-tiative [PRI]) is one of the largest investigator-initiated research efforts atCDC and is administered by PHPPO. In 1999, with a budget of $12.5million, CDC began the PRI and funded 50 research service endeavors atacademic health centers, research centers, and university-affiliated pro-grams. The average grant was approximately $250,000, and most serviceendeavors were funded for 3 years. Awards covered a range of subjects andincluded prevention of specific diseases (e.g., asthma and sexually transmit-ted diseases) and injury prevention (Sattin, 2001). All grants and cooperative agreements in this program are externally peer reviewed and are administered by the scientifically appropriate CIOs.Plans for 2002 called for emphasizing investigator-initiated research grantsin topic areas that cross-cut diseases, injuries, and conditions and thataddress gaps in individual CIO agendas. Awards are to be for largeramounts to allow evaluation of service endeavors targeting large popula-tions or the subgroups at highest risk (Doll et al., 2001). A major problem,however, is the lack of a central, organized focus for investigator-initiatedresearch. There is no defined unit to which applications are submitted, andthere is no single source of information on the availability of grants. All applications submitted to CDC requesting research funding are subject to review. CDC uses two approaches to review applications: (1)objective review and (2) external peer review. Objective review is a process that includes an independent assessment of the technical or scientific meritof research by panels composed of federal reviewers only, predominantlyfrom CDC. The peer review process includes an independent assessment of the technical or scientific merit of research by predominantly nonfederalreviewers, scientists with knowledge and expertise equal to that of theresearchers whose work they review (Sattin, 2001). Although CDC has been active and is a leader in prevention research, there are several barriers to maximizing its investigator-initiated preventionresearch. First, although CDC has recently funded increased numbers ofinvestigator-initiated research projects, this remains a relatively small en-deavor that is too dependent on CIO-specific programs. Another barrierrelates to the fact that CDC staff frequently play a more directive role thanis acceptable for academic research. Additionally, project funding is oftenfor too short a time, and indirect cost allowances (which are based on theCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlACADEMIA 383 assumption that funding is for a health department that already receives substantial CDC funds) are too low to attract researchers from academicinstitutions with higher indirect rates. Although CDC has strengthened its peer review process for investiga- tor-initiated proposals, problems still exist. For example, administrativestaff with no scientific training or scientists with no extramural programtraining frequently manage the peer review process and monitor fundedprojects (Doll et al., 2001). Finally, because CDC has no centralized officefor the planning and coordinating of extramural peer review researchprograms, it is frequently difficult to know where to submit investigator-initiated proposals. Prevention Research Centers The Prevention Research Center (PRC) program was authorized by Congress (P.L. 98 -551) and established by CDC. This program, the largest research center program at CDC, is admin-istered by the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and HealthPromotion (Doll et al., 2001). To be funded as a PRC, a university musthave a school of public health or a school of medicine or osteopathy withan accredited preventive medicine residency program, and the center mustcollaborate with individuals and organizations in the communities to deter-mine research priorities (Doll et al., 2001). Each PRC focuses on projectsrelated to a specific public health theme. The 24 currently funded PRCs andtheir research themes are listed in Table 8 -2. According to Scrimshaw and colleagues (2001), PRCs are the locus of leadership in community-based prevention efforts. They are intended toserve as bridges between science and practice and from academia to stateand local health departments, health care providers and provider organiza-tions, and community organizations, as well as CDC. Evaluation research isembedded in many of the PRC interventions; the centers also train publichealth professionals in applied prevention research (IOM, 1997a).Scrimshaw and colleagues (2001) attribute the successes of the PRCs to thefact that their research is collaborative, community based, interdisciplinaryand multidisciplinary, problem solving and solution oriented, and\"disseminative \" and translatable. Unfortunately, according to the IOM report (1997a) Linking Research and Public Health Practice , PRCs have not achieved the vision for which they were created, in large part because of insufficient funding. None werefunded at their initially recommended level of $1 million per year. MostPRCs received only half of this amount, even though annual inflation in-creases would suggest the need for funding at levels higher than the original$1 million per year. Thus, the PRCs have not been able to build the infra-structure necessary to sustain the prevention research initiatives for whichthey were intended.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

CDC shouldtake steps that include Expanding the external peer review mechanism for review of inves- tigator-initiated research; Allowing research to be conducted over the more generous time lines often required by prevention research; and Establishing a central mechanism for coordination of investigator- initiated proposal submissions. Furthermore, CDC should authorize an analysis of the funding levels necessary for effective Prevention Research Center functioning, taking intoaccount the levels authorized by P.L. 98-551 as well as the amount ofprevention research occurring in other institutions and organizations.TABLE 8 -2 Continued Year First Institution Funded Research Theme University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City 1994 Promoting healthy behavior in Native American populations St. Louis University, St. Louis 1994 Chronic disease prevention in high-risk communities University of South Carolina, Columbia 1993 Promoting health through physical activity University of South Florida, Tampa 1998 Community-based marketing for disease prevention andhealth promotion University of Texas, Houston Health 1986 From healthy children to Science Center healthy adults Tulane Medical Center, New Orleans 1998 Environmental agents and the health of communities University of Washington, Seattle 1986 Keeping older adults healthy and independent by using community partnerships West Virginia University, Morgantown 1994 Health promotion and disease prevention in rural Appalachia Yale University, New Haven 1998 Public health initiatives across the preventionspectrum SOURCE: Doll et al.

All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html386 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH National Institutes of Health The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the single largest source of health research funding, with a fiscal year 2000 research budget of nearly$20 billion (compared to CDC 's total research budget of $570 million) (IOM, 2002). Although NIH emphasizes biomedical research, it is increas-ingly funding what it terms prevention research. It has invested in large-scale community trials (Green et al., 2001), conducts research on risk fac-tors for disease, and evaluates drugs for secondary prevention of disease. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) devel- oped a program in collaboration with the Environmental Protection Agencyand CDC to \"promote translation of basic research findings into applied intervention and prevention methods. \" NIEHS conducts multidisciplinary basic, applied research, and \"community-based prevention research, \" includ- ing studies on the causes and mechanisms of children 's disorders having an environmental etiology; studies to identify relevant environmental exposures;intervention studies to reduce hazardous exposures and their adverse effects;and studies to decrease the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality of environ-mentally related childhood diseases (NIH, 2002a). Eight Centers for Children 's Environmental Health and Disease Pre- vention Research were funded to conduct the first set of studies that willfocus on respiratory disease and growth and development. The NationalInstitute of Child Health and Human Development web page (NIH, 2002b)describes several prevention research projects, which include studies de-signed to conduct the following activities: Test the efficacy of a multicomponent program of school-based interventions for the primary prevention of problem behavior in a sampleof middle school students; Identify determinants of the lack of age-appropriate immuniza- tions; Examine the efficacy of an integrated system of office-based pri- mary pediatric care interventions for the prevention of medically attendedinjuries; Assess determinants of parent-to-child transfer of responsibility for asthma self-management; Determine whether parent and teen expectations predict teens ' driv- ing behaviors during their first year of driving; and Determine relevant factors and effective interventions for family management of type 1 diabetes. Despite the many NIH-funded research activities labeled as prevention research, these efforts tend to focus on individual health and on secondaryprevention and risk factor analysis rather than on the health of populationsCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlACADEMIA 387 (Scrimshaw et al., 2001). This committee has defined community-based prevention research as a collaborative approach that involves all stakehold-ers in each aspect of a study designed to evaluate the application and impactof new discoveries aimed at improving the health of a defined population.The findings detailed in this section demonstrate that assuring adequatefunding for prevention research is a population health priority and is par-ticularly relevant to the work of the nation 's federal agencies engaged in public health research. Therefore, the committee recommends that NIH increase the portion of its budget allocated to population- and community-based prevention research that Addresses population-level health problems; Involves a definable population and operates at the level of the whole person; Evaluates the application and impacts of new discoveries on the actual health of the population; and Focuses on the behavioral and environmental (social, economic, cultural, physical) factors associated with primary and secondary preven-tion of disease and disability in populations. Furthermore, the committee recommends that the Director of NIH report annually to the Secretary of DHHS on the scope of the population-and community-based prevention research activities undertaken by the NIHcenters and institutes. SERVICE Although service has traditionally been viewed as a responsibility of academic faculty, it has been seen as less important than the functions ofteaching and research. However, in public health there is growing discus-sion about the importance of service as a scholarly activity that contributesnot only to the knowledge base but also to improving the health of thepublic. This section examines the role of academia in providing service tothe community through collaborative efforts (participation in training cen-ters and institutes, service learning, and other mechanisms). Next, barriersto active participation in service are discussed, and a recommendation forovercoming the impediments to faculty participation in scholarly serviceactivities is made. A Pew Health Professions Commission report (O 'Neil, 1998) stated, \"The nation and its health professionals will be best served when public service is a significant part of the typical path to professional practice. \" The academic community provides three kinds of service:Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html388 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH 1. Community service , that is, service to state and local health depart- ments, community organizations, and individuals; 2.Policy guidance , that is, helping to inform the public debate; and 3. Service to the profession , for example, providing peer review for professional journals, serving as officers of professional associations, andserving on committees both within academia and for professional organiza-tions. As the center of expertise in research and teaching, academia is uniquely positioned to provide technical assistance and service, based on credibleevidence from its research and the expertise of its faculty and students, forthe development and implementation of programs and policies designed toassure and improve the health of the public. For example, state publichealth departments might use academically developed information aboutcomputer technology and health informatics to implement a statewide sur-veillance and information system. Community workers might use the re-sults of research on nutrition and behavior modification to organize acampaign designed to address the current obesity epidemic. Health caredelivery systems use information and expertise developed in academia todesign and implement smoking cessation programs and to coordinate ef-forts aimed at preventing and managing diabetes. Businesses and employersrely on academia for consultation on the design, implementation, and analy-sis of therapeutic intervention studies. Policy makers might respond toinformation emerging from academia that points to the need for new legis-lative or regulatory programs, for example, the presence of toxic residues inchildren resulting from exposure to residential pesticide use. Finally, themedia use evidence developed in academia to inform the public regardingthe impact of global infections on health. Collaboration As communities try to address their health issues in a comprehensive man- ner, all of the stakeholders will need to sort out their roles and responsi-bilities, which will vary from community to community. These interde- pendent sectors must address issues of shared responsibility for various aspects of community health and individual accountability for their ac-tions. They also must participate in the process of communitywide social change that is necessary for health improvement efforts and related per- formance monitoring to succeed (IOM, 1997b). Fundamental to effective service is effective collaboration. Emerging emphasis is being placed on academia 's participation in collaborations, partnerships, and coalitions as mechanisms for improving the health of thepublic. Nelson and colleagues (1999) define collaboration as \"a purposiveCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlACADEMIA 389 relationship between partners committed to pursuing both an individual and a collective benefit. \" According to Berkowitz (2000), collaboration is \"a method used by members of communities when developing coalitions, by organizations when doing strategic planning, and by researchers whodesire the partnership of those being studied. \" Feighery and Rogers (1990) define a coalition as \"an organization of individuals representing diverse organizations, factions or constituencies who agree to work together inorder to achieve a common goal. \" Collaborations are attractive for a number of reasons. They emphasize communitywide behavioral change through the use of a \"multicomponent, multisector \" approach to changing the environments that establish and maintain behaviors (Roussos and Fawcett, 2000). Success in affectingtoday 's public health problems and their determinants requires the resources and trust relationships of a broad-based coalition of partners (Green et al.,2001). Bringing together people with different perspectives increases thepotential to identify new and better ways of thinking about health issues(Lasker, 2000). Additionally, governmental financial and programmaticconstraints require health partnerships, coalitions, and shared resources toachieve public health objectives (Baker et al., 1994). What makes for a successful collaboration? The results of a study conducted by Kegler and colleagues (1998) to identify factors that contrib-ute to coalition effectiveness suggest that coalitions with higher-qualityaction plans are better able to mobilize resources and implement activities,and that good communication, devotion of sufficient staff time to the coa-lition, a sense of cohesion, and a defined structure with multiple task forcesappear to be related to the ability to implement activities. Such findingssupport the idea that developmental or formative activities are importantfor project success. Butterfoss and colleagues (1993) suggest that coalitionsdevelop in stages (formation, implementation, maintenance, and outcomes)and that different sets of factors may be important to coalition functioningat each stage. For example, articulation of a clear mission, a spirit ofcooperation, and positive expectations of outcomes are important duringthe formation stage, whereas formalization or definition of operationalprocedures, a strong central leadership, pooling of member assets (e.g., staffsupport, fundraising capability, meeting space, and access to relevant policymakers), the degree of membership participation, the continued perceptionof the partners that the benefits outweigh the costs of participation, andskills training are important during the implementation and maintenancestages. Active involvement by many different parts of the community is be- lieved to increase the likelihood of success for collaborative efforts (Feigheryand Rogers, 1990; Israel et al., 1998; Lantz et al., 2001; Seifer and Krauer,2001). Coalitions take time to coalesce; and the issues to be addressedCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html390 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH immediately include agreement on a mission statement with goals and ob- jectives, clarification of roles and relationships, definition of a decision-making process, development of an organizational structure, the frequencyand length of meetings, and the benefits for each member of the coalition(Feighery and Rogers, 1990). The benefits of successful collaborative efforts and partnerships are many. Collaborations can reduce disparity in access to information, re-sources, and skills; increase public health 's understanding of community needs and assets; and lead to the development of a process for continualimprovement in public policy and health systems (Berkowitz, 2000). Addi-tional benefits include the freedom to become involved in new issues with-out bearing sole responsibility for managing or developing those issues;developing widespread public support for issues, actions, or unmet needs;developing a critical mass for action; minimizing duplication of effort andservices; mobilizing a broad array of talents, resources, and approaches toproblem solving; providing a mechanism for recruiting participants withdiverse backgrounds and beliefs; and having flexibility in providing anopportunity to exploit new resources in changing situations (Butterfoss etal., 1993; Green et al., 2001). Centers and Institutes Academia engages in service to the community in many ways. One approach to service is through various centers and institutes. For example,in 2002 the University of Washington 's Center for Ecogenetics and Envi- ronmental Health conducted a town meeting to engage in discussions withthe community on racial disparity, poverty, and pollution. Activities broughttogether researchers, legislators, and community members to discuss thehealth risks of pesticides to agricultural workers and their families, con-tamination of seafood by marine toxins and chemical pollutants, hazardouswaste sites, culturally appropriate research strategies, and links betweenindoor and outdoor air pollution and asthma. These discussions led to anumber of projects designed to address community-identified concerns andneeds. The three newly funded CDC Centers for Genomics and Public Health, located at the University of Michigan, University of North Carolina, andUniversity of Washington, are another mechanism through which service tothe community can be provided. Each center will develop a regional hub ofexpertise for the use of genetic information to improve health and preventdisease. In addition to contributing to the knowledge base on genomics andpublic health and providing training for the public health workforce, thecenters are to provide technical assistance to regional, state, and local pub-lic health organizations. \"With this collaborative approach, CDC hopes toCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century 391 . . demonstrate \u2014through real examples \u2014the translation of gene discover- ies into disease prevention and improved health \" (CDC, 2001d). Of primary importance in providing service to the working public health community is the Public Health Leadership Institute. The institute wasdeveloped as a collaborative effort of CDC and the Western Consortiumfor Public Health to provide leadership training for senior public healthofficers in state and local health departments. The University of NorthCarolina now coordinates its efforts. Each year a cohort of senior publichealth officials is selected to participate in a 12-month program that in-cludes self-study, teleconferences, electronic seminars, action-learningprojects, and an intensive on-campus week. The curriculum is centeredaround four modules concerning the challenges to public health: the studyof the future, leadership and vision, communication and information, andpolitical and social change (Scutchfield et al., 1995). The institute hasspawned the development and growth of regional leadership training ef-forts aimed at increasing the leadership skills of public health practitionersat various levels of the system. Other approaches to service include thesummer institutes and courses discussed above in the section Education andTraining. These institutes and courses provide education and training tostate and local health departments and other members of the community. Academia 's contributions to service also can be seen in the work of the Centers for Public Health Preparedness funded by CDC. There are aca-demic centers, specialty centers, and local exemplar centers (see Table 8 -3). Academic centers aim to increase individual preparedness at the front line by linking schools of public health, state and local public health agen-cies, and other academic and community health partners. Specialty centersfocus on a topic, professional discipline, core public health competency,practice setting, or application of learning technology. Local exemplar cen-ters develop advanced applications at the community level in three areas:integrated communications and information systems, advanced operationalreadiness assessment, and comprehensive training and evaluation. Table 8 - 3 lists the centers in existence as of the writing of this report. The centers work in collaboration with partners across their regions to assure a well-trained and prepared public health workforce, informed healthcare providers, and an alert citizenry to protect against terrorism. In Sep-tember 2000, CDC, the Association of Schools of Public Health, state andlocal public health agencies, and other academic communities entered intoa partnership to begin development of a national system of Centers forPublic Health Preparedness (DHHS, 2002). Service learning (also discussed above in the section Education and Training) is another way in which academic institutions engage in commu-nity service. Academic service-learning organizations and activities aregrowing and include the following: (1) service-learning centers on collegeCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Barriers and Solutions There are barriers to establishing successful collaborations and partner- ships. Clark (1999) outlined four barriers or gaps: Communication \u2014a lack of a shared language and emphases; Access \u2014little access to skilled public health faculty by some practi- tioners and communities; Credibility \u2014practitioner skepticism of academic understanding and vice versa; andTABLE 8 -3 Centers for Public Health Preparedness Type Location Academic centers University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, School of Public Health University of Washington School of Public Health and Community Medicine Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health University of Iowa College of Public HealthUniversity of South Florida College of Public Health St. Louis University School of Public Health Specialty centers Dartmouth College Medical School Interactive Media Laboratory Saint Louis University School of Public HealthThe Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Georgetown University Law Center University of Findlay (Ohio) National Center of Excellence for Environmental Management Local exemplar centers DeKalb County Health Department Denver Public Health Monroe County Health Department XXCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Other investigators include as barriers perceived threats to a sense of autonomy, disagreement about community needs, conflicts over fundingdecisions, a lack of consensus about membership criteria or coalition struc-ture, failure to include relevant constituencies, and a lack of leadership(Feighery and Rogers, 1990; Kreuter et al., 2000). A continuing barrier to scholarly service and one of great concern relates to faculty rewards, promotion, and tenure. Public health practiceactivities are not generally valued or rewarded by most academic institu-tions. Israel and colleagues (2001) write that multiple means are needed toprovide evidence and recognition of the scholarship of public health prac-tice. They list a number of matters that must be addressed to overcome thisbarrier. For example, peer-reviewed journals must recognize difficult meth-odological issues associated with conducting community-based participa-tory research and should be willing to publish such articles. Universitiesneed to expand their evaluation of reputable journals. Because faculty mem-bers may assist communities in preparing grant proposals, these activitiesshould be recognized and valued by academic institutions. Similarly, train-ing activities for and technical assistance to community partners should begiven credit toward tenure and promotion. Practice Scholarship Efforts are in progress to overcome the institutional lack of recognition of public health practice and service as scholarly endeavors. Maurana andcolleagues (2000) report on two evidence-based models for documentingand assessing community scholarship activities. The first model, the Pointsof Distinction Project, is part of the Outreach Committee of Michigan StateUniversity. This model identified quantitative and qualitative indicators ofsuccess for four dimensions of quality outreach. The service must havesignificance, in that the issues addressed are of importance and value toproject goals. The context of the service is crucial, in that it should have aclose fit with the environment, use appropriate expertise and methods, havea substantial degree of collaboration, and use resources sufficiently andcreatively. The scholarship of the service should demonstrate appropriateapplication, generation, and use of knowledge. Lastly, the service should beable to demonstrate that it has influence on issues, institutions, and indi-viduals. The second model is the Competency-Based Model of Alverno College in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This model divides scholarly activity into fourcompetencies, each of which specifies skills, activities, and requirementsCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html394 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH that faculty must master for promotion. These skills include being able to teach effectively, work responsibly in the college community, develop andpursue a research agenda, and serve the wider community. The model proposed by Maurana and colleagues (2000) defines com- munity scholarship as \"the products that result from active, systematic engagement of academics with communities for such purposes as address-ing a community-identified need, studying community problems and issues,and engaging in the development of programs that improve health. \" They offer standards and criteria for assessment of this scholarship. Criteriaevaluate goals, preparation, methods, results presentation, and reflectivecritique. The model also describes four types of community scholarshipproducts: 1. Resources, such as how-to manuals, technical assistance, and tools and strategies to assess community strengths and assets or concerns; 2. Program outcomes, such as improved community health outcomes, increased community leadership and funding for health, and integration ofstudents and residents into community-based efforts or creative education; 3. Dissemination, such as presentations, journal articles, and leader- ship at the national, state, and community levels; and 4. Other products, such as new or strengthened partnerships and coa- litions and program development grants. In Demonstrating Excellence, ASPH (1999: 9) discusses the issue of service as scholarship: Service is relevant as scholarship if it requires the use of professional knowledge, or general knowledge that results from one 's role as a faculty member. This knowledge is applied as consultant, professional expert, or technical advisor to the university community, the public health practice community, or professional practice organizations. The dimension ofscholarship distinguishes practice-based service from a form of service known traditionally as the general responsibilities of citizenship. To meet the requirements of scholarship as defined by ASPH, academic service must be provided through community-based participatory research,service learning or the work of the Prevention Research Centers, Centersfor Genomics and Public Health, and Centers for Public Health Prepared-ness. Such activities to improve the health of the community not only fulfillsacademia 's obligation of service but also expands the knowledge base and contributes to improvements in the health of the public. The value of thesecontributions is great and should be acknowledged by academic institutionsin their promotion and tenure policies.

CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS Academia, as one component of the public health system, provides important contributions to the health of the public in three ways: educatingand training public health workers; conducting research in disciplines perti-nent to public health; and engaging in community, public, and professionalservice. Numerous activities have been undertaken to educate and train thecurrent and future public health workforce through methods such as class-room-based instruction, distance-learning programs, and training and lead-ership institutes. Stagnant and shrinking resources allocated to public healthtraining are, however, impeding the ability of academic institutions to ad-dress today 's new and emerging health problems. If it is true that the public health workforce is at the heart of the nation 's ability to respond to new challenges such as emerging infections and preparedness against terroristattacks, then that public health workforce must be adequately educated andtrained to successfully face those challenges. This cannot be accomplishedwithout making the training and education of public health workers thenumber one priority as demonstrated through adequate funding. Academia has made major contributions to prolonging life and increas- ing the quality of life through research. Basic research has provided theknowledge necessary to develop precious vaccines that protect against de-bilitating and deadly diseases, whereas research on the determinants ofhealth has demonstrated the importance of social and behavioral factors tohealth. However, comparatively few resources have been devoted to sup-porting prevention research, community-based research, or the translationof research findings into practice. Such resources must be found and allo-cated if academia is to continue to have a major impact on the health ofcommunities. With the collaboration and partnership of academia, schol-arly service has the potential to make great strides in engaging the commu-nity in improving its own health. However, without a restructuring of thereward system within universities and colleges, this most promising ap-proach to change encounters barriers that are difficult to surmount. Improvement of the public 's health faces great challenges. Academia is committed to working in partnership with other components of the publichealth system to meet these challenges. Yet, to be successful, the role ofacademia must be valued, and funding must be available to develop theprograms and approaches needed for education and training, research, andservice to improve the public 's health.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Three examples are provided below. The MAPP Model The MAPP (Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnership) tool was developed by the National Association of County and City HealthOfficials (NACCHO) in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Controland Prevention (CDC). MAPP (see Figure B -1) was built on the foundation of the Assessment Protocol for Excellence in Health, or APEXPH. APEXPHwas developed as a tool to guide local health officials in conducting assess-ment and planning (NACCHO and CDC, 2000). The MAPP work groupvision is \"Communities achieving improved health and quality of life by mobilizing partnerships and taking strategic action. \" MAPP is targeted to communities, and its goal is to equip them with a structured framework forplanning health programs. The MAPP process is centered on communityorganizing and partnership development and includes four assessments:assessing community themes and strengths, assessing the local public healthsystem, assessing the community 's health status, and assessing the forces of change. Next, MAPP involves the identification of strategic issues, the for-mulation of goals and strategies, and a continuous cycle of planning, imple-mentation, and evaluation.B Models for Collaborative Planning in CommunitiesCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

PATCH was created forapplication among diverse partners at the local level, but also within thecontext of vertical collaboration within the governmental public healthinfrastructure (federal, state, and local levels) and horizontal collaborationswith voluntary organizations, academia, and other partners at all levels(Kreuter, 1992; CDC, 1997; Green et al., 2001). PATCH has five criticalelements or phases (see Figure B -2). These include (1) community member participation, (2) data-based program development, (3) collaborative devel-opment of a comprehensive health promotion strategy, (4) evaluation forfeedback and improvement, and (5) the enhancement of community capac-Community Themes and Strength Assessment Community Health and Status AssessmentForces of Change AssessmentLocal Public Health System AssessmentOrganize for Success Visioning Four MAPP Assessments Identify Strategic Issues Formulate Goals and StrategiesPartnership Development Evaluate Plan Action Implement FIGURE B -1 The MAPP (Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partner- ships) model.SOURCE: NACCHO and CDC (2000).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

In a survey conducted by NACCHO between 1992 and 1993, 239 local health agencies were using PATCH (NACCHOand CDC, 1995). Although PATCH encourages the active engagement oflocal governmental health agencies, it recognizes that these may not alwaysbe the \"most appropriate and/or effective focal point for PATCH \" and \"primary care clinics, university groups, businesses, and other nongovern- mental organizations may be in a better position to exercise leadership fora PATCH program \" with the support and facilitation of the local health agency (Kreuter, 1992). The implementation of PATCH highlighted severalelements that seem to be associated with successful community-based pub-lic health planning and action. These include the existence of a core ofcommunity support and participation, data collection and analysis, settingof objectives and standards to help with planning and evaluation, the adop-tion of multiple strategies on multiple fronts, sustained monitoring andprogress evaluation to fine-tune projects, and the support of the govern-mental public health infrastructure nationally and locally (Kreuter, 1992).One of the major applications of PATCH is carrying out the assessmentfunction of public health, described in the 1988 IOM report (IOM, 1988).Assessment is a core function of the public health infrastructure, but publichealth activities in the private sector and the efforts of communities can alsocontribute to the process of assessing population health status.2 Collecting and organizing data1 Mobilizing the community 3 Choosing health priorities 4 Developing a comprehensive intervention plan5 Evaluating PATCH FIGURE B -2 The PATCH (Planned Approach to Community Health) model.

CHIP (Figure B -3) has two interacting cycles: the problem identification and prioritization cycle, which includes phases ofcommunity organizing, assessment, and selection of priority areas, and theanalysis and implementation cycle, which includes seven phases that rangefrom planning, through implementation, to evaluation (IOM, 1997).

CHIPalso uses the performance measurements provided by Healthy People 2000 (USPHS, 1991) and Healthy Communities 2000 Model Standards (IOM,1997; APHA, 1999). CHIP 's process of developing indicators has been further elaborated in CDC 's Principles of Community Engagement and incorporated in a wide range of community and regional health reportcards (CDC, 1997).

All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html412 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC'S HEALTH Assessment The committee recommends that every public health agency regu- larly and systematically collect, assemble, analyze, and make available in-formation on the health of the community, including statistics on healthstatus, community health needs, and epidemiologic and other studies ofhealth problems. Policy Development The committee recommends that every public health agency exer- cise its responsibility to serve the public interest in the development ofcomprehensive public health policies by promoting use of the scientificknowledge base in decision making about public health and by leading indeveloping public health policy. Agencies must take a strategic approach,developed on the basis of a positive appreciation for the democratic politi-cal process. Assurance The committee recommends that public health agencies assure their constituents that services necessary to achieve agreed upon goals are pro-vided, either by encouraging action or by other entities (private or publicsector), by requiring such action through regulation, or by providing ser-vices directly. The committee recommends that each public health agency involve key policymakers and the general public in determining a set of high-priority personal and communitywide health services that governments willguarantee to every member of the community. This guarantee should in-clude subsidization or direct provision of high-priority personal health ser-vices for those unable to afford them. Levels of Responsiblity States The committee believes that the states are and must be the central force in public health, They bear primary public sector responsibility for health. The committee recommends that the public health duties of states should include the following: Assessment of health needs within the state based on statewide data collection;Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Federal The committee recommends the following as federal public health obli- gations: Support of knowledge development and dissemination through data gathering, research, and information exchange; Establishment of nationwide health objectives and priorities, and stimulation of debate on interstate and national public health issues; Provision of technical assistance to help states and localities deter- mine their objectives and to carry out action on national and regionalobjectives; Provision of funds to states to strengthen state capacity for services, especially to achieve an adequate minimum capacity, and to achieve na-tional objectives; and Assurance of actions and services that are in the public interest of the entire nation such as control of AIDS and similar communicable dis-eases, interstate environmental actions, and food and drug inspections. Localities The committee recommends the following functions for local public health units: Assessment, monitoring, and surveillance of local health problems and needs and of resources for dealing with them; Policy development and leadership that foster local involvement and a sense of ownership, that emphasize local needs, and that advocateCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html414 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH equitable distribution of public resources and complimentary private activi- ties commensurate with community needs; and Assurance that high-quality services, including personal health ser- vices, needed for the protection of public health in the community areavailable and accessible to all persons; that the community receives properconsideration in the allocation of federal and state as well as local resourcesfor public health; and that the community is informed about how to obtainpublic health, including personal health, services, or how to comply withpublic health requirements. FULFILLING THE GOVERNMENT ROLE: IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS Statutory Base The committee recommends that states review their public health stat- utes and make the revisions necessary to accomplish the following twoobjectives: Clearly delineate the basic authority and responsibility entrusted to public health agencies, boards, and officials at the state and local levels andthe relationships between them; and Support a set of modern disease control measures that address contemporary health problems such as AIDS, cancer, and heart disease, andincorporate due process safeguards (notice, hearings, administrative re-view, right to counsel, standards of evidence). Structural/Organizational Steps States The committee recommends that each state have a department of health that groups all primarily health-related functions under professionaldirection \u2014separate from income maintenance. Responsibilities of this de- partment should include disease prevention and health promotion, Medic-aid and other indigent health care activities, mental health and substanceabuse, environmental responsibilities that clearly require health expertise,and health planning and regulation of health facilities and professions. The committee recommends that each state have a state health council that reports regularly on the health of the state 's residents, makes health policy recommendations to the governor and legislative [branch],promulgates public health regulations, reviews the work of the state healthdepartment, and recommends candidates for director of the department.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlAPPENDIX C 415 The committee recommends that the director of the department of health be a cabinet (or equivalent-level) officer. Ideally, the director shouldhave doctoral-level education as a physician or in another health profes-sion, as well as education in public health itself and extensive public-sectoradministrative experience. Provisions for tenure in office, such as a specificterm of appointment, should promote needed continuity of professionalleadership. The committee recommends that each state establish standards for local public health functions, specifying what minimum services must beoffered, by what unit of government, and how services are to be financed.States (unless providing local services directly) should hold localities ac-countable for these services and for addressing statewide health objectives. Localities The committee finds that the larger the population served by a single multipurpose government, as well as the stronger the history of localcontrol, the more realistic the delegation of responsibility becomes: forexample, to a large metropolitan city, county, or service district. Two at-tributes of such a locally responsible system are strongly recommended: \u2014To promote clear accountability, public health responsibility should be delegated to only one unit of government in a locality. \u2014Where sparse population or scarce resources prevail, delega- tion to regional single-purpose units, such as multicounty healthdistricts, may be appropriate. The committee recommends that mechanisms be instituted to pro- mote local accountability and assure the maintenance of adequate andequitable levels of service and qualified personnel. The committee finds that the need for a clear focal point at the local level is as great as at the state level, and for the same reasons. Wherethe scale of government activity permits, localities should establish publichealth councils to report to elected officials on local health needs and on theperformance of the local health agency. Federal The committee recommends that the federal government identify more clearly, in formal structure and actual practice, the specific officialsand agencies with primary responsibility for carrying out the federal publichealth functions recommended earlier. The committee recommends the establishment of a task force to consider what structure or programmatic changes would be desirable toCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Special Linkages Environmental Health The committee recommends that state and local health agencies strengthen their capacities for identification, understanding, and control ofenvironmental problems as health hazards. The agencies cannot simply beadvocates for the health aspects of environmental issues, but must havedirect operational involvement. Mental Health The committee recommends that those engaged in knowledge de- velopment and policy planning in public health and in mental health, re-spectively, devote a specific effort to strengthening linkages with the otherfield, particularly in order to identify strategies to integrate these functionsat the service delivery level. The committee recommends that a study of the public health/men- tal health interface be done in order to document how the lack of linkageswith public health hampers the mental health mission. Social Services The committee recommends that public health be separated orga- nizationally from income maintenance, but that public health agencies main-tain close working relationships with social service agencies in order to actas effective advocates for, and to cooperate with, social service agencyprovision of social services that have an impact on health. Care of the Indigent The committee endorses the conclusion of the President 's Commis- sion for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medical Care and Biomedical andBehavioral Research that the ultimate responsibility for assuring equitableaccess to health care for all, through a combination of public- and private-sector action, rests with the federal government. The committee finds that, until adequate federal action is forth- coming, public health agencies must continue to serve, with quality andrespect and to the best of their ability, the priority personal health careneeds of uninsured, underinsured, and Medicaid clients.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlAPPENDIX B 417 Strategies for Capacity Building Technical The uniform national data set should be established that will per- mit valid comparison of local and state health data with those of the nationand of other states and localities and that will facilitate progress towardnational health objectives and implementation. There should be an institutional home in each state and at the federal level for development and dissemination of knowledge, includingresearch and the provision of technical assistance to lower levels of govern-ment and to the academic institution and voluntary organizations. Research should be conducted at the federal, state, and local levels into population-based health problems, including biological, environmen-tal, and behavioral issues. In addition to conducting research directly, thefederal government should support research by states, localities, universi-ties, and the private sector. Political Public health agency leaders should develop relationships with and educate legislators and other public officials on community health needs,on public health issues, and the rationale for strategies advocated andpursued by the health department. These relationships should be cultivatedon an ongoing basis rather than being neglected until a crisis develops. Agencies should strengthen the competence of agency personnel in community relations and citizen participation techniques and develop pro-cedures to build citizen participation into program implementation. Agencies should develop and cultivate relationships with physi- cians and other private-sector representatives. Physicians and other healthprofessionals are important instruments of public health by virtue of suchactivities as counseling patients on health promotion and providing immu-nizations. They are important determinants of public attitudes and of theimage of the public health. Public health leaders should take the initiative toseek working relationships and support among local, state, and nationalmedical and other professional societies and academic medical centers. Agencies should seek stronger relationships and common cause with other professional and citizen groups pursuing interests with healthimplications, including voluntary health organizations, groups concernedwith improving social services or environment, and groups concerned witheconomic development. Agencies should undertake education of the public on community health needs and public health policy issues.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html418 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH Agencies should review the quality of \"street-level \" contacts be- tween department employees and clients and where necessary conduct in-service training to ensure that members of the public are treated withcordiality and respect. Managerial Greater emphasis in public health curricula should be placed on managerial and leadership skills, such as the ability to communicate impor-tant agency values to employees and enlist their commitment; to sense anddeal with important changes in the environment; to plan, mobilize, and useresources effectively; and to relate the operation of the agency to its largercommunity role. Demonstrated management competence as well as technical/pro- fessional skills should be a requirement for upper-level management posts. Salaries and benefits should be improved for health department managers, especially health officers, and systems should be instituted sothat they can carry retirement benefits with them when they move amongdifferent levels of jurisdictions of government. Programmatic The committee recommends that public health professionals place more emphasis on factors that influence health-related behavior and de-velop comprehensive strategies that take these factors into account. Fiscal The committee recommends the following policies with respect to in- tergovernmental strategies for strengthening the fiscal base of public health: Federal support of state-level health programs should help balance disparities in revenue-generating capacities and encourage state attention tonational health objectives. Particular vehicles for such support should in-clude \"core\" funding with appropriate accountability mechanisms, as well as funds targeted for specific uses. State support of local-level health services should balance local revenue-generating disparity, establish local capacity to provide minimumlevels of service, and encourage local attention to state health objectives;support should include \"core\" funding. State funds could be furnished with strings attached and sanctions available for noncompliance, and/or generalsupport could be provided with appropriate accountability requirementsCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlAPPENDIX C 419 built in. States have the obligation in either case to monitor local use of state funds. Education for Public Health Schools of public health should establish firm practice links with state and/or local public health agencies so that significantly more facultymembers may undertake professional responsibilities in these agencies, con-duct research there, and train students in such practice situations. Recruit-ment of faculty and admission of students should give appropriate weightto prior public health experience as well as to academic qualifications. Schools of public health should fulfill their potential role as signifi- cant resources to government at all levels in the development of publichealth policy. Schools of public health should provide students an opportunity to learn the entire scope of public health practice, including environmental,educational, and personal health approaches to the solution of public healthproblems; the basic epidemiological and biostatistical techniques for analy-sis of those problems; and the political and management skills needed forleadership in public health. Research in schools of public health should range from basic re- search in fields related to public health, through applied research and devel-opment, to program evaluation and implementation research. Schools of public health should take maximum advantage of train- ing resources in their universities, for example, faculty and courses in schoolsof business administration, and departments of physical, biological, andsocial sciences. Schools of public health should extend their expertise to advise and assist with the health content of the educational programs of other schoolsand departments of the university. Schools of public health should undertake an expanded program of short courses to help upgrade the competence of these personnel. In addi-tion, short course offering should provide opportunities for previouslytrained public health professionals, especially health officers, to keep upwith advances in knowledge and practice. Schools of public health should encourage and assist other institu- tions to prepare appropriate, qualified public health personnel for positionsin the field. When educational institutions other than schools of publichealth undertake to train personnel for work in the field, careful attentionto the scope and capacity of the educational program is essential. Schools of public health should strengthen their response to the needs for qualified personnel for important, but often neglected aspects ofpublic health such as the health of minority groups and international health.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html420 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH Schools of public health should help develop, or offer directly in their own universities, effective courses that expose undergraduates to con-cepts, history, current context, and techniques of public health to assist inthe recruitment of able future leaders into the field.

Purpose The competency sets are intended to be a resource for persons inter- ested in public health workforce development. It includes online sources forall documents listed. The information listed can be used as an aid tocurriculum developers and instructional designers in planning training pro-grams for the Nation's public health workers. This resource document alsoprovides relevant examples of competency statements from other occupa-tions and professions that share in the work of public health. Used as astarting point, this list may help avoid duplication of efforts and will buildon existing activities across the U.S. Methodology This report on competency sets was developed using print and elec- tronic references and experts in workforce development.

The Competency Sets The competency sets can be grouped and differentiated several ways: Core: Basic Public Health Skills (skills needed to perform the essen- tial functions of public health) Function-specific: e.g., leadership, management, supervisory, sup- port staff Discipline-specific: e.g., community dentistry for public health den- tists, other professionals or technical specialists Subject-specific (within a discipline): maternal and child health, STD, vaccine preventable diseases, cancer, other chronic diseases Workplace basics: required of all personnel and includes literacy, writing and presentation skills and computer literacy Limitations The competencies listed are those known at the time of printing. The comprehensive search for related public health worker competencies includednumerous global and site-specific web searches, list-serve queries, and per-sonal contacts. Since the field of workforce development is evolving, manycompetency sets \u2014be they produced by government, academic institutions, public health and professional organizations \u2014are in development.

All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html444 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH BALTIMORE SITE VISIT JULY 2001 About the Vision for Health Consortium The Sandtown-Winchester community of Baltimore, Maryland, is a largely African-American, 72-block urban community of 10,500 peoplethat has experienced significant rates of substance abuse, unemployment,and other problems. The Vision for Health (VFH) Consortium emergedfrom a \"comprehensive neighborhood transformation program \" begun in 1990 by the Community Building in Partnership, Inc., a partnership amongSandtown-Winchester residents, the mayor, and the city government, withfunding from the Enterprise Foundation and a neighborhood block grantfrom the city. At the end of a 2-year process of planning, assessing, anddiscussing community needs, health (particularly substance abuse issues,children 's health, chronic disease, HIV/AIDS, and homicide) emerged as an area of high community priority, second only to education. VFH 's founding partners include Community Building in Partnership, Inc., which is the organizational representative for the citizenry ofSandtown-Winchester, as well as the Baltimore City Health Department,the Bon Secours Baltimore Health System, the Enterprise Foundation, TotalHealth Care, the University of Maryland Medical System, and the Univer-sity of Maryland School of Nursing. In addition to these formal partners,VFH has informal partners, such as the Baltimore Times , a local newspaper that has been a supporter and facilitator of the community health improve-ment initiative from the beginning. Previously, several of these partners hadbeen competitors, providing health care services within the same territory.Coming together, they agreed to collaborate in the creation of an integratedsystem of care that would reach out to uninsured or underinsured individu-als and respond to the community 's need for health improvement. These partners signed a community compact at the beginning of their collabora-tion, agreeing upon basic principles for their work together. For example,the compact outlined goals and objectives, agreements for financial andadministrative collaboration and accountability, and most importantly, re-flected commitment to addressing the needs of the community. In 1998, VFH received funding from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation as part of a national initiative at 13 sites, called Community Voices: HealthCare for the Underserved. The Community Voices project administered byVFH mainly targets Sandtown-Winchester and some Baltimore residents \u2014 including recently released ex-offenders \u2014least likely to be reached by other social services programs. VFH help to maintain its accountability to the community by employ- ing a resident advisor \u2014a community resident who serves as a liaison toCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

VFH's Mission, Values/Principles, and Goals VFH 's mission is \"to work with the neighborhood transformation ef- forts of Community Building in Partnership, Inc., to create a community-driven health system in Sandtown-Winchester with the goal of improvingthe community 's overall health status. This will be accomplished by pro- moting early intervention, prevention, and access to quality health careregardless of ability to pay \" (VFH, 1997: 9). The project 's values and principles include a focus on quality and ser- vice excellence, on being community driven, having respect and compassionfor the community, assuring relationships of integrity between and amongpartner institutions, and promoting innovation as an integral part of thecommunity transformation process. The goals of the Community Building in Partnership, Inc., initiative were to transform a range of community systems that seemed inadequate orineffective in addressing major community problems such as unemploy-ment, crime, and poor housing. This wide-ranging perspective on commu-nity well-being appears to have formed the foundation of the VFHConsortium 's profound understanding of how social and environmental factors can affect health outcomes and the importance of the individual 's and the community 's roles in improving health. Based on priorities identi- fied by the community, the VFH Consortium describes five goals: (1) adultprimary care and health promotion, (2) community outreach, (3) school-based children 's health services, (4) substance abuse treatment, and (5) violence prevention. VFH Activities and Accomplishments In keeping with the spirit of the Community Voices, the residents of the Sandtown-Winchester community have always been an integral part of theVFH Consortium and the process of transforming the health and humanservices systems in the area. Approximately 500 residents were active in theinitial planning process, with community members participating on plan-ning work groups and identifying top neighborhood health priorities. Inaddition to the resident advisor to the VFH Consortium, several commu-nity members work as outreach workers in the community, linking peopleto needed health promotion and health care services. VFH and its partnerscontinue to conduct community forums and gatherings, where residentsengage with administrators and providers in dialogue about thecommunity 's health, its needs, and its accomplishments.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html446 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH The activities of VFH involve no overhead costs, because consortium members take turns providing administrative and other resources. VFHstaff members are employees of Bon Secours health system, whereas Men 's Health Clinic staff are city health department employees. The EnterpriseFoundation takes the lead financial role by receiving funding and reimburs-ing consortium members as appropriate. For instance, the comprehensiveservices provided by the neighborhood 's elementary school health centers (fine-tuned through meetings between school principals and VFH staff) area direct response to the community 's expressed needs for child health care that is more than just \"Band-Aids and shots. \" The University of Maryland School of Nursing manages the school-based clinics that provide compre-hensive preventive primary health care as well as mental and oral healthcare services. Asthma management and mental health services are some ofthe extras available in school-based clinics. Baltimore Health Departmentfunds for school health centers go to the Enterprise Foundation, which thenreimburses the School of Nursing for services rendered. In other areas,partner agencies donate or otherwise contribute certain services to helpsupport the continuum of care envisioned by the collaborative and thecommunity. For instance, men with substance abuse or mental health needswho receive services at the Men 's Health Clinic (discussed below) are re- ferred to Bon Secours for follow-up care or to the University of Marylandmedical system for psychiatric urgent care. Research and evaluation are relatively new areas for the VFH Consor- tium. They received assistance with needs assessment surveys from theBaltimore Health Department and some evaluation support from a localuniversity. In June 2000, VFH opened the Men 's Health Center, the first compo- nent of an integrated health care delivery system for uninsured men. Theneed for a men 's health care center was identified through community assessments which showed that many women in need of health care lackeda medical home, but had some access to the health care safety net throughfamily planning and prenatal (Healthy Start) services. Men, however, hadmuch less access. This problem was compounded by the men 's reported feelings of discomfort with clinical settings that seemed primarily attunedto women 's health care needs and their concerns about not being able to take care of their own health, let alone their families ' health. Acknowledg- ing these issues, as well as the important roles men can play in maintaininghealthy families and neighborhoods, VFH sought to use the Men 's Health Center as a way of both providing care and \"building families . . . one man at a time. \" The Men 's Health Center currently provides quality primary health care, as well as referrals to substance abuse services and dental care.Through the social workers and community outreach workers on staff, mencan also access job training and social services, participate in weekly sup-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Additionally, there are plans to develop similar comprehensive, high-quality health care ser-vices to uninsured women. Other VFH plans include expanding the activi-ties of Women Against Violence, a community group that is currentlyexploring the various effects of neighborhood violence on the family struc-ture and considering future opportunities to partner with churches andorganizations on issues related to fatherhood. VFH 's outreach component involves creating bridges between commu- nity residents and local agencies and services. Outreach is essential to con-necting people who mistrust government programs or systems to the ser-vices they badly need. The project employs two types of outreach workers:VFH workers, who conduct general community outreach and educationabout access to services and related matters, and Men 's Clinic workers, who perform the dedicated role of linking uninsured men to health careservices, following up with them when needed and referring them to otherhuman services. In addition to activities specific to the Sandtown-Winchester neighbor- hood, VFH has been a partner in broader community health improvementefforts. For instance, VFH has participated in and contributed funding forthe Maryland Citizen 's Health Initiative, a statewide grassroots effort work- ing to attain universal health coverage. VFH has also been involved inPhases I and II of the National Community Care Network Program, whichis part of the Maryland Health Improvement Plan 2000 -2010. VFH is also a charter sponsor of the Maryland Citizens Health Initiative EducationFund (MCHIEF), which operates under the banner of \"Health Care for All.\" VFH has further played a convening role, holding a large symposium for outreach workers and emphasizing the importance of outreach (a statebill passed in recent years mandates an outreach component as part of allmanaged care organizations). As a result of VFH 's efforts, the rate of childhood immunization, which was about 68 percent in 1994, increased to 100 percent and has remainedat that level for several years. Site Visit Discussion In July 2001, representatives of the Institute of Medicine Committee on Assuring the Health of the Public in the 21st Century engaged in a daylongdialogue with staff and partners from VFH. VFH approaches community health improvement primarily from a health care emphasis. More specifically, the consensus among communityand institutional partners holds that health care is an essential determinantto good individual and community health, and the fact that many people inthe community lack access to adequate and high-quality care affects theirCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The consortium appears to include substantial community input, from assessment to planning to implementation. VFH staff members, many ofwhom are themselves residents of the Sandtown-Winchester community,reported that members of the community feel that they own the initiativeand that they have a part in what gets accomplished. However, this rela-tionship between the \"public \" and the public health enterprise is fraught with complexity, and VFH partners described some of the challenges theyexperienced in thinking about and addressing it. The Men 's Health Center is clearly a product of collaboration between the local public health agencyand health care expertise and resources, on the one hand, and communitymembers ' cultural knowledge and social experiences, on the other. On an organizational level, the Men 's Health Center is located in a health depart- ment facility, yet it is a separate entity. However, there were initial concernson the part of community clinics that perceived the center as a sign that thehealth department was overstepping its bounds and expanding its provisionof direct services. VFH partners noted that the role of the health depart-ment is to facilitate, support, bring resources to the table, and look at thecommunity in a way that affirms assets, motivation and power for changerather than focusing on the \"empty half of the glass, \" that is, needs and deficiencies. The local newspaper has been a noteworthy informal partner to Sandtown-Winchester 's health improvement efforts. The newspaper is a trusted and respected source of information in the neighborhood, and itwas able to successfully organize and publicize community health eventssuch as an annual health walk, a mall-based health fair, and events target-ing both women 's and men 's health issues. In addition to creating several forums for community education (including educating local ministers onhealth issues) and a gateway for people 's management of their own health, the paper also provides regular health education messages, including specialhealth publications. The Baltimore Times has also formed a new alliance with the health department. In the past, the newspaper 's leadership, com- mitted to community empowerment and education, felt compelled to act asa community advocate in light of what it perceived as the healthdepartment 's insufficient regard for the community 's awareness of its own health needs as well as its assets and resources. Over time and throughongoing dialogue, the relationship between the newspaper and the healthdepartment has become one of mutual support \u2014the health department even provides copy to the newspaper. As different community needs have been identified, new opportunitiesCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlAPPENDIX F 449 for partnership have emerged. For example, the correctional system is often the only link to primary care for adult men who had not previously quali-fied for or accessed other health care and social services. The VFH Consor-tium recently started a collaboration with the local police department tohelp newly released former inmates returning to their community make thelinks to care that may include sexually transmitted disease/HIV preventionand treatment, substance abuse treatment, counseling, and mental healthcare services.

DENVER SITE VISIT NOVEMBER 2001 About Denver Health and Its Community Voices Project Denver Health is both a nonprofit health care system that integrates safety net services and a public-private public health enterprise. DenverHealth received funding from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation to establish aCommunity Voices: Healthcare for the Underserved community outreachprogram in 1998. Denver Health has five goals that provide for a uniqueintegration of personal health care and public health services and \"take care of the special needs of all populations and the needs of special populations \" (Gabow, 2001). These goals include: Provide access to quality preventive, acute, and chronic health care for all citizens in Denver regardless of ability to pay. Provide expert emergency medical services to Denver and the Rocky Mountain. Fulfill public health functions as dictated by the charter and the needs of citizens. Conduct health education of patients and education of health care professionals. Conduct research that addresses patient needs as well as the educa- tional needs of health care professionals in training. The position of Denver Health in the local public health system is unique. The organization performs some of the functions of a governmentalpublic health agency, but others, such as environmental health, are underthe purview of the local county/city government 's Environmental Health agency.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Its main activities include: community outreach to enhanceaccess to health care, provide health education and health promotion ser-vices, and engage communities in health improvement; facilitating enroll-ment to link eligible individuals to publicly sponsored health insuranceprograms; and case management, providing personalized care and servicesto vulnerable patients. In conformity with the initiative name, Denver Health Community Voices involves community perspectives and partners in health improve-ment. The initiative 's community outreach component is guided by a multicultural steering committee and includes community health advisorswho are staff members drawn from the community and community part-ners that include schools, local businesses, organizations, religious congre-gations, and neighborhood groups. Community partners help publicize in-formation about Denver Health and access to health care, and provideopportunities and/or support for community health promotion events. Com-munity health advisors facilitate communication between Denver healthand the community about community needs, and help to reduce the impactof cultural and other barriers to access. The advisors also provide healthpromotion and disease prevention education and some informal counselingand support to individuals and groups in the community. At the state level, Denver Health is involved with the Colorado Coali- tion for the Medically Underserved and Colorado Access, a safety-net healthmaintenance organization and Medicaid managed care entity for the Den-ver area that also includes two local hospitals (one children 's), a physicians ' group, and the network of federally qualified health centers.

The Network is active in a tricounty areathat includes 12 towns in central New Hampshire. CCNTR member agenciesinclude a wide range of local social services organizations (ranging fromshelters, to elder care, drug abuse, and the Women with Infants and ChildrenProgram), a regional hospital, the chamber of commerce, a regional nursingassociation, a mental health service provider, schools, an affordable housingprovider, a visiting nurse association, and a clergy association. The CCNTRboard consists of 24 members; half of the members are community represen-tatives, and the remainder represent different agencies. CCNTR 's Mission, Goals, and Objectives CCNTR has been a participant in the Turning Point Program, which is funded by the W. K. Kellogg and Robert Wood Johnson Foundations, anddirected by the National Association of County and City Health Officialswith assistance from the University of Washington School of Public Health.CCNTR is one of three Turning Point project sites in the state of NewHampshire, but it is somewhat unique compared with the other projects inthe state and projects in other states, as it works on the creation of localpublic health capacity in an area with limited public health staffing andinfrastructure. CCNTR has six main objectives, including: (1) improving access to health and mental health care; (2) establishing programs to lower youthrisk behaviors related to substance abuse and other issues; (3) health pro-motion and disease prevention; (4) community/public health improvement;(5) increasing social capital, engagement in community health, and devel-opment; and (6) supporting the basic needs of individuals and families.There has been some progress in both planning and implementing activitiesin most areas. In 1998, for instance, CCNTR conducted a large-scale com-munity needs assessment that revealed youth risk behaviors as a majorissue, especially because teens do not have many available activities oropportunities for after-school and extracurricular entertainment. As a re-sult, the community and CCNTR developed three strategies for addressingrisk behaviors. The first two, which have already been funded and initiatedin several communities, include school-based prevention curricula and struc-tured after-school (3:00 to 7:00 p.m.) programs. The third strategy, not yetfunded at the time of the site visit, is the alignment of community attitudesCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Public Health Infrastructure: Existing and Needed Capacity As in most states, the public health infrastructure in New Hampshire has experienced certain difficulties. In New Hampshire, these stem fromfragmentation, a lack of coordination between the state and local levels,limited resources, and other factors (Rhein et al., 2001). This means thateffective communication, sharing of information, and the standardizationof functions, services, and roles can be difficult to accomplish. Local publichealth entities function under separate and often dissimilar town ordi-nances. There is one public health laboratory for the entire state, andsurveillance functions are covered by individual hospitals, at least in theTwin Rivers area. Unlike localities where there are health departments, apublic health infrastructure, adequate facilities, and many public healthworkers to help facilitate and support community health improvement ef-forts, the Twin Rivers area does not have an easily visible public healthpresence. There is no official agency building, and the health officers (one ineach town) are mostly semivolunteers who have other full-time jobs (e.g., afirefighter, a plumber, and a city legislator) in addition to their publichealth responsibilities. The services provided across the region are thusfragmented and reactive, as well as lacking in uniformity, because of localdifferences in policies and procedures. The collection of public health infor-mation, such as the collection of data by the state, has been recognized asone of the areas in need of improvement. For example, people at the locallevel have charged that the data collected by the state may skew or entirelymiss the needs of small, heterogeneous local communities. CCNTR used the state Turning Point project grant to assist local health officers in ensuring the three core public health functions are performed,and to join existing public health efforts with community resources toaccomplish more in improving and assuring the health of the population inthe area. CCNTR is working on the development of a public health systemof governance that would help to shape local public health policy, interfacewith the state about policy and service delivery issues, and deliver andassure public health services (such as assessment and surveillance). TheCaring Community Network has been conducting assessment of a range ofbasic health indicators, such as adolescent pregnancy, immunization levels,and school-based administration of Behavioral Risk Factor SurveillanceSystem questionnaires. Furthermore, CCNTR carries out formal and infor-mal community needs assessment activities, identifies local strengths andassets that can be used to respond to the identified needs, and also main-tains a \"big picture \" of state policy and other issues that have impact on theCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlAPPENDIX F 453 local level. CCNTR has also worked with the state to change state policies about data collection (e.g. going beyond county data and collecting data ina way that recognizes the heterogeneity of health data across towns) andmeans for making data available to local levels (e.g., through the Internet).CCNTR 's mission is to work with communities to plan and develop an integrated health and human service delivery system that optimally ad-dresses regional social and health problems, such as an underfunded andfragmented public health system, barriers to accessing services, high-riskbehaviors, and many unmet basic needs (e.g., for shelter, food, and trans-portation). CCNTR embraces a broad and inclusive definition of public health that includes attention to social issues from a low level of community engage-ment in collective development and change to the mental health and thesocial needs of youth. The point, according to a CCNTR partner, is toinclude \"things we all do for work and play \" in order to engage \"as many people as possible in improving community health. \" As a result of a per- spective that is expansive, flexible, and truly interested in the community 's expressed needs, CCNTR supported the community 's first area of priority: the development of a multipurpose trails/greenways system that could pro-vide a place for recreational activities and that could provide a safe andenvironmentally friendly alternative for pedestrian and bike traffic. Beingresponsive to community needs also ensured the interest and involvementof a wide cross-section of community members who felt that they couldrally around an issue critical to them rather than being obliged to accept anissue determined by outside \"experts. \" Other accomplishments of CCNTR have included the redevelopment of the old city hall/opera house in recogni-tion of the economic and social potential of cultural education and theimportance of the arts to nurturing the community and developing creativeand artistic skills in young people. An important dimension of CCNTR 's work has been its consistent emphasis on communicating with and provid-ing feedback to the community. Site Visit Discussion Because of the limited nature of the public health infrastructure of the Twin Rivers area, CCNTR, local health officers, and the community havecreatively assembled a public health system that draws on the locally avail-able public health expertise that is available but also capitalizes on commu-nity resources and skills. The committee heard about the potential implica-tions posed by this specific scenario to national-level attempts to standardizelocal public health infrastructures and credentialing public health workers.Although the Twin Rivers community leaders present at the site visit ex-pressed a clear vision of quality public health services, they expressed someCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html454 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH concern that credentialing and other efforts to formalize local public health services may impair rather than help local work. Although not having a\"real\" health department may be perceived as a problem in some ways, one participant in the site visit stated that they consider themselves \"lucky \" that they have no existing infrastructure to \"undo \" to make it correspond to actual community needs. Workers and community representatives at thesite visit noted that they have a great deal of flexibility and the ability torespond to needs in a manner that is unencumbered by the potential rigidityand resistance to change of more formal, highly bureaucratic structures. CCNTR members further stated that they would prefer something more basic than credentialing to ensure standardization and quality. Having stan-dards for health officers is important, they noted, but a formal credentialmay not be a good idea given their local situation and the already diverseprofessional backgrounds of existing health officers. Site visit participantswould also like to see continuing education available in areas where theinfrastructure is underdeveloped and more focus on Internet-based tools.This highlights the potential of distance education and other emergingtechnologies for the purpose of continuing education and capacity building.Even so, there are some local limitations in terms of technical capacity (e.g.,the low level of availability of T1 or DSL connections to the Internet), aswell as logistical issues, such as the absence of a central office where publichealth officers may check in regularly.

NEW ORLEANS SITE VISIT AUGUST 2001 About Healthy New Orleans The Healthy New Orleans (HNO) Partnership was formed in 1997 and received a Turning Point project grant from the Robert Wood Johnson andW. K. Kellogg Foundations. It is one of three local Turning Point projectpartnerships funded in the state of Louisiana. Like other Turning Pointpartnerships, HNO, formally known as Healthy New Orleans, the City That Cares , emerged to address problems in the public health system that contributed to poor community health outcomes, as well as fragmented andinadequate services. The total grant funding is $20,000 for 3 years. HNO 's diverse membership includes representatives of local community organiza-tions, the state and local health departments, academia, faith-based organi-zations, non-profit health care providers, and community residents of vari-ous ages and of various backgrounds.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlAPPENDIX F 455 In August 2001, representatives of the committee participated in a dialogue with some of the membership of HNO about their objectives,accomplishments, and lessons learned. Healthy New Orleans Vision, Mission, Goals, and Objectives HNO developed its vision in partnership with the community through a consensus-seeking process and in answer to the question \"What will Healthy New Orleans: the City that Cares have in place by 2050? \" The \"shared practical vision \" that emerged is a complex of nine components needed to achieve community wellness. These components were visuallyarranged by the groups as a pyramid with the vision of communitywellness at its heart and with community involvement at its apex. Thecomponents of the vision include state-of-the-art diagnostic approaches,emphasis on prevention, expanded view of public health, an electronicallylinked delivery system, community-based health centers, comprehensiveconsumer information, community-driven (public health) governance, pro-tective public health policy, and varied funding. HNO developed six ob-jectives to be accomplished in three phases: (1) partnership development,(2) assessment of resources and needs, (3) development of a public healthimprovement plan, (4) the availability of communications and informa-tion systems to serve the community, (5) broad ownership by expandingthe vision to nontraditional stakeholders, and (6) accountability in termsof evaluation and feedback to the community. The first phase of HNO 's work, partnership development, was conducted between January 1998and March 1999. This phase included work on establishing and deepen-ing partner relationships and interorganizational linkages and, most im-portantly, on defining a partnership structure and partnership objectivesin a manner congruent with the resources and needs identified by commu-nity members. During the second phase, HNO conducted a strategic planning pro- cess in coordination with the state public health entity, resulting in thedevelopment of a Community Public Health System Improvement Plan(considered a road map to influence health outcomes in New Orleans)that includes a conceptual framework centered around achieving com-munity wellness by transforming public systems, personal health, andhealth systems. The third phase involves implementation of the planningprocess, with particular attention to 17 recommendations for actiondeveloped through community workshops. The recommendations withthe highest priority ratings included establishment of the Center forEmpowered Decision-Making, development of community health net-works, and expansion of the definition of public health to include qual-ity-of-life indicators.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html456 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH Accomplishments of HNO From the beginning of its work to transform the way in which public health is done in New Orleans, HNO used a broad definition of publichealth that encompassed social and environmental issues such as poverty,housing, and green spaces. HNO is further distinguished by its attention tothe human and social elements involved in making partnerships and coali-tions work. Collaborative planning has been the centerpiece of HNO 's activities both in terms of establishing a workable representative coalitionthat \"owns \" the process and the products and in terms of planning commu- nity health improvement in a detailed and strategic way. HNO recognizedthe assets and resources that the community and other partners had tocontribute. However, the group also identified what it termed \"underlying contradictions \" or areas of conflict, such as a lack of community empower- ment, systemic resistance to change, and other barriers to progress (HealthyNew Orleans Partnership, 2001). \"The community means everyone, \" stated one participant during the site visit, and others commented on the need toend the separation between \"public \" and \"health \" in public health. Fur- thermore, when discussing where the public health enterprise begins andends, HNO partners emphasized that public health agencies are part of thecommunity and should act as \"amoebas, \" adapting to circumstances, being responsive to community needs, and focusing on the psychosocioeconomicdeterminants of health. Participants also acknowledged a prevalent miscon-ception about public health as being \"for the poor \" and suggested that public health be equated to community wellness. Subsequently, they noted,public health funding must be aligned with community definitions andneeds rather than categorically linked to a predetermined framework. Whenasked about the role of public health departments, HNO participants re-marked on the unique position of public health practitioners as keepers andcommunicators of data and people who \"get\" the holistic view of health, unlike some providers and funders. HNO has had some influence on its partners, for instance, helping to facilitate changes in state-level data collection and reporting to increase itsusefulness and accessibility to the local level. HNO has also taken steps toimplement several of the recommendations that emerged from the commu-nity health improvement planning process. For instance, three of eight NewOrleans neighborhoods, Carollton, Bienville/Tulane, and St. Bernard/Gentilly, have received small HNO grants to conduct some collaborativeplanning activities in their communities. Their visions and goals focused onspecifics such as creating a multipurpose community center, improving anddeveloping neighborhoods, and addressing violent crime. A fourth neigh-borhood is beginning its own process of grassroots collaborative planning. HNO has been involved in a slow, thoughtful process of facilitatingCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

There was also agreement that public health education shouldchange to fit the times (that is, there is a need for outreach and community-based public health) and should be extended to the private sector, healthcare providers, and others. Some attendees expressed concerns about thelimitations on funding that addresses the root causes of health problems(e.g., determinants of health), as well as frustration with the dichotomybetween community knowledge and scientific expertise. Although HNOparticipants articulated a desire to evaluate their work in a scientificallyvalid way, a question lingered: \"What will it take before communities can be heard without first having to get the Ivory Tower Seal of Approval? \" It is apparent that the community members and organizations involved in HNO have become profoundly engaged in the process of collaborativeplanning and have begun to achieve objectives on their way to transformingthe local public health system. Further efforts to research and evaluatecommunity-level outcomes will help guide the initiative. The ultimatesustainability of the process, although a stated goal of the grant and fore-most in the minds of the facilitators of the project, is not clear at this time.

OAKLAND SITE VISIT OCTOBER 2001 About Asian Health Services and La Clinica de la Raza The committee visited the Oakland Community Voices for Immigrant Health project site in October 2001. The Community Voices project in thecity of Oakland, California, is administered by the Asian Health Servicesand La Clinica de la Raza, two multisite, nonprofit, community-based,federally funded clinics in Oakland. The partnership among these two healthcare services providers, the Alameda County Health Department, and othercommunity organizations like the Alameda Health Consortium has beenfruitful and effective in addressing several of the complex and interrelatedissues facing area communities, ranging from a lack of health insurance totobacco use among minority, disadvantaged populations. Both La Clinica and Asian Health Services have an impressive history of community engagement. La Clinica de la Raza was founded in 1971 bya group of students, health professionals, and community activists and wasorganized under a board consisting of patients, community members, andprofessionals elected in annual elections. La Clinica employs approximately350 staff at four locations in Alameda County and at a medical and dentalCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html458 THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH clinic in a neighboring county. The services provided include primary medi- cal care; dental, mental, and eye care; inpatient care.Asian Health Services has been serving the community since 1974 at threelocations and with 120 staff. Its services include clinical services like mater-nal and child health; HIV testing, counseling, and care; adolescent, adult,and elderly care; and urgent care. It provides health education services ontopics ranging from family planning to disease prevention (cancer and HIV/AIDS) and women 's health. Mission, Values/Principles, and Goals of the Oakland Community Voices Project In 1998, Oakland became 1 of 13 sites in the nation funded by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation 's Community Voices initiative to address the prob- lem of uninsurance in local communities. The Community Voices projecthas been advocating on behalf of Alameda County 's 130,000 to 140,000 uninsured individuals and aiming to develop policy, organize the commu-nity to support policy change, inform the community about access to healthcare, and develop a new insurance model. The project 's primary goal is to create \"an integrated community health system of care for the working poor and uninsured immigrants. \" Its objectives include: educating and informing immigrant communities about insurance and health coverage; expanding immigrants ' eligibility for health programs; facilitating the inclusion of social services in health coverage; developing alternative models for financing affordable health cov- erage; documenting effective strategies for outreach and health coverage enrollment in immigrant communities; and collecting in-depth information about uninsured immigrants for continuing advocacy. Activities and Accomplishments of Oakland Community Voices Noteworthy features of the project include a profound level of commu- nity involvement and representation in the process; a partnership amongcommunity clinics, community organizations, and the local health depart-ment; and exceptional attentiveness to cultural competency. Providinghealth promotion and health care services in a culturally and linguisticallyappropriate manner is a routine part of \"doing business \" among these Oakland partners rather than a minor \"tag-on \" to the services that theyCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of the Public's Health in the 21st Century http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.htmlAPPENDIX F 459 provide. Asian Health Services even includes a Language and Cultural Ac- cess Program that provides translation services and interpreter training in atotal of seven languages. Another aspect of the relationship with the com-munity is both La Clinica 's and Asian Health Services ' use of community outreach workers as well as promotoras (female health promoters) to serve as links to the community, in addition to conducting community-basedhealth education and health promotion. La Clinica has also developed acurriculum for training promotoras on a range of health topics. The promotoras are paid through stipends and gift certificates. Asian Health Services conducts specialized, strategic outreach to the various populations that it serves, for instance, to Korean groups at churchesand to Vietnamese groups at street festivals. Outreach to diverse audiencesalso implies a need for awareness of and sensitivity to the socioculturalissues of new immigrants and other underserved populations. The County of Alameda Uninsured Survey was conducted by Commu- nity Voices in 2000 (Ponce et al., 2001). The random-probability telephonesurvey of more than 11,000 households resulted in 1,673 core question-naires completed by adults 18 and older in English and six other languages(over 40 percent of respondents). The main findings were as follows: More than 70 percent of uninsured adults in the county are people of color. More than half of the uninsured adults in the county are immi- grants. The county 's uninsured rate of 16 percent is lower than California 's rate of 25 percent. The objectives of the Oakland Community Voices program are imple- mented in part through the linked enrollment and outreach activities ofcommunity health specialists and community outreach workers based at LaClinica and Asian Health Services. In addition to their educational andhealth promotion activities, these community workers have made it a prior-ity to discuss issues of health access and health insurance with their commu-nities and to help facilitate linkage to medical homes for any families andindividuals who lack coverage. Through the efforts of a strategic collaborative, Oakland Community Voices has participated in the creation of a new health insurance productcalled Family Care, administered by Alameda Alliance for Health, the localnonprofit managed care plan The Alameda County Health Department has transformed its goals and services to become more community based and has increased staff capacityto work with the community. For instance, field staff have been organizedinto 11 community health teams to strengthen the relationship with theCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Day, MD, ATC; Kevin J. Cronin, MD R e s i d e n c y Resident Assembly Health Policy Committee 2019: A Year in Review The AAOS Resident Assembly's (RA) Health Policy Committee (HPC) comprises dozens of residents from across the country addressing issues impacting orthopaedic surgery and orthopaedic residency training. In 2019, the HPC continued to collaborate with AAOS to promote resident engagement in political advocacy, educate residents on health policy, and promote resident involvement in the Orthopaedic Political Action Committee (OrthoPAC). Health Policy Milestones Program The biggest accomplishment of 2019 was the unveiling of the Health Policy Milestones Program. The project was a long time in the making\u2014an action item from the RA's 2016 General Assembly in Orlando, Fla. The Health Policy Milestones Program was formally unveiled this year. In 2016, the HPC saw a gap in resident education regarding health policy and advocacy\u2014two essential components of any successful orthopaedic practice. To effectively advocate for patients and the future of orthopaedic care, orthopaedic surgeons must have a voice in policy discussions that dictate the way we provide care for our patients. To better educate orthopaedic residents on those topics, the Health Policy Milestones Program was developed in collaboration with the AAOS Office of Government Relations (OGR). The online educational program, accessible via the learn.aaos.org platform, provides an in-depth overview of health policy and the importance of involvement in advocacy during residency and beyond. Residents who complete the program become \"Resident Advocacy Ambassadors,\" which provides exclusive local and national advocacy opportunities. Residents have opportunities to work with the AAOS OGR, attend AAOS functions, and advocate with local and federal government. The hope is that residents will3/3/2021 Resident Assembly Health Policy Committee 2019: A Y ear in Review https://www .aaos.org/aaosnow/2020/aug/residency/residency01/ 2/3take advantage of this opportunity to develop a solid foundation in health policy and advocacy that can be used throughout their careers. Webinars The HPC hosted two successful webinars in 2019. The spring webinar, \"Why Advocacy Matters: A Resident Crash Course,\" was moderated by Kevin J. Cronin, MD, and hosted many other resident members of the HPC who provided information on topics such as student loan repayment, graduate medical education (GME), new tax laws, and OrthoPAC. Then the HPC was honored to host Representatives Brian Babin, DDS (R-Texas), and Jeff Van Drew, DMD (R-N.J.), for its winter webinar, \"AAOS REDI, Set, GO: Advocating for Student Loan Deferment,\" which was moderated by Molly A. Day, MD, ATC. The webinar provided an overview of current legislation aimed at providing interest-free deferment on student loans for borrowers in a medical or dental internship or residency program. The Resident Education Deferred Interest (REDI) Act was designed to provide some relief to young physicians and dentists as they face significant student loan debt post-training by halting the accrual of interest on loans that qualify for forbearance or deferment during internship or residency training. Both webinars received positive feedback and were well attended by residents from across the country. AAOS Now articles The HPC also published a number of articles in AAOS Now to update residents on current important advocacy issues. Topics included the opioid epidemic, GME funding, the Health Policy Milestones Program, resident involvement within the OrthoPAC, the Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act of 2019 (H.R. 1763), and the REDI Act (H.R. 5734). OrthoPAC OrthoPAC continued to break its own records in 2019, a testament to the dedication of its members to patients and the issues directly affecting patient care. Overall, OrthoPAC reached its best off-cycle fundraising year to date, raising more than $1.9 million. This could not have been accomplished without a strong showing from residents. Once again, 2019 served as a record year for resident participation within OrthoPAC, with highlights including the most-seen participation of residents and programs, highest dollar amount raised, and most residency programs reaching 100 percent participation. This past year, more than 400 residents from 74 residency programs across the country joined OrthoPAC. Additionally, 53 residents showed the highest level of commitment and3/3/2021 Resident Assembly Health Policy Committee 2019: A Y ear in Review https://www .aaos.org/aaosnow/2020/aug/residency/residency01/ 3/3joined the Futures Capital Club\u2014the largest ever. Most impressively, 2019 saw a 25 percent increase over 2018 in residency programs reaching Gold status or having 100 percent of their residents join the PAC. Ten residency programs, the most in the PAC's history, reached Gold status in 2019: Columbia University, Maimonides Medical Center, New York University, University of Connecticut, University of Hawaii, University of Iowa, University of Kentucky, University of Maryland, University of South Florida, and Universidad de Puerto Rico. In 2020, the PAC looks forward to building upon that success and continuing to break records. The year ahead The HPC continues to find new ways to keep residents informed of health policy changes that impact orthopaedic surgery and involve them in advocacy efforts that support patients and the profession. The committee will continue to communicate with residents via webinars and articles to convey current information and empower residents to get more involved in health advocacy efforts. The HPC is excited to hit the ground running and maintain committee momentum through another successful, active year. Calling all residents The AAOS RA HPC is looking for residents who are interested in impacting the field of orthopaedic surgery through developing health policy action items, educating residents, and promoting resident involvement in political issues that impact orthopaedists locally and nationally.
