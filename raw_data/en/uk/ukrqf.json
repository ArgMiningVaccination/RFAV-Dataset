The goal of the Day 1 Competencies is to assure that young veterinary professionals can support their Country's National Veterinary Services. To assess these competencies in regar ds to the proficiency level of the average Day 1 veterinary graduate s, the University of Gondar (UoG) and The Ohio State University (OSU) Twinning partners have developed an Evaluation Tool for OIE Day 1 Graduating Veterinarian Competencies . Through this tool, administrators and stakeholders will be able to systematically assess new veterinary graduates' level of understanding and competency of the skills and knowledge base outlined in the OIE Day 1 Competencies. This Evaluation Tool consists of a series of charts and tables , in which the components of the 11 specific and 8 advanced competency guidelines are expanded by breaking down the components of the OIE recommendations to more narrow subcomponents (many of them highlighted in the OIE Veterinary Education Core Curriculum Guidelines) . This approach allows to specifically and systematic qualify and quantify competence in each particular area of veterinary medicine covered in the Day 1 Competencies . This Tool also provides examples an d definitions of knowledge and performance expectations that allows to qualify a newly veterinary graduate from highly competent to insufficient or not competent. The Evaluation Tool defined a Highly Competent new DVM graduate as one who is very knowledgeable/skillful about the topic and is able to perform the task/activity without additional support or guidance. Moderately Competent individuals are knowledgeable or skillful about the topics but need some support or guidance to perform the task or activit y. New DVM graduates who are aware of the topic but require substantial support or assistance with the task or activity are classified as Insufficiently Competent . Those who are unaware of the topic and are unable to perform the task or activity without further education or training are considered Not Competent . If the topic is not currently in the veterinary curriculum being evaluated, then that topic should be recorded as such (Not in Curriculum ). If the evaluator is unfamiliar with the competency level of new graduates regarding a particular competency, they have the option to select \" Not Sure \". The results of the evaluation allow the users to define a specific and detail profile of the Day 1 veterinary graduates at their institutions with respect to th e OIE Day 1 Competencies. Information from this Evaluation Tool can subsequently be used to identify potential gaps or areas for improvement in the veterinary curriculum to strengthen the veterinary graduate's education. Additionally, the unique metrics from this tool could also be applied throughout the implementation of curricular revisions to assess their impact over time , as it provides a more objective measurement that can be determine pre and post intervention. The Evaluation Tool described herein was originally designed to be used in small -facilitated groups ( or workshop format ). Still, this Tool can be adapted for different formats such as town hall meeting or face - to-face interviews , depending on the audiences that must be reach . Nevertheless, no matter what format is been used, at the end this method will allow the systematic collect ion and analysis of the perception of faculty, veterinary students, recent graduates and stakeholders in regards to Day 1 graduates in a specific institution. Details and instructions on how to use this Tool in a workshop format are later provided in this manuscript . 3 Development and Deployment. While a curriculum review and mapping is need ed to determine fulfilment of the OIE recommended topics and courses in the veterinary curriculum . These approaches lack the ability to evaluate the effectiveness of the pedagogy methods used in the curriculum as well as the depth of knowledge and skills retained by the new graduates. Thus , an exclusive review based approach of the curriculum could potential miss deficits that will affect the \"final product\" coming out of a professional program . No because a topic is present in the curriculum, it means that it is properly t aught and/or that the students will be competent in the subject by time of graduation. Therefore, to supplement the curriculum review and mapping process, the UoG and OSU Veterinary Twinning Partners designed an Evaluation Tool to rate the p roficiency level of the average veterinary graduate's skills and knowledge base regarding the OIE Day 1 Competencies. After several rounds of editing and reviewing of this Tool, it was distributed to Ohio State veterinary faculty and new veterinary graduates for them to evaluate the OSU program . This pilot study allowed the partners to assess the ease of using the Evaluation Tool as well as to collect data regarding the competency level of the average OSU veterinary graduate with the OIE recommended guidelines . Minor changes were made to the Evaluation Tool b ased on the suggestions from the OSU veterinary faculty and new graduates, prior to its utilization in the Faculty Retreat to assess the average UoG veterinary graduate. Using the metrics provided by the Evaluation Tool, the UoG and OSU Twinning partners were able to identify specific competencies that were fulfil as well as others that required further development or improvement, recognizing at the same time other areas that newly graduates were completely missing. Then, using a backward analysis and curricular mapping ( also using as a reference the OIE Veterinary Education Core Curriculum Guidelines), multiple disparities or weak points were identified in our veterinary curriculums. From this p oint, the Twinning Partners move d forward in prioritizing these deficiencies and develop ing an action plan to address them in the veterinary curriculum. Keeping always in this process as a clear goal to improve the proficiency level of future graduates with respect to OIE Day 1 Competencies. In time, these changes should lead to a more qualified young veterinarians entering the workforce . Thus, in the long term, strengthening the quality of the C ountry 's veterinary services. In conclusion, with simple adaptations to the circumstances of each country and academic institutions, this Evaluation Tool could be used to assess the profile of young graduates from both , established veterinary curriculums as well as younger programs. Providing future Veterinary Twinning partners with an additional tool and a great resource to assist them on identifying the OIE Day 1 Competency gaps in their educational programs. 4 WORKSHOP FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS In the following format, all OIE Day 1 Competencies are reviewed by the participants in 4 thematic sections (see page 8 ), which are distributed during a one -day long workshop (see model agenda on page 9 ). PRE-ACTIVITY The use of this Evaluation Tool in the Workshop format requires some basic logistical preparation by the Coordinator (s) before its use: A. Read and familiarize yourself with the Evaluation Tool, B. Select and instruct group facilitators, C. Reserve appropriate me eting location and assign groups, D. Organize participant's packages, E. Organize day activities (Agenda) and plan p ost activity \"Evaluation.\" Facilitator's Instructions In this format, all the participants will be distributed among small groups to which a Facilitator will be assigned. I deally , each Facilitator should be highly familiarized with the OIE Day 1 Competencies and the institution to be assessed. However, to m inimize any bias the facilitators should n ot belong to the institution being considered . This professional level individual will help moderate the conversation among the group members , and encourage participation and timely progression through the Evaluation Tool . The facilitators leadership role should include such activities as providing examples for various evaluation points as necessary to foster pertinent discussion. - It is recommended to distribute the Evaluation Tool along with the OIE Day 1 Competencies in advance to allow Facilitator's time to review and become familiar with them. - A brief , but essential meeting with the coordinator (s) and all the facilitators to review the Evaluation Tool and walk through the dynamics of the Workshop shoul d take place before the event. This meeting will allow the coordinator (s) to explain the purpose of the exercise and the main expectations. 5 Location Reservations and Group Assignment This activity will require only one location: a large conference room in which individual tables can be set to sit 6 to 8 participants per table. All of the activity should take place at a single location , with a large conference room for the attendees to assemble to use during the general points of the agenda. But it should have available several multiple rooms or areas for the different groups to assemble during the workshop components, allowing them to have an open discussion without excessive background noise. - In order to facilitate a productive discussion environme nt while maintaining a schedule, i t is recommended to limit the group size to a maximum of 7 to 8 individuals per table (ideally 6 pe r group) , as larger group sizes could hinder a good discussion environment. - It is also recommended to create diverse groups that encourage open discussion and multiple viewpoints (i.e. faculty, staff, stakeholders, etc.). One option for forming groups coul d be to randomly assign participants to the different tables as they arrive while stratifying based upon individual backgrounds and experiences to achieve diversity. Alternative, group assignments could be made in advance based on backgrounds and experienc es of the participants (as was done at the UoG) . - It is also recommended to rotate the participants in each section, to increase the interchange of ideas and comments during the evaluations. See below details on the different groups to be created, in which all the participants must be evenly distributed. Participant's Packages Each participant will receive a customize d package containing only the charts to evaluate the specific c ompetencie s assigned to him/her. The charts to be included in that package will depend upon which group they are assigned (see break out of groups in page 10 ). For example: Participant 1' s package will contain the following charts based on his group assignment. Participant 1 was assigned to Should receive these charts on his/her package Group 1 in Session 1 2.1 Epidemiology Group 4 in Session 2 2.3 Zoonosis (including Food Borne Diseases) Group 6 in Session 3 2.10 General Certification 3.2 Inspection & Certification Group 8 in Session 4 3.5 Risk Analysis 3.6 Research 6 ACTIVITY DAY'S GUIDELINES After the coordinator (s) has welcomed the participants, introduced the facilitator(s) for the activity, and explains the main purpose and objectives of the Evaluation Tool, the coordinator (s) should proceed with the instructions and logistics of the activity explaining the dynamics to be followed during the Faculty Retreat . The coordinator (s) should then initiate the program by reviewing the competency level definitions (from h ighly competen t to no competent) and review the specific OIE Day 1 Competencies to be evaluated in each session. During this time, the coordinator (s) should give specific examples for the definitions of the level of competency. o Before the beginning of each thematic session, allow 2 0 minutes to review each of the OIE Day 1 Competencies and corresponding Evaluation Tool to be completed during one specific session. It is recommended that the coordinator (s) give examples of what is expected from a competent new graduate fo r each OIE Day 1 competency. o The coordinator (s) should remind participants that if the competency is not taught in the veterinary curriculum, they should mark the \"not in curriculum\" response on the Evaluation Tool and move onto the next portion of the c hart. o All the groups will then have 20 -25 minutes to discuss the ir assigned Evaluation Tool charts depending on their group assignment. The participants should discuss what they think would be the best response for each of the questions . o Each person in the group should try to express their opinion on the graduate's level of understanding in that specific OIE Day 1 Competency. o The facilitator should avoid allowing one individual to monopolize the whole conversation. o Once the time has exp ired, the facilitator should ask all participants to individually complete the Evaluation Tool and submit it to their facilitator. These responses will be tallied later to determine the gaps in the veterinary curriculum. o Since not every group will be evaluating the same OIE Day 1 Competencies during each session (due to time constraints) , an assembly vote on the overall new graduates' level of competency for each Evaluation Tool should be collected. This information can be compiled using an anonymous poll ing system such as iClickers \u00ae, TopHat \u00ae, or similar system. Later these result s will be compared with those obtained in the individual charts to identify potential discrepancies or biases. 7 o It is recommended to avoid displaying the assembly results in real time, as this might lead to biases in evaluating the next competencies to be discussed and future assembly votes. In our case, we presented OSU results provide them with an example of resul ts from another institution. However, th e specific information of the institutions be ing assessed can be displayed during the closing session as a review of the day's activities. o During the closing session, the coordinator should present an anticipated timeline of when the results from all 3 groups (faculty, students, and stakeholders) will be compile, analyzed and presented as part of the curricular gap analysis report , as well as approximate timeline for the prioritization activit ies and development of an action plan . Post -Activity Evaluation and A ssessment . Once the activity has concluded, the coordinator (s) should provide a short survey for the participants to evaluate the Evaluation Too l and the workshop at- large. This will allow the c oordinator (s) to provide feedback to improve the experience for future veterinary education twinning programs. A short meeting to debrief the facilitators post -activity could also provide insight for improvement in the Evaluation Tool or recommendations for future ve terinary education twinning programs. Therefore, it is highly recommended. 8 OIE Day 1 Competencies for Review During 4 Thematic Sessions Session 1: Epidemiology and Food Hygiene Session 2: Infectious Diseases Session 3: Regulatory Medicine Session 4: General Topics 2.1 Epidemiology 2.2 Transboundary Animal Diseases 2.9 Vet Legislation and Ethics 2.8 Animal Welfare 2.6 Basic Food Hygiene 2.3 Zoonosis (including Food Borne Diseases) 2.10 General Certification 2.11 Communication Skills 2.7 Veterinary Products 2.4 Emerging and Re - Emerging Diseases 3.2 Inspection and Certification Procedures 3.8 Administration and Management 3.4 Advance Food Hygiene 2.5 Disease Prevention and Control Programmes 3.1 Organization of Vet Services 3.6 Research 3.3 Management of Contagious Diseases 3.7 International Trade Framework 3.5 Risk Analysis 9 University of Gondar - Ohio State University OIE Veterinary Education Twinning Program UoG Faculty Retreat February 20, 2016 8:00 am Welcome and Opening Statements Dr. Achenef Melaku, Dean Faculty of Veterinary Medicine 8:15 am OIE Day 1 Competencies and Core Veterinary Curriculum Dr Samuel Wakhusama, OIE Representative of East Africa 8:35 am UoG Activities to Achieve Quality of Education Dr. Yemataw Wondie, Quality Assurance and Audit Directorate, Director, UoG 8:45 am Twinning Program, Faculty Retreat Logistics and Expectations Dr. Armando Hoet, Director OSU Veterinary Public Health Program 9:00 am Session 1: Epidemiology and Food Hygiene 20 minutes: Introduction of Competencies to be covered in this s ession 20-25 minutes: Group discussion (Chart Completion) 15 minutes: Assembly vote 10:15 am Break 10:45 am Session 2: Infectious Diseases 20 minutes: Introduction of Competencies to be covered in this session 20-25 minutes: Group discussion (Char t Completion) 15 minutes: Assembly vote 12:00 pm General Discussion 12:30 pm Lunch Break 2:00 pm Session 3: Regulatory Medicine 20 minutes: Introduction of Competencies to be covered in this session 20-25 minutes: Group discussion (Chart Completion) 15 minutes: Assembly vote 3:15 pm Break 3:30 pm Session 4: General Topics 20 minutes: Introduction of Competencies to be covered in this session 20-25 minutes: Group discussion (Chart Completion) 15 minutes: Assembly vote 5:00 pm General Discussion and Closing Remarks Dr Achenef Melaku and Dr Armando Hoet 10 Groups Distribution for the 4 Thematic Sections Group Session 1 Session 2 Session 3 Session 4 Group 1 2.1 Epidemiology 2.2 Transboundary Animal Diseases 2.9 Vet Legislation & Ethics 3.1 Veterinary Services 2.8 Animal Welfare Group 2 2.1 Epidemiology 2.2 Transboundary Animal Diseases 2.9 Vet Legislation & Ethics 3.1 Veterinary Services 2.8 Animal Welfare Group 3 2.1 Epidemiology 2.3 Zoonosis (including Food Borne Diseases) 2.9 Vet Legislation & Ethics 3.1 Veterinary Services 2.11 Communication Skills 3.8 Administration and Management Group 4 2.6 Basic Food Hygiene 2.3 Zoonosis (including Food Borne Diseases) 2.10 General Certification 3.2 Inspection & Certification 2.11 Communication Skills 3.8 Administration and Management Group 5 2.6 Basic Food Hygiene 2.4 Emerging and Reemerging Diseases 2.5 Prev. & Control Prog. 2.10 General Certification 3.2 Inspection & Certification 2.11 Communication Skills 3.8 Administration and Management Group 6 2.6 Basic Food Hygiene 2.4 Emerging Diseases 2.5 Prev. & Control Prog. 2.10 General Certification 3.2 Inspection & Certification 3.5 Risk Analysis 3.6 Research Group 7 2.7 Veterinary Products 3.4 Advance Food Hyg. 2.4 Emerging Diseases 2.5 Prev. & Control Prog. 3.7 International Trade Framework 3.5 Risk Analysis 3.6 Research Group 8 2.7 Veterinary Products 3.4 Advance Food Hyg. 3.3 Management of Contagious Diseases 3.7 International Trade Framework 3.5 Risk Analysis 3.6 Research Group 9 2.7 Veterinary Products 3.4 Advance Food Hyg. 3.3 Management of Contagious Diseases 11 EVALUATION TOOLS CHARTS Hoet/Tomasi\u00a92016 12 Evaluation of OIE Day 1 Competencies Session 1: Epidemiology and Food Hygiene Day 1 Competency: 2.1 Epidemiology a.)
