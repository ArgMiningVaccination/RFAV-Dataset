All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION vi DEDICATION Dr. Ralph Cicerone (1943-2016) was President of the National Academy of Sciences in 2015 when, in partnership with the President of the National Academy of Medicine, he announced a human genome editing initiative that would encompa ss science, ethics and regulation. He noted that the National Academies of Sciences, Engine ering, and Medicine have led the effort to develop responsible, comprehensive policies fo r many emerging and controversial areas of genetics and cell biology, such as human em bryonic stem cell research, human cloning, and \"gain-of-function\" resear ch. Most notable was its involvement in key events leading up to the 1975 Asilomar conference. But there are important differences between the Asilomar era and today, Dr. Cicerone said in an interview with Nature , because few researchers were pursuing recombinant DNA research in 1975. Modern geno me-editing techniques are easy to use and widely accessible, leading him to conclude that the situation require s an approach that is \"really more international than Asilomar ever had to be.\" Dr. Cicerone was as good as his word. In coll aboration with science and medicine academies from China and the United Kingdom, an initiativ e was launched with an international summit. From this came a commitment to future summits, and the formation of a study committee, with members hailing from or working in Canada, Ch ina, Egypt, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. This report is the culmination of the work by that committee and is dedicated to this great leader of the National Academy of Sciences. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The technology has excited interest acro ss the globe becaus e of the insights it may offer into fundamental biological proce sses and the advances it may bring to human health. But with these advances come many questions, about the technical aspects of achieving desired results while avoiding unwan ted effects, and about a range of uses that may include not only healing the sick, but also preventing disease in ourselves and future generations, or even altering traits unrelated to hea lth needs. Now is the time to consider these questions. Clinical trials using edited human somatic cells are alre ady underway and more are already anticipated. To help direct the use of genome editing towa rd broadly promoting human wellbeing, it is important to examine the scientific, ethical, and so cial issues it raises, a nd assess the capacity of governance systems to ensure its responsible de velopment and use. Doing this also entails articulating the larger principles that should underlie such systems. These were not easy tasks, but we are prof oundly grateful to the committee members who joined us in tackling our charge. They willingly and thoughtfully brought their diverse perspectives to bear on our discussions, and we thank them for their commitment to this study and for devoting so much of their time and energy over the last year. It ha s been a pleasure and a privilege to work with them. The report wa s also informed by many presentations and discussions with speakers whose contributions provided a wealth of information and insight. We thank them for sharing their research and vi ewpoints with us. Finally, on behalf of the committee, we would like to thank the staff of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine for working al ongside us throughout the study their ideas and support have been crucial to bringing th e project to fruition and thank the sponsors of the study, who had an expansive vision for its potential.

The development of new approaches\u2014involving the use of meganuc leases; and, the CRISPR/Cas9 system\u2014has made editing of the genome much more precise, efficient, flexible, and less expensive relative to previous strategies. With th ese advances has come an explosion of interest in the possible applications of genome editi ng, both in conducting fundamental research and potentially in promoting human health through the treatment or prevention of disease and disability. The latter possibilities range from restoring normal function in diseased organs by editing somatic cells to preventing genetic diseas es in future children and their descendants by editing the human germline. As with other medical advances , each such application comes with its own set of benefits, risks, regulatory framewor ks, ethical issues, and societal imp lications. Important questions raised with respect to genome editing in clude how to balance potential benefits against the risk of unintended harms; how to govern the use of these tec hnologies; how to incorporate societal values into salient clinical and policy cons iderations; and how to respect the inevitable differences, rooted in national cu ltures, that will shape perspec tives on whether and how to use these technologies. Recognizing both the promise and concerns related to human genome editing, the National Academy of Sciences and the National Acad emy of Medicine convened the Committee on Human Gene Editing: Scientific, Medical, and Ethi cal Considerations to carry out the study that is documented in this report. While genome editi ng has potential applicati ons in agriculture and non-human animals, this committee's task was focu sed on human applications. The charge to the committee included elements pertaining to the stat e of the science in ge nome editing, possible clinical applications of these technologies, potential risks and be nefits, whether standards can be established for quantifying unintended effects, wh ether current regulatory frameworks provide adequate oversight, and what overarching principles should guide the regulation of genome editing in humans. 1This summary does not include references. Citations for th e discussion presented in the summary appear in the subsequent report chapters. 2The term \"genome editing\" is used throughout this report to refer to the processes by which the genome sequence is changed by adding, replaci ng, or removing DNA base pairs. This term is used in lieu of \"gene editing\" because it is more accurate, as the editing could be targeted to sequences th at are not part of genes them selves, such as areas that regulate gene expression.

CRISPR (which stands for clustered regularly interspaced short pa lindromic repeats) refers to short, repeated segments of DNA originally discovered in bacter ia. These segments provided the foundation for the development of a system that combines s hort RNA sequences paired with Cas9 (CRISPR associated protein RNA-dir ected nuclease), or with simila r nucleases, and can readily be programmed to edit specific segments of DNA. The CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing system offers several advantages over previous strategies fo r making changes to the genome and has been at the center of much discussion concerning how genome editing could be applied to promote human health. Like the use of meganucleas es, ZFNs, and TALENs, CRISPR/Cas9 genome- editing technology exploits the ability to cr eate double-stranded breaks in DNA and the cells own DNA repair mechanisms to make precise changes to the genome. CRISPR/Cas9, however, can be engineered more easily and cheaply than th ese other methods to generate intended edits in the genome. The fact that these new genome-editing technologie s can be used to make precise changes in the genome at a high frequency and with consider able accuracy is drivin g intense interest in research to develop safe and effective therapies that use these approaches and that offer options beyond simply replacing an entire gene. It is now possible to insert or de lete single nucleotides, interrupt a gene or genetic element, make a si ngle-stranded break in DNA, modify a nucleotide, or make epigenetic changes to gene expressi on. In the realm of biom edicine, genome editing could be used for three broad purposes: for basi c research, for somatic interventions, and for germline interventions. Basic research can focus on cellular, molecu lar, biochemical, genetic, or immunological mechanisms, including those that affect repr oduction and the developm ent and progression of disease, as well as responses to treatment. Su ch research can involve work on human cells or tissues, but unless it has the inci dental effect of revealing info rmation about an identifiable, living individual, it does not i nvolve human subjects as defined by federa l regulation in the United States. Most basic research on human cells uses somatic ce lls\u2014nonreproductive cell types such as skin, liver, lung, and heart cells \u2014although some basic research uses germline (i.e., reproductive) cells, including early-stage human em bryos, eggs, sperm, and the cells that give rise to eggs and sperm. These latter cases entail ethical and re gulatory considerations regarding how the cells are collected and the purposes fo r which they are used, even though the research involves no pregnancy and no transmission of changes to another generation. Unlike basic research, clinical research involves interventions with human subjects. In the United States and most other countries with robust regulatory system s, proposed clinical applications must undergo a supe rvised research phase before becoming generally available to patients. Clinical applications of genome editing that target somatic cells affect only the patient, and are akin to existing efforts to use gene therapy for disease treatment and prevention; they do not affect offspring. By contrast, germline interv entions would be aimed at altering a genome in a way that would affect not only the resulti ng child but potentially some of the child's descendants as well.

All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance SUMMARY 3 PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION A number of the ethical, lega l, and social questions surr ounding gene therapy and human reproductive medicine provide a backdrop for cons ideration of key issues related to genome editing. When conducted carefully and with proper oversight, gene therapy research has enjoyed support from many stakeholder groups. But beca use such technologies as CRISPR/Cas9 have made genome editing so efficient and precise, th ey have opened up possi ble applications that have until now been viewed as largely theore tical. Germline editing to prevent genetically inherited disease is one example. Potential a pplications of editing for \"enhancement\"\u2014for changes that go beyond mere restoration or protection of heal th\u2014are another. Because genome editing is only beginning to tr ansition from basic research to clinical research applications, now is the time to evalua te the full range of its possible uses in humans and consider how to advance and govern these sc ientific developments. The speed at which the science is developing has genera ted considerable enthusiasm am ong scientists, industry, health- related advocacy organizations, and patient popul ations that perceive benefit from these advances. It is also raising c oncerns, such as those cited earlier, among policy makers and other interested parties to voice con cerns about whether appropriate sy stems are in place to govern the technologies, and whether societal values will be reflected in how genome editing is eventually applied in practice. Public input and engagement are important elements of many sc ientific and medical advances. This is particularly true with respec t to genome editing for poten tial applications that would be heritable\u2014those involving germline cells\u2014as well as those focused on goals other than disease treatment and prevention. Meani ngful engagement with decision makers and stakeholders promotes transpar ency, confers legitimacy and improves policy making. There are many ways to engage the public in these debate s, ranging from public information campaigns to formal calls for public comment and incor poration of public op inion into policy. APPLICATIONS OF HUMAN GENOME EDITING Genome editing is already being widely used for basic science research in laboratories; is in the early stages of development of clinical applications that involve somatic (i.e., nonreproductive) cells; and in the future might be usable for clinical applications involving reproductive cells, which would produce heritable changes. Basic Science Laboratory Research Basic laboratory research involving genome editing of human cells and tissues is critical to advancing biomedical science. Genome-editi ng research using somatic cells can advance understanding of molecular pr ocesses that control disease development and progression, potentially facilitating the ability to develop better interventions for affected people. Laboratory research involving genome editing of germ line cells can help in understanding human development and fertility, there by supporting advances in such ar eas as regenerative medicine and fertility treatment. The ethical issues associated with basic science research i nvolving genome editing are the same as those that arise with any basic res earch involving human cells or tissues, and these issues are already addressed by extensive regulatory infrastructures. There are, of course, enduring debates about limitations of the curren t system, particularly with respect to how it addresses the use of gametes, embryos, and feta l tissue, but the regulations are considered Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 4 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION adequate for oversight of basic science rese arch, as evidenced by their longevity. Special considerations may come into play for rese arch involving human gametes and embryos in jurisdictions where such research is permitted; in those cases, the current regulations governing such work will apply to genome-editing research as well. Overall, then, basic laboratory research in human genome editing is already manageable under existing ethical norms and regulatory frameworks at the local, state, and federal levels. Clinical Uses of Somatic Cell Editing for Treatment and Prevention of Disease and Disability An example of the application of genome editi ng to alter somatic (nonreproductive) cells for purposes of treating or preventing disease is a recen tly authorized clinical trial involving patients whose advanced cancer has failed to respond to such conventiona l treatments as chemotherapy and radiation. In this study, genom e editing is being used to progr am patients' immune cells to target the cancer. Somatic cells are all those pres ent in the tissues of the body except for sperm and egg cells and their precursors. This means that the effects of genome editing of somatic cells are limited to treated individuals and are not inherited by their offspring. The idea of making genetic changes to somatic cells\u2014referred to as \"gene thera py\"\u2014is not new and genome editing for somatic applications would be similar. Gene therapy ha s been governed by ethical norms and subject to regulatory oversight for some time, and this expe rience offers guidance for establishing similar norms and oversight mechanisms fo r genome editing of somatic cells. Somatic genome-editing therapies could be used in clinical pr actice in a number of ways. Some applications could invol ve removing relevant cells\u2014suc h as blood or bone marrow cells\u2014 from a person's body, making specific genetic changes, and then returning th e cells to that same individual. Because the edited cells would be outside the body (ex vivo), the success of the editing could be verified before the cells were replaced in the patient. Somatic genome editing also could be performed directly in the body (in vivo) by injecting a genome- editing tool into the bloodstream or target organ. Tec hnical challenges remain, however , to the effective delivery of in vivo genome editing. Gene-editing tools intro duced into the body might not find their target gene within the intended cell type efficiently. The re sult could be little or no health benefit to the patient, or even unintended harm, such as in advertent effects on germline cells, for which screening would be necessary. Despite these chal lenges, however, clinical trials of in vivo editing strategies are already under way fo r hemophilia B and mucopolysaccharidosis I. The primary scientific and techni cal, ethical, and regulatory issues associated with the use of somatic gene therapies to treat or prevent diseas e or disability concern only the individual. The scientific and technical issues of genome editing, such as the as-yet incompletely developed standards for measuring and evaluating off-ta rget events, can be resolved through ongoing improvements in efficiency and accuracy, while th e ethical and regulatory issues would be taken into account as part of existing regulatory fr ameworks that involve a ssessing the balance of anticipated risks and benefits to a patient. Overall, the committee concluded that the et hical norms and regulatory regimes developed for human clinical research, gene transfer research, and existing so matic cell therapy are appropriate for the management of new somatic genome-editing applications aimed at treating or preventing disease and disability. However, off- target effects will vary with the platform technology, cell type, target gene, an d other factors. As a result, no single standard for somatic genome-editing efficiency or specificity\u2014and no single acceptable off-target rate\u2014can be Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance SUMMARY 5 PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION defined at this time. For this reason, and because, as noted above, somatic genome editing can be carried out in a number of differe nt ways, regulators will need to consider the technical context of the genome-editing system as well as the proposed clinical application in weighing anticipated risks and benefits. Germline Editing and Heritable Changes Although editing of an individual's germline (re productive) cells has been achieved in animals, there are major technical challenges to be addressed in developing this technology for safe and predictable use in humans. Nonetheless, the technology is of interest because thousands of inherited diseases are cause d by mutations in single genes.3 Thus, editing the germline cells of individuals who carry these muta tions could allow them to have genetically related children without the risk of passing on these conditions. Germline genome editing is unlikely to be used often enough in the foreseeable future to have a significant effect on the prevalence of these diseases but could provide some families with th eir best or most acceptable option for averting disease transmission, either because existing tech nologies, such as prenatal or preimplantation genetic diagnosis, will not work in some cases or because the existing technologies involve discarding affected embryos or using selec tive abortion following prenatal diagnosis. At the same time, however, germline editing is highly contentious precisely because the resulting genetic changes would be inherited by the next genera tion, and the technology therefore would cross a line many have viewed as ethically inviolable. The possibility of making heritable changes through the use of germline genome editing moves the conversation away from individual-level concerns and to ward significantly more complex technical, social, and religious concerns regarding the appropriate ness of this degree of interventi on in nature and the potential effects of such changes on acceptance of children born with disabilities. Policy in this area will require a careful balancing of cultural norms, th e physical and emotional well-being of children, parental autonomy, and the ability of regulator y systems to prevent in appropriate or abusive applications. In light of the technical and social concerns involved, the committee concluded that germline genome-editing research trials might be permitted, but only following much more research aimed at meeting existing risk/benefit standards for aut horizing clinical trials and even then, only for compelling reasons and under strict oversight. It would be essential for this research to be approached with caution, and for it to proceed with broad public input. In the United States, authoritie s currently are unable to consid er proposals for this research because of an ongoing prohibition on the U.S. F ood and Drug Administration's (FDA's) use of federal funds to review \"research in which a hum an embryo is intentionally created or modified to include a heritable genetic modification.\" 4 In a number of other countries, germline genome- editing trials would be prohibited entirely. If U.S. restrictions on such trials were allowed to expire or if countries without legal prohibitions were to proceed with th em, it would be essential to limit these trials only to the most compelling circumstances, to subject them to a comprehensive oversight framework that woul d protect the research subjects and their descendants, and to institute safeguards against inappropriate expansion in to uses that are less 3OMIM, https://www.omim.org (accessed January 5, 2017); 5, tions Act of 2016, Public Law 114- 113 (adopted December 18, 2015).

In particular, clin ical trials using heri table germline editing should be permitted only if done within a regula tory framework that includes the following criteria and structures: absence of reasonable alternatives; restriction to preventing a serious disease or condition; restriction to editing genes th at have been convincingly de monstrated to cause or to strongly predispose to th e disease or condition; restriction to converting such genes to versions that are pr evalent in the population and are known to be associated with ordinary hea lth with little or no evidence of adverse effects; availability of credible pre- clinical and/or clinical data on risks and potential health benefits of the procedures; ongoing, rigorous oversight during clinical trials of the effe cts of the procedure on the health and safety of the research participants; comprehensive plans for long-term, multigen erational follow-up while still respecting personal autonomy; maximum transparency consistent with patient privacy; continued reassessment of both health and so cietal benefits and risks, with broad on- going participation and input by the public; and reliable oversight mechanisms to prevent extension to uses other than preventing a serious disease or condition. Even those who will support this recommendation are unlikely to arrive at it by the same reasoning. For those who find the benefits sufficien tly compelling, the above criteria represent a commitment to promoting well-being within a fr amework of due care and responsible science. Those not completely persuaded that the benefi ts outweigh the social concerns may nonetheless conclude that these criteria, if properly implemented, are strict enough to prevent the harms they fear. It is important to note that such concepts as \"reasonable alternativ es\" and \"serious disease or condition\" embedded in these criteria are nece ssarily vague. Different societies will interpret these concepts in the context of their diverse hist orical, cultural, and social characteristics, taking into account input from their publics and thei r relevant regulatory authorities. Likewise, physicians and patients will interpret them in light of the specifics of individual cases for which germline genome editing may be considered as a possible option. Star ting points for defining some of these concepts exist, such as the defini tion of \"serious disease or condition\" used by the U.S. FDA.5 Finally, those opposed to germline edi ting may even conclude that, properly implemented, the above criteria are so strict that they would have the effect of preventing all clinical trials involving germline genome editing. 5While not drafted with the above criteria in mind, the FDA definition of \"serious diseas e or condition\" is \"a disease or condition associated with morbidity that has substantial impact on day-to-day functioning. Short-lived and self- limiting morbidity will usually not be sufficient, but the morb idity need not be irreversible if it is persistent or recurrent. Whether a disease or condition is serious is a ma tter of clinical judgment, based on its impact on such factors as survival, day-to-day functioning, or the likelihood that the disease, if left untreated, will progress from a less severe condition to a more serious one\" (21 CFR 312.300(b)(1)).

All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance SUMMARY 7 PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION Use of Genome Editing for \"Enhancement\" Although much of the current discussion around genome editing focuses on how these technologies can be used to treat or prevent di sease and disability, some aspects of the public debate concern other purposes, such as the possi bility of enhancing trai ts and capacities beyond levels considered typical of adequate health. In theory, genome editing for such enhancement purposes could involve both somatic and germline cells. Such uses of the technologies raise questions of fairness, social norms, pers onal autonomy, and the role of government. To begin, it is necessary to define what is meant by \"enhancement.\" Formulating this definition requires a careful exam ination of how various stakehol ders conceptualize \"normal.\" For example, using genome editing to lower the cholesterol level of so meone with abnormally high cholesterol might be consider ed prevention of heart disease, but using it to lower cholesterol that is in the desirable range is less easily ch aracterized, and would eith er intervention differ from the current use of statins? Likewise, using genome editing to improve musculature for patients with muscular dystrophy would be consid ered a restorative treatment, whereas doing so for individuals with no known pathology and average capabilities just to make them stronger but still within the \"normal\" range might be cons idered enhancement. And using the technology to increase someone's muscle strength to the ex treme end of human capacity (or beyond) would almost certainly be considered enhancement. Regardless of the specific definiti on, there is some indication of public discomfort with using genome editing for what is deemed to be enhanc ement, whether for fear of exacerbating social inequities or of creating social pressure for peop le to use technologies th ey would not otherwise choose. Precisely because of the difficulty of ev aluating the benefit of an enhancement to an individual given the large role of subjective factors, public disc ussion is needed to inform the regulatory risk/benefit analyses that underlie deci sions to permit research or approve marketing. Public discussion also is need ed to explore social impacts, both real and anticipated, as governance policy for such applications is de veloped. The committee recommends that genome editing for purposes other than treatment or prevention of dise ase and disability should not proceed at this time, and that it is essential fo r these public discussions to precede any decisions about whether or how to pursue clini cal trials of such applications. Public Engagement Public engagement is always an importan t part of regulation and oversight for new technologies. As noted above, for somatic genome editing, it is essential that transparent and inclusive public policy debates precede any consider ation of whether to authorize clinical trials for indications that go beyond treatment or pr evention of disease or disability (e.g., for enhancement). With respect to heritable germlin e editing, broad participation and input by the public and ongoing reassessment of both health and societal benefits and risks are particularly critical conditions for appr oval of clinical trials. At present, a number of mechanisms for pub lic communication and consultation are built into the U.S. regulatory system, including some designed specifically for gene therapy, whose purview would include human genome editing. In some cases, regulatory rules and guidance documents are issued only after extensive public comment and agency response. Discussion is fostered by the various state and federal bioethic s commissions, which ty pically bring together technical experts and social scientists in meeti ngs that are open to th e public.

Other countries, su ch as France and the United Kingdom, have mechanisms that involve formal polling or hearings to en sure that diverse viewpoints are heard. PRINCIPLES TO GUIDE THE GOVERN ANCE OF HUMAN GENOME EDITING One of the charges to the committee was to iden tify principles that many countries might be able to use to govern human genome editing. Th e principles identified by the committee are detailed in Box S-1. The committee recommends that any nation cons idering governance of human genome editing can incorporate these principles and the responsib ilities that flow therefrom into its regulatory stru ctures and processes. BOX S-1 Principles for the Governance of Human Genome Editing 1. Promoting well-being: The principle of promoting well-being supports providing benefit and preventing harm to those affected, often referred to in the bioethics literature as the principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence. Responsibilities that flow from adherence to this principle include (1) pursuing applications of human genome editing that promote the health and well-being of individuals, such as treating or preventing disease, while minimizing risk to individuals in early applications with a high degree of uncertainty; and (2) ensuring a reasonable balance of risk and benefit for any application of human genome editing. 2. Transparency: The principle of transparency requires openness and sharing of information in ways that are accessible and understandable to stakeholders. Responsibilities that flow from adherence to this principle include (1) a commitment to disclosure of information to the fullest extent possible and in a timely manner, and (2) meaningful public input into the policy-making process related to human genome editing, as well as other novel and disruptive technologies. 3. Due care: The principle of due care for patients enrolled in research studies or receiving clinical care requires proceeding carefully and deliberately, and only when supported by sufficient and robust evidence. Responsibilities that flow from adherence to this principle include proceeding cautiously and incrementally, under appropriate supervision and in ways that allow for frequent reassessment in light of future advances and cultural opinions. 4. Responsible science: The principle of responsible science underpins adherence to the highest standards of research, from bench to bedside, in accordance with international and professional norms. Responsibilities that flow from adherence to this principle include a commitment to (1) high- quality experimental design and analysis, (2) appropriate review and evaluation of protocols and resulting data, (3) transparency, and (4) correction of false or misleading data or analysis. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance SUMMARY 9 PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION 5. Respect for persons: The principle of respect for persons requires recognition of the personal dignity of all individuals, acknowledg ment of the centrality of personal choice, and respect for individual decisions. All people have equal moral value, regardless of their genetic qualities. Responsibilities that flow from adherence to this principle include (1) a commitment to the equal value of all individuals, (2) respect for and promotion of individual decision making, (3) a commitment to preventing recurrence of the abusive forms of eugenics practiced in the past, and (4) a commitment to destigmatizing disability. 6. Fairness: The principle of fairness requires that like cases be treated alike, and that risks and benefits be equitably distributed (distributive justice). Responsibilities that flow from adherence to this principle include (1) equitable distribution of the burdens and benefits of research and (2) broad and equitable access to the benefits of resulting clinical applications of human genome editing. 7. Transnational cooperation: The principle of transnational cooperation supports a commitment to collaborative approaches to research and governance while respecting different cultural contexts. Responsibilities that flow from adherence to this principle include (1) respect for differing national policies, (2) coordination of regulatory standards and procedures whenever possible, and (3) transnational collaboration and data sharing among different scientific communities and responsible regulatory authorities. RECOMMENDATIONS In light of the considerations detaile d above, the committee made a series of recommendations targeted to basic research a nd to clinical applications, both somatic and germline.

The development of new approaches\u2014involving the use of meganuc leases; and, the CRISPR/Cas9 system\u2014has made editing of the genome much more precise, efficient, flexible, and less expensive relative to previous strategies. With th ese advances has come an explosion of interest in the possible applications of genome editi ng, both in conducting fundamental research and potentially in promoting human health through the treatment or prevention of disease and disability. The latter possibilit ies range from editing somatic cel ls to restore normal function in diseased organs to editing the human germline to prevent genetic diseases in future children and their descendants. As with other medical advances, each application comes with its own set of benefits, risks, regulatory questions, ethical issu es, and societal implications. Im portant questions raised with respect to genome editing include how to balance potential benefits against the risk of unintended harms; how to govern the use of these tec hnologies; how to incorporate societal values into salient clinical and policy cons iderations; and how to respect the inevitable differences, rooted in national cu ltures, that will shape perspec tives on whether and how to use these technologies. Recognizing both the promise and concerns related to human genome editing, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) 7 convened the Committee on Human Gene Editing: Scientific, Medica l, and Ethical Considerations to carry out the study that is documented in this report. Wh ile genome editing has potential applications for use in agriculture and nonhuman animals,8 this committee's task (s ee Box 1-1) was focused on 6The term \"genome editing\" is used throughout this report to refer to the processes by which the genome sequence is changed by adding, replaci ng, or removing DNA base pairs. This term is used in lieu of \"gene editing\" because it is more accurate, as the editing could be targeted to sequences th at are not part of genes them selves, such as areas that regulate gene expression. 7The NAS and the NAM are referred to throughout this report simply as the National Academies, or the U.S. National Academies when discussed in relation to the academies of other nations. Until 2016, the NAM was known as the Institute of Medicine (IOM). 8In January 2017, the FDA issued revised draft guidances addressing the regulatory pathway for intentionally altered genomic DNA in plants and non-human animals. This would include DNA intentionally altered through genomic editing.

BOX 1-1 Statement of Task The study will examine the scientific underpinnings as well as the clinical, ethical, legal, and social implications of the use of human genome editing technologies in biomedical research and medicine. It will address the following issues related to human gene editing, including editing of the human germline: 1. What is the current state of the science of human gene editing, as well as possible future directions and challenges to further advances in this research? 2. What are the potential clinical applications that may hold promise for the treatment of human diseases? What alternative approaches exist? 3. What is known about the efficacy and risks of gene editing in humans, and what research might increase the specificity and efficacy of human gene editing while reducing risks? Will further advances in gene editing introduce additional potential clinical applications while reducing concerns about patient safety? 4. Can or should explicit scientific standards be established for quantifying off-target genome alterations and, if so, how should such standards be applied for use in the treatment of human diseases? 5. Do current ethical and legal standards for human subjects research adequately address human gene editing, including germline editing? What are the ethical, legal, and social implications of the use of current and projected gene-editing technologies in humans? 6. What principles or frameworks might provide appropriate oversight for somatic and germline editing in humans? How might they help determine whether, and which applications of, gene editing in humans should or should not go forward? What safeguards should be in place to ensure proper conduct of gene-editing research and use of gene-editing techniques? 7. Provide examples of how these issues are being addressed in the international context. What are the prospects for harm onizing policies? What can be learned from the approaches being applied in different jurisdictions? drugs, devices and biologics.

STUDY CONTEXT The NAS and the NAM Human Gene-Editing Initiative In light of the promise of genome editing and th e associated regulatory and ethical issues, the NAS and the NAM established an initiative to explor e these issues in greate r depth and facilitate U.S. and international dialogue on how to addres s them. The first activity of this Human Gene- Editing Initiative was the conveni ng of the International Summ it on Human Gene Editing: A Global Discussion jointly with the Chinese Academ y of Sciences and The Royal Society of the United Kingdom. This 3-day event addressed a numb er of scientific advances in the development of modern genome-editing tools, potential medical uses of thes e tools in human patients, and ethical and social issues their uses might pose. The organizing committee released a statement that summarized its conclusions from th e meeting (NASEM, 2016d) . Panel chair David Baltimore also noted \"we hope that our discus sion here will serve as a foundation for a meaningful and ongoing global dialogue\" ( NASEM, 2016d). All three nations embraced the statement's call for continued research on gene editing, further deliberation with regard to heritable changes, and a continue d public discourse on the topic.10 The summit provided important input to the present study, as did ot her studies by the NAS and the NAM on related topics (see Box 1-2). BOX 1-2 Related Studies of the NAS and the NAM Genome Editing in Nonhuman Organisms Because genome-editing methods such as the CRISPR/Cas9 system are simply tools, they can be applied in myriad ways to achieve genetic changes in cells in the laboratory, in microbes, in nonhuman organisms, or in human s ubjects. The present study, which focuses on the use of genome editing in humans, is part of a broader examination by the U.S. National Academies of the implications of genome editing across a number of applications that also includes projects addressing the following: Genetically Engineered Crops: Experiences and Prospects \u2014This report addresses safety, environmental, regulatory, and other aspects of food crops developed through the use of genetic engineering technology. Such crops can be produced using a number of methods, and new genome-editing tools are among them (NASEM, 10Statement by Ralph J. Cicerone, President, U.S. National Academy of Sciences; Victor J. Dzau, President, U.S. National Academy of Medicine; Chunli Bai, President, Chinese Academy of Sciences; The Royal Society; (accessed January 24, 2017). Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Gene Drives on the Horizon: Advancing Science, Navigating Uncertainty, and Aligning Research with Public Values \u2014This report focuses on a specific application enabled by CRISPR/Cas9 technology that allows genetic changes to spread in a population in the absence of selective advantage. This technology is not applicable to every species and is most commonly proposed for uses such as insect vector control. The ability of heritable genetic changes to spread through an ecosystem raises its own complex set of scientific, ethical, and governance challenges (NASEM, 2016b). Workshop on Gene Editing to Modify Animal Genomes for Research: Scientific and Ethical Considerations (Institute for Animal Laboratory Research [ILAR] Roundtable) \u2014Genome-editing tools can be used to produce laboratory animal models enabling better study of diseases, as well as to produce livestock with desired traits. The workshop explored animal uses of genome editing, along with associated ethical and regulatory considerations.a Future Biotechnology Products and Opportunities to Enhance Capabilities of the Biotechnology Regulatory System \u2014As the types of products that can be created through biotechnology expand, these products are evaluated in regulatory frameworks initially created decades ago. This ongoing study is examining capabilities and expertise that may be needed by U.S. regulatory systems to assess and regulate future products that could be created through a number of technologies, including genome editing. The study is not addressing the development and regulation of human drugs or medical devices.b Other Studies on Clinical Research and Applications Not specific to genome editing but pertinent to discussions about all of its clinical applications are several other recent National Academies reports. Oversight and Review of Clinical Gene Transfer Protocols: Assessing the Role of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee was a report on the role of the U.S. Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC), recommending that it move toward more judicious use of its advisory power to review specific protocols, and that it focus primarily on novel applications of gene therapy or on providing a venue for broad public debate about the therapy (IOM2014). Mitochondrial Replacement Techniques: Ethical, Social, and Policy Considerations: presents an analysis of the special opportunities and concerns associated with making changes in mitochondrial DNA in gametes or embryos (NASEM, 2016e). Guidelines for Embryonic Stem Cell Research (IOM, 2005; NRC and IOM, 2007, 2008, 2010): outline the regulatory landscape and provide a roadmap for professional self-regulation for emerging technologies that generate considerable public interest and controversy. Studies on Public Engagement and Science Communication Communicating science effectively: A research agenda finds that people rarely make decisions based only on scientific information; they also consider their own goals and values, and a focus on knowledge alone is not enough to achieve communication goals (NASEM 2016a).

This committee was convened to continue th e dialogue initiated by th e International Summit and to undertake a year-long, in-depth consensus st udy. As specified in its statement of task (see Box 1-1), the committee examined the state of the science in human genome editing, its potential applications, and the ethical issues that need to be considered in deciding how to govern the use of these powerful new tools. This report is th e product of that study and, as with all other Academies consensus studies, underwent peer re view by an independent panel of experts. Additional activities of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and The Royal Society of the United Kingdom are anticipated, includi ng another internationa l summit to take plac e in China in 2017. BACKGROUND U.S. and International Policy Discussions Among the earliest calls for a detailed examin ation of the implications of genome-editing technologies were those made by members of th e scientific community engaged in developing these tools and advancing thei r clinical applications. In 2015 a group of investigators and ethicists, including CRISPR/Cas9 developers, me t in Napa, California, and subsequently published a request for the community to expl ore the nature of human genome editing and provide guidance on its acceptable uses (Baltimore et al., 2015). That same year, a number of articles and commentaries appearin g in scientific journals and th e popular press called attention to scientific and ethical challenges that w ould be posed by CRISPR/Cas9 and similar genetic tools (Bosley et al., 2015; Editing Human ity, 2015; Lanphier et al., 2015; Maxmen, 2015; Specter, 2015). Professional bodies, international organizati ons, and national academies of sciences and medicine further raised the profile of genome editing by issuing statements on its appropriate uses, particularly in reference to the potent ial for creating heritabl e genetic modifications. Among others, they included the U.K. Academ y of Medical Scien ces and a number of collaborative partners; the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies, an advisory body to the president of the Europ ean Commission; the Counc il of Europe; and the International Society for Stem Cell Research (A MS et al., 2015; Council of Europe, 2015; EGE, 2016; Friedmann et al., 2015; Hinxton Group, 2015; 2015).

BOX 1-3 Excerpts from Selected Calls Around the World for Continued Study and Public Discussion China, the U.K. and the U.S. This is an important moment in human history and we have a responsibility to provide all sections of society with an informed basis for making decisions about this technology, especially for uses that would affect generations to come. (NASEM, 2016d) France \"Our recommendations include setting up a European committee of experts from different disciplines to assess the scope, efficacy and safety of CRISPR-Cas9, and reviewing the ban on all genetic modifications to the germline\" (Hirsch et al, 2017). \"[We recommend the] establishment of multidisciplinary discussions on the questions posed by the techniques for the germline and embr yonic genome editing...considered as part of a wider debate on all the medical technologies...with potential effects on the genome of unborn children and, possibly, that of subsequent generations\" (ANM, 2016). Germany \"It is important to have an objective debate that informs all stakeholders in a clear and transparent manner about the status of research and development into the techniques, and to ensure that any decisions taken are bas ed on sound scientific evidence\" (Leopoldina, 2015) The Netherlands \"Public debate would give patients, care providers and society an opportunity to discuss controversial issues, to assess the risks, advantages and conditions of potential germline applications based on growing scientific insight, and to develop good practices and further regulation\" (KNAW, 2016). UK \"Active early engagement with a wide range of global stakeholders will therefore be needed, which should include, but not be limited to, biomedical and social scientists, ethicists, healthcare professionals, research funders, regulators, affected patients and their families, and the wider public\" (AMS et al., 2015).

In the area of health and medicine, scientists and clinicians have long sought to apply the techniques of mol ecular biology to understand basic biology\u2014including embryonic development, physiology, and the immune and nervous systems\u2014and to treat or prevent disease. Much pr ogress has been made in elucidating the role of genetics in diseases, ranging from sickle-cell an emia, muscular dystrophy, and cystic fibrosis, to such conditions as deafness, short stature, and blindness. The development of many such diseases and conditions has a genetic component. Some result from straightforward single-gene changes, but most involve a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and other factors that remain only imperfectly understood. Furthermore, genetic sequences themse lves paint only part of the biological picture. Regul ation of how and when genes are turned on and off, including the role of the epigenome,11 continues to be actively explore d. Controlled gene expression and epigenetic alterations influence how tissues develop and differentiate and have clinical ramifications in such areas as cancer and embryonic development. Tools that enable investigators to alter DNA sequences in order to understand or improve their function are not new. Recent years, however , have seen the development of a suite of genome-editing tools that allow for easier, bett er controlled, and more accurate changes to DNA inside cells. These tools are ba sed on exogenous enzymes that cut DNA at specific locations, combined with endogenous processes that repair the broken DNA, thereby enabling letters of the genetic code to be added, modi fied, or deleted. The speed with which this technology has been adopted in research laboratories and further adapted to tackle addi tional scientific challenges is a reflection of how powerful a technique the editing of genes and genomes will be for the scientific and clinical communities. The earliest applications of nuclease-based genome-editing methods employed targeted recognition of specific DNA sequences by pr oteins: homing nucleases (also known as meganucleases), ZFNs, and TALENs. However, th e recent development of RNA-based targeting has greatly simplified the process of genome ed iting. The first publications on the subject, in 2012-2013, explained how the CRISPR/Cas9 system, de rived from a natural bacterial defense mechanism against infecting viruse s, can be harnessed to make c ontrolled genetic changes in any DNA, including that of human cells (Cho et al ., 2013; Cong et al., 2013; Jinek et al., 2012, 2013; Mali et al., 2013). This was a game-changing advan ce. These methods have rapidly been adopted by scientists worldwide and have greatly accelerated fundamental research that has included altering cells in the laboratory to study the func tions of particular genes, developing models for studies of human diseases using stem cells or la boratory animals, creating modified plants and animals to improve food production, and developi ng therapeutic uses in humans. Genome editing has rapidly become an invaluable core technol ogy in research laborat ories and biotechnology companies, and is already moving trials (e.g., Cyra noski, al., 2010). 11The term \"epigenome\" refers to a set of chemical modifications to the DNA of the genome and to proteins and RNAs that bind to DNA in the chromosomes to affect whether and how genes are expressed.

Treatments based on genome editing are intended to make controlled modifications to specific portions of the DNA that affect the functions of their target(s) while a voiding changes to other portions whose alteration is not de sired. The latter alterations, referred to as off-target events, could have consequences, many unnoticeable but others damaging, depending on their location and their effects. In general, human genome ed iting raises questions common to the process of researching and developing new tr eatments: which conditions or di seases are most suitable to address with these technologies , how to identify and evaluate off-target events and other potential side effects, and which patients are mo st appropriate for studies . As described in this report, regulatory systems for addressing the i ndividual-level concerns associated with genome editing already exist in the Un ited States and many other countries, but can be improved. Societal-Level Concerns The use of genome editing also has significant so cial dimensions that vary depending on the proposed application. The use of a genome-editing treatment w hose effects are nonheritable and are restricted to an individual patient may not di ffer greatly from the use of a traditional drug or medical device. By contrast, making changes that may be inherited by future generations raises questions about the extent to wh ich the long-term effects of propos ed edits can be predicted and whether it is appropriate for huma ns to purposely alter any aspect of their genetic future (Frankel and Chapman, 2000; Juengst, 1991; Parens, 1995). In addition, identifying the increased range of applications made possible by genome editing ma y be yet another challenge to conventional conceptions of what constitutes a disease or disa bility. Societal-level concerns are particularly acute with respect to genome-editing interventi ons aimed at enhancing human capabilities. Such applications also raise ques tions about how to define a nd promote fairness and equity (President's Council on Bioethics, 2003). Moreover, as with othe r genetic technologies, such genome-editing applications may raise concerns about coercive and abusive eugenics programs of the past, which were based on faulty science a nd served discriminatory political goals (Wailoo et al., 2012). Looking Beyond Safety and Efficacy Although the nature of the debate surrounding ge nome editing is not new, the tools available in the past for making genetic modifications in human cells were time-consuming, difficult, and expensive, and were unlikely to be used outsi de of specialized medical applications. Recent genome-editing technologies, particularly the CRISPR/Cas9 system, have greatly expanded the landscape of potential applic ations and potential users. Their rapid development and adoption also have shortened the timeline for discussion of what appropriate governance structures need to be identified or developed. As the safety and e fficacy of these technolog ies continue to improve, the critical question will become not whether scie ntists and clinicians can use genome editing to make a certain change, but whether they should.

Thorny issues around acceptable uses of the technology in hu mans will depend on more than scientific considerations, and may increasi ngly involve weighing factors beyond individual-level risks and benefits (NRC, 1996). Layered on the scientific and et hical issues associated with human genome editing is the question of how to govern its appl ication so as to facilitate it s appropriate use and avoid its misuse. Determining the limits of the technologie s' uses and the regulatory mechanisms needed to enforce these limits will vary according to each nation's cultural, political, and legal context. But whether and how best to move human genome editing forward has implications for transnational scientific coopera tion that require ongoing public di scussion and input into policy making. There is ample precedent for scientists and other stakeholders to engage in just such activities, and this report is intended to build on points raised by a number of international conventions and declarations, such as th e Oviedo Convention (1997), the International Declaration on Human Genetic Da ta (2003), and the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights (2005) (Andor no, 2005; UNESCO, 2004a, 2005). STUDY APPROACH To address its complex task (see Box 1-1), the committee included members with expertise in basic and clinical research, in the development of human gene tic therapies, and in U.S. and international legal and regulatory frameworks. It included biologists, bi oethicists, and social scientists, and incorpor ated perspectives from potentially affected patient and stakeholder communities. Because the ethical and social issues posed by human genome editing transcend national boundaries, the committee included not only U.S. members but also those who are citizens of or are currently working in Canada , China, Egypt, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Brief biographies of the committee members are found in Appendix D. This study was informed not only by the In ternational Summit described earlier, which immediately preceded the committee's first meeting, but also by review of the salient literature, additional meetings, and speakers who generously shared their knowledge with the committee. Further information on the process by which th e committee conducted this study is provided in Appendix C. In evaluating the implications of new genome -editing tools, the committee also reviewed scientific progress, ethical debates, and regulat ory structures related to the use in humans of medical developments such as assisted reprodu ctive technologies, stem cell therapies, gene transfer, and mitochondrial repla cement techniques. These developm ents interface with those of genome editing since editing of stem cells has pot ential clinical applications for treating or preventing disease, and reproducti ve technologies would have to be used in combination with genome editing for any heritable application of the latter technologies. As these other technologies have advanced, lega l and regulatory frameworks and ethical norms of conduct have been developed to provide guidance on their a ppropriate human uses and oversight (Health Canada, 2016; HFEA, 2014; IOM, 2005; NAS EM, 2008; Nuffield Council, 2016a; Pr\u00e4g and Mills, 2015; Qiao and Feng, 2014). The reports cited here helped provide a basis for the committee's assessment of the use of genome-editing tools in humans and are referenced in subsequent chapters where relevant.

All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 20 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT The report begins by reviewing internationa l norms that are embodied in the set of overarching principles adopted by the comm ittee for governance of human genome editing (Chapter 2). The chapter conti nues with an overview of the U. S. regulation of research and clinical application of genome editing, drawing comparisons where appropriate to other national systems of oversight. With this grounding in principles and regula tion, Chapters 3-6 delve into human genome- editing technology and the scientific issues, regulatory context, and ethical implications of four specific applications. Laboratory research c onducted in somatic ce lls and non-heritable laboratory research in human germ cells, gametes, or early-stage embryos is covered in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 examines the uses of genome editing for somatic interventions focused on therapy, including fetal therapy. Chapter 5 addresses th e use of genome-editing technology in germline cells for potential research and cl inical therapeutic applications in human patients. Chapter 6 considers the potential use of human genome editi ng to enhance human functions rather than to treat or prevent dis ease or disability. The subsequent chapter (Chapter 7) turns from analysis of thes e categories of application to the role of public input in determining how genome-editing technology should be governed in the future, both in the United States and in other countries. The ch apter considers public engagement for different categories of genome-e diting applications and explores strengths and limitations of potential models for un dertaking such public engagement. Finally, Chapter 8 returns to the set of overarc hing principles and th e responsibilities that flow from them in the context of human genom e editing. The chapter pulls together the report's conclusions and recommendations in li ght of these fundamental concepts. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

That framework is embedded within the larger contex t of internati onal conventions and norms for protection of hu man rights and, more specificall y, for research involving human subjects and clinical care. From these international instruments, one can derive principles for governance of genome editing that have general a pplication within the Un ited States and across the globe, and are reflected in the specific stat utory and regulatory ru les that are adopted by various nations. This chapter begins by describing the overa rching principles for human genome editing adopted by the committee for this study, which are informed by those international instruments and national rules, and which in turn inform th e conclusions and recommendations presented in this report. It then provides an in-depth look at U.S. governance of gene transfer research and therapy, and a brief review of alternate approach es used in other countries (some of which are explored in greater depth in A ppendix B). Conclusions regarding th e adequacy of U.S. oversight systems to deal with the specific technical and et hical issues raised by genome editing appear in Chapters 3 through 6. PRINCIPLES FOR GOVERNANCE OF HUMAN GENOME EDITING Louis Pasteur once said: \"La science n'a pas pa que le savoir est le patrimoine de l'humanit\u00e9\" (Science has no homeland, because know ledge is the heritage of humanity). But while science is global, it proceeds within a vari ety of political systems and cultural norms. It is important to identify principles that can tr anscend these differences and divisions, while accommodating cultural diversity. This is no easy task. Achieving consensus around overarching ethical principles to undergird specific recommendations for ac tion can be difficult, whether because no one theory of ethics has been accepte d by philosophers and theologians or because no one algorithm for deriving principles from those theories has been found. Utilitarians may agree on the need to evaluate overall beneficial cons equences, but may disagree on whether to evaluate the consequences of a rule or of a specific act. Deontologists not only will struggl e to derive a defensible list of fundamental rule s of behavior, but also will be c onfronted with specific cases in 12Portions of this chapter were adapted and updated from Institute of Medicine (IOM, 2014) and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM, 2016e).

Other theories suffer from similar complications. Bioethics, as a form of applied ethics, has su ffered from all these complexities. It has also been dogged by long-standing debates about whethe r the best approach is high theory, from which all principles and specifi c actions flow, or anti-theory, in which deductive reasoning from specific cases leads to generalizab le principles. And when bioethic s is incorporated into public policy making, as opposed to individual clinical et hics analyses, it is nece ssary to incorporate a wider range of concerns about multicultural ci vil society, theories of democracy, and just distribution of burdens and benefits.13 Regardless of whether reasoning be gins with theories grounded in utilitarian consequentialism or deontology or virtue ethics , there has emerged over time what some deem \"reflective equilibrium.\" This concept encompasses the us e of both inductive a nd deductive reasoning, incorporating both theory and case-based casuist ry, and accepting the need for reasoning that is understandable to the public, rega rdless of individual spiritual or religious orie ntation (Arras, 2016). It has helped shape influe ntial statements and guidance documents across the globe. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (U N, 1948), adopted shortly after World War II, became the foundational document for many of the mo re particularized declarations, conventions, and treaties that followed. In its preamble, it states that \"recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world,\" a nd its very first provision reads, \"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.\" Other international documents build on this core principle. The Convention on Rights of the Child, for example, calls for providing conditions for optimal development, such as health care and sani tation (UNICEF, 1990). And the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities emphasizes \"r espect for inherent dignity,\" \"respect for difference and acceptance of persons with disabilitie s as part of human di versity and humanity,\" and \"respect for the evolving capacities of childre n with disabilities and respect for the right of children with disabilities to preserve their iden tities\" (UN, 2006). Not every convention is legally binding in whole or part on every country, but even wher e not incorporated into domestic statutes or applied in domestic court cases, the principles underlying th ese conventions have become important elements of global norms and aspirations. Other international activ ities are focused more closely on biomedical research. The Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) is an international, nongovernmental, nonprofit entity established in 1949 jointly by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Educational, Sc ientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), whose members include nearly 50 organizations\u2014pr ofessional societies, national academies, research councils\u2014from across the globe. Among ot her things, it issues international guidelines for health research14 based on such guidance documents as the World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki (WMA , 2013) and UNESCO's (2005) Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights. The 2016 version of the guide lines (van Delden and van der Graaf, 2016) stresses \"the need for research having scientif ic and social value, by providing special guidelines for health-related research in low-resource sett ings, by detailing the provisions for involving vulnerable groups in research and for describi ng under what conditions biological samples and health-related data can be used for research\" (CIOMS, 2012). Of particular relevance to genome- 13Further discussion of these issues can be found in Arras (2016). 14See http://www.cioms.ch (accessed January 5, 2017).

Also of particular relevance is Guideline 7 on public engagement, needed not only to deve lop and legitimize good policy but also to help translate research into clinical benefit. In the United States, the landmark 1979 Belmont Report of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects in Biomedical and Behavioral research (HHS, 1979) focused on avoiding infliction of harm, accep ting a duty of beneficence, and maintaining a commitment to justice. These pillars of research ethics have been interpreted, expande d, deepened, and applied over the years and incorporated into the U.S. system for governing research with human participants (21 CFR Part 50 and 45 CFR Part 46). In practice, they have resulted in a focus on ensuring a reasonable balance between risk and hoped-for benefits, to the individual and to society, and on ensuring that both risks and benef its are equitably shared. These principles also have come to incorporate particul ar attention to the need for re spect of individual autonomy, in the form of generally requiring informed and vol untary participation, and the need to provide special protection against coercion or abuse of those who are vulner able because of incapacity or circumstances. Because both the science and the applications of genome editing will transcend national boundaries, the core principles for governance of human genome detailed below build on the foundations of these internationa l and national norms. Some of these principles are generally relevant to biomedical research and care, while ot hers are of particular importance in the context of an emerging technology, but all are foundationa l for the governance of human genome editing. In this context, the committee focused on pr inciples that are aimed at protecting and promoting the health and well-being of individua ls; approaching novel tec hnologies with evolvi ng information; respecting indi vidual rights; guarding against unwanted societal effects; and equitably di stributing information, burdens, and benefits. Differences in social and legal culture inevit ably will lead to different domestic policies governing specific applications of genome editing. Nonetheless, some principles can be shared across national borders. Thus, while the overarching principles pres ented here are aimed primarily at the U.S. government, they a nd the responsibilities th at underlie them are universal in nature. The principles are listed in B ox 2-1 and elaborated below. BOX 2-1 Overarching Principles for Research on and Clinical Applications of Human Gene Editing Genome editing holds great promise for deepening understanding of biology and for preventing, ameliorating, or e liminating many human diseases and conditions. Along with this promise comes the need for responsible and ethically appropriate approaches to research and clinical use. The following general principles are essential foundations for those approaches: 1. Promoting well-being 2. Transparency 3. Due care 4. Responsible science 5. Respect for persons 6. Fairness 7. Transnational cooperation Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 24 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION 1. Promoting well-being: The principle of promoting well -being supports providing benefit and preventing harm to those affected, often referre d to in the bioethics literature as the principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence. Responsibilities that flow from adherence to th is principle include (1 ) pursuing applications of human genome editing that promote the health and well-being of individuals, such as treating or preventing disease, while minimizing risk to individuals in early a pplications with a high degree of uncertainty; and (2) ensuring a reas onable balance of risk and benefit for any application of human genome editing. 2. Transparency: The principle of transparency re quires openness and sharing of information in ways that are acces sible and understandable to stakeholders. Responsibilities that flow from adherence to this principle include (1) a commitment to disclosure of information to the fullest ex tent possible and in a timely manner, and (2) meaningful public input into the policy-making pr ocess related to human genome editing, as well as other novel and disr uptive technologies. 3. Due care: The principle of due care for patients en rolled in research studies or receiving clinical care requires proceeding carefull y and deliberately, and only when supported by sufficient and robust evidence. Responsibilities that flow from adherence to th is principle include pr oceeding cautiously and incrementally, under appropriate supervision and in ways that allow for frequent reassessment in light of future advances and cultural opinions. 4. Responsible science: The principle of responsible sc ience underpins adherence to the highest standards of research, from bench to bedside, in a ccordance with in ternational and professional norms. Responsibilities that flow from adherence to this principle include a commitment to (1) high- quality experimental design and analysis, (2) appr opriate review and eval uation of protocols and resulting data, (3) transparency, and (4) correc tion of false or misleading data or analysis. 5. Respect for persons: The principle of respect for pe rsons requires recognition of the personal dignity of all indivi duals, acknowledgment of the cen trality of personal choice, and respect for individual decisions. All people have equal moral value, regardless of their genetic qualities. Responsibilities that flow from adherence to th is principle include (1 ) a commitment to the equal value of all individuals, (2) respect for and promotion of individual decision making, (3) a commitment to preventing recurrence of the abusiv e forms of eugenics practiced in the past, and (4) a commitment to destigmatizing disability. 6. Fairness: The principle of fairness requires that li ke cases be treated a like, and that risks and benefits be equitably distri buted (distributive justice). Responsibilities that flow from adherence to th is principle include (1 ) equitable distribution of the burdens and benefits of research and (2 ) broad and equitable acces s to the benefits of resulting clinical applicati ons of human genome editing. 7. Transnational cooperation: The principle of transnati onal cooperation supports a commitment to collaborative approaches to rese arch and governance while respecting different cultural contexts. Responsibilities that flow from adherence to this principle include (1) respect for differing national policies, (2) coordination of regulatory st andards and procedures whenever possible, and (3) transnational collaboration and data shar ing among different scientific communities and responsible regulatory authorities.

REGULATION OF GENE THERAPY IN THE UNITED STATES Both somatic and germline human genome editing would be regulated in the United States within the framework for gene transfer resear ch and, once approved, for gene therapy, which applies to work with human tissues and cells from the early stages of labo ratory research through preclinical testing, human clini cal trials, approval for introduc tion into medical therapy and postapproval surveillance. At the national level, regulation may be mandatory in all cases\u2014for example, when the work is to be submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval\u2014or it can be mandatory only for those who are using federal f unds. Oversight also can proceed according to voluntary self-regulation purs uant to professional guidelines. In addition to national rules, individual states have at times issued rules on specific topics, such as embryo research, or attached restrictions to the use of state funds, such as for embryonic stem cell work. As a result, unlike some jurisdic tions, such as the United Kingdom, in which work with embryos generally falls under a single statutory framew ork or regulatory body, the United States has individual rules related to stage of work and source of funding that overl ap and interact in a manner that, in the end, provides fairly comprehensive coverage. In general, laboratory work is subject to local oversight by institutional biosafety committees (IBCs) whose focus is on safety, and in many cas es to federal oversight for quality assurance under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments as well.15 In some cases, laboratory work using cells from identifiabl e living donors also is subject to review by institutional review boards (IRBs), whose focus is on protecting donors from the effects of being identified, and on ensuring appropriate informed consent. Labor atory work using human embryos does not fall within IRB jurisdiction unless the progenitor-don ors are identifiable, but this work may be overseen by voluntary oversight bodies, such as embryonic stem cell research oversight committees (ESCROs) created pursuant to NAS/I OM recommendations or the embryo research oversight committees (EMROs) recently creat ed pursuant to recommendations of the International Society for Stem Ce ll Research (ISSCR, 2016a). Preclinical animal work is subject to regulation and oversight by institutional animal care and use committees pursuant to the Animal Welfare Act. Clinical trials may be th e subject of discussion and advisory protocol review by the National Institu tes of Health (NIH) Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC), but will nonetheless require approval by an IRB and permission from the FDA. Human genome editing technologies are considered to be gene therapies with regard to FDA oversight, and the agency regulates human genome editing under the existing framework for biological products, which includes gene therapy products. The FDA has authorized a number of gene therapy trials but has not yet approved a ge ne therapy for market. If one is approved, it will still be subject to the FDA's ongoing monitoring a nd, if necessary, restrictions on their use.

All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 26 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION FDA oversight entails review under rules govern ing biologics and, in many cases, under rules governing drugs. Once gene therapies are introduced into clin ical care, not only will the FDA maintain surveillance to detect safety c oncerns, but formal studies of the labeled uses also may be conducted to take a fresh look at the safety and efficacy of the therapy. Postmarket use may also encompass uses that go beyond the indications fo r which a therapy was approved. Formal studies of an approved biologic for a use other than sp ecified in the labeling would generally not be considered off-label use and would require FDA oversight. But outside of a study, \"off label\" use in clinical care is entirely legal, and has become a common practice among physicians with respect to drugs, and might be available for a gene transfer product using genome editing once it is approved. Physicians use their own expertise a nd sources of information, as well as the advice of professional societies. They ar e regulated at the state level by their licensing and disciplinary bodies, may be limited by availability of patients' insurance coverage fo r novel interventions, and are constrained by the prospect of tort liabilit y for medical malpractice should they be deemed negligent or reckless. Table 2-1 provides a summary of the major step s in the anticipated regulatory pathway for the development of a new medical product create d using genome editing. The individual steps and considerations listed in this table are discu ssed in greater detail in the remainder of the chapter.

For most cells and tissues, an initial question is whether the donor can re ceive any kind of payment, in cash or kind. This has been a particularly sensitive issue with respect to gametes used in res earch, with debate being focused less on the ethics of research using gametes and mo re on the ethics of how they are obtained and whether it involves anything that resembles undue inducement. For embryos and fetal tissue, rules are influenced by broader legal regime s governing human reproduction and products of conception, to the extent such re gimes exist in a given country. A nd for all tissues, attention is given to whether the tissue is obtained with required permissions from the donor and whether its use poses any risk to the donor's privacy. These rules can change , of course, when tissue is obtained from cadavers rather than live donors. In the United States, human tissue is donated for research in various ways. Rules governing that donation depend on several factor s, the most important of which are whether the tissue is left over from a clinical procedure or is being obtained through a ne w intervention specifically for research, and whether the resulti ng tissue specimen has information attached to it that makes the donor's identity readily ascertainable. When tissu e is collected through a physical intervention (such as a blood draw) specifically for resear ch, the donor is a human subject, and an IRB Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 28 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION oversees the recruitment of donors, the procedur es used for collection, and the information provided to obtain consent.16 However, as discussed below, merely giving consent to use of already excised tissue does not render the donor a human subject, unless the tissue has information that makes the donor's id entity readily ascertainable. Once the tissue has been obtained, it is availabl e for laboratory research, subject to the usual rules for oversight of recombinant DNA research by IBCs. This pattern of regulation is the same regardless of whether genome editing will be carried out on the tissues. Recombinant DNA Research and Institutional Biosafety Committees Research with human tissues and cells that ta kes place entirely within a laboratory and does not involve either prec linical testing on nonhuman animals or clinical testing on humans is subject to regulations and requirements, many fo cused primarily on ensuring the safety of the laboratory environment for workers. For experiments subject to the NIH Guidelines for Research involving Recombinant or Synt hetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (NIH Guidelines ), there is a requirement that the research be reviewed a nd approved by an Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC). The NIH Guidelines are applicable to all research that is conducted at or sponsored by an institution that receive NIH funding for such research, however many institutions follow the requirements of the NIH Guidelines even when they are not requi red. IBCs review nearly all forms of research utilizing recombinant (or synthetic) nucleic acid molecules at the local institutional level (e.g., university or research center). The IBCs ensure research is conducted in conformity with the biosafety provisions of the NIH Guidelines , and assess the research for potential risks to human health and the envir onment. This biosafety review is accomplished by assessing the appropriate physical and biological containment for the research and ensuring the researchers are adequately trained to conduct the work they are proposing safely. An IBC is required to have at least five memb ers with expertise in recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule technology, at least two of whom are inde pendent of the institution at which the research is being conducted. The NIH Guidelines encourage institutions to open IBC meetings to the public when possible and when consistent with the protection of privacy and proprietary interests (NIH, 2013c). The NIH Guidelines also require institutions to make IBC meeting minutes available to the public upon request. Human Tissue Use and Institutional Review Boards Laboratory-based research using human tissue may also trigger certain human subjects protections, even though all the wo rk is done in vitro. Two situati ons trigger this additional level of regulation. First, as noted above, if the ti ssue is being collected from a liv ing individual, specifically for research, this interaction generally will be s ubject to oversight by an IRB. Although IRBs are designed primarily to protect the ri ghts and welfare of research subjects in clinical investigations, the act of collecting tissue for research is considered to re nder the donor a research subject, even if subsequent work with the tissue will yield no in formation that could be traced to or in any way affect the donor. 16Donating embryos or fetal tissue remaining after miscarriage or abortion does not render the donor a human subject unless identifying information about the donor is retained and insufficiently obscured. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Additional Rules Governing Laboratory Research on Human Gametes and Embryos Basic science research on genome editing may entail experimentati on on human gametes and embryos, with no intention of performing intraute rine transfer to esta blish a pregnancy in a woman (see Chapter 3). Indeed, such in vitro research on embryos has already proceeded in China (using nonviable embryos) and has been a pproved (with viable embryos) by the relevant regulatory bodies in Sweden and the United King dom. Work also is pr oceeding on understanding human germ cell development, research in whic h genome editing is one of many tools that can be used to explore the roles of specific genes (Irie et al., 2015). This laboratory research might take a number of forms, each rais ing slightly different ethical and legal issues. First, it might involve editing somatic tissue in such a way that gametes would or might also be affected. Second, it might i nvolve editing an existing gamete or gamete progenitor, such as a spermatogonial stem cell, in vitro or in vivo. Third, it might involve editing an egg in the process of fertil ization (e.g., during intracytoplasmic sperm injection), or editing an already fertilized e gg (zygote) or embryo. 20\"By \"secondary research,\" this exemption is referring to re-using identifiable information and identifiable biospecimens that are collected for some other \"primary\" or \"initial\" activity. The information or biospecimens that are covered by this exemption would generally be found by the investigator in some type of records (in the case of information) or some type of tissue repository (such as a hospital's department for storing clinical pathology specimens).\" Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects; Final Rule Federal Register, Vol. 82, no. 12 (January 19, 2017), pp. 7149-7274 at p. 7191.

Should ther e be a clinical trial involving efforts to gestate the edited reproductive materials, the research would come under FDA jurisdiction, and approval of an Investig ational New Drug (IND) application would be required prior to beginning each such trial (see Ch apter 5 for discussion of such potential future applications). In the United States, the public policy issues surrounding laboratory research with human embryos were debated extensively by the 1994 NIH Human Embryo Research Panel, which was convened to provide recommendations to the Ad visory Committee to the NIH director. Its conclusions, reflect the view that embryos should be regarded as different from ordinary human tissue but nonetheless be used for some areas of research if in th e service of important scientific knowledge that cannot be obtained with less co ntroversial methods. In addition, the panel's report called for the use of human embryos at th e earliest stages and in the smallest numbers consistent with needs of the research. Except in very limited circumstances, the panel called for use of only those embryos that, a lthough originally created in the c ourse of a reproductive effort, now would otherwise be discarde d. Donation to research would re quire the informed consent of those who had created the embryos for reproduct ive purposes (NIH, 1994). While technically the panel's report addressed conditions for federal funding of research that uses human embryos (which was subsequently pr ohibited by congressional action21), its recommendations came to be recognized within the sc ientific community as a more gene ral evaluation of the ethics and acceptability of such research. Regulatory protections for human research su bjects do not apply to the ex vivo embryo.22 Nonetheless, many (if not most) institutions housing embryonic stem cell research have put voluntary oversight measures in place (Dever eaux and Kalichman, 2013), and the International Society for Stem Cell Research recently adopted guidelines calling for expanding these oversight committees to almost all research involving hum an embryos, regardless of whether stem cells will be derived and regardless of funding source (ISSCR, 2016). Some preclinical research on germline genom e editing would likely take advantage of embryos left over from reproductive attempts using in vitro fertilization (IVF). Although no official numbers are available, a conservative estimate indicates that more than one million embryos, most of them produced but ultimately not used for IVF, remain in storage across the United States (Lomax and Trounson, 2013), with many more being stored around the world. As noted earlier, U.S. federal funding for research on embryos generally is prohibited. The work can, however, be supported with funds from indivi dual states and private sources, often with policies similar to those proposed by the 1994 embryo research panel. California, for example, has been funding embryo research and embryonic stem cell research fo r a decade using funds from a state bond issued during th e years when federal funding was limited to a small number of older embryonic stem cell lines. Connecticut, Ma ryland, New Jersey, and New York also created funds for research that could not be federally funded (NIH, 2016c). 21The Dickey-Wicker Amendment prohibits the use of most federal funds for re search that invo lves creating or destroying embryos, and for research th at puts embryos at risk of injury or destruction except when necessary to increase their chance for healthy development. The amendment has been attached to the annual appropriations bills for the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Education since 1996. 22Other rules, particularly state laws governing research using embryos, may apply (see Chapter 5).

All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 32 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION Genome-editing research that generates human gametes from pluripotent stem cells would not be governed by the laws or funding policies governing embryo research unless a fertilized egg would be made in order to test the gametes. A single-cell fertilized egg is treated as if it were an embryo for most relevant state and federal laws, and restrictions on the work or on the funding would apply. In addition, such a step would constitute making an embryo solely for research purposes (that is, without any intent to gestate the embryo and br ing a fetus to term), and this has remained the most controversial form of embryo research in the United States. Some of those opposed to making embryos in research ar gue that fertilization brings a new, morally significant human being into existence, and th at making embryos for research purposes is inherently disrespectful of human life and pot entially open to signifi cant abuses (NIH, 1994, p. 42). In some cases, this reasoning is extended to encompass totipotent cells made with somatic cell nuclear transfer (\"cloning\"). Even those w ho do not accord full moral status to an embryo might be wary of creating embr yos for research (Green, 1994; The Washington Post , 1994). On the other hand, the panel concluded that maki ng embryos is justified when \"the research by its very nature cannot otherwise be validly co nducted\" or when it is necessary for a study that is \"potentially of outstanding scientific and therapeutic value\" (NIH, 1994, p. 45). This would appear to include research on in vitro-deri ved gametes and on techniques for avoiding mitochondrial disease, neither of which were on the immediate horizon for human application at the time of the Human Embryo Research Panel re port. The genome-editing research necessary to test edited gametes would seem to fall within this exception, as woul d the introduction of genome-editing components along with sperm duri ng IVF procedures such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Among those coun tries that permit research on human embryos, rules differ on whether this exception also w ould permit making embryos specifi cally for research (UNESCO, 2004b). Oversight in Other Nations for Research Using Human Embryos As noted earlier, in the United States, a handful of states have laws governing or forbidding research using human embryos (NCSL, 2016). At the federal level, there is no prohibition on such research, although there are limits on the us e of federal funds to perform the research. By contrast, much of what is permitted in th e United States would be more tightly regulated in the United Kingdom, where research on human gametes and embryos is subject to review by the Human Fertilisation and Embr yology Authority and a license is required for each specific set of experiments. (See Chapter 5 for discussion of clinical use of germ line editing.). In other countries, such as Chile,23 Germany (DRZE, 2016), Italy (Boggio, 2005), Lithuania,24 and Slovakia,25 the research would not be le gal under any regulatory regime. This variation in governance approaches reflects the fact that research with gametes, and in particular with embryos, has been controversia l in many countries. Views on the legal and moral 23Chile, Congreso Nacional, Sobre la investigacion cientifi ca humano, su genoma, y prohibe la clonacion humana, September 22, 2006, no. 20.120, art. 1, Witherspoon Council staff translation, http://www.leychile.cl/N avegar?idNorma=253478 [Spanish ] (accessed January 4, 2017) 24Lithuania, Seimas, Law on Ethics of Biomedical Research, no.

These views vary both among and within countries and reflect both religious a nd secular influences. The result has been public policies ranging from permissive, to regulate d, to prohibitionist. While genome editing is a powerful new tec hnology for making genetic modifications in cells, its use in the context of research on human embryos raises issues essentially the same as those discussed in the past: the moral status of the embryo, the acceptability of making embryos for research or using embryos that would othe rwise be discarded, and the legal or voluntary limits that apply to the use of embryos in re search (CIRM, 2015; ISSCR, 2016; NIH, 2016). This report does not address those ethical arguments , and accepts as given the current legal and regulatory policies that apply in ea ch country. If any of those gene ral policies were to change in the future, genome-editing research would be affected as well. Research Using Nonhuman Animals The 1966 Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2131), th e federal law covering the use of animals in research, regulates testing and maintenance of a number of species, although notably not some of those which are most commonly used, such as rats and mice. It is enforced by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Animal a nd Plant Health Inspection Service, and at the local level requires that research institutions establish an institutional animal care and use committee \"to oversee and evaluate all aspects of the institution's animal care and use program,\" such as ensuring that the standards for physical containmen t and pain minimization are met. If genome editing research at a ny point were to require the cr eation of chimeric organisms, funding from NIH would come with rules limitin g certain combinations (NIH, 2015a). NIH has recently requested public comment on proposed changes to provisions relevant to chimeras in its guidelines for human stem cell research, incl uding work that involves chimeras (NIH, 2016). Clinical Trials of Human Geno me Editing\u2014The Role of IRBs Clinical genome-editing trials \u2014that is, studies involving hum an subjects\u2014cannot commence without permission from the FDA, the details of which are discussed below. Along with FDA review, three other bodies\u2014IRBs, IBCs, and the RAC\u2014have clinical trial oversight responsibilities for genome editing. IRB review and approval focuses on the risks an d benefits of a clin ical study and on the manner in which people are recruited for the stud y. It is required for any research involving human subjects that is supporte d by the U.S. Department of H ealth and Human Services (HHS) or regulated by the FDA. It is also required for research conduc ted or supported by any of the other federal agencies subscribing to the Co mmon Rule, for research on products regulated by the FDA, and for research conducted by investig ators at any institution that has voluntarily extended these protections to res earch that is otherwise not subj ect to these rules. The Common Rule addresses research with liv ing individuals, and some federa l funding agencies have adopted additional rules specifically with respect to resear ch with fetuses. Research on embryos, as noted earlier, is regulated separate ly by some states and through federal funding restrictions. IRBs have the authority to approve or deny a pproval for research protocols, human subject recruitment plans, and informed consent documen ts. They also may require modifications to a protocol as a condition of appr oval. IRBs also oversee amendm ents to ongoing studies and can Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 34 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION suspend studies proving to be problematic\u2014for exam ple, due to the rate or severity of adverse events. In this task, IRBs may be assisted by data and safety mon itoring boards, designed to track interim data while a study is ongoing. They provide additional expert and independent review to help ensure that a study continues to meet the standard for a reasonable balance of risks and potential benefits and that the information provi ded during initial recruitment of subjects remains a fair reflection of their risks and benefits as additional information is obtained during the study. Federal regulations do not spec ify whether an IRB must hold open meetings or make its minutes and other documents available to the public; these are matters for individual institutional policies or state law. But an IRB, in addition to including experts with appropriate technical training, must include at least one member whose primary concern is in a nonscientific area and one lay member who is not otherwise affiliated with the institution. In addition, an IRB has the discretion to invite individuals with competence in special areas to assist in the review of complex issues. Federal regulations require an I RB to determine that risks to research subjects are minimized and are reasonable in relation to the potential benefits to the s ubjects and the importance of the knowledge that may be expected to result from the research. They are also required to ensure that selection of subjects is equitable and that subjec ts are freely volunteering for the research with sufficient information. In pediatric protocols, risk tolerance is lowe r. If benefit to the child is possible, the research may proceed with the cons ent of one parent and risk tolerance will be geared to the potential benefits. But if the res earch offers no prospect of medical benefit, the child may not be exposed to more than a \"minor increment over minimal risk\" absent special intervention by the secretary of HHS. When research is done on fetuses, certain fede ral funders insist on sp ecial provisions related to the degree of risk that is permitted and to how (and from whom) consent must be sought (Subpart B 45 CFR 46); while not required, these same provisions may be adopted by investigators who use other funds. These provisions st ate that risk to the fe tus is tolerated when it has been minimized to the extent possible and wh en it is balanced by the prospect of direct benefit for the pregnant woman or the fetus. If ther e is no such prospect of benefit, the risk to the fetus may not be greater than minimal, and the pu rpose of the research mu st be the development of important biomedical knowledge that cannot be obtained by any other means. Consent by the pregnant woman is sufficient when the research holds the prospect of benefit to her as well as the fetus. If the research holds the prospect of be nefit only to the fetus a nd not to the pregnant woman herself, then paternal consen t is also required, if feasible. Requiring voluntary and informed consent is on e of the key protections for human subjects. The elements, as listed in HHS re gulations include among other items: 1. An explanation of the purposes of the rese arch, the procedures that will be used and whether any procedures are experimental; 2. A description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or benefits to the subject or to others; 3. A disclosure of appropriate alternative procedures; 4. A statement describing the extent, if any, to which confidentiality will be maintained; 5. For research involving more than minimal risk, an explanation as to whether any compensation and medical treatments are available in case of injury; and Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

A statement that participation is voluntary, re fusal to participate will involve no penalty and that the subject may disconti nue participation at any time.26 First-in-human trials make compliance with these provisions diffi cult, given that by definition, it is very difficult to assess the degree of uncertainty that pert ains when research is moving from preclinical models to human interv entions. Nonetheless, such trials must take place, and IRBs work to ensure that subjects understand not only what is known from preclinical work but also appreciate the exis tence of knowledge gaps that will affect the extent to which the outcome of the trials can be predicted. The federal rules include a provision stating that an \"IRB should not consider possible long- range effects of applying knowledge gained in th e research (for example, the possible effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility.\" This provision therefore excludes from I RBs the power to withhold approval of a study solely because the knowledge it produces or the policies it affects may be socially controversial or because of fears that the study will represent the be ginning of a slippery slope to future applications that are c ontroversial. The provision does, however, allow IRBs to withhold approval of a study because it may cause physical , psychological, or emotional harm to the subjects. Clinical Trials of Human Genome Editing: The Role of the R ecombinant DNA Advisory Committee The late 1960s and early 1970s saw the rapid pr ogression of the concepts and technology that led to the first intentional cr eation of recombinant DNA molecule s (Berg and Mertz, 2010). The RAC was established by then-NIH Director Donald Frederickson in 1974 in response to scientific, public, and political concerns about the potential us e and misuse of recombinant DNA technologies, as well as the associated known and unknown risks. The proposed RAC membership included requirements designed to ensu re a broader public perspective, such as a diverse membership that included scientists, clinic ians, ethicists, biosafety experts, theologians and public representatives, among others, et c. Over time, the RAC's membership and responsibilities have evolved in response to scientific developments and shifting public concerns. Early actions by the RAC included requiring th at every research institution create a biohazard review committee (later renamed an IBC) to review ri sks and certify the presence of adequate safety measures. The major initial task of the RAC was the drafting of guidelines for recombinant DNA research that, while lacking th e legal force of regulations, have had an enormous influence on practices for preventing th e unintended release of or human exposure to genetically modified organisms and material (Rainsbury, 2000). The guidelines are a term and condition of NIH funding, and are applicable to all recombinant DNA research that is conducted or sponsored by a public or private institution th at receives NIH funding for any such research (NIH, 2013a). Many other U.S. government agencies and private institutions require that their funded research be conducted in accordance w ith the NIH Guidelines (Corrigan-Curay, 2013). Initially, the RAC reviewed and approved all pr oposals for gene-transfer research protocols to be performed at institutions receiving NI H funds for recombinant DNA research, and advised 26Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects; Final Rule.

Over time, the interplay between RAC review and FDA review ha s evolved. The RAC's initial focus on safety broadened over time to include providing a venue for discussion of social and ethical issues. In the mid-1990s, the FDA assumed sole authority to a pprove gene transfer rese arch protocols, with some protocols selected for in-depth review and public discussion by an initial review by RAC members. Provision was also made for a comp assionate use exemption process (Rainsbury, 2000; Wolf, 2009). Appendix M of the NIH Guidelines is a \"Poi nts to Consider\" document that details the requirements for human gene-transfer protocol submission and reporting and review by the RAC (NIH, 2013c). The NIH Guidelines state that the \"NIH will not at present entertain proposals for germline alteration.\" With regard to in utero gene transfer, the NIH Guidelines state that the NIH may be willing to consider such research but only after significant additional preclinical and clinical studies satisfy criteria developed at a RAC conferen ce. In April 2015, the NIH Director issued a statement that \"the NIH will not fund any use of gene editi ng technologies in human embryos.\" Within the entire system of oversight for ge ne-transfer research, the RAC provides a forum for the in-depth review and public discussion of a protocol. The IRBs convene in private, although, as noted earlier, they do include nonscientists as members. The public nature of the RAC is due to its status as a public adviso ry committee under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) of 1972. To comply with FACA re gulations, the RAC must hold open meetings, giving advance notice of the time and place; prov ide minutes; and allow for public participation (Steinbrook, 2004). The RAC also sponsors public symposia on importa nt scientific and policy issues related to recombinant DNA research (Friedmann et al., 20 01), providing a public forum for scientific, clinical, ethics, and safety expert s along with the public to discuss emerging issues in the field of gene transfer. Along with the RAC's protocol re view and mechanisms for informing institutional oversight bodies, this transparent system is intended to optimize th e conduct of individual research protocols and to advance gene-transfer research generally (O'Reilly et al., 2012). In this way, the RAC serves as an important channel fo r scientific debate, informing institution-level oversight, increasing transparency, and promoting pub lic trust and confidence in the field of gene transfer. In April 2016, amendments to the NIH Guidelin es for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecu les (NIH, 2016a) went into effect. Under the revised NIH Guidelines, which reflected many of the reco mmendations of an IOM study (IOM, 2014), individual human gene-transfer trials are limited to cases in which the NIH concurs with a request from an oversight body (such as an IRB or an IBC) that has determined that a protocol would significantly benefit from RA C review and has met one or more of the following criteria: \"The protocol uses a new vector, genetic material, or delivery methodology that represents a first-in-human experien ce, thus presenting an unknown risk. The protocol relies on preclinical safety data that were obtained us ing a new preclinical model system of unknown and unconfirmed value. The proposed vector, gene construct, or met hod of delivery is associated with possible toxicities that are not wide ly known and that may render it difficult for oversight bodies involved to evaluate the protoc ol rigorously\" (IOM, 2014, p. 4).

All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance OVERSIGHT OF HUMAN GENOME EDITING 37 PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION Human gene-transfer protocols may also be reviewed by the RAC if the NIH director determines that the research presents significan t scientific, societal, or ethical concerns. The RAC has reviewed several protocols involving th e three major gene editing technologies, and certain human gene-editing protocols, at this earl y stage of development, would be expected to meet these criteria. Public Engagement Under the Auspices of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee Public review of protocols for gene-transfe r research is intended (1) to disseminate information so that other scientists can in corporate new scientific findings and ethical considerations into thei r research, and (2) to enhance public awareness of and build public trust in such research, allowing for a public voice in the review of th e research (Scharschmidt and Lo, 2006). According to NIH's Office of Science Polic y (OSP), protocol review by the RAC serves many functions (Corrigan-Curay, 2013), including optimizing clinical trial design and increasing safety for research subjects, and in some instances strengthening biosaf ety protections necessary fo r researchers, health care workers, and close contacts of research subjects; improving the efficiency of gene therapy re search by allowing scientists to build on a common foundation of new knowledge emanati ng from a timely, transparent analytic process; and informing the deliberations of the FDA, th e NIH Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP), IRBs, IBCs, and other oversight bodies whose approval is necessary for gene therapy research projects to be undertaken. The current process aims to be highly transp arent. The OSP website provides information about protocols and the public discussions at the RAC meetings , and the protocols themselves are made available to members of the public upon request (OBA, 2013) . All correspondence between the RAC and investigators also is part of the public record for the protocol and is available to the investigators, sponsor(s), IRB(s), IBC(s), the F DA, and OHRP (NIH, 2013a). For protocols selected for in-depth review and public discussion, the protocol registration process is defined as complete when, following the review, the investigator receiv es a letter based on the recommendations discussed at the RAC meeting. The letter is also sent to the relevant IRB(s) and IBC(s) (NIH, 2013b). Minutes an d webcasts of the RAC meetings are made available on the RAC's public website. Neither investigators nor I RBs or IBCs are required to follow any of the RAC's recommendations. Rather, a protocol's approval comes from a collection of other regulatory bodies. A protocol mu st be approved by the relevant IBC(s) and IRB(s) before research participants can be en rolled in a clinical trial. Th ese bodies often rely on the RAC's recommendations in making their decisions, but the RAC's approval per se is not required for the research to move forward (Wolf et al., 2009). Th e FDA, the agency responsible for regulatory approval, also takes into account the views of the RAC when reviewing IND applications (Takefman, 2013). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Most of these products will be viewed as biologic drugs rather than devices. Thus, before being used in human trials, they will need to have FDA review and approval of their IND app lication. INDs for gene therapy are regulated by the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies (p reviously the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies) within CBER. The review fo llows a regulatory framework in which the FDA and the sponsor interact throughout the product' s life cycle, from pre-IND to postmarketing surveillance. CBER regulates a range of biol ogics, including human gene th erapy products, and certain devices related to gene transf er. The FDA defines gene ther apy products as products that \"mediat[e] their effects by transcription and/or translation of transferred genetic material and/or by integrating into the host genom e ... and [that] are administered as nucleic acids, viruses, or genetically engineered microorganisms.\" The gene ral types of gene therapy products reviewed by the FDA to date, pursuant to its authorit y under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (Public Law 75-717) and the Public Health Serv ice Act (Public Law 78-410) as amended, are nonviral vectors (plasmids), re plication-deficient (e.g., genetically microorganisms (e.g., Listeria Salmonella , E. coli ), and ex vivo genetical ly modified cells. The FDA also maintains a federal advisory committee, the \"Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee,\" that reviews and ev aluates available data related to the safety, effectiveness, and appropriate use of human ce lls, human tissues, gene-transfer therapies, and xenotransplantation products that are intended for transplantat ion, implantation, infusion, and transfer in the treatment and prevention of a broad spectrum of human diseases and in the reconstruction, repair, or replacement of tissues for various conditions. 27 The FDA process applies to all gene therapy c linical research, regardless of source of the funding. During the FDA's review of INDs and its subsequent review of major steps in the research process (e.g., movement from phase I to phase II studies), any RAC preliminary scientific and ethical review of human gene tr ansfer, as well as its public discussion of novel applications, is taken into account (Takefma n, 2013). Unlike RAC review, the FDA's review process for granting an IND to begin a gene thera py clinical trial is closed to the public. To go on the market, products need to receive approval of their Biologic Licensing Application (BLA) (21 CFR 600-680), which focuses on manufacturing information, labeling, and preclinical and clinical studies. The process for approving the BLA may include some public participation. Many first in class products are taken to an advisory committee, which typically includes members with medical and scientific expertise, as well as ethicists, industry representatives, and patient representatives. These meetings often re present the FDA's first public discussion of a new medical product, providing access to info rmation for patients, physicians and other stakeholders who observe the meeting, and to those who use the meeting transcripts made available on the agency website. Me etings are publicly announced in advance, and include public comment periods. 2751 Federal Register 23309 (1986). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance OVERSIGHT OF HUMAN GENOME EDITING 39 PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION FDA offers assistance to the research commun ity in the form of \"Points to Consider\" documents that present the curr ent thinking of FDA/CBER staff a bout important issues in gene transfer and gene therapy (FDA, 1991). These documents are inte nded to guide investigators in understanding FDA perspectives and requirements for development and testing as they prepare their IND applications. In 2015 the FDA released \"Considerations for the Design of Early-Phase Clinical Trials of Cellular and Gene Therapy Products\" (FDA, 2015b). To ensure that all regulatory requirements are met, the FDA encourages a \"pre-IND\" meeting between investigators and agency officials early in the protocol development process at which specific questions related to th e planned clinical trial design are discussed. The meeting also provides an opportunity for the di scussion of various scientific and regulatory aspects of the medical product as they relate to safety and/or potential clinical hold issues,28 such as plans for studying the gene-transfer product in pediatric populations (FDA, 2001). For the meeting, the investigator must submit an information package th at describes the structure of the gene-transfer product, its proposed clinical i ndication, dosage and administrati on; provides preclinical and clinical study descrip tions and a data summary; includes chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) information; and specifies objectiv es expected from the meeting (FDA, 2000). For certain types of protocols\u2014including those involving gene-tra nsfer products\u2014it is sometimes necessary to discu ss special issues regarding r ecombinant DNA proteins from cell- line sources, such as the adequacy of characteri zation of cells, potential contamination of cell lines, removal or inactivation of adventitious agents, or poten tial antigenicity of the product (FDA, 2015b). An investigator is expected to consider and address FDA guidance resulting from the pre-IND meeting before submitting an application for an IND. As a general rule, when reviewing IND submi ssions, the FDA balances potential benefits and risks to participants in the clinical trials (A u et al., 2012; Takefman and Bryan, 2012). Once the investigator has submitted the IND, the FDA has 30 days either to allow it proceed or to put it on clinical hold while more data are obtained from the sponsor. The application includes details on product manufacturing, safety and quality testing, and purity and potency, as well as preclinical, pharmacological, and toxicological te sting. Safety testing required specifically of gene therapy products includes (1) potential adve rse immune responses to the ex vivo transduced cells, the vector, or the transgene; (2) vector and transgene toxicities, including distri bution of the vector to germ cells in testicular and ovarian tissues; and (3) potential risks of the delivery procedure (FDA, 2012b). The clinical protocol section of the application incl udes information about phase I, II, and/or III studies, including starting dose, dose escalati on, route of administration, dosing schedules, definition of patient population (detailed entry and exclusion criteria), and safety monitoring plans. It also includes information regarding study design, including desc ription of clinical procedures, laboratory tests, or ot her measures to be used to m onitor the effects of the product. Because vectors and transgenes of gene thera py products may persist for the lifetime of the research subject, the FDA has issued guidance on observation of subjects for delayed adverse events (FDA, 2006). 28A clinical hold is an order to delay a proposed clinical investigation or suspend an ongoing investigation. Conditions for issuing a clinical hold include unreasonable ri sk to research subjects or di scovery of information that undermines confidence in the investigators or the study protocol ( Clinical Holds and Requests for Modification , 21 CFR, Sec. 312.42 [April 1, 2016]).

This applies to many clin ical trials of drug produc ts (including biological products) and device products that are regulated by the FDA. Eff ective as of January 2017, there is an expanded registry with additional results data to help patients find trials.29 The goals are to enhance trial design, to prevent duplication of unsu ccessful trials, to improve the evidence base and efficiency of drug and device devel opment, and to build public trust. In accordance with statutory mandates, however, there is little or no transparency in FDA reviews during the IND stage, incl uding whether the agency is cons idering an IND for a specific product. But once the FDA has approved a license for a product, it ma y post the clinical, pharmacological, and other techni cal reviews of the product on its website (see, for example, information for Ducord, an umbilical-cord-de rived, stem cell product for use in certain transplantation procedures, as reported by Zhu and Rees [2012]). Although proprietary information is redacted from these posted review s, the clinical reviews provide considerable information about the trials.30 They may summarize early-stage discussions about trial design and assessments of whether sponsors conforme d to certain ethical and good trial practice standards. When necessary, the FDA can enga ge its Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to receiv e public input on a pressing is sue of broad applicability. The FDA's Sentinel Initiative\u2014launched in 200 8 to establish a national risk identification and analysis system using electronic health care data to monitor the safety of drugs, biologics, and devices after they have reached the mark et\u2014complements the Adverse Event Reporting System. Through Sentinel, the FDA can access information from electronic health records, insurance claims data and registries, and other so urces using a process that also maintains patient privacy. CBER has launched several projects wi thin Sentinel aimed at improving postlicensure safety surveillance of vaccines and other biologi cs. In addition to monitoring, other postmarket quality control measures include registries, special patient information pamphlets, and requirements for formal phase IV studies. The Eu ropean Union has its own tools for postmarket monitoring and control, differe nt in detail but similar in purpose (Borg et al., 2011). Once FDA has approved a drug, it may be prescr ibed for uses that differ from those for which it was approved and labeled. As noted earlier, such off-label prescribing is legal and a common practice of health care providers when they deem it medically appropriate for their patient. This may mean use of the product for a diffe rent medical condition from that for which it was approved (for example, approved for one kind of cancer and used for another), or its administration at different doses, in different forms, or to differ ent categories of patients. Off- label prescribing allows for physician discretion and the efficient use of information following a drug's initial approval, while still maintaining po stmarket surveillance for safety. In the United States, some areas of medicine, such as pe diatrics (AAP, 2014) a nd cancer care (American Cancer Society, 2015), are known to have a high rate of off-label use. There are a number of mechanisms by which products may follow an accelerated regulatory pathway, including Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Accelerate d Approval, and Priority 2981 Federal Register 64981-65157. 30Section 916 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendmen ts Act (2007) requires posting of certain information about a BLA approval on the FDA website.

The means used to accel erate the review range from earlier, more frequent, and more intensive cons ultations with FDA staff; to eas ing rules for the submission of materials; to changing the endpoi nts required in the study; to c onducting the review before that of other products for which the applications were submitted earlier. This provision for accelerated review was expa nded to include regenerative medicine and other cell therapy products in the 21st Century Cures Act,31 signed into law in December 2016. The act allows for approval of a \"regenerative-medicine thera py\" based on surrogate endpoints reasonably expected to predict clinical outcomes and on evidence provided by a wider range of sources, including those outside the realm of controlled clinical tr ials. Postapproval measures can still include requirements for furthe r trials, as well as surveillan ce, patient information brochures, registries, and other risk mitigation measures. This process resembles to some extent the \"conditional approval\" mechanism adopted in Japan for regenerative-medicine products, although it lacks any trigger that automatically wi thdraws approval if postmarket risk mitigation and clinical trial commitments are not fulfilled. The therapies being developed with human gene editing were not excluded from this new expanded category, and some might be eligible fo r a variety of accelerating mechanisms if they meet the definition of \"regenerative-medicine ther apy\" (which \"includes ce ll therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products \"), as well as the criterion of having the potential to fulfill an unmet n eed for a \"serious or life-thre atening disease or condition.\" Since passage of the new law, the FDA has b een working on implementing these provisions, and is considering a number of issues, including the sc ope of the products that meet the definition of regenerative medicine therapy, as specified in the legislation. 32 As written, though, the criterion of fulfilling an unmet need for a serious or life-threatening disease would seem to exclude intended uses for enhancement. 33 The Interplay Between the FDA and the NIH RAC Concern about the conduct of gene-transfer tria ls reached a new level of intensity after the 1999 death of Jesse Gelsinger, a participant in one such trial (Shalala , 2000; Steinbrook, 2002). In response, NIH took steps to coordinate reporting of adverse events and expand public access to information regarding human gene transfer trials, for example, th rough the creation of the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Info rmation System (GeMCRIS) (NIH, 2004). This database, which became operational in 2004, in cludes summary information on human gene- transfer trials registered with NIH (2004). Included in the GeMCRIS summaries is information about the medical conditions under study, inst itutions where trials are being conducted, investigators carrying out these trials, gene products being use d, and routes of gene product delivery, as well as summaries of study protocols. 3121st Century Cures Act, Public Law No. cm537670.htm (accessed January 30, 2017). 32 The FDA has also released notice of a new category, \"reg enerative advanced therapy,\" along with stipulations for the designation.

All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 42 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION Differences remain between the RAC's and the F DA's approach to oversight of gene-transfer research. The FDA, as the sole federal regulato ry agency for biomedical products in the United States, focuses on safety and efficacy when evalua ting gene-transfer products, from the first time they are used in humans through their commercial distribution (Kessler et al., 1993) and over the lifetime of their use. FDA regulation include s many steps that, by statutory provision, are confidential because of the pres ence of proprietary information (Wolf et al., 2009). In contrast, the RAC is able to address broader scientific, so cial, and ethical issues raised by gene-transfer and gene therapy research, and\u2014unlike IRBs\u2014the RAC is permitted to address these broader issues in its review of individual protocols as well (NIH, 2016b, Sec. IV-C-2-e). In addition, RAC review is conducted publicly by experts wh o are not employed by the government (Wolf et al., 2009). To encourage communication between the agenci es, the RAC charter calls for a member of CBER to be one of the nonvoting federal repres entatives to the RAC (NIH, 2011). NIH and the FDA also have harmonized reporting of adverse events. GOVERNANCE IN OTHER NATIONS As noted by former FDA Commi ssioner Robert Califf, \"[s]cien tific advances do not adhere to national boundaries and therefor e it is critical that we unde rstand the evolving views of our international counterparts.\" To that end, the F DA actively participates in the International Pharmaceutical Regulators' Forum and its Gene Therapy working group, for the purpose of exchanging technical information, and identifyi ng areas for regulatory co ordination (Califf and Nalubola, 2017). The regulatory pathways for gene therapy in ot her jurisdictions are similar to those in the United States in important ways (see Appendix B), particularly with respect to the centrality of premarket risk and benefit assessment. For exampl e, gene therapy in South Korea has a pathway very similar to that in the United States except that it includes a system of conditional approval that allows for use with less robust eviden tiary bases. The United Kingdom has rigorous premarket risk and benefit review, as in the Un ited States, but singles out therapies involving gametes or embryos for more intensive regul ation (see Box 2-2). The European Union has additional layers of quality control for \"adva nced therapy medicinal products\", which would include some gene therapy produc ts, although as in the United St ates, off-label use would be permissible (George, 2011). And Japan uses a sy stem for gene therapy products that resembles the U.S. device regulations, in which new pr oducts are sorted prospectively by level of anticipated risk and regulated accordingly. Singa pore also has adopted a risk-based approach, with such criteria as whether the manipulation is substantial or minimal; whether the intended use is homologous or nonhomologous 34; and whether it will be combined with a drug, a device, or another biologic. These criteria resemble ma ny of those used by American authorities in determining whether tissues should be subject to rules governing transpla nt medicine or rules governing the marketing of cell-therapy produc ts (Charo, 2016b). Box 2-2 illustrates the 34FDA defines homologous use as the repair, reconstruction, replacement, or supplementat ion of a recipient's cells or tissues with an HCT/P that performs the same basic function or functions in the recipient as in the donor (21 CFR 1271.3(c)), including when such cells or tissues are for autologous use.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION Genome editing holds great promise for prev enting, ameliorating, or eliminating many human diseases and conditions. Along with this promise, however, comes the need for ethically responsible research and clinical use. The existing U.S. regulatory structures discusse d in this chapter provi de a starting framework for governance of laboratory research, preclinical testing, clinical trials , and potential medical uses involving human genome editing in the United States, as well as for an understanding of differences between the U.S. system and the re gulatory infrastructure s of other nations.

All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 44 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION BOX 2-2 Example of an Alternative Governance Regime The United Kingdom serves as an example of an alternative governance regime for gene therapy. For somatic gene therapy, its approach is not unlike that in the United States, but it has more centralized and intensive regulatory control over therapies that involve gametes and embryos. For somatic gene therapy, the U.K.'s biotechnology advisory system involves interplay between the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee and t he Health and Safety Executive Scientific Advisory Committee on Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use). The U.K. Clinical Trials Regulations require that before clinical trials of gene therapy are conducted, approval must be obtained from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. Approval from the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee is also required, and additional laws and regulations govern quality control at facilities producing the cell-based therapy products (Bamford et al., 2005). Public input is sought by these regulatory agencies and by professional societies. For example, each year the Britis h Society for Gene and Cell Therapy runs a Public Engagement Day to bring students at all levels, patients, caregivers, and scientists together for discussion and debate. Once available clinically, gene therapies may be used off-label, as in the United States. With respect to the possibility of germline editing, the U.K. has a more focused and vertically integrated regulatory regime, with tighter controls over whether and when a procedure can be done, and by which professionals and clinics. Unlike the U.S. system, which has a formal \"investigational\" phase of defined uses followed by an approval for commercial marketing (that is, clinical use in the market), and which then allows professionals wide latitude in how to use it, the U.K. system foregoes these separate categories and limits physician discretion in the area of therapies using embryos or gametes. It is a ri gorous system of oversight that can track the fate of every embryo used for research or treatment. To implement this system, the U.K. creat ed the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, an independent regulator of treatments using eggs and sperm, and of treatment or research involving human embryos. It develops standards, and then issues licenses to specific clinics to proceed with specific interventions . To be licensed, clinics must meet safety and quality assurance standards, offer counseling to patients, monitor birth outcomes and the well- being of children conceived through the new te chnologies, and generally provide personnel and systems that allow for ongoing compliance monitoring. In addition to the clinic/research center (with named individuals involved), HFEA issues lic enses for the specific project or treatment. The latter can be on a broad basis for common, well-established procedures, or specifically for each individual case. For Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis, for example, licenses were originally for specific diseases. With experience this was relaxed and centers can now obtain licenses for a range of genetic diseases, but these still must be on the HFEA's approved list, and so \"off-label use\" is not allowed for app lications involving gametes and embryos. There is considerable similarity in the st ructures for product re gulation among different jurisdictions, with an emphasis on premarket balancing of risk and benefit. Some differences exist in the availability of conditional approval or other accelerated approval mechanisms for cell-therapy products, as well as in the management of embryos a nd gametes. In clinical care, off-label use is commonly permitted, again with the notable exception of the more comprehensive controls on therapies involving embryos and gametes in the United Kingdom. Overall, while capable of improvement, the st ructure of the U.S. regulatory system is adequate for overseeing human genome editing res earch and product approval. Specific areas in which additional effort might be made are identified in Chapters 3-7. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

It has b een known for 60 years that all life on earth is encoded in the sequence of DNA, which is inherited in each su cceeding generation, but accelerating advances have greatly enhanced u nderstanding of and the ability to manipulate DNA. This chapter reviews the vari ous types of and purposes fo r basic laboratory research involving human genome editing. It begins by describing the basi c tools of genome editing and the rapid advances in genome-editing technology. The chapter then details how genome editing can be used in basic laboratory research aime d at advancing understand ing of human cells and tissues; of human stem cells, diseases, a nd regenerative medicine; and of mammalian reproduction and development. Ethical and regulatory issues entailed in this research are then summarized. Throughout the chapter, key terms and concepts germane to basic research involving genome editing are defined; Box 3-1 de fines the most foundational of these terms. THE BASIC TOOLS OF GENOME EDITING All living organisms, from bacteria to plants to humans, use similar mechanisms to encode and express genes, although the si zes of their genomes and their numbers of genes differ greatly. Hence, understanding of any form of life is immensely informativ e with respect to understanding all other forms, and provides insights and applica tions that obtain across species\u2014a fact that has been particularly invaluable in the developmen t of methods for editi ng genes and genomes. The earliest studies in molecula r biology were on bacteria and their viruses. Their relative simplicity and ease of analysis we re key in establishing the basi s of the genetic code and the expression of genes. Parallel research on more complex organisms built on the advances in these studies of bacteria, and by the mid-1960s, it was cl ear that bacteria, plants, and animals shared many fundamental molecular mechanisms. Key discove ries in bacteria uncovered some of their mechanisms for protection agains t viruses, including so-called restriction endonucleases, proteins bacteria use to cleave the DNA of infecting viruses and \"restrict\" their growth. This discovery allowed scientists to cut DNA in pred ictable and reproducible ways and to reassemble the cut pieces into recombinant DNA. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 46 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION BOX 3-1 Foundational Terms The following terms are foundational to understanding any research involving DNA. DNA is a long polymer of similar repeating units of four types (A,T,C,G), where the letters denote distinct units called nucleotide bases . The bases pair specifically with each other (A with T and C with G) to form the well-known double helix of DNA with its two complementary strands. Segments of DNA sequence encode genes that can be copied ( transcribed ) from the DNA into a second type of nucleotide polymer called RNA . Some of these RNAs act by pairing with other RNAs to affect their functions, while others contribute to structures necessary for cellular activities, including the copying of some of the RNA molecules to encode proteins. Proteins are polymers of a different type of unit, called amino acids, of 20 different types; hence the copying of RNA to form proteins is known as translation since the copying is into a different \"language\"\u2014\"written\" in amino acids rather than nucleotides. These protein polymers fold into complex three-dimensional shapes that form the building blocks of the cells that make up the human body and perform the myriad functions of living organisms. The combination of transcription from DNA to RNA and translation of RNA to protein is known as gene expression , and is tightly regulated so that genes are expressed at the appropriate times and places and in the correct amounts. Thus, the functions of individual cells are dependent on the genes they express. The complete set of genes in an organism is called its genome. Most human cells contain two complete copies of the human genome, each comprising 3 billion base pairs and encoding approximately 20,000 genes encoding proteins, plus the regulatory elements that control their expression. One can think of the genome as the \"code\" or \"software\" and RNA and proteins and the structures they form as the \"hardware\" of cells and living organisms. By the mid-1970s, it was evident that recombinant DNA offered a powerful means of combining DNA in productive ways, with promising applications in biotechnology. However, this potential also raised questions about whether th e application of these novel methods might entail some risk. In light of those concerns, a group of scientists and others convened a meeting at Asilomar in 1975 to consider what precautions mi ght be needed to oversee this new technology and established a set of guidelines to regulate th e containment and conduct of the research. The descendants of those guidelines still regulate re combinant DNA research to this day, some of them incorporated into official regulatory system s. In practice, the most extreme concerns did not eventuate. Today, the use of recombinant DNA met hods is widespread worldwide and has yielded enormous benefits to humankind in terms of scientific understanding and medical advances, including many valuable drugs and treatments, and the biotechnology industry is now a thriving part of the world economy. Among methods developed through the use of re combinant DNA technology is the ability to introduce DNA into cells where it can be expressed\u2014a so-called transgene. This method is widely used in fundamental la boratory research (see Appendix A for more detail). When such exogenous DNA is introduced into a cell, it can inse rt into the DNA of the cell's genome largely at random and, depending on how and where it is in serted, can be expresse d as RNA and protein, although this overall process is not very effi cient. A key advance was the development of techniques for generating molecu lar tools that could be used to cut the DNA of genes and genomes in specific places to allow targeted al terations in the DNA sequence. It was found that double-strand breaks (DSBs) could be deliberately generate d by nucleases that cut DNA at defined sites ( homing nucleases, sometimes also called meganucleases, originally discovered in Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance BASIC RESEARCH 47 PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION yeast) (Choulika et al., 1995; Roux et al., 1994a ,b). In the succeeding 20 years, based on these groundbreaking discoveries, se veral additional types of nucleases that can be targeted to specific sites were developed and adapted for use in targeted DNA cleav age (Carroll, 2014). Such double-strand breaks also occur naturall y during DNA replication or through radiation or chemical damage, and cells have evolved mech anisms for repairing them by rejoining the ends (a process known as nonhomologous end joining or NHEJ ). However, this rejoining often is not perfect, and small insertions and deletions can be introduced during the re pair. Such insertions and deletions ( indels ) can disrupt the sequence of the DNA a nd often inactivate the gene that was cut. This targeted cleavage and inaccurate re pair through NHEJ provide a means of inactivating genes or gene-regulatory elem ents. Although the resulting indels are usually one or a few nucleotides long, in some cases they can consis t of thousands of base pairs. Genome editing through NHEJ can also be harnessed to create defined chromosomal deletions or chromosomal translocations by simultaneously creating two DSBs at different sites, followed by rejoining at those two sites. These sites can be either on th e same chromosome (producing a deletion) or on different chromosomes (pr oducing a translocation). More precise editing can be achieved if, during the breakage-repair process in the cell, an extra piece of DNA is provided that shares se quence (that is, is homologous) with the cleaved DNA. Such homologous repair also is used by normal cellular repair mechanisms. These mechanisms can be exploited to make precise changes. If homologous DNA slightly different in sequence from the cleaved sequence is introduced into the cell, that difference can be inserted into the sequence of the gene or genome, a process termed homology-directed repair (HDR). HDR can also be used to insert a nove l sequence (e.g., one or more genes) of variable leng th at a precise genomic location. In contrast to NHEJ, HDR-mediate d genome editing allows scientists to predict both where the edit will occur and the size and sequence of the resul ting change. Thus, HDR- mediated editing is very much like editing a document because prec ise changes in the characters can be made. Two types of targeted nucleases that have been widely developed for use in editing genes and genomes are zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator -like nucleases (TALENs). Both rely on proteins whose normal functi on is to bind to specific relatively short DNA sequences. Zinc fingers are segments of prot eins used by multicellular organisms to control the expression of their genes by binding to DNA (the y also typically bind zi nc as part of their structure; hence their name). They can be e ngineered by molecular bi ologists to recognize different short DNA sequences and can be joined to nucleases that cleave DNA. Thus, the zinc fingers target specific sequences in genes and genomes, and the attached nucleases cleave the DNA to generate a double-strand break by cleavi ng both strands of the DNA. ZFNs have been developed for gene editing and are in clinical trials\u2014for example, in attempts to confer resistance to the HIV virus in AIDS patients (Tebas et al., 2014). TALENs work similarly to ZFNs, also using DNA recognition prot eins (transcription activator-like effectors or TALEs) originally identified in bacteria that in fect plants. The DNA recognition se quences of TALE proteins are made of repeating units, each of which recogniz es a single base pair in the DNA. TALEs are simpler and easier to engineer than are zinc fi ngers and can similarly be joined to DNA-cleaving nucleases to yield TALENs. The preclinical application of TALEN s to engineer lymphocytes for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia wa s recently reported (Poirot et al., 2015). Thus, these tools are already we ll-established approaches to the use of genome editing for applications in gene therapy, and many of the asso ciated safety and regulatory issues have already been addressed (see Chapter 4).

The last 5 years have seen the developm ent of a completely novel system, known as CRISPR/Cas9 (CRISPR stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats,) (Doudna and Charpentier, 2014; Hsu et al., 2014). Short RNA sequences modelled on the CRISPR system, when paired with Cas9 (CRISPR associated prot ein 9, an RNA-targeted nuclease), or alternatively with other similar nucleases, can readily be programmed to edit specific segments of DNA. The CRISPR/Cas9 system is simpler, faster, and cheaper relative to earlier methods and can be highl y efficient. CRISPR/Cas9, like TA LEs, was originally discovered in bacteria, where it functions as part of an im munity system to protect bacteria from invading viruses (Barrangou and Dudley, 2016; Doudna and Charpentier, 2014). The key distinguishing feature of CRISPR/Cas9 is that it uses RNA sequ ences instead of protein segments to recognize specific sequences in the DNA by complementary base pairing. As first reengineered in 2012 (Jinek et al., 2012 ), the bacterial nuclease Cas9 binds a single RNA sequence known as a guide RNA tailored to recognize any se quence of choice. This two- component system can bind to the chosen site in DNA via the guide RNA and cleave the DNA using the Cas9 nuclease. Since it is simple to synthesize RNA of any desired sequence, generation of CRISPR/Cas9 targeting nucleases is straight forward\u2014the system is readily programmed to target any sequence in any genome. Programs exist for choosing suitable guide RNAs, and while not all guides work equally well, testing a number of guides to find effective ones is not difficult or expensive. This ease of design, together with the remarkable specific ity and efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 has revolutionized the field of ge nome editing and has major implications for advances in fundamental researc h, as well as in such applicat ions as biotechnology, agriculture, insect control, and gene therapy. Figure 3-1 provides a summary of the ZFN, TALEN, and CR ISPR methods of genome editing. As mentioned, these genome-editing met hods are being widely applied across a broad range of biological sciences, from fundamental laboratory re search on cells and laboratory animals; to applications in agri culture involving improvements in cr op plants and farm animals, to applications in human health, both at the research leve l and, increasingly, in c linical applications. Agricultural applications have been addressed in other studies by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medici ne (see Chapter 1) and potential clinical applic ations are the subject of subsequent chapters of this report. The focus in this chapter is on basic laboratory research using genome editing. This research addresses fundamental questi ons concerning the use and optimization of genome-editing methods both in cultured cells and in experimental multicellular organisms (e.g., mice, flies, plants). Such basic discovery re search is essential for improving any future applications of genome editing. A pplications of genome editing in laboratory research also have added powerful new tools that are contributing greatly to understandi ng of basic cellular functions, metabolic processes, i mmunity and resistance to patholog ical infections, and diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. Th ese laboratory studies ar e overseen by standard laboratory safety mechanisms. In addition to these applications this chapter reviews the potential for using similar approaches in basic research on human germline cells, not for the purposes of procreation but solely for laboratory research. Th is work will provide valuable insights into the processes of early human development and repr oductive success, and coul d lead to clinical benefits, directly as a result of work with human embryos and germline cells or through improvements in the derivation and main tenance of stem cells in vitro.

In all three cases, the DNA cut can be repaired by nonhomologous end joining of the ends or by repair directed by a stretch of homologous DNA (green), producing alterations in the genome of the target organism, which can be from any species.

Different species of bacteria use somewhat different CRISPR syst ems, and although the CRISPR/Cas9 system is currently the most widely used because of its simplicity, alternative systems being developed and will provide increased flexibility in methodology (Wright et al., 2016; Zetsche et al., 2015). Among the issues that need to be addressed goin g forward are the specificity and efficiency of the DNA cleavage mediated by CRISPR-guided nucl eases. While the roughly 20-base sequence recognized by the guide RNA provides a great deal of specificity (an exact match should occur by chance in approximately 1 \u00d7 10e12 base pairs\u20141 in a trillion\u2014the equivalent of several hundred mammalian genomes), so there is some small potential for so-called off-target events , in which the nucleases make cuts in unintended places , especially if the guide RNA binds to DNA sequences that are slightly different from the in tended target. Some early experiments suggested that off-target events might occu r at a significant rate, but as th e methods have been improved and as their application has increasingly been in nor mal cells rather than cultured cell lines, the frequency of off-target cleavages appears to be very low. Advances have been achieved in the specificity of Cas9 cleavage (Kle instiver et al., 2016; Slaymaker et al., 2016) and methods have been developed for monitoring the frequency of off-target cleavage. (See Appendix A for more detail.) Another significant advance has occurred in th e development of methods for modifying the CRISPR/Cas9 system so that DNA cleavage is a voided. For example, the nuclease function of Cas9 can be inactivated so that a complex of guide RNA and such a \"dead\" Cas9 (dCas9) will target a specific site via the guide RNA but w ill not cleave the DNA (Qi et al., 2013). By coupling other proteins with different activities to the dC as9, however, different sorts of modifications can be made to the DNA or its associated proteins . Thus, it is possible to design variants of CRISPR/Cas9, ZFN, or TALE that will turn on or turn off adjacent genes, make single-base changes, or modify the chromatin proteins th at associate with DNA in chromosomes and thus modify the epigenetic regulation of genes (Ding et al., 2016; Gaj et al., 2 016; ; Konerman et al., 2015; Sander and Joung, 2014). All of these noncl eaving variants fail to cleave DNA, thus reducing the potential for delete rious off-target events, and ma ny other modifications are being introduced to enhance specificity and reduce off-ta rget events (see Appendix A for further detail). Most recently, CRISPR/C2c2, a programmable R NA-guided, RNA-cleaving nuclease, has been described (Abudayyeh et al., 2016; Ea st-Seletsky et al., 2016) that could be used to knock down specific RNA copies of genes without affecting the gene itself. This development raises the future possibility of nonheritable or reversible editing. As can be seen from this brief survey, the ra pidly developing versatil ity of these RNA-guided genome-editing systems is opening up numerous means of manipulating the expression and function of genes. A recent report of methods for inducibly knocking down or knocking out genes in a multiplex fashion in many cell types, including human pluripotent stem cells, as well as in mice (Bertero et al., 2016) further expands th e potential of these methods. These and other advances have rapidly rendered these methods basic tools of molecular biology worldwide, adding to the existing to olkit assembled over the past 40 ye ars. These methods are now being applied to study with unprecedented ease the functions of genes in cells and in experimental animals, such as yeast, fish, mice, and many othe rs, to enhance understanding of life. They also Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

BASIC LABORATORY RESEARCH TO AD VANCE UNDERSTANDING OF HUMAN CELLS AND TISSUES Basic biomedical research ai med at discovering more about the mechanisms and capabilities of genome editing offers significant opportunitie s to advance human medicine. Genome-editing research conducted on human cells, tissues, em bryos, and gametes in the laboratory offers important avenues for learning more about hum an gene functions, genomic rearrangements, DNA-repair mechanisms, early human development, the links between genes and disease, and the progression of cancer and other dise ases that have a strong genetic basis. Manipulation of genes and gene expression by genome editing allows one to understand the functions of genes in the behavior of human cells, includ ing why they malfunction in disease. For example, editing of cultured human cells to model the changes that aris e in cancer or in genetic ally inherited diseases provides culture models of those diseases with which to understand the molecular basis of the resulting defects. Such laborat ory studies also allow the development of means of combating those defects, such as the testing of potential dr ugs in cell culture. All of those approaches are much easier now than they were just a few years ago. Certain cells derived from an early embryo, after fertilization but prior to the developmental stage at which it would implant in a woman's uterus, are referred to as embryonic stem (ES) cells. These ES cells have scientific advantages because they can reproduce in cell culture and have the potential to form all the different body cell types while lacking the potential themselves to develop into a fetus. It is now also possible to create stem cells by manipulating adult somatic cells to convert them to a state in which they, t oo, have the ability to form multiple cell types, reducing the need to take stem cells from an early embryo. These are referred to as induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Such pluripotent stem cells can be cultured in vitro and induced to develop into many different cell ty pes, such as neurons, muscle or skin cells, and many others. Advances over the last several decades in understanding stem cells and how they can be used form the foundation for the field of regenerative medicine, which seeks to repair or replace damaged cells within human tissues or to genera te new tissues after disease or injury. Although these are increasingly areas of clinical practice, a nd the application of gene tically altered cells in humans is not covered in this chapter (see Chapter 4), there are ne vertheless a number of important reasons why scientists aim to undertake basic investigations in human and animal stem cells in the laboratory. Genome-editing methods have been extremely useful in generating a variety of genetic modifications in human ES and iPS cells. Before the advent of effici ent genome-editing tools, these cells had proven resistant to genetic modi fication with the standard tools of homologous recombination that had been used effectively in mouse ES cells. Using thos e tools in human cells resulted in very low frequencies of targeted r ecombination. Improvements in efficiency resulting from the use of CRISPR/Cas9 have enabled rapi d generation of tagged re porter cell lines, making it possible to follow differentiation pathways, look for interacting pr oteins, sort appropriate cell types, and investigate the functi ons of individual genes and pa thways in cells, among many other applications (Hockemeyer and Jaenisch, 2016). Fo r example, the ability to make precisely Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Conversely, genome editing also allows the targeted correction of disease mutations in patient-specific iPS cell lines to generate genetically matched control lines. Such modified stem cell lines are us ed primarily to conduct experimental and preclinical studi es, to investigate specific diseas e processes, and to test drugs that could be used to treat such diseases. In th e future, such edited stem cell lines could be used for various forms of somatic cell -based therapies (see Chapter 4). BASIC LABORATORY RESARCH TO ADVANCE UNDERSTANDING OF MAMMALIAN REPRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT Germline cells are cells with th e capacity to be involved in forming a new individual and to have their genetic material passed on to a new ge neration. They include precu rsor cells that form eggs and sperm, as well as the eggs and sperm cells themselves. When fertilization occurs to create an embryo, the earliest stages of this embryo, referred to as the zygote (fertilized egg) and blastocyst, have the potential to divide and form a ll the cells that will make up the future individual, including somatic (body) cells and new germ cells. As the embryo continues to develop, its cells differentiate into specific cell types that become increasingly restricted in their functions (for example, to form sp ecialized cells such as those in the nervous system, skin, or gut). During reproduction and development, ge netic changes made directly in gametes (egg and sperm), in egg or sperm precursor cells, or in very early embryos woul d be propagated throughout the future cells of an organism and would ther efore be heritable by subsequent generations. As emphasized above, this chapter focuses exclusivel y on the use of genome-e diting technologies in the laboratory, and not on clini cal applications in humans or in embryos for the purposes of implantation to initiate pregnancy. Nevertheless, it is important to understand which cell types are involved in human development and their f unctions, because this information informs researchers' decisions about how to study particular scientific questions and informs ethical, regulatory, and social discussions around when and why it may be useful to use human cells, including embryos, in ba sic laboratory research. Genome Editing of Germline Stem Cells and Progenitor Cells It is already possible in mice to genetically modify the genome in a fertilized egg (the zygote), in individual cells of the early embryo, in pluripotent ES cells, or in spermatogonial stem cells, just as in somatic cells. In all these cases, the effects of the genetic modi fications can be studied directly in the embryo or in cells in culture. There are a num ber of ways to undertake these genetic manipulations and a number of cell types in which they can be conducted. The cell types below are all considered part of the germline or ha ve the capacity to cont ribute to the germline: embryonic stem cells derived from normal early embryos (bla stocyst stages), cells from early embryos produced after somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT),35 and 35SCNT is a technique in which the orig inal nucleus of an egg cell is remove d and replaced with a \"donor\" nucleus taken from another cell (for example, from a somatic cell that has undergone genome editing). This is the technique that was used to create Dolly, the first cl oned mammal obtained from an adult cell. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance BASIC RESEARCH 53 PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION iPS cells obtained by reprogramming somatic cells into an ES cell-like state. In mice, these cell types can all be manipulat ed experimentally through genome editing. Stem cells of the types listed above can contribute to the germline in vi vo after they are introduced into mouse embryos at the morula or blastocyst stage. This process generally creates an embryo that is a chimera, in which some cells are derived from the stem cells introdu ced into the embryo, and some are formed from the initia l embryonic cells. Mouse or rat sp ermatogonial stem cells can be cultured and their genomes edited, and the cells can then be introduced into recipient mouse or rat testes, where they can give rise to sperm able to fertilize oocytes, at leas t in vitro (see Appendix A and Chapman et al., 2015). In all of these cases, when the resultant embryos are transferred back into the uterus to complete preg nancy, it is possible to establish lin es of mice carry ing the genetic alterations. These approaches provide unprecedented opportunities to explore the functions of all the genes in the genome and to develop rodent models of human diseases. Proof-of-principle experiments also have been reported in whic h disease-related genetic mutations have been corrected in mouse zygotes (Long et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2013), embryonic stem cells, or spermatogonial stem cells (Wu et al., 2015) a nd then transmitted though the germline to produce genetically corrected mice. The application of genome-editing technologies to the equivalent human cell types holds considerable potential value for fundamental research without any intent to use such manipulated cells for human reproductive purposes. Improve d knowledge of how an early human embryo develops also is valuable in its own right, and because such knowledge can help answer questions about humans' own early development, as we ll as facilitate unde rstanding and potential prevention or treatment of a wide range of clini cal problems. A number of these applications are described below. Improvements in Assisted Reproductive Technology The success of human repr oductive technologies and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of inherited diseases has been, and continues to be, dependent on in vitro fertilization (IVF) and on culturing of human embryos from the z ygote to the blastocyst stage. However, tools for ensuring that an individual embryo in cultur e is normal and capable of completing pregnancy remain limited. Most embryo research has been conducted on mouse embryos, which are similar to human embryos in certain respects but significan tly different in others (see Box 3-2). Even the conditions in which human embryos are kept in cu lture are based largely on those established for mouse embryos. High rates of aneuploidy 36 are found in cultured human embryos relative to other species. This aneuploidy is often mosaic\u2014that is , it varies among cells in the embryo (Taylor et al., 2014)\u2014but how it arises and how it relates to in vitro cu lture conditions are not well understood. There is also concern that epigenetic37 abnormalities might occur in human embryos in vitro (Lazaraviciute et al., 2014), which might co mpromise development or health, even later in life. Research on early-stage human embryos in culture should enable scientists to better understand the cellular and molecu lar pathways that control early human embryo development and the conditions under which human embryos in culture can develop successfully. This knowledge could in turn he lp improve IVF outcomes. 36Having a chromosome number that is not an exact multiple of the usual haploid number. 37The term \"epigenome\" refers to a set of chemical modifications to the DNA of the genome and to proteins and RNAs that bind to DNA in the chromosomes to affect whether and how genes are expressed.

All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 54 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION BOX 3-2 Differences Between Mouse and Human Development In the past few years, considerable progress has been made in understanding the events that allow the zygote to develop into the blastocys t, the earliest stage of embryonic development in which different cell types are formed. Much of this research has been conducted on mouse embryos. However, it is clear that a number of important differences exist between the development of mouse and rodent embryos and t hose of humans and most other mammals (see the figure below). Significant research remains necessary to understand what these differences are, how they arise, and why t hey are significant. Genome editing in human cells and early embryos in the laboratory provides an im portant tool to help address these questions. A mouse blastocyst takes 3-4 days to develop, whereas a human blastocyst takes 5-6 days. The blastocyst has about 100 cells, is about 1/10th of a millimeter in diameter, and contains only three cell types; there is an outer layer called trophectoderm that encloses an inner cell mass consisting of primitive endoderm and epiblast cells. Mice, humans and all mammalian embryos spend their first few days of development making mostly the cell types needed to survive in the uterus, the placenta and the yolk sac, whic h are derived from trophectoderm and primitive endoderm respectively (Cockburn and Rossant, 2010). The epiblast cells are the pluripotent cells that give rise to the entire embryo including its germ cells (Gardner and Rossant, 1979). Comparison of blastocyst and early postimplantation development between mouse and human. Whereas the blastocysts of the two spec ies (left-hand figures) look very sim ilar, later stages at the time of implantation (right-hand figures) show significant differences, particularly in the extraembryonic tissues. (A) The trophectoderm of a mouse blastocyst a fter implantation undergoes a proliferative phase stimulated by FGF4 signals from the epiblast (EPI, blue) to form the extraembryonic ectoderm (green) Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

There is only lim ited invasion of the maternal uterus by mouse trophoblast cells until much later in placental development. PE = primitive endoderm; TE = trophectoderm. (B) The trophectoderm of the human blastocyst does not stay in close contact with the epiblast after implantation but invades into the endometrium, w here it will later form the chorionic villi. SOURCE: Rossant, 2015. In addition to the differences summarized in the figure above, there are clearly other differences in the control of development of the early embryos of the two species. In a mouse embryo, the signaling pathways and downstream gene regulatory pathways that drive the formation of the three cell types of the blastocyst are fairly well understood (Frum and Ralston, 2015). Each cell is restricted to one of these three fates by the blastocyst stage. Information from the molecular analysis of events in the early mouse embryo has helped in understanding the underlying principles of the establishment of cellular pluripotency. Together with knowledge gained from studying embryonic stem (ES) cells, this information aided in the momentous development of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) ce lls in which adult cells are reprogrammed to pluripotency using factors known to be expressed in the early embryo (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006; Takahashi et al., 2007). The ability to create iPS cells represents an example in which basic laboratory research contributed to critical advances in a field\u2014in this case regenerative medicine. Scientists can use these cells to generate cells to study or treat disease, greatly reducing the need to use cells derived from embryos. Because iPS cells can be created from a person's own cells, they also minimize the immune rejection that can occur if cells arising from one individual are used in another. In contrast to understanding of mouse development, much less is known about the cellular and molecular events of blastocyst formati on in human embryos. Some experiments on the timing of cell-lineage restriction have been performed, but not with as much precision as in mice because of the restricted number of embryos that are available for research. Compounding the challenges of studying development in human em bryos has been the absence of appropriate methods. The development of genome-editing tools can help address this gap. The early postimplantation stages of mous e and human development differ morphologically and perhaps in other ways not currently understood. Current data suggest that cell-lineage restriction occurs later in a human embryo than in a mouse embryo, probably not until after the blastocyst is fully developed. New technologies for analyzing gene expression in small amounts of tissue, and even from single cells, are helping scientists to gain insights into the molecular pathways controlling lineage development. Single-cell RNA-sequencing, a method to look at genome-wide gene expression in single cell s, has been applied to early human embryos (Blakeley et al., 2015; Petropoulos et al., 2016). From these data it is already apparent that there are both similarities and significant differences between humans and mice in the developmental profiles of gene expression, including in some of the key genetic drivers known for mouse preimplantation development. It is possible to speculate about which of these genes are required to drive human preimplantation devel opment, but it is not yet known how critical they are. Genome-editing methods such as CRISPR/Cas9 will allow determination of the roles of those genes expressed specifically during human pre-implantation development. Differences between mouse and human blastocyst formation also are thought to underlie the significant differences in the properties of ES cells derived from these two species (Rossant, 2015). Although both mouse and human ES cells are derived from the pluripotent cells of the blastocyst and share expression of some key pluripotency genes, they have many different properties, including their dependence on different growth factors for their self-renewal. Many of the properties of human ES cells are more similar to those of epiblast cells found in early postimplantation stages of mouse development , leading to the question of whether human embryos actually go through the same so-called \"na\u00efve\" state of pluripotency observed in Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 56 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION mouse blastocysts and ES cells (Huang et al., 2014; Pera, 2014). In addition to ES cells obtained from the pluripotent cell lineage in the blastocyst, it is possible in mice to derive stem cells corresponding to progenitors of both trophectoderm and extraembryonic endoderm, termed TS and XEN cells , respectively (Rossant, 2015). These stem cell types are valuable for understanding molecular mechanisms of differentiation, as well as the properties of these cell lineages, which are relevant to placental and yolk sac biology in health and disease. However, attempts to derive equi valent extraembryonic stem cell types from human blastocysts have not yet been successful (H ayakawa et al., 2014). Such cell lines would be of great value, especially given the considerable evolutionary divergence seen in placental types among mammals. This divergence includes s ubstantial differences in the types of cells comprising the human placenta compared to mice and other mammals. For example, syncytiotrophoblast cells that invade and directly interact with the endometrium (the cells lining the uterus/womb), are present in the placenta of great apes and may even have unique properties in humans. As a result, it is not possible to rely on knowledge gained from studying mouse cells to understand normal development of the human placenta. Similarly, it is not possible to understand pathologies in which the placenta or placental interaction with the mother fails, which can cause miscarriage, or when the placenta invades too vigorously into the uterus, which can lead to choriocarcinoma. All of the differences between humans and mice di scussed above mean that it is not possible to accurately infer developmental events in human embryos from studying mice. This limitation has practical consequences for th e development of improved IVF technologies, as well as for the ability to derive the best plur ipotent or other stem cells for modeling of human disease and for future regenerative therapies. Thus , there is considerable interest in experimental investigation of preimplantation human development in culture, in jurisdictions where such research on human embryos is permitted. The goals of this work are to understand the fundamental events of fertilization, activation of the embryonic genome, cell lineage de velopment, epigenetic events such as X-inactivation, and othe rs, and how these events compar e and contrast with what is understood from studying mice. Similar research also could provide insights into the reasons for the high rates of early pregnancy loss in natural human pregnancies (1 0 to 45 percent, depending on the age of the mother), as well as the causes of infertility. Better understandi ng of sperm development would be crucial in addressing issues of ma le infertility. Pluripotent stem cells arise from the early embryo, and these cells can generate ES cells in culture. Better understanding of human embryonic development would provide insights into the orig ins and regulation of pl uripotency and how to translate that knowledge into improved stem cells for regenerative medicine. The potential benefits of such research are not limited to embryonic stem cells. Cell types that give rise to the yolk sac and the placenta also are determined in the early embryo prior to implantation. The yolk sac and placenta establish the crucial links with the mother during pregnancy and provide nutrients and other factors that enable the em bryo to survive. Defects in these tissues can compromise a pregnancy, leading to miscarriag e, premature birth, or postnatal abnormalities. Better understanding of how the yolk sac and placenta originate would help in improving techniques for overcoming infertility and preven ting early miscarriage, as well as understanding and preventing congenital malforma tions. These extraembryonic cell types also provide cues that pattern the early postimplanta tion embryo, although almost not hing is known about these processes in humans. These possibi lities and others discussed in this chapter are summarized in Table 3-1. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

CRI SPR/Cas9-guided activati on or inactivation of specific target pathways could be used to understand overall gene regulation in development. Indeed, as the efficiency of CRI SPR/Cas9 continues to increase , it should be possible to use genome editing to knock out38 genes in zygotes and study the e ffects directly in genetically altered embryos. None of these experiments woul d involve human pregnancies, so none could result in heritable germline modifications. They w ould all be in vitro experiments, with results being analyzed primarily at the blastocyst st age in the first 1-6 days of development. In some cases, there could be interest in explor ing the effects of altering specific genes at the next stages of human development, notably the early stages after the embryo would implant in a uterus. At present, culture of human embryos up to the stage just prior to germ-layer formation (at 14 days after fertilization or the formation of the \"primitive streak\") is permitted in many countries. Improved culture systems that allow hu man embryos to develop in culture during the implantation period are being developed. Recent results suggest that these systems could be used to study the elaboration of extr aembryonic structures and of the epiblast into an \"embryonic disc\"\u2014processes that occur in humans in wa ys not found in mice (Deglincerti et al., 2016; Shahbazi et al., 2016).

Already at least two research groups (in the United Kingdom and Sweden) have receiv ed regulatory permission to carry out CRISPR/Cas9 experiments on human embryos, aimed at addressing these kinds of fundamental biological questions. Knowledge gained from such studies is expect ed to inform and improve IVF procedures and embryo implantation rates and reduce rates of miscarriage. Conversely, the same studies may lead to novel methods of contraception. Such re search also should lead to better ways of establishing and maintaining stem cells from thes e early embryonic stages, which could facilitate efforts to derive cell types for studies and treatm ents of disease and trau matic injury. Knowledge gained from these laboratory studies using ge nome-editing methods in early human embryos should also provide information a bout the suitability of these me thods for any eventual potential clinical use. That is, basic rese arch can be expected to inform an understanding of the feasibility of making heritable, and prefer ably nonmosaic, changes in the genome (see Chapter 5). Because human embryos that can be used in research are a valuable and relatively scarce resource, it will be important to ensure that the most efficient methods are used for these laboratory studies of their basic biology. Thus, it is likely that in the co urse of this research, various technical issues associated with improving the use of genome-editing methods in human embryos will be addressed. Relevant questions include the type and form of genome-edit ing components to be introduced; whether to use Cas9 or an alternative nuclease; what method to use to introduce the ge nome-editing components\u2014e.g., as DNA, mRNA, protein, or ribonucleoprotein complex; whether to use single guide RNAs, pairs, or multiple guide RNAs as part of the editing machinery; the size of the DNA template and whet her such a template is required; the optimal timing for genome editing, i.e., whether information can be obtained by using two-cell embryos, whether it necessary to use one-cell embryos, or whether it is best to introduce the reagents along with the sp erm during in vitro fertilization; whether mosaicism can be tolerated, keepi ng in mind that it may be an advantage for certain experiments, as when cell fate is to be followed, but may need to be avoided in other cases, such as when investigating a ge ne whose product is a secreted protein; and how to test and improve modified versions of nucleases such as Ca s9 or inhibitors of certain repair mechanisms (e.g., an effectiv e inhibitor of nonhomologous end joining may be needed if the experiment demands homol ogy-directed repair [Howden et al., 2016]). Understanding of Gametogenesis and Infertility In mice, the generation of spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) lines from the adult testes has provided a rich source of cells with which to stud y the process of spermat ogenesis in vitro and in vivo, after regrafting to the testes . It is possible to alter these cells genetically and study the impact of the changes on the process of sperma togenesis itself or, in mice, the impact on the offspring. It is also possible to correct genetic mutations in the stem cells in vitro using CRISPR/Cas9. Proof of principle for such an approach has been published (Wu et al., 2015). This work used CRISPR/Cas9 editing in mouse SSCs to correct a gene mutation that causes cataracts in mice. The edited SSCs were transfe rred back to mouse test es, and round spermatids Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Resulting offspring were corr ectly edited at 100 percen t efficiency. Similar experiments have been conducted using SSCs from other species, including macaques (Hermann et al., 2012). Stable human SSC lines have not yet been reported, but would clearly be an important tool for understanding male infertility and for exploring su ch issues as the higher rate of mutations associated with age. This is an active area of research because it may enable restoration of fertility in male cancer patients after radiation or chem otherapy. The ability to grow and manipulate human SSCs would, however, raise the possi bility of generating human germline alterations if the cells were grafte d back to the testes or used in IVF. Related issues arise from experiments in wh ich both oocytes and sperm progenitors have been generated from mouse ES cells. ES-derived oocytes can be fertilized by normal sperm, and ES-derived spermatids can fertilize eggs by ICSI (Hayashi et al., 2016; Miyauchi, 2016; Zhou et al., 2016). Human gametes ha ve not yet been generated successfully from pluripotent stem cells, althoug h two recent papers report the generation of early germ cell progenitors from human ES cells (Irie et al., 2015; Sa saki et al., 2015). Through the use of genome-editing methods, this work also highlighted signifi cant differences between mice and humans in the genes involved in spec ification of primordial germ cells. There is evidence as well that knowledge gained from st udying later stages of spermatogenesis in mice may not always be applicable to the same proce ss in humans. These findings reflect the role of research on human cells in answering questions about human biology. If human haploid gametes could be generated from human pl uripotent cells, as they can be in mice, it would open up new avenues for understanding gametogenesis and the causes of infertility. It would also open up possibilities for using heritable ge nome modifications to address health problems that originate from genetic causes. ETHICAL AND REGULATO RY ISSUES IN BASIC RESEARCH As described in more detail in Chapter 2, basi c science research performed in the laboratory on somatic cells will be subject to regulation fo cused on safety for laboratory workers and the environment, including special review by instit utional biosafety committees for work involving recombinant DNA. Few new ethical i ssues are raised, although if th e cells and tissues come from identifiable living individuals, donor consent and privacy will be a concern, and in most cases the protocols will be subject to at least some review by institutional review boards. Research with embryos is more controversial. As noted earlier, re search using viable embryos is illegal in a small number of U.S. states (NCSL, 2016), and while permitted in most states, research that expose s embryos to risk generally may not be funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS) funds; this is due to the Dickey-Wicker Amendment (Public Law No: 114-113 Division H Title V Section 508), which has been adopted repeatedly since the 1990s as part of the HHS appropriations process, including in the bills introduced for 2017 funding (see Chapter 2).39 It states: (a) None of the funds made availabl e in this Act may be used for\u2014 (1) the creation of a human embryo or embryos for research purposes; or 39 Sec. 508(a) in both S.3040 and H.R.5926.

(b) For purposes of this section, the te rm \"human embryo or embryos\" includes any organism, not protected as a human s ubject under 45 CFR 46 as of the date of the enactment of this Act, that is derived by fertilization, parthenogenesis, cloning, or any other means from one or more human gametes or human diploid cells. The effect of this combination of state and fede ral law is to make embryo research legal in most of the United States but gene rally not eligible for HHS funding. Additional, extralegal oversigh t of laboratory research using human embryos comes from the stem cell research oversight committees that we re widely adopted pursuant to recommendations of the National Academies regarding embryonic stem cell research (IO M, 2005; NRC and IOM, 2010). Recently, the Internationa l Society for Stem Cell Resear ch, whose membership includes investigators from around the world as well as th e United States, adopted guidelines calling for the transformation of these voluntary stem cell research oversight committees into human embryo research oversight (EMRO) review committ ees that would oversee \"al l research that (a) involves preimplantation stages of human de velopment, human embryos, or embryo-derived cells or (b) entails the producti on of human gametes in vitro wh en such gametes are tested by fertilization or used for th e creation of embryos\" (ISSCR, 2016). The review would include details of the proposal and the credentials of the researcher s under the auspices of these independent, multidisciplinary committees of scie ntists, ethicists, and members of the public. The proposed committees would assess research go als \"within an ethical framework to ensure that research proceeds in a transparent and responsible manner. The project proposal should include a discussion of alternative methods and provide a rationale for employing the requested human materials, including justification for the nu mbers of preimplantation embryos to be used, the proposed methodology, and for performing the e xperiments in a human rather than animal model system.\" CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION Laboratory research involving human genome ed iting\u2014that is, research that does not involve contact with patients\u2014follows regulatory pathways that are the same as those for other basic laboratory in vitro research with human tissues, and raises issues alr eady managed under existing ethical norms and regulatory regimes. This includes not only work with somatic ce lls, but also the donation and use of human gametes and embryos for research purposes, wher e this research is permitted. While there are those who disagree with the policies embodied in some of those rules, the rules continue to be in effect. Important scientific and clinical issu es relevant to human fertility and reproduction require continued laboratory research on human gametes and their progenitors, human embryos and pluripotent stem cells. This research is neces sary for medical and scientific purposes that are not directed at heritable genome editing, though it will also provide valuable information and techniques that could be applied if heritable genome editing were to be attempted in the future.

Somatic cells contribute to the various tissues of the body but not to the germline, mean ing that, in contrast with heritable germline editing (discussed in Chapter 5), the effects of ch anges made to somatic cells are limited to the treated individual and would not be inherited by future generations. The idea of making genetic changes to somatic cells, referred to as gene therapy, is not new,40 and considerable progress has been made over the past several decades toward clinical applications of gene therapy to treat disease (Cox et al., 2015; Naldin i, 2015). Hundreds of early-stage and a small number of late- stage trials are underway (Mulli n, 2016), although only two gene therapies have been approved as of late 2016 (Reeves, 2016). Existing technical approaches to gene th erapy are based on the results of extensive laborato ry research on individual ce lls and on nonhuman organisms, establishing the means to add, delete, or modify ge nes in living cells or organisms. Prospects for future applications of gene therapy have rece ntly been greatly enhanced by improvements in genome-editing methods, particularly the deve lopment of nuclease-based editing tools (see Chapter 3). This chapter begins by providing background information on human somatic cell genome editing, including definitions of key terms. It th en summarizes the advantages of genome editing over traditional gene therapy a nd earlier approaches, and briefl y reviews the repair methods\u2014 homologous and nonhomologous\u2014used for nuclease-ba sed genome editing. Next is a discussion of potential human applications of somatic cell genome editing. Scientific and technical considerations and ethical and regul atory issues are then examined in turn. The chapter ends with conclusions and recommendations. Additional scie ntific and technical detail on methods for genome editing are provided in Appendix A. BACKGROUND Genes, Genomes, and Genetic Variants All humans contain two sets of genes inherited fro m their parents; each of these sets of genes is called a genome and is packaged into 23 chromosomes. The haploid (single) human genome 40Gene therapy denotes the replacement of faulty genes or th e addition of new genes to cure or improve the ability to fight disease. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 64 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION is around 3 billion (3 \u00d7 109) base pairs long, and the two inherited genomes in each somatic cell (diploid ) encode the information requi red for the assembly and functioning of a person's cells and body throughout life. Although people speak of the human genome, each genome differs from any other at many positions (around 1 in 1,000 base pairs, or about 3 million positions), and these genetic differences contribute to what makes individual humans unique (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2015). Many of these va riations probably have little or no effect, but some affect the expressi on and/or functions of genes. Within the human genome lie approximately 20,000 genes that encode proteins, th e molecules that actua lly build human cells and bodies, plus many other DNA elements that c ontrol when, where, and how much each gene is expressed (Ezkurdia et al., 2014). Some varian ts in genes can change the properties of the proteins they encode, while other genomic varian ts can affect the expression of genes. Such variants influence the co lor of hair or eyes, blood type, heig ht, weight, and many other individual features, although most human tr aits are affected by interactions among multiple genes. Furthermore, other influences, such as diet, ex ercise, education, and environment, have major impacts by interacting with a person's genetic makeup. Many of the variations in genomic sequences aris e from alterations in the sequences of base pairs that arise during replication (copying) of the DNA during cell division (one can think of them as typographical changes). These alterati ons occur continually at a certain rate, and although cells have mechanisms for proofreading and correcting (editing) such changes, some escape the proofreading process and persist. Furt hermore, the frequency of DNA alterations can be increased by radiation (e.g., by ultraviolet rays in sunlight or by cosmic or X-rays) or by environmental chemicals (e.g., cigarette smoke a nd other carcinogens). As mentioned, many of these variants have little or no e ffect, but others have positive or deleterious effects. This process of variation in human genomes has been going on since before humans evolved as a separate species and continues to this da y. Evolution relies on this conti nual generation of variants\u2014those that are advantageous are selected for, whereas those that are deleterious are selected against. Whether a particular variant is a dvantageous or deleterious, howe ver, can vary with the context and may be a consideration in deciding whethe r to edit variants for clinical benefit. Genetically Inherited Diseases One primary impetus for interest in possible clin ical applications of th e recent advances in genome editing is the possibility that they provide new avenues for treating and preventing human disease. One such possible use is in th e treatment of genetically inherited diseases, thousands of which are known. 41 Certain deleterious variants can be inherited from one or both parents, while others can arise de novo in the embryo rather than being inherited from either parent. The pattern of inhe ritance varies with the nature of th e variant. If a variation that causes loss of function in a gene is inherited from one parent, it often has no evid ent effect, because the unaltered variant inherited from the other parent is sufficient to provide the function needed. Geneticists refer to this mode of inheritance as recessive. Recessive gene vari ants usually (but not always) have little or no effect in the so-called heterozygous state, when two different variants are present in the ferti lized egg (zygote) and in the subse quent child and adult. That is, a person generally will not have the disease caused by a recessive deleterious gene variant unless 41OMIM, https://www.omim.org (accessed January 10, 2017); Genetic Alliance, http://w ww.diseaseinfosearch.org (accessed January 25, 2017).

All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance SOMATIC GENOME EDITING 65 PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION that variant is inherited from both parents. If both parents are heterozygous, each having one copy of a deleterious variant, each of their chil dren will have a 25 percent chance of inheriting two copies of that variant\u2014the so-called homozygous state. In that case, there is no functional variant is available, and the consequence may be a genetically inherited disease. Many examples of this phenomenon exist (e.g., certain forms of severe-combined immunodeficiencies, such as bubble boy disease, as well as sickle-c ell anemia and Tay-Sachs disease). Other variants may actually produce medical pr oblems even when present in a single copy despite the presence of a functional gene variant. Such variants, called dominant, produce deleterious effects even in the heterozygous state. A clear example is Huntington's disease, in which a single copy of a dominant disease-causi ng variant produces la te-onset disease. Some inherited diseases, such as certain fo rms of hemophilia, which affect blood clotting, involve genes that are present on the X chromosome (so-called X-linked ). Because men have only one X chromosome, whereas women have two, a single abnormal X-linked hemophilia gene in a man will lead to the disease being manifest, whereas women with just one deleterious variant will be carriers of the altered gene, usually without havi ng bleeding symptoms (so called silent carriers ). Adding to the complexity of understanding gene tic disorders is the observation, noted above, that some variants may be either deleterious or advantageous depending on the context. Probably the best known example is sickle-cell disease, wh ich is caused by a variation in one of the genes encoding hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxyge n in red blood cells. If the sickle hemoglobin variant is inherited from bot h parents (homozygous), it cause s the hemoglobin protein to aggregate under certain conditions, leading to deformation of the red blood cells into a sickled shape that interferes with blood circulation, causing multiple difficulties and much pain and impairment of normal tissue functions. Heterozy gous individuals (heterozygotes) who inherit just one sickle gene variant have few if any si gns of disease and are know n as carriers since they carry the sickle-cell variant and can pass it on to their children. It turns out that heterozygosity for this variant makes carriers somewhat resistant to malaria parasites that infect their red blood cells. That is, the sickle-cell va riant provides a significant surv ival advantage in areas where malaria is present, and for that reason has been selected for and is relatively prevalent in such areas such as Africa, India, and the Mediterr anean, where carriers are more common than in other areas. There are other examples of such balanced selection ba sed on heterozygous advantage, balanced against the disadvantage of inheriting two disease-associated variants. Finally, it is important to note th at most human diseases are thought to be affected by genetic variants in multiple genes, with each variant having only a minor effect on disease progression. Thus, while the prospect of hu man genome editing to treat genetically inherited diseases has great appeal in some cases\u2014for example, those in which a single gene ca n be clearly identified as causal\u2014that is not true of th e majority of human diseases. ADVANTAGES OF GENOME EDITING OV ER TRADITIONAL GENE THERAPY AND EARLIER APPROACHES Gene therapy is the introduction of exogenous genes into cells w ith the goal of ameliorating a disease condition. This is most efficiently done using viral vectors that take advantage of a virus's natural ability to enter cells. The viral vectors are used to introduce a functional transgene and compensate the malfunction of an inherited mutant gene (gene replacement) or to instruct a novel function in the modified cells (gene a ddition). The vectors al so include exogenous Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 66 HUMAN GENOME COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL sequences (promoter) to drive transgene expressi on. Because viral vectors have a limited cargo capac ity, both the transgene and the pr omoter have to be modified from the natural version presen t in the genome and may thus fail to properly recapitulate physiological expression patterns. Ac cording to the choice of vector and type of target cells, the genetic modification may be transient, long-las ting or permanent. Permanent modification is achieved using lentiviral or gamm a-retroviral vectors that physica lly insert into the genome of the infected cells (integration). However, beca use insertion is semi-ra ndom, it may affect the function and expression of genes at or nearby the insertion site, t hus representing a potential risk (insertional mutagenesis). Current ly, tremendous progress is being made in gene therapy because of improved viral vectors, particularly lentiv iral and recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAV), and these strategies are be ing intensively investigated in the clinic. However, despite the fact that remarkable benefits are being reported in most treat ed patients (Naldini, 2015), more flexible and precise genetic modifications, such as those made possible by targeted genome editing, are needed to further improve the safety of gene therapy and broaden its application to the treatment of more diseases and conditions. Until the past decade, attempts to use genome modification in the treatment of genetically inherited disease, also called gene targeting, were performed by introducing a DNA template carrying the desired sequen ce into a cell population in culture, and then either allowing insertion at a random location or relying on rare homologous recombination events to incorporate that template sequence at an intended location in the genome. The DNA template generally was introduced into the cell using such systems as recombinant plasmids (small circular pieces of DNA) or viral vectors, which take advantage of a virus's natural ability to enter cells. The rare cells that acquired the desired sequence then had to be genetically selected and clonally expanded. Despite the limitations of this approa ch, the importance of gene targeting as an experimental tool is reflected in the broad use of homologous recombination to modify yeast, vertebrate cell lines, or even mice to genetically dissect a wide range of biological processes (Mak, 2007; Orr-Weaver et al., 1981). The frequency of successful gene targeting using these older strategies ranged from 10 -6 (1 in 1 million cells) for plasmid DNA to 10-2-10-3 (1 in 100 to 1 in 1,000 cel ls) using viral vectors (such as rAAV). When scientis ts modify DNA with a nuclease that makes a double-strand break (DSB) at a desired location in the genome, however, the frequenc y of successful genome editing increases dramatically (Carroll, 2014; Jasin, 199 6). Nuclease-based systems that make targeted genetic alterations are at the ro ot of the genome-editing technologi es discussed in this report. With nuclease-based editing systems, it is now possible to cut and, consequently, modify up to 100% of the desired target seque nce in the genome, either by sm all insertions or deletions introduced by the non-homologous end-joini ng DSB repair, or by relying on homologous recombination to introduce a new sequence at th e target site, albeit with a somewhat lower efficiency. These dramatic improve ments in efficiency have enabled scientists and clinicians to consider using genome editing for a greatly expanded range of app lications, including application to the treatment of diseases. Flexibility Nuclease-based genome editing encompasse s various methods for altering the DNA sequence of a cell. This editing can achieve several types of re sults, depending on where in the DNA the edits are made and for what purpose. Ch anges that can be made with genome editing include Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Safety and Effectiveness Nuclease-based genome editing may abrogate the risk of insertional mu tagenesis inherently associated with prior gene-replacement vectors that integrate quasi-randomly throughout the genome, although late-generation integrating vect ors used today may mitigate this risk. In addition, in situ gene correction of inherited mutations using genome editing reconstitutes both the function and the physiological co ntrol of expression of the mutant gene. This provides a safer and more effective correction strategy than ge ne replacement, in which expression of the therapeutic transgene is driven by a reconstituted artificial pr omoter. Such randomly inserted transgenes may fail to reproduce the physiological expression pattern faithfully, and they can be strongly influenced by the inser tion site, giving rise to substa ntial variegation of expression among a population of transduced ce lls. Indeed, one of the first poten tial applications of ex vivo genome editing may well be stem-cell-mediated correction of primary immunodeficiencies\u2014an improvement over prior transgenic approaches in which ectopic or constitutive expression of the therapeutic gene posed a risk of cancerous tran sformation or malfunction. If on-target editing frequencies of clinically releva nt cell types are high enough to be therapeutically useful, genome editing may eventually outperform gene replace ment (traditional gene therapy) in terms of safety, provided that off-target changes do not po se similar risks by modifying genes associated with cancer. Another potential broad applicati on of genome editing is precisel y targeted integration of a gene expression cassette into a so-called safe ge nomic harbor, chosen because it is conducive to robust transgene expression and allows a safe insert ion that does not have a detrimental effect on adjacent genes. This approach may ensure pred ictable and robust expres sion of a therapeutic gene without the risk of oncoge nesis caused by inadvertent insert ional activation of an oncogene. Targeted integration into a safe harbor and in situ correction of mutations are both potentially widely applicable to stem-cell-based therapies as long as the targeted cells are amenable to extensive in vitro culture selection and expans ion prior to clinical use. One can envisage increasing application of these t ypes of genome editing as the abil ity to grow and differentiate different types of cells in culture improves, part icularly in conjunction with differentiation from pluripotent cells (Hockemeyer and Jaenisch, 2016). 42Small insertions or deletions can be created to inactivat e an element; larger defined deletions can be created to remove entire elements; specific nucleotide substitutions can be made in the element; or new genetic elements can be inserted into precise locations in the genome.

Indee d, clinical testing of gene disr uption using zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) is already under way, with some indication of benefit for T-cells (Tebas et al., 2014), and this approach has recently been extended to hema topoietic stem cells (HSCs). These trials aim to disrupt expression of a cytokine receptor, C-C chemokine recepto r type 5 (CCR5), which also functions as a coreceptor for HI V infection and is not essentia l for T-cell function, thus making the T-cells of an HIV-infected indi vidual resistant to viral infection.43 Gene disruption could, in principle, also be used to eliminate a dominant disease-causing gene variant. Accessibility Multiple nuclease platforms have been develope d or improved in the last 5-10 years, making it likely that additional such platforms will be developed in the near future. The CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease platform, developed just since 2012, has generated significant optimism among research, clinical, and patient communities and has democratized genome editing, making it usable by many more laboratories. As a result , CRISPR/Cas9 has raised awareness of genome editing as a therapeutic tool and motivated cons ideration of the ethical and regulatory issues associated with its use (Baltimore et al., 2015; Corrigan-Curay et al ., 2015; Kohn et al., 2016). These issues are not new, however, nor are th ey specific to the CRISPR-Cas9 system; many of them have already been confronted and addresse d in the context of ea rlier gene therapy and genome editing applications. HOMOLOGOUS AND NONHOMOLOGOUS REPAIR METHODS USED FOR NUCLEASE-BASED GENOME EDITING Nuclease-based genome editing relies on the design of an artificial enzyme a nuclease to bind a specific target sequence in the genome where it create s either a DNA double-strand break or a DNA single-strand cut known as a \"nick.\" The cell usually repairs th e break through one of two major mechanisms: (1) nonhomologous end-join ing (NHEJ), which frequently inactivates the gene or genetic element dur ing the repair process; or (2) homology-based mechanisms, generically described as ho mology directed repair (HDR). (See also Chapter 3.) Genome editing by NHEJ creates an in sertion or deletion (\"indel\") at the break site that alters the sequence of the edited gene. Importantly, wh ile genome editing by NHEJ is precisely located by where the DNA break or nick is produced, it is not possible to pr edict the size or sequence of the resulting change in a single cell or the variability of the changes (indels) among a group of cells. In genome editing by HDR, a DNA template is used either to create one or more nucleotide changes, perhaps to match a known human refere nce sequence, or to insert a novel sequence (e.g., one or more genes) at a precise genomic location. In contrast to NHEJ, HDR-mediated 43There are six clinical trials involving the use of ZFNs to disrupt expression of CCR5. Three of these trials have been completed, one is ongoing, an d two are currently recruiting partic ipants.

Thus, HDR-mediated editing is analogous to editing a document because it enables precise changes in DNA sequence. POTENTIAL HUMAN APPLICATIONS OF SOMATIC CELL GENOME EDITING Genome-editing applications can be categorized based on several general features: Which cells or tissue(s) are modified \u2014in particular, whether the modification is made in somatic cells or tissues, which do not contribu te to future generations; in a germ cell or germ cell progenitor, which can result in herita ble changes passed to future children; or in a zygote, in which case both somatic and germ cells would be modified. (The focus here is on somatic editing; germline editi ng is discussed in Chapter 5.); Where the editing takes place \u2014in the test tube, followed by return of the cells or tissues to the individual (e x vivo), or directly in the person's body (in vivo); The specific goal(s) of the modification \u2014for example, to treat or prevent disease or to introduce additional or new traits. These goals may be achieved by modifying a pathogenic DNA variant to a known nonpathogeni c variant present in human reference sequences, or by modifying a gene to a sequen ce other than one that is a known existing human sequence; and The precise nature of the modification \u2014simple modification of a disease-causing mutation or risk-associated alle lic variant, or more a comple x change, such as disruption or ectopic/overexpression of an endogenous gene or addition of a novel function that augments a biological response or establis hes resistance to a di sease or pathogen. The intent of each of these modifications could be to treat or prevent a disease but could also be to modify (or, in principle, even create novel) phenotypic traits in the treated cells or tissues. It is important to note, for example, that one can use genome editing to achieve enhancement of a cellular property (e.g., secreting supranormal amounts of protein or resisting a viral infection) with the intent of curing a dis ease. Such cellular enhancement w ith intent to modify disease course needs to be distinguished from the concept of enhancement aimed at creating a desired or novel organismal feature in humans (a topi c discussed in detail in Chapter 6). Table 4-1 provides examples of the types of human diseases that might be treated using somatic cell genome editing. Even th ough this list is not comprehens ive, it highlights the broad range of potential applications. Clear examples of how genome editing might be applied to cure disease are to use homologous recombination to change the variant that causes sickle-cell disease back to the sequence that en codes wild-type hemoglobin (Dever et al., 2016; DeWitt et al., 2016) or correct the deficits in severe combined immune deficiencies (Booth et al ., 2016). A more subtle use of genome editing to correct a disease-causing variant is to insert the wild-type DNA copy of the mRNA (complementary or cDNA) into an endogenous locus to correct downstream mutations (Genovese et al., 2014; Hubbard et al., 2016; Porteus, 2016). Concerning the liver as a target organ, it has been shown th at targeted insertion of a clo tting factor transgene downstream of the promoter of the albumin gene in a fr action of hepatocytes may rescue the hemophilia bleeding phenotype in mouse models (Angue la et al., 2013; Sharma et al., 2015).

Several potential applic ations of genome therapy entail causing gene disruption, provided that the delivery of the nuclease does not lead to loss of the treated cells because of toxicity or immune rejection. Among these applications ar e the disruption of do minant mutations and expanded triplet repeats in some neurodegenerati ve diseases, such as Huntington's disease (Malkki, 2016), and the recons titution of a functional dystrop hin in Duchenne's muscular dystrophy by deletion or forced skipping of the exon carrying the disease-causing mutation (Long et al., 2016; Nelson et al., 2016; Tabebor dbar et al., 2016). Other examples include disruption of an endogenous gene repressor to resc ue expression of a fetal gene compensating for a defective adult form, as is currently being attempted by disrupting expression of BCL11A in the erythroid lineage; to rescue fetal globin expression to compensa te for the lack of expression of adult beta-globin in thalasse mia major; or to counteract the sickling beta globin mutant in sickle-cell anemia (Hoban et al., 2016). In T- cell immunotherapy, a promising application of genome editing is single or multiplex disruption of genes that may antagonize, counteract, or inhibit the activity of exogenous cell-surface recept ors introduced into T-cells to direct them against tumor-associated antigens (Qasim et al., 2017). These strategies can strongly potentiate current cell-based immunotherapy strategies, pos sibly overcoming current barriers that limit efficacy in most solid tumors. SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL CONSID ERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DESIGN AND APPLICATION OF GENOME-EDITING STRATEGIES All types of genome editing involve considerat ion of certain parameters that together determine the efficacy and potential toxicity of a genome-editing tool. These scientific and technical considerations inform ho w and why a particular approach is chosen to meet a research or therapeutic goal; they also impact the nature of the data that will be available for the regulatory evaluations that will be required for potential preclinical testing, clin ical trials, review, and ongoing oversight of these methods.

All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 72 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION Choice of Engineered Nuclease Platform The choice of nuclease includes the platform type, which can be based on protein-DNA recognition (e.g. meganucleases, ZFNs, or TALENs ) or on nucleic acid base-pairing recognition (e.g., CRISPR/Cas9), and the design and generation of the components that target the intended genomic sequence. When developing protein- based DNA-binding domains that are made using zinc fingers and TAL effectors, extensive en gineering and improvement are possible for each specific sequence-binding domain, su ch that it is difficult to make a general prediction on the performance and specificity of the overall platform. That is, for ZFNs and TALENs, optimization of performance (activity and specifi city) often requires work for each nuclease that may or may not translat e to another nuclease. In contrast, when RNA-based nucleases such as Cas9 are developed, general improvements are made to the platform itself and should transl ate to each specific target sequence. Because the only major difference among CRISPR-Cas9 systems is the targeting guide RNA, optimization of one Cas9 nuclease often will generalize to improved performance of other nucleases. This fact has implications for the ease or speed with which genome-editing systems designed for one clinical application could be adapted to target others. Delivery Strategy: Ex Vivo and In Vivo Genome Editing Genome editing can be carried out ex vivo or in vivo. In ex vivo editing, it is possible to conduct a number of checks on the edited cells before they are administered to a patient because the cells are first manipulated in the laboratory. Ex vivo editin g, which occurs outside the body, is suitable only for certain cell types, however. By contrast, in vivo editing allows other types of cells and tissues to be edited, but poses addi tional safety and technical challenges because it involves administering the genome- editing tool directly into a patient's body fluids (e.g., blood), body cavities, or organs in order to modify targeted cells in situ. Ex vivo genome editing can be performed by is olating and manipulating a population of the intended target cells outside the body and then transplanting those cells into an individual. The source of cells can be autologous or allogeneic : autologous cells are derived from the same individual, while allogeneic ce lls are derived from an immuno logically matched donor. Whether the cells are sourced from the same patient or a matched donor, the administered cells often have stem-cell-like properties, which may allow their self-renewal and long-term maintenance in vivo, as well as repopulation of the tr eated tissue with their genetically modified progeny. In some approaches, the cells can be treated in culture to induce commitment or differentiation toward a desired cell type or lineage before being administ ered to the patient. Otherwise, the edited cells can be differentiated somatic cells, such as short-lived or long-liv ed immune effector cells that are expanded and genetically modified ex vivo to enhance their activity against a tumor or infectious agent. Several somatic cell types ha ve been isolated, gene tically modified, and transplanted, including blood-forming hemat opoietic (blood) stem and progenitor cells, fibroblasts, stem cells), neural stem cells, and mesenchymal stromal/stem cells. This list likely will grow as scientif ic knowledge and techniques improve. An expanded repertoire of cell types has the potential to increase the range of possible ex vivo genome-editing applications. In in vivo genome editing, the editing machiner y that needs to be delivered to the cells includes the nuclease that cuts the DNA and, in the case of CRISPR/Cas9, the guide RNA that targets the editing to a specific genomic location.

Target of in vi vo genome editing may include long-lived tissue-specific cells, such as muscle fibers, liver hepatocytes, neurons of the central nervous system, or photoreceptors in the retina, but may also include rare, tissue-specific stem cells and other types of cells that cannot easily be harvested and transplanted. Relativ e to ex vivo approaches, however, in vivo approaches pose greater challenges with respec t to efficient delivery of the genome-editing machinery to the right cells in the body, ensuring that the correct location in the genome has been successfully edited, and minimizing errors resulting from off-target editing. Additional Considerations A number of additional scientific and technical considerations re lated to both ex vivo and in vivo genome editing inform the developm ent of human genome-editing systems. Ability to Isolate the Relevant Cell Types To carry out ex vivo genome editing, it is neces sary first to isolate the relevant cell types from an appropriate tissue source or to generate them from pluripotent stem cells, and then to grow and modify them ex vivo and finally administer them to the patient so that they can engraft and/or deliver the intended bi ological activity. There are seve ral advantages to the ex vivo strategy: only the intend ed cells are exposed to the editing reagents, there is a wide choice of delivery platforms that can best be fitted to each cell type and application, and it is possible to characterize and even purify a nd expand the edited cells before administration. Currently this process has been established for only a few cell t ypes, including cells that will eventually give rise to skin, bone, muscle, blood, and neurons. The range of possible ex vivo genome-editing applications will expand with the development of scientific knowledge about how to isolate additional primary cell types and derive other cell types from pluripotent cells, grow the cells ex vivo, and ultimately successfully and safely transplant them ba ck into patients. Ex vivo genome-editing strate gies, have a number of expected limitations, which are common to all attempts at culturing cells ex vivo. These limitations include the need for prolonged culture and expansion from a few cells or even a single founder cell, both of which entail the risk of accumulating mutations, as well as incurring replicative exhaustion. This issue is particularly relevant for genome editing becau se inducing double-strand ed breaks to DNA, as is required for initiating the process, may itself trigger such cellular res ponses as apoptosis (cell death), differentiation (changing cell type), cell senescence (aging), and replicative arrest (cells stop dividing). All of these cellular responses ar e detrimental to cell expansion and maintenance of pluripotency. These limitations represent si gnificant hurdles to ex vivo genome editing because most therapeutic applications require substantial numbers of cells for infusion. Overcoming these hurdles will require better ways to culture cells, better understanding of the safety risks associated with genomic accrual of random mutations in these settings, and reliable assays for assessing such events. Additional hurdles are th e ability to fully control the commitment and differentiation of cells in culture and their purification from the sour ce pluripotent cells. This is an important consideration because administration of immature cells may be associated with a risk of tumorigenesis or failure to integrat e functionally within the tissue. Despite these limitations, ex vivo genome editing has the advantage that cells with the desired alteration can be selected and the accuracy of the alterations valid ated before transplantation to the patient.

All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 74 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION Ability to Control Biodistribu tion of the Genome-Editing Tool Additional considerations for in vivo genome editing are linked to the choice of the delivery platform for the editing machinery because this choice impacts the extent, time course, and in vivo biodistribution of the genome- editing tool. This considerati on has major implications for potential efficacy, acute and l ong-term toxicity, and immunogen icity and even the risk of unintentional editing of germ cells . Efficient editing of the intende d genomic site usually requires a high level of intracellu lar nuclease expression, ev en though this often can be for only a short time to prevent excess toxicity and off-target ac tivity. Whereas short-term, high expression of the genome-editing nuclease can be obtained relatively eas ily for cells cultured in vitro, it is more challenging in vivo. Finally, in an in vivo setting there could be unintentional (inadvertent) modification of the germ cells or primordial germ cells; therefore, pre-clinical development of in vivo editing should address the risk of modification of germ cells resulting in heritable changes that could be passed along to fu ture generations and minimize th is potential risk in humans enrolled in clinical trials. In general, the risk of germline transmission associated with the administration of ex vivo gene edited cells is likely to be low if one can show that the editing reagents do not remain associated with the treated cells and are not shed in active form at the time of administration. In these conditions, non-clinical st udies of germline transmission may not be necessary. On the other hand, in vivo administration of editing reagen ts would require assessment of their potential biodistribution to the gonads and activity on germ cell genomes. These parameters will be strongly influenced by the deliver y platforms used and the timing and route of delivery. When viral vectors are used to deliver the nuclease, the preclinical studies might take into consideration accumulating knowledge from animal and human studies concerning the potential of these vectors to reach germline cells. Pr eclinical studies in animal models such as non-human primates could be designed to monitor both the biodistributi on of the vector/vehicle as well the activity of the nuclease in cells from off-target tissues, including the gonads. A suggested approach to studying the potential of germline transmission in such nonclinical models can follow a decision tree, in which a positive finding triggers the next level of investigation. One could start from investigating the presence of the reagent and/or genomic signs (indels) of its activity in the gonads, then identifying their actual occurrence in germ cells isolated from the positive gonads, the transient or sustained occurrence of this finding and, eventually, th e transmission of the genetic modification to the viable progeny of th e treated animals. Molecular assays could be designed to track the occurrence of indels at th e intended or surrogate nuclease target sites, provided that such sites exist in the genome of the species used for the study with sufficient affinity for the nuclease to support the sensitiv ity of the assay. Many limitations exist when conducting such studies in surrogate animal sp ecies, as already discovered for several gene therapy products, including the low sensitivit y of the available assays, species-specific differences in vehicle biodistribution and access to the gonadal cells, and the general difficulties of testing transmission to the female vs. male germline. Because of these limitations, regardless of the outcome of non-clinical biodistributi on data, contraceptive measures are usually recommended (if meaningful or applicable) for patients undergoing in vivo gene therapy clinical trials at least for the expected time of clearance of the administ ered vector/vehicle from the body fluids, and usually extended to encompass at least one cycle of spermatogenesis, which is approximately 64-74 days in men. Testing of se men can be done at various time points during this time interval and, if samples are positive, should continue and the respective regulatory Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

On the other hand, there are currently no non-invasive means to monitor women for germline transmission. Ability to Limit Immune Response to Deli very Vectors or Genome-Editing Proteins In vivo delivery of proteins and nucleic acids is currently done with either of two types of platforms. The first is based on chemical conjugates (lipo- and/or glyco-complexes) that provide short-lived but relatively inefficient expressi on across multiple different tissue types, although advances have been achieved in ta rgeting specific cell type s, such as liver (Yin et al., 2014). This approach can expose therapeutically irrelevant cell ty pes in the patient to th e potential toxicity of the nuclease. The second type of platform relie s on viral vectors that can provide robust and tissue-specific expression, but they also are fre quently long-lived and more likely to provoke an immune response. Self-complementary rAAV8 v ectors (scAAV), for example, have been shown to mediate continued expression of the engine ered nuclease. Sustained nuclease expression increases the risk of DNA damage and genotoxi city, with subsequent potential risk of widespread (albeit possibly slow ) cell death or malignant transformation of the patient's cells. Moreover, all current formulations of editing machinery contain elements that are derived from proteins of common microbial pathogens, whic h could trigger primar y or secondary immune responses in treated individuals. As has been well documented in viral gene therapy studies, immune recognition of viral vector proteins may lead to rapid a nd complete clearance of cells that have received the editing machinery, which eliminates the benefit of the treatment. The risk of clearance of the edited cells is exacerba ted by preexisting immunity and by the extent and duration of expression of the antigen. Ability to Make Genome Edits in Nondividing Cells Another major hurdle for both ex vivo and in vivo editing is that targ eted insertion of a DNA sequence into postmitotic cells, such as neurons, is not feasible because of their low or absent homologous recombination activity. In contrast, NHEJ, which is active in nondividing cells, has been harnessed mainly for the generation of i ndels to inactivate a gene. However, NHEJ can, with modifications to the methods, be used to generate site-specifi c gene insertions (e.g., Maresca et al., 2013; Suzuki et al., 2016a). Mo st recently, it was reported that one of these methods, Homology-Independent Targ eted gene Integration, or HI TI, allows targeted knock-in of DNA sequences in dividing cells (e.g., stem cells ), and most importantly, in non-dividing cells (e.g., neurons) both in vitro and in vivo (Suzuki et al., 2016a). In vivo gene editing is a highly sought-after applicat ion that has been shown to be feasible and potentially therapeutic in so me mouse models. Substantial challenges to its translation to the clinic remain, however, at least in the current modalities of administration. Also considering the well-known difficulties in predicti ng immune response in animal models, stable expression of nucleases, despite being apparently well tolera ted in some animal models, may not be the preferred route to c linical development Assessment of the Activity and Specificity of Genome Editing Each targeting nuclease can be characterized by the efficiency and specificity of DNA cleavage . Efficiency can be relatively easily meas ured (by sequencing the targeted site. Specificity reflects on-target versus off-target site activity, which al so can be measured by various assays, each with advantages and disa dvantages (see Appendix A for details). While Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 76 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION whole-genome sequencing could be the gold standard for analyzi ng single cells or clones, the depth of this sequencing is not su fficient to assess the off-target spectrum in popula tions of cells. Comparing Off-Target Editing Rate with the Natural Mutation Rate of the Human Genome It is important to note that accurate assessment of the specificity of a genome-editing approach requires that mutations created by th e genome-editing process be distinguished from those that occur spontaneously throughout a life span. The natu ral error frequency of normal genome replication varies among sites in the genome but is approximately 10-10 per base per round of DNA replication. Because each human ce ll contains approximate ly 6 billion DNA base pairs, even the naturally low error rate means th at DNA replication can be expected to generate, on average, approximately one or a few de novo mutations in each round of cellular replication. Thus as cells proliferate, they naturally accumula te mutations at this rate. In addition to this background mutation frequency, a significant amount of DNA damage results from normal environmental exposures such as radiation, ox idative stress, and DNA-damaging agents in the environment. A direct comparison between th e mutation frequency generated by a genome- editing nuclease and the spontaneous mutation fre quency has not yet been conducted, but results from this type of analysis are likely to depe nd on the specific nuclease in question and on which cell type is examined. The error rate of nuclease technologies c ontinues to improve and may at some point, if it is not already, be less than the spontaneous mutation frequency. Measuring Efficiency and Specificity for Each Delivery Platform For genome-editing applications, the system (nuclease and targeting sequences) must be delivered inside cells. Because th e choice of delivery platform de termines the extent, level, and time course of expression of the genome-edi ting machinery, it affects the efficiency and specificity displayed in a given set of experime ntal conditions and furthermore determines the toxicity and immunogenicity profile . In addition, several intrinsic f eatures of the chosen delivery platform (DNA, RNA, or protein; delivery mechanism) also influe nce its potential toxicity (see Table A-1 in Appendix A). These effects usually are due to normal innate target-cell responses to exogenous molecules, and they often are stronger for DNA especially DNA plasmids than for RNA or proteins. The innate responses to viruses may vary with virus and cell type: usually they are very low for AAV or lentivirus in human somatic cells (Kajaste-R udnitski and Naldini, 2015), with the exception of some immune cell types, such as de ndritic cells and macrophages, which have a large complement of built-in viral sensors and may trigger interferon and inflammatory responses (Rossetti et al., 2012). Th e purity and composition of reagents (plasmid versus linearized DNA, mutant bases in RNA, high performance liquid chromatography [HPLC] purification of components) also can play a significant role. Finally, the frequency with whic h the intended target sequence and related sequences occur in the genome and the local chromatin environment at the target site also can influence the efficiency and specificity of a genome-editing approach. All the factors mentioned above are likely to vary according to the treated cell type and modality (ex vivo versus in vivo). Moreover, the ratio of on- to off-target activity also is a ffected by the intrinsic biology of the targeted cell type, including differences in cell-cycle status, DNA-damage responses, a nd repair capability.

All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance SOMATIC GENOME EDITING 77 PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION Preclinical Studies to Asse ss Efficiency and Specificity In the development of human genome editing app lications, preclinical st udies are undertaken to establish the activity and specificity of each editing nuclease system. The design of these preclinical studies is influenced by the choice of target cells and experimental conditions, and the results should be viewed as providing relative rath er than absolute values. An additional caveat is that most of these preclinical studies measure nuclease activity and specificity over a large population of cells, among which nuclease expression will vary. Because the ratio of on- to off- target activity also varies with nuclease expr ession level, the cells with higher nuclease expression may have a less favorable ratio since the on-target activity will saturate, while activity at off-target sites becomes more evident. On the other hand, cells w ith lower expression may exhibit a more favorable ratio because activity is evident mainly at the intended target site. This consideration suggests that the dose dependence of on- and off-ta rget rates be considered as part of the process of validating a genome-editing approach. Assessment of nuclease specificity will continue to evolve as scientific knowledge and techniques improve. From an operational standpoin t as of this writing (late 2016), however, the following represents a reasonable appr oach to conducting this assessment: Use both bioinformatics and unbiased screens to identify potential off-target sites (see Appendix A). Use deep sequencing of both cell lines and the primary target cell type to determine the frequency of indels at both on- and off-target sites (validation). Evaluate validated off-target sites for potenti al biological effects, and eliminate nucleases that generate off-target activity at sites that could be predicted to have biologic effects. It should be noted that most off-target sites identified to date lie in non-protein coding regions of the genome, making their f unctional importance difficult to assess. Use assays that measure gross chromosoma l integrity, such and translocation assays. These assays are limited in being relatively insensitive. Use diverse functional assays of the target ce lls of interest to measure risk of clonal dominance and to assess the actual feasibil ity, efficiency, and toxicity of the genome- editing manufacturing process. It is important to note that to develop a genome- editing approach for clinical use, it may not be necessary or feasible to conduct comprehensiv e efficiency and specificity studies performed at high-enough sensitivity to captu re all possible off-target edits. Ongoing work in standard gene therapy, for example, has indicated that uncontrolle d lentiviral insertions, which cause even more disruptive changes than non-homol ogous repair of a double-strand break, may be relatively safe and well tolerated in several types of cells and tissues. This is tr ue even when large numbers of insertions (up to 10 8 or 109 per patient) are introduced. A furt her consideration is that the off- target activity is dependent on the sequence. Mu ch of the early preclinical testing aimed at establishing targeting efficacy and specificity has been carried out in nonhuman organisms, especially mice. However, the genomes of humans and mice are sufficiently divergent that assessment of the specificity of engineered nucleases in the ge nomes of mice or other rodents may have somewhat limited predictive power for the same genome-editing approach in humans.

Geno me-editing strategies are in competition with other therapeutic approaches, including small molecule therapies; biologics; and most notably other gene th erapy approaches, such as lent iviral vectors and rAAV vectors used for gene replacement. In the end, therefore, each strategy will need to be evaluated against the others in terms of effi cacy, risk, cost, and feasibility . ETHICAL AND REGULATORY ISSUES POSED BY SOMATIC CELL GENOME EDITING In most respects, somatic cell genome editing wi ll be developed with the benefit of gene therapy's robust base of techni cal knowledge, and w ithin the existing system of regulatory oversight and ethical norms that have facilitated the current research and clinical development of somatic cell and gene therapy around the world, including Australia, China, Europe, Japan, and the United States (see Chapter 2). These regulato ry systems include a wide range of preclinical models and study designs to suppor t the clinical development of therapies based on edited cells, as well as a roadmap for first-in-human c linical testing and eventual marketing. Regulatory Oversight in the United States As described in Chapter 2, clinical testing of somatic cell genome editing could not begin in the United States without the Food and Drug Administration's first having approved an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, and the clinical protocol would require IRB approval and ongoing review (FDA, 1993). In additi on, the reviews by the National Institutes of Health's Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (R AC) inform the deliberations of the FDA and IRBs, and provides a venue fo r public discussion. Other countries have similar pathways, as described in Chapter 2, albeit with some variations in the stage of research at which a cell-based therapeutic can be marketed and the terms under which it can be withdrawn. The question of approval for clinical use hinge s largely on identifying wh en benefits may be expected to outweigh risks when used as labeled and as intended (Califf, 2017). Clinical trial data is increasingly reviewed w ithin a structured framework that identifies need, alternatives, areas of uncertainty, and avenues for risk management.44 According to former FDA Commissioner Robert Califf, \"F DA product review teams must we igh scientific and clinical evidence and consider conflicting stakeholder and societal pers pectives about the value of benefits and the tolerability of risks. They mu st consider the existence and effectiveness of alternative treatments, disease se verity, risk tolerance of affect ed patients, and potential for additional insight from postmarket data. Such de cisions require seeking the appropriate balance between high-quality evidence and early access, between benefit and risk, between protecting the US public and encouraging innovation that ma y improve health outcomes\" (Califf ,2017). 44Structured Approach to Benefit-Risk Decision-Making, PDUFA V Plan (FY 2013-2017).

All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance SOMATIC GENOME EDITING 79 PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION Approval of a gene therapy may depend upon how carefully risks and benefits can be monitored once it enters clinical use. On this topic, the FDA has issued an influential (though non-binding) guidance for gene thera py trials that would have rele vance to genome editing trials (FDA 2006). Long-term follow-up is not always re quired, for example when preclinical data on such things as vector sequence, integration and potential for late ncy demonstrates that long-term risks are very low. But when long-term risks are present, \"a gene therap y clinical trial must provide for long-term follow-up observations in order to mitigate those risks.\" Without such a plan for long-term follow-up observations, the risk s would be unreasonable and (presumably) the trial not approvable. Where mer ited, the guidance suggests a 15-year period of post-trial contact, observation and physical exams (though this can be shortened based on factors such as vector persistence, or when subjects are predicted to ha ve only short-term surviv al). Prior to enrolling, subjects must give voluntary, informed cons ent to long-term follow-up, and while they may withdraw at any time, it is hoped they will comply. Once approved by the FDA for particular popula tions and indications, gene-based therapies would be subject to postmarke t monitoring and adverse event reporting, and special warnings added or the products withdrawn co mpletely if shown to be unsaf e or ineffective. In addition, postmarket risk evaluation and mitigation strategi es (REMSs), such as requiring physicians to have special proficiency or requiri ng patients to be entered into a registry, could be required if significant safety concerns would preclude approval absent these extra controls. Off-label use of cells subjected to genome ed iting would be legal in the United States, in Europe, and in other countries, a nd is probably to be expected with respect to patient populations (for example, if approved for adults, use mi ght well be extended off-label to pediatric populations) or for varying degrees of severity of the disease indication. 45 The prospect of off- label use has led to speculation about uncontrolled expansion of th e technology into uses that are unsafe, unwise, unnecessary, or unfair. And it is true that off-label use, while an important aspect of innovative medicine, can at times lead to uses that lack a rigorous evid entiary basis. But the specificity of these edited cells may limit the ra nge of off-label uses fo r unrelated indications more than is the case with many drugs.46 While one might imagine a cell therapy based on genome editing for muscular dystrophy being of possi ble interest to those with healthy muscle tissue who wish to become even stronger, other ex amples are more difficult to envision, at least for the near future. This point is of particular relevance to concerns about uses that go beyond restoration or maintenance of ordinary health (d iscussed in Chapter 6) be cause the specificity of edited cells will make such appli cations less likely at this time. Several technical challenges f aced in moving somatic genome edit ing toward clinical testing have already been met by conventional somatic gene therapy. Concerning ex vivo strategies, they are based on modifying human cell types and thus can be tested only in in vitro culture models or upon xenotransplant of the modified cells into immunocompromised mice. These studies interrogate cell viabilit y, biodistribution, and biological function in vivo, including self- renewal, multipotency, and clonogenicity, all crucia l features of stem cells. In vivo strategies may require preclinical testing of toxicity a nd biodistribution in nonhuman primates, including evidence that unintentional modification of the germ line does not occur. Indeed, the field of gene therapy has determined that in vivo approaches that would lead to unintentional modification of 45The FDA recently held a public hearing to discuss its regulations and policies on manufacturer communications about unapproved or off-label uses of medical products, including cell-based therapies (FDA, 2016a). 46Communication, FDA, December 15, 2016.

Note, however , that most assays of germline transmission have low sensitivity, and thus a certain degree of uncertainty may have to be managed in considering clinical deve lopment and regulation. Several guidance documents have been publishe d by regulatory authorities in the U.S. and Europe and by the Internationa l Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) to illustrate the general principles for investigating and addressing the ri sks for inadvertent germlin e integration of gene therapy products in non-clinical studies, and provide considerati ons to minimize this potential risk in humans enrolled in clinical tria ls (EMEA, 2006; FDA, 2012a; ICH, 2006). Such guidelines may be suitably adapted to design preclinical studies of somatic genome editing strategies. In an effort to speed the development of regenerative medicine, a new public-private partnership has been launched. The Internati onal Standards Coordinati ng Body was established \"to advance process, measurement, and analytical techniques to support th e global availability of cell, gene, tissue-engineered, and regenerative medicine products, and cel l-based drug discovery products. Creating standards creates a more unifo rm compliance environment and addresses and assists in future efforts for harmonization in ternationally of the re gulatory framework for submissions across the globe.\" 47 The sectors of activity includ e genetic modification of cells, with specific mention of standards for measuri ng off-target events in genome editing (Werner and Plant, 2016). Regulating Somatic Genome Edit ing by Approach and Indication An ethical and regulatory assessment of futu re somatic genome-editing applications may depend on both the technical approach to the edi ting and the intended indication. Like traditional gene therapy, somatic genome editing could be used to revert an underlyi ng genetic mutation to a variant not associated with dise ase, which would result in a fraction of the targeted cells regaining normal function. Somatic genome editing also could be used to engineer a cell so that its phenotype differed from that of a normal cell and was better able to resist or prevent disease. For example, a cell could be changed so that it made above-normal amounts of a protein, or so that it was resistant to a viral infection. Both ex vivo and in vivo approaches to genome editing could be applied to treat or prevent a disease. In addition, genome editing could be used to alter a trait not associated with disease (see Chapter 6). Regardless of the final framework used to assess human somatic cell genome-editing applications, it is vital that the regulatory oversight mechanisms have sufficient legal authority and enforcement capability to identify and block unauthorized applications. To date, the existing structures have been successful in preventing una uthorized applications of gene therapy and the current framework provides guidance on key el ements. Although human genome editing may be somewhat more difficult to control than traditiona l gene therapy because technical advances have made the editing steps easier to pe rform, the cellular manipulations and delivery of edited cells to the patient continue to demand high-quality labo ratory and medical facilities, which generally will ensure that regulatory oversight is in place. 47See http://www.regenme dscb.org (accessed January 10, 2017).

In part this is due to some of the past unduly optimistic statements about the near-term prospects of rege nerative medicine, in part to the presence of unregulated jurisdictions, and in part to some resistance\u2014at least in the United States\u2014to the regulatory authority of the govern ment. In the United States, fede ral courts have confirmed the FDA's jurisdiction over the use of manipulated ce lls, but this is still the subject of some confusion.48 Edited cells\u2014particularly those taken from a patient and then returned to that patient\u2014may engender the same confusion about wh ether this is a regulated product or merely the practice of medicine, and the regulatory auth ority needs to be made clear from the outset. Overall, then, regulatory bodies need the legal authority, leadership commitment, and political support to apply their legal power s to halt the marketing of therapies that use human genome- editing products that have not undergone regul atory review and approval (Charo, 2016b). With regard to stem-cell therapies, there has been considerable concern about the absence of vigorous use of enforcement powers by the FDA (Turner and Knoepfler, 2016), although Italy's experience with closing down one clinic has illustrated the leve l of legal and political power needed to do this (Margottini, 2014). Special Considerations Associated with Genome Editing in Fetuses In certain situations, either the most effectiv e or the only approach would be to attempt to edit the somatic cells of a fetus prior to deliver y. Diseases for which these special circumstances might apply include those that are multisystemic or have an extremely early onset that would make postnatal intervention too late to benefit the child or are extremely challenging from a technical standpoint. In addition, because of th e tremendous developmental plasticity of the fetus, fetal editing might be more effective than postnatal editing in certain circumstances. An example would be attempting to re vert a disease-causing variant th at affects every neuron in the brain. In a more general sense, the therapeutic edit ing process could be car ried out ex vivo in a scenario in which cells could be harvested fr om the fetus, edited ou tside the body, and then transplanted back into the fetus. Currently, established met hods for isolating and transplanting autologous fetal cells are available for a limited nu mber of cell types, but the range of cell types is likely to increase in the future. Therapeutic editing in fetuses also could be performed in vivo, in which case the editing machinery would be delivered to the fetus to modi fy cells in situ. As noted above, the in situ correction of a disease-causing variant early in development has the potential to be more effective than postnatal in vivo editing, when many organ systems are more fully developed. In utero stem cell therapy has been tried (with limited success) (Couzin-Frankel, 2016; Waddington et al., 2005), so the general con cept of in utero therapy with emerging areas of medicine has already undergone some ethical analysis.

All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 82 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION Immunology Society has been formed, which holds annual meetings to review prospects and progress for fetal gene therapy.49 Although fetal genome editing has potential advant ages, at least two sp ecial ethical issues would need to be addressed: sp ecial rules for consent (see Chapte r 2) and the increased risk of causing heritable changes to the germline by causi ng modification of germ cells or germ cell progenitor/stem cells. With regard to consent, key issues have b een addressed by existing oversight mechanisms, fetal surgery has already been used in clinical car e, and in utero fetal ge ne therapy is attracting increasing interest (McClain, 2016; Waddington, 2005). The risk/ben efit calculation is shifted relative to a postnatal or adult intervention, with the degree of risk to which a fetus can be subjected being strictly limited when there is no pr ospect of medical benef it to the future child. When such benefit is possible, however, the more usual standards for risk/benefit balance apply. Decisions about fetal surgery have been made with the understanding that the pregnant woman has the ethical and legal authority to give inform ed consent. In the United States, as in other countries, maternal consent is required (Al ghrani and Brazier, 2011; O'Connor, 2012), and when research is aimed at maternal health as well, maternal consent alone is sufficient.50 In the United States, however, NIH-funded research is subject to special regula tions set forth at 45 CFR Part 46, Subpart B, and paternal consent (if available) also is required if the research holds out the prospect of benefit solely to the fetus. Even when not funded by NIH, many studies in the United States employ these same rules. A second issue is the challenge of assessi ng whether unintended germline editing has occurred if in vivo somatic editing is attemp ted in a fetus. A key feature of germline cell development is that the primordial cells that will give rise to germ cells are sequestered from somatic cells at key developmental points. Befo re this sequestration of germline and somatic cells occurs or has been finalized in early de velopment, germline cells might be edited as efficiently as would be the desire d somatic cell targets. As a result , there could be a higher risk of unintentional edits to germline cells early in fe tal development compared with performing the same intervention later in fetal development. It might be possible onl y to assess postnatally whether editing of germ cells or germ cell progenitors had occu rred, at which time it would be too late to change the outcome. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS In general, there is substantial public support for the use of gene therapy (and by extension, gene therapy that uses genome editing) for the treat ment and prevention of disease and disability. Human genome editing in somatic cells holds gr eat promise for treati ng or preventing many diseases and for improving the safety, effectiven ess, and efficiency of existing gene therapy techniques now in use or in clinical trials. While genome-editing techniques continue to be optimized, however, they are best suited only to tr eatment or prevention of disease and disability and not to other less pressing purposes. The ethical norms and regulatory regimes alread y developed for gene therapy can be applied for these applications.

Regulatory oversi ght also will need to include legal authority and enforcement capacity to prevent unauthorized or premature applications of genome editing, and regulatory authorities will ne ed to continually update their knowledge of specific technical aspects of the technologies being applied. At a minimum, their assessments will need to consider not only the technical context of the genome-editing system but also the proposed clinical application so that anticipated ri sks and benefits can be weighed. Because off-target events will vary with the platform technology, cell type, ta rget genome sequence, and other factors, no single standard for somatic genome-editing specif icity (e.g., acceptable off-target event rate) can be set at this time. RECOMMENDATION 4-1. Existing regulat ory infrastructure and processes for reviewing and evaluating somatic gene therapy to treat or prevent disease and disability should be used to eval uate somatic gene therapy that uses genome editing. RECOMMENDATION 4-2. At this time, regulatory authorities should authorize clinical trials or approve ce ll therapies only for indications related to the treatment or prevention of disease or disability. RECOMMENDATION 4-3. Oversight authorit ies should evaluate the safety and efficacy of proposed human somati c cell genome-editing applications in the context of the risks and benefits of intended use, recognizing that off- target events may vary with the pl atform technology, cell type, target genomic location, and other factors. RECOMMENDATION 4-4. Transparent and inclusive public policy debates should precede any consideration of whet her to authorize clinical trials of somatic cell genome editing for indi cations that go beyond treatment or prevention of dise ase or disability.

Thousands of genetically inherited diseases are caused by mutations in single genes.52 While individually, many of these ge netically inherited diseases are rare, collectively they affect a sizable fraction of the popul ation (about 5-7 percent). The emotional, financial, and other burdens on indivi dual families that result from transmission of such serious genetic disease can be considerable, and for some families could potentially be alleviated by germline editing. Recent advances in the development of genome-editing techniques have made it realistic to contempl ate the eventual feasibility of applying these techniques to the human germline. As discusse d elsewhere in this report, improvements in genome-editing techniques are driving increases in the efficiency and accuracy of genome editing while also decreasing the risk of off-ta rget events. Because germline genome edits would be heritable, however, their effects could be mu ltigenerational. As a result, both the potential benefits and the potential harms could be multip lied. In addition, the notion of intentional germline genetic alteration has occasioned si gnificant debate about the wisdom and appropriateness of this form of human interv ention, and speculation about possible cultural effects of the technology. As discussed below, these include concerns about diminishing the dignity of humans and respect for their variety; failing to appreci ate the importance of the natural world; and a lack of humility about our wisdom and powers of control when altering that world or the people within it (Skerrett, 2015). A similar debate is already under way regarding a related set of techniques\u2014mitochondrial replacement\u2014in which genetic disease carried by mitochondrial DNA is avoided by using heal thy mitochondria from a donor. Because mitochondria in the egg are passed down materna lly through the generations , the effect of these techniques is to make a heritable genetic change , albeit one that does not change the DNA in the nucleus. Mitochondrial replacement has been used in Mexico (Hamzelou, 2016) and Ukraine 51\"Germline editing\" refers to all manipulations of germline cells; primordial germ cells [PGCs], gamete progenitors, (see \"Heritable germline editing,\" a form of germline editing that includes transfer of edited material for gestation, with the intent to generate a new human being possessing the potential to transmit the \"edit\" to future generations, is discussed in this chapter. The distinction turns on intent rather than on the technological intervention, which is highly similar in both cases. 52See https://www.omim.org (accessed Janu ary 3, 2017) and http://w ww.diseaseinfosearch.org (accessed January 4, 2017).

A recent National Academies study led to the recommendation that mitochondrial replacement be permitted to proceed to clinical tria ls in the United States provided it is subject to strict criteria and oversight (IOM, 2016) (see Box 5-1). In ea rly 2017, there were reports of a child born after use of the technique in the Ukraine, in this case for an infertility-related condition that would not have met the criteria laid out by either the HFEA or the National Academies report (Coghlan, 2017). BOX 5-1 Mitochondrial Replacement Techniques A technique for mitochondrial replacement already has engendered fresh discussion of heritable genetic modification. All people have DNA in the nucleus that encodes most of our traits, but also a very small amount of DNA in the mitochondria within our cells. A variety of diseases are caused when mutated mitochondria are passed from parent to child through the mother's egg. Replacing these defective mitochondria with normal mitochondria from another woman's egg allows for conception of children with vastly reduced risk of inherited disease while satisfying prospective parents' desire for genetically related offspring. Sons could not pass along the donated mitochondria to their own future children, but daughters could, through their now-modified eggs, thus rendering this a potentia lly heritable form of germline alteration. A 2016 IOM committee recommended pursuing a cautious, incremental approach, with trials limited to situations involving a known risk of passing along serious disease. It also recommended initially limiting the technique's use to male embryos, so that any effects of the donation would be experienced only by the first generation of children. With additional research and evidence of safety, it concluded, this coul d be expanded to a heritable form of MRT that includes female embryos. The United Kingdom's Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has also reviewed the MRT procedures, and concluded that they are robust enough to proceed with either male or female embryos, although to date the procedure has been approved but not yet performed. This chapter begins by reviewing potential appl ications of and alternatives to heritable genome editing. It then describes in turn scientific and technical issues, et hical and social issues, and potential risks associated with these applicat ions. The chapter then tu rns to the regulation of heritable genome editing. The final section presents conclusions and a recommendation. POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS AND ALTERNATIVES Preventing Transmission of Inherited Genetic Disease Opinions differ as to whether germline genom e editing should be used to prevent the transmission of inherited genetic diseases. Germline genome editing is not the only way to accomplish this goal. Other options include decidi ng not to have children; adopting a baby; or using donated embryos, eggs, or sperm. These options, however, do not allow both parents to have a genetic connection to their children, which is of great importance to many people. Alternatively, in vitro fertiliza tion (IVF) with preimp lantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of the embryos can be used to identify affected embryos so that parents can choose to implant only those embryos that are free of the diagnosed muta tion. This option is not without potential risks and costs, however, and it also involves discarding affected embryos, which some find Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance HERITABLE GENOME EDITING 87 PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION unacceptable. One can also avoid transmitting genetic mutations to the next generation by using prenatal genetic diagnosis of the fetus followed by selective abortion of affe cted fetuses. But as with PGD, some people find it unacceptable to terminate an ongoing pregnancy regardless of the predicted health of the future child. In these situations, for those who are aware they are at ri sk of passing on such a mutation, the use of heritable germline genome editing offers a potential avenue to having genetically related children who are free of the mutatio n of concern. This form of ed iting could be done either in gametes (eggs, sperm), in gamete precursors, or in early embryos, but it is important to note that IVF procedures would be required to generate embryos for subsequent genomic modification. In most cases, PGD could be used to id entify unaffected embryos to implant. However, there are some situations where all or a majority of embryos will be affected, rendering PGD difficult or impossible. For exampl e, dominant late-onset genetic diseases, like Huntington's disease, can occur at high enough fre quency in some isolated populations that one parent will be homozygous for the mutation. In such situations, all em bryos would carry the dominant disease-causing allele th at would cause the disease in th e children. PGD is not useful in this situation. In other populations, the frequency of particul ar disease-causing mutations may be high enough that there is a significant chance that both prospective parents will be carriers of mutations in the same gene. Examples includ e the tumor suppressor genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, which increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer even when inhe rited in a single copy (because of loss of the unaffected copy of the ge ne) and Tay-Sachs disease and other early-onset lysosomal storage diseases that are caused by the inheritance of two copies of recessive mutations. In these situations, only one in four of the embryos would be free of a disease-causing mutation. Those unaffected embryos could be id entified by PGD, but the number of embryos potentially available for implantation would be si gnificantly reduced. There are also examples of diseases that are caused by pairing of two diffe rent mutations in a given gene, known as \"co- dominance,\" and combinations of specific allele s of two or more genes, in which PGD becomes more difficult. As the survival of people with severe recessive diseases like cystic fibrosis, sickle-cell anemia, thalassemia, and lysosomal storage diseases improves with advances in medical treatments, the possibility cannot be dismissed that there will be an incr ease in the number of situations in which both prospective parents are homozygous for a mutation. The societal and medical pressures faced by these pe ople often bring them together into social groups where they are more likely to interact a nd develop close relationships. Si milar associations can develop among patients with autosomal dominant gene tic diseases that allow development to reproductive age (e.g., achondroplasia, osteogenesis imperfecta), again in creasing the likelihood of transmitting disease alleles. As our ability to treat children and adults with serious genetic diseases improves through both conventional and somatic genome editing therapies, there may be a growing need to address concerns potenti al parents might have about passing along these diseases to their children. Such situations may well increase interest am ong carriers and affected individuals in using genome ed iting techniques to avoid passing on deleterious genes to their children and subsequent generations. There can be an additional problem in the case of mutations that compromise fertility, which is the case for women who carry mutations such as Fragile X, BRCA-1 (de la Noval, 2016; Oktay et al., 2015) and others that cause the loss of oocytes during development or postnatally. Beyond inherited mutations, external factors like cancer treatments and environmental chemicals can also reduce ovarian reserve in women who wish to avoid transmission of a genetic disease.

As a result, affected women might require multiple superovulation cycles, with their attendant risks, discomforts, and costs, to identify an unaffected embryo. In all of these situations, if it were safe and efficient to use heritable genome editing (for example in gamete progenitors) to correct the mutation, this alternative might be preferred by prospective parents who otherwise would be considering PGD. The number of people in situations like those outlined above might be small, but the c oncerns of people facing these difficult choices are real. Treating Diseases That Affect Multiple Tissues Some genetically inherited diseas es affect specific cell types or tissues, such as particular types of blood cells. These diseases can be tr eated by somatic genome editing, and indeed, some of these treatments are alrea dy being used (see Chapter 4). However, somatic genome editing is less well suited to treating other genetic diseases that affect multiple tissues because it may be unable to target all aspects of the disease, or may have difficulty reachi ng a sufficient number of cells in the affected tissues to ameliorate sy mptoms. Examples of conditions for which somatic genome editing is already being investigated but may not be fully eff ective include cystic fibrosis, which affects multiple epithelial tissues ( tissues of the lungs, gut, and other organs), and muscular dystrophies, which can affect multiple mu scle types, including heart muscle, as well as other tissues such as brain. Coupl es with diseases who want to have genetically related children might be future candidates for germline genome editing because editing the defective gene in the germline could have therapeutic benefit in all tissues. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an in structive example of the challenges faced by the application of germline genome editing. DMD is an X-linked disease that affects about 1 in 3,600 male births. Symptoms begin to appear within the first few years after birth and progressively worsen. The average life expectan cy for a person with DMD is about 25 years. DMD is caused by mutations in one of the la rgest genes in the genome, dystrophin, which contains multiple repeating similar segments. Both the size of the dystrophin gene and its repeats predispose it to mutation, making this genetic disease relatively co mmon. Somatic genome editing approaches are already being developed to remove the deleterious alterations in the dystrophin gene in muscle precursors. Such somatic genome editing approaches will ameliorate the condition but are not expected to correct the symptoms in all tissues. Once those somatic editing approaches have been tested clinically, one might imagine trying to use germline editing to correct the defect in all tissues. Ho wever, women who know they are carriers for a DMD mutation could use PGD to avoi d having an affected child. Furthermore, one- third of DMD cases are due to de novo mutatio ns, which would not be recognized until after birth and thus are not amenable to germ line genome editing. Somatic editing approaches currently appear to be more useful than germlin e editing for this disease However, the pace of advances in genome editing methods and stem cell biology may alter that situation.

All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance HERITABLE GENOME EDITING 89 PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL ISSUES Practically speaking, considerable technical di fficulties remain to be overcome in applying genome editing to zygotes and early embryos. Alt hough the efficiency and accuracy of targeting can be extremely high, and there are sound reasons for believing that off-target effects can be greatly reduced (see Chapter 3 and Appendix A), ther e still would be a need to ensure that only embryos with correctly targeted alleles would be returned to the uterus to complete pregnancy. Mosaicism If genome editing were performed in a zygote (fertilized egg) or an early embryo, there would be a significant chance that some of the ce lls in the resulting early embryo would not have the desired (or even any) edits. This situation is called \"mosaicism\" and it presents a significant challenge to the application of germline genome editing on zygotes or embryos. Screening of an edited embryo by PGD to test for mosaicism would not ensure correct editing of the implanted embryo because a single cell may not reflect the genotype of the other cells of the embryo, and removal of multiple cells for te sting would destroy the embryo. The impact of mosaicism depends to some exte nt on the gene being targeted. Mosaicism is a serious problem if the gene of interest encode s a required cellular func tion, but if the gene encodes a secreted factor (e.g., growth hormone or erythropoietin), or leads to the secretion of a required molecule (such as a blood clotting factor), then correcting the gene in only a subset of cells may be sufficient. Furthermore, because th e germline in the resulting child may also be mosaic, editing only a subset of cells may not solve the problem for succeeding generations. But it may offer a better chance of finding a diseas e-free embryo after PGD, or allow culture and selection of edited spermatogonial stem cells (s ee section on potential alternative routes to heritable edits, below), thereby enabling those children to have una ffected offspring. Overall, at present, the issue of mosaicism w ould present a serious impediment to the clinical application of human germline genome editing in zygotes or early embryos, although recent progress suggests that this impediment may eventually beco me surmountable (Hashimoto et al., 2016). Potential Alternative Routes to Heritable Edits Editing the embryo genome is not the only pot ential way to achieve heritable genome modification. Approaches that di rectly modify the genomes of the gametes (eggs and sperm) or their precursors before fert ilization could overcome probl ems of mosaicism and would potentially allow preselection of appropriately targeted gametes be fore in vitro fertilization. There are a number of potentia l routes to gamete genome editi ng, some of which are already in use in mice and others of which remain to be fully developed. For example, spermatogonial stem cells (which will give rise to sperm) coul d be isolated by biopsy from testes, edited in culture, tested for correct gene editing, and then reimplanted into the testes. Alternatively, generating sperm or oocyte progenitors via plur ipotent induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells would allow genome editing to occur in the stem cell population. Correctly targeted clones could be identified and used to generate spermatids or perhaps sperm, either in vitro or in vivo, and used to fertilize donor eggs. Signi ficant progress on such technologi es is being made in mice and other mammals, including nonhuman primates (Herma nn et al., 2012; Hikabe et al., 2016; Shetty et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2016). A fu ture in which this kind of approach could be extended to ensure precise and effective corr ection of a disease-causing variant in gametes is not unrealistic Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 90 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION (see further discussion in Chapter 3 and Appe ndix A). The future prospects for heritable germline genome editing in humans will change dramatically if genome editing in progenitors of human eggs and sperm becomes a reality. Effect on the Human Gene Pool Another consideration is that some genes that cause serious genetic di seases, like sickle-cell anemia, have been subject to pos itive selection to maintain the disease-causing allele in the population because it produces some protection agai nst infectious disease when present in one copy (heterozygous). The same might be true for some other disease-causing variants and there is some evidence suggesting that might be the cas e for cystic fibrosis, although that is not yet established (Poolman and Galvani, 2007). Such examples have led some to question whether heritable germline editing to remove disease-causing variant genes might significantly alter the human gene pool. As discussed earlier, the numbe rs of cases of human germline editing to treat disease, if it were to be approved, would be very small and there is little chance of any significant effects on the gene pool in the foreseea ble future. It has also been proposed that any heritable germline editing should be restricted to making changes that occur naturally in the human population (i.e., converting deleterious disease-causing va riant (mutant) alleles to a common non-pathogenic DNA sequence), to mini mize risk of unexpected effects of the modification in generations to come (see also Chapter 6 for discussion of gene editing for enhancement purposes). Changing a diseas e-causing mutation to a known existing non- pathogenic sequence would be the case in any cu rrently envisioned therap eutic applications and thus the effect of any such germline genome editi ng changes for therapeutic purposes is expected to have minimal effect on the human gene pool. Ability to Select Appropriate Gene Targets Finally, the issue arises of wh ether current knowledge of human genes, genomes, and genetic variation and the interactions be tween genes and the environment is sufficient to enable germline genome editing to be performed safely. While our knowledge is arguably sufficient for some genes, in many cases it currently is not. There is uncertainty, for exampl e, about why the APOE4 allele, which clearly correlates with increased risk of Alzheime r's disease, is present in the human gene pool at such a high freq uency. One theory is that it ma y confer an advantage in other respects, similar to the heteroz ygous advantage of sick le-cell mutations that confer protection against malaria. A gene such as APOE4 woul d not be a good candidate for germline genome editing because it may confer so me protection against liver da mage by hepatitis C infection (Kuhlman et al., 2010; Wozniak et al ., 2002) and also the fact that its deleterious effects are not fully penetrant. Knowledge of genome-environm ent interactions will improve over time as large-scale projects linking genomic sequences with details of health, envi ronment, and lifestyle are carried out such as the 100,000 Genomes Project in the United Kingdom and the Precision Medicine Initiative in the United States. As understanding of the genome progresses and genome editing/stem cell technologies im prove, future possibilities for ed iting the heritable germline to improve human health and well-being will n eed to be the subject of ongoing, careful consideration. Each potential target gene would need to be evalua ted carefully on both scientific and ethical grounds, and only well -understood genes would be suitable candidates for germline genome editing.

He began his article with a call \"to assess objectiv ely the prospects for m odifying the pattern of genes of a human being by various means,\" and con tinued with a caution: th at one must keep in mind that \"the most interesting human traits\u2014rel ating to intelligence, te mperament, and physical structure\u2014are highly polygenic\" and therefore depend upon large num bers of genes interacting in complex ways with the environment. This is still true, but more is being learned every year about the genetic regulatory circui ts that control complex traits, and there is an ongoing need to consider the potential benefits and risks of germline genome editing. Balancing Individual-Level Benefi ts and Societal-Level Risks One of the challenging characteristics of deba tes concerning heritable germline editing is that they require a balancing possibl e benefits that accrue primarily to individuals (such as prospective parents and children) against not only risk s to the individuals, but also against possible harms that are discussed at a social and cultural level. This is a complicated ethical analysis, in no small part because the individua l benefits and risks are more immediate and concrete, whereas concerns about cultural eff ects are necessarily more diffuse. In addition, although examination of past t echnological innovations can help make predictions about the cultural changes, these remain necessarily specu lative, because any cultural changes resulting from a new technology take time to develop. Thus, the ethical debates become difficult because the arguments can fail to engage each other directly. In the United States, appropriate considerati on of social and cultural concerns is usually resolved within the context of civil rights juri sprudence and legal decisions, which compare the burden on individual liberties or the discriminatory impact of those burdens to whether there is a rational or compelling need for thes e particular state restrictions. In these challenges, the outcomes are often de termined less by the substantive arguments for and against the technology or an individual's ch oice, and more by the level of justification required to uphold the restrictions . When ordinary liberties are re stricted, a mere rational basis for governmental restrictions will be upheld by the courts. If the liberties are fundamental, such as those specifically identified in the Bill of Rights or otherwise deemed fundamental by the courts, then a much more compelling and well-cr afted justification for restricting fundamental liberties. The contours of the latter category can be uncertain, however, because of enduring debates surrounding the methodology and legitimacy of judicial dete rminations that some rights are fundamental despite their absence from the B ill of Rights. Procreative rights fall within this disputed area, making it harder to predict which level of justificati on will be needed in case of challenge to government restriction on one or mo re aspects of procreativ e activities (Murray and Luker, 2015). Parental Benefits The possible benefits of heritable germlin e genome editing accrue most immediately to individuals: the prospective pare nts who want to have an unaff ected genetically related child Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The desire for genetic relation is evidenced by the fact that many prospective parents, faced with the choice between foregoing genetically related children or risking the birth of a child with a genetic i llness, will choose to risk having an affected child (Decruyenaere et al., 2007; Dudding et al., 2000; Kr ukenberg et al., 2013). If an edit is made in a gene that is well-underst ood, and the change is a conversion to a known, common, non-pathological sequence, then germline genome editing might offer an option that is at times more effective or acceptable than PGD. It would offer benefits to the parents and allow for the birth of a child who will enjoy better healt h. In the case of some disorders that are lethal at a young age, it allows for the birth of a child with the prospect of a more ordinary lifespan. Access to germline genome editing would be consis tent with the broadest legal and cultural interpretations of parental aut onomy rights in the United States. Th e desire to have genetically related children may arise from a variety of factors, ranging from a wish to see one's self or one's ancestors reflected in the appearance of the children to a belief in the need for a biological linkage in order to satisfy a sense of lineage, cont inuity or even some form of immortality (Rulli, 2014). Precluding access to this technology could be regarded as limiting parental autonomy, depending upon the country and the culture. Indeed, some people feel they have a religious or historical mandate to have genetically related children . There are others who do not share this view of parental aut onomy, and see germline editing as a step toward seeing children as constructed products, and an incr easing intolerance of their inevitable imperfections and failures to live up to parental expecta tions (Sandel, 2004). And some w ould argue that satisfying the desire for genetically related child ren is not an unalloyed benefit, as it can be seen as reifying what some view as outdated notions of kinshi p and family, precisely at a time when adoption, same-sex marriage, donor gametes, surrogacy a nd step-parenting are being normalized (Franklin, 2013). In the United States, procreative liberty is ground ed in legal cases that relate to the right to have children at the time one wishes, and with considerable latitude in rearing practices. 53 Relevant cases focus on a right to rear children an d shape their characters largely to fit parental preferences; to not have the stat e involuntarily sterilize persons; on the right to use contraception to avoid conceiving; on the right to control one's body even if it en tails terminating a pre-viable pregnancy; and on the right to preserve one's h ealth even if it entails terminating a viable pregnancy. In a related case concerning statutory interpreta tion of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the U.S. Supreme Court acknow ledged that procreation is a major life activity.54 The broad view of these cases would include me thods of achieving pregnancy and a right to use the same technologies to redu ce the risk of disease and di sability in those children. However, the constitutional law cases in the Un ited States do not direct ly address a right to destroy an ex utero embryo, nor do they address PGD or the legality of IVF. The expansive view above remains untested with respect to how broa dly it construes procreat ive liberty, and related cases on parental rights and re production do not clea rly support this in terpretation (Nelson, 2013). Procreative liberty\u2014 like all liberties\u2014 can be viewed either as a negative right that protects parties from governmental prohibitions or as a positive right th at obligates government 53Meyer v. Nebraska , 262 U.S. 390 (1923); Pierce v Society of Sisters , 268 U.S. 510 (1925); Farrington v. Tokushige , 273 U.S. 284 (1927); Prince v. Massachusetts , 321 U.S. 158 (1944); Wisconsin v.

In the United States a negative right analysis of procreation protects parents from government prohibitions on ke y aspects of reproductive choice (such as use of contraceptives) a nd parental discretion (such as c hoice of language of educational instruction). But reasonable regu lation of a technology for the protection of the health and wellbeing of those affected is entirely permissibl e, even where claims of constitutional rights can be made. And this has never been extended to a positive right to demand that government fund or even approve new repr oductive technologies. Potential Risks Balanced against the possible benefits of ge rmline genome editing are a variety of potential risks. As discussed earlier in the chapter, in its current state genome ed iting technology still faces technical challenges that would need to be ove rcome before it can be applied to human germline genome editing and these require caution and caref ul review of any proposals to proceed to clinical trials. Unintended Consequences One concern is that human intervention may ha ve unintended consequences. In the case of germline genome editing, this concern has two distin ct components. The first is the possibility of off-target effects of the editi ng process, as in the case of somatic genome editing. As discussed elsewhere in this report (in deta il in Appendix A but also in ot her chapters), this technical question is receiving a lot of scientific at tention. Although improvements in genome editing technology are reducing the incidenc e of off-target even ts and methods are being developed for assessing their rate, with some approaches alread y approved for somatic therapies, they have not yet reached the point where clini cal trials in germline gene edi ting could be authorized. Before any clinical trials using germline genome editin g could be approved it would be necessary to demonstrate that the editing procedures would not lead to any significant increase in unintended variants. The required level of such variants w ould necessarily be lower than for somatic genome editing but, given that germline genome editing will not occur for some time, the technology for minimizing and assessing off-target events will undoubtedly have improved significantly. In addition, experience with somatic genome editing will have refined understanding of what might be considered acceptable or unaccepta ble rates of unintended variants. Whatever standards are developed for somatic applications, there will be less tolerance for off-target effects in germline applications. By definition those affected by the edits (future offspring) did not make the decision to be subj ects of research or attempts at therapy, and adverse effects might be multiplied by reverberat ion across generations. Both factors lead to a more conservative approach to the risk-benefit balance. A second concern is that the intended genom e edits themselves might have unintended consequences, even in the absence of off-target effects. In the case of germline genome editing to convert a well understood disease-causing varian t gene to a widely oc curring non-pathological variant, the editing change w ould be to a version of the ge ne that is known not to have deleterious consequences. These are broadly pres ent in the population al ready, so the chances that the edit will have some unexpected effects are small. On the other hand, the question of unintended consequences of a target ed edit does arise in the context of edits to make a change to a DNA sequence that is not already prevalent in th e population, as would be the case of some so-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Long-Term Follow-Up As with any new procedure, carefully monitored clinical trial protocols would be required for germline genome editing, with attention to monitori ng off-target events as well as the efficiency and correctness of the specific edit. Unlike conven tional clinical trials, germline genome editing trials would likely require long-term pros pective follow-up studies across subsequent generations. This follow-up would entail study of the future children affected by the intervention, none of whom would have been party to the initial decision to participate in a research trial. Data of this type would be important for determini ng whether the techniques had achieved their goals (Friedmann et al., 2015). Even those who have vol unteered to be research subjects cannot be compelled to participate in long-term follow-up. Nonetheless, encouragement is permitted. Experience from xenotransplantation, and so me drug and device trials, shows that this encouragement can be successful. And despite th e particular challenge of studying offspring rather than those who consented to the research, expe rience with other reproductive technologies suggests that follow-up can be carried out in numbers sufficient to permit conclusions about many possible long-term effects (Lu et al., 2013). Societal Effects Some have argued that germline editing can be justified on grounds that go beyond mere parental choice. There is a line of thought that germline modificat ion could be used to create a level playing field for those whose traits now put their children and descendants at a disadvantage (Buchanan et al., 2001). Others s ee a public health benef it in access to germline genome editing because it might somewhat reduce the prevalence of many devastating diseases, such as Tay-Sachs and Huntington's disease. That said, it is importa nt to note that the history of abusive and coercive eugenics (d iscussed in section on human dign ity and the fear of eugenics, below) is intertwined with previous, undoubtedly well-intenti oned public health and hygiene movements, which is one reason w hy discussions of public health benefits often engender some skepticism and unease. Some contemporary transhumanists point out that the human body is flawed in that it easily becomes diseased, requires a great deal of sleep, has various cognitive limitations, and eventually dies. They suggest that it would make sense to improve the human species by making it more resistant to disease, more moral, and more in telligent (Hughes, 2004). So me, such as philosopher John Harris, say that in certain cases there is a moral obligation to enhance ourselves genetically (Harris, 2007). But these are arguments about en hancement, not the restoration or maintenance of ordinary health. That topic is addressed in more detail in Chapter 6. A \"Natural\" Human Genome and the Appropr iate Degree of Human Intervention Among the social and cultural arguments agains t germline genome editing are positions that support a preference for a \"natural\" genome. Although there is wide acceptance of human intervention in agriculture and medicine, some hol d the view that the human genome is different and should be free of intentional manipulation becaus e of some aspect of its naturalness, whether defined as \"normal,\" \"real,\" or otherwise de termined largely by for ces other than human intervention (Nuffield Council, 2015) and some aspect of its \"humanness\" (Machalek, 2009; Pollard, 2016). However, the human genome is not entirely \"human,\" as it includes Neanderthal Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Nor does it exist in any single, static state. As reviewed in Chapter 4, each time a cell divides, numerous changes in the DNA sequence occur, and environmental insults su ch as radiation and ch emicals (both natural and synthetic) also produce sequence changes. Moreover, meiosis combin ed with fertilization creates in each individua l a novel assortment of gene variants. The result is signi ficant variation in genomic DNA sequence among individuals (Kas owski et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2010) and even within the cells of a single individual. Ev ery human (other than m onozygotic twins) begins with a unique genome\u2014actually two genomes that s ubsequently diversify as cells divide, each of which is \"natural. There is no single human genome shared by all of humanity. The concern then devolves to the view that th e human genome should be treated with a sense of humility and that humanity should recognize the limits of wisdom and science, and even that human intervention is more dangerous or more unpredictable than natural processes. This concern often is expressed by th e term \"playing God,\" which cap tures the notion that humans lack a god-like omniscience that would be requir ed to make any changes in the genome safely (and to predict that such changes would actua lly serve the intended purpose). Even those approaching the issue from a nontheological point of view may use the term to represent a more general notion about appropr iate limits of intentional human c ontrol of the environment or of the human genome (President's Commission, 1983). To some extent, this argument implicitly accepts the thesis that the forces of nature and evolution are a better\u2014or at least less problem atic\u2014source of genome alteration than human intervention. However, the natural variations in human genomes arise by chance and are selected for or against during evolution by founder effects and according to selection pressures such as climate, nutrition, and infectious disease, some of which may no longer be relevant in the modern world. Accordingly, while it is important to recognize the limits of human understanding and proceed with all due care, this does not ne cessarily mean that soci ety should forswear any human intervention at all. Overall, from a scientific viewpoint, some c onclusions about likely benefits and risks of germline genome editing can be supported with a fair degree of certainty, while others remain uncertain and in need of further investigati on and societal debate, calling for humility with respect to those conclusions. A ssessing the probabilities of efficac y and risk is the focus of clinical trials, which can be viewed as a manife station of the recognition of the limits of human knowledge. Beyond the scientific assessment of risks and uncertainties, the question of the proper extent of human intervention in nature has long been disc ussed in spiritual and re ligious terms. In the contemporary West, where Christian traditions have had the most influence on what is today a more religiously diverse and ofte n secular culture, these ideas are expressed in the debate about which tasks in improving or stewarding nature are the domain or obligation of humans and which are to be left to God (C ole-Turner, 1993; Vatican, 2015). This thinking reflects beliefs that are present across a variety of tr aditions and many centuries, incl uding St. Francis' Canticle of Creation and the belief systems am ong some Native American nations. In the Jewish tradition, on the ot her hand, there is an explicit obligation to build and develop the world in any way that is beneficial to people, and such improvements are viewed as a positive collaboration between God and humans, not as an interference with creation (Steinberg, 2006). Similarly, many Muslims and Buddhists view genetic engineering as just one of many welcome interventions to reduce suffering from disease (HDC, 2016; Inhorn, 2012; Pfleiderer et al., 2010). The question will always be how much hu man-directed intervention in nature and in Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 96 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION humans themselves is appropriate or even permi ssible. This is a spiritu al and practical question asked by both religious and nonreligious people, although somewhat more often by the former (Akin et al., 2017). Even among the religious, adhe rents of different faiths will have varying degrees of interest or concern (Evans, 2010). Human Dignity and the Fear of Eugenics International covenants, treaties, and nati onal constitutions, including European treaties focused on banning germline modification, typically invoke the concept of dignity (Hennette- Vauchez, 2011). While this term has many meanings , it is most often invoked in the debate about germline genome editing to affirm that humans ha ve value simply by virtue of being human and not because of their capacities, and thus cannot be treated as instru ments of another's will (Andorno, 2005; Sulmasy, 2008). Emmanuel Kant viewed human agency and free will as essential aspects of human dignity. The term al so can signal a special regard for humans as opposed to other species, an appreciation of the intellectual capacities of humans, and a commitment to promoting autonomy and human flourishing. Since rights and other individualistic arguments cannot ea sily be used to address concer ns about future generations or humanity, \"dignity\" has been invoked to \"provide an ultimate theoretical reason to prevent a misuse of emerging biotechnological powers\" (Andorno, 2005). Even if limited to preventing serious disease or disability, th e prospect of using heritable germline genome editing triggers concern that purely voluntary, individual decisions can collec tively change social norms regarding the acceptance of less serious disabilities (Sandel, 2004). The disability rights community is not m onolithic, and its attitudes toward genetic technologies such as prenatal screening can vary from supportive to skeptical (Chen and Schiffman, 2000; Saxton, 2000). There has been a long and ongoing debate between different parts of the disability community with regard to use of screening techno logies. These tensions are real, continuing, and unlikely to be resolved entirely. Still, disability activists have been among the most visible critics of using technol ogy to screen for or determine the genetic qualities of children. Jackie Leach Scully writes of a fear that voluntary prenatal diagnostic techniques, which would also apply to genome editing, set us on a \"slippery slope\" (a concept discussed further below) toward intolerance of di sability and even the risk of a return to the coercive practices of the past (Scully, 2009). Others write that a policy of prevention by genetic screening (and by extension genome editing) \"appears to reflect the judgment that lives with disabilities are so burdensome to the disabled child, her family, and society that thei r avoidance is a health care priority\u2014a judgment that exaggerates and misattributes many or most of the difficulties associated with disability\" (Wasserman and Asch, 2006). The same observa tion has been made concerning the differing perceptions of disabled persons and medical professionals about the degree of distress caused by a particular condition (Longmore , 1995). Studies suggest that \"m any members of the health professions view childhood disability as predomin antly negative for children and their families, in contrast to what research on the life satisf action of people with disabilities and their families has actually shown.\" (Parens and Asch, 2000, p. 20) Indeed, there is concern that the availability of the technology might actually lead to a judgment that parents who forego germline genome editing are negligent, a theory seriously discussed (although ultimately ab andoned) with respect to gene tic screening when it became a common practice (Malek and Daar, 2012; Sa yres and Magnus, 2012; Wasserman and Asch, have cited fears that hard-won successes at developi ng laws and policies that make Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance HERITABLE GENOME EDITING 97 PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION the world accessible to those with disabilities will lose support when the number of persons directly affected declines. One can argue that these concerns reflect a fa lse dichotomy, and that unconditional love for a disabled child once born and respect for all people who are born with or who develop disabilities are not incompatible with interven ing to avert disease and disabil ity prior to birth or conception. And the decades that saw the explosion of pren atal diagnosis (accompanied by selective abortion of affected fetuses) and preimplantation dia gnostics (accompanied by se lective implantation of nonaffected embryos) are the same as those in wh ich public attitudes towa rd disability became far more accepting (Hernandez et al., 2004; Makas, 1988; Steinbach et al., 2016). It would seem that \"encouraging attempts to reduce the incide nce of a genetic diseas e is compatible with continuing respect for those born with the dis ease and providing support for their distinctive needs\" (Kitcher, 1997, p. 85). The disability community is characterized by a long and ongoing tension with regard to use of screening technologies. The liter ature appears to support openly acknowledging that this tension is real, continuing, and unlikely to be resolved entirely, and that any step toward the use of genome editing to eliminate disabilities must be carried out with care and open discussion, and the committee supports this call for continued public deliberation (Kitcher, 1997) (see Chapter 7). Public policy has shifted toward eliminati ng discrimination in em ployment or public services, and public investment in changing the social, physical, and employment environment to achieve this goal has increased, with measur es ranging from accessible buildings to sign language presentations to aural signals for str eet crossings. The range of measures remains insufficient, however, and one cannot know whether this shift in attitude would have been even more dramatic if genetic screening and abor tion laws had not made it easier to reduce the prevalence of birth defects. Nonetheless, this progress does to some extent address the concern that reducing the prevalence of disabilities will necessa rily decrease empa thy, acceptance, or integration of those who have them. Economic and Social Justice Recognizing that germline genome-editing technol ogy is unlikely to be used widely in the near future and that drastic tr ansformation of the species or imme diate changes in cultural norms are unlikely, some social justice arguments focus on the effects of the technology's being accessible only to a few rather than to too many. In this framing, the technology is another example of a society's allocating considerable resources to devel op a technology that will benefit only a relatively few wealthy people when this m oney could be used to relieve the suffering of millions of poor people through already ex isting technologies (Cahill, 2008). One counterargument is that the res earch phase may include those less well-off, or that even if treatments for rare but compelling diseases often start with the wealthy, th ey eventually become more affordable and available for the poor. Mo reover, the research that will make germline genome editing possible will likely provide insights th at will lead to health care interventions for other disorders as well. More to the point, perh aps, is the reality that\u2014at least in the United States\u2014health care budgets are not set globally, and therefore th e decision to refrain from spending in one area will not nece ssarily result in the f unds being redirected to another area of need. Another concern is that if heritable genome editing were to become prevalent among those who are wealthier or better insured, it could chan ge the prevalence of avoidable diseases between advantaged and disadvantaged populations and c ould permanently establish what Harris (2007) Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 98 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION calls \"parallel populations.\" While great inequality already exis ts, the argument continues, germline genome editing would make a culturally determined inequality into one that is biological. While such a phenomenon already exists in the form of durable effects of better nutrition and use of vaccines among the advantaged populations of the world, some critics are concerned about adding yet anothe r, more durable form of supe rior access to better health (Center for Genetics and Society, 2 015). These concerns apply to a range of health advances, and are not limited to genome editing. The Slippery Slope Many scholars who support (or at least are not opposed to) ge rmline modifications align the possible uses of genome editing along a con tinuum of acceptability. This continuum almost always starts with converting single-gene diso rders to a common, nondeleterious sequence at the most-acceptable end, and moves toward enhancements that are unrelated to disease on the least- acceptable end. The slippery slope claim is that taki ng the first step with single-gene disorders is likely to lead, in some number of years, to the conduct of nondisease enhancements that many would rather see prohibited. As one group invol ved with somatic modification wrote in the journal Nature , \"many oppose germline modification on the grounds that permitting even unambiguously therapeutic interventions could start us down a path towards non-therapeutic genetic enhancement\" (Lanphier et al., 2015). The slippery slope arguments of most critics do not claim inevitability but are instead probabilistic. They are based on what could be described as predic tive sociology about how societies actually function and re jection of the notion that plac ing barriers and speed bumps on the slippery slope will be a sufficient deterrent to less de sirable uses (Volokh, 2003). Many scientific advances in the past \u2014ranging from reconstructive surg ery (which has led to plastic surgery for aesthetics) to prenatal screening for lethal disorders (which has led to screening of carriers for disease genes and preimplantati on screening for nonlethal, even late-onset disorders)\u2014have raised similar concerns about a slippery slope toward less compelling or even antisocial uses. An opponent of editing the germline would not necessarily oppose on principle replacing a disease gene variant with a corresponding, common, non-disease ge ne, as such a change would give offspring no social advantag e and is the type of instrument al action directed at future children that is currently part of modern medicine. Many opponents, however, do not believe genome editing would stop there and observe that a number of social processes make the slope more slippery. Parts of the medi cal profession might become invest ed in providing the service, or patient groups in seeking the se rvice, creating powerf ul interest groups favoring its maintenance or even expansion. IVF, for example, was origin ally developed to circumvent fallopian tube blockage. It soon was extended, however, to circumventing natu rally age-related decline in fertility and even postmenopausal infertility, a nd later became an enabling technology for PGD. Likewise, PGD was originally designed to sel ect against embryos with serious deleterious mutations but later was expanded to conditions that not all agree ar e diseases or disabilities, as well as to sex selection. On the other hand, slippery slope arguments have their critics, who point to their inherent uncertainty and the fact that many such claims do not come to pass. Indeed, despite predictions to the contrary, neither IVF nor PGD has come to be used for convenience or for selection of trivial traits. Even artificial insemination, whic h offers an inexpensive way to \"optimize\" the male genetic contribution, has not become a widesp read practice except when the male partner is Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Furthermore, among those women who already needed to use donor ga metes, almost none took advantage of the opportunity to obtain semen from the so-calle d \"Nobel sperm bank\" (P lotz, 2006), although there has been evidence of a stronger tendency to \"optimize\" when it comes to egg donation (Klitzman, 2016). Those who reject slippery sl ope arguments often are less concerned than proponents about situations which might be viewed as the bottom of the slope. Many of the attempts to introduce speed bumps or friction on the slippery slope in the evolution of genetic modification of hu mans have focused on the easily grasped linguistic/cognitive difference between a body /individual and offspring/society, thereby establishing the distinction betw een editing of somatic and germline cells. Critics would claim that the current debate about cros sing the cognitive barrier (i.e., cr ossing the germline) is proof of the existence of a slippery slope. Overall, slippery slope arguments do not depe nd on universal condemnation of the initial, most compelling applications of heritable genome editing. But wh ile many think that regulation could establish effective speed bumps, proponents of slippery slope arguments raise the question of whether and how society can develop regulation s that are sufficiently robust to quell the fear of a progressive move toward less compelling and more controversial app lications. Indeed, they would say that regulations would do little to stop the progression down a slippery slope because regulations are based on cultural views, and it is the underlying cha nge in cultural views that is precisely the slippery slope. REGULATION Regulation in the United States In the United States, heritable genome editi ng would be subject to a complex landscape of state and federal laws and regulations (see Chapter 2). The legality of res earch, and perhaps even clinical application, would vary from state to state as a result of differing laws on fetal and embryo research. Federal funding fo r the research would likely be unavailable because of current legislative restrictions on funding research involving human embryos. Should heritable germline genome editing move into clinical investigations, the U.S. F ood and Drug Administration (FDA) would have regulatory jurisdic tion. The altered cells\u2014whether gametes or the embryo\u2014would need to be implanted for gesta tion, and this transfer would trigger the same FDA jurisdiction as that used by the agency in 2001 (FDA, 2009) when it determined that reproductive cloning could not proceed without auth orization. This jurisdiction derives from the agency's power to regulate tissue transplantation. While IVF and even PGD were developed before the FDA policy in this area was fully developed and therefore have not been regulated as clos ely as more recent products, genome editing would fall s quarely within FDA jurisdiction. A careful stepwise process (outlined in more de tail in Chapter 2) woul d include consideration by the National Institutes of Health's (NIH 's) Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) (with public comment and transparent review), lo cal institutional review board (IRB) and local institutional biosafety committ ee (IBC) review, and FDA review before any decision about whether to permit clinical trials could be made. If germline genome editing succeeded in research trials and was approved for marketing, th ere would also be mechanisms for oversight in the postapproval context.

Some of these regulati ons focus on donor material safety, transparency and reporting requirements, as is the case with IVF, or on quality control of the laboratories (though not necessarily the actual diagnostics) used for PGD. He ritable germline editing would be performed in conjunction with IVF and PGD, t hus could involve statutes and regulations that apply to those technologies. For example, IVF itself is subject to rules that require registration of facilities, screening of donor gametes for co mmunicable diseases, and compliance with good tissue-handling standards (FDA, 2001). Programs us ing IVF also must report pregnancy success rates to the Centers for Diseas e Control and Prevention (CDC).55 Following the publication of the National Acad emies report on mitochondrial replacement techniques, which can result in heritable changes in small amounts of mitochondrial (i.e., non- nuclear) DNA present in the egg, and the publicati on of genome editing research in China using non-viable human embryos, NIH made a statement to the effect that it would not fund research involving genome editing of human embryos.56 Francis Collins, Director of NIH, stated that NIH \"will not fund any use of gene-editing technologies in human embryos.\" He noted that the \"concept of altering the human ge rmline in embryos for clinical purposes has been debated over many years from many different perspectives, and ha s been viewed almost universally as a line that should not be crossed\" (NIH, 2015b). But th is already something NI H could not fund, due to legal obstacles created by the Dickey-Wicke r Amendment (forbidding HHS funding of such work) and the RAC policy (declining to review such work, as per requirement for NIH-funded projects) (see Chapter 2). The NIH statement also highlighted the requi rement for FDA approval of IND application for anything involving clinical tr ials for transfer a nd gestation of an edited embryo. The FDA had never received or approved a proposal to modify the germline, but apparently alarmed by the direction of research, the U.S. Congress held h earings in June 2015 on \"T he Science and Ethics of Engineered Human DNA.\" 57 This was followed by the omnibus spending bill provision, noted in Chapter 2, which prevents the FDA from usin g any of its resources to even consider an application to proceed with clinical trials.58 This limitation will last at least through the end of April 2017. Beyond that date, the prohibition ma y be extended or deleted, depending upon the details of the next budget exerci se. If the prohibition is lift ed, the FDA will once again be permitted to entertain requests to being clinical trials in this area, t hough the restrictions on use of federal funds will remain. 55Assisted Reproductive Technology Programs , 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 263a-1 (current through Public Law at (accesse d January 30, 2017). 57\"The Science and Ethics of Engineered Human DNA. \" Hearing before the Subc ommittee on Research and Technology, of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, June 16, 2015. https://science.house.gov/legislation/hearings/subcommitte e-research-and-technology-hearing-science-and-ethics- genetically (accessed January 30, 2017). 58Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, HR 2029, 114 Cong., 1st sess.

Salient instruments that have legal effect include the European Oviedo convention, which allows genetic engineering only for prev entive, diagnostic, or therapeutic purposes and only where it is not aimed at changing the ge netic makeup of a person' s descendants, thus precluding germline genome editing. Although si gned by 35 nations, it is binding only on those 29 that ratified it (6 nations di d not ratify it in full), and ev en then requires implementation through domestic legislation (COE, 2016). More recently, as discussed in Chapter 1, the organizers of the D ecember 2015 International Summit convened by the science and medicine ac ademies of the United States, the United Kingdom, and China called for a pause of some undefined duration in any attempt at heritable germline editing. Their statement read: It would be irresponsible to proceed w ith any clinical use of germline editing unless and until (i) the relevant safety and efficacy issues have been resolved, based on appropriate understanding and balancing of risks, potential benefits, and alternatives, and (ii) there is broad societal consen sus about the appr opriateness of the proposed application. Moreover, any clinical use should proceed only under appropriate regulatory oversight. At present, these criteria have not been met for any proposed clinical use: the safety issues have not yet been adeq uately explored; the cases of most compelling benefit are limited; and many nations have legislative or regulatory bans on germline modificati on. However, as scientific knowledge advances and societal views evolve, the clinical use of germ line editing should be revisited on a regular basis\" (NASEM, 2016d). Similarly, the International Society for St em Cell Research, when releasing its 2016 professional guidelines for regenerative medicine research, included the following: \"Until further clarity emerges on both scientific and ethical fronts, the ISSCR holds that any attempt to modify the nuclear genome of human embryos for the pu rpose of human reproduction is premature and should be prohibited at this time\" (ISSCR, 2015). In 2015, a self-organized group of multinational experts calle d the Hinxton group published a statement exploring the possibili ty that heritable germline genome editing might be acceptable, albeit with many caveats (Hinxt on Group, 2015). According to that statement \"[p]rior to any movement toward human reproductive applications, a number of crucial scie ntific challenges and questions must be addressed.\" The statement pr oceeds to list a number of technical questions related to safety and efficacy and stresses the ne ed to explore cultural attitudes and whether and how legal limits might be placed on particular uses. The French National Academy also appears to have taken the position that while heritable germline genome editing is unacceptable now, one can contemplate a time when it might be permitted, stating that \"this research, includi ng that on germline cells and human embryos, should be carried out provided that it is scie ntifically and medically justified\" (ANM, 2016). These statements all recognize that issues of sa fety and efficacy associated with heritable germline genome editing are far from resolved and that attempts to apply this form of genome Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

They a ll note, however, that the science is continuing to progress rapidly, and they avoid calling for pe rmanent prohibitions. I ndeed, the Hinxton group recommends that \"a detailed but flexible road map [be] produced to guide the development of standards for safety and efficacy\" (Hinxton Group, 2015). CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION In some situations heritable germline editi ng would provide the only or the most acceptable option for parents who desire to have genetically related children while minimizing the risk of serious disease or disability in a prospective chil d. Yet while relief from inherited diseases could accrue from its use, there is significant public discomfort about germline genome editing, particularly for less serious conditions and for si tuations in which alte rnatives exist. These concerns range from a view that it is inappr opriate for humans to intervene in their own evolution to anxiety about uninte nded consequences for the indivi duals affected and for society as a whole. More research is needed be fore any germline intervention could meet the risk/benefit standard for authorizing clinical trials. But as the technical hurdles facing genome editing of progenitors of eggs and sperm are overcome, editing to prevent transm ission of genetically inherited diseases may become a realistic possibility. The primary U.S. entity with authority for the regulation of germline genome editing\u2014the FDA\u2014does incorporate value judgm ents about risks and benefits in its decision making. A robust public discussion about the values to be placed on the benefits and risks of heritable germline editing is needed now so that these valu es can be incorporated as appropriate into the risk/benefit assessments that will precede any decision about whether to authorize clinical trials. But the FDA does not have a statutory mandate to consider public views about the intrinsic morality of a technology when deciding whether to authorize clinical trials. That level of discussion takes place at the RAC, in legislat ures and at other venue s for public engagement, discussed in Chapter 7. Heritable germline genome editing trials must be approached with caution, but caution does not mean they must be prohibited. If the technical challenges are overcome and pot ential benefits are reasonable in light of the risks, clinical trials could be initiated, if limited to only the most compelling circumstances, subject to a comprehensive oversight framework that would protect the research subjects and their descendants; and have suffi cient safeguards to protect agai nst inappropriate expansion to uses that are less compelling or less well understood. RECOMMENDATION 5-1. Clinical trials using heritable germline genome editing should be permitted only wi thin a robust and effective regulatory framework that encompasses the absence of reasonable alternatives; restriction to preventing a serious disease or condition; restriction to editing genes that have been convincingly demonstrated to cause or to strongly predispose to that disease or condition; restriction to converting such genes to versions that are prevalent in the population and are known to be associated with ordinary health with little or no evidence of ad verse effects; Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Given how long modifying the germline has be en at the center of debates about moral boundaries, as well as the pluralism of values in society, it would be surprising if everyone were to agree with this recommendation. Even for thos e who do agree, it would be surprising if they all shared identical reasoning fo r doing so. For some, it is about respecting parental desires for genetically related children. For others, it is pr imarily about allowing children to be born as healthy as possible. But as noted earlier in this chapter, some do not view heritable germline genome editing as a benefit to the resulting ch ild, who otherwise might never have been conceived at all. And for others, the desire of parents who carry genetic disease to have a genetically related child through this technology, instead of having a genetically unrelated child, is not sufficient to outweigh the social concerns that have been raised. There are also those who think the final criterion of Recommendation 5-1 cannot be met, and that once germline modification had begun, the regulatory mechanisms instituted could not limit the technology to the uses identified in the recommen dation. If it is indeed not possible to satisfy the criteria in the recommendation, the committee's view is th at germline genome editing would not be permissible. The committee calls for continued public engagement and input (see Chapter 7) while the basic science evolves a nd regulatory safeguards are develope d to satisfy the criteria set forth here. Heritable germline genome editing raises concer ns about premature or unproven uses of the technology, and it is possible that the criteria outlined here for responsible oversight would be achievable in some but not all jurisdictions. This possibility raises the concern that \"regulatory havens\" could emerge that would tempt providers or consumers to travel to jurisdictions with more lenient or nonexistent regulations to undergo the restricted procedures (Charo, 2016a). The result could be a \"race to the bottom\" that w ould encourage laxer standa rds in nations seeking revenues from medical tourism, as has happene d with both stem cell therapy and mitochondrial replacement techniques (Abbott et al., 2010; Ch aro, 2016a; Turner and Kn oepfler, 2016; Zhang et al., 2016). The phenomenon of me dical tourism, which encompasse s the search for faster and cheaper therapeutic options, as well as newer or less regulated interventions, will be impossible to control completely if the t echnical capabilities exist in more permissive jurisdictions (Cohen, 2015; Lyon, 2017). Thus, it is important to highli ght the need for comprehensive regulation. As of late 2015, the United States is unable to consider whether to begin germline genome editing trials, regardless of whether the criteria laid out a bove could be met.

Indeed, bone marrow transplantation, in which cells of differing gene tic composition are introduced into patients, has been used for decades, and the use of gene th erapy to treat children with severe combined immune deficiency, the so-called \"bubble boy dis ease\" is now a part of medical treatment (De Ravin et al., 2016). Beyond issues of safety, efficacy, and informed consent, there has been no concern about the legitimacy of somatic cell and gene therapies among those who generally endorse modern medicine. Genome editing is play ing an increasing part in somatic gene therapy to treat and prevent disease (see Chapter 4). Recent advances, however, have increased the po ssibility that genome editing could also be used for purposes that go beyond the kinds of gene therapy and other medical interventions discussed above, and therefore ha ve raised anew the question of whether enhancement should be regulated or prohibited, and whet her there are important differe nces depending upon whether the enhancements are somatic or heritable. This chapter explores the possible applica tions of genome editing to achieve what is commonly described as \"enhancement,\" a term that itself is problematic; it implies a change from\u2014indeed an improvement upon\u2014an existing condition. Enhancements may range from the mundane, such as cosmetic changes in hair color; to the more physically interventionist, such as elective cosmetic surgery; to the more dangero us and problematic, such as the use of some steroids and other drugs among athl etes in competitive settings. Enhancement is commonly understood to refer to changes that alter what is \"normal,\" whether for humans as a whole or for a particular individual prior to enhancement. The question of what is meant by normal is then arises. Is it av erage? Is it whatever na ture has prescribed? Is it whatever luck has wrought? Given the wide ra nge of capabilities exhibited by humans for any particular trait, there is little basis for d eeming any one condition normal or any meaningful value in determining an average. Nonetheless, th ere have been some attempts to describe the range of conditions that, given the right environment, are consistent with an ability to appreciate life and participate in the world. This chapter begins by reviewing several key is sues in genome editing for enhancement. It then addresses in turn somatic (nonheritable) and germline (heritable) genome editing for enhancement purposes. The chapter ends with conclusions and recommendations.

Many diseases are as sociated with DNA vari ants, and the common term used to describe a variant\u2014\"mutation\" \u2014has therefore taken on a negative connotation in common parlance. A distinction often is made between \"normal\" and \"mutant\" or \"disease (-causing)\" genes, with the latter being viewed negatively. The term \"normal\" also is applied to phenotype, or the individual traits that result from interactio n between the genotype and the environment. Here it is important to note that the \"normal\" distribution of any given trait (e.g., height, weight, strength, aural or visual acuity) covers a wide spectrum and can be affected by many factors, including but by no means limited to, gene variants, which of ten interact both with each other and with environmental factors. He nce, the term \"normal\" denotes a range or spectrum, not some ideal state. The word \"natural\" has similarly taken on a positive connotation refl ecting a common view that nature produces things that are healthier and generally better than anything artificial\u2014this despite evidence demonstrating that \"natural\" things can be either safe or intrinsically dangerous. In the present context, genetic variants that exis t in nature may either support health or cause disease, and the human population contains multi ple variants of most genes (see Chapter 4). Thus, there is no single \"normal\" human genome sequence; rather, there are multiple variant human genomic sequences (IGSR, 2016), all of wh ich occur in the worldwide human gene pool and, in that sense, are \"natural,\" and all of whic h can be either advantageo us or disadvantageous. At any given position in the genome, some variants are more common than others. Some are beneficial and some detrimental, their effects at times depending on such factors as whether a person has one copy (heterozygosity) or two copies (homozygosity) of the variant, or whether the gene is sex-chromosome-linked (hemizygous for a gene on the Y chromosome and either heterozygous or homozygous on the X chromosome ). Another factor may be the particular environment in which a person lives. A well-known example is the case of sickle-cell anemia. Hemoglobin is the protein that carries oxygen in red blood cells. The most widespread variant encodes a fully functional protei n, whereas the sickle-cell variant can cause the protein to aggregate and distort the red ce lls into a sickle shape if both copies of the gene are this variant (the homozygous state), which in tu rn causes the symptoms of sick le-cell disease. As noted in Chapter 5, however, being heterozygous for this va riant confers some resistance to malaria, and for this reason, the sickle-cell va riant has been maintained by na tural selection in populations from malaria-prone areas (e.g., Africa, India, and the Mediterranean), the disadvantages of sickle-cell disease at the populat ion level being balanced agains t the population-level advantages of resistance to malaria. So, in this case, which natural varian t is advantageous depends on the environment. In this report, the committee uses the term \"v ariant\" and eschews to the extent possible the use of \"mutant\" or \"normal\" in referring to ge ne variants. There is, however, a distinction worth keeping in mind. Many variants are \"natural,\" and changing a gene va riant that is associated with disease, such as the sickle-cell variant of he moglobin, to a variant that is prevalent in the population (i.e., \"natural\") but not disease-causing can be viewed as a therapeutic or preventive change. It is also possible, how ever, to envision the possibility of changing a gene to a variant form that does not exist (or is rare) in the human gene pool but has some property that could be viewed as an \"enhancement\" since it is predicted to have a beneficial effect.

UNDERSTANDING PUBLIC ATTITUDES TOWARD ENHANCEMENT Personal improvements take many forms. They can require significant personal effort, as in taking piano lessons, or they can be largely independent of persona l effort, as in wearing teeth- straightening braces. They can be temporary, as in benefiting from the caffeine in morning coffee, or long-lasting, as in immunization against disease. They can be easily reversible, as in hair coloring, or reversible only with difficulty, as in cosmetic surgery. And they can be provided in connection with a corr ective intervention, as in removing cat aracts and inserting lenses that provide greater acuity than the person ever had naturally. All of these factors influence how improvements are evaluated in terms of fairness and public acceptability. Although surveys indicate signif icant support for gene therapy and genetic engineering to improve health of both existing individuals and unborn children (see Table 6-1), the possibility of \"enhancement\" in new and potentially more wi de-ranging ways can engender anxiety as well as enthusiasm. In 2016, a Pew study of surveys of more than 4,000 individuals revealed that anxiety outpaced enthusiasm, not only for enhancement through somatic genome editing but also for mechanical and transplant-related enhancem ent (Pew Research Center, 2016). A single study is not definitive, and public opinion on novel in terventions in some ot her controversial areas (such as in vitro fertilization) has become more favorab le over time and w ith evidence of successes. But the Pew study and many others sugge st that policy in this area needs to be developed with full attention to public attitudes and understandings.

Sometimes, the lines between therapy, preventi on, and enhancement are blurred, and even the definition of a \"disease\" that is to be cured or prevented can be open to debate. For this reason, the distinctions between pr eventing or treating disease and disability (i.e., \"therapy\") and the notion of \"enhancement\" may not fully captu re either public attitudes or public policy options. To the extent that there is any public di squiet about the use of gene therapy for disease prevention as opposed to treatment, it appears to be linked to more gene ralized concerns about \"meddling with nature\" or \"crossing a line we should not cross\" (Macer et al., 1995) (see Chapter 5). This is even more true for interventions that appe ar unrelated to either disease treatment or prevention. As noted above, Americans appear to be largely unenthusiastic about the idea of \"enhancement\" (Blendon et al., 2016; Pew Research Center, 2 016; see Table 6-1). It is possible that this lack of enthusiasm is due in part to hesitation conc erning innovation, which has been shown to be a common phe nomenon throughout history, ranging from things Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Resist ance or skepticism may be an outgrowth of concerns about the degree to which an innovati on affects cultural identity or may distort socioeconomic patterns in a fashion that is harmfu l to at least some part of the population. If and when these concerns are either addressed th rough remedial measures or shown to be unwarranted, innovations that are needed or perceived as desira ble become widely accepted. What is unclear is whether genome editing for enhancement would follow such a pattern or would be such a disruptive application of a ne w technology that the resi stance would persist over time or new concerns emerge as the technology progresses and new applications emerge. \"Status quo bias,\" is a phenomenon in which the preferen ce for what is familiar can affect the way people form judgments about the merits of an innovation. The predisposition toward the status quo may arise from concerns abou t transition costs (i.e., how people adapt to the circumstances arising from an innovation), about risk (with inn ovations assumed to have risks that are less amenable to measurement relative to the status quo), about deviation from what is natural (people holding the unwarranted belief that the past processe s of natural evolution have optimized humans for the current environment), and about effects on indi viduals (concern that technology will diminish the quality of relationships between people). A means of testing for whether status quo bias is affecting the eval uation of new technology has been suggested. In this \"reversal test,\" one asks, for example, whether those who think people should not have more in fluence over their traits would also think it would be good if people had less influence (Bostrom and Ord, 2006). Th e test is intended to distinguish concerns about an innovation itself from concerns about any move away from the status quo. It can be useful when juxtaposed with arguments about a \"slippery slope\" (see Chapter 5) because it helps distinguish concerns about the technology as it is used today from concerns about future unwanted extensions of the technology. DRAWING LINES: THERAPY VERSUS ENHANCEMENT Given the wide range of other interventions people make to alter their bodies and their personal circumstances, any discussion of so-cal led \"enhancement\" must begin with a working definition. Enhancement has been variously defined as \"boosting one's capabilities beyond the species-typical level or statistically normal range of function,\" \"a nont herapeutic intervention intended to improve or extend a human trait,\" or \"improvements in the capacities of existing individuals or future generati ons\" (Daniels, 2000; NSF, 2010; Pr esident's Council on Bioethics, 2003). One definition focuses on interventions th at improve bodily condition or function beyond what is needed to restore or sustain health (P arens, 1998). This is a definition that addresses intent as much as the technical intervention, as most interven tions can be used either to \"enhance\" or to restore. For example, under this definition, improving musc ulature for patients with muscular dystrophy would be restorative wh ereas doing so for individuals with no known pathology and average capability would be considered enhancement. Recognizing the importance of intent as an aspect of \"enhancement\" is helpful, as most biomedical interventions will be subject (in the United States) to regulation by the FDA, whose statutory authority explicitly links the initial risk-benefit balance ne eded for approval to the \"intended\" use of the product, even though postapproval uses can rang e beyond that original intended purpose. Another definitional matter concerns the meaning of \"therapy.\" It is understood to encompass treatment of a disease (t he definition of which is itself subject to debate, as discussed Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance ENHANCEMENT 111 PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION in section on fairness and enhancement, below). Bu t prevention of disease al so often is viewed as being encompassed within therapy. To reduce risk of breast cancer in a pe rson of average health and with nondeleterious variants, for example, is not to cure a disease or even to prevent one that is likely to occur, but this booste d resistance is often viewed as therapeutic prevention, akin to immunization against infectious diseases. A sim ilar point pertains with respect to reducing cholesterol in persons at no more than average risk for heart disease; this is already a widespread practice in American society, and statins and aspi rin are widely used to enhance resistance to heart disease pharmacologically even for those no t at high risk. Genome edits for such purposes could be similarly health-promoting. BOX 6-1 Making Distinctions In the 1970s, certain central distinctions were drawn (Juengst, 1997; Walters and Palmer, 1997). First, the distinction between somatic and germline genome modifications was established: somatic enhancements affect only a single individual but heritable enhancements can be passed down through the generations. Discussions of heritable enhancements included concerns about possible effects on the gene pool and fears of a return to some form of eugenics. Second, a distinction was drawn between treating or preventing disease (therapy) and enhancement. Discussions of enhancement focused on issues such as safety and (especially in competitive environments such as sports) unfair advantage, with the definition of \"unfair\" highly dependent on context. Available technology and the desire of prominent scientists to mitigate social concerns surrounding genetics\u2014particularly after the Asilomar conference organized by scientists in 1975 to discuss the risks and benefits of recombinant DNA techniques\u2014pushed the debate even further in the direction of the distinction bet ween \"medicine\" or \"therapy\" versus \"enhancement.\" It is important to note, as well, that somatic therapy to treat very severe diseases was all that any responsible scientist could imagine actually doing with the technology of the time. An influential schematic was developed in the early 1970s (and depicted in table below), which defined cells 1 and 2 as \"medicine\" and as the \"treatment of hereditary diseases,\" respectively (Anderson and Kulhavy, 1972, p. 109), as opposed to enhancements (somatic or heritable) in cells 3 and 4. TABLE Schematic for Therapy versus Enhancement Purpose Somatic Germline Therapeutic Treatment of Disease Somatic Therapy (Cell 1) Germline Therapy (Cell 2) Enhancement of Capabilities Enhancement (Cell 4) Somatic Enhancement (Cell 3) Germline By the mid-1980s, scientists and bioethicists had begun to call for the morally relevant line to be between disease and enhancement rather than somatic and germline. John Fletcher, then head of bioethics at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), wrote that \"the most relevant moral distinction is between uses that may relieve real suffering and those that alter characteristics that have little or nothing to do with disease\" (Fletcher et al., 1985). Gene therapy pioneer Theodore Friedmann wrote that \"the need for efficient disease control or the need to prevent damage early in development or in inaccessible cells may eventually justify germline therapy\" (Friedmann, 1989). In 1991, as the first three somatic gene therapy trials were under way, the chair of the Human Gene Therapy Subcommittee of NIH's Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) called for \"a detailed public discussion of the ethical issues surrounding germline genetic intervention in humans\" (Walters, 1991).

Before the modern tools needed to modi fy DNA were developed, government-supported research was focused on developing solid-organ tr ansplantation to replace damaged or diseased organs and on bone marrow transplantation and r econstitution to cure leukemia and other life- threatening disorders, even though these treat ments required substitu ting donor DNA for the patient's DNA in the solid-organ or blood-forming cells. Those cases fell clearly under what is typically considered medical care. Government-s upported research also has been conducted in many countries to advance the fi elds of gene therapy and rege nerative medicine, and, more recently, human genome editing, to modify the DNA in the blood-forming cells of patients with sickle-cell disease and other blood disorders or some forms of cancer. These precedents, and many others like them, have built robust scientif ic, regulatory, and ethical oversight structures (see Chapter 4). As noted above, many discussions of the ethi cs of enhancement have been based on contrasting the concepts of \"therapy\" and \"enha ncement.\" However, given the evolution of the role of the physician over the past several decades from a healer of the sick to a promoter of health through preventive measures, the therapy- enhancement duality needs to be modified to accommodate a wide range of preventive interventions , such as vaccines, that are neither therapy nor enhancement but blend into each at the edge s. For example, while genome editing to lower the cholesterol level of a patient with severe coro nary artery disease would likely be viewed as a therapy, and genome editing of a sibling of the pa tient with high cholesterol who also had other risk factors for coronary artery disease might be viewed as a pr eventive measure, genome editing to lower the cholesterol of a hea lthy 21-year-old child of the patie nt to reduce disease risk below what is average or \"normal\" in the general popul ation might be viewed as approaching the line between prevention and enhancement. Interventions thus can be viewed as falling on a therapy- prevention-enhancement spectrum, although the boundari es between the three categories are still open to debate and will likely vary wi th the specifics of the intervention. With the growth in understanding of the human genome and of which sequence variants are associated with which conditions, the number of traits that could be addressed by genome editing continues to grow. This growing potential again raises the question of what it means to be \"normal\" and whether deviations from \"normality \" are really a disease. Everyone would agree that the manifestation of Tay-Sachs disease is not normal and constitutes a disease, but opinions differ as to whether genetically caused deafness s hould be considered a disease. It is not normal in the sense of being typical or be ing consistent with the range of capabilities typically associated with the human species, but it can also be asso ciated with membership in a community of persons sharing this characteristic , many of whom reject the notion that deaf people need to be \"cured\" or otherwise treated to eliminate or circumvent their lack of hearing. Commentators have noted that the concept of di sease is not always objective, but rather can be the result of social agreement influenced by power and prejudice. In the 1950s, for example, homosexuality was considered a disease, and ev en today it is occasionally the subject of \"therapeutic\" interventions aimed at \"curing\" it. In the 1930s, \"criminality\" was considered a Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Some disability activists began to question whethe r such traits as dwarfism or deafness should be considered diseases instead of variants that enrich human diversity. It is a question that led to discussions about where the line is drawn between normal and pathological, as well as questions about who gets to draw thes e lines; what authority do they have to draw them; which social dimensions are included or ex cluded; and what provisi on is made to contest the decisions. The discovery of variants that simply increa se the odds of developing a disease and others that are associated with diseases whose onset is in later life also has blurred the previously bright line demarcating \"disease.\" Early ethical debate built on language used by the pioneers in human genetics, who referred to \"inborn er rors,\" noting that most traits targeted for modification were called \"errors,\" as in mistakes from what wa s supposed to be. The greatest challenge for the normality standard came from some researcher s considering what might best be called enhancements for the purpose of relieving diseas e. This enhancement would not correct errors, but rather instill traits that some lucky minority of humans already have, such as by enhancing immune function or adding cellular receptors to capture cholesterol (Juengst, 1997; Parens, 1998; Walters and Palmer, 1997). Such alterations could be viewed as \"enhancements\" or as leveling the playing field for those not lucky enough to have these traits at birth, a nd they also complicate the distinction between therapy and enhan cement unless one includes prevention as an intermediate. Evolution of the Unfair Social Advantage Demarcation While both the somatic/germline and disease/e nhancement distinctions have been useful, they (like most categories) are imperfect. Some commentators have focused instead on the effect of an intervention and whether that effect is \"fair.\" Changes not made by personal effort (such as exercise or music practice) but by external forces (such as hair coloring and cosmetic surgery) are understood to have the capacity to generate a social advantage, but it is an advantage within the realm of species-typi cal attributes. For some, such changes are made purely for pleasure; for others they represent an effort to \"normalize\" or \"even the odds\" with those who have the most favored appearances. Externa lly induced changes that offe r more significant or unusual advantages, such as those provi ding greater muscle mass or more acute vision or obviating the need for sleep, raise questions about the authen ticity of the resulting capacity and whether the individual newly endowed with these capabili ties is somehow diminished by having failed to earn them. Yet people are born with unearned varying capacities, some markedly superior to the norm, which raises the question of whether and when an advantage becomes \"unfair.\" This is a difficult question to answer precisely because of the highly uneven distribution of abilities in the human population. Unless one assi gns great importance to fate, it is difficult to tease out enhancements that allow individuals to fairly match the capacities of others from those that are \"unnatural,\" \"abnormal,\" or \"excessi ve.\" Furthermore, any attempt to relate enhancement to what is \"normal\" or \"average\" risks categorizing efforts to combat widespread \"normal\" but undesirable aspects of life (e.g., ag e-related declining ey esight, hearing, and mobility) as a form of \"enhancem ent,\" with all the pejorative connotations implied by the word. Society already condones such efforts fo r many conditions (cataract surgery, hip replacement) using methods other than genome editing. Some respond to inequality in access by favoring interventions that provide more care to more people, and eschew research investment and insurance coverage in high-cost innova tions. This may be a response to economic Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 114 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION conditions, or a philosophical view of infirmity as a na tural part of life, not necessarily in need of every possible measure for treatment and prevention. Other societies have responded to inequalities that ar ise from differential access to medical innovations by trying to increase access and insurance coverage , rather than by restricting research or the marketing of new products or technologies. Unp acking such differences requires distinguishing between restrictions on the research itself and deci sions about insurance to cover treatments, a topic that in turn requires inquiry into whether in surance is primarily a public good or a privately purchased service. Even for societies that tend toward expanding access to respond to inequality, a core concern for some is that enhancements are yet anothe r benefit that would accrue primarily to the individual, without a bene fit to the population as a whole. John Rawls' influential theory of justice emphasizes the idea of e quality. He observes that the luck with which someone is born healthy, talented, or in favored so cial circumstances is neither earn ed nor deserved. From this he concludes not that all people must be equalized in outcomes but that further distribution of social goods should be designed to account for this initial inequality. This notion leads to so-called equality-based reciprocity, such that inequali ties should be tolerated only when they somehow accrue to the population's general ad vantage, in particular to the advantage of those least well- off (Rawls, 1999). Some might conclude, therefore, that a problematic enhancement is one that confers a social advantage beyond that which an individual possesses by fate or through pers onal effort, and that does not benefit the rest of society in any way or undermines the implicit goals of a competition. Using equality of opportunity and societally usef ul inequality as guides may help distinguish those forms of enhancement that might gene rally be tolerated (assuming the risks are proportional to the benefits) from those that would be more controversial. Of course, somatic or germline genome editing for enhancement is very unlikely to be the most profound source of inequality in any setting. But those most uncomfortable with using genome editing for enhancement will likely still be concerned re gardless of the size of its contribution. Looking across these themes, one might conclude th at enhancement per se is not the focus of concern, but rather the underlying intent and subsequent effect. On e response to this concern is to focus on the technologies and applications and to restrict those most likely to be used to unacceptably exacerbate inequalities. A different response is to insist that communities and governments work to make advantageous enhan cements available more generally and focus on reducing undesirable inequalities. Within this range of responses lies the choice of governance policy. Governance of Nonheritable Somatic Edit ing for Enhancement of the Individual The governance and ethics of human enhancemen t have long been the subject of policy reports. Most recently, the U.S. Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues focused on human enhancement related to the us e of drugs that affect neurological function (Bioethics Commission, 2015), and the European Excellence in Processing Open Cultural Heritage (EPOCH) project summarized the pr evailing modes of governance and the roles of academics and bioethicists in these debates, as well as areas of missing evidence needed to identify real possibilities (European Commi ssion, 2012). Earlier efforts include a 2009 report by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) (2010) and a 2003 report by the U.S. President's Council on Bioethics (2003). In th e United Kingdom, the Academy of Medical Sciences, British Academy, Royal Academy of Engi neering, and The Royal Society came together in 2012 for a Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

And the French Na tional Advisory Committee on Ethics and the Life Sciences and the Singapore National Bioe thics Commission both produced reports in 2013 focused specifically on neuroenhancement (NCE CHLS, 2013) and neuroscience research (BAC Singapore, 2013). All of these reports reflect broad input from the me dical, bioethical, and academic communities and provide a rich source of information on the concerns that have been raised about enhancements, as well as the prof ound challenges entailed in clearly delineating the differences among therapy, prevention, and enhancement. In the United States, governance of enhancemen t applications of genome editing would fall, as with other gene therapy, to the FDA, the RAC, the IBCs and the IRBs, and the legislature (see Chapter 2). The RAC can provide a venue for discussion of somatic enhancement proposals. 60 IRBs and the FDA look at whether the benefits th e enhancement might provi de to the individual, to science, and to society are r easonable in light of the risks to the individual, to public health, and to environmental safety. But concerns about culture or societal morals, while important, are generally not within the IRB's remit; the regulations state th at the IRB \"should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (for example, the possible effects of the research on public policy) as among those re search risks th at fall within the purview of its responsibil ity\" (45 CFR Sec. 46.111(a)(2)). Thus if a protocol holds the potential for grea t benefit to individuals , and those individuals are willing to accept greater risk, the regulator and IRB may agree that this meets the standard of the possible benefits being reasona ble in relation to the risks. If the regulator and IRB decide, however, that there are no real bene fits of an enhancement\u2014either to the individual or to science \u2014then even a minimal risk is unjustified. As human genome editing im proves technologically, there is every reason to believe that the health an d safety risks to individuals will diminish. If these risks become de minimis, one might assume that the potential benefits required to justify the risks also will decline. Thus as the technology improves, its application could extend from serious illnesses, to less serious illnesses, to prevention, and in the long-term, to enhancement, however defined. In the United States, it is also important to ke ep in mind that once a medical product has been approved for a particular purpose and population, th e sponsor is limited to marketing it for these \"labeled\" indications, but indivi dual physicians are free to use th eir own judgment and prescribe the product for other uses and other populations61 (see Chapter 4). This \"off-label\" use complicates the question of govern ance in the United States and in other jurisdictions with similar rules, such as the European Union, because it makes it more difficult to restrict the use of new medical products to those situ ations that have the best risk /benefit ratios and the general support of the public. With regard to enhancements, this regulatory scheme has raised concern that some products will be approved for treatment or prevention of disease but then be used off-label for riskier or less well-justified uses. As noted in Chapter 4, howe ver, the specificity of these edited cells will 60At the moment, the RAC is not accepting germline ed iting protocols for review (see Chapters 2 and 5). 6159 Federal Register 59, 820, 59, 821 (November 18, 1994). \"Once a [drug] product has been approved for marketing, a physician may prescribe it for uses or in treatment regimens of patient populations that are not included in approved labeling.\" The notice goes on to state that \"'unapproved' or, mo re precisely, 'unlabeled' uses may be appropriate and rational in cert ain circumstances, and may in fact reflect ap proaches to drug therapy that have been extensively reported in medical literature.\" Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

While one might imagine a genome-edite d cell therapy for musc ular dystrophy being of interest to those with healthy muscle tissue who wish to b ecome even stronger, other examples are more difficult to envision. The specificity of edited cells will make such applications less likely for the foreseeable future. In addition, the FDA has some authority to re strict off-label uses\u2014for example, through requirements for special patient testing or adverse ev ent reporting\u2014and the U.S. Congress can pass legislation to specifically prohibit certai n uses, as has been the case for human growth hormone (see Box 6-2). Other jurisdictions ha ve similar powers and choices. Nonetheless, attention to the possible range of off-label uses is necessary, and the need for some control over off-label use can be anticipated. BOX 6-2 Human Growth Hormone The experience with human growth hormone illustrates the difficulty of finding clear boundaries between therapy and prevention, and between treatment and enhancement. It is also a lesson in how a sudden change in the ease or availability of a technology or intervention can make those boundaries\u2014previously of little importance\u2014suddenly become the subject of professional norms, public opinion and legal controls. Human growth hormone (hGH) was a scarce commodity for many years, and its use was largely limited to 'treatment' for those who lacked normal levels of the hormone (Ayyar, 2011). With the development of synthetic human growth hormone in 1985, the newly increased supply of affordable hGH triggered a lively debate about whether there ought to be constraints on its use. For example, hGH could now be given to children or adults in good health but with unexplained short stature, ranging from <1st percentile of height for their age to being only slightly shorter than their peers. Some others sought hGH despite being of normal height and growth rate, with an interest in attaining above-average height or strength. Whether or not administration of hGH in these and many other ca ses reflected a favorable risk-benefit ratio, whether they qualified as treatment, prevention, or enhancement, and which of those uses might be appropriate, required careful scientific and ethical investigation. The fact that the hormone would be administered to children too young to make decisions for themselves added to the complexity of the conversation. The risks and possible benefits of hGH administration were uncertain in the 80's and 90's, and the drug was approved only for severe cases of growth hormone deficiency in children. But over time growth hormone therapy was shown to be reasonably safe and effective for patients with low levels of the hormone in their blood or who experienced severely stunted growth despite normal levels of hormone; studies showed it bringing children up to the 10th to 25th percentile, depending on dosage and timing of treatment (Allen and Cuttler, 2013; Maiorana and Cianfarani, 2009). But the treatment is not entirely risk-free; children can experience relatively minor or moderate adverse events such as respiratory congestion and headache (Bell et al., 2010; Cohen et al., 2002; Kemp et al., 2005; Lindgren and Ritzen, 1999; Willemsen et al., 2007). In addition, long-term risks have had considerably less study, and there is some evidence to suggest that children who receive hGH may have a slightly increased risk of stroke as adults (Ichord, 2014). The FDA approved human growth hormone for use in children and adults for a limited and narrowly defined list of indications, including children with growth disorders (e.g. chronic renal insufficiency, Turner's syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, Noonan syndrome) or severe unexplained short stature. For adults with severe growth hormone deficiency, treatment can result in modest gains in body composition, exercise capacity, and skeletal integrity (Molitch et Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance ENHANCEMENT 117 PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION al., 2011). They, as well as adults with AIDS-associated wasting syndrome, or short bowel syndrome also qualified for treatment (Ayyar, 2011; Cook and Rose, 2012; Cuttler and Silvers, 2010). Despite the absence of evidence that hGH supplementation increases muscle strength or aerobic exercise capacity in healthy individuals (Liu et al., 2007), some healthy adults have been drawn to hGH in hopes it would serve as a performance-enhancing drug or would slow the normal aging process. But this has been linked to a high risk of serious adverse effects, including diabetes, cancer, hypertension, muscle pain, joint pain, swelling and inflammation of soft tissue, carpal tunnel syndrome, and enlarged breast tissue in men (Liu et al., 2008; Perls and Handelsman, 2015). Additionally, there is some evidence that people with genetic resistance to growth hormone enjoy longer life s pans, suggesting that giving hGH to otherwise normally aging adults might actually shorten their lives (Suh et al., 2008). Despite these dangers, hGH was used by some athletes and aging adults (DEA, 2013). The FDA is responsible for regulation of prescription drugs, and federal law prohibits sponsors from advertising and marketing drugs for uses that go beyond their approved indications. But physicians are generally free to prescribe drugs for other indications not evaluated by the FDA (known as 'off-label' prescription), based on thei r own professional judgment and expertise. This is a common phenomenon with widely acknowledged benefits in cases of evolving information and physician experience, but the slippery slope trend toward off-label so-called \"enhancement\" uses of hGH led Congress to take the unusual step of enacting legislative restrictions. According to the Crime Control Act of 199062, the distribution of human growth hormone for non- approved indications, such as for anti-aging, age-related conditions, or enhancing athletic performance, is a felony punishable by fines and imprisonment. Both the FDA and the Drug Enforcement Agency interpret this amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act strictly to mean that off-label prescription of hGH is now illegal (Cronin, 2008; FDA, 2012a). In conjunction with formal regulatory proces ses, a number of other aspects of governance will affect whether and how genome editing is used for enhancement. These include professional guidelines, which influence physician behavior directly and set st andards against which physician behavior is judged in cases of possi ble malpractice (Campbell and Glass, 2000; Mello, 2001). Insurers that offer malpractice coverage also can influence the willingness of physicians to offer certain services (Kessler, 2011). In anot her capacity, insurers play a role by choosing to cover the cost of using approve d technologies based in part on the purpose for which they are going to be used and whether the use is necessary or elective. 62US Code Title 21 \u00a7 333(e) Prohibited distribution of human growth hormone (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), whoever knowingly distributes, or possesses with intent to distribute, human growth hormone for any use in humans other than the treatment of a disease or other recognized medical condition, where such use has been authorized by the S ecretary of Health and Human Services under section 355 of this title and pursuant to the order of a physician, is guilty of an offense punishable by not more than 5 years in prison, such fines as are authorized by title 18, or both.

In th e context of the discussions ar ound enhancement, this prospect may deepen some of the disquiet concerning those applicat ions that are most distant from disease treatment, disease prevention, a nd correction of significant physic al or social disadvantages relative to the norm. This disquiet is influen ced not only by the concerns outlined above with respect to somatic genome editing but also by the long and troubling history of eugenics, a history that included coercive m easures and even genocide. This history is replete with dogma that creates hierarchies of hu man quality based on race, reli gion, national origin, and economic status, and it demonstrates how scientific concep ts, such as natural selection, and public welfare measures, such as public hygiene, can be subverted for purposes of cruel and destructive social policies. These considerations lead to the ques tion of whether \"enhancem ent\" applications of heritable germline editing should be prohibited en tirely or significantly restricted in ways measurably different than those for purely non-heritable somatic editing? Eugenics The term \"eugenics\" was first used in the late 19th century to define the goal of improving the human species by giving \"the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the le ss suitable\" (Kevles, 1985). The general idea was to create schemes for encouraging people w ith \"good\" bloodlines to have more children and those with \"bad\" bloodlines to have fewer or no children in order to improve the human species. Given their extremely limited understanding of what traits we re truly heritable, eu genicists in various societies applied their social biases in ways now deemed unacceptable. In Britain, eugenicists assumed that the \"good\" traits were those found among the upper classes. They inferred that the fine qualities of the aristocracy were heritable, so the poor shoul d simply produce fewer children. In the United States, the original eugenic im pulse involved race or et hnicity. One eugenic goal was to keep races with \"bad\" traits from immigra ting to America. The peak effort in meeting this goal was the 1924 immigration control act, which lim ited immigrants from Eastern and southern Europe. It was signed by President Coolidge, who had earlier claimed that \"America must be kept American\" because \"biological laws show th at Nordics deteriorate when mixed with other races\" (Kevles, 1985). By the 1920s, countries increasi ngly looked at people' s individual qualities independent of their race and class, trying to identify those with supposed ly genetic traits such as \"feeblemindedness\" and \"criminality\" and discou raging them from reproducing. These eugenics programs were not necessarily voluntary, and many felons and women were forcibly sterilized. Most famously, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes of the U.S. Supreme Court wrote the opinion that allowed the sterilization of Carrie Bu ck, a \"feebleminded\" woman, concluding that sterilization was justified because \"[i]t is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing thei r kind.

The logic of eugenics was taken to its extr eme conclusion in Nazi Germany, where those perceived to have genetically derived limitations we re first sterilized and in later years killed. The logic of eugenic purity was a part of the Ho locaust, which resulted in the deaths of millions of people portrayed as genetic inferiors, prim arily Jews, Roma, and those with disabilities. According to historian Daniel Ke vles, after revelation of the Holo caust, people realized that \"a river of blood would eventually run from the German sterilization law of 1933 to Auschwitz and Buchenwald\" (Kevles, 1985, p. 118). Reform Eugenics Revelation of the Holocaust was not the end of eugenics, only th e end of race-based, coercive, state-mandated eugenics . Many scientists had already re jected the mainstream eugenic view, with Hermann Muller writing in 1935 that eugenics had become \"hopelessly perverted\" into a pseudoscientific facade fo r \"advocates of race and class pr ejudice, defenders of vested interests of church and state, Fascists, Hitlerites, and reactiona ries generally\" (Kevles, 1985, p. 164). Muller and other prominent scientists, such as Julian Huxley, w ould create a \"reform\" eugenics that sought to stop the reproduction of people with gene tic disease and encourage more reproduction by people with \"superior\" genes\u2014from whatever race and class. People would be encouraged to change their reproductive practices voluntarily for the good of the species. Most notably for future debates, these thinkers wanted humanity to seize cont rol of its own evolution and improve the species in various ways, such as by making humans more intelligent. The ethical debate of the 1950s through the early 197 0s was quite broad, often focused on what the goals for genetic modification as a species should be. In a theme that would recur from this era forward, some critics of reform eugenics averre d that humans should be satisfied with the way they are. In general, the ethica l debate was about the genetic go als of the species\u2014or whether to have such goals at all (Evans, 2002). In 1953, Crick and Watson described the struct ural basis of how DN A duplicates itself (Watson and Crick, 1953), leading to unders tanding of how the DNA of genes encodes information. This discovery changed the ethical debate concerning eugeni cs as people realized that if genes were actually chemicals whose stru cture could be characterized, society no longer would have to rely on \"who mates with whom\"; ra ther, people could be chemically modified to have \"more\" of the \"good\" genes. Robert Sinshe imer, a prominent scien tist of the time, was typical in his response, writing in 1969 that \"the old eugenics would have required a continual selection for breeding of the fit, and a culling of the unfit. The new eugenics would permit in principle the conversion of all of the unfit to the highest genetic level ... for we should have the potential to create new ge nes and new qualities yet undreamed in the human species\" (Sinsheimer, 1969, p. 13). Theologian Paul Rams ey wrote in 1970 that such proposals would make \"man\" \"his own self-creator\" and lead to a new theology of science (Ramsey, 1970, p. 144). Whether to improve the species and if so, in wh at way was the core of the ethical debate until the early 1970s. A discussion then\u2014one con tinuing today among some transhumanists\u2014is whether human evolution should be left to proc esses of natural select ion, which are random and 63Buck v.

For example, Corneliu Giurgea, the Romanian chemist who synthesized Piracetam in 1964 and showed that it might act in cognitive enhancement, said, \"Man is not going to wait passively for millions of years before evolution offers him a better brain\" (Giurgea, 1973). Indeed, with the specter of climate cha nge on earth and the imagined colonization of Mars, some transhumanists today discuss whether humans need to intervene in their own evolution to cope with the fu ture they are creating (Bostrom, 2005; Rosen, 2014). But in the 1970s, the evident complexity of making change s, let alone determining which changes are desirable, led many to rethink what prominen t biologist Bernard Davis would dub \"Promethean predictions of unlimited control.\" He reminded read ers of facts now considered obvious, such as that most \"enhanced characteristics\" are polygen ic and thus difficult or impossible to modify (Davis, 1970, p. 1279). Technological limits of that era also helped shape the debate. It was impossible to imagine somatic enhancements when somatic therapy was not yet successful, so any claim of a somatic enhancement would have been considered too risky, with very little benefit. Similarly, if early attempts at modifying somatic ce lls through viral vectors were succ essful in only a small number of the cells, how could sperm, eggs, or zygot es be changed? But where enhancement and heritable change came together, even though not yet technically feasib le, public concern was greatest. And the goal of the eugenicists\u2014to make the species better\u2014was placed in this category, thus comingling the rejection of eugeni cs with the possibilitie s for germline editing. Slippery Slope Concerns abou t Germline Enhancement Opponents of germline enhancement from the re form eugenics era forward were concerned largely with long-term cultural or social changes that could occur as the result of a sociological slippery slope process (see also Chapter 5). That is, would somatic therapy eventually lead to efforts to enhance the species th rough germline engineering, a proce ss that might evolve as skill and familiarity with somatic therapy made it easie r to imagine other applications as helpful and safe? These opponents were wil ling to endorse somatic ther apy because they thought the somatic/germline distinction was culturally strong, and the public w ould make a clear distinction between modifying individuals and modifying their offsprin g (Burgess and Prentice, 2016). This sort of slippery slope argument emerge d in 1981 after a U.S. Supreme Court decision that allowed the patenting of genetically engine ered life forms (Evans, 2002). Concerns were raised about \"the fundame ntal nature of human life and the dignity and worth of the individual human being\" (President's Commission, 1982, p. 95) . The presidential bioe thics commission of that era wrote a report entitled Splicing Life , in which it reformulated the ethical debate so that the report would be \"meaningful to public po licy consideration\" (President's Commission, 1982, p. 20). To make ethical claims legally actionable meant moving away from arguments about future cultural harms or claims that it is not th e role of humanity to modify itself. Consequences needed to be more concrete and near-term, not speculative. In the report, the commission stated that it \"could find no ground for c oncluding that any current or planned forms of genetic engineering, whether using huma n or nonhuman material, are intr insically wrong or irreligious per se \" (President's Commission, 1982, p. 77). The repor t established a framework of risks and benefits and the rights of indivi duals that would serve as a fr amework for government regulation of this new science, such as through the human gene therapy subcommittee of the RAC. It was an approach not particularly amenable to consider ation of broader and longer-term social effects, for instance slippery slopes, due to its focus on more immediate effects on identifiable persons.

Most notably, the commission was concer ned about the promotion of in equality; about parents having the ultimate power over their children (Council on Bioethics, 2003, p. 44). The report did not have a strong impact on policy regarding human genetic modification, but made it clear that some in U.S. society viewed germline genetic mo dification through this pa rticular ethical lens. The concern of the Bush-era commission that germline enhancement might encourage people to view children as something to be desi gned and manipulated has long been a concern of some social scientists and humanists. Political theorist Michael Sandel wr ote that \"to appreciate children as gifts is to accept them as they come , not as objects of our design or products of our will or instruments of our ambition. Parental love is not contingent on the talents and attributes a child happens to have\" (Sandel, 2013, p. 349). One implication is that potential parents should refrain from making modifications that would directly benefit thei r future child, not necessarily because they would see their own child differently, but rather because it might in a tiny, indirect yet cumulative way promote a culture that comes to see all children differently. But critics of this view would argue the harm is specu lative, and that this level of freedom in the relationship of the individual to society is well with in the range of what we allow in liberal democratic societies. Another concern that has b een raised revolves around wh ether parents might become increasingly viewed as responsib le for the qualities of their of fspring. According to Sandel, \"we attribute less to chance and more to choice. Pa rents become responsible for choosing, or failing to choose, the right traits for their children\" (Sandel, 2004). A similar idea is expressed in the more relig ious language of making versus begetting. Theologian Gilbert Meilaender desc ribes designing the genetic qualiti es of one's children as akin to \"making\" them, whereas nondesign is \"begetting\" them. More important, and like Sandel, he states that \"what we beget is like ourselves. What we make is not; it is the product of our free decision, and its destiny is ours to determine\" (M eilaender, 1996). By this view, begetting (i.e., nondesign) is critical to human dignity and human rights because \"we are equal to each other, whatever our distinctions in ex cellence of various so rts, precisely because none of us is the 'maker' of another one of us\" (Meilaender, 2008, p. 264). These concerns about objectification might possibly apply to germline c onversion to genes associated w ith ordinary health, but would more likely be raised by enhancem ents, health-related or beyond. There are other views, of course. One might say that making choices about our genetic future\u2014whether they increase the perception that humans ar e more like objects or not\u2014is precisely human. As Joseph Fletcher , one of the founders of bioeth ics, wrote in 1971: \"Man is a maker and a selecter and a designer, and the more rationally contrived an d deliberate anything is, the more human it is.... [T]he real difference is between accidental or random reproduction and rationally willed or chosen repr oduction\" (Fletcher, 1971, pp. 780-781). Others have argued that parent al discretion allows for a wide range of practices, provided they are not significantly harmfu l to the physical or psychological development of a child (Robertson, 2008). As discussed in Chapter 5, th is would require a pu re reproductive rights framework that must be stretched to its limits in order to encompass th e right to enhance or diminish traits (Robertson, 2004). It is a vision of parental libe rty that already encompasses a wide range of enhancements of infants and ch ildren, including biomedical measures such as Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

By extens ion, it could be argued that this liberty encompasses germline enhancements with sim ilar risk/benefit bala nces. Here again, though, there is very little reason to th ink that in the United States, th e constitutional cases on parenting would prevent the government from banning germ line genome editing if it had a rational basis for doing so. There has also been the emergence of academic transhumanism as a contributor to these debates. Transhumanists argue not only fo r the ethical legitimacy of some forms of enhancement-oriented germline editing, but perhaps even for pa rental responsibility and an ethical obligation to take advant age of such enhancement possibilities for the benefit of one's children (Persson and Savelescu, 2012). One philo sopher has argued that we are obligated to make the best possible decisions for those who cannot decide for themselves, and this would include our future children and their descendants (Harris, 2007). These are arguments about moral obligations, however, as nothing in U.S. stat utes or judicial decisions (or those of other countries) imposes them as a matter of law. Overall, two distinct approaches to evalua ting the ethics of germline enhancement have emerged over the last half century. In one, the focus is more societal and philosophical. It encompasses not only the concerns raised about germline editing in general, as described in Chapter 5, but also concerns a bout altering how we view our children, and about creating or increasing social inequities in a multi-generati onal fashion due to the heritability of the enhancement. Even where the benefits of an individual enhancement might be regarded as justification for an individual in tervention, these analyses often f eature a concern about slippery slopes and an echo of eugenics movements of the past. In another approach, the disease/enhancement dis tinction remains largely useful, as it tracks well to the evaluation of individual risks and benefits. This evaluation is the focus of the regulatory bodies, such as the FDA, that re view new medical products for approval and the research oversight bodies that ov ersee protection of clinical tria l participants and others who might be put at physical risk from the trials. When diseases are cured or prevented, the benefit of trials is seen as greater relative to when f unctional traits are improved beyond what is necessary for a typical life. In turn, this gr adation of benefits is balanced against health risks for offspring and future generations, including the potential for disease prevention. Given that human germline genome editing has not yet been tested clinically for therapeutic or preventive purposes, it seems clear that germline genome editing for purposes of enhancement, that is, for reasons not clearly intended to cure or combat disease and disability, is very unlikely at this time to meet the standard of possible benefit and to lerable risk needed to initiate clinical trials. Even as risks recede with greater experience and information, truly discretionary and elective germline edits would be unlikely to have benefits outweighing even minor health risks. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Significant scientific progress will be necessary before any genome-editing intervention for indications other than the treatment or preven tion of disease or disa bility can satisfy the risk/benefit standards for initiating a clinical tr ial. This conclusion hol ds for both somatic and heritable germline interventions. There is signifi cant public discomfort with the use of genome editing for so-called \"enhancement\" of human traits and capacities beyond those typical of Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Therefore, a robust public disc ussion is needed concer ning the values to be placed upon the individual and societal benefits and risks of genome editing for purposes other than treatment or prevention of disease or disability. These discussions would include consideration of the potential for introducing or exacerbating societal ineq uities, so that these values can be incorporated as appropriate into the risk/benefit assessments that will precede any decision about whether to authorize clinical trials. RECOMMENDATION 6-1. Regulatory agenc ies should not at this time authorize clinical trials of somatic or germline genome editing for purposes other than treatment or preventi on of disease or disability.

Government bo dies should encourage public discussion and policy debate regarding governance of somatic human genome editing for purposes other than t reatment or prevention of disease or disability.

All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION 125 7 Public Engagement The emergence of CRISPR/Cas9 as a research tool in the area of human genome editing has lent new urgency to calls for a broad public dialogue about these technologies and their applications. These calls have come from ethicist s and social scientists (e.g., Jasanoff et al., 2015), as well as biomedical scientists (Bos ley et al., 2015; Doudna, 2015) and multiple think tanks, bioethics groups, and scie ntific/professional societies, such as The Hinxton Group (Chan et al., 2015), the Nuffield Council (2006b), and the Center for Genetic s and Society (2015). The idea itself is not new. At the Asilomar Conference in February 1975, an international group of scientists discussed the use of recombinant DNA and decided that strict controls should be placed on its use (Berg et al., 1975). The conc erns expressed by that group are reflected in a report to the U.S. Senate Committee on Hu man Resources Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research. That report argued that it was \"increasingly important to society that the serious problems which arise at the interface betw een science and society be carefully identified, and that mechanisms and models be devised, fo r the solution of these problems\" (Powledge and Dach, 1977, p. 1). These early efforts have evolved into a \"growi ng political commitment at the highest levels to giving citizens more of a voice in the decisions that affect their lives, and to engaging citizens in making government more responsive and accountable\" (Cornwall, 2008, p. 11). In a 2000 report, the UK House of Lords recommended that dialogue with the public be a mandatory and integral part of policy processes, including the use of public meetings as a tool for formal citizen engagement (UK House of Lords, 2000). Like wise, the 2003 U.S. Nanot echnology Research and Development Act mandated \"convening of regul ar and ongoing public discussions, through mechanisms such as citizens' panels, cons ensus conferences, and educational events.\"64 These efforts have been motivated in part by the desire to anticipate th e reactions of members of the public to potentially cont roversial technologies and to \"avoid unjustifiably inhibiting innovation, stigmatizing new technologi es, or creating trade barriers\" (Holdren et al., 2011, p. 1). Research also has shown that engaging mean ingfully with decision makers and public stakeholders \"in processes ... that incorporate di verse perspectives transparently\" can increase public perceptions of the legitimacy of regul atory or policy decisi ons surrounding emerging technologies (Posner et al., 2016, p. 1760). Th ese findings echo the conclusion of a 2008 National Research Council (NRC) consensus report that public part icipation in (environmental) 6421st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act, Public Law 108-153 (December 3, 2003).

All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 126 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION assessment and decision making has the potential to improve not just perceptions of legitimacy but also the quality of decisions (H oldren et al., 2011, p. 1; NRC, 2008). One could argue, for example, that a lack of meaningful engagement with different publics during the emergence of genetically modified or ganisms (GMOs) did irreparable damage to the emerging scientific field of gene tic engineering. Public debates a bout harmful effects of Bt corn on larvae of monarch butterflies, for instance, led to \"a nearly 10% drop in the value of Monsanto stock, possible trade restrictions by Japan, freezes on the approval process for Bt- transgenic corn by the European Commission (Bru ssels), and calls for a moratorium on further planting of Bt-corn in the United States\" (She lton and Roush, 1999). These debates have also slowed or halted the developmen t and introduction of biofortifi cation of some foods, such as golden rice, which has the potenti al to reduce disease caused by a vitamin A deficiency (VAD). The World Health Organization estimates that 250 million people suffer from VAD (nearly half of them children in the developing world), a nd it is a leading cause of childhood blindness, affecting between a quarter a nd a half million children worl dwide (Achenbach, 2016). A May 2016 report from the National Academies found that increasing micronutrien ts at appropriate levels in both conventional and genetically engin eered crops \"could have favorable effects on the health of millions of people\" (NASEM, 2016c). Some scholars have argued that human genome ed iting has raised, and will continue to raise, ethical, regulatory, and sociopolitical questions that go well beyond discussi ons of technical risks and benefits identified by biologists (Jasanoff et al., 2015) or even philosophical and sociopolitical concerns raised by social scientis ts and ethicists (Sarewit z, 2015). These scholars argue that the risks and benef its associated with human genom e editing should not be defined solely by the scientific community, and that a co mprehensive understanding of risks and benefits will require broad public debates th at are highly inclusive with respect to the range of voices and how relevant concepts are defined. This argumen t suggests, as genome editing technologies and applications develop, the need for ongoing public discussion about how regulatory bodies should draw distinctions between such things as ther apy and enhancement or disability and disease. There is considerable variation among countries, or even over time in the same country, with respect to the role of public opinion, world view , and religious affiliation in the formation of public policy. In theocracies, public policy with respect to embryo research, germline genome editing, and even somatic therapy may be shaped by explicit reference to re ligious doctrine. Even in formally secular countries, re ligious belief may strongly infl uence individual morality, which in turn is expressed in pers onal opinions and political prefer ences. Other countries may have constitutional requirements for various degrees of separation between government programs or policies and religious institutions. For this reas on, public engagement will be part of public policy formation in a variety of ways acro ss the globe (Pew Research Center, 2008). In the United States, regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have statutory authority to permit or prohibit the marketing of medical products based on technical considerations of risk and benefit. There is no auth ority to refuse approval for a particular product that is intended for (or mi ght be used for) a purpose that many view as immoral. If such a prohibition were to be enacted , it would emerge from the legislature, subject to limitation where the prohibition would abridge constitutionally protec ted rights. In matters such as these, public input is an impo rtant component of sound decision making. This chapter begins by delineating the broad c oncepts encompassed by public engagement. It then reviews in turn U.S. and international pub lic engagement practices. The chapter turns next Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT 127 PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION to lessons learned from past public engagement efforts. The final section presents conclusions and recommendations. PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT: BROAD CONCEPTS The broad concepts that guide public engage ment have been outlined nicely by Alan Leshner, CEO Emeritus of the American Asso ciation for the Advan cement of Science: We need to engage the public in a mo re open and honest bidirectional dialogue about science and technology and their pr oducts, including not only their benefits but also their limits, perils, and pitfal ls. We need to respect the public's perspective and concerns even when we do not fully share them, and we need to develop a partnership that can res pond to them. (Leshner, 2003, p. 977) In the same vein, an editorial in Nature calle d on scientists to participate in these public discussions and bring their ex pertise to the wider conversation, even when \"such public discussions may take many research ers outside their comfort zone\" ( Nature , 2017). In practice, public engagement takes many different forms, and it is beyond the scope of this report to discuss the advantages and disadvant ages of different modalities (NRC, 2008; Rowe and Frewer, 2005; Scheufele, 2011). Nonetheless, it is possible to articulate at least three broad principles of engagement that can be applied to guide any effort to broaden the discourse on human genome editing to include the maximum numb er of relevant viewpoints and stakeholders. The first principle of pub lic engagement relates to quality of outcomes . Previous National Academies reports have identified a host of factor s that contribute to high-quality regulatory or policy decisions informed by engagement effo rts (NASEM, 2016a; NRC, 1996, 2008). Four such factors are particularly noteworthy for enga gement efforts surrounding human-genome editing. First, is considering and weighing systematically the widest possibl e range of effects, as well as the uncertainties surrounding them. This includes consideration of risks and benefits that go beyond technical, medical, or scientific questio ns and encompass \"persp ectives and knowledge of [all] interested and affected parties\" (NRC, 1996, p. 3). Second, is identifying the full range of potential policy or regulatory options. Third, quality public engage ment mechanisms \"deal with both facts and values and in particular with how anticipated changes in the world will affect the things people value\" (NRC, 2008, p. 235). And finally, members of th e lay public are able to ask questions and suggest solutions that may not have been imagin ed by regulators or experts. A second principle of public engagement is the legitimacy of outcomes . Legitimacy tends to be connected to a number of re lated factors. First, proce sses for public engagement are transparent and perceived by all participants as fair and competent (Hadden, 1995). Second, echoing some of the considerations outlined earlier, public engagement identifies values, interests, and concerns of all interested or poten tially affected parties. Finally, engagement is pursued in a manner consistent with relevant laws and regulations. These first two engagement principles, howev er, need to be balanced with a third\u2014 administrative efficiency . \"The goal of full partic ipation needs to be cons idered in light of the need for administrative efficiency to ensure that decisions are made in a timely manner\" (NASEM, 2016c, p. 56), while also guarding agai nst the risk that we ll-resourced or well- organized constituencies will dominate the publ ic discourse and drown out other voices. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 128 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION Based on these broad principles, public engagement efforts typically are built around one or more of the following processes (Rowe and Frewer, 2005): Communication/information \u2014ensuring that decision-rele vant information (including ethical, regulatory, and political consider ations) effectively reaches maximum cross sections of society. In other words, public engagement ef forts\u2014regardless of format\u2014 need to focus not just on eas y-to-reach audiences (e.g., more educated segments of the population) or highly invest ed groups (e.g., patient advocacy groups, religious communities, groups concerned with wome n's rights/gender issues, environmental activists). Consultation \u2014conveying decision-relevant informa tion from the maximum number of relevant and affected public(s) to the sponsor s of the initiative (e.g., regulatory agencies, policy makers at the federal a nd potentially even state levels). The process of structuring and soliciting this consultation typically is initiated by the sponsor. One possibility for more efficient consultation is to interact w ith interest and advocacy groups. These groups can be a vehicle for reaching large number s of people who share a position or goal, although with the caveat that these groups vary widely in how democratically they arrive at their positions or how accurately they re flect the range of views of their members (Seifter, 2015). Participation \u2014exchanging all decision-relevant info rmation and value considerations among the maximum number of relevant publ ic(s) and policy actors. Dialogue and negotiation transform opinions and incr ease information and awareness among both sponsors and public participants . Many examples of participat ory activities are based at least partially on formal deliberations among (policy) decision makers and members of the public, along the lines of Danish consensus conferences (discussed further below) that provide formal input into policy-making processes (Danish Board of Technology, 2006, 2010a,b). Regardless of the process, the pur pose of engagement efforts is not to create or increase public acceptance of emerging technologies. In this sense, public engagement is a direct response to what is known as the \"knowledge defic it model\" (Brossard and Lewenstein, 2009)\u2014the notion that it is possible (or desirable) to increase public acceptance of new technologies by closing knowledge deficits and bui lding relevant scientific lite racy among nonexpert audiences. Public engagement models deviate from knowle dge deficit models in two ways. First, they acknowledge that very limited empirical data suppor t the assumption that more informed citizens will be more accepting of emerging technologi es (Scheufele, 2013). Second, such models abandon the notions (1) that buildi ng public support for science is, in all cases, desirable; and (2) that public debate or even controversy is al ways undesirable. Instea d, public engagement is designed to facilitate \"the sh aring and exchange of knowledge, perspectives, and preferences between or among groups who often have differen ces in expertise, power, and values\" (NASEM, 2016b, p. 22). As a result, it \"gives all stakeholders opportunities to discus s the potential risks, benefits, and consequences of a technology befo re it is developed or deployed; can motivate attention to issues important to the public good; and ideally encourages ci vic participation and expression of views by all the diverse groups th at are concerned with an issue\" (NASEM, 2016a, pp. 1-7). Copyright All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT 129 PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION Empirical evidence also is limited on how eff ective different models of public engagement are in achieving these goals, and the existing lite rature draws mainly on examples of engagement activities from the local and region al levels. As a result, it is di fficult either to point to specific structures or processes for effective engagement th at are applicable across contexts or to predict how they can be tailored to fit the wide diversity of participants, regulatory questions, and topics (NASEM, 2016a). U.S. PRACTICES Across different issues, countri es, and jurisdictions, efforts to translate the principles discussed above into practice have varied widely. In the United States, the Obama Administration codified the idea of public engagement under the label responsible development : \"Innovation with respect to emerging technolog ies\u2014such as nanotechnology, synthetic biology, and genetic engineering, among ot hers\u2014requires not only coordina ted research and development but also appropriate and balanced oversight\" (Holdren et al., 2011, p. 1). In practice, this concept involves communication and consultation , as described in the prev ious section, as two key processes: Communication : \"The Federal Government should ac tively communicate information to the public regarding the potenti al benefits and risks associ ated with new technologies\" (Holdren et al., 2011, p. 2). Consultation : \"To the extent feasible and subject to valid constraints (involving, for example, national security and confidential business information), relevant information should be developed with ample opportunitie s for stakeholder involvement and public participation. [This is] important for prom oting accountability, for improving decisions, for increasing trust, and for ensuring that officials have access to widely dispersed information\" (Holdren et al., 2011, p. 2). In the United States, Congress enacts laws govern ing science, health care, and the like, all of which are influenced by democratic processes th at bring public opinion and constituent interests to the attention of elected officials. Specialized agencies generally are empowered to implement law (subject in most cases to overall policy direct ion from the executive branch) through the use of regulations that are deve loped with public input. The nature and extent of this public engagement vary to some degree with the overseeing agency, but all agencies are governed by a set of legal rules that have been outlined in the Administrative Procedures Act and subsequently interpreted by the courts. The engagement techniques include advance notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunity to comment, and a requirement that the agency explain its rationa le for a rule and why it adopted or rejected comments. These formal rulemaking processes incl ude relatively straightforward rules regarding public engagement. Often in the case of a highly complex or ra pidly evolving area (such as biotechnology or life sciences), subregulatory, legally nonbinding gui dances or agency practices apply, some of which also are subject to formal public comment. Lastly, for new research such as genome editing, there can be additional nonbind ing review by the National Institutes of Health's (NIH's) Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) or by an expert advisory committee convened by the FDA.

All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 130 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION Public engagement in science po licy is a global affair. One example is the introduction of the concept of RRI, Responsible Research and I nnovation, by the European Commission in the Horizon 2020 funding program, to in crease stakeholder pa rticipation and influence in research directions. It is about \"co-creating the future with citizens and civil society organisations, and also bringing on board the widest possible divers ity of actors that would not normally interact with each other, on matters of science and technology\" (European Commission 2016a). It includes an effort to map the ethical issues re levant to innovation and, with the help of the public, to identify the best optio ns for governance, whether in formal law, or in voluntary standards and practices (Europ ean Commission, 2016b). It also includes the VOICES (Views, Opinions, and Ideas of Citizens in Europe on Science) project, with its thousands of participants in focus groups and other exer cises (European Commission, 2016c). Existing Infrastructure for Public In volvement in Genome Editing Policy In addition to the general framework for pub lic engagement in policy, there are some particularly relevant opportuni ties for public engagement in the current approval process for somatic gene therapy research. To the extent th at some policy can be formulated at the state level, as has happened in some states with respect to embryo research, cloning, and funding for stem cell research, the states themselves can be stakeholders that engage with the federal agencies (albeit with complex goals that include concerns about state power and independence) (Seifter, 2014b). In federalist systems, such as those not only of the Unite d States but also of Europe and Australia, it is im portant to include consideration of regional opportunities for public engagement and policy making as well. Beyond a llowing for the possibilit y that policy making may well occur at the local level, doing so has the potential to in crease the perceived legitimacy of centralized, federal polic ies adopted by administrative rule (Seifter, 2014a). At the federal level in the United States, opportun ities for public engagement exist but tend to be limited and passive, and not the type of fuller public engagement that may be appropriate for an important new technology such as human genome editing, especially as potentially applied to the germline. These opportunities are described below. National Institutes of Health's Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee At present, the RAC provides the greatest opport unity for public involvement in the oversight of human gene-transfer or genome-editing protocol s. Under the modified procedures enacted in April 2016, the RAC reviews only human gene-t ransfer protocols that present novel or significant scientific, societal , or ethical concerns. The RA C reviewed the first human CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing trial in the United Stat es pursuant to these criteria in June 2016. As described in greater detail in Chapter 2, the RAC's process is transparent and provides opportunities for public involvement. RAC meeti ngs are conducted in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which requires public advance notice of meetings that are open to the public (unless certain exceptions appl y) and where time is made available for public comment. In addition, recent RAC meetings have been webcast for viewing in real time or from the archives after the meeting, and NIH's O ffice of Biotechnology Activities has created an email list for individuals who wish to be info rmed of new RAC meetings and activities. Although these provisions allow for limited par ticipation by interested members of the public, they are passive in that th ey apply primarily to a subset of the public that has an existing interest and that seeks out the meeting information. In its current form, the RAC lacks scholarly Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Therefore, submissions are proprietary and not available for public review or comme nt. As noted earlier, however, the website ClinicalTrials.gov has now been amended to increas e public access to data about trials and their results and a product sponsor may elect to make some or all of the IND information publicly available. Furthermore, if a gene-therapy or genome-editing protocol is reviewed by an FDA scientific advisory committee, that meeting is open to the public, a nd a public representative must be included on the advisory committee ro ster. Once a biological license is approved, additional information is avai lable for public posting. Nonethel ess, overall the FDA review process lacks the transparency associated with an advisory body such as the RAC. The FDA periodically calls informational publ ic meetings, as it did for genetically engineered salmon (FDA, 2010), or hosts a more ge neral public discussion, such as that on how the regulatory system for bi otechnology products should be modernized (FDA, 2015c). The FDA's advisory committee meetings, as well as its more generalized meeting mechanisms, would be available for discussion of therapies that depend on genome editing, and they might be particularly useful for discu ssion of products aimed at or lik ely to be used off-label for \"enhancement.\" National Bioethics Commissions Many nations have bodies to pr ovide advice to their government s or to provide venues for public conversation and such en tities exist on every continen t except Antarctica. They are usually appointed by the executive or legislat ive branches, and offer analyses and policy recommendations on a range of topics in bi oethics. In November 1996, a group of national bioethics commissions met for a summit, at the i nvitation of the American \"National Bioethics Advisory Commission\" and the French \"Comit\u00e9 C onsultatif National d'Ethique pour les Sciences de la Vie et de la Sant\u00e9.\" 65 Since then, there have been a seri es of global summits of these bodies, the most recent in Germany and the ne xt to take place in 2018 in Senegal. Like many other countries, th e United States has a long tr adition of using bioethics commissions as a venue for both public particip ation and advice to the government on policy options (see Box 7-1). The tradition began in the 1970s with the cr eation of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subject s of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, whose work led to substantial ch anges in the management of clin ical trials. The U.S. federal government has assembled many subsequent commi ssions to address bioethical issues. Common features of these commissions include opportu nities for public testimony, open meetings, the availability of transcripts of commission discussions, and the ev ident effect of this public participation and observation on bot h the decisions made at the meetings and the implementation 65See http://www.who.i nt/ethics/partnerships /globalsummit/en (acce ssed January 30, of Sciences.

Under current U.S. regulations, an IRB must have at least one member \"who is not otherwise affiliated with the institution,\" and among the types of e xpertise its membership must represent is sensitivity to \"community attitudes.\"66 Likewise, an IBC must incl ude at least two members not affiliated with the institution that \"represent community attitudes.\" INTERNATIONAL PRACTICES As noted above, in Europe, many of the effo rts surrounding public engagement in science have been guided by the idea of responsible innovation , i.e., a \"transparent , interactive process by which societal actors and innovators become mutu ally responsive to each other with a view to the (ethical) acceptability, sustainabi lity and societal desirability of the innovation process and its marketable products\" (Schomberg, 2 012). This includes elements of information and consultation , as described above, but also a strong commitment to formal public participation in policy formation and decision making in many countries.

To some extent, however, the emphasis on consensus constrains their ability to present dissenting views (see Table 7-2). Although no count ry can fully satisfy all the objectives of public engagement in the realm of human germ line genome editing, one widely shared objective is to strive to \"enrich and expand the scope of traditional debate between experts, politicians, and interested parties by communicating citizens' vi ews and attitudes on cont roversial technologies\" (Scheufele, 2011). TABLE 7-2 Public Engagement in Denmark: Consensus Conferences Modalities Strengths Weaknesses These represent one of the earliest and most referenced of consensus conferences (late 1980s). A representative sample is recruited; around 2,000 randomly selected citizens are invited to apply. The Danish Board of Technology (DBoT, an independent body created by the Danish Parliament) then selects 14-16 panel members to participate in the conference. These citizens are introduced to and briefed on the topic(s) at hand by an expert journalist. They then meet for extensive discussion among themselves. Finally, they draft a report that expresses their stance on a The final report is taken seriously by the DBoT, which uses it to advise the Danish Parliament. Hence citizens' voices are fully integrated into the debating chambers of the government. This solicitation of input from selected Danish citizens prior to any form of legislative debate allows policy makers to identify ethical issues they may not even have considered, as well as gives them time to adjust policy proposals in light of the citizen report. This in turn increases citizens' levels of trust in government. Many academics, and The members of a citizen panel selected through such a top-down system can never truly be representative of the population at large. The careful monitoring of citizen panel members to minimize imbalances due to age, geographic location, gender, socioeconomic status, and cognitive and personality differences, as well as level of interest in the topic(s), tends to create an \"idealized\" group of people meant to represent the real world, when such is not the case. Hence, this highly selective procedure means that those selected already have a pronounced interest in the topic at hand. Thus inclusion of those Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The final citizen's report must be a consensus; hence no dissension is either allowed or included in the document. In designing public engagement activities, ther e are lessons to be learned from previous national efforts. These include th e need to avoid having a small or overly selective sample of citizens and viewpoints and having a structure that is overly cent ralized and controlled in a top- down fashion (a structure that may be difficult to avoid in large, centralized national systems). One way to address these potential pitfalls is to follow the UK approach of \"outsourcing\" many public engagement activities to independent and nongovernmental entitie s (Sciencewise, 2016; Wilsdon, 2015). However, independent data with whic h to evaluate the efficacy of these efforts in other countries and their applicability to the U.S. context are limited. Moreover, when the process involves formulating future public policy for a country at large, it may be advantageous to have a central organizer of these types of consultations. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES Public engagement efforts are crucially important for guiding societal and political debates about the social, ethical, legal, and political aspects of applica tions of human genome editing. Given the infrastructures already in place to enga ge the public, as well as the general principles for engagement discussed in this chapter, the comm ittee sees particular valu e in an approach that uses different processes for engagement for different types of que stions surrounding genome editing. At the same time, it is essential that all such e fforts adhere to all the principles for effective public engagement outlined earlier and that they apply two additional engagement principles to help avoid potential pitfalls. First, any effort to engage th e public broadly needs to distin guish between systematic public opinion research and public engagement exercises. The former uses social scientific methods to measure public opinion in ways that allow for generalization from representative samples to larger populations. Such efforts include quantifiabl e indicators of how likel y it is that certain characteristics observed in a sample occur in the general population (e.g., Dillman et al., 2014). Public opinion research is particularly useful fo r identifying informational needs, perceptions of risk and benefit, or other attitudinal variab les among different publics (Scheufele, 2010). By contrast, public engagement exercises such as consensus conferences or public meetings typically rely on representative s of highly interested and knowl edgeable groups that can help policy makers or the scientific community identify et hical, legal, or societ al considerations early in the policy-making process. The specific popul ations on which most engagement exercises draw and the social dynamics that drive c onversational settings\u2014eve n with professional moderators\u2014often limit the ability to generalize findings from such exercises to broader public opinion (Merkle, 1996; Scheufele, 2011). Parallel efforts with focus groups and broad public surveys of more randomly selected samples may be needed. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT 135 PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION A second important principle rela tes to communicating the specifi c types of science on which policy makers or other conveners of engagement exercises seek input. Human beings interpret new information by using existing frames of re ference (Goffman, 1974; Kahneman and Tversky, 1984). Fairly minor differences in how scientific techniques are describe d in meeting materials or the examples that are chosen for particular ap plications can significantly alter initial attitudes among participants, as well as the overall nature of discussions (A nderson et al., 2013). Thus it is important that written meeting materials or pr esentations by experts during public engagement exercises not be developed only by technical expert s based on their perceptions of relevance or appropriateness. Instead, they need to be systema tically pretested using em pirical social science to ensure that they minimize a priori biases a nd allow for inclusive, br oad discussions that are not constrained artificially to the technical or scientific aspects of the subject. MOVING FORWARD Current infrastructure in the Un ited States adequately includes public input for current modes of gene therapy, including both commercially and publicly funded basi c research involving human genome editing. As discussed earlier, scien ce in the United States is subject to well- functioning quality controls, oversight mechan isms, and ethical controls. Many of these mechanisms, such as IRBs, already involve public input. Similarly, the pu blic has a means of providing systematic input on funding priorities, re gulations, and other asp ects of basic research through electoral choices at the fe deral, state and local levels. Engagement mechanisms built into current regula tory infrastructures in the United States are sufficient address somatic applications of hu man genome-editing techniques, but this does not mean they cannot be improved. The engagement processes employed by groups such as the RAC are communication of relevant information and cons ultation with affected or interested parties. In rarer cases, efforts have also been undertaken to provide for true public participation in regulatory rulemaking. Ideally, all oversight bod ies involved in human genome editing would expand their portfolio of engagement efforts to develop more systematic and sustainable modes of public participation. In particular, an expansi on of current modes of public engagement will be necessary to help regulatory bodies define the definitions of and boundaries between such terms as therapy and enhancement or disease and disab ility. These efforts might be aided by regulatory agencies' adding members with relevant expertise to specific committees, such as FDA advisory committees that need to evaluate the benefits of an indication a nd the degree of unmet need for a new edited cell- or tissue-based product. For any consideration of applications of geno me editing of the human germline, extensive, inclusive, and meaningful public input consistent with the principles of engagement outlined in this chapter would be a n ecessary condition for moving forward. To this end, ongoing monitoring of public attitudes, information defic its, and emerging concerns would be essential. These public engagement efforts would allow agencies and other policy bodies to (1) communicate effectively by informing different p ublics and providing policy -relevant scientific information, and (2) identify areas requiring systematic efforts to cr eate infrastructures for public engagement early in the process (NASEM, 2016a). The complex issues surrounding enhancement will also require an ongoing public debate to inform regulators and policy makers about the indi vidual and societal values to be placed on the benefits and risks before clinical trials for su ch enhancement interventi ons could be authorized. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 136 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION These ongoing efforts to encourage public engageme nt would need to be tied directly to the policy-making process (NRC, 2008, p. 19). Furthe rmore, the complex issues surrounding enhancement will require ongoing public debate to inform regulators and policy makers about the individual and societal values to be placed on the benefits and risks before clinical trials for such interventions could be authorized. To facilitate and monitor the effectiveness of such engagement efforts, federal agencies would need to consider funding programs for res earch to (1) promote understanding of the long- and short-term sociopolitical, ethi cal, and legal aspects of human genome editing; (2) evaluate the efficacy of various efforts to build public engagement (communication, consultation, and participation) into regulator y or policy-making infrastructu res; and (3) assess how public engagement can and should influence different areas of policy making. Experiences with the genome initiative's program to include consideration of \"ethical, legal and so cial issues\" as part of its overall funding of scientif ic research, and expe riences with the Centers for Nanotechnology in Society funded by the National Science Founda tion might provide useful frameworks for structuring similar research agendas or f unding programs for public engagement for genome editing.67 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Efforts to advance human medicine through genome editing will be strengthened by public engagement informed by technical experts and by social scientists who undertake systematic public opinion research, develop appropriate comm unication materials, and minimize artificial biases or constraints that woul d hinder discussion and debate. Existing public communication and engagement infrastructures in the United States are sufficient to address oversight of basic sc ience and laboratory re search on human genome editing. Similarly, mechanisms for public communi cation and consultation that are part of the current U.S. regulatory infrastr uctures are also available to address public communication around development of human somatic-cell genome editing. Weighing the technical and societ al benefits and risks of appl ications of future uses of germline editing will require more formalized ef forts to solicit broad pub lic input and encourage public debate than are currently in place. Furthermore, the complex issues surrounding enhancement will require an ongoing public debate to inform regulators and policy makers about the individual and societal values to be placed on the benefits and risks before clinical trials for such enhancement interventi ons could be authorized. The practices and principles developed for effective and inclusive public engagement on other emerging areas of science and technology pr ovide a valuable base to inform public engagement on genome editing.

Basic laboratory research applyi ng genome-editing methods to human cells, tissues, germline cells and embryos has great promise for improving our understanding of normal human biology, including furthering our knowledge of hu man fertility, reproduction, and development, as well as providing deeper understanding of di sease and establishing new approaches to treatment. Such research is proceeding rapi dly within existing overs ight systems. Genome editing is already entering clinical testing fo r somatic treatment of certain genetic diseases, subject to regulatory systems designed to overs ee human somatic-cell gene-therapy research. Furthermore, recently developed methods offer the future possibility of editing germline cells to prevent heritable transmission of genetic disease, within the limits of domestic and transnational law. At the same time, genome-editing technolog ies challenge regulator s and the public to evaluate existing governance system s to determine whether there ar e genetic alterations that are insufficiently justified, too risky, or too socially disruptive to be pursued at this time. This chapter summarizes the conclusions of the committee relating overarching principles and specific conclusions to its r ecommendations for the conduct a nd oversight of this burgeoning area of research and applications. OVERARCHING PRINCIPLES FOR GOVERNANCE OF HUMAN GENOME EDITING Genome editing has great promise for preventi ng, ameliorating or eliminating many human diseases and conditions. Along with this promis e comes the need for ethically responsible research and clinical use. RECOMMENDATION 2-1. The following principles should undergird the oversight systems, the research on, a nd the clinical uses of human genome editing: Promoting well-being Transparency Due care Responsible science Respect for persons Fairness Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 140 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION Transnational cooperation In turn, these principles resu lt in a number of responsibilities when devising a governance system for genome editing: Promoting well-being: The principle of promoting well- being supports providing benefit and preventing harm to those affected, often referre d to in the bioethics literature as the principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence. Responsibilities that flow from adherence to th is principle include (1 ) pursuing applications of human genome editing that promote the health and well-being of individuals, such as treating or preventing disease, while minimizing risk to individuals in early a pplications with a high degree of uncertainty; and (2) ensuring a reas onable balance of risk and benefit for any application of human genome editing. Transparency: The principle of transparency require s openness and sharing of information in ways that are accessible and understandable to stakeholders. Responsibilities that flow from adherence to this principle include (1) a commitment to disclosure of information to the fullest ex tent possible and in a timely manner, and (2) meaningful public input into the policy-making pr ocess related to human genome editing, as well as other novel and disruptive technologies. Due care: The principle of due care for patients en rolled in research st udies or receiving clinical care requires proceeding carefull y and deliberately, and only when supported by sufficient and robust evidence. Responsibilities that flow from adherence to th is principle include pr oceeding cautiously and incrementally, under appropriate supervision and in ways that allow for frequent reassessment in light of future advances and cultural opinions. Responsible science: The principle of responsible sc ience underpins adherence to the highest standards of research, from bench to bedside, in a ccordance with in ternational and professional norms. Responsibilities that flow from adherence to this principle include a commitment to (1) high- quality experimental design and analysis, (2) appr opriate review and eval uation of protocols and resulting data, (3) transparency, and (4) correc tion of false or misleading data or analysis. Respect for persons: The principle of respect for pers ons requires recognition of the personal dignity of all indivi duals, acknowledgment of the cen trality of personal choice, and respect for individual decisions. All people have equal moral value, regardless of their genetic qualities. Responsibilities that flow from adherence to th is principle include (1 ) a commitment to the equal value of all individuals, (2) respect for and promotion of individual decision making, (3) a commitment to preventing recurrence of the abusiv e forms of eugenics practiced in the past, and (4) a commitment to destigmatizing disability. Fairness: The principle of fairness re quires that like cases be tr eated alike, and that risks and benefits be equitably distri buted (distributive justice). Responsibilities that flow from adherence to th is principle include (1 ) equitable distribution of the burdens and benefits of research and (2 ) broad and equitable acces s to the benefits of resulting clinical applicati ons of human genome editing.

All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance SUMMARY OF PRINCIPLES AND RECOMMENDATIONS 141 PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION Transnational cooperation: The principle of transnati onal cooperation supports a commitment to collaborative approaches to rese arch and governance while respecting different cultural contexts. Responsibilities that flow from adherence to this principle include (1) respect for differing national policies, (2) coordination of regulatory st andards and procedures whenever possible, and (3) transnational collaboration and data shar ing among different scientific communities and responsible regulatory authorities. These principles and responsibilities can be fulf illed in the form of specific recommendations for regulation of genome editing, as presented below. EXISTING U.S. OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS FOR HUMAN GENOME EDITING In the United States, existing laws and funding policies at the state a nd federal levels will govern human genome editing at all stages from laboratory research through preclinical testing and clinical trials to clinical application. The existing systems, while always having room for improvement, can be deployed to manage currentl y anticipated uses of human genome editing, but some future uses will require stri ngent criteria and further public debate. Laboratory Research Using Genome Editing Methods The use of genome editing as a laboratory resear ch tool in human soma tic cells and tissues would largely be governed in th e same way as other types of laboratory research, which are subject to institutional biosafety review and general standards of laboratory practice. Additional policies are also in place to govern the donation and use of human cells, tissues or embryos for research. These take account of factors such as wh ether the tissue is left over from a clinical procedure or is obtained through in tervention specifically for rese arch,. If tissue has information within or linked to it that makes the donor's id entity readily ascertainabl e, then additional human subjects protections such as the need for some form of consent and an institutional review board (IRB) review generally will also apply. Additional considerations apply to the use of genome editing for laboratory research using human embryos (with no aim of establishing a pr egnancy). In the United States, federal funding for research using embryos gene rally is prohibited by the Dickey-Wicker amendment, but some state and private sources for such research are ava ilable. Such uses would be subject to some of the legal regimes governing human reproduction and products of conception. Recommendations of the 1994 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Human Embryo Re search Panel, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medi cine's Guidelines for Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research, and the International Society for St em Cell Research guidelines continue to shape research practices in this area.. The ethical and regulatory considerations posed by genome editing research using human embryos in the laboratory have been explored in the past: the moral status of the embryo; the acceptability of making embryos for research or using embryos that would otherwise be discarded, and legal or voluntary limits that apply to the use of embryos in research. These same ethical considerations are raised in other countries. Even with re cognition of the scientific value of using human embryos in research, the practice is limited, discouraged or even prohibited in many jurisdictions.

All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 142 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION purposes will be subject to those same ethical norms and policies. Where permitted, however, oversight procedures already in place for ot her forms of embryo research should provide assurance of the necessity and quality of the research. Oversight of laboratory resear ch using human cells and tissues is an expression of the principle of Responsible Science , which includes high-quality experimental design and protocol review. Science proceeds by rigorous peer review and publication of results, and also benefits from sharing and access to data that can s upport continued development of the field. The principle of Transparency supports sharing information to the fullest extent possible consistent with applicable law. Respect for diversity am ong nations in domestic policy on research using human embryos should not be an obstacle to Transnational Cooperation , including data sharing, collaboration by regulatory authorities and, wh ere possible, harmonization of standards. Conclusions and Recommendation: Fundamental Laboratory Research Laboratory research involving human genome ed iting\u2014that is, research that does not involve contact with patients\u2014follows regulatory pathways that are the same as those for other basic laboratory in vitro research with human tissues, and raises issues alr eady managed under existing ethical norms and regulatory regimes. This includes not only work with somatic ce lls, but also the donation and use of human gametes and embryos for research purposes, wher e this research is permitted. While there are those who disagree with the policies embodied in some of those rules, the rules continue to be in effect. Important scientific and clinical issu es relevant to human fertility and reproduction require continued laboratory research on human gametes and their progenitors, human embryos and pluripotent stem cells. This research is neces sary for medical and scientific purposes that are not directed at heritable genome editing, though it will also provide valuable information and techniques that could be applied if heritable genome editing were to be attempted in the future. RECOMMENDATION 3-1. Existing regulat ory infrastructure and processes for reviewing and evaluating basic labo ratory genome-editing research with human cells and tissues should be used to evaluate future basic laboratory research on human genome editing. Somatic Cell Genome Editing for Treatment or Prevention of Disease and Disability The most immediate clinical applications of genome editing will be in human somatic cells for the treatment or prevention of disease and di sability. Indeed such re search is already in clinical trials. In the United States, clinical a pplications that use somatic cell genome editing fall under jurisdiction of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), wh ich regulates human tissue and cell-based therapies. Initiation of any genome-editing clinical trial requires prior approval by the FDA, and IRBs will also oversee aspects such as recruitment, counseling and adverse-event monitoring for trial participants. Regulatory assessments associated with clinical trials of somatic-cell genome editing will be si milar to those associated with other medical therapies, including minimization of risk, analysis of whether risk s to participants are reasonable in light of potential benefits, and whether particip ants are recruited and en rolled with appropriate voluntary and informed consent. Additional oversi ght in the United States includes local safety reviews by institutional biosafety committees an d national-level review opportunities under the Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance SUMMARY OF PRINCIPLES AND RECOMMENDATIONS 143 PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION auspices of the NIH Recombinant DNA Adviso ry Committee (RAC), for both specific, novel protocols and for general approaches. The ethical norms and regulatory regimes alread y developed for other forms of gene therapy are adequate for managing new applications involving somatic genome editing with the purpose of treating or preventing diseas e and disability. But regulatory oversight should also emphasize prevention of unauthorized or premat ure applications of genome editing. In some circumstances, it may also be desira ble to consider undertaking genome editing in the somatic cells of a fetus in utero, for example where fetal editing could be significantly more effective than post-natal intervention for genetic diseases with devast ating effects early in development. The potential benefit to the resu lting child would be ke y. But in utero genome editing would also require special attention to issues surroundi ng consent and to any increased risk of on-target or off-target modifications to fetal germ cells or germ cell progenitors. Recommendations for regulating somatic cell genome editing are informed by several of the overarching principles. An importa nt goal in both the research a nd clinical uses of somatic genome editing is Promoting Well-being . Transparency and Responsible Science are necessary for advancing the research with confid ence in the quality of the work, while Due Care ensures that the applications proceed incr ementally with careful attention to risks and benefits, as well as reassessments that allow timely response to chan ging scientific and clinical information. As therapeutic and preven tive medical technol ogies are developed, Fairness and Respect for Persons call for attention to equitable access to the benefits of these advances, protection of individual choice to pursue or de cline use of these therapies, and respect for the dignity of all persons regardless of that choice. Conclusions and Recommendations: Somatic Therapy In general, there is substantial public support for the use of gene therapy (and by extension, gene therapy that uses genome editing) for the treat ment and prevention of disease and disability. Human genome editing in somatic cells holds gr eat promise for treati ng or preventing many diseases and for improving the safety, effectiven ess, and efficiency of existing gene therapy techniques now in use or in clinical trials. While genome-editing techniques continue to be optimized, however, they are best suited only to tr eatment or prevention of disease and disability and not to other less pressing purposes. The ethical norms and regulatory regimes alread y developed for gene therapy can be applied for these applications. Regulatory assessments asso ciated with clinical trials of somatic cell genome editing will be similar to those associated with other medical therapies, encompassing minimization of risk, analysis of whether risks to participants are reasonable in light of potential benefits, and determining whether participants are recruited and enrolled with appropriate voluntary and informed consent. Regulatory oversi ght also will need to include legal authority and enforcement capacity to prevent unauthorized or premature applications of genome editing, and regulatory authorities will ne ed to continually update their knowledge of specific technical aspects of the technologies being applied. At a minimum, their assessments will need to consider not only the technical context of the genome-editing system but also the proposed clinical application so that anticipated ri sks and benefits can be weighed. Because off-target events will vary with the platform technology, cell type, ta rget genome sequence, and other factors, no single standard for somatic genome-editing specif icity (e.g., acceptable off-target event rate) can be set at this time.

Existing regulat ory infrastructure and processes for reviewing and evaluating somatic gene therapy to treat or prevent disease and disability should be used to eval uate somatic gene therapy that uses genome editing. RECOMMENDATION 4-2. At this time, regulatory authorities should authorize clinical trials or approve ce ll therapies only for indications related to the treatment or prevention of disease or disability. RECOMMENDATION 4-3. Oversight authorit ies should evaluate the safety and efficacy of proposed human somati c cell genome-editing applications in the context of the risks and benefits of intended use, recognizing that off- target events may vary with the pla tform technology, cell type, target genomic location, and other factors. RECOMMENDATION 4-4. Transparent and inclusive public policy debates should precede any consideration of whet her to authorize clinical trials of somatic cell genome editing for indi cations that go beyond treatment or prevention of diseas e or disability. Heritable Genome Editing Genome editing that creates genetic changes heritable by future generations (heritable germline editing) has the potential to alleviat e the suffering caused by genetically inherited diseases. However, it also raises concerns that extend beyond considera tion of individual risks and benefits. Although human germline genome editi ng would not currently be approvable given the uncertainty about safety and efficacy, the technology is advancing rapidly, and heritable germline editing may, in the not-so-distant future , become a realistic possibility that needs serious consideration. There are circumstances in which genome editing in germline cells or embryos might be the only or most acceptable opti on for prospective parents who wish to have a genetically related child while mi nimizing the risk of transmitting a serious disease or disability. There is a history of debate around the possibil ity of making heritable changes to the human genome. Because the effects of such changes could be multi-generational, both the potential benefits and the potential harms could be multiplie d. Benefits from such editing would accrue to any future child born with reduced burden from genetically inherited disease, and to the prospective parents seeking to ha ve a genetically rela ted child without fear of passing along a disease.. On the other hand, concerns have been raised about the wisdom and appropriateness of this form of human intervention. The intended ge nome edits themselves might have unintended consequences which, if inherited, would also a ffect descendants. As with other forms of advanced medical technologies, questions of equa lity of access arise. The prospect of heritable germline editing also triggers concerns simila r to those earlier raised by preimplantation and prenatal genetic screening, i.e., that purely vo luntary, individual deci sions might collectively change social norms about the acceptance of disabilities. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance SUMMARY OF PRINCIPLES AND RECOMMENDATIONS 145 PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION Conclusions and Recommendations: Editing In some situations heritable germline editi ng would provide the only or the most acceptable option for parents who desire to have genetically related children while minimizing the risk of serious disease or disability in a prospective chil d. Yet while relief from inherited diseases could accrue from its use, there is significant public discomfort about germline genome editing, particularly for less serious conditions and for si tuations in which alte rnatives exist. These concerns range from a view that it is inappr opriate for humans to intervene in their own evolution to anxiety about uninte nded consequences for the indivi duals affected and for society as a whole. More research is needed be fore any germline intervention could meet the risk/benefit standard for authorizing clinical trials. But as the technical hurdles facing genome editing of progenitors of eggs and sperm are overcome, editing to prevent transm ission of genetically inherited diseases may become a realistic possibility. The primary U.S. entity with authority for the regulation of germline genome editing\u2014the FDA\u2014does incorporate value judgm ents about risks and benefits in its decision making. A robust public discussion about the values to be placed on the benefits and risks of heritable germline editing is needed now so that these valu es can be incorporated as appropriate into the risk/benefit assessments that will precede any decision about whether to authorize clinical trials. But the FDA does not have a statutory mandate to consider public views about the intrinsic morality of a technology when deciding whether to authorize clinical trials. That level of discussion takes place at the RAC, in legislat ures and at other venue s for public engagement, discussed in Chapter 7. Heritable germline genome editing trials must be approached with caution, but caution does not mean they must be prohibited. If the technical challenges are overcome and pot ential benefits are reasonable in light of the risks, clinical trials could be initiated, if limited to only the most compelling circumstances, are subject to a comprehensive oversight framework that would protect the research subjects and their descendants; and have suffi cient safeguards to protect agai nst inappropriate expansion to uses that are less compelling or less well understood.

Clinical trials using heritable germline genome editing should be permitted only wi thin a robust and effective regulatory framework that encompasses the absence of reasonable alternatives; restriction to preventing a serious disease or condition; restriction to editing genes that ha ve been convincingly demonstrated to cause or to strongly predispo se to that disease or condition; restriction to converting such genes to versions that are prevalent in the population and are known to be associated with ordinary health with little or no eviden ce of adverse effects; the availability of credible pre-clinical and/or clinical data on risks and potential health benefits of the procedures; during the trial, ongoing, rigorous oversight of the effects of the procedure on the health and safety of the research participants; Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Given how long modifying the germline has be en at the center of debates about moral boundaries, as well as the pluralism of values in society, it would be surprising if everyone were to agree with this recommendation. Even for thos e who do agree, it would be surprising if they all shared identical reasoning for doing so. There are also those who think the final criterion of Recommendation 5-1 cannot be met, and th at once germline modification had begun, the regulatory mechanisms instituted could not lim it the technology to the uses identified in the recommendation. If, indeed, it is not possible to satisfy the criteria in the recommendation, the committee's view is that germline genome editing would not be permissible. The committee calls for continued public engagement and input wh ile the basic science evolves and regulatory safeguards are developed to satisf y the criteria set forth here. Heritable germline genome editing also raises co ncerns about premature or unproven uses of the technology, and it is possible that the criteria outlined here for responsible oversight would be achievable in some but not all jurisdictions . This possibility rais es the concern that \"regulatory havens\" could emerge that would tempt providers or consumers to travel to jurisdictions with more lenient or nonexistent regulations to unde rgo the restricted procedures. The phenomenon of medical tourism, which enco mpasses the search for faster and cheaper therapeutic options, as well as ne wer or less regulated interventions , will be impossible to control completely if the technical capabilities exist in more permissive jurisdictions. Thus, it is important to highlight the need for comprehensive regulation. As of late 2015, the United States is unable to consider whether to begin germline genome editing trials, regardless of whether the criteria laid out above could be met. A provision (in effect until at least April 2017) was passed in a budget bill,68 in which Congress included the following language: None of the funds made av ailable by this Act may be used to notify a sponsor or otherwise acknowledge receipt of a submission for an exemption for investigational use of a drug or biological product under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ( 21 U.S.C. 355(i)) or section 351(a)(3) of the Public Health Serv ice Act (42 U.S.C. 262(a)(3)) in research in which a human embryo is intentionally created or modified to include a heritable genetic modification. Any such submission shall be deemed to have not been received by the Secretary, and the ex emption may not go into effect. 68Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 , HR 2029, 114 Cong., 1st sess. (January 114hr2029enr.pdf [accessed January 4, 2017]). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance SUMMARY OF PRINCIPLES AND RECOMMENDATIONS 147 PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION The current effect of this provision is to make it impossible for U.S. authorities to review proposals for clinical trials of germline genome editing, and therefore to drive development of this technology to other jurisdictions, some regulated and others not. Genome Editing for Purposes Othe r Than Treating or Preventing Disease or Disability Both the ongoing development of therapeutic uses of somatic genom e editing, and possible future development of therapeutic uses of ge rmline genome editing, raise the issue of defining disease and disability, and th e question of how and where to set appropriate boundaries for treatment and prevention of these conditions. Li ke other technologies, human genome editing methods may be applied for a wider range of purposes, including to enhance human capacities beyond the normal range. It is diffi cult to define the concept of enhancement. The lines between what are considered therapy, prevention, and enha ncement are not rigid or easily discernible in all cases, and even the definition of what is considered a \"disease\" can be open to debate. For this reason, distinguishing between treating or pr eventing disease and disability on the one hand, and a notion of enhancement on the other, is ch allenging. Possible uses of genome editing thus fall along a continuum of acceptability. Addre ssing serious genetic disorders by converting causative genetic variants to non-deleterious vari ants generally fall at the most acceptable end of this spectrum, while editing to produce enhancem ents unrelated to disease typically fall at the least acceptable end. The report draws a distinc tion between genome editing for the purpose of treating or preventing disease or disability and genome editing for purposes other than treating or preventing disease or disability, w ithout concluding that there is, as yet, any general consensus as to how to define the blurry boundari es of enhancement more clearly. Editing to create a genetic enhancement could, in principle, be undertaken in the context of somatic-cell genome editing or in the context of heritable germline editing. As with other potential applications of genome editing, individual risks and benefits would be associated with the assessment of such editing. But the possibility of genetic enhancemen t raises a number of additional ethical and so cial concerns, for which easy answer s are not available and differences of opinion are likely. Conclusions and Recommendations: Genome Ed iting for Purposes Other Than Treatment or Prevention of Disease Significant scientific progress will be necessary before any genome-editing intervention for indications other than the treatment or preven tion of disease or disa bility can satisfy the risk/benefit standards for initiating a clinical tr ial. This conclusion hol ds for both somatic and heritable germline interventions. There is signifi cant public discomfort with the use of genome editing for so-called \"enhancement\" of human traits and capacities beyond those typical of adequate health. Therefore, a robust public disc ussion is needed concer ning the values to be placed upon the individual and societal benefits and risks of genome editing for purposes other than treatment or prevention of disease or disability. These discussions would include consideration of the potential for introducing or exacerbating societal ineq uities, so that these values can be incorporated as appropriate into the risk/benefit assessments that will precede any decision about whether to authorize clinical trials.

All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 148 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION RECOMMENDATION 6-1. Regulatory agenc ies should not at this time authorize clinical trials of somatic or germline genome editing for purposes other than treatment or preventi on of disease or disability. RECOMMENDATION 6-2. Government bo dies should encourage public discussion and policy debate regarding governance of somatic human genome editing for purposes other than t reatment or prevention of disease or disability. The Role of Public Engagement in G overnance of Human Genome Editing Efforts to advance human medicine through genome editing will be strengthened by public engagement, and this engagement will be particular ly critical for the potential uses that are not captured effectively by current regulatory fram eworks. In the United States in particular, regulatory authority tends to focus primarily on h ealth and safety of individuals and the public, and not on issues surrounding possible effects on so cial mores and culture. These latter concerns are regularly addressed in other fora, such as advisory committees, but lack legal force unless reflected in legislation that is grounded in the limited powers granted to government. Other countries have systems that more explicitly acco unt for public attitudes in deciding whether and how to permit new technologies to be developed, with widely vary ing degrees of legal constraint on governmental authority. Conclusions and Recommendations: Public Engagement Efforts to advance human medicine through genome editing will be strengthened by public engagement informed by technical experts and by social scientists who undertake systematic public opinion research, develop appropriate comm unication materials, and minimize artificial biases or constraints that woul d hinder discussion and debate. Existing public communication and engagement infrastructures in the United States are sufficient to address oversight of basic sc ience and laboratory re search on human genome editing. Similarly, mechanisms for public communi cation and consultation that are part of the current U.S. regulatory infrastr uctures are also available to address public communication around development of human somatic-cell genome editing. Weighing the technical and societ al benefits and risks of appl ications of future uses of germline editing will require more formalized ef forts to solicit broad pub lic input and encourage public debate than are currently in place. Furthermore, the complex issues surrounding enhancement will require an ongoing public debate to inform regulators and policy makers about the individual and societal values to be placed on the benefits and risks before clinical trials for such enhancement interventi ons could be authorized. The practices and principles developed for effective and inclusive public engagement on other emerging areas of science and technology pr ovide a valuable base to inform public engagement on genome editing. RECOMMENDATION 7-1. Extensive and inclusive public participation should precede clinical trials for an y extension of human genome editing beyond treatment or prevention of disease or disability. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance SUMMARY OF PRINCIPLES AND RECOMMENDATIONS 149 PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION RECOMMENDATION 7-2. Ongoing reasse ssment of both health and societal benefits and risks, with broad ongoing participation and input by the public, should precede consideration of any clinical trials of heritable germline genome editing. RECOMMENDATION 7-3. Public participat ion should be incorporated into the policy-making process for human genome editing and should include ongoing monitoring of public attitudes, informational deficits, and emerging concerns about issues surrounding \"enhancement.\" RECOMMENDATION 7-4. When funding human genome-editing research, federal agencies should consider incl uding funding to support near-term research and strategies for identifying areas that require system atic and early efforts to solicit public participation, developing the necessary content a nd communicating it effectively, and improving public engagement with in the context of existing infrastructure. RECOMMENDATION 7-5. When funding human genome-editing research, federal agencies should consider incl uding funding for research aimed at understanding the sociopolitical, ethical, and legal aspects of editing the human germline; understanding the sociopolitical, ethical, and legal aspects of uses for genome editing that go beyond treatme nt or prevention of disease or disability; and evaluating the efficacy of effort s to build public communication and engagement on these issues into regulatory or policy-making infrastructures.

Although an effort has been made to maximize the accessibility of this material, a simpler summar y of this material can be found in Chapters 3 and 4. This appendix includes detaile d material on the following topics: breakage and repair of DNA precursors of the Clustered Regularly Inters persed Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) system/CRISPR-associated endonuclease activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) development of CRISPR/Cas9 the accuracy of gene editing enhancing the specifici ty of CRISPR/Cas9 quality control and quality assurance for gene editing use of dead Cas9 (dCas9) to regulate transc ription or to make epigenetic modifications gene targeting in transgenic animals gene editing in embryos alternative routes to heritable germline editing editing the mitochondrial genome GENE THERAPY AND GENOME EDITING The potential for gene therapy to address human disease has been evident for some years, and much progress has been made in its applications (Cox et al., 2015; Naldini, 2015). Gene therapy refers to the replacement of faulty genes, or th e addition of new genes as a means to cure disease or improve the ability to fight di sease. Genome editing is one asp ect of gene therapy. Established approaches to gene therapy have been based on th e results of extensive prior laboratory research on individual cells and on nonhuman organisms, es tablishing the means to add, delete, or modify genes in living organisms. Key advances include the development of techniques for generating molecular tools for cutting the DNA of genomes in specific places to allow targeted alterations in the DNA sequence. Over recent years, several such methods have been introduced and used effectively in clinical applications. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 174 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION Within the past 5 years, a completely novel sy stem has been developed based on fundamental research on bacterial systems of immunity to vi ral infections. The first such system to be developed for use in genome editing of huma n cells, known as CRISPR/Cas9, is based on RNA- guided targeting and is much simpler, faster , and cheaper than earlie r methods. The ease of design, together with the remarkable specificity and efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system has revolutionized the field of genome editing and reignited interest in the potential for editing of the human genome. The development of the CRISPR/Cas9 system as a programmable genome-editing tool was built on a firm foundation of earlier research. BREAKAGE AND REPAIR OF GENOMIC DNA Genomes and their constituent genes are ma de of double-stranded DNA; this DNA can be broken accidentally (e.g., by radiation) or purpos efully, using proteins called endonucleases (often called nucleases) that can genera te double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA. Cells have mechanisms to repair DSBs in DNA, and these mechanisms can be used to generate alterations in the DNA sequence. Gr oundbreaking work in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian systems shows that DSBs dramatical ly stimulate the rate of DNA repair by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), in which the br oken ends are reattached (see Figure A-1). Such NHEJ repair often results in the deletion or insertion of DNA sequences of varying length, which can disrupt gene function (Rouet et al., 1994). However, if a homologous stretch of DNA is introduced into the cell as a donor template, homology-directed repair (HDR) can lead to more accurate repair or, if specific alterations are included in the homologous stretch, it can introdu ce specific precise chan ges into the recipient genomic DNA (see Figure A-1). These cellular DNA repair mechanisms have been used to develop several methods that allo w genes or the genome to be edit ed in a very precise manner.

All three have already enabled major advances in establishing the feasib ility of using such targeted nucleases both to eliminate disease-causing genes as well as to repair damaged or mutated genes, ushering in a new era in biology and medicine.

Knowledge gained from natural zinc fingers led to the development of ZFNs as designer DNA-cutting enzymes (see Figure A-2), a nd their use in genome engineering represents pioneering, even heroic, protein engineering. Two major advances in protein engineering enabled the development of ZFNs: (1) the engineering of zinc finge r proteins wi th designed DNA- binding specificity pioneered by Berg (Desjarl ais and Berg, 1992), Pabo (Rebar and Pabo, 1994), and Wells (Jamieson et al., 1994); and (2) the gene ration of fusions between such designer zinc fingers and a DNA-cleaving protein, FokI nucle ase (Kim et al., 1996), yielding \"artificial restriction enzymes\" that could be used to pr omote site-specific genome engineering by creating DSBs at defined locations in the genome (Bibikova et al., 2001, 2002, 2003). Using these findings, Sangamo Therapeutics de veloped ZFNs from laboratory tools into therapeutic agents that could be used to disa ble disease-causing genes (by NHEJ) or to correct errors in existing genes (by HDR). The latter goal is particularly challengi ng, as the efficiency of HDR is usually much lower than the imprecise and mutagenic repair by NHEJ. By overcoming some of these difficult challenges, Sangamo now has several ongoing human clinical trials,69 the most advanced of which is in the treatmen t of HIV/AIDS where deletion of the CCR5 HIV coreceptor has the potential to enable th e elimination of HIV following bone-marrow transplantation. Other applic ations of ZFNs have also been, or are being, tested in clinical trials (NCT02695160 [hemophilia B] and composed a DNA-bi nding protein that recognizes particular DNA sequences fused to a nuclease effector domai n to achieve the cleavage (Joung and Sander, 2013) (see Figure A-2). TALEs are secreted bacterial proteins with DNA-binding domains that contain a series of conserved blocks of seque nce 32-34 residues long, each with two divergent amino acids. These divergent amino acids are largely responsible for determining the DNA- binding specificity for a singl e DNA base pair, which allows engineering of specific DNA- binding domains by choosing combinations of re peat segments contai ning appropriate amino acids. The biotech firm Cellectis reported the su ccessful conduct of the first-ever TALEN-based gene-editing clinical trial in the United Kingdo m on a girl with incura ble acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Qasim et al, 2017). Although the applications of ZFNs and TALENs are largely overlapping, TALENS have the advantage of relative ease of design because of the robust recognition code. Meganucleases Meganucleases are nucleases with very long DNA-binding recognition sites, up to 40 nucleotides (Silva et al., 2011) (s ee Figure A-2). As a result of their length, it is exceedingly unlikely that natural sites would be present by chance even in complex human genomes. The challenge with meganucleases is the difficulty in designing new nucleases to target a sequence of interest at will. Some success has been achie ved by designed changes to DNA-binding sites and combining meganucleases with TALE January 7, 2017). Academy of Sciences.

DEVELOPMENT OF CRISPR/CAS9 CRISPR as a Bacterial Adap tive Immunity System The discovery that CRISPR systems provide ad aptive immunity to bacteria represents a major conceptual advance in its own right. This di scovery was also critical to the development of CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering. A brief synopsis of the key findings is provided below (for a more complete review, see D oudna and Charpentier, 2014). CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspersed S hort Palindromic Repeats) loci were first identified based on analyses of bacterial genomes . From these studies, it was inferred that the spacer (i.e., non-repetitive) regi ons of CRISPR loci were deri ved from the genomic DNA of bacteriophages (viruses that in fect bacteria) leading to the hypothesi s that CRISPR provided a defense mechanism against foreign genetic elemen ts (Makarova et al., 2006; Mojica et al., 2005; Pourcel et al., 2005). The key experimental br eakthrough came from re search showing that CRISPR allowed bacteria to acquire resistance to bacteriophages by integrating segments of the bacteriophage genome into the CRISPR loci, de monstrating that CRISPR was a new form of adaptive immunity (Barrangou et al., 2007). In 2010, type II CRISPR/Cas systems were shown to mediate cleavage of invading bacteriophage DNA (Garneau et al., 2010). And in 2011, an associated RNA, tracrRNA, was identified (Del tcheva et al., 2011) a nd the CRISPR-associated gene, Cas9, was shown to be the only protein-co ding gene in the type II Cas locus required for the defense function (Sapranauskas et al., 2011). Development of Cas9 as a Programmable Endonuclease The critical advance in the development of the CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-editing method came in 2012 from the laboratories of Doudna a nd Charpentier. They established that the CRISPR-associated protein Cas9, in complex with two small RNAs, CRISPR RNA (crRNA) (tracr RNA), yields site- specific endonuclease in which the site of cleavage is defined by base pairing of crRNA to the target DNA. This laid the groundwork for establis hing that Cas9 is an endonuclease that can be programmed with a single \"guide RNA\" (gRNA, a chimera of crRNA transcribed from the locus and the tracrRNA) to cleave at sp ecific DNA sites (Jinek et al., 2012) (see Figure A-3a). Concurrent with the Jinek et al. (2012) manuscript, Siksnys and coworkers (Gasiunas et al., 2012) demonstrated that purified complexe s containing Cas9 and a crRNA could mediate cleavage of double-stranded DNA in vitro at sites complementary to the crRNA. While this was clearly an important advance, a key missing element was the identi fication of the requirement for the tracrRNA to form an active endonuclease. The Jinek et al. (2012) paper made the key break through of the use of a single chimeric guide RNA that can fulfill the role of both the crRNA and tracrRNA (see Figure A-3a). Thus, mechanistically, the is supe rior to both ZFNs and TALENs in terms of ease of use; all that is required to generate a site-specific nucleas e is design and synthesis of a single guide RNA (gRNA) to targ et the Cas9 nuclease to the de sired site of editing.

Additionally, ther e was a seventh paper (Qi et al., 2013) showing that catalytically dead dCas9 coul d be used to inhibit transcription. Since that time there has been an explosion in the application and refinement of Cas9-mediated cleavage, as well as the discovery of novel CRISPR systems that can be adapted for genome editing. These include the discovery of a novel RNA-guided endonuclease, Cp f1 (Zetsche et al., 2015), and more recent work has shown that further CRISPR-targetabl e nucleases with the potential for differing capabilities are being discovered. ACCURACY OF GENE EDITING The potential impact of unintended changes to DNA is a key challenge for safe use of genome editing as a therapeutic strategy. Unintended changes to the genome could be caused by cleaving DNA at sites other than those th at are being delibe rately targeted. The Challenge of Off-Target Toxicity The site at which Cas9 cleaves DNA is dete rmined by the complementarity of the DNA target with the RNA guide (typi cally 20 base pairs) adjacent to a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence (e.g., NGG for Streptococcus pyogenes , the most commonly used species of Cas9). In principle, this 22-base sequence woul d give enough diversity su ch that the cut site should be unique within even a 3 billion base-pair human genom e. In practice, however, some base mismatches are tolerated l eading to significant potential fo r off-target cutting. This has motivated efforts both to monitor the sites of off-target cutting as well as to enhance the specificity of the targeted nucleases. Initial effort s to define off-target cutting of Cas9 focused on specific searches for cutting at ne ar-cognate sites. More recently these have been complemented by less biased genome-wide efforts. These can be divided into two broad cl asses: cell-based en conducted at a single-cell level, would seem to provide a definitive assessment of the accuracy of Cas9 genome editing. However, the depth of sequencing that would be required to certify the absen ce of off-target cutting is currently difficult to achieve for populations of ce lls. It should be possibl e, however, to estimate the sensitivity of the system fo r detecting off-target editing. Fa ilure to detect editing with the assay would then indicate that the off-target editing rate was below the detection level. Integrase-defective lentiviral vector (IDLV) capture (see Figure A-4a) is a genome-wide approach used to evaluate the specificity of geno me-editing nucleases that was initially applied to engineered ZFNs and then later applied to TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 (Gabriel et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2015). This method is based on the captu re by NHEJ of IDLVs, which have linear double- stranded DNA genomes, into sites of nuclease- induced DSBs. Although the IDLV capture method directly identifies DSBs that occur in living cel ls, it is relatively in sensitive and has a high background. To overcome these limitations, genome-w ide unbiased identification of DSBs enabled by sequencing (GUIDE-seq) (see Figure A-4b) wa s developed (Tsai et al., 2015). GUIDE-seq Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

High-throughput genome-wide identifies Cas9 off-targ et cleavage in live cells (Chiarle et al., 2011). HTGTS is based on the detection of translocatio ns between a nuclease-induced \"bait\" DSB and is that nuclease-induced tr anslocations represent rare events and thus require larg e numbers of input genomes for de tection. A strategy for detecting genome-wide nuclease-induced DSBs in fixe d cells, termed \"BLESS\" for breaks labeling, enrichment on streptavidin, and ne xt-generation sequencing, captures a snapshot of transient DSBs that are present at a moment in time in a population of cells by direct in situ ligation of biotinylated hairpin adaptors in fixed and perm eabilized Figure A-4d). Genome-Wide in In Vitro Assays Digenome-seq (see Figure A-4e) is an in vitro method for detection of nuclease-induced DSBs in genomic DNA using whole-genome se quencing of Cas9-cleaved genomic DNA. Genomic DNA is isolated, and treated with high concentrations of Cas9/guide RNA in vitro to maximize off-target cleavage and cleavage site s are identified by DNA se quencing. Because this assay is performed in vitro on purified DNA, it is not limited by cell-based factors such as chromatin context, epigenetic factors, subnuclear localization, or fitness effects. Digenome-seq thus may detect potential additional off-target cl eavage at sites that w ould otherwise be obscured in cell-based methods. Thus, it could yield an ov erestimate of off-target events in vivo. ENHANCING SPECIFICITY OF CRISPR/CAS9 Given its ease of use, flexibility, and ve rsatility, the CRISPR/Cas9 system is rapidly becoming the tool of choice for gene editing. Ho wever, concerns about the potential risk of unwanted off-target effects have dominated many recent discussions. Most experiments that have detected significant off-targets have been perf ormed in cancer cells (Fu et al., 2013; Hsu et al., 2013), which may have altered DNA repair pathways that could lead to elevated off-target events. In contrast, experiments in whole organisms such as mi ce (Yang et al., 2013), primates (Niu et al., 2014), zebrafi sh (Auer et al., 2014), or Caenorhabditis elegans (Dickinson et al., 2013) reported off-target frequencies that were lo w or not detectable, co nsistent with the high specificity of the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene ta rgeting. It is possible that, in non-transformed cells, off-target cleavages are efficiently counter-selected by the endogenous DNA-damage response. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) ar e primary cells with genetically intact quality control mechanisms, and it seems possible that off- target events will accumulate less frequently in hPSCs or in normal somatic cells than has be en observed in cancer cells. Nevertheless, it will be important to determine whethe r there are specific cell-types and conditions that predispose for the accumulation of off-target events. To addre ss concerns about off-target events, diverse approaches to minimize mistargeting are being developed. Based on progress already made, it is anticipated that the risk of off-target events may be dramatica lly reduced, if not eliminated, in the near future for many genome-editing approach es. Below are three approaches and related progress. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Based on studies of CRISPR/Cas9 structure, two recent papers report engineered substitutions su ch that the resulting Cas9 pr otein has a significantly reduced off-target rate (Kleinstiver et al., 2016; Slaymaker et al., 2016). The two studies focused on different DNA-binding domains of Cas9 but took the common strategy of reducing the relative affinity for nonspecific DNA binding. Remarkably th is enhanced the specif icity of Cas9 cutting without obviously impairing its overall efficiency . While these attempts are encouraging, other strategies will undoubtedly be forthcoming and should further improve the process, based on knowledge of CRISPR/Cas9 structur e (Haurwitz et al., al., 2013; Wiede nheft et al., 2009, 2011). Engineered Combinations of Cas9 with Modified Cleavage Sites This approach involves the use of two target ed DNA cuts, ensuring better fidelity than a single target cut. The basic rati onale is that Cas9 protein has two active DNA-cleaving sites, involving aspartic acid, D10, and histidine, H840, each responsible for cutting a single strand of DNA thus generating the DSB (Jinek et al., 2014). Ba sed on this feature, there are two ways of inactivating Cas9: single inactiv ation and double inactivation (Gu ilinger et al., 2014; Ran et al., 2013; Tsai et al., 2014). In one approach, Cas9 with a single inactivation, also named Cas9 nickase (Cas9n), in which, only one of the active s ite residues (D10 or H840) is replaced with alanine (A), yields a Cas9 protein capable of cutting one strand of double-stranded DNA. Consequently, providing two guide RNAs that direct cutting on oppos ite strands in close proximity mediated by a dimer of Cas9n single cutte rs leads to an effective DSB and stimulation of both NHEJ and HDR to yield a DSB (see Fi gure A-3b). Remarkably these nicks can be effective even as far apart as ~100bp. In a sec ond approach, both cleavage sites of Cas9 are inactivated, yielding nuclease-deficient \"dead\" which is fused to the FokI cleavage domain. As with ZF Ns and TALENs, two Cas9 mo nomers provide recognition specificity for FokI dimerization and DNA cleavag e (see Figure A-3c). In addition, these two strategies require appropriate length spacers betw een the targets: if the spacers are too short, there will be two competing Cas9 proteins, and if the spacers are too long, it is more difficult to execute effective cutting. Because of these stringent requirements, the off-target rate is greatly reduced, albeit with increased difficulty in target selection. These strategies have been shown to significantly reduce off-target ra tes (Guilinger et al., 2014; Ran et al., 2013; Tsai et al., 2014). Cas9 Base-Editor: Genome Editing Without Double-Stranded DNA Breaks In an effort to increase the efficiency and precision of making point mutations in genomic DNA, the Liu group recently developed the so called \"base editor\" variant of Cas9 (see Figure A-5), which consists of a highly engineered fusi on protein that recruits a cytosine deaminase domain which converts cytosine to uracil, thereby effecting an irreversible C T substitution (or GA by targeting the complementary strand) without double-stranded cleavage of the DNA backbone (Komor et al., 2016).

The \"base editor\" variant of Cas 9 pr ovides increased efficiency and precision when making changes to genomic DNA. SOURCE: Komor et al., 2016. Because cytosine deaminase acts only on single-stranded DNA, the C to U conversion activity is targeted to a sma ll window of ~5 nucleotides near the 5' end of the guide RNA- specified protospacer sequence on the disp laced DNA strand. double-stranded breaks, exogenous DNA templates, and stochastic DNA-repair processes, base editing introduces point mutations in unmodified mammalian cells w ith an efficiency as high as 75 percent and with a ratio of point mutati on correction:indels exceeding 20:1. Moving forward it will be important to develop alternate base-editors capable of media ting a wider range of genetic changes ideally ultimately allowing conversion of any base to any other base within a user- defined window. Additionally, it will be important to robustly evaluate the propensity of the cytosine deaminase domain to introduce muta tions outside of the DNA region targeted by the Cas9 guide RNA. An alternative strategy for improving HDR, term ed \"CORRECT,\" (consecutive re-guide or re-Cas steps to erase CRISPR/Cas-blocked target s), exploits the observation that HDR accuracy is increased dramatically by in corporating silent CRISPR/Cas-blo cking mutations along with the desired functional mutations (Pa quet et al., 2016). This prevents recleavag e and potential NHEJ repair that might disrupt su ccessful HDR products. The author s show that by controlling the location of the introduced point mutation relativ e to the Cas9-mediated double-stranded break they can alter the efficiency of mutagenesis, generating eith er heterozygous or homozygous alterations in human-induced plur ipotent stem cells (hiPSCs). QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY AS SURANCE FOR GENE EDITING The specificity of genome editing is even more important in clinical applications than in laboratory research. As a medical product or me dical practice, genome editing must be safe, efficacious, and cost-effective.

As discussed above, although technical advances will likely make off-target ev ents a manageable issue, this consideration will remain a concern that must be addressed by qua lity control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) procedures. In somatic genome editing, it may be rela tively easy to set up assa ys or procedures to address off-target changes but it is probable that such rate s will vary among cell types, necessitating measurement of off- target events in each cell type targeted. Although the specifics may vary from case to case, the general principle of monitoring to ensure safety and efficacy should be implemented. In contrast , it would be quite difficult to monitor embryos if they were to undergo editing. Functional equivalence assays need to be developed and agreed upon to serve as quality control measures. Alternatives may be considered, such as editing performed on sperm progenitor cells. USE OF DCAS9 TO REGULATE TRANSCR IPTION OR TO MAKE EPIGENETIC MODIFICATIONS An alternate strategy for genome editing involves the use of catalytically dead variants of Cas9 (dCas9). This yields a programmable DNA- binding protein that is incapable of generating either single- or double-stranded br eaks and thus does not typically lead to any changes in the DNA sequence of the genome. However, by fusing di fferent effector domains to dCas9, it can be used either to turn on (CRISPRa) (Gilbert et al., 2014; Konermann et al ., 2015; Perez-Pinera et al., 2013) or turn off (CRISPRi) tr anscription (Gilbert et al., 2013; Qi et al., 2013) or to make locus-specific changes to the epigenetic marks (modi fications of the chromatin that regulate gene expression). It is likely that most if not all such epigenetic chan ges would fail to be passed to subsequent generations thus alleviating some of the concerns surrounding germline-editing approaches. By the same token, the transient natu re of these changes limits their utility for correcting diseases caused by genetic mutations . Possible uses for such transient germline engineering, however, include the ability to expa nd germ cells, or the in vitro generation of desired stem cells or terminally differentiated cells. Additiona lly, the transient nature of the changes could expand the number of genes that coul d be safely targeted. For example, transient down-regulation of the HIV CCR5 coreceptor could pr otect against vertical passage of HIV, and this strategy could be expanded to other viral receptors. Additi onally, it is possible to imagine that transient alterations to gene expression co uld lead to permanent developmental changes in an embryo, which could ameliorate the effects of disease-causing inheri ted mutations. Because no permanent, heritable changes are made to th e individual, the use of dCas9 to alter gene expression does alleviate some et hical concerns. Nonetheless, at present the potential uses of dCas9 on embryos seem rather limited compared to approaches involving germline editing, and the more immediate therapeutic a pplications of dCas9 likely invol ve somatic alteration in gene expression. GENOME TARGETING IN TRANSGENIC ANIMALS Gene mutations can lead to abnormal developm ent and to disease. Over the past several decades, a major advance in studying the consequence of mutations has been the development of the ability to experimentally in troduce designed, targeted mutations into genes of organisms such as mice, fruit flies, and zebrafish, thus providi ng an important tool to understand the molecular-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

These methods can also be used to correct defective genes. Before describing th e application of current precise genome-editing methods, we will summarize the major steps that we re initially developed to genetically modify animals. Random Insertion of Foreign DNA The genetic manipulation of animals has been th e basis for much of the research aimed at understanding embryonic development and human di seases. One powerful technology is based on manipulating mouse embryos in vitro and transferring the embryos to a foster mother to produce genetically altered animals (see Figure A-6). Using these techniques, initially SV40 DNA (Jaenisch and Mintz, 1974) and later retroviruses (Jaenisch, 1976) were introduced into early m ouse embryos leading to the generation of the first transgenic mice that transmitted the foreign DNA to the next generation according to Mendelian expectations. The most widely used method to generate genetically modified animals was microinjection of DNA into fertilized mouse or Drosophila eggs leading to the production of a large number of transgenic mice or flies that carried foreign DNA in their germline (Brinster et al., 1981; Costantini a and Ruddle, 1981; Rubin and Spradling, 1982). The random integration of foreign DNA into th e genome of an animal can cause disruption of an endogenous gene leading to its inactivation. In th is \"insertional mutagenesis\" approach the integrated DNA is used as a molecular tag for the isolation and identification of the mutated gene. The collagen I gene was the first endogenous gene inactivated by retroviral insertional mutagenesis resulting in mutant mice whose phenot ype resembled brittle b one disease (Schnieke et al., 1983), a major disease of the skeletal system caused by mutations in a collagen gene. Similarly, injection of DNA into the zygote pr onucleus produced mutant mice by insertional mutagenesis (Mahon et al., 1988). In addition to insertional mutage nesis, the integration of a gene into the genome can result in transcriptio nal activation of nearby genes, which has been widely used to study the consequences of ect opic transgene expression (Hammer et al., 1984). FIGURE A-6 The generation of transgenic mice with randomly inserted transgenes. Embryos at the 4 to 8 cell stage are infected with retroviruses or DNA is in jected into the male pronucleus of the zygote. The embryos are incubated until they reach the blastocyst stage (~100 cells) and are transplanted into a foster mother. The exogenous DNA sequences are randomly integrated into the genome of the resulting transgenic mice. While integration into the genome leading to insertional mutagenesis or ectopic transgene expression is efficient in generating transgenic animals, the approach suffers from Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 186 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION unpredictability because the insert ion of DNA into the genome is random and does not allow the targeting of predetermined genes or predictable transgene expression. Gene Targeting in Embryonic Stem Cells Embryonic stem (ES) cells, initially isolated from mouse blastocysts, are able to differentiate into all cell types of the body (Evans and Kaufman, 1981; Mart in, 1981). Of great interest was that ES cells, when injected into a mouse carrier blastocyst, could integr ate into the developing embryo and contribute to all somatic tissues a nd generate \"chimeric mice.\" Of particular importance was the fact that the cells were able to contribute to the germline, thus allowing the derivation of animals from the cultured cells. Th us, the approach allowed the generation of mice carrying the alteration of an endogenous gene as a result of in vitro manipulation of the ES cells. The first mouse strain derived from an ES ce ll carrying a mutation in a predetermined gene was a strain with inactivation of the HPRT gene , which is mutated in human patients with the severe mental disorder Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. The isolation of HPRT mutant ES cells was straightforward using a culture medium (HAT) th at kills normal cells and selects for cells carrying an inactivated HPRT gene (Kuehn et al., 1987). This sele ctive approach, while successful for HPRT, cannot be used for editing other genes. Homologous Recombination The discovery of homologous recombination re presented a major breakthrough as it allowed the editing of any gene (Doetschman et al., 1987; Thomas and Capecchi, 1987). Targeting of genes requires the generation of a targeti ng vector containing DNA segments homologous to sequences of the endogenous gene flanking the de sired modification (see Fi gure A-1). The vector is transfected into ES cells, and correctly target ed clones are selected (s ee Figure A-7a). Cells carrying the desired modification ar e injected into mouse blastocysts to generate chimeric mice (see Figure A-7b), which are br ed with normal mice to obtain offspring carrying the mutant allele (see Figure A-7c). Homol ogous recombination in combinati on with ES cells has allowed scientists to efficiently create mice transmitting specific gene mutations to the next generation. Following the initial generation of mice carrying targeted mutations of the 2-microglubulin and the c-abl gene (Schwartzberg et al., 1989; Zijlstra et al., 1989), homologous recombination in ES cells has become a widely used tool for the study of mammalian development and the generation of animal models of human genetic diseases (S olter, 2006). Because chim era-competent ES cells were only available in the murine system, gene editing by homologous recombination was restricted to mice and could not read ily be used in other species. Nuclear Cloning and the Genera tion of Mutant Animals The transfer of a somatic nucleus into an enucleated egg resets the epigenetic state of the nucleus to an embryonic state and allows the ge neration of animals such as Dolly, the first cloned mammal (Wakayama et al., 1998; Wilmut et al., 1997). The production of animals from somatic cells by nuclear cloning allowed the gene ration of mutant animals in species where no ES cells were available. The first successful a pplication of nuclear clon ing in combination with homologous recombination to produce gene-altere d farm animals used sheep fibroblasts. The human 1-antitrypsin gene was inserted into the 3' UTR of the COL1A1 gene , a convenient \"safe harbor\" locus giving predictable expression of the transgene.

The strategies to produce animals carrying engi neered gene alterations as summarized above relied on the manipulation of ES cells or on nuclear cloning, both of which are labor-intensive and require special skills. This changed dram atically when the new genome-editing methods based on ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPR/Cas9 becam e available (Doudna and Charpentier, 2014). These approaches, described above, revolutionized th e ability of researcher s to edit genes in any species and to produce genetically altered animal s with a fraction of the effort and time and much less sophistication and experime ntal skills needed than were required for the generation of gene-edited animals by strategies base d on ES cells or nuclear transfer. FIGURE A-7 The generation of defined geneti cally altered mice by homologous recombination (three- step process). (a) In the first step a targeting vector with homolog y to the target gene is introduced into ES cells and correctly targeted clones are selected in culture. (b) The targeted ES cells are injected into an albino host blastocyst, which is transplanted into a foster mo ther to produce chimeric mice where the donor ES cells contribute to the tissues of the animal (as seen by co at color contribution derived from the ES cells). (c) Germline transmission of the ES cell clone is verified by mating of the chimeric mouse with the albino host strain. Pigmented offspring are derived from the donor ES cells.

In a second step the targeted ES cell clone is injected into a host blastocyst to create a chimeric animal, which, in a third step, is mated to produce the desired mutant animal, a process that may take as much as one or two years (compare Figure A-7). In contrast, gene targeting by TALEN or by CRISPR/Cas9 is so efficient that no selection for correct targeti ng is required (Sakuma a nd Woltjen, 2014), making it possible to derive genetically modified animals in one step by direct genetic manipulation of the fertilized egg (see Figure A-8). FIGURE A-8 The generation of gene-edited mice by CRI SPR/Cas9 targeting in the zygote (one-step process). Cas9 RNA and guide RNA (gRNA) targeting a ge ne of interest are injected into the cytoplasm of the zygote. Mice carrying a mutation in both alleles of the targeted gene are derived in one step at a high frequency. If co-injected with a DNA vect or, exogenous sequences will be inserted at some frequency at the double-strand break. CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Gene Editing in the Zygote The injection of guide RNAs together with Ca s9 RNA into the fertilized egg (zygote) was used to generate mice carrying mutations in se veral genes. The efficiency of Cas9-mediated DNA double-strand breaks was high and resulted in 80 percent of pups carrying mutations in both alleles of two different ge nes (Wang et al., 2013). When the guide and Cas9 RNAs were co- injected with an oligonucleotide carrying a point mutation, the mutation was introduced into two target genes in 60 percent of the pups. In addition, the generation of conditional mutants requiring the insertion of two LoxP sites into the same allele was shown to be effective in the zygote. Thus, NHEJ-mediated mutation as well as insertion of DNA at the double-strand break site is extremely efficient, allowing the genera tion of mice carrying comp lex mutations within 3 weeks (the gestation time of the mouse) instead of 1 to 2 years when using ES cell-mediated gene targeting. The CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing me thod was shown not only to work efficiently in mice but also in other species including rats (Li et al., 2013), zebrafish (Hwang et al., 2013), C. elegans (Friedland et al., 2013), and Drosophila (Zeng et al., 2015). Importantly, the approach allowed the generation of primates carrying mutati ons in specific genes (Niu et al., 2014). Most recently, two reports appeared that used genome editing in preimplantation human embryos that were defective and therefore could not be used to generate pregnancy (K ang et al., 2016; Liang et al., 2015). The evidence summarized above indicates th at animals carrying de fined mutations in multiple genes can be generated in one step by manipulation of the fertilized egg. However, if intended for gene therapy (correct ion of mutant genes), several si gnificant complications need to be considered. These include frequent mosaicis m of manipulated embryos , the mutation of both alleles when the goal is to correct one mutant allele and the impossibil ity of genotyping the one- cell embryo.

Animals with genetic alterations in only a su bset of the cells are de signated as \"mosaics.\" The available evidence indicates that the incidenc e of mosaicism may be as high as 50 percent or higher (Wang et al., 2013). The high inciden ce of mosaicism has an important practical consequence: Preimplantation genetic diagnos is (PGD)\u2014the biopsy of a single cell of the manipulated embryo\u2014cannot be used to ascertain wh ether gene targeting resulted in the desired mutation because a single cell may not reflect th e genotype of the other cells of the embryo. Mutation of the Wild-Type Alle le by Cas9-Mediated Cleavage Cleavage by Cas9 is significantly more e fficient than insertion of a donor DNA at the cleavage site by homologous recombination. This poses a complication if the goal of gene editing in embryos is the correct ion of a mutant allele. To corre ct a given mutation, a guide RNA and a DNA target construct are injected into th e embryo. While the DNA w ill integrate into the mutant allele at the double-strand break and corr ect the mutation, the other allele will often be cleaved, creating a new mutati on by NHEJ. Given present tec hnology, this poses a possibly serious problem for gene therapy as the mutant a llele is corrected, but a new mutant allele is created. The inhibition of repair by end joining us ing a small molecule may help to mitigate this problem as this has been shown to favor th e insertion of DNA by HDR over that by NHEJ (Maruyama et al., 2015). However, the unwanted mu tation of the normal alle le currently remains a complication of CRISPR/Cas9 -mediated gene correction. Genotyping of the One-Cell Embryo Genome editing in embryos with the goal being to correct a mutant allele faces another problem: how to distinguish a wild type from a mutant embryo. If one parent carries a dominant mutant gene, 50 percent of the embryos will be aff ected and 50 percent will be wild type, and if both parents carry a recessive mutation, 75 percen t of the embryos will be normal and 25 percent will be affected. Because it is not possible to use any current molecular test to distinguish mutant from normal embryos at the zygote stage, any gene-editing attempt will target (and modify) a large fraction of normal embryos. It is unlikely th at a technological advance could resolve this dilemma in the foreseeable future. GENE DRIVE: A MECHANISM TO SPRE AD GENETIC ALTERATIONS THROUGH SEXUALLY REPRODUCING POPULATIONS It has been proposed that naturally occurri ng \"homing endonucleases\" could cause mutant alleles to spread rapidly thr ough sexually reproducing populations by a process designated as \"gene drive\" (Burt, 2003, 2014). The spreading of such a mutant allele through a population does not require a selective advantage for the carrier of the mutant gene but would rather propagate like a \"selfish gene\" (Esvelt et al., 2014; Oye et al., 2014). Recently, a vector encoding both Cas9 a nd a guide RNA was introduced into a Drosophila Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 190 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION genomic locus color, creat ing a knock-out mutation. Cas9-mediated cleavage during development of the germline stimulated th e copying of the insertio n into the wild-type locus, such that all female gametes carried th e insertion (see Figure A-9). Importantly, when these eggs were fertilized the mutation in the resulting heterozygous anim als converted the wild- type allele into a mutant allele during meiosis by Cas9-mediated target gene cleavage, followed by HDR resulting in a homozygous mutation. Thus, the vector carrying the Cas9 gene and a guide RNA, when integrated into one allele, led to the convers ion of the other allele during meiosis with an efficiency of 98 percent, causi ng the rapid spread of th e mutant allele through the population (Gantz and Bier, 2015). This auto catalytic process was dubbed as a \"mutagenic chain reaction.\" If a vector carrying sequences correcting a gi ven mutation in addition to the Cas9 and the guide RNA was inserted into one allele, thes e sequences could serve as a template during meiosis and convert the other allele by homologous recombina tion resulting in two repaired alleles (see Figure A-9a). Similarl y, if a vector carrying sequence s coding for another gene in addition to the Cas9 and the guide RNA were inte grated into the other allele, leading to homozygous transgenic animals (Esvelt et al., 2014). Thus, gene-drive mechanisms can effectively propagate and spread mutant alleles or newly inserted genes through animal populations (see Figure A-9b). So far gene-drive constructs have been dem onstrated to spread through insect populations and have been proposed for use in mosquito populat ion control. Gene drives have not as yet been shown to behave similarly in mammalian speci es. However, given the efficiency of genome editing in mammalian embryos it is possible, if not likely, that the underlying gene-drive mechanisms would also be effective in ma mmals and could in principle create gene modifications that could spread through the population. However, given the generation time and breeding patterns of humans, any such gene-d rive application in the human species would require an inordinate numbers of years and seems inconceivable. ALTERNATIVE ROUTES TO HERITABLE GERMLINE EDITING The efficiency and precision of CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing approaches have raised the potential that precise genome editing might be possible in cell s that could contribute to the germline of the human species. For a genetic alteration to be passe d on to the next generation, it has to be made in (1) progenitor cells that can give rise to the gametes (eggs and sperm) , (2) the eggs and sperm themselves, or (3) in the fertilized zygote or early embryo , when all cells can still contribute to the future germline.

As discussed in the preceding section, methods for germline ed iting have been most highly developed in the mouse and applied to a number of other mammalian species, particularly in relation to agricultural needs or the generation of preclinical disease models for human genetic diseases. Until the recent advent of advanced geno me-editing tools, germline gene alterations in mice were primarily achieved via non-targeted introduction of transgenic DNA into the genome of the zygote or by targeted mutagenesis in ES cells. The latter approach involved the homologous recombination of targeting vectors into the host genome, the selection of the correctly targeted clones, and the generation of germline-transmitting chimeric animals (see details in the above section on germline genetic al teration). While this approach has proven to be Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 192 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION extraordinarily powerful in producing knock-out mice, conditional mutations, reporter lines, and a variety of human disease models, it is still relatively inefficient and has not been readily applicable to direct targeted genome alterations in zygotes. Thus , the idea of pot ential targeted gene alterations or corrections in huma n embryos was not under consideration. However, more recently, the efficiency of CRISPR/Cas in targeting nuclease-enhanced editing to specific sites in th e genome has raised new vistas including possible human germline editing. Soon after the demonstration that CRISPR/Ca s could very efficiently target specific sites in the genome of mammalian cells, it was shown that this approach could be applied directly to the mouse zygote without the need for the interm ediate ES cell step (see above section and Figure A-8). Thus, it became possible to consid er genome editing directly in human embryos. The only publications to date on testing CRISPR on human zygotes demonstrated that targeted mutations could be generated, but also demonstr ated that the resulting mutations were often complex and that only some embryos or embryonic cells carried the target ed event (Kang et al., 2016; Liang et al., 2015). As explained above, thes e intrinsic issues of CRISPR editing make the concept of using zygote genome editing to corre ct human genetic disease very challenging. Editing the embryo genome, however, is not th e only potential way to achieve modification of the genome in the germline. Approaches that directly modify the genome of the gametes\u2014the eggs and sperm\u2014before fertilization woul d overcome problems of mosaicism and would potentially allow preselection of th e appropriately targeted gamete before in vitro fertilization. Gamete Gene Editing: Current Status There are a number of potential routes to gamete gene editing, some of which are already in use in the mouse and some of whic h remain to be fully developed. Direct Introduction of Editing Factors into Oocytes In the mouse it has been shown that materna lly inherited Cas9 nuclease provides a very efficient means of generating targeted alterations in the resulting zygotes (Sakurai et al., 2016), presumably because of the immediate availability of the enzyme. While such an approach is, of course, not applicable to huma ns, it does suggest that preloa ding ovulated oocytes with the editing factors prior to in vitro fertilization might be a means of avoiding mosaic editing and enhancing efficiency. Whether th is could actually promote gene targeting in the oocyte genome rather than after fertilization remains to be repo rted. Preselection of muta ted or corrected oocytes would still be a challenge, but the reduction in mosaicism would allow PGD to be contemplated for identifying correctly targeted embryos. Gene Editing in Sperm In Vitro Sperm-mediated gene transfer is a fairly we ll established, although in efficient, route to transgenesis in a number of species , from fish to pigs (Lavitrano et al., 2013). Thus, it should be possible to introduce the components of genome -editing systems into sperm and have them carried into the zygote to promote genome editing there. More interesting is the possibility of direct genome editing in the sperm nuclei. Give n that sperm are non-dividing cells, currently only NHEJ-mediated gene editing would be pos sible, although the repair mechanism is presumably different from that in soma tic cells (Ahmed et al., 2010). Homologous recombination-mediated gene corr ection or alteration has to date only been possible in dividing cells. However, there are indications that this block can be overcome (Orthwein et al., 2015). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

HITI al lows the direct knock-in of DNA sequences at specific genomic loci in post-m itotic cells, for example, neurons (Suzuki et al., 2016b). HITI may open up new avenues to sper m (and even oocyte) gene editing. Insertion of a transient fluorescent reporte r to identify sperm carrying the ed iting factors could help enrich for potentially gene-edited sperm. Final confir mation of the appropriate ly edited embryos after fertilization in vitro or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) would require PGD. Gene Editing in Germline Stem Cells There is considerable biological and clinical interest in generating gametes from stem cell lines that can be propagated inde finitely in vitro. Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) have been isolated from mouse testes and have the capacity to regenerate fertilization-competent sperm when retransplanted to the germ cell -depleted adult testis (Kan atsu-Shinohara and Shinohara, 2013). Gene editing in SSCs would allow for the preselection of clonal li nes with appropriate targeted mutations and the poten tial to prescreen for off-targ et effects or other unwanted genomic or epigenomic alterations before genera ting gametes. Proof of principle for such an approach has been published (Wu et al., 2015), in which the authors corrected a gene mutation that causes cataracts in mice by CRISPR/Cas9 edi ting in SSCs. SSCs were transferred back to the testis and round spermatids colle cted for ICSI. Offspring were correctly edited at 100 percent efficiency. Translating this work into humans has many challenges. While SSC-like cells have been isolated from human testes (Wu et al., 2015), st able, self-renewing cell lines have not yet been achieved. If this challenge is overcome, there still remains the challenge of generating ICSI- competent gametes from the SSCs. In the mouse, this is achieved by transfer into the germ cell - depleted testis\u2014not an easy solution in human s. Alternate approaches include generating a \"reconstituted testis\" w ith mixed SSCs and supporting cells of the testis and tr ansplanting this under the testis capsule. This approach would also be ethically challenging in humans. The possible use of interspecies r econstitutions and transplants in to immune-deficient mice would bring its own scientific and ethical challenges. The best solution would be to promote differentiation of the SSCs to mature haploid game tes in a fully defined culture system in vitro\u2014 a challenge not yet achieved in any system. While the possibility of applying similar approach es to the female germline is attractive, the evidence for the existence of oogonial stem cells is controversial (Johns on et al., 2004). Most evidence suggests that there is a limited res ource of oocytes in the adult mammalian ovary (Eggan et al., 2006) and no eviden ce for any endogenous stem cells. Gene Editing in Pluripotent Stem Cells Followed by Germ Cell Differentiation Pluripotent embryonic stem cells or induced pl uripotent stem cells can be generated from both males and females, are readily amenable to CRISPR editing, and can be differentiated down the pathway toward meiotically competent germ cells . In the mouse, the most reliable reports of germ cell generation from ES cells have come from mimicking the known pathways that induce primordial germ cells from the pluripotent epib last in the early embr yo. Using this approach, Saitou's lab has generated primordial germ cell -like cells (PGC-LCs) from both male and female ES cells. When PGC-LCs were reconstitute d with support cells from the testis or ovary respectively and transplanted back to the testis or ovary environment, inve stigators were able to recover spermatids or oocytes that could be used to generate viable offspring when combined Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 194 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION with normal eggs and sperm (Hayashi et al., 2011, 2012). Most recently the Zhou lab has taken this approach one step further and reports that coculture of the PGC-LCs with testis cells in culture over a 2-week peri od allowed the isolation of spermatid- like cells that were capable of fertilizing oocytes after ICSI and generating viable offspring (Zhou et al., 2016). There are some concerns about whether epigenetic reprogramming would be complete in this culture system, but the overall result is quite remarkable. Another interesting development is from the Izpisua Belmonte, Okuda, and Matsui groups, who ha ve shown that knockdown or knock-out of Max in mouse ESCs strongly activates expression of germ cell -related genes and results in profound cytological changes to resemble cells undergoing meiotic division (M aeda et al., 2013; Suzuki et al., 2016a). Whether functional haploi d cells can be generated using this approach remains to be seen. These results in murine systems raise expect ations that human haploid gametes could be generated from human pluripoten t cells, with implications fo r understanding gametogenesis, causes of infertility and potentially offering new avenues for reproduction in infertile couples. It also would open up genetic modification of the stem cells to repair known genetic causes of infertility or to repair dominant gene mutations. However, to date, human gametes have not been generated successfully from pluripotent stem cells, although two recent papers report the generation of early PGC-LCs from human ES cells (Irie et al., 2015; Sasaki et al., 2015). Those studies revealed similarities a nd differences from the mouse germ-cell differentiation pathway. This suggests that more knowledge of how germ cells actually develop in the human, or perhaps the nonhuman primate, embryo versus the mouse embryo is needed to move this research forward. Gene Editing in Haploid ES Cells Most animals are diploids, and natural haploi d cells are typically limited to mature germ cells. Recently both androgenetic (male) and parthenogenetic (female) haploid ES cells (haESCs) have been derived in mice and ra ts (Leeb and Wutz, 2011; Li et al., 2012, 2014; Yang et al., 2012). haESCs contain only one copy of allelic genes of diploid cells and are amenable to genetic modification with traditio nal gene-targeting approaches and with new nuclease-based genome-editing strategies (Li et al., 2012, 2014). More interestingly, androgenetic haESCs, which contain a Y rather than an X chromosome, can produce viable and fertile offspring after intracytoplasmic inj ection into mature oocytes (Li et al., 2012, 2014). Haploid parthenogenetic mouse haES Cs were also shown to be able to produce fertile mice when injected into oocytes in place of the maternal genome (Wan et al., 2013). Both strategies are possible to be used for introduction of ge netic modifications to progeny. Most recently parthenogenetic human haESCs have also been successfully generated (Sagi et al., 2016). Human androgenetic haESCs have not yet been reported. There are several limitations of haESCs. First, the haploid phenotype has been found to be unstable in culture. haESCs undergo spontaneous auto-diploidization and need several rounds of haploid purification by flow-activated cell so rting before becoming stable in culture. Also, there is a lack of androgenetic haESCs containing the Y chromo some (Li et al., 2012). This is due to the poor developmental potential of androgenetic embryos with YY chromosomes (Latham et al., 2000; Tarkowki, 1977). Therefore onl y female animals can currently be created. With further breeding, males can then be obt ained. Another major dr awback is that the efficiency for androgenetic haESCs to fertilize an egg is very low (less than 5 percent in mice and less than 2 percent in rats).

All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance APPENDIX A 195 PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION In summary, although the generation of human \"art ificial\" gametes from stem cell lines is not currently achievable, work in the mouse suggests that this will likely be possible. Reconstituting the testis or ovary environment in vitro ma y be achieved by deriving both germ cells and supporting cells, such as Sertoli cells, and cumulu s cells from in vitro differentiation of human ES cells. Further understanding of the endogenous signaling pathways that promote germ-cell development and meiotic maturation will aid in the future derivation of human gametes in vitro. Such cells will be immediately useful for unde rstanding gametogenesis and dissecting fertility problems, but safety concerns will need to be overcome before they could be used for human reproduction, with or without genome editing. Th e germline is generally considered to be somewhat protected from genetic damage, unlik e that of somatic cells, and also undergoes extensive epigenetic remodeling before completio n of gametogenesis. Both aspects would need to be replicated in the artifici al gametes generated in vitro. EDITING THE MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME Mitochondrial diseases are a group of maladies caused by th e dysfunction of mitochondria due to mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Mitochondrial diseases are associated with the degeneration of tissu es and organs that have high en ergetic demands\u2014including muscle, heart, and brain\u2014that Turnbull, 2005). The percentage of mtDNA molecu les that is mutated generally determines whether or not a patient is symptomatic. Curren tly, there are no cures fo r mitochondrial diseases, and for patients healthy enough to have children, geneti c counseling and PGD represent the best options for preventing disease transmission. Howe ver, due to the non-Mendelian inheritance of mtDNA and the potentially different heteroplasmy levels among different blastomeres, PGD can only reduce, not eliminate, the risk of transm itting the disease. Recently developed mitochondrial replacement techniques involve a series of complex technical manipulations of nuclear genome between patient and donor oocytes that results in the generati on of embryos carrying genetic material from three different origins (Paull et al., 2012; Tachibana et al., 2012). For these reasons, mitochondrial replacement techniques have raised biological, medical, and ethical concerns (Hayden, 2013; Reinhard t et al., 2013). Mitochondrial replacement techniques have low rates of success, and studies in lower organi sms have reported potential issues arising from incompatibility between nuclear and mtDNA upon mitochondrial replacement (Reinhardt et al., 2013). A novel alternative therapeutic approach was recently developed to eliminate the mutated mtDNA in the germline. Using mitochondria-targe ted endonuclease, the targeted mtDNA in the mouse germline was successfully prevented from transmission to the next generation (Reddy et al., 2015). Due to the limited number of mtDNA muta tions that can be ta rgeted by restriction endonucleases, efforts have been made to target most of the mtDNA mutations using mitochondria-targeted Gammage et al., 2014). The mito-TALENs were able to specifically eliminate the targeted mtDNA in the mouse ge rmline (Reddy et al., 2015). Importantly, the technique of injection of nucleas es (e.g., mito-TALENs) into ooc ytes or early embryos involves a simple microinjection of mRNA that enc odes the nucleases. Moreover, the use of mitochondrial localization signal (e.g., Cox8 a nd ATP5b) restricts the translocation to mitochondria alone. A caveat of this technology is that elimination of high levels of mutated Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 196 HUMAN GENOME PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION mtDNA in oocytes will lead to the generation of embryos with a low number of normal mtDNA that, if failing to replicate after implantation, c ould lead to pregnancy loss. PGD could be used for the selection and transfer of embryos containing highe r levels of normal mtDNA. Importantly, unlike nuclear editing, mtDNA editing is not aimed to correct the mutations, but to eliminate mutated DNA, which is possible due to the presence of multiple copies of mtDNA in the oocytes. Moreover, due to the very low activ ity of repair mechanisms in mitochondria, the frequency of re-ligation of target mtDNA and in troduction of new mutations would be very rare. In addition, similar mitochondrial editing tools in the future could also be used to eliminate mutated mtDNA in gametes derived from stem cells. Finally, a combination of mitochondrial gene-editing tools with mitochondrial replacemen t techniques may represent an alternative option, in the future, to prevent the germlin e transmission of muta tions in the mtDNA responsible not only for mitochondria l specific diseases but also fo r situations where alterations in mitochondrial function contribute to pathol ogies such as cancer, diabetes, and aging- associated diseases. THE CHALLENGE OF DELIVERY In addition to the technical advances being made to genome-editing systems, an important challenge for in vivo use is effective delivery.

All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION 207 Appendix B International Research Oversight and Regulations The governance of research and clinical trials using human genome editing is expected to draw on the foundation of interna tional and national regulations, policies, and guidance that apply to other areas of clinical research a nd development, including other types of genetic technologies, stem cells, reproductive medicine , and research involving human embryos. This appendix provides further information on some of these systems. It is not meant to be comprehensive, but rather to provide perspectives on how issues are addre ssed in countries other than the United States. PUBLIC CONSULTATION CAN FORM PA RT OF A GOVERNANCE STRATEGY There are numerous examples around the world of the use of public consultation on a wide range of biomedical and environmental policie s (see Box B-1 for two examples described in greater detail). In the United States, the Na tional Environmental Policy Act is unusual among environmental laws, because rather than directly regulating action, it simp ly provides that when the government makes a major decision, it must be subjected to a higher than usual degree of public scrutiny. By incorporating public comment, such public scrutiny creates political pressure that can drive decisions in one way or anothe r, and it allows for some interplay between government expertise/authority and public cons ultation. Canada, when it looked at assisted reproduction across many different forms, fo rmed a royal commission on new reproductive technologies that traveled the country from east to west, holding public hear ings on the topic. In the European Union (EU), genetically engineered foods are of special interest, and an EU directive requires public access to informati on whenever a product potentially affects biodiversity or other environmenta l elements. Public consultation is considered an alternative to a directive centralized form of governance, in which th e public can, through its own decentralized processes, exert pressure on govern ment or on industry and alter the direction or the speed of biotechnology innovation (Charo, 2016b).

All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance 208 HUMAN GENOME EDITING PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION BOX B-1 Two Examples of Public Consultation This box discusses examples from France and the United Kingdom in which public consultations have been undertaken on human application of emerging technologies. The consultative approaches have similarities and differences that may be informative as other countries consider how to address scientific and ethical issues associated with human genome editing. In France, a General Public Discussion (\"Les \u00e9tats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de la bio\u00e9thique\") was organized prior to the 2009 revision of French Bioethics Laws. In addition to institutional reports and an interactive website, the consultation included three \"Consensus Conferences\" on bioethical issues, including embryo research and access to new reproductive technologies. A representative sample of 25 citizens was chos en using an opinion-poll method to participate in each conference. These participants attended weekend seminars and received instruction on the issues by a multidisciplinary team of experts. The citizens were also invited to a public debate where topical experts answered their questions. At the end of the process, each group of citizens drafted recommendations that were synthesized in the consultation's final report. Criticisms raised after the consultation included an impression that few citizen recommendations were incorporated in subsequent legal revisions and that the revisions did not address some of the social concerns raised by citizen panels. On the other hand, the consultative process provided an opportunity to broaden participation in the revision of the bioethics law, which was first implemented in 1994, based largely on recommendations of a national bioethics committee that consisted of experts such as doctors, biomedical researchers, philosophers, and representatives of religious denominations. Social values raised by consulted citizens, such as the desire for children to know their history or for a committed couple to access reproductive technologies regardless of sexual orientation, also had the opportunity to be expressed in an official forum, covered by the media, and to contribute to subsequent public discussions. More recently, the United Kingdom undertook consultations on mitochondrial replacement therapy, following a 2009 revision of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act (HFEA). Public workshops and debates and interactive websites focused on ethical issues the use of mitochondrial techniques might raise and whether such techniques should be permitted for use in clinical practice in the United Kingdom. The bal ance of views from this exercise, reported in 2013, was that such treatment techniques should be allowed but that their use should be carefully controlled. Further consultation was undertaken in 2014 on draft regulations. To ensure a large audience, a range of organizations was solicited, including patient groups, professional bodies, research bodies, genetic interest groups, and faith and community organizations, as well as individuals. A number of responses (1,857) were received from interested parties as well as from a number of individuals giving their views on the draft regulations. In comparison to the French process, the HFEA process included multisite public forums and a larger number of citizens providing input, as well as more focused recommendations due to the single-issue consultation. On the other hand, criticisms levied included that the processes and modalities were rule-guided rather than based on dialogue and deliberation, and that there was a lack of identifiable links between the consultation and the ultimate legislative outcome. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance APPENDIX B 209 PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION VOLUNTARY REGULATION THROUGH GU IDELINES IS ANOTHER COMPONENT OF GOVERNANCE Beyond consultation are voluntary self-regulati on and non-binding agreements. These are self-imposed rules that are seri ously constraining with respect to donation of tissu es, recruitment of donors, and experimentation that raises con cerns, such as the use of chimeras. Examples include the guidelines adopted by the International Society for Stem Cell Research, which have been amended to cover all forms of embryo researc h, from basic science to clinical trials with stem cells (ISSCR, 2016). Guidance also comes in the form of persuasive, albeit unenforceable, international instruments, such as those issued by the Council for Internat ional Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) for global standards fo r human subjects resear ch (Gallagher et al., 2000). At the far end of the spectrum, of course, there is regulation and legislation. Specifically with respect to gene therapy and germline manipul ation, there are a numbe r of international instruments of varying degrees of enforceabilit y. For example, the Council of Europe's Oviedo Convention says that predictive genetic tests should be used only for medical purposes. It specifically calls for a prohibition on the use of genetic engineering of the germline or changing the makeup of the following generations. It bu ilds on earlier European conventions, but like many international instruments, it is not ratif ied by every member country and, even when ratified, does not necessarily get implemented w ith domestic legislation. It has great normative value, but its enforcemen t-level value is uneven. REGULATORY APPROACHES VARY BY COUNTRY According to one recent review of gene-transfe r trial information from regulatory and other sources, as of June 2012 more than 1,800 trials ha ve been approved, initiated, or completed in 31 countries (Ginn et al., 2013; IOM, 2014). By mid-2016 that number had grown to more than 2,400, with trials primarily locate d in the Americas and Europe but nonetheless ongoing on every populated continent, and th e number of studies generally growing every year.70 The 2013 review reported that 65.1 percent of the trials were ba sed in the Americas, 28.3 percent in Europe, and 3.4 percent in Asia. Data from 2015 and 2016 show a similar pattern. Because more than half of all trials (63.7 percent, or 1,174) are associated with U.S. investig ators or institutions (Ginn et al., 2013), U.S. regulations that govern research funde d by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or subject to the NIH rules due to a federal-wide assurance will have some effect on how the work proceeds outside the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rules will also apply for products for which FDA approval is sought so that sale can proceed in the United States, regardless of funding source or whether the trial site is in the United States or abroad. Countries approach the structur e of their regulatory pathways in different ways. Japan has a regulatory pathway that tries to identify prospectively those th ings that are going to be high, medium, or low risk, and regulate them accordingl y. The United States follows a similar process in its regulation of medical de vices. But for drug regulation, the United States treats everything ab initio as equally dangerous and runs every proposed drug through the same rules for testing 70Gene Therapy Clinical Trials Worldwide, provided by the Journal of Gene Medicine. http://www.abedia.com/wiley/years.ph p (accessed January 30, 2017).

By contrast, in Japan there is an initial determination about the level of risk that is likely to be present for each proposed drug and the degree of stringency that the regulatory process must apply as a result. Japan has also added a conditional approval pathway specifically for regenerative medicine and gene therapy prod ucts, but it is too new for evaluation (Charo, 2016b). Singapore also has a risk-based approach simila r to Japan's, and for cell therapy it uses variables that include whether th e manipulation is substantial or minimal, whether or not the intended use is homologous or non-homologous, and wh ether or not this is going to be combined with some drug, device, or other biologic. Brazil provides an example of regulation and governance by accretion. It has approved laws related specifically to genetica lly engineered foods and stem ce ll research and cell therapy, but they are layered on top of earlier, more general rules, including c onstitutional prohibitions on the sale of any kind of human tissu e and 1996 laws on the patenting of human biological materials, creating a situation of confusion. The result has been a degree of paraly sis while the interplay among the laws is being managed. More generally, discourse in Latin America on human somatic cell genome editing has been informed by concerns about gene tically modified plants and anim als, biopiracy, biosecurity, and use of stem cells for clinical care. Mexico addr esses genetic engineering in the context of GMOs and biosecurity in its general health law and in its research regulations.71 Brazil addresses gene editing in its Biosafety Law, implicitly permitting at least some somatic gene-editing research in humans, although its primary focus is clearly on GMOs.72 Similarly, Ecuador's Constitution has provisions addressing genomic he ritage in the setting of GMOs and biopiracy, and in its guarantee of personal integrity it prohibits the use of genetic material for scientific research in violation of human rights.73 A few jurisdictions in Latin America have explicitly addressed somatic genome editing, typically imposing restrictions aimed at prohibiting uses that might be perceived as \"enhancement\" rather than treatment or prevention of disease and injury. Ch ile states that gene editing \"in somatic cells will be authorized only fo r the treatment of diseases or to prevent their occurrence\" in a far reaching law that also addresses intellectua l property, discrimination, and protection of genetic identity, as well as prohibiting \"eugenic pr actices\" (with an exception for genetic counseling).74 In Panama and Mexico City, use of genetic manipulation except for the elimination or treatment of a serious defect or disease is punishable by a prison sentence of 2 to 6 years.75 Colombia's penal code similarly permits genetic modification for treatment, diagnosis, 71Ley General de Salud, Titulo Decimo Segundo.

Interestingly, Ecuador promulgated an extensive set of regulations governing the use of biological samples and genomic data, specifically citing, inter alia, the biopiracy of DNA from an indigenous population in that country.

In 2007, the EMA established the Co mmittee for Advanced Therapies as the unit responsible for assessing the quality, safety, a nd efficacy of medicines made from genes and cells\u2014medicines that are termed \"advanced therapy medicinal products.\" This committee provides a centralized procedure for the assessmen t and approval of medicines for marketing in the European Union. The process is mandatory fo r biologics, including gene and cell therapy products, and a number of other pr oduct categories, in cluding medicines for the treatment of HIV/AIDS and cancer (Cichutek, 2008). EMA, however, does not have authority to re view and approve protocols for clinical research, including gene-transfer research (Pignatti, 2013). That authority resides with national regulatory agencies, but every EU state has adopted the EU Dir ective on Clinical Trials (Kong, 2004). It requires member states to adopt a system for the review of clinical research consistent with internationally recognized standards for good clinical practice for the ethical and scientifically valid design, conduc t, and report of trials (Kong, 2004) . FDA, which participated in the international process for developing these st andards, also recognizes these standards and publishes them as guidance documents (FDA, 2012). 77 As with Europe, China has a regulatory fram ework for the development and use of human medical products. Although it is not yet amended to address genome editing specifically, frameworks governing gene and cell therapies ha ve been implemented and the State Food and Drug Administration (the predecessor of the current China Food and Drug Administration [CFDA]) approved a gene-therapy product for mark eting. In addition, regulatory guidelines for human embryo research and in vi tro fertilization (IVF) practices have been published by Chinese agencies (China Ministry of Health, 2001, 2003) . Within the current regulatory framework, human somatic cell genome editing may be cons idered a third category therapeutic technology rather than a drug. If so, it would be regul ated by CFDA and procedures would include evaluations for safety and efficacy through precli nical testing and clinical trials, similar to processes used by the FDA and the EMA. In add ition to CFDA, the Health and Family Planning Commission (HFPC), which regulates IVF clinics, is likely to be involved in oversight of human genome editing. Consultations would likely occur with agencies such as th e Ministry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, and Chinese Academy of Engineering to enable their positions to be incorporated into regulations. HERITABLE GENETIC MODIFICATIONS RAISE ADDITIONAL ISSUES A number of special regulatory and gove rnance issues may arise around use of human embryos and the potential for genetic changes to be made to the human germline.

As noted above, the Convention for the prot ection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine: Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine (\"Oviedo Convention\") de velops principles concerning a number of medical topics that raise bioethics issues. For co untries that have signed and ratified the treaty, the genetic constitution of the individual is to be protected against unlawful interventions seeking to modify the germline. A number of countries have also enacted nationa l laws, regulations, or guidelines that restrict human germlin e modifications (see Figure B-1). FIGURE B-1 Countries take varying approaches to the regulation of human heritable germline modifications. The countries in red have enacted legal prohi bitions on germline modification, while those in pink prohibit such modification through recommen dations or guidelines. Countries in grey have varying levels of regulation, with light grey representing restrictive and dark grey representing ambiguous regulations. SOURCE: Araki and Ishii, 2014. INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION ON TH E GOVERNANCE OF HUMAN GENOME EDITING IS DESIRABLE ALTHOU GH FORMAL REGULATORY HARMONIZATION SEEMS INFEASIBLE Given the global nature of scie ntific and medical advances an d the diversity and complexity of approaches to regulating human genetic techno logies, there have been calls for international collaboration, cooperation, and even harmoni zation of regulations governing human genome editing. Arguments can be made both for and ag ainst an international convergence of national regulation of genomic technologies (Breggin et al., 2009; Marchant et al., 2012). A compelling argument for creating uniform or consistent regula tions of gene editing is to avoid \"regulatory havens\" that circumvent restricti ons if providers or consumers trav el to jurisdictions with more Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance APPENDIX B 213 PREPUBLICATION COPY\u2014SUBJECT TO FURTHER EDITORIAL REVISION lenient or non-existent regulations in order to undertake the restricted procedures (Charo, 2016a). The potential for lucrative medical tourism may create a \"race to the bottom\" that encourages laxer standards in nations seeking revenues from medical tourism (Abbott et al., 2010). Consistent standards may also promote equal hea lth protection for citizens of all nations and provide consistent requirements for companies a nd scientists in the fi eld, reducing transaction costs and increasing economies of scale (Vogel, 1998). Harmonized standards also provide economies of scale for regulators, reduce admini strative costs in adopting and administering national laws, and increase opportu nities to share regulatory resour ces and workload. Finally, the process of harmonization can promote the exch ange of good practices and build regulatory capacity (OECD, 2013). On the other hand, nations have different hist orical, economic, social, and cultural systems and values, which may translate into different approaches to the re gulation of a powerful technology such as human genome editing. Uniform national regulations may also subject every nation to the lowest common regulatory denom inator, depending on how harmonization is achieved. As a practical matter, reaching cons ensus among 100 or more nations on regulatory requirements for any technology is a laborious and resource-intensive unde rtaking that in the end may not be successful. Diversity in regula tory approaches also provides a natural experiment to evaluate the effects of different regulatory frameworks, providing a \"laboratory of nations\" that \"fosters innovati on and rapid learning about th e impact of striking different balances between innovation and precaution\" (E vans, 2015). However, re alizing this benefit requires procedures that facilitate the exch ange of information and promote learning. As summarized in Table B-1, there is a c ontinuum of approaches to aligning national regulatory requirements (Breggin et al., 2009). Harmonization usua lly involves the enforcement of identical or equivalent re gulatory requirements under the na tional laws of participating countries. Harmonization is usually accomplished thr ough an international treaty or other formal and binding legal instrument, implemented through the amendment of national laws to conform to treaty requirements (OECD, 2013). Internati onal treaties and other formal agreements are difficult and time consuming to negotiate, and often present difficult enforcement issues.78 Given these obstacles, there has been a trend away from treaties in the international governance of technologies and products in favor of mechanisms of international coope ration and coordination (Falkner, 2013; Susskind, 2008). Informal mechanisms of international coor dination and cooperation do not create legal requirements to implement specif ic provisions, but rather provi de general agreement between governments in the form of non-binding guidelin es, recommendations, consensus documents, statements of principles, or voluntary standard s. Such normative guidelines may be agreed upon in free-standing negotiations, but are often negot iated within an appropriate international organization (Abbott, 2014). Intern ational cooperation and coordina tion approaches can also be achieved through nongovernmental organizations, such as scientific soci eties, for example through the International Societ y for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) Guidelines for Embryonic Stem Cell Research (Daley et al., 2007). 78An example of the challenges associated with negotia ting and enforcing treaties was the unsuccessful attempt through the United Nations system in the early 2000s to create a binding international treaty banning human cloning (Cameron and Henderson, 2008).

(2009). We are gr ateful to Chatham House, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, for permission to reproduce a figure from the work titled: Securing the Promise of Nanotechnologies: Towards Transatlantic Regulatory C ooperation, authored by Linda Breggin, Robert Falkner, Nico Jaspers, John Pendergrass and Read Porter, 2009. The least formal mechanism of international convergen ce is policy diffusion through transnational regulatory dialogue and networking. This appr oach usually does not involve the creation of instruments that set forth specific substantive or procedural recommendations for nations to follow. Rather, it provides a forum for regulators from differe nt nations to share information, approaches, challenges, and ideas. An example is the International Dialogue on Responsible Nanotechnology, in which expert s from 25 national governments convened in a series of meetings every 2 year s to report on their regulatory ac tivities and challenges (Meridian Institute, 2004). Regulators who have been involv ed in international coor dination activities state that such person-to-person cont acts and communications provid e one of the most effective mechanisms for promoting international coope ration and understanding (Saner and Marchant, 2015). A convergence of regulatory approaches for human genome editing would have some beneficial effects as described a bove, but countries have already a dopted diverse laws relevant to human genome editing and a formal or comple te harmonization does not seem feasible\u2014and may not even be entirely desirable\u2014at this ti me. Moreover, national resp onses to human genome editing reflect unique historical, cultural, econom ic, and social factors. Notwithstanding these important differences that prevent uniform intern ational standards, there are important benefits for providing for robust communication and c oordination between regulators in different countries, and potential opport unities for identifying common gr ound on specific substantive or technical aspects as well as oppor tunities to produce learning be nefits (e.g., Zhai et al., 2016).

The committee also explored fundamental, underlying principles that could be adapted by a ny nation considering the development of guidelines for human gene editi ng. To respond comprehensively to its charge, the committee examined data from a variety of sources, including a review of the literature, open-session meetings and conf erence calls, public te stimony and input, and other publicly available resources. COMMITTEE COMPOSITION The National Academies of Sciences, Engineer ing, and Medicine (the National Academies) appointed a committee of 22 experts to undertak e the statement of task. The committee was composed of members with expertise in basic sc ience, clinical research and medicine, law and regulation, ethics and religion, patient advo cacy, science communication, public engagement, and the biomedical industry. Appendix E provides the biographical information for each committee member. MEETINGS AND INFORMATIO N-GATHERING ACTIVITIES The committee deliberated from December 2015 to January 2017 to conduct its assessment, and gathered information and data relevant to its statement of task by conducting a review of available literature, inviting stak eholders to share perspectives at public meetings, and soliciting public comments both online and in person. Literature Review Several strategies were used to identify lite rature relevant to the committee's charge. A search of databases, includi ng Medline, Embase, and LexisNexis , was conducted to obtain articles from peer- reviewed journals that discussed basic research, clinical applicat ions, patient safety, scientific standards, ethics, oversight, and social issues a ssociated with human gene editing.

In addition, committee memb ers, speakers, sponsors, and other interested parties submitted articles, reports, and polic y statements on these topics. The committee's database included several hundred relevant arti cles and reports, and was updated continuously throughout the study process. Public Meetings Four of the five meetings held over the course of the study included sessions in which committee members obtained input from a range of stakeholders and members of the public. Three meetings were held in Washington, DC (December 2015, February 2016, and July 2016), and one meeting was held in Paris, France, hos ted by the French National Academy of Medicine (April 2016). The committee's first meeting in December 2015 was held in association with the 3-day International Summit on Human Gene Editing: A Global Discussion, co-hosted by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, U.S. National Academy of Medicine, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and The Royal Society of the Unite d Kingdom. Although a separate ad hoc committee planned the summit, it provided a critical oppor tunity for the study committee to gather information. The summit convened experts from ar ound the world to discuss scientific, ethical, and governance issues associated wi th human gene-editing research. 79 The committee's second meeting in February 2016 included perspectives from potentially affected stakeholder communities such as pati ent groups and representatives from companies developing gene editing -based therapeutics. It also featur ed presentations from experts on models for public engagement as well as fe deral and institutiona l oversight bodies. The study's third meeting in April 2016, hos ted by the French National Academy of Medicine in Paris, France, explored the principles underl ying governance of gene editing. Speakers during the meeting provid ed international perspectives spanning permissive, neutral, precautionary, and preventive governance approach es. Meeting discussions also addressed potential therapeutic clinical a pplications for human germline gene editing. This meeting was held the day following a gene-editing workshop convened by the Federation of European Academies of Medicine (FEAM/UK ). A number of committee member s were able to participate in the preceding FEAM workshop, which provided an important opportunity to learn further about gene-editing regulatory and governance co ncerns and strategies across the European community. Finally, the study's fourth meeti ng in July 2016 provided input on se veral of the social issues associated with human gene editing, includi ng race and genetics in U.S. history and the 79The list of speakers at the International Summit incl uded Peter Braude, Annelien Bredenoord, Philip Campbell, Alta George Daley, Marcy Darnovsky, Victor Dzau, Fola Barbara Evans, William Foster, el Friedrich, Haker, John Harri s, John Holdren, Rudolf Jaenisch, Weizhi Pierre Jouannet, J.

The list of sp eakers who provided input to the committee in these meeting sessions is below. Public Comments The committee's data-gathering meetings also provided opportunities for the committee to engage and interact with a variety of stak eholders. Each public meeting included a public comment period, in which the committee invited input from any interested party. The committee also worked to make its activities as transp arent and accessible as possible and to accommodate those with special needs or those who may not have been able to attend in person. The study website was updated regularly to refl ect the recent and pla nned activities of the committee. Study outreach also included a st udy-specific email address for comments and questions and social media feeds and tags. A s ubscription to regular em ail updates was available to share further information and solicit ad ditional comments and input to the committee. Live video streams with closed captioning and links to an online public comment tool were provided throughout the course of the study to allow the opportunity for input from those unable to attend meetings in person. All online comm ents and submissions were catalogued in the study's public access file.
