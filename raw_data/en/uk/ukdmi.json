Would he require vaccination? 7 Answers [Dr. George L. Blum](/Expert/2023175-George-L-Blum)Pediatrician Franklin, MI Not needed, if he has been getting his regular immunizations. Wash with soap and watch for infections. [Dr. Susan Lynn Robbins](/Expert/621264-Susan-Lynn-Robbins)Pediatrician Hattiesburg, Mississippi If this was a provoked attack, the risk of rabies is very low. If the cat came out of the woods and scratched but did not bite, the risk is low. However, if you cannot find the cat and he was bit go to the ER for further evaluation. If he has had his school shots his tetanus is up to date. If he has not had them, it would be a good idea to go ahead and get them. [Dr. Ramzi A. Haroun](/Expert/1046433-Ramzi-A-Haroun)Pediatrician Hopkinsville, KY Children who are healthy with no problems with their immune system should recover without treatment. In children with a weak immune system, treatment with antibiotics usually has a recovery time within a week or two. There is no vaccine available for cat scratch disease. A child who has had contact with an infected cat can show some of the following: -Bump at the site of the injury (usually the first sign) -Fatigue -Fever (in some children) -Headache -Lymph node swelling near the site of the scratch or bite -Bump at the site of the injury (usually the first sign) -Fatigue -Fever (in some children) -Headache -Lymph node swelling near the site of the scratch or bite [Dr. Thomas Connolly](/Expert/8129204-Thomas-James-Connolly)Pediatrician Jacksonville, Florida There is no formal vaccine for cat scratch disease. The only vaccine to contemplate is if the child was behind on his/her tetanus boosters (the scratch occurred outside with the cat). [Dr. Hariram Ganesh](/Expert/1690768-Hariram-Ganesh)Pediatrician Roslyn, NY No he shouldn't need to get vaccinated if he got his routine 4 year old shots, which contain the Tetanus Booster. You just need to clean the wound with soap and water. [Dr. Rubina Azam](/Expert/3073156-Rubina-Azam)Pediatrician Panama City, FL If your child is caught up on the DTAP vaccine, he should not require any additional vaccination.

Stevenson](/Expert/542820-Shannon-L-Stevenson)Pediatrician Kalamazoo, MI If your child is up to date on vaccination he/she should not need any additional vaccine after a catch scratch. However, some infections are easily acquired from a cat scratch, I would keep the are clean, apply Vaseline or some other non medicated ointment daily or more, and monitor for signs of infection like redness, swelling and any discharge. If you see that, be sure to contact your family physician/pediatrician for advice. "}
