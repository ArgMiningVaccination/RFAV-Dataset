The meeting was called to order at 2:30 p.m. by Chairperson Cheryl Cooky . 2. The minutes of the 17 February 2020 Senate meeting were approved as distributed. 3. The March Senate Agenda was approved as distributed. 4. Senate Chair Cheryl Cooky presented Remarks of the Chairperson ( see Appendix A ). 5. President Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr . presented Remarks from the President ( see Appendix B). 6. Question Time. Professor Linda Prokopy thanked the President and others who initiated the funds to help struggling students and asked about the allocation of the funds mentioned by President Daniels during his remarks. President Daniels does not have the answer but will get her an answer from the operating team as soon as he can. Professor Sanders thanked Chair Cooky and President Daniels for their remarks as they were important and moving. He noted that during the February Senate meeting President Daniels mentioned that students and their families would have spent $600 million more if Purdue had raised tuition at the average Big 10 rate from 2013 to 2020. He is interested in the breakdown of the $600 million figure by students from Indiana, domestic out -of-state students, and international students. President Daniels said most of the savings would have accrued for out-of-state students as most of our tuition is paid by out -of-state students. We did not differentiate among the student group, but that time could come . When we held the line on tuition, we did it for everyone regardless of the state or country of origin. We have not discriminated and want to continue to attract students from other states and countries. During those years, we did reduce the percentage of international students. Roughly two -thirds of the savings that would have accrued to non- Hoosiers would have shifted to students from other U.S. states. Professor Jozef Kokini also thanked President Daniels for his overview of the current situation. He suggested that the changes to our educational system mentioned by President Daniels may involve downsizing of the system. Given that Purdue is a world -class University wi th tremendous strengths, he wanted to know if this was an advantage or disadvantage for Purdue. President Daniels stated we need to upsize, not downsize higher education in the U.S. The education system may need to diversify to be delivered to different people at different points in life and in different modes . He does not foresee a shrinkage in the amount of learning that occurs by students in post -secondary education. We were already seeing changes in the types of students such as those older than traditional -age students. It is likely we will see an acceleration of these changes. Universities are scrambling to deal with the current situation as they try to deliver courses in new ways . We will all learn a lot about how to do that. On the demand side, students will ask questions about the means of receiving their education. He can imagine ways in which this works to our long- term advantage. It will be to our advantage, i f we can continue to offer an unquestionably valuable education taught to high s tandards rigo rously and adapt some of the new delivery modes more quickly than other institutions. We are also a more affordable option than many institutions. In times like these, there is opportunit y for institutions that adapt or evolve effectively and swiftly and emerge at least as strong or stronger than before. That should be our goal . Professor Paul Robinson asked if any consideration had been given to identifying the PPE on campus that could be provided to local health care community in case they run out. President Daniels said this has been done. In addition, Purdue may be able to produce more PPE. He thought we are already 3-D print ing components for masks, for example. Purdue is also prepared to provide temporary quarantine space for at -risk patients and health care workers, if we are called on to do so . We are also beginning to prepare for drive -by testing to start with the Purdue community. If we and the state can muster the resources, he would like to help the community in that way, too . Professor Alice Pawley suggested there is not enough recognition of the trauma to students , staff, and faculty from the situation this semester. She teaches a class of 120 students first -year engineering students . She suggested we are likely to have 7. 8. 9. students who die. She has been contacted by students who do not know how they will pay their bills as part -time jobs have dried up. These are not ideal learning conditions . She asked: \"How are we designing various educational policies in recognition of the trauma many of us are experiencing or coming to experience?\" She has heard about possible suspension of students going on probation, permitting Pass/Fail grading for required courses and even having a global policy on Pass/Fail, how this semester will affect overall grade point averages. She would like to see a summary of core educational policies that are currently being discussed for revision. President Daniels said there will be a bulletin soon, if it has not gone out already, from Provost Akridge that addresses these very issues. There will be flexibility for students that has never existed. The general tilt is to continue with grading and fair evaluation but provide necessary flexibility for students. The administration has heard from many faculty members who are supportive of flexibility in this situation. We have given refunds already for room and board. We will continue to do what we can to alleviate the concerns and anxiety that people are naturally feeling. He said to look for a bulletin that goes into more detail about Pass/Fail options and about leeway that has not been in our policies in the past. Professor Cooky has spoken with Vice Provost Beth McCuskey about these concerns. Vice Provost McCuskey noted that our Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) Office remains in business . The CAPS staff has done individual training to be able to deliver services remotely and they are doing more tele-counseling. We have some limited in- person staff available for wal k-in clients. The more we can do to acknowledge the human aspects of this situation affecting our students and communicate our support of them and to each other as well, the better chance we have of getting through this together . Provost Akridge mentio ned we are working with Associate Deans and the Senate and we should have something out tomorrow or Wednesday at the latest dealing with the issues raised by Professor Pawley. We will have good solutions to provide a safety net for those students who str uggle. We will continue to provide instruction and assessment as we normally would. Secondly, we will use all available student support resources made available virtually including supplemental instruction. A great deal of effort has been put in to get the courses stood up and all the student support services that assist students in their academic endeavors will be available. No Memorial Resolutions were received since the February Senate meeting. Representing the Steering Committee , Professor Deborah Nichols presented the R\u00e9sum\u00e9 of Items under Consideration (ROI) by various standing committees ( see Appendix C). Professor Fred Berry , Chair of the Nominating Committee , introduced Senate Document 19-20, Nominees for Senate Vice- Chair , for Action. A motion was made and seconded to approve the document. Professor David Sanders made a motion to postpone the vote and his motion was seconded by Professor Ralph Kaufmann. The motion reads as follows: \"Given the importance of the pending report from the commission of inquiry, it is moved that the vice chair election be delayed until the report from EPIC is provided to the Faculty Affairs Committe e.\" Professor Kaufmann objected to voting \"yes\" or \"no\" via Zoom as it is not a secret vote. He asked for a Qualtrics vote instead. His request was granted and a Qualtrics voting survey was created and distributed to the Senators. This voting method allowed for anonymity. In her role as Chair of the Faculty Affairs Committee, Professor Prokopy noted that the EPIC report will not be done until after the April Senate meeting. A postponement would mean we do not vote this academic year on the position of Vice- Chair. In addition, the members of the EPIC do not think anything they are discussing will impact anything happening in the Senate this year. None of the alleged charges under investigation have anything to do with the election of a Vice- Chair of the Senate. It is unclear to Professor Prokopy, regardless of the report from the EPIC, why this would impede moving forward with the Vice -Chair election at this time. Professor Sanders disagreed and suggested the Senate needs to hear the report. In addition, he asked if the Chair could decide if he is able to say whatever he wants to say on the Senate floor. The Parliamentarian noted that the Chair could decide if comments are relevant or dilatory. Professor Nichols then read the description of dilatory tactics from the AIP Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure (p. 130). Following the discussion o f the motion, the vote was taken via the Qualtrics survey and the motion to postpone was defeated with 15 votes in favor and 61 in opposition with four abstentions. The candidates then spoke to the Senators about their vision for the Senate and faculty governance. During the remarks period, one candidate spoke against the candidacy of one of the other Vice-Chair nominees. Th ose remarks prompted Professor Erik Ot\u00e1rola - Castillo to call for decorum from the Senators when speaking about colleagues. Following the remarks by the candidates, the vote was taken with the following results: Professor Stephen Beaudoin 58 votes Professor Ralph Kaufmann 18 votes Professor Jozef Kokini 4 votes Professor David Sanders 7 votes With a clear majority of the votes, Professor Stephen Beaudoin was elected as the next Vice-Chair of the Senate with a term beginning 1 June 2020. 10. Professor Andrew Freed, Chair of the Educational Policy Committee (EPC) introduced Senate Document 19 -13, Proposed Changes to the Foundational Outcomes Language of the University Core Curriculum , for Action. Professor Freed explained the rationale for the proposed changes. A motion to approve the document was made by Professor Nichols and seconded by Professor Beaudoin. No discussion occurred and the vote was taken. Senate Document 19- 13 was approved by majority voice vote with one vote in opposition . 11. Professor Freed introduced Senate Document 19-14, Grief Absence Policy Revision II , for Action. Professor Freed explained the rationale for the proposed changes. He also explained that the EPC removed specific examples from the previous version to avoid confusion, i.e., if something is not included in the examples, it would be something different and not applicable to this policy. At the end of the document the EPC made more general recommendations that both students and faculty should use good judgment on what are acceptable reasons for missing classes . The EPC also changed faculty are \"encouraged\" to \"required\" to cooperate with students who miss coursework due to religious observances. Removing the list of specific examples and changing the wording associated with religious observances were the two changes based on recommendations voiced during the February Senate meeting. Professor Ruple made a motion to approve the document and was seconded by Professor Nichols . Vice President Rollock noted that some words were dropped from the document in Section 2. Professor Freed stated this was an erroneous deletion and the words will be reins erted. The corrected document will be posted on the Senate's website. The discussion ended and the vote was taken . Senate Document 19 -14 was approved by majority voice vote with one vote in opposition. 12. Professor Freed introduced Senate Document 19- 17, Degree Requirements for Civics Literacy , for Discussi on. Before providing the rationale for the document, Professor Freed noted the voting results from the EPC members. Professor Freed provided background to explain where we are today via a PPT presenta tion (see Appendix D ). He also provided the report of the Civics Literacy Working Group ( see Appendix E ). Discussion followed Professor Freed's review of the work done to create the document . Senator Taylor Bailey asked for examples of option #3 in the document concerning civics -related, Purdue -hosted and sponsored events. Professor Phillip VanFossen was present and elaborated on the discussions surrounding this point by the members of the Civics Literacy Working Group . The Working Group mem bers wanted to present a wide variety of lecture opportunities for students to complete option #3. The Working Group members know that work needs to be done to identify the types of acceptable opportunities as well as how to document participation in the activities. With technology and software such as Portfolium, the ability to document student participation exists. For example, his center on campus co -hosts with the Krannert School the Purdue Series on Corporate Citizenship and Ethics. The program has invited speakers ranging from Ken Burns to former politicians and attorneys general as speakers and these activities would satisfy option #3. In terms of contact hours, that will need additional work to have equivalence between this option and a 3 -credi t hour course. Option 3 would be done by the students over their undergraduate career and would not have to be done in one semester academic year. Professor David Koltick expressed concern about a long -term burden associated with option #3 as opposed to completing the requirement in one semester. He is also concerned about the verification/documentation that students have attended the lectures or other activities. Professor Pawley wondered why this requirement is not part of the Core Curr iculum process as the Working Group has drawn a similarity between the Core Curriculum process and this proposal. She was also concerned about who would oversee the external examination process and how faculty would be involved in the process . Vice Provo st Dooley noted that many universities have a Civics Literacy requirement as part of their core curriculum while others have it as a separate degree requirement. One of the options for Purdue is to make it part of the Core. Courses identified for option #1 would come out of the Humanities and Behavior al Sciences and this would be a nice framework as they would fall directly into these areas. Vice Provost Dooley's suggestion is that it should be faculty that shape what this l ooks like and should include faculty such as Professors VanFossen, Jay McCann, and Robert Browning. He would submit to the Senate that should be the group to look at this. Professor VanFossen mentioned that in Florida, due to legislative requirement, they are using the U.S. naturalization/citizenship 100 item test question bank in the Canvas learning management system. They are using it similarly to the way Purdue uses the WebCert program for certification of faculty on our campus. It is loaded into the student's Canvas account and is password protected. The students need to earn 60 out of 100 to pass the requirement. Professor VanFossen explained we would develop our own online instrument. The Working Group members expressed concerns about using the citizenship test questions as these have been called into question for their validity and predictive power in terms of the nature of the questions. We would develop our own instrument with key civics knowledge as part of it . We would not use the question whole cloth as Florida does. Professor McCann agreed with the summary of the deliberation presented by Professor VanFossen . We are trying to develop an exam that is psychometrically appropriate and will get the coverage that is substantively relevant. This is just the first step in our process . A pilot test was circulated and served the first step in an assumed iterative process . Professor Sanders noted the poll of faculty suggested there is strong opposition to using an examination to satisfy the Civics Literary requirement. We do not have examinations for other requirements for graduation. Professor Sanders took issue with the way the Civics Literacy Working Group was created and its description in the document as they do not accurately reflect what happened. He did not agree that as a first step the University Senate determined a baseline of civics literacy knowledge for new Purdue undergraduate was needed. He stated this never happened. He disagreed that the Senate provided consent of assembly for this report and consent of assembly is not in our Bylaws. Hence, the updates from and report of the Working Group were not approved by the Senate. The report of the Working Group is not emerging from the Senate in Professor Sanders' opinion. It is permissible for the EPC to make the recommendations that are in the document, but the report did not come out of the normal Senate processes. Professor Cooky reminded the Senate that President Daniels is a voting member of the Senate and he did introduce the original Civics Literacy proposal at the Senate meeting of January 2019. Professor VanFossen asked for and received permission to respond to Professor Sanders' first point. Professor Natalie Carroll, Immediate Past Chair of the Senate, worked with people across campus to send out a broad survey to students, staff, graduate students, and faculty. Professor Sanders is correct that one of the items on the survey was to determine support or opposition to a stand -alone test for the Civics Literacy requirement. About 58% of faculty were opposed to a stand- alone test. What the working group is proposing is a response to the faculty opposition. The Working Group is not asking for a stand -alone test. In fact, the Working Group is not asking for anything specific, but sent the recommendations to the EPC which is asking for Senate consideration of the proposal. It is not a test alone, but a test -plus in response to faculty concerns. Professor Dorothy Teegarden also expressed concerns about a stand -alone test , who would control the test, and what it means for our students . We need to ensure faculty are involved in developing the test . Vice Provost Dooley noted in terms of the exam component we have expertise on campus for construction of exams of this type. We also have subject matter experts on campus. Other states are using exams that can serve as models for us. Most of the people with expertise are part of the committee that developed the report. He echoed Professor VanFossen that an exam alone is not enough to capture the value side of the equation. If we have a Civics Literacy requirement, we want to have test -plus and then we will look for the options to get there. As with any exam that is out there, it would be constantly evaluated and updated, and the validity of the questions would be ascertained to avoid bias . With respect to faculty oversight, the existing Undergraduate Curriculum Council members spend a great deal of time and effort on a five- year cycle reviewing the foundational outcomes to ensure this is what we want to do. They are quite rigorous in their review process. Vice Provost Dooley would expect the same model to be followed here as well. Professor VanFossen referred the Senate to the Working Group's report and page 2 has a brief overview of specifications for what a Civics Literacy instrument might contain. 13. 14. 15. Professor Cooky encouraged the Senators to review the report and refer questions to her or members of the working group. Professor Freed next introduced Senate Document 19 -15, Revised Academic Progress and Records (APR) Committee Charge, for Discussion. Professor Freed explained the rationale for the document and referred the Senators to the Senate website which has the current charge to the APR Committee . The APR Committee had been moribund for many years and one consideration was to disband the committee. In discussions with the members of the EPC, it was determined that a large part of the work of the EPC involves student regulations. The EPC was finding it difficult to work through all the regulations. Following the discussions, it was decided to restart the APR Committee with Professor Sammie Morris as the current Chair. Under the leadership of Professor Morris, the APR has done the bulk of the work associated with student regulations, such as the changes to the Grief Absence Policy approved at today's meeting. The current work of the committee does not match exactly with the existing charge, so the proposal is designed to reflect the current situation. Any questions about the document should be sent to Professor Freed prior to the next Senate meeting . Professor David Sanders , Chair of the Student Affairs Committee (SAC) introduced Senate Document 19- 18, Mental Health Statement on Course Syllabi , for Discussion. Professor Sanders explained the rationale for the document. This is a student -sponsored document coming from through the SAC and builds on the work of the Student Sena te. This proposal is asking for faculty to add Purdue's mental health statement to their syllabi. It will serve to remind students of the availability of mental health resources for those who need them. The proposal also encourages, not requires, all course instructors to take time during the first week of classes to speak about the various mental health resources available to students . Professor Koltick noted that in his department people are not in favor of putting so many statements in their syllabi. Syllabi are getting very long with all the statements that are being added. He suggested this could be done during student orientation. Vice Provost Dooley mentioned that he has heard the same suggestion from other faculty members as the \"boilerplates\" for syllabi have steadily expanded. We have an option in the new Bright space learning management system to take the syllabi statements that are consistent across campus and include them in one section to automatically become part of the syllabi. The instructor -created portions of the syllabi would focus on course- specific material. Professor Brady supported th e idea of putting the consistent statements in Brightspace . Professor Koltick stated that the syllabus is a contract between the student and instructor, and he opposed bogging down the system with additional statements . Professor Pawley stated that she treats her syllabus as a contract and puts many statements in it, especially during these difficult times. Professor Sanders introduced Senate Document 19 -19, Food Insecurity and Grocery Store Resolution, for Discussion. Professor Sanders explained the rationale for the document and noted this is another student government -generated document. Due to the importance of this document and the fact the document somehow did not end up on the February Senate Agenda, Professor Sanders called for a motion to suspend the rules to allow a vote on the document at the current Senate meeting. Professor Pawley made the motion to suspend the rules. It was simultaneously seconded by Senator Bailey and Professor Beaudoin. The motion to suspend the rules was passed with a greater -than 2/3 rd majority in favor and two votes in opposition. During the discussion period on the main motion, Provost Akridge provided the administration's efforts including Student Life's involvement in a food pantry. PGSG President and University Senator Bailey have been involved in food drives and making food available for those in need. The Honors College is looking at instances of food insecurity across the campus. The College of Agriculture with the invol vement of other Colleges leads a food drive in the spring semester. Provost Akridge is not familiar with the PRF efforts towards opening a grocery store as described in the latter part of the document, but PRF representatives can speak to those efforts. Following the discussion period, a motion was made by Professor Conway to approve the document and the motion was seconded by Professor Kip Williams. The motion was approved by a greater than 2/3 rd majority vote in favor. 16. Professors Freed and Sander s introduced Senate Document 19- 16, SAT and ACT and Undergraduate Admissions , as a joint document from the EPC and the SAC, for Discussion. Professor Freed presented the background information from the EPC. In the EPC, healthy debate led to the EPC members not coming to agreement to bring the document to the Senate floor. It is now coming to the floor as a joint EPC/SAC document. Some of the EPC members were for the document, some were opposed to the document and some were undecided. In the end, the EPC members decided this debate should occur on the Senate floor. Professor Sanders provided the SAC perspective. This document has been under consideration for nearly two years. Professor Sanders spoke against this document as the SAC representative. He posed questions to the Senate about how they would decide if they knew the test results could be used by journalists, politicians, and school districts in ways the test -makers did not intend to be used. For example, by comparing how well school districts use resources or how good a college is . He noted that the proposal favors privilege and does not predict anything of an academic nature. Students from schools that prepare students by teaching to the test will do better. The tests measure opportunities available to some students, but not to all students. Those with the opportunities tend to do better than those without the same opportunities. He is strongly opposed to using the standardized test results as part of the admissions process. Vice Provost for Enrollment Management Kris Wong Davis provided the Admissions Office perspective via a PPT and a White Paper ( see Appendices F and G ). Professor Beaudoin expressed appreciation for the admissions data and asked if we have data about graduation success and success at the University. Math performance is a good predictor at least for first -year math courses, but does it correlate with overall success measures? Vice Provost Wong Davis said that slide #14 from the PPT answers the question. Professor Brad y wondered what should replace the data point current ly in use. Professor Freed stated that the EPC did not take a position on the matter. Professor Sanders suggested that the top X% of students from any Indiana high school be admitted to Purdue. This proposal would provide substitute data and promote diversity and equity in the incoming student population. However, the SAC members decided to leave that out and separate the issues. Professor Brady addressed the suggestion of admitting a top percentage from each school and this is something to consider at the April Senate meeting. She noted that Vice Provost Wong Davi s shared data concerning grade inflation and that it is tied to socio- economic factors . We need to be cautious about replacing the current process with one that works more poorly. Professor Brady would like to see data from institutions like Purdue that have eliminated standardized tests by the time the issue is discussed at the April Senate meeting. Vice Provost Wong Davis wondered if the discussion involved test - blind (elimination) or test -optional institutions as the data would be different from each type of institution. Professor Brady is interested in the test -blind institutions. Vice Provost Wong Davis said we could reach out to some open enrollment schools and look at their graduation and retention rates. Those institutions that have recently enacted these policies do not have much in the way of retention or graduation data. We can look at some long -standing test -blind institutions for their data. Those with long-standing policies would probably not be peer institutions. Professor Cooky wondered how the document arrived at the floor of the Senate if most of the EPC members did not support the document. Professor Freed noted t hat the inclusion of a fourth voting option of \"undecided and discussion should occur at the Senate\" led to half of the committee believing the arguments were good on both sides and, hence, its appearance at the Senate. Professor Sanders will reserve additional comments for the April Senate meeting. 17. Under New Business Professor Audrey Ruple introduced Senate Document 19 -21, COVID Statement , for Discussion. Professor Ruple explained the proposal and its rationale. Professor Prokopy made a motion to suspend the rules and allow a vote on the document at the current Senate meeting. Her motion was seconded by Professor Rhoads. A motion to approve the document was made by Professor Beaudoin and Seconded by Professor Rhoads. The document passed by unanimous vote. Provost Akridge noted that the international community at Purdue thanks the Purdue community for its support of the Asian community . 18. Having no additional business, the meeting adjourned at 5:57 p.m. University Senate Document 19- 20 23 March 2020 TO: The University Senate FROM: University Senate Nominating Committee SUBJECT: Nominees for Vice Chairperson of the University Senate REFERENCES: Bylaws, Section 3.20b, c DISPOSITION: Election by the University Senate The Nominating Committee proposes the following slate to serve as Vice Chairperson of the University Senate for the academic year 2020-2021.

Students participating in University-sponsored activities should be permitted to make up class work missed as a result of this participation. Ultimately students are responsible for all required coursework and bear full responsibility for any academic consequences that may result due to absence. Additionally, the University recognizes that in some circumstances, absence from class is unavoidable or is necessary to fulfill a required obligation. As such, 2 1. General Attenda nce Issues (University Senate Document 10 -8, March 21, 2011) Instructors are expected to establish and clearly communicate in the course syllabus attendance policies relevant to individual courses. Course attendance policies must be consistent with University policy. It is recognized that occasionally it may be necessary for a student to be absent from a scheduled course activity for personal reasons beyond his/her control (e.g., illness, family emergency, bereavement, etc.). The University expects each student to be responsible for class- related work missed as a result of an unavoidable absence; this work may be made up at the discretion of the instructor. Only the instructor can excuse a student from a course requirement or responsibility. When conf licts or absences can be anticipated, such as for many University sponsored activities and religious observances, the student should inform the instructor of the situation as far in advance as possible and the instructor should strive to accommodate the st udent. Individual course policies may state expected notification periods. For unanticipated or emergency absences where advance notification to an instructor is not possible, the student should contact the instructor as soon as possible by e-mail, phone, or by contacting the main office of the department that offers the course. When the student is unable to make direct contact with the instructor and is unable to leave word with the instructor's department because of circumstances beyond the student's cont rol, and in the University has establi shed the following as reasons to be granted an excused absence from class: Grief/Bereavement Military Service Jury Duty Parenting Leave Procedures and remedies for granting these absences for is specified in the sections below. The student bears the resp onsibility of informing the instructor in a timely fashion, if possible. The instructor bears the responsibility of trying to accommodate the student either by excusing the student or allowing the student to make up work, when possible. 1.

For unanticipated or emergency absences where advance notification to an instructor is not possible, the student should contact the instructor as soon as possible by e -mail, phone, or 3 cases of bereavement, the student or the student's representative should contact the Office of the Dean of Students. A member of the Dean of Students staff will notify the student's instructor(s) of the circumstances. The student should be awar e that this intervention does not change in any way the outcome of the instructor's decision regarding the students' academic work and performance in any given course. Regardless of whether these absences are anticipated or unanticipated, instructors are to allow for absences in accordance with the Student Bereavement Policy and in all other cases, are encouraged to accommodate the student. In certain laboratory-based or intensive short -term courses, a student can jeopardize his/her academic status with an unreasonable number of absences, particularly in lab courses that cannot be made up later. The student should always consult with the instructor to determine the potential impact of any absence. Students holding the opinion that they have been wrongly de nied an excused absence or the opportunity to make up missed work should contact the head of the department offering the course or the Office of the Dean of Students to attempt to resolve the conflict. 2. Conflicts with Religious Observances The University values a community with diverse backgrounds and traditions and recognizes that conflicts between regularly scheduled curricular activities and religious observances of some members of our community can arise. Instructors are encouraged to cooperate with students in dealing with work missed due to absences resulting from participation in religious observances. Students requesting special consideration in scheduling are encouraged to make this known to instructors well in advance, minimize the length of the absence, and be flexible in arranging alternative by contacting the main office of the department that offers the course.

I know this was not how most of us envisioned our spring break. I had hopes of immersing myself in data analysis for my latest research project, and also planned to spend two days in a writing retreat with my colleague working on our book manuscript. I imagine m any of you were also planning to use the time to catch up on writing and research, or perhaps taking family vacations ; and some may have simply wish ed to use the break to rest, relax, and recharge. Certainly, none of us expected to have the spring break we did. And a s a colleague said to me the other day, complaining about COVID- 19 is like complaining about the weather, we are all affected by it. Hopefully you had a chance to read my letter to the faculty from March 13. In that letter , I shared what the Senate has been doing in the transition. Moreover, w hile many of you were working overtime during your spring break to convert your spring semester to online learning, the Senate leadership was working over the spring break to convert our Senate meeting to a virtual one. As time went on it became increasingly obvious that a full virtual meeting was our only safe option. Thank you everyone for being here today and for some of you, your willingness to learn a new technology. To state what is now an overused, yet apt phrase, these are unprecedented times. COVID -19 presents an ever -evolving, fluid crisis . As such , we, faculty, staff, students and administrators, are being called upon to adapt to this ever -changing landscape. Historically, such calls are accompanied by a ppeals for perseverance, grit, and resilience . These calls for strength and determination, and persistence in the face of adversity are intended to be empowering and inspirational. This discursive context often enables and supports behaviors and perspectives that lead one to disconnect or disassociate from the experiential dimensions of the reality of the moment. I must admit I found myself captivated by such a mode of being as a doctoral student when I was diagnosed with advanced stage cance r. I had taken in the cultural messaging: Vulnerability was weakness, emotion was a liability . Determination and perseverance, a 'never give up' and a \"LiveStrong\" -attitude were what made me feel like I had a sense of control or agency over something of which I did not. Other than selecting the best medical care I could access, there was little I could do to control the outcome. Yet, reflecting back on my experiences, I now realize how this approach closed me off to fully sharing my experience with my fam ily and friends, and especially my fears. Now I have come to appreciate vulnerability as a strength, emotions as an asset that makes us human and is what connects us to others and binds us together. Vice Provost Dooley's letter today (March 23) echoes mu ch of what I wished to communicate with you today . I encourage you to read it, if you have not done so . Today, I wish to acknowledge and give voice to the ways in which faculty, staff, students, and administration, are all experiencing not simply the logistical challenges of transitioning our courses online, but also the emotional and mental dimensions of a profound change in the very foundations of how we live, work, and move through the world. The human element of the moment cannot be understated. While e xperts agree, social distancing is necessary to save lives; humans are social beings and along with the physical separation comes for many, disconnection, anxiety, isolation, and despair. I am reminded of a lesson I learned while seeking therapy during my cancer diagnosis. In one session, the therapist was communicating the importance of self- care. She asked if I had ever flown on an airplane. She reminded me of how the safety information card notes that in the event of a change in cabin pressure, passengers are instructed to put on their oxygen mask first and then help those around them. I replied, \"Ye ah, that never made sense to me. Why wouldn't you help the small child sitting next to you first ? They might pass out and die!\" To which she explained that we can not help others if we do not help ourselves . It was as if she was speaking to me in a foreign language. Now that I am older and have a bit more life experience under my belt, I realize the importance of that advice. The 'push through it' mentality while seemingly empowering in the moment, may very well lead to burnout down the road. As Vice Provost Dooley addressed, self -care is important for faculty, students, staff and administrators . We must put on our proverbial oxygen masks first before we can take care of others. I encourage you all to read NASA astronaut Captain Scott Kelly's article in the New York Times 1. Captain Kelly offers readers salient advice from his experiences on the International Space Station on ho w to cope with the isolation we are all experiencing as we work from home and socially distance. As I told my students last week, you did not register for an online course, and I certainly did not sign up to teach one ! We are all learning this together. There will be challenges for all of us as we move through the semester, some anticipated and others not. We need to be gentle with ourselves , and with each other , in setting expectations and recalibrating goals . We especially need to be understanding of ou r graduate and undergraduate students in terms of the myriad personal challenges they are facing -remember, for many , they spent last week moving out of their dorms or apartments and back home to their families For those who stayed, t hey too are transition ing to a semester where many of the events and activities they prepared for and looked forward to are now cancelled . Friends have left, and they are social distancing. To expect that we will be able to provide an equivalent learning experience online , or to expect students will be able to provide an equivalent level of learning and engagement is unrealistic given the current moment. We must recognize this reality : that whatever we can do, and whatever our students can do, will be the best we can do . We are all in this together, and together we will get through it. Thank you again for all you do for Purdue. 1 https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/opinion/scott- kelly -coronavirus-isolation.html Appendix B UNIVERSITY SENATE March 23, 2020 COVID -19 RESPONSE UPDATE Students on campus: Estimated 1,200 or 9% of those in university housing plan to stay Research Labs: o All core and shared labs operating with social distancing and telework. o >95% of all labs, including individual investigator labs operating at least remotely % of employees teleworking o Estimated at least 70% working remotely. o Precise numbers will be available daily starting Tuesday Parking: o Grad students can acquire a free permit to park in B or C lots to reduce need for public transportation.

Camp, Jr., jcamp@purdue.edu University Senate Minutes; https:/ /www.purdue.edu/senate Page 2 of 2 Appendix D Senate Document 19- 17 Proposal: Establish a baccalaureate degree requirement for civics literacy. The EPC's proposed resolution reflects the recommendation of the Civics Literacy Working Group: Establish a baccalaureate degree requirement for civics literacy. Students would meet the requirement by fulfilling the following: successful completion of a civics literacy exam and completion one of the following three options: 1) 3.0 hours of relevant course work (e.g., relevant introductory course in US politics, public policy, history or other course with civic knowledge content); or 2) successful completion of Center for C-SPAN Scholarship and Engagement modules; or 3) attendance at civics- related Purdue- hosted and -sponsored events involving a substantially equivalent number of contact hours. Justification of Civics Literacy Requirement at Purdue (from Civics Literacy Working Group report) Results of the most recent Grade 12 National Assessment of Educational Progress in civics indicated that only 24% of 12th graders scored at the 'proficient' level and that 36% scored below even a 'basic' level of civic literacy. A report commissioned by the U.S Department of Education, the National Task Force on Civic Learning and Democratic Engagement, an initiative of the Association of American Colleges and Universities made an urgent call to higher education institutions in the United States to make civic literacy, inquiry, and action part of the educational objectives to be achieved, by every college graduate. Evolution of Civics Literacy Requirement at Purdue January 2019, President Daniels proposed a requirement of passage of a civics test (based on the naturalization test) to earn a degree from Purdue University. Spring 2019, through a campus-wide survey and town hall, the University Senate determined a baseline of civics knowledge for new Purdue undergraduate students was needed. Summer 2019, the Chair of the University Senate convened a working group of disciplinary experts to explore how a civics literacy requirement might be employed at Purdue. February 2020, Civics Working Group delivered a recommendation for a civics literacy requirement to the EPC, which had many questions about the feasibility of implementing the recommendation. Evolution of Civics Literacy Requirement at Purdue March 2020, Civics Working Group provided an Addendum to their report outlining a plan to implement the recommended civics literacy requirement: The Provost will convene a group of key stakeholders and experts from across campus to work together on the logistics and details with a planned implementation as soon as Fall 2021. The Provost has assured the working group that the necessary resources to implement the graduation requirement will be allocated. Support has also been noted by the President and Board of Trustees. 40% of students are already meeting the requirement by taking a civics- related course, and that number could increase to 60% with AP credits. More work is necessary to develop online instrumentation that is psychometrically valid and academically rigorous and technology needs to be developed to attest to the authenticity of non-credit learning via civics- related events. EPC's Rationale for proposing a Civics Literacy Requirement Good justification and most EPC members felt that an education component in civics would increase the value of a Purdue degree. Since the requirement does not require an additional class (it is only an option), it need not disrupt current core class requirements adopted by departments and colleges across campus (a concern of several EPC members). Though many of the details of implementation are yet to be worked out, similar programs are already in place at other universities. With the Provost's assurance, technical/operational feasibility issues should not be problem. In its comprehensive and complex nature, the proposal is similar to that of the now successful core curriculum administered by the Undergraduate Curriculum Council, which has returned to the senate many times (including today) with updates. The proposed resolution is too important to die in committee. It is worthy of debate and vote by the entire University Senate. Appendix E Working Group on Civics Literacy Report to University Senate, Education Policy Committee January 28, 2020 (Revised1 March 2, 2020) The working group on civics literacy is recommending to the Education Policy Committee the following: Establish a graduation requirement for civics literacy for the baccalaureate degree for the Purdue West Lafayette campus. Students should be allowed to meet the requirement any time between freshman and senior year by fulfilling the following: successful completion of a civics literacy exam and completion one of the following options: 3.0 hours of relevant course work (e.g. relevant introductory course in US politics, public policy, history or other course with civic knowledge content); successful completion of Center for C-SPAN Scholarship and Engagement modules; or attendance at civics-related Purdue-hosted and -sponsored events. Introduction I know of no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves; and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them, but to inform their discretion. Thomas Jefferson (1820) As Jefferson's quote implies, a constitutional republic, such as the United States of America, requires informed, effective, and responsible citizens. Indeed, it has been said that 'democracy is not a machine that will go of itself\" and therefore requires each generation of citizens to develop, and employ, a certain level of civic literacy in order to sustain it. Defining and developing such civic literacy\u2014that is, the effective preparation of citizens to fulfill their responsibilities to sustain and enhance self-government--is an essential condition for our representative government to survive: \"Citizenship\u2014commitment to and participation in a community's civic life\u2014is the engine of constitutional democracy and a free society. Knowledge of the rights, responsibilities, and privileges of citizenship fuel that engine. Without the participation of informed, effective, and responsible citizens, a democratic republic cannot and does not function, nor can it make progress toward its ideals (NAEP Governing Board, p. 1, 2014).\" Unfortunately, the civic literacy of Americans has been a concern for over 75 years. For example, National surveys of college freshman in the 1940s revealed a \"striking ignorance\" of even the most basic civic knowledge (Fine, 1943, p. 1).\" In 2019, the Woodrow Wilson Foundation surveyed 41,000 Americans using 20 questions drawn from the USCIS Naturalization Panel. The results \"validated what studies have shown for a century: Americans don't possess the history knowledge they need to be informed and engaged citizens.... (Wilson Foundation, n.p. 2019)\" The Congressionally mandated National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) measures 1 See Addendum at the end of the document (page 12) , which addresses questions and feedback from the Education Policy Committee. 1 American K-12 students' progress in a number of subjects, including civics, every four years. Results of the most recent Grade 12 NAEP-Civics assessment indicated that only 24 percent of 12th graders scored at the 'proficient' level or above and that 36 percent scored below even a 'basic' level of civic literacy. In order to assess K-12 student progress in each subject, sophisticated assessment frameworks are developed by the National Center for Education Statistics. The most recent NAEP-Civics assessment framework (2014) was developed by a panel of more than two dozen experts in civics and civic education. The Civics Framework consists of three interrelated components: (1) civic knowledge, (2) intellectual and participatory skills, and (3) civic dispositions. These components have been identified by NAEP as essential elements of civic education in the United States, and therefore serve as a constitutive definition for 'civic literacy.' Thus, the 'civically literate' citizen must possess all three components. Civic Knowledge. The authors of the NAEP-Civics Framework determined that essential civic knowledge consisted of answers to questions such as: What are civic life, politics, and government? What are the foundations of the American political system? How does the government established by the Constitution embody the purposes, values, and principles of American democracy? What is the relationship of the United States to other nations and to world affairs? What are the roles of citizens in American democracy? Civic Skills. The authors of NAEP-Civic Framework identified both intellectual and participatory civic skills as essential components of civic literacy. \"Intellectual skills enable students to learn and apply civic knowledge in the many and varied roles of citizens...These skills help citizens identify, describe, explain, and analyze information and arguments, as well as evaluate, take, and defend positions on public issues. Participatory skills enable citizens to monitor and influence public and civic life by working with others, clearly articulating ideas and interests, building coalitions, seeking consensus, negotiating compromise, and managing conflict\" (NAEP Governing Board, p. x-xi, 2014). Civic Dispositions. These \"habits of the heart\" of democracy, as Alexis de Tocqueville called them, include the inclination to support the rights and responsibilities of all individuals in society, and to the advancement of the ideals of the polity. They also include the dispositions \"to become an independent member of society; respect individual worth and human dignity; assume the personal, political, and economic responsibilities of a citizen; participate in civic affairs in an informed, thoughtful, and effective manner; and promote the healthy functioning of American constitutional democracy ((NAEP Governing Board, p. xi, 2014).\" Rationale: The Importance of Civic Competency and Engagement in Higher Education Education leaders stress the need to include learning that is related to the development of individuals' civic capacity throughout all years of schooling in the United States (Conant, 1945; 2 Dewey, 1916; Ehrlich, 1997; Pollack, 2013). Scholars have examined a variety of sources of content and pedagogy in the U.S. as well as programs developed abroad. A report commissioned by the U.S Department of Education, the National Task Force on Civic Learning and Democratic Engagement, an initiative of the Association of American Colleges and Universities made an urgent call to higher education institutions in the United States to make civic literacy, inquiry and action part of the educational objectives to be achieved by every college graduate. This plan would involve adopting long-term, measurable standards to indicate the extent to which college students are gaining a civic perspective during their postsecondary education (National Task Force on Civic Learning and Democratic Engagement [National Task Force], 2012). By referring to a 'crucial moment\" in the title and throughout the text, the report emphasized a convergence of issues and concerns over the last decade. Higher education institutions themselves have acknowledged the importance of postsecondary education in developing civic learning, with 68% of Chief Academic Officers surveyed from the 433 member institutions of the Association of American Colleges and Universities recognizing civic engagement as an essential learning outcome (AAC&U, 2011; p. 20). A further exhortation appears in the National Task Force report that higher education institutions should be supported to \"develop a national framework of civic indicators across knowledge, skills, values, and collective action (National Task Force, 2012; p. 38). Taking concrete steps in this direction, the Research Institute for Studies in Education (RISE) at Iowa State University published a paper reviewing the literature on civic learning and engagement for the AAC&U and the American Association of State Colleges and Universities (Reason & Hemer, 2015). The groups in the higher education community mentioned above have extended calls to action in reports that focused on K-12 education, such as Guardian of Democracy: The Civic Mission of Schools (Gould, 2011). The widely cited report included calls for postsecondary institutions to \"require all students, regardless of major, to take at least one civic learning course\" and encouraged postsecondary students to \"volunteer as civic mentors in K-12 schools.\" (Gould, 2011, p. 43; Torney-Purta, et. al. 2015, p.2). Background and working group members In January 2019, President Daniels presented to the Purdue University Senate data on the state of civics literacy in the U.S. Some indicators suggest that many are unaware of basic knowledge regarding the United States government, its people, processes, and laws and policies. President Daniels would like to see Purdue University address this gap in civics literacy and offered a proposal to the University Senate on how we may do so. President Daniels proposed a requirement of passage of a civics test (based on the naturalization test) to earn a degree from Purdue University. As a first step, in spring 2019 through a campus-wide survey and town hall (initiated and led by then-Chair Natalie Carroll), the University Senate determined a baseline of civics knowledge for new Purdue undergraduate students was needed. During the summer, Cheryl Cooky, Chair of the University Senate convened a working group of disciplinary experts and tasked the group with exploring and creating a pilot assessment of civics knowledge to distribute to Purdue's incoming freshman class during Boiler Gold Rush (BGR). The purpose was to assess civic knowledge among incoming freshman as well as to assess the potential of such an instrument. The summer 3 working group included: Cheryl Cooky, (Interdisciplinary Studies and Chair of University Senate; Jay McCann (Political Science), Phillip VanFossen (Ackerman Center for Democratic Citizenship), Robert Browning (Political Science/ Center for CSPAN Scholarship and Engagement- CCSE), Peter Watkins (CCSE), Frank Dooley (Senior Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning), and Andy Zehner (Office of Institutional Research, Assessment and Effectiveness). During the September 10, 2019 University Senate meeting, Cooky presented preliminary results of the \"BGR survey\" to the Senate and the University Senate endorsed\u2014via consent of assembly\u2014the working group's continued efforts. During the fall of 2019, Nan Kong (University Senate, Education Policy Committee), Assata Gilmore (Vice President of Purdue Student Government), Jeff Stefancic (Office of Dean of Students. Education Policy Committee), and Michael Brzezinski (Dean of International Programs) joined the working group. Process During the summer of 2019, the working group began its discussions considering President Daniels' proposal for a graduation requirement in civics literacy, and guided by preliminary information from the spring 2019 Town Hall and Campus-Wide survey. The working group developed and implemented a survey as a baseline to determine incoming freshmen's knowledge of civics as well as to gain insight into the process of implementing an instrument of this type. The survey was delivered during BGR week. During the September 2019 University Senate meeting, Cooky presented preliminary results to the Senate and the University Senate endorsed\u2014via consent of assembly\u2014the working group's efforts. During the fall of 2019, the working group further analyzed the BGR results and refined the survey instrument. The refined survey was distributed in introductory political science courses as another pilot study. The working group further investigated questions that emerged from the spring 2019 campus- wide survey, including the question of whether non-domestic/ international students should also be required to complete a civics literacy requirement as well as soliciting further input from a sample of undergraduate students regarding the requirement. In addition, the working group surveyed other peer institutions who have civics literacy requirements to determine what peer institutions were requiring and what we might learn from them or how we might model a graduation requirement. The working group also discussed and considered other means by which we might assess student civic knowledge and literacy. These options included the CSPAN civic literacy modules (under development), extracurricular events and activities. Civics Literacy Survey/ Development of Instrument In order to determine the best course of action, it was necessary to establish a baseline. During BGR week, all incoming undergraduates were asked to participate in a short survey to assess their knowledge of civics, government, and US political history. The survey received IRB approval. Students were informed the survey was not a test or exam and the purpose of the 4 survey, to learn more about what students already know, was communicated to the students. Students were also informed their participation in the survey was voluntary and that responses would help the University Senate, President Daniels, and the faculty better understand this issue. The compiled results of the survey were shared with the University Senate (during the September meeting), and representatives from the Purdue Student Government. About the survey In February 2019, the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation released the results of a survey of 41,000 Americans basic knowledge of the American political system and of U.S. history. The 20 multiple-choice items used were developed by the Wilson Foundation using previous years' online practice exams for the United States Customs and Immigration Service (USCIS) Naturalization Interview (aka, 'citizenship test'). These practice tests (https://my.uscis.gov/prep/test/civics ) use the same 100 items as in the USCIS pool, from which 10 items are drawn at random prior to each Naturalization Interview. While issues have been raised concerning the reliability and validity of the USCIS citizenship test (which were presented and discussed at the spring 2019 Town Hall), the Wilson Foundation survey represented a very current--and national--sample frame against which incoming Purdue undergraduates could be compared; in order to do so, the same items had to be used. The final 8 items are adapted from the American National Election Study, an NSF-funded survey of the electorate that that has been conducted during major election cycles over the last sixty years (https://electionstudies.org/). The American National Election Study is one of the leading sources of data on civic attitudes and capabilities. This is a large study that will permit various subgroup comparisons (e.g., how Purdue freshmen compare to the general public, to Americans with a college degree, and to younger American). The working group created a survey utilizing portions of thesetwo instruments in order to make comparisons. Twenty questions were drawn from the Woodrow Wilson Foundation's national survey of civic knowledge (https://woodrow.org/news/one-state -pass-us-citizenship-exam/) and 8 questions were taken from the National Election Study ( https://electionstudies.org/). This survey was distributed by email to all incoming undergraduate students (n=7,926) during BGR week. Approximately 36% of incoming students responded, but\u2014due to incomplete responses or other factors--only 2,114 responses were accepted (26.7%) for analysis. The working group conducted a preliminary analysis of these data and first results indicated that incoming Purdue undergraduate student respondents appear to have greater civic knowledge than the general population across the United States, as well as the state of Indiana. In addition, incoming Purdue students appear to exhibit greater civic knowledge than other college graduates in Indiana. Results of the survey indicated that 77.8% of respondents 'passed' (scored 60% correct or higher) on the 20 items drawn from the WWF survey (as compared to 36% in the WWF sample). However, there were clearly different passage rates across resident/non-resident; domestic/international; and by race or ethnicity. Respondents to the National Election Survey instrument (8 items) scored in the 53% correct (\"On which of the following does the US 5 government currently spend the least?\") to 96% correct (Number of times an individual can be elected President?\") range. The pilot survey distributed in introductory political science courses raised further questions regarding a test as a graduation requirement that will be need to addressed should a civics literacy graduation requirement be approved. For example: What constitutes a passing grade on the test? Any test given will need to address and eliminate possible bias. Questions remain regarding who will administer the test, when and what appropriate entity will assess the exam. The working group recommends that if such a test becomes part of the civics literacy graduation requirement, more work will need to be done to develop the test, expand the test bank, and ensure academic integrity (in collaboration with ODOS). Survey of International Student Body The following question was asked of 600 randomly sampled international undergraduate students currently enrolled as freshmen, sophomores or juniors: If Purdue University requires all undergraduates to demonstrate \"civic literacy\" prior to graduation, how should this requirement be implemented? Please select all options below that would be acceptable to you: - Pass a course that covers the main foundations of government and civic life in the United States. Governments of other nations may also be covered in this course. - Successfully complete on-line educational modules that cover the foundations of government and civic life in the United States. -Pass either an in-person or on-line examination that covers the foundations of government and civic life in the United States. -Attend at least three campus events per academic year where speakers discuss governmental policies or issues in civic life. Such events would be designated in advance as counting towards the \"civics literacy\" requirement. We received 181 responses, a 30% rate of return. Of the 181 responses, only 16 students chose to write comments. Student were allowed to choose more than one option. Approximately 60% of respondents (109/ 181) indicated that they would find successful completion of online educational models an acceptable requirement. While just under 20% of respondents indicated course work would be acceptable. Approximately 30% of respondents indicated an online exam or campus events as acceptable. Survey of Overall Student Body In order to gauge the student body's opinions on the option of a graduation requirement on civics literacy, the Purdue Student Government was tasked with creating and administering two surveys 6 to all its members on civics literacy and on a possible civic literacy curriculum requirement. The four questions are the same that were used for a similar survey administered to international students. If Purdue University requires all undergraduates to demonstrate \"civic literacy\" prior to graduation, how should this requirement be implemented? Please select all options below that would be acceptable to you: -Pass a course that covers the main foundations of government and civic life in the United States. Governments of other nations may also be covered in this course. - Successfully complete on-line educational modules that cover the foundations of government and civic life in the United States. - Pass either an in-person or on-line examination that covers the foundations of government and civic life in the United States. - Attend at least three campus events per academic year where speakers discuss governmental policies or issues in civic life. Such events would be designated in advance as counting towards the \"civics literacy\" requirement. Survey 1 The first survey had a total of 69 responses and included closed and open-ended questions to gauge the Purdue Student Governments knowledge on civic literacy and engagement while also having respondents state their opinions on civic literacy testing and curriculum requirements. This survey found that 46% of respondents agreed that Purdue University should have a civics literacy requirement while 35% thought Purdue University should not have a civic literacy requirement and 19% had no opinion on the subject. Furthermore, when given five options (Online Module, Exam, Course, In-Person Verbal Response, Other) 50% of respondents thought this requirement should be an online module taken any time between freshman and senior year. Survey 2 The second survey had a total of 187 responses which included four close ended questions to determine the student body's opinions on how a civic literacy requirement should be implemented. 87% percent of respondents Purdue University should require completion of on- line educational models, 38% percent of respondents felt this requirement should take the form of an on-line examination, 29% felt that students should have to attend three mandatory civic life related events per academic year to fulfill the requirement and lastly, 21% of respondents felt that students should have to pass a civic literacy course. In addition to the surveys, one message that was communicated to the working group by PSG was any requirement should be meaningful educationally. As indicated in the surveys and in the PSG discussion of the issue, few students supported a test-only option. 7 Civics Literacy Initiative Center for C-SPAN Scholarship & Engagement The mission of the Center for C-SPAN Scholarship & Engagement (CCSE) in the Brian Lamb School of Communication is to help faculty and students use the C-SPAN Archives for learning and research. Upon hearing of President Daniels' concern about the level of civic knowledge among students on campus, the Center immediately thought about how the many C-SPAN videos could be used to help students understand the background and workings of the United States government. The CCSE staff routinely makes clips from C-SPAN videos available for Purdue professors and instructors to use in their courses. Creating lessons that utilize C-SPAN videos to illustrate concepts and ideas in American Government seemed a natural extension of this work and a worthwhile initiative for the Center. To lead this initiative, the Lamb School hired Dr. Peter Watkins, a political scientist with thirty years of experience teaching American government, to research and write the learning modules. Collaborating with him are CCSE Managing Director Connie Doebele, who has more than 25 years of experience as a C-SPAN producer, and CCSE Intern and Wilke Scholar Manuel J. Arauz Ramirez. The Center is directed by Dr. Robert Browning who is a jointly-appointed Professor in the Department of Political Science and the Lamb School and is Executive Director of the C-SPAN Archives. Also advising the Center is Dr. Marifran Mattson, Professor and Head of the Brian Lamb School of Communication. A faculty advisory board meets regularly and provides input and guidance on CCSE initiatives. Other Center initiatives include Maymester in Washington, DC, an annual research conference at Purdue, an undergraduate research competition, and an annual interview conducted by Brian Lamb. In total, the CCSE Civics Literacy Initiative there include twelve modules that illustrate concepts in American Government and the Constitution. For example, modules cover topics such as the Declaration of Independence, constitutional functions, voting rights, freedom of speech, civil rights, the Supreme Court, among others. The modules are first being created as podcasts to allow students to listen to a 15-minute narration of the topic supplemented with audio from C- SPAN. Subsequently, the modules will be produced as videos. The modules will be completed by end of Spring semester, 2020. Non-curri cular Events The working group set out to determine existing resources, specifically the types of non- curricular events that are currently offered at Purdue or have been offered that would be appropriate for fulfillment of a graduation requirement in civics literacy. Based on that assessment (which was limited by the ability to search and track events on campus that would meet the requirement) it was determined more resources would be necessary to ensure the number of events offered over the course of an academic year would allow for students to reasonably fulfill that requirement, that those who are sponsoring or hosting the event would be willing and able to accommodate attendance at their event, that a mechanism exists to assess and evaluate the appropriateness of an event, and that there is a way to track and record attendance at an event. 8 Currently, the Division of Diversity and Inclusion is hosting a semester-long series of programming around the theme of 'democracy, civility, and freedom of expression.' https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/purduetoday/releases/2020/Q1/loretta-lynch,-jeff-flake- headline-mlk-events-at-purdue.html There have been other events on campus such as the Condoleeza Rice lecture among others that one may envision among a list of activities of which students could select and participate. Participation in the semester events of this sort may be something we consider as fulfillment of the graduation requirement. Should we do so, this requires a sustained commitment by the University to provide adequate resources and support so that such programming can be successfully offered. Summary of Civics Requirements at Other Institutions Information has been obtained from 20 peer institutions (see below). Nine of the institutions have no requirement with respect to civics. In many cases, civic literacy/ engagement is included as part of the core curriculum. Titles of the requirements include: Title of 'Civics Requirement' University Diversity, Global Citizenship and Intercultural Boston UniversityLiteracy Effective Citizenship Michigan State Citizenship For A Diverse and Just World Ohio State University Civic Engagement Temple Social Responsibility and Ethics U of Kansas Civic Life and Ethics U of Minnesota Ethics and Stewardship U of Nebraska -Lincoln Global Citizenship U.S. Courses U of Tennessee Knoxville American and Texas Government U of Texas -Austin American Cultures, Governance, and History UC -Davis State of Florida's Civic Literacy Requirement U Central Florida For Florida, Texas, and perhaps California, the requirements stem from state law. Among the more recent requirements are Kansas (2013), Florida (2018), and Tennessee and Ohio State this year. The rationale for these recent cases include: Kansas: The rationale for including this was based on the feedback collected from the campus community about what worked and didn't work about the general education program. Additionally, the university had identified as part of the strategic plan a desire to expand the awareness of and engagement with existing high impact practices. Florida is a result of state legislation. In Tennessee and Ohio State, it arose from a revision to their general education requirements. In general, the requirements are part of the general education (core curriculum), and are met by courses. That said, several institutions include non-credit activities such as service learning. Florida's requirement can be met by passing: a. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Naturalization Test - Civics (U.S. history and government) with supplemental questions, minimum score of 60; or 9 b. Advanced Placement Government and Politics: United States, minimum score of 3; or c. Advanced Placement United State History, minimum score of 4; or d. CLEP American Government, minimum score of 50.

Members of the Civics Literacy Working Group (CLWG) presented a proposal to the EPC at the February 11, 2020 meeting to establish a graduation requirement for civics literacy, which reads: Establish a baccalaureate degree requirement for civics literacy. Students would meet the requirement by fulfilling the following: successful completion of a civics literacy exam and completion one of the following three options: 1) 3.0 hours of relevant course work (e.g., relevant introductory course in US politics, public policy, history or other course with civic knowledge content); or 2) successful completion of Center for C-SPAN Scholarship and Engagement modules; or 3) attendance at civics-related Purdue-hosted and -sponsored events involving a substantially equivalent number of contact hours. The EPC minutes for that meeting read: The EPC members had questions as to what the logistics of moving forward with the implementation would look like if the civics literacy recommendations were approved. The EPC members recommended an environmental feasibility study. Cheryl Cooky said that the Working Group would like an opportunity to perform an assessment, come up with resolve for feasibility, and then come back to EPC. Since then, several members from the CLWG--Professors Jay McCann, Phil VanFossen, and Cheryl Cooky, along with Vice Provost Frank Dooley--worked to obtain additional information. This addendum addresses two main questions: 1) academic issues related to the civics literacy requirement, and 2) operational and technical details related to the implementation. Should the Senate pass the resolution to establish a graduation requirement for the baccalaureate degree, we advise the Provost to convene a group of key stakeholders and experts from across campus to work together on the logistics and details. Ideally, this work would commence in the summer 2020 and through the 20-21 AY year with an anticipated 'start date' of fall of 2021 (undergraduate students enrolling at Purdue West Lafayette in fall 2021 will be the first class to have the requirement). Administration Commitment In response to concerns about support from the Administration and resources, Provost Jay Akridge has assured the working group that the necessary resources to implement the graduation requirement will be allocated. Provost Akridge provided the following statement to be included in this report: We appreciate the efforts of the Working Group on Civics Literacy and the graduation requirement that they have proposed. We also respect the desires of the Educational Policy Committee to ensure that resources will be available to support implementation of 11 the graduation requirement. Purdue administration is prepared to ensure that resources will be made available to support implementation of the civics graduation requirement. We recognize that many details are yet to be worked out on the specifics of the requirements, especially the 'events option'. That said, we are confident that we can work together with the University Senate and our faculty to implement this set of graduation requirements in a way that supports the intellectual growth of our students in this important area. The support for this initiative by Purdue administration has been made clear by the President and Board of Trustees on multiple occasions, so there is no question about administrative support for the initiative. Need/Demand A cohort of Purdue first year students is roughly 8,000. Currently, 40 percent of the students would meet the \"plus\" requirement by taking a civics-related course or by bringing AP credit. Of note, Purdue is bound to count AP credit, e.g., the AP credit for political science is equivalent to taking POL 101. We suspect that more students would choose these courses to meet the requirement. If that number were to rise to 60%, roughly 4,800 students would fulfill the requirement via a course, while the other 3,200 students would satisfy the requirement with the non-credit options of the C-SPAN modules or attendance at events. Civics Literacy Test More work is necessary to develop online instrumentation that is psychometrically valid and academically rigorous, in light of the variability in performance across ethnic and US/international groups that was observed in the preliminary BGR survey. The CLWG advises that additional campus experts in Statistics, Psychological Sciences, and/or the College of Education be consulted on the further development of instrumentation. Working group members Phil VanFossen and Jay McCann have expressed willingness to reach out to prospective consultants across campus, who would then constitute an \"Instrumentation Development\" task force under the direction of the Provost. The working group has made progress in this regard earlier this summer/fall (see BRG survey) which can be utilized to inform subsequent survey (test) development. The Provost's Office has ensured that the Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning, Office of the Dean of Students, ITaP and other relevant offices will have support to implement the test and ensure academic integrity. Faculty currently administer exams online. The University will need to establish a mechanism by which the test results can be recorded. This may be in 'webcert' or another platform to be determined by the working group convened by the Provost, pending a Senate vote. Purdue already offers hundreds of on-line courses, manages required training for faculty and staff that is delivered on-line, and regularly implements surveys of undergraduate students. While there will need to be work done on this specific exam, there are no technical barriers to implementing the civics test. In 2018, Florida legislated that all institutions of higher education require a civics test for baccalaureate graduation. The University of Florida, in response, developed an online version of the USCIS 'citizenship test' housed in Canvas (a 12 learning management platform). Preliminary results indicate few issues with this format at the University of Florida. Course Option The following is a list of suggested current courses that could fulfill the curriculum component of the requirement. There are possibly other courses that could also be added to the l ist. A civics literacy requirement could increase enrollments in these course s, with a possible corresponding decrease in enrollments of other UCC courses. We recognize some majors may have fewer degrees of freedom the plan of study, but we are confident students can still meet the 'plus' requirement with transfer/CSPAN/civic events. Moreover, we recommend tracking students to determine if adjustments are needed (for example, if there are disparities in access among students, such as low-income students being at a disadvantage as a result of work requirements preventing the attendance at non-curricular events, or possible differences in the types of students receiving AP credit). Course Title Fulfills UCC for: COM 21000 Debating Public Issues COM 31200 Rhetoric in the Western World COM 41600 United States Politics and the Media COM 46400 American Political Communication HIST 15100 American History To 1877 HIST 15200 United States Since 1877 Humanities HIST 38300 Recent American Constitutional History Humanities and Science, Technology, and Society POL 10100 American Government and Politics Behavioral Social Sciences POL 12000 Introduction to Public Policy and Public Behavioral Social Administration Sciences POL 37300 Campaigns and Elections POL 46100 US Constitutional Law I POL 46200 US Constitutional Law II SCLA Cornerstones in Constitutional Law Behavioral Social 20000 Sciences Senate Document 19-13, which was discussed at the February 17, 2020 University Senate meeting, clarifies the learning outcomes for the five of the foundational outcomes. If approved, the proposal is for Human Cultures - Humanities to meet 4 of 7 possible learning outcomes. Number 7 states \"Identify the history and the basic principles and operation of government in the United States or other countries.\" Similarly, for Human Cultures - Behavioral and Social Sciences, number 6 states, \"Identify examples of how social, behavioral, or historical knowledge informs and can shape personal, civic, ethical, or global decisions and responsibilities.\" Thus, the structure of the core curriculum anticipates courses that would meet a civics literacy requirement. 13 Members of the working group have begun reaching out to the relevant Department Heads. Initial conversations have indicated support for this initiative, and we anticipate cooperation as the civics literacy requirement is implemented. The Deans have received updates of the working group's efforts. At this time, no specific concerns or questions have been raised. The working group report will be shared by the Provost at the Dean's meeting next Wednesday (March 4, 2020). C-SPAN Modules Professor Robert X. Browning confirmed the C-SPAN modules will be available in May 2020. Should the graduation requirement be approved by the Senate, the appropriate office would need to work with the Center for C-SPAN to ensure the distribution of the modules. Again, Purdue already delivers hundreds of on-line courses, so there are no technical barriers to making these course available. Events Options While we have work flows (the IT phrasing for processes) and technology in place to add courses as degree requirements, we only have limited examples of non-credit learning that are included as a degree requirement. That said, we currently can have a certificate that includes non-credit activity that ends up on the academic transcript (e.g., Learning Beyond the Classroom). Purdue will need to determine out how to maintain and attest to the authenticity of the non-credit learning for 3,000 students via C-SPAN and civics-related events. It is important to note that while tracking non-credit activity is somewhat unusual for undergraduates at this time, we do offer a number of non-credit credentials through Purdue Online, so again, there are processes to build on for this specific requirement. Other universities (Michigan State, Pitt) track non-credit graduation requirements. Initial conversations with MSU suggest a non-credit graduation requirement would require: 1. Identification of events. Both MSU and Pitt would say if it is high-stakes, a clearly identified entity responsible for its oversight is needed. This would be managed by Teaching and Learning at Purdue. 2. Attendance at events. Purdue has technologies to swipe or click in. Moving forward, working with ODOS will be necessary to address any integrity concerns. Purdue currently uses IDs to register students, faculty, and staff attending events, so there again, we have starting points for such processes. 3. A record of events attended by student will need to be maintained. 4. We will need to consider whether and how student attendance would be assessed. Technologies: 1. The transcript. This can be done but it will need a workflow to pull in the verified data. 14 2. Tracking. Such software products are available. We currently have a product called Portfolium (and all students already have an account). It would need to be determined whether or not this would be the product used, but it is a starting point. 3. Calendar. The university calendaring is shared between Conferences and Marketing and Media. The tracking of events can be handled. 4. Student facing app. Purdue students expect mobile solutions. App should allow students to determine upcoming events, confirm requirement, etc. Pitt has a very nice app that seems to meet their needs. Something like this could be explored but is not contingent upon moving the graduation requirement ahead. As Provost Akridge noted, \"We recognize that many details are yet to be worked out on the specifics of the requirements, especially the 'events option'.\" Conversations and exploration of similar models at the University of Pittsburgh and Michigan State are underway. Next Steps The student regulations for Degree Requirements, as under consideration by EPC, are: 1. The completion of the requirements of a plan of study, 2. Resident study of at least 32 hours at the 30000 or higher level, 3. A minimum GPA of 2.00, and 4. Completion of the University Core Curriculum. The proposal from the CLWG could either be added as a fifth requirement, or made part of the core curriculum. Advantages of the latter include the existence of a faculty governance structure to oversee the requirement as well as mechanisms in place to assess the effectiveness. At a minimum, a unit in Teaching and Learning will need to be charged with managing the requirement. The resources and personnel needed will be determined by the group convened by the Provost, pending a Senate vote. It is important to note that if the graduation requirement were implemented as soon as Fall 2021, students will have until academic year 2024 (at the earliest) to meet the requirement, providing more than ample opportunity to ensure the requirement is implemented in full, consistent with the wishes of the University Senate. . Recommendation Should the Senate pass the resolution to establish a graduation requirement for the baccalaureate degree, we advise that the Provost convene a group of key stakeholders and experts from across campus to work together on the logistics and details. Ideally, this work would commence in the summer 2020 and through the 20-21 AY year with an anticipated 'start date' of fall of 2021 (undergraduate students enrolling in fall 2021 will be the first class to have the requirement). Again, we have assurances from the Provost that there will be support and infrastructure devoted to implementation (see: Administration Commitment). 15 PURDUE UNIVERSITY , Appendix F PURDUE UNIVERSITY | WEST LAFAYETTE OFFICE ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT March 23, 2020 SAT and ACT Test Use in Admissions UNIVERSITY Test Optional Policies Different types of testing policies Test Required - Purdue's current policy Test Flexible - must submit something academic in place of a test Test Optional - multiple types of formats but generally allow students to chose whether to submit a score or not Test Blind - most common to open admission institutions and those who are not meeting enrollment goals UNIVERSITY Test Optional Arguments PROS & CONS Proponents behind test optional argue Tests have inherent socio-economic bias Eliminating the test requirement will encourage more students to apply Eliminating the test will create equity Test optional will increase the institution's diversity Additional benefits The Law of Artificial Score Inflation: Students not submitting lower test scores will raise the school's U.S. News ranking UNIVERSITY Test Optional Arguments PROS & CONS Proponents for the use of tests Testing agencies continue to conduct validity studies with Universities demonstrating the correlation between the predictive nature of academic performance with HS GPA and test scores When combined with other criteria, the test provide important predictive value Both standardized tests have recently undergone a full test overhaul and College Board has made test preparation resources free through Khan Academy Other items for which the tests are utilized Placement specifically in math courses has been consistently recognized as accurate en Q) L.. ::::J rJ) cu Q) ~ C 0 \u00b7u5 Tests, HSGPA, SAT Tests and HSGPA (N:;;6,784) High School GPA (N=6,784) Average of AP Exam Scores (N=S,742) SAT Tests {N=6.784) SAT Math Section (N=6,784) SAT ERW Section {N=6,784) Number of different AP exams {N:;;6,784) Highest Non-Language SAT Subject Test {N=1,341) Number of Honors or AP courses (N=6.705) Average of Two Highest SAT Subject Tests (N=1,354) Highest of All SAT Subject Tests {N=1,354) Number of activities during high school 0.37 PURDUE UNIVERSITY 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 Predictive Strength (Unsigned Adjusted Correlation) Predictive Strength Strong Moderate Weak Predictive Validity Predictive strength of admissions measures across all applicants and all majors UNIVERSITY Grade Inflation High school grades continue to rise, extending a trend documented throughout the 1990s by the US Department of Education (https://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pu bid=2004455 ).

PURDUE UNIVERSITY , PURDUE UNIVERSITY | WEST LAFAYETTE OFFICE ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT Questions Appendix G The Use of Test Scores in Undergraduate A dmission White Paper Kristina Wong Davis Purdue University Enrollment Management Overview of the admissions environment The test optional movement is not new. Test optional has been around since 1990's (Belasco, et. al. 2015). Regardless of the move to test optional, studies of the institutions that have implemented test optional policies have not demonstrated any significant differences in the demographics o f enrolled students as a result (Belas co et al., 2015). Most recently, there has been a resurgence in the conversation around test optional policies in admissions. As a result a number of institutions have moved to test optional policies for a variety of reasons. Reasons most commonly cited by these institutions are for access, diversity and student success. Institutions like the University of Chicago, who launched a test optional policy in 2018, communicated their intent to broaden the representation of their student body by allowing stu dents to choose to apply with or without a test score. Their already highly selective applicant pool found that a small portion of their pool c hose not to submit test scores. These students, however, had test scores and in almost all cases those scores w ould have made the student eligible for admission (J. Nondorf, personal communication, January 29, 2020) . Additional selective institutions have reported similar behavior in the applicant pools. Test optional applicants, in many cases, have test scores, they simply opt not to submit them. The result then is not a broadening of the applicant pool to include those who have not taken a test, but rather to include applicants who would prefer not to report their scores . There are multiple purposes/incentives for an institution to choose to become test optional. First, some institutions report moving to become test optional in order to diversify their student body. This, as previously stated and shown in multiple research studies does not appear to be realized by many of these institutions. Second, an institution may choose to become test optional in order to eliminate the reporting of scores for students who have lower test scores. As evidenced by research (site here) the greatest effect of test optional policies is that students with lower test scores chose not to submit their scores. If these are not submitted , the school no longer reports those scores thus artificially improving the institution's academic profile and potentially the rankings. U.S. Ne ws allows institutions to report no test scores for up to 25% of the enrolling class before the institution takes a point penalty in the rankings. A recent example of a test optional policy gone awry was documented in the New York Times article The Impossible Math of College Admissions written about Trinity College. Trinity implemented a test optional policy only to discover that the only real way for them to achieve the diversity goals they sought was through engaging with consultants who utilized financial aid optimization in order to refine who was admitted to Trinity. The end result had more to do with consultants and financial aid packaging than the test optional policy. 2 Finally, the most recent reason for an institution implementing new test policies is a result of political pressure on the institution when like peers become test optional. The follow the leader reaction appears to be an ever more emerging trend across all types of institutions. The \"followers\" in many of these cases are doing so less for enrollment goals than for political positioning in a volatile admissions market that has become hostile toward standardized testing in general . It is important to understand that there are a wide variety of test policies being enacted by institutions . The most common is the traditional test optional approach which allows the student to choose whether or not to submit a score when applying. In most cases students are not penalized for not submitting a test score. However, there are institutions now implementing limited test optional policies which prohibits students who apply without a test score from being considered for selective, high -profile majors. Additionally, some institutions like NYU , have moved to the test flexible, which requires a student who chooses not to submit a test score to submit alternate academic or testing evidence. Finally there is the test blind, which means that regardless of whether or not a student submits a test score, it cannot be utilized in the admission s review process. Institutions adopting test blind policies are typically those who are moving toward open enrollment as a means to shore up declining enrollment trends. Northern Illinois University was one of the most recent to announce a test blind policy after multiple years of declining enrollment. As the number of high school students graduating across the U.S. continues to decline, extreme tactics to achieve enrollment will be increasingly common. Some believe that the test optional movement is one to appear more \"friendly\" to families. However, the question remains as to how this might limit an institution's ability to support academic success of the students who do not supply test scores. Furthermore, increasing concerns about equity are developing as a result of the limited test optional policies, which eliminate the opportunity for students to be considered for all majors/programs if they do not submit a test score. The challenge with institutions implementing these policies is that they ar e not transparent. Institutions are not publicly sharing with students what majors/programs are not available to them if they chose to apply test optional. Rather, these are implemented behind the scenes and further disadvantage the same students that th e test optional policy is said to support. Such policies undermine access for students who are not aware of the implications of their choice while in the application process. The subsequent institutional issues that arise from these various test policies are seen in the units working to ensure student success. Standardized test scores, most specifically the math sub -score, is highly predictive of a student's ability to perform in college level calculus. In the absence of a test score, and lacking full understanding of every high school's strength of curricula placing a student and 3 supporting their success becomes increasingly challenging. In the case of l ower rank ing institutions whose aim is to increase applicants and increase enrollment through their test policies, Northern Illinois University as a recent example, may now face retention, persistence and overall student success challenges in the absence of strong academic predictive data. The SAT was long referred to as an aptitude test. However, in recent years the SAT has been completely re-tooled to be an achievement test and has moved away from the terminology and work as an aptitude test. In rebuilding the SAT, the College Board mapped the test to assess those skills most necessary for first ye ar of college success in math, reading and writing skills. Furthermore, the College Board established a relationship with Khan Academy that allows students to take practice SAT exams , follow test prep aration content and upload official SAT and PSAT results into Khan Academy for test help. Khan Academy is free to all students and was part of an effort by the College Board to eliminate high cost, high stakes test preparation as an advantage to high income students. The ACT has also rebuilt the exam and in 2019 announced that they would allow students to retake specific sections of the exam rather than having to retake the entire test. ACT has also acquired a number of entities, aiming the organization to be better at data analytics and supportive use of the test scores beyond admission purposes. Review of test validity Research behind test validity is not new. Both t he College Board and ACT conduct extensive validity studies across all types of participating institutions in an effort to better understand and articulate the nature of the test's predictive ability. Purdue annually participates in validity studies tracking the predictive validity of all admissions measures in combination with test scores and without. As a selective institution with a competitive academic profile, it is critical to Purdue to understand a student's academic ability when enrolling them as a student. The role the test scores play in admissions review is central to making an informed admission decision . There are several ways in which a test score can be utilized in a review of an application for admission. First, if the test score and high school GPA ( HSGPA ) are not discrepant, then the test score, and the sub - scores can be reviewed to support what is understood from high school coursework and performance. Second is if the test score and HSGPA are discrepant. For instance, if the HSGPA is higher and the test score lower by at least one standard deviation, students are more likely to have discrepant performance. A r eviewer must then assess which measure is more indicative of college performance and how will that impact align or not with that student's choice of academic major aspirations. While the SAT and HSGPA independently predict first -year performance, combin ing these measures provides a 15 % boost in predictive power over using HSGPA alone (National SAT validity study). This 4 predictive combination strengthens the use of both HSGPA and test score in the admissions review process. Example: Students from low inc ome school districts with little or no college preparatory coursework, may exhibit high HSGPA. However, the corresponding test score, and sub section scores, may not support the HSGPA evidence. In cases such as this, if this student's academic interests fell into the STEM realm, the math sub -section data from the test would be essential to understanding the student's relative predicted performance in college level calculus. Evidence: HSGPA predictive strength is .58, when SAT (provided through the validity study) is added that rises to .62. While this increase may not appear large at first, as other factors are added as part of the holistic review the overall predictive validity rises to .65. HS GPA alone is a good predictor of success (in this case first year GPA being the definition of success), but when HS GPA is combined with SAT (and possibly other predictors such as number of AP exams), we see additional gains in the predictive strength of the combined measures, indicating that there is value in considering both measures when evaluating students for admission. The reason that there is only a small (0.62 -0.58 = 0.04) gain in predictive strength when you add in SAT scores is partly because of multicollinearity between the two variables. There is some overlapping qualities that the two variables are measuring. ACES Admissions Validity Study for Purdue University (p.9) \"When you look at the graph, you may find that some of the individual measures with str ong correlations do not appear to contribute as much as you might expect to the strength of the prediction when combined with other measures. This is because the measures may overlap with regard to what they are measuring - for example, the HS GPA and the SAT scores measure some, but not all of the same academic abilities.\" 5 (/) ~ :::J (/) (1J w ~ C 0 'iii (/) .E \"Cl <( SAT Tests, HSGPA, Add.

Predictive strength of admissions measures across Engineering applicants In addition to the validity studies conducted by both testing entities, the University of California system recently conducted an in -depth review of the use of test scores in admissions. The review was entirely conducted and authored by faculty across the UC System. The results of their findings resoundingly support the critical need for test scores as an informational element in the review of applications for admission. High School Grade Point Average Furthermore, many studies on the grade inflation across high schools in the US, shed more light on the significant variability that high school GPA might represent in a review of academic credentials (NCES, 2004). As shown below, between 1998 and 2016, wh en SAT scores remained relatively flat, high sch ool GPA, conversely showed a steep increase over time. These steep increases in high school grades are not equitably distributed across all schools. \"From 2005 to 2016, more grade inflation occurred in schools attended by more affluent youngsters than in those attended by the less affluent\" ( Gershenson, 2018, p. 6). 7 --Less Affluent Lowest: O 31 Highest 0.47 C 2.50 ro \"O Q) ~ 2.25 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Year Note: Less affluent schools are defined as those with more than SO percent of students eligible for free or reduced priced lunch; more affluent schools have less than SO percent. Figure 3. HSGPA increases at higher rates in more affluent schools Rampant grade inflation in K-12 is leading to grade compression where by the distribution of grades is narrowing over time. This results in many more students with a 4.0 GPA but also makes an \"A\" gr ade less meaningful. The narrowing distribution diminishes the predictive nature of high school G PA (HSGPA) making it less reliable as an evaluation instrument . (Fordham Inst itute). Therefore, the use of HSGPA and test scores combined is necessary in more accurately predicting a student's first year college GPA. In the absence of test score ev idence inflated HSGPA will over -predict first year performance, leading to incorrec t student placements and potential declines in retention and persistence. Thus, elimination of test scores in the admissions process, and over -reliance on HSGPA could cause even greater inequities for some students. Given that grade inflation is not para llel between more and less resourced schools/families, this will disproportionally advantage already well-resourced students who attend high school where they are savv ier, and have increased the GPA of students over time . Admissions Review and Context The use of test scores in admission review is never utilized to penalize or disadvantage students in any way. Rather, the test scores are an additional quantifiable data element in a comprehensive admission review . Test scores serve to compliment the high school GPA when understanding a student's academic achievement in order to place them for the greatest opportunity for success at Purdue. 8 The holistic review process utilized at Purdue means a comprehensive evaluation is conducted such that that no applications are filtered out of review based on test scores or HSGPA floors. All applications are reviewed fully and assessed for first the eligibility and second for their competitiveness for the selected major. Therefore there is no single factor that determines whether or not a student is offered admission, but rather the evaluation of the entire context of their submitted application documentation which informs that decision. Since SAT and ACT are more measures of achievement (present and f uture) or aptitude to be assessed and GPA is more of a measure of applicant's cumulative effort during high school or the applicant's resilience/persistence (Ralston et al., 2017) , it stands to reason that both are vital at predicting postsecondary succes s. The two metrics are different measures that in combination predict success . Relying solely on one measure would be painting an incomplete picture of the applicant. Not having a complete picture, may be a disadvantage to the applicant if they are unable to succeed at our institution. The 2x2 below shows how these two measures work together to create a more complete picture of the applicant. Figure 4. Measure of effort and achievement as a combination of HSGPA and Test Score GPA (Measure of effort) ---> Overachiever High Achiever Low Achiever Underachiever SAT/ACT (M easure of achievement) ---> 9 Purdue admissions has also begun to incorporate the use of a new tool called Landscape into the evaluation process. The recent creation of Landscape allows reviewers to understand even more deeply the economic divides that happen in our students ' lives. It is not a tool, again, that can ever disadvantage a student. But rather, Landscape provides a view not of the student themselves, but a snap shot of the n eighborhood and school data based on national databases that are publicly available. While not an assessment of a student themselves, it offers a contextual view into the environment in which a student may have undertaken both their personal and academic lives. Due to the fact that context matters, and environments, both school and home, play a role in a student's academic life , Landscape is critical to utilizing any test score provided with a better contextual understanding. EXAMPLE: If a student has provided an SAT total test score of 1190, but the Landscape data shows that the school average total SAT is a 1050, there is a much better understanding of this student's performance relative to their school environment. That is not an end all, be all, measure but this understanding mitigates the incidence of comparing this test score to that of a student in a well-resourced environment with a much higher average total score. Unlike the use of GRE/GMAT in graduate school, there are fewer resources for students to supply to support academic achievement documentation at the undergraduate level . Graduate school applicants are able to supply academic papers, documentation of involvement and productivity in research, as well as references from respected professors which support their application. Undergraduate applicants do not have these same resources nor would they represent the caliber necessary to evaluate a student should like items be incorporated. Furthermore, with nearly 56,000 undergraduate appli cations for admission, reviewing scholarly papers and research studies submitted from students would significantly burden the process and opens the process up for a great deal of subjectivity. Other uses of test scores Some, but not all, scholarships b oth at Purdue and external to Purdue utilize test scores as an academic criteria when awarding scholarship funds. A change in admission criteria which could result in applicants choosing not to submit a test score may also render that applicant in -eligibl e for some scholarships. Additionally, due to the highly predictive nature of the sub -scores of the standardized tests, the math section is frequently utilized for math placement purposes. The absence of standardized test scores would invariably increa se the workload and cost of assessing the math level of incoming students and 10 could also increase the error rate of placements. The potential negative impact on student experience in their first Purdue math course could have multiple ramifications includi ng student satisfaction, persistence and retention. Purdue Retention and Graduation by Test Score The predictive nature of test scores do not end with a student's predicted first year GPA. When assessed across multiple years, it is evident that test sco res are predictive of retention and graduation at Purdue. Table 1. First year Purdue West Lafayette retention rates for students from 2014 through 2018 by SAT and concorded ACT score bands.

This is meaningful not only for the admission process, but also for further understanding which students might benefit from additional academic support early in their academic studies . Diversity in Purdue Undergraduate Enrollment Table 3. Undergraduate Underrepresented Minorities - Applications, Admits and Matrics Applications from underrepresented minorities have increased over time, especially in the years following the adoption of the Common Application (2014 and beyond). From Fall 2014 to Fall 2019, we saw an increase of 2,946 URM applications. That is an increase of 61.9%. During that same time period, there was an increase in admits and matrics, though not always a year over year increase. Admits increased by 1,310 or 56.7% and matrics increased by 283 or 50.4%. It is important to note that the gains in underrepresented (URM) enrollment represent larger increases than the projected demographic increases published by WICHE's Knocking at the College Door (2016). By comparison, WICHE projected an increase of URM high school graduates of 9% for the Midwest and 25% for Indiana (Dashboards, Percent Change in Graduates: https://knocking.wiche.edu/percent -change-in- graduates ). Granted, this is not an apples to apples comparison considering that these were projections based on 2001 to 2013 actuals and this does 12 not consider the quality of those high school graduates \u2014whether they would be admissible to Purdue or not. Nevertheless, an enrollment increase of 50.4% vastly outpaces any projected demographic growth of these same populations. Conclusion When reviewing all of the aspects that surround both the use of standardized tests in admissions and the institutional motivations to develop test optional policies it is evident that it would not benefit Purdue to adopt any related policies that change the use of standardized tests in the admissions process. While propon ents of the movement argue that tests are bad, and that the test preparation industry creates disparities in access, their arguments find weak ground to stand on. With the advent of Khan Academy, free for all students, to prepare for the tests, the emerge nce of Landscape to assess test scores in context, and the increasing inflation of high school GPA's, it seems there are increasingly more arguments in support of the value of test scores than against. Many struggling institutions have moved to test opti onal policies , Purdue is fortunate to have not struggled as so many have to fill the new enrolling class. Although these successes are not a given, all information and resources available must be utilized to continue to help Purdue recruit the best, the b rightest, and the appropriate numbers of students. The horizon of the college admissions recruitment arena will become ever more competitive as struggling institutions become more desperate to fill their seats and maintain financial viability. If the question for Purdue is around increasing diversity, perhaps test optional is not the only avenue to achieve the means. While early in the process, efforts to establish a network of Purdue Polytechnic High Schools throughout the state in underserved areas, could support the construction of a pipeline of students to Purdue that have not previously been in pursuit of four year post - secondary degrees. Furthermore, partnerships such as that which was recently announced between Modern States/Klinsky Foundation and Purdue also aims to reach students with little to no access to college preparatory academic course work and provide them with a pathway to post -secondary studies. These efforts and many more which might yet be on the horizon provide methods to build pipelines of diverse students for Purdue without requiring the institution to implement admissions policies which could have negative impacts once the students arrive. 13 References ACES Admissions Validity Student of Purdue University.
