After all, they're wild fungi! But actually, cordyceps have been in the traditional medicine scene for a long, long time! The first documented use of cordyceps as a natural remedy was in China, where they've been in use for well over 300 years. Cordyceps were (and still are!) known to improve energy, stamina, libido, appetite, and immune defense. In particular, they were mostly used before participating in high-altitude activities \u2014 because they are naturally found in high-altitude areas near the Himalayan mountains! That explains why cordyceps mushrooms promote a higher oxygen uptake. And, of course, more oxygen in the body means more endurance, which leads to better athletic and even sexual performance.* Host Defense Cordyceps energy support supplement may also promote optimal inflammation and antioxidant levels in the body for even more immune system support. There is so much to love. Is it the energy factor that's drawing you in most? We get it.

Serving Size: 2 Capsules Servings Per Container: 30 Ingredients: mycelium/fermented brown rice biomass Other Ingredients: Pullulan (capsule) Host Defense was founded by Paul Stamets, a speaker, author, mycologist, medical researcher, and entrepreneur. He is considered a thought leader in fungi, from habitat to medicinal use and production. He lectures around the world to help deepen people's understanding and respect for the organisms that are literally under our feet, every day of our lives. Host Defense is built on Paul Stamets' visionary research into the power and potential of mushrooms, especially mushroom mycelium, the root-like structures found growing below ground. The power of Host Defense comes from the discovery that the mycelium is the immune system of the mushroom. Just as mycelium helps to support the immune system of humans, it also supports the health and immunity of the natural habitats where it grows. Host Defense's goal is to use the unique properties of mushrooms to help build a healthier world \u2014 and people too. Paul is the author of six books (including Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save The World, Growing Gourmet and Medicinal Mushrooms, and Psilocybin Mushrooms of the World). In his passion for research, he has discovered and named numerous new species of psilocybin mushrooms. He has also received numerous awards, including Invention Ambassador (2014-2015) for the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the National Mycologist Award (2014) from the North American Mycological Association (NAMA), and the Gordon & Tina Wasson Award (2015) from the Mycological Society of America (MSA). Paul funds research to save rare strains of mushrooms that dwell within the old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest. He is a collaborator with numerous scientific organizations and research institutes. Currently, he is testing extracts of these rare strains at the NIH (National Institutes of Health/Virology) and with Washington State University/United States Department of Agriculture against a wide panel of viruses pathogenic to humans, animals, and bees.
