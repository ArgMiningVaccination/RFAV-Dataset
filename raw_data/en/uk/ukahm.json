Valente, MD, FACEP NYS WCB MTG - TBI 6 TABLE OF CONTENT S A. General Guideline Principles ................................ ................................ A.13 Imaging And Of Practice TBI 8 A. GENERAL GUIDELINE PRINCIPLES The principles summarized in this section are key to the intended application of the New York State Medical Treatment Guidelines (MTG) and are applicable to all Workers' Compensation Medical Treatment Guidelines. A.1 Medical Care Medical care and treatment required as a result of a work -related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities with a focus on a return to work, while striving to restore the patient's he alth to its pre -injury status in so far as is feasible. A.2 Rendering Of Medical Services Any medical provider rendering services to a workers' compensation patient must utilize the Treatment Guidelines as provided for with respect to all work -related injuries and/or illnesses. A.3 Positive Patient Response Positive results are defined primarily as functional gains which can be objectively measured. Objective functional gains include, but are not limited to, positional tolerances, range of motion, strength, endurance, activities of daily living (ADL), cognition, psychological behavior, and efficiency/velocity measures which can be quantified. Subjective reports of pain and function may be considered and given relative wei ght when the pain has anatomic and physiologic correlation in proportion to the injury. A.4 Re-Evaluate Treatment If a given treatment or modality is not producing positive results within a well - defined timeframe, the provid er should either modify or discontinue the treatment regime. The provider should evaluate the efficacy of the treatment or modality 2 to 3 weeks after the initial visit and 3 to 4 weeks thereafter. These timeframes may be slightly longer in the context of conditions that are inherently mental health issues, and shorter for other non -musculoskeletal medical conditions (e.g. pulmonary, dermatologic etc.). Recognition that treatment failure is at times attributable to an incorrect diagnosis a failure to respon d should prompt the clinician to reconsider the diagnosis in the event of an unexpected poor response to an otherwise rational intervention. A.5 Education Education of the patient and family, as well as the employer, insurer, policy makers and the community should be a primary emphasis in the treatment of work -related injury or illness. Practitioners should develop and implement effective educational strategies and skills. An education -based paradigm should always start with communicati on providing reassuring information to the patient. No treatment plan is complete without addressing issues of individual and/or NYS WCB MTG - TBI 9 group patient education as a means of facilitating self -management of symptoms and prevention of future injury. Time Frames A.6 Acuity Acute, Subacute and Chronic are generally defined as timeframes for disease stages: Acute - Less than one month Subacute - One to three month s, Chronic - greater than three months. A.7 Initial Evaluation Initial evaluation refers to the acute timeframe following an injury and is not used to define when a given physician first evaluates an injured worker (initial encounter) in an office or clinical setting. A.8 Diagnostic Time Frames Diagnostic time fram es for conducting diagnostic testing commence on the date of injury. Clinical judgment may substantiate the need to accelerate or decelerate the time frames discussed in this document. A.9 Treatment Time Frames Treatment tim e frames for specific interventions commence once treatments have been initiated, not on the date of injury. It is recognized that treatment duration may be impacted by disease process and severity, patient compliance, as well as availability of services. Clinical judgment may substantiate the need to accelerate or decelerate the time frames discussed in this document. A.10 Delayed Recovery For those patients who fail to make expected progress 6 -12 weeks after an injury and whose s ubjective symptoms do not correlate with objective signs and tests, reexamination in order to confirm the accuracy of the diagnosis and re -evaluation of the treatment program should be performed. When addressing a clinical issue that is not inherently a me ntal health issue, assessment for potential barriers to recovery (yellow flags/psychological issues) should be ongoing throughout the care of the patient. At 6 -12 weeks, alternate treatment programs, including formal psychological or psychosocial evaluati on should be considered. Clinicians must be vigilant for any pre -existing mental health issues or subsequent, consequential mental health issues that may be impacting recovery. For issues that are clearly and inherently mental health issues from the outset (i.e. when it is evident that there is an underlying, work -related, mental health disorder as part of the claim at issue), referral to a mental health provider can and should occur much sooner. Referrals to mental health providers for the evaluation and NYS WCB MTG - TBI 10 management of delayed recovery do not indicate or require the establishment of a psychiatric or psychological condition. The evaluation and management of delayed recovery does not require the establishment of a psychiatric or psychological claim. Treatment Approaches A.11 Active Interventions Active interventions emphasizing patient responsibility, such as therapeutic exercise and/or functional treatment, are generally emphasized over passive modalities, especially as treatment progresses. Generally, passive and palliative interventions are vie wed as a means to facilitate progress in an active rehabilitation program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. A.12 Active Therapeutic Exercise Program Active therapeutic exercise program goals should incorporate patient strength, endurance, flexibility, range of motion, sensory integration, coordination, cognition and behavior (when at issue) and education as clinically indicated. This includes functional application in vocational or commu nity settings. A.13 Diagnostic Imaging And Testing Procedures Clinical information obtained by history taking and physical examination should be the basis for selection of imaging procedures and interpretation of results. All diagnostic procedures have c haracteristic specificities and sensitivities for various diagnoses. Usually, selection of one procedure over others depends upon various factors, which may include: relative diagnostic value; risk/benefit profile of the procedure; availability technolo gy; a patient's tolerance; and/or the treating practitioner's familiarity with the procedure. When a diagnostic procedure, in conjunction with clinical information, provides sufficient information to establish an accurate diagnosis, a second diagnostic procedure is not required. However, a subsequent diagnostic procedure including a repeat of the original (same) procedure can be performed, when the specialty physician (e.g. physiatrist, sports medicine physician or other appropriate specialist) radiologist or surgeon documents that the initial study was of inadequate quality to make a diagnosis. Therefore, in such circumstances, a repeat or complementary diagnostic procedure is permissible under the MTG. It is recognized that repeat imaging studies and other tests may be warranted by the clinical course and/or to follow the progress of treatment in some cases. It may be of value to repeat diagnostic procedures (e.g., imaging studies) during the course of c are to reassess or stage the pathology when there is progression of symptoms or findings, prior to surgical interventions and/or therapeutic injections when clinically indicated, and post -operatively to follow the healing NYS WCB MTG - TBI 11 process. Regarding serial imaging, (including x -rays, but particularly CT scans), it must be recognized that repeat procedures result in an increase in cumulative radiation dose and associated risks. A given diagnostic imaging procedure may provide the same or distinctive information as o btained by other procedures. Therefore, prudent choice of procedures(s) for a single diagnostic procedure, a complementary procedure in combination with other procedures(s), or a proper sequential order in multiple procedures will ensure maximum diagnostic accuracy, minimize the likelihood of adverse effect on patients, and promote efficiency by avoiding duplication or redundancy. A.14 Surgical Interventions Consideration of surgery should be within the context of expected functional outcome. The concept of \"cure\" with respect to surgical treatment by itself is generally a misnomer. All operative interventions must be based upon positive correlation of clinical findings, clinical course and imaging and other diagnostic tests. A comprehensive assimilation of these factors must lead to a specific diagnosis with positive identification of pathologic condition(s). For surgery to be performed to treat pain, there must be clear correlation between the pain symptoms and objective evidence of its cause. In all cases, shared decision making with the patient is advised. The patient should be given the opportunity to understand the pros and cons of surgery, potential for rehabilitation as an alternative where applicable, evidence -base d outcomes, and specific surgical experience. A.15 Pre -Authorization All diagnostic imaging, testing procedures, non -surgical and surgical therapeutic procedures, and other therapeutics within the criteria of the Medical Treatmen t Guidelines and based on a correct application of the Medical Treatment Guidelines are considered authorized, with the exception of the procedures listed in section 324.3(1)(a) of Title 12 NYCRR. These are not included on the list of pre-authorized proced ures. Providers who want to perform one of these procedures must request pre -authorization from the carrier before performing the procedure. Second or subsequent procedures (the repeat performance of a surgical procedure due to failure of, or incomplete success from the same surgical procedure performed earlier, if the Medical Treatment Guidelines do not specifically address multiple procedures) also require pre -authorization. NYS WCB MTG - TBI 12 A.16 Psychological/Psychiatric Evaluations In select patients, mental health evaluations are essential to make, secure or confirm a diagnosis. Of course, the extent and duration of evaluations and/or interventions by mental health professionals may vary, particularly based on whether: the underlying clinical issue in the claim is inherently a mental health issue; or there is a mental health issue that is secondary or consequential to the medical injury or illness that is at issue in the claim in question; or there is a pre - existing, unrelated mental health issue that has been made worse by, or is impeding the recovery from (or both) the medical injury or illness that is at issue in the claim in question. Tests of psychological function or psychometric testing, when indicated , can be a valuable component of the psychological evaluation in identifying associated psychological, personality and psychosocial issues. Although these instruments may suggest a diagnosis, neither screening nor psychometric tests are capable of making a diagnosis. The diagnosis should only be made after careful analysis of all available data, including from a thorough history and clinical interview. A professional fluent in the primary language of the patient is strongly preferred. When such a provider is not available, services of a professional language interpreter must be provided. Frequency: When assessing for a pre -existing, unrelated mental health issue that has been made worse by, or is impeding the recovery from (or both) a work - related, medical injury or illness, then a one -time visit for initial psychiatric/psychological encounter should be sufficient, as care would normally be continued by the prior treating provider. If psychometric testing is indicated by findings in the initial encounter, t ime for such testing should not exceed an additional three hours of professional time. For conditions in which a mental health issue is a central part of the initial claim, or in which there is a mental health issue that is secondary or consequential to th e work -related, medical injury or illness, that is part of the claim in question, then more extensive diagnostic and therapeutic interventions may be clinically indicated, and are discussed in detail in the Medical Treatment Guidelines for such mental heal th conditions. A.17 Personality/Psychological/Psychosocial Intervention Following psychosocial evaluation, when intervention is recommended, such intervention should be implemented as soon as possible. This can be used alone or in conjunction with other treatment modalities. For all psychological/psychiatric interventions, there must be an assessment and treatment plan with measurable behavioral goals, time frames and specific interventions pla nned . Time to produce effect: two to eight weeks. NYS WCB MTG - TBI 13 Optimum duration: six weeks to three months. Maximum duration: three to six months. Counseling is not intended to delay but rather to enhance functional recovery. For PTSD Psychological Intervention: Optimum duration three to six months. Maximum duration: nine to twelve months. For select patients, longer supervision and treatment may be required, and if further treatment is indicated, documentation of the nature of the psychological factors, as well as projecting a realistic functional prognosis, should be provided by the authorized treating practitioner every four weeks during the first six months of treatment. For treatment expected to last six to twelve months, such documentation should be provided every four to eight weeks. For long -term treatment beyond twelve months, such documentation should be provided every eight to twelve weeks. All parties should strive for ongoing and continuous communications, in order to fac ilitate seamless, continuous and uninterrupted treatment. A.18 Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) Functional capacity evaluation is a comprehensive or more restricted evaluation of the various aspects of fu nction as they relate to the patient's ability to return to work. Areas such as endurance, lifting (dynamic and static), postural tolerance, specific range -of-motion, coordination and strength, worker habits, employability, as well as psychosocial, cogniti ve, and sensory perceptual aspects of competitive employment may be evaluated. Components of this evaluation may include: (a) musculoskeletal screen; (b) cardiovascular job -specifi tolerance; (f) maximum voluntary effort; (g) pain assessment/psychological screening; (h) non - material and material handling activities; (i) cognitive and behavioral; (j) visual; and (k) sensory perceptual factors. In most cases, the question of whether a patient can return to work can be answered without an FCE. An FCE may be considered at time of MMI, following reasonable prior attempts to return to full duty throughout course of treatment, when the treating physician is unable to make a clear determination on work status on case closure. An FCE is not indicated early during a treatment regime for any reason including one to support a therapeutic plan. NYS WCB MTG - TBI 14 When an FCE is being used to determine return to a specific job site, the treating physician is responsible for understanding and considering the job duties. FCEs cannot be used in isolation to determine work restrictions. The authorized treating physician must interpret the FCE in light of the individual patient's presentation and medic al and personal perceptions. FCEs should not be used as the sole criteria to diagnose malingering. A.19 Return To Work For purposes of these guidelines, return to work is defined as any work or duty that the patient is able to per form safely. It may not be the patient's regular work. Ascertaining a return to work status is part of medical care , and should be included in the treatment and rehabilitation plan. It is normally addressed at every outpatient visit. A description of the patient's status and task limitations is part of any treatment plan and should provide the basis for restriction of work activities when warranted. Early return to work should be a prime goal in treating occupational injuries. The em phasis within these guidelines is to move patients along a continuum of care and return to work, since the prognosis of returning an injured worker to work drops progressively the longer the worker has been out of work. A.20 Job Site Evaluation The treating physician may communicate with the employer or employer's designee, either in person, by video conference, or by telephone, to obtain information regarding the individual or specific demands of the patient's pre - injury job. This may include a description of the exertional demands of the job, the need for repetitive activities, load lifting, static or awkward postures, environmental exposures, psychological stressors and other factors that would pose a barrier to re -entry, r isk of re -injury or disrupt convalescence. When returning to work at the patient's previous job tasks or setting is not feasible, given the clinically determined restrictions on the patient's activities, inquiry should be made about modified duty work sett ings that align with, the patient's condition in view of proposed work activities/demands in modified duty jobs. It should be noted, that under certain circumstances, more than one job site evaluation may be indicated. Ideally, the physician would gain th e most information from an on -site inspection of the job settings and activities; but it is recognized that this may not be feasible in most cases. If job videos/CDs/DVDs are available from the employer, these can contribute valuable information, as can vi deo conferences, conducted from the worksite and ideally workstation or work area. Frequency: one or two c ontacts 1st contact : Patient is in a functional state where the patient can perform some work. 2nd c ontact : Patient has advanced to state where the patient is capable of enhanced functional demands in a work environment. NYS WCB MTG - TBI 15 The physician shall document the conversation. Other A.21 Guideline Recommendations And Medical Evidence The Workers' Compens ation Board and its Medical Advisory Committee have not independently evaluated or vetted the scientific medical literature used in support of the guidelines, but have relied on the methodology used by the developers of various guidelines utilized and refe renced in these Guidelines. A.22 Experimental/Investigational Treatment Medical treatment that is experimental/investigational and not approved for any purpose, application or indication by the FDA is not permitted under these Guidelines. A.23 Injured Workers As Patients In these Guidelines, injured workers are referred to as patients recognizing that in certain circumstances there is no doctor -patient relationship. A.24 Scope Of Practice These Guidelines do not address scope of practice or change the scope of practice. NYS WCB MTG - TBI 16 B. Traumatic Brain Injury Effective: 05/02/2022 B.1 Overview This clinical practice guideline presents recommendatio ns for assessing and treating adults with traumatic brain injury ( TBI). Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is defined as a form of acquired brain injury . It occurs when a sudden trauma causes damage to the brain. Trauma may include any of the following: the head being struck by an object, the head striking an object, the brain undergoing an acceleration/deceleration movement without direct external trauma to the head, a foreign body penetrating the brain, forces generated from events such as a blast or explosion, or other forces. There are three broad acuity categories of TBI. TBI is classified as mild, moderate or severe depending on the extent of the damag e to the brain . Mild TBI is also know n as a concussion. These categories incoprporate the Glasgow Coma Scale which is a neurological scale that provides an objective measure of the conscious state of a person for initial as well as subsequent assessment. Mild TBI - Concussion , includes at least one of : The person was not unconscious or was unconscious for less than 30 minutes. Memory loss lasted less than 24 hours. The GCS was 13 to 15 Moderate TBI, which includes: The person was unconscious for more than 30 minutes and up to 24 hours. Memory loss lasted anywhere from 24 hours to seven days. The GCS was nine to 12. Severe TBI, which includes: The person was unconscious for more than 24 hours. Memory loss lasted more than seven days. The GCS was eight or lower. NYS WCB MTG - TBI 17 Table 1: Classification of TBI Severity If a patient meets criteria in more than one category of severity, the higher severity level is assigned Criteria Mild Moderate Severe Structural Imaging Normal Normal or Abnormal Normal or Abnormal Loss of Consciousness (LOC) 0-30 min >30 min and < 24 hrs > 24 hrs Alteration of Consciousness / Mental State (AOC)* Up to 24 hrs >24 hrs; Severity Based on Other Criteria Posttraumatic Amnesia (PTA) 0-1 day >1 day and <7 days >7 days Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) (Best Available Score in First 24 Hours 13-15 9-12 <9 The Glasgow Coma Scale is a neurological scale that provides an objective measure of the conscious state of a person for initial as well as subsequent assessment it is a meth od for bedside assessment of impairment of conscious level, the clinical hallmark of acute brain injury. Glasgow Coma Scale Response Scale Score Eye Opening Eyes open spontaneously 4 Points Eyes open verbal command, speech or shout 3 Points Eyes open to pain (not applied to face 2 Points No eye opening 1 Point Verbal Response Oriented 5 Points Confused conversation but able to answer questions 4 Points Inappropriate responses but words discernable 3 Points Incomprehensible sounds or speech 2 Points No verbal response 1 Point Motor Response Obeys commands for movement 6 Points Purposeful movement to painful stimulus 5 Points Withdraws from pain 4 Points Abnormal (spastic) flexion, decorticte posture 3 Points Extensor (rigid) response, decebrate posture 2 Points No motor responses 1 Point Adapted from Teasdale G, Jennett B. Assessment of coma and impaired consciousness. Lancet 1974, 81 -84. Alteration of mental status must be immediately related to the head trauma. Typical symptoms would be looking and feeling dazed and uncertain of what is happening, confusion, and difficulty thinking clearly or responding appropriately to mental status ques tions, and being unable to describe events immediately before or after the trauma event . TBI may lead to a wide range of short or long -term issues including but not limited to: Cognitive Function (attention and memory) Motor function (extremity weakness) Sensation (hearing, vision, impaired perception and touch) NYS WCB MTG - TBI 18 Neurologic (headaches, impaired coordination , balance and seizure ) Behavior (emotional regulation, depression, anxiety, aggression, impairments in behavioral control, personality changes) Mild TBI/Concussion is generally relatively benign and self -limited; however, in a small percentage of cases the symptoms persist. While most patients have resolution of symptoms over a period of a few days to a month, some patients may have pers istence of symptoms beyond one year post -injury. Persistent symptoms refer to a variety of physical, cognitive, emotional, behavioral and sleep symptoms that may endure for weeks or months following a concussion . Post -concussion syndrome is a term that is used by many practioners to describe the persistence of a constellation of symptoms beyond the usual recovery period after a concussion. Although initial complaints of impaired memory, attention and executive function are common immediately following mTBI, the vast majority of individuals recover within a few hours to days. However, some p atients report new, persistent or worsening cognitive symptoms weeks, months or sometimes years postinjury. Those who have persistent post - concussion symptoms, may have pre-morbid or comorbid conditions that may play a role in the persistence of the PCS symptoms and this should be considered in the evaluation an d management of post concussive syndrome ., TBI may result in lifetime deficits . As a result , long-term medical management may be indicated . Management and t reatment should be based on the clinical evaluation and revaluation of the medical diagnosis (es) and associated impairment , cognitive ability, anticipated functional gains, and progress demons trated by documented functional outcomes. Management and t reatment may include a cont inum of services ranging from inpatient to outpatient rehabilitation , to supportive living programs , based upon the severity of the TBI and associated impairments . While these guidelines are typically written for care of patients in the ambulatory/outpatient setting, it is recognized that TBI carries with it an increased probability of patients requiring therapeutic interventions, typically delivered in the inpatient hosp ital setting, to be continued in other settings, such as long term care, community or outpatient rehabilitation, or even home care. These guidelines do not capture those interventions, and clinical decision -making regarding such interventions should be ma de on a case -by-case basis, based on the severity of the ongoing symptoms and the resultant type and magnitude of clinical needs, the complexity of which may require a multi -disciplinary approach. Possible TBI Related Symptoms ( list is not all inclusive of TBI related symptoms) Physical Symptoms Cognitive Symptoms Behavioral/Emotional Symptoms Headache, dizziness, balance disorders, nausea, fatigue, sleep disturbance, blurred vision, sensitivity to light, hearing difficulties/loss, tinnitus, sensitivity to noise, seizure, transient neurological abnormalities, numbness, tingling Problems wih attention, concentration, memory, speed of processing, judgement, executive control Depression, anxi ety, agitation, irritability, impulsivity, aggression NYS WCB MTG - TBI 19 B.2 Initial Assessment A thorough history and a focused physical examination guide the initial assessment of a patient complaining of potentially work -related TBI . B.2.a Red Flags The assessment (history and physical exam) should include evaluation for \"Red Flags\" which may raise suspicion of serious underlying medical , neurological (brain, spin al cord, peripheral nerves) and/or orthopedic conditions (see Table 2.) Table 2. Red Flags Disorder Medical History Physical Examination/Diagnostic Testing Increased Intracranial Pressure Altered consciousness, coma Headache History of hypertension Organ -system relevant history features if history of focal intracranial damage or bleeding Altered mental status Altered consciousness Concurrent elevated blood pressure Organ -system relevant physical examination features if history of focal intracranial damage or bleeding Intracerebral hemorrhages Headache Nausea & vomiting Organ -system relevant history features if history of focal intracranial damage or bleeding Altered consciousness Organ -system relevant physical examination features if history of focal intracranial damage or bleeding Central nervous system Impairments Abnormal balance Loss of consciousness Nausea Visual difficulties Organ -system relevant history features if history of focal intracranial damage or bleeding Vertigo lasting for more than seconds Vestibular dysfunction Hearing loss (unilateral) Visual dysfunction Organ -system relevant physical examination features if history of focal intracranial damage or bleeding Fracture Major trauma, such as vehicular accident or fall from height Minor trauma or strenuous lifting in older or potentially osteoporotic patients Metabolic risks for osteopenia (including renal failure, hyperthyroidism, rheumatic disorders, debility and inheritance) Percussion tende rness over specific spinous processes ,examination of the skull, facial bones, cervical spine for focal findings . Careful neurological examination for signs of neurological compromise Substance Abuse with Risk of Withdrawal Substance(s) abuse Prior substance(s) withdrawal Dilated Pupils Tachycardia Sweating Progressive Neurologic Deficit Progressive limb numbness or weakness, bowel or bladder control impairment, gait ataxia Progressive loss in any sensory function (e.g., vision, hearing, balance, se nsation) Severe spine pain Progressive loss in any sensory function (e.g., visual acuity/Snellen, visual fields, audiometry, Romberg, balance, sensation) Significant and progressive myotomal motor weakness Significant and increased sensory loss - in anato mical distribution NYS WCB MTG - ataxia, Babinski limb spasticity, etc.) Other neurological impairment(s) Myelopathy Ataxic gait, impaired upper limb coordination, poor or reduced finger movements, bladder and/or bowel control impairment (incontinence) Hyperreflexia, ataxia, clonus, pathologic reflexes (Babinski, (1746 - 61), Grad 198 9 (281 -4), Szmirnai 2001 (68 -71), Bruce 2001(688 -93), Berger 99 (175 -81), Snyder 93 (253 - 8), Zaki 93 (110 -12), Forsyth 93 (1678 -83), Hiroki 2003 (34 -100), Hong 2003 (210 -14) B.3 Diagnosis B.3.a Medical History and Physical Exam As TBI clinical presentations are so varied, comprehensive medical histories and physical examinations are necessary to assess the patient's TBI. The diagnostic approach needs tailoring to the specific patient, particularly to factors such as the patient's exact mechanism of injury(ies), age, past medical history, underlying medical conditions and prior injury history . A) A medical history encompassing a review of: Current symptoms and health concerns Setting and mechanism of injury Severity/duration of altered consciousness and immediate symptoms Presence of co -occurring injuries Pre-existing medical and mental health conditions Potentially contributing psychosocial factors B) An examination including an assessment of: Mental status and cognition Physical status Cranial nerves Extremity tone, strength and reflexes Gait and balance C) An assessment of the patient's clinical status, including whether there has been improvement of deterioration since the time of injury. This may require additional information from others, including eyewitnesses to the injury. D) Determination of the need for urgent neuroimaging to exclude a more severe brain injury, such as a structural abnormality or hemorrhage. Adapted from the NSW Minstry of Health, Closed Head Injury in Adults - Initial Management (PD2012_013). B.4 Imaging Studies Imag ing studies may support a diagnosis and are not indicated in all patient s. Specific studies include: B.4.a Skull X -Rays Recommended - for the evaluation of TBI patients NYS WCB MTG - TBI 21 Indications - Head trauma thought to be sufficiently forceful to potentially fracture the skull. Indicated as well for further evaluation of bony step -offs and other clinical signs of fracture. Frequency/Dose/Duration - Generally only obtained at presentation. Occasionally re -xrayed at followup. B.4.b Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Recommended - for the evaluation of TBI patients. Indications - Head trauma thought to be sufficiently forceful to potentially cause intracranial hemorrhage, epidural hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage and/or other traumatic brain injury(ies). Subsequent or follow -up MRI studies m ay be indicated for evaluation of ongoing symptoms, or to assess a m issed diagnosis, and/or resolution of prior defects. Frequency/Dose/Duration - Generally only obtained at presentation. Sometimes obtained to evaluate ongoing symptoms to assess a missed or secondary diagnosis. Rationale - MRI is superior to CT for asse ssing intracranial injuries, especially those without hemorrhage . MRIs are helpful in diagnosing surgical emergencies and evaluation of the extent of TBI inju ry(ies) and are thus recommended for evaluating TBI patients. B.4.c Computed Tomography (CT) Recommended - for the evaluation of TBI patients , generally in the emergency room setting to rule out significant anatomical defects Indications - Head trauma thought to be sufficiently forceful to potentially cause cranial fracture, intracranial hemorrhage, brain injury(ies). Frequency/Dose/Duration - Generally only obtained at presentation or at the initial, comprehensive evaluation. MRI is generally preferred for subacute to chronic brain parenchymal evaluation , sometimes obtained to evaluate ongoing symptoms to assess a missed or secondary diagnosis. Rationale - CT is particularly useful for unstable patients with potential need of surgical intervention. CT is not recommended for diagnosis and treatment planning of TBI. B.4.d Vascular Imaging Tests Recommended - for the evaluation of patients with TBI. Indications - Symptoms and/or signs consistent with vascular injury . NYS WCB MTG - TBI 22 Frequency/Dose/Duration - Usually only one assessment is needed. Rationale - Vascular Imaging are selectively recommended for diagnosis of vascular injury associated with TBI. B.5 Other Diagnostic Testing B.5.a Electroencephalography (EEG) Recommended - for the evaluation of seizure risk or seizure syndromes in patients with TBI Indications - Evaluation of seizure -like activity in patients with TBI . Frequency/Dose/Durati on - Generally only one assessment. However, repeat EEG may be indicated in the context of continued seizure like activity, or after a postivie initial EEG , but in the absence of continued seizure activity . Rationale - for diagnosis and management of seizures related to TBI . B.6 Screening / Outcome Measures B.6.a King -Devick (K -D) Recommended - For those employees who might may have a reasonable possibility that they may sustain a head injury (for example, professional contact sports) this tool may provide a useful baseline, and point of reference for subsequent testing. Indications -King-Devick (K -D) is performed as a sideline assessment, and has been used most often in contact sport athletes to enhance the detection of concussion in those with a known baseline measurement. Frequency/Dose/Duration - Pre injury baseline evaluation Then measured after subsequent potential TBI event(s). B.6.b Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) Recommended - For those employees who might may have a reasonable possibility that they may sustain a head injury (for example, professional contact sports) this tool may provide a useful baseline, and point of reference for subsequent testing. Indications -SCAT is perf ormed as a sideline assessmentat, and has been used most often in contact sport athletes to enhance the detection of concussion in those with a known baseline measurement. Frequency/Dose/ Duration - Pre injury baseline evaluation Then measured after subseq uent potential Neuropsychological Assessment Neuropsychology is a specialized branch of psychology that evaluates neurocognitive dysfunction. Neurocognitive dysfunction may be reflected in personality, intelligence, attention, executive function, reasoning, problem solving, information processing, and memory. Cognitive testing generally consists of a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's cognitive status by specific neurologic domains. Neuropsychology occupies a prominent role in the evaluation and treatment of TBI patients, especially moderate and severe patients. In most cases, mild TBI resolves within a few days and thus there is little role for professional evaluation(s) and treatment(s) other than natural recovery. How ever, neuropsychology is also highly helpful in the evaluation of mild TBI patients with persistent symptoms beyond one month. Neuropsychology employs assessments that frequently consist of a thorough clinical and neuropsychological assessment of TBI and v arious types of tests and test batteries to identify abnormalities related to TBI. These tests typically undergo frequent revisions and the most up -to-date version of the tests should be administered. Normally, patients are given a battery of tests in num erous different domains including but not limited to intelligence, memory, executive function, speech, language, visual spatial to assess impacts of, and plan treatment of, TBI patients. It should also be noted that this review is not intended to be all in clusive. Additional tests may be performed as clinically indicated. Selection of specific testing domains is based upon clinical judgement on a case by case basis. B.7.a Neuropsychological and Neurocognitive Assessment Recommended - for the evaluation and treatment of TBI patients. Indications - Moderate or Severe TBI patients experiencing cognitive difficulties. Mild TBI patients with ongoing symptoms are also candidates for neuropsychological assessments. May be performed to help guide treatment, oversee psychological and cognitive -related treat ments and may later be performed as part of an evaluation for end -of-healing , clinical plateau and return to work. Benefits - Identify and measure psychological, neuropsychological, social, behavioral and cognitive capabilities, potentially allowing bet ter tailoring of therapy(ies) to address the specific deficit(s). Frequency/Dose/Duration - Generally, a comprehensive assessment with a battery of tests is performed once or twice assessing numerous different domains including but not limited to , intelligence, memory, executive function, speech, language, visual spatial , processing spee d, mood and personality . Ongoing focused assessments and treatments are then provided targeting deficits or functional issues identifi ed in the assessment. May be used to target specific rehabilitation strategies and then later help determine the extent of residual deficits, if any. NYS WCB MTG - TBI 24 B.8 Vision Overview TBI may create a constellation of vision, oculomotor, and related problems. Oculomo tor problems are prominent with oculomotor -based reading difficulties as the most common symptom in patients with TBI. Additional visual symptoms in a TBI include, but are not limited to: eye -focusing judging distances; diplopia; dizzi ness, vision nausea, increased sensitivity to visual motion, photosensitivity, visual inattention and distractibility and difficulty judging distances (relative and absolute). A MD/DO or OD with appropriate training and experience in TBI related visual disturbances should provide a comprehensive vision evaluation, utilizing standard examination techniques and ancillary tests to establish a diagnosis of visual disorders associated with TBI and develop a treatm ent plan including rehabilitative interventions.

Frequency/Dose/Duration - Generally only assessed once . Other testing B.9.g Swallow Studies Recommended - for select patients experiencing swallowing difficulities or other swallowing related symptoms. Rationale - Swallowing impairment (dysphagia) is common in some severe TBI patients due to prolonged intubation or tracheostomy, the traumatic injury itself, medications or weakened swallowing muscles due to lack of use. These patients may require testing to determine swallow function, ext ent of dysfunction, and adequacy of airway protection. Although there are many different tests they all evaluate the ability of the patient to swallow. The threshold for evaluating swallow studies is low among those with prolonged intubation, tracheostomy, difficulty swallowing or signs of gagging or aspiration.

Evidence for the Use of Substance Abuse Counseling B.13 Medications Treatment of chronic post -traumatic deficits often involves the use of medication. Drug treatment requires clinical assessment, close monitoring of the patient's response to therapy, and ongoing revaluation of treatment. This includes lowering and/or discontinuing medications when symptoms improve and periodic trials of lowering medications when symptoms are stable. NYS WCB MTG - TBI 34 Medications alone are unlikely to provide complete symptom relief. Non- pharmacologic interventions should be used in combinatio n with pharmacologic treatments to minimize the amount of medication necessary in patients with TBI. A primary goal of pharmacologic therapies treatment is to improve the patient's function. Post-traumatic deficits require continuing participation in reha bilitative programs appropriate to and consistent with the level of recovery and techniques such as cognitive rehabilitation, cognitive behavioral therapy, and other individualized physical and psychological practices, as described elsewhere in this guidel ine. If clinically indicated, p rescri ption medications should be given an appropriate trial in order to test for therapeutic effect and tolerance of the medication. The length of an appropriate trial varies widely depending on the drug, as well as the individual and his/her response to the drug. Certain medications (e.g. antidepressants) may take several weeks to months to determine efficacy, while others (e.g. psychostimulants) may require only a few doses Many of the drugs discussed in the medication section are FDA -approved for other indications but may appropriately be used for various aspects of TBI treatment and associated conditions. When pres cribing off -label FDA use of a medication, indications , as well as clinical and functional goals should be clearly stated as part of a comprehensive, functionally -based treatment plan. Patients who sustain a TBI are especially sensitive to central nervo us system side effects, such as sedation, dizziness, cognitive impairment, and motor impairment. Usually, initial doses of medications may need to be lower than normal, and medication doses should be slowly titrated upward as cinically appropriate. A detailed medication history is essential . Numerous medications have potential side effects that may aggravate TBI -related symptoms (or cause TBI -like symptoms) such as headaches, dizziness, vision orhearing changes , fatigue and other symptoms . For examp le, benzodiazepines, tricyclics and anticonvulsants can cause or aggravate dizziness. The temporal relationship to the onset of symptoms and the initiation/dosing of these medications should be evaluated. B.13.a Headaches Headaches are a common physical s ymptom occurring in individuals following T BI (mild, moderate, or severe). The most common patterns of posttraumatic headaches are: (i) tension -type headaches, including a cervicogenic component , and (ii) migraine headaches . The normal recovery from posttraumatic headaches following mild TBI or concussion is usually rapid (hours to days) with most headaches resolving within three months. However, in some cases, headaches may last longer and are referred to as persistent posttraumatic h eadaches . Long -term maintenance plans are necessary in chronic headache management. Medications may be indicated for an indefinite period. NYS WCB MTG - TBI 35 Characterization of the predominant clinical phenotype in posttraumatic headaches is critical to establishing approp riate pharmacologic and non - pharmacologic management strategies . Regardless of the treatment modality, pain treatment is more likely to be successful if the intervention starts at the onset of a headache rather than waiting for the headache pain to escalate. Pharmacologic interventions may be appropriate for treatment of and/or prevention (prophylaxis) of headache s. In the acute phase of management of posttraumatic headaches, narcotic analgesics should be avoided, if possible. Also, special consideration is recommended for the assessment of medication -overuse headaches. Non-pharmacologic management may include educ ation on lifestyle modifications, PT, cervical manipulation , acupuncture and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Prophylactic Treatment Patients who experience more than three tension headaches per week may benefit from prophylactic therapy designed to prevent tension headaches.

However, these results were not statistically significant. \"There was a positive trend showing participants in both the intervention groups to be drinking less frequently and consuming fewer alcoholic drinks than those in the informal discussion (control) group. However, group differences did not reach statistical significance.... Further randomized controlled trials with larger samples are needed to establish whether brief educa tional and motivational interview interventions targeting alcohol use are efficacious in the traumatic brain injury population.\" Data suggest a trend in both intervention groups towards less frequent and fewer drinks over controls.

Statistically significant differences were found in the financial incentive (87%) and barrier reduction (74%) groups compared to the motivational interview (45%) and attention control (45%) groups. Significance indicated through client signing an individualized service plan (ISP) with a counselor within 30 days. Significance also found in fewer number of days to sign (M = 22.8 days, SD = 14.7) , (M = 44.0 days, SD = 35.8) and fewer premature terminations (4%, 6%, 9%, 15%), respectively. \"Participants in the financial incentive and barrier reduction groups were at least 50% more likely to sign the ISP within 30 days compared with the motivational interview and control groups.... Retention in the barrier reduction and financial incentive conditions was 50% greater than in the attention control condition. If these results are replicated, they suggest that the initial intervention sets into motion a series of events that promotes later retention. These findings provide support for Newman's (1997) conception of how engagement in treatment can affect later retention.\" Data suggest financially compensated and barrier reduction groups were more likely to sign on to a substance abuse treatment program post TBI than the motivational interview or attention control groups.
