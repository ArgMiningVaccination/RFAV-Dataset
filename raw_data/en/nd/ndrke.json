Subject will take 3 sniffs of the inhaler four times daily (morning, noon, evening, bedtime) for 7 consecutive days during two chemotherapy cycles. | Other: Ginger aromatherapy | Three sniffs of aromatherapy inhaler four times daily for seven days. | Active Comparator: Orange aromatherpy | Orange essential oil (ORG-114) in an aromatherapy inhaler. Subject will take 3 sniffs of the inhaler four times daily (morning, noon, evening, bedtime) for 7 consecutive days during two chemotherapy cycles. | Other: Orange aromatherapy | Three sniffs of aromatherapy inhaler four times daily for seven days. | Active Comparator: Lavender aromatherapy | Lavender essential oil (LAV-110) in an aromatherapy inhaler. Subject will take 3 sniffs of the inhaler four times daily (morning, noon, evening, bedtime) for 7 consecutive days during two chemotherapy cycles. | Other: Lavender aromatherapy | Three sniffs of aromatherapy inhaler four times daily for seven days. | Placebo Comparator: Jojoba aromatherapy | Jojoba oil in an aromatherapy inhaler. Subject will take 3 sniffs of the inhaler four times daily (morning, noon, evening, bedtime) for 7 consecutive days during two chemotherapy cycles. One drop of jojoba oil is on the other three aromatherapy inhalers. Jojoba oil is a \"carreir oil\" for essential oils which will be used as a comparator and placebo in this study. | Other: Jojoba aromatherapy | Three sniffs of aromatherapy inhaler four times daily for seven days. - Number of participants that complete the intervention. [ Time Frame: 3 months ]Retention rate will be determined by arm. - Compliance rate [ Time Frame: 3 months ]The compliance rate is the percentage of participants that report using the aromatherapy as described in protocol (i.e., at least three sniffs four times daily). - Mean composite severity score [ Time Frame: 3 months ]A composite symptom severity score will be calculated for each day during each Study Cycle. The mean composite symptom severity score will be the mean of all six composite severity scores for each cycle. We will use ANCOVA analyses to compare the maximum composite symptom severity scores and mean composite symptom severity scores between Study Cycle 3 vs Study Cycle 1 and Study Cycle 2 vs. Study Cycle 1. - Maximum composite severity score [ Time Frame: 3 months ]The maximum composite symptom severity score will be the highest severity score across the 6 days for that cycle. The mean composite symptom severity score will be the mean of all six composite severity scores for each cycle. We will use ANCOVA analyses to compare the maximum composite symptom severity scores and mean composite symptom severity scores between Study Cycle 3 vs Study Cycle 1 and Study Cycle 2 vs. Study Cycle 1.

(NOTE: Only non-pregnant females are eligible). University of Rochester will enroll young adults (i.e., 21-39 years) and adults (i.e., 40 years and older). RPCI will enroll adolescents (i.e., 8-20 years) and young adults (i.e., 21-39 years). b) Scheduled to receive two or more cycles of chemotherapy. (NOTE: Subjects may have already started chemotherapy, but must have at least three chemotherapy cycles remaining in their current prescribed course.) c) Day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle must be separated from Day 1 of the next chemotherapy cycle by at least 10 days. d) All cancer types and chemotherapy regimens are eligible. (NOTE: Monoclonal antibody therapies are allowed if administered in combination with chemotherapy). e) The chemotherapy regimen must be the same regimen for all study cycles. For example, if a subject with breast cancer was prescribed TAC for Study Cycle 1, the subject must receive TAC for Study Cycles 2 and 3. f) Any number of chemotherapy administrations per week during a chemotherapy treatment cycle is allowed. g) Subjects must agree to discontinue their current use of aromatherapy for symptom management during the course of the study. They must solely use the jojoba and aromatherapy inhalers provided by the study during the course of the study. h) University of Rochester will enroll subjects who are able to read and understand English or Spanish. RPCI will enroll subjects who are able to read and understand English. All subjects must be able to provide informed consent in order to participate in this study. Exclusion Criteria: - Subjects < 8 years old are not eligible for participation in this study. - Pregnant females are ineligible for the study because pregnancy is a contraindication for chemotherapy and exposure to essentials oils. - Subjects with more than six weeks between chemotherapy treatment cycles are not eligible. - Concurrent radiation therapy or interferon treatment is not allowed. - Subjects with any known allergy to ginger, lavender, orange, citrus of any kind, jojoba, or essential oils are not eligible.
