The medicinal benefits of herbs have been known for centuries, and humans have always been dependent on plants for medicine, food and healing. The healing properties of herbs have not changed through the centuries - what was a healing herb a few hundred years ago is still a healing herb today. The history of herbalism is closely tied to the history of medicine from prehistoric times up until the development of the Germ Theory of Disease in the 19th century. It also overlaps with food history, as many of the herbs and spices historically used by humans to season food yield useful medicinal compounds, and the use of spices with antimicrobial activity in cooking is part of an ancient response to the threat of food-borne pathogens. The ancient Chinese, Indians, Egyptians, Babylonians, Greeks, Romans and Native Americans were all herbalists. Dioscorides (c40-c90) and Galen (131-200 AD), both Greek surgeons in the Roman army, compiled 'herbals' (a book containing the names, descriptions and medicinal uses of plants) that remained the definitive 'materia medica' texts for 1500 years. Through the Middle Ages, herbalism was preserved in the monasteries of Britain and mainland Europe. Before the establishment of universities in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, monasteries served as medical schools. Monks copied and translated many of the works of Hippocrates, Dioscorides, and Galen. Meanwhile, as a result of the Islamic conquest of North Africa in the seventh and eighth centuries, Arabic scholars acquired many Greek and Roman medical texts. Iranian physician Ibn Sina, also known as Avicenna (980-1037 AD), combined the herbal traditions of Dioscorides and Galen with the ancient practices of his own people in 'The Canon of Medicine' (al-Qanun fi at-tibb). One of the most influential medical texts ever written, Avicenna's Canon spread through Europe during the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Modern medicine from the 19th century to today has been based on evidence gathered using the scientific method. Evidence-based use of pharmaceutical drugs, often derived from medicinal plants, has largely replaced herbal treatments in modern health care. However, many people continue to employ various forms of traditional or alternative medicine. These systems often have a significant herbal component. Different cultures have developed different herbal cures. In some countries, such as India and China, herbs have continued to be an important part of medicine over the centuries being widely used in Traditional Ayurveda or Chinese Medicine. However, we are now seeing an increased acceptance of herbal use in Western countries. Knowledge about the power of herbs has only recently started to re-emerge in the West and it is now becoming a popular alternative form of treatment for many conditions. Health Benefits The natural chemical properties of certain herbs have been shown to have medicinal value and are used in some modern drugs. However, unlike conventional medicine, herbalists use the whole herb or plant rather than isolating and breaking down chemical compounds and then synthesising them. This is because the plant, being a part of nature, is said to represent perfect balance. Healing requires the natural combination of elements in the plant or herb, not just a single chemical within it. Every herb has a distinctive flavour, energetic quality, and healing property with a corresponding healing effect on the body. For instance, marshmallow root with its cooling properties is used to treat high fever, rapid pulse, and excess heat in the body; cinnamon bark and dried ginger are known for their warming and stimulating properties.
