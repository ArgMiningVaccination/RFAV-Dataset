Steps to reduce your COVID risk To protect yourself and your loved ones: - Stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccinations. - Stay home if you have cold or flu symptoms and do a RAT. If you need to leave home, wear a mask, avoid crowded spaces and do not visit people who are at higher risk of severe illness. - Wear a mask in high-risk settings. You may be required to wear a mask when visiting hospitals and aged and disability care. - Talk with your doctor now if you are at higher risk of severe illness. Your doctor may recommend a PCR test if you get sick. You may also be eligible for antiviral medicines. - Don't visit people who are at higher risk if you have symptoms or COVID-19. [Find out more on protecting yourself from COVID-19 if you are at higher risk of severe illness.](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/covid-info-high-risk-people.aspx) What should I do if I test positive? You may be infectious for up to 10 days. You are most infectious in the 2 days before your symptoms start and while you have acute symptoms (such as a runny nose, sore throat, fever, cough). Some people with COVID-19 do not develop symptoms at all but are still able to infect others. To reduce the risk to others NSW Health recommends you: - Stay home until your acute symptoms have gone. If you are at [higher risk of severe illness](#_Who_is_at_2), speak with your doctor as soon as you test positive. You may be eligible for [antiviral medicines](https://www.nsw.gov.au/covid-19/management/antivirals)or other treatments for COVID-19. Antiviral medicines work best when used as soon as symptoms start. - Don't visit people at [high risk of severe illness](#severe), anyone in hospital or an aged or disability care facility for at least 7 days. - Wear a mask when indoors and on public transport, if you must leave your home. - Avoid large gatherings and indoor crowded places, especially where you will be in contact with groups of people you don't live with. - Talk to your employer about when you should return to the workplace. You should talk to your workplace about working from home, where possible. If you work in a high-risk setting such as health, disability and aged care, it is recommended that you stay away from the workplace for at least 7 days and until you have no symptoms to help protect other staff, patients, residents, and clients. If your employer needs you to return to the workplace before this time, they may ask you to take additional steps to protect others, subject to their work, health and safety assessment. - Tell people that you live with, or spend a lot of time with, that you have COVID-19. People you live with or spend a lot of time indoors with are at greatest risk of catching COVID-19 from you. You should tell them you have tested positive and try to separate from them as much as possible. They should test regularly and monitor for symptoms. If they get sick, they should get tested and stay home. They should follow the [Information for people exposed to COVID-19 fact sheet](https://www.nsw.gov.au/covid-19/management/people-exposed-to-covid). - Register your positive rapid antigen test result with [Service NSW](https://www.nsw.gov.au/covid-19/stay-safe/testing/register-positive-rat-test-result). If you or someone in your family can't register online, please call Service NSW on 13 77 88. Registering your result helps you access medical support from NSW Health, including antiviral medicines if you are eligible, and also assists NSW Health respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This keeps you, your loved ones and the community safe. If you tested positive on a PCR test, you do not need to register your result. How should I manage my symptoms?

When caring for your child with COVID-19 at home: - Dress your child in appropriate clothing, so that they are comfortable - not sweating or shivering - Give your child plenty of fluids to drink. They may not feel like drinking much so will need your help and encouragement - Check if your baby seems to want more frequent breast or formula feeds. Breastfeeding is safe to continue if you and/or your baby has COVID-19 - Encourage them to rest and not overdo it - Use paracetamol or ibuprofen, only if you think your child is in pain or appears uncomfortable with a fever. Follow the instructions on the label. Only give the recommended dose in a 24-hour period otherwise this may be harmful for children. Monitor your child's symptoms.

If you are concerned your child is seriously unwell, has difficulty breathing, is severely dehydrated or fainting, call Triple Zero (000) immediately and tell the operator your child has COVID-19. How can I protect other people I live with? If you live with other people, it is strongly recommended you stay separated from them until your acute symptoms (such as runny nose, sore throat, cough, fever) have gone. There are simple steps you can take to help prevent the virus spreading through your household. Physically distance This means: - staying and sleeping in a separate room - using a separate bathroom if available - not being in the same room as another person. Practise good hygiene - Wash your hands with soap and water frequently or use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser - Cover coughs and sneezes - Wear a mask in shared areas or when caring for other members of your household - Take extra care to remain separate from any members of your household who are at [higher risk of severe illness](#severe), including people who are elderly, immunocompromised or have medical conditions such as heart, lung or kidney problems. How do I protect other people if I live in a multi unit dwelling (eg. apartment building or hotel)? If you live in an apartment building or you are staying in a hotel while unwell, it is recommended that you: - Remain inside your own unit/room as much as possible. Avoid shared laundry facilities or any other common areas such as a gym, pool or shared outdoor area - Wear a mask any time you leave the apartment/room - Open windows if possible/safe to maximise fresh air and natural ventilation - Ask for any deliveries, including food, to be left outside your door. It is advised not to open the door until the delivery person has left and the corridor is empty to protect the delivery person. What if I have shared care arrangements? - Moving between households, even for shared caring arrangements, is not recommended while you are sick. You should only move to another household after your acute symptoms have gone. How soon should I get vaccinated after having COVID-19? You should follow the [latest guidance from Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI)](https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/covid-19-vaccines/advice-for-providers/clinical-guidance/clinical-recommendations) to determine when you should receive your next vaccination.

If you are at a [higher risk of severe illness](#_Who_is_at_1) and have symptoms, speak to your doctor about further testing. If you come into contact with someone with COVID-19 more than 4 weeks after your acute symptoms have gone, it is recommended you follow the advice in the [Information for people exposed to COVID-19](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/people-exposed-to-covid.aspx) and [What COVID-19 test should I do](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/get-tested-for-covid-19.aspx)? fact sheets.
