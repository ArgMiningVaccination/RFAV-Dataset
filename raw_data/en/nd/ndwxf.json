Accepted May 16, 2003 ) SUMMARY : To assess the causal association of autism with measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine versus and rubella immunization, a 1:2 sex-adjusted logistic regression analysis was conducted using data on subjects who were growing up in the Tokyo area between 1988 and 1992. When MMR immunization was used as a reference, monovalent measles immunization (odds ratio [OR] = 5.33,99% confidence CI: 1.30-56.4) with development of autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) were significantly increased. These results suggest a decreased risk of developing ASD with MMR compared tomonovalent antigens. However, our findings may reflect potential selection bias due to requiring written consent, possible delayed vaccination in suspected autism cases, and small sample size (case = 21). For the case group and the control group, immunization completeness rate of each antigen, regardless of the timing of immunization,was 90.5% versus 100% in measles, 83.3% < 0.01), 14.3% versus in 90.5% in polio2, 100% versus 97.6% in Diphtheria (D), pertussis, and tetanus (T) 3, 85.7% versus 66.7% in DT, 95.2% versus 92.9% in Japanese encephalitis 3 ( P<0.01). Only two case subjects and four control subjects received their measles, mumps, and rubella immunizations separately, suggesting that few Japanese parents might have had concerns about the safety of MMR vaccine. A nation-wide study would be a practical measure toscientifically judge the safety of MMR and other routine childhood immunizations.Jpn. J. Infect. Dis., 56, 114-117, 2003 *Corresponding author: Mailing address: Institute for International Cooperation, Japan International Cooperation Agency, Ichigaya- autism with special attention to infection/ immunization has been vigorously discussed. Wakefield andcolleagues speculated that persistent measles virus infection of the gastrointestinal tract could have resulted in ileocolonic lymphonodular hyperplasia that allowed gastrointestinalabsorption of toxic neuropeptides, which then caused central nervous system damage followed by neurodevelopmental regression (1). The authors hypothesized that combinedmeasles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine might cause autism, and recommended alternative use of a monovalent measles vaccine. However, to date, no published report hassupported their hypothesis (2). The Japanese mother-child health law (article 12) regu- lates that all children are to receive a health check including aneurodevelopment assessment by their local health authority at least twice, once between the ages of 12 and 23 months and again around 3 to 4 years of age. Development andimmunization history are recorded in \"Boshitecho\", the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) handbook. From 1989 to 1993, MMR vaccine sold on market contained AIK-C (measles), Urabe AM9 (mumps),and with AIK-C, Schwarz FF8, TD97, or the Tanabe CAM strain was simultaneously in use in the Japa- nese national childhood immunization program. We consid- ered that if the immunization data of autistic children's MCH handbook were available, the data on children who were born during that period constitute a good birth cohort for analysisof vaccine implications (3). Causal association of autism with immunization can be assessed in terms of immunization history. When the catchment areas of the case and the controlpopulations, respectively, are geographically matched, any possible bias involving environmental factors would be mini- mized. This paper summarizes immunization trends and the results of a case-control study of autistic children who were growing up in the Tokyo area from 1988 to 1992, with specialattention to the causal association between autism and MMR/ monovalent measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines, respec- tively. METHODS During the period from 1989 to 1993, the Japanese national immunization program recommended MMR vaccine or monovalent measles vaccination be given at the age of 12months, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine at 2, 4, and 6 months old, oral polio vaccine (OPV) at 3 and 9 months, and BCG at 3 months. Monovalent mumps and rubellavaccine remained optional for those who did not receive MMR115vaccination. Diphtheria-tetanus toxoid (DT) was given at 12 years of age, and Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine wasadministered 3 times between 3 and 4 years. The Tokyo Metropolitan Umegaoka Hospital is a specialized pediatric psychiatry facility in the Tokyo area. Approximately130 school-aged children visit the hospital for treatment of and care for autistic spectrum disorders (ASD). From July 2001 to February 2002, the attending physicians of thehospital requested that the caregivers of ASD patients born between 1988 and 1992 disclose the patients' clinical records. After the caregivers had received an explanation of the study'spurposes, they gave their written informed consent to release the records. Subsequently, year of birth, age at initial onset of autistic symptoms, age of diagnosis according to the ICD10code, and family history of ASD were reviewed. The infantile autistic symptoms were defined using the criteria of the hospital (Table 1). Diagnosis was made based on the defini-tion set out in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV). Immunization records including vaccination date, vaccine type, lot number,provider's name, and adverse events and any unusual episodes, if any, were collected from the MCH handbooks. A sex-adjusted logistic regression analysis was planned. If immunization was given after ASD diagnosis, those cases were regarded as non-vaccination in each relevant antigen setting. The control group was selected from the same birthyear cohort (approximately 1,700 children born between 1988 and 1992), of children who were attending one of the two pediatric clinics in Tokyo. Using a randomized table (Fisherand Yates 1974), the eligible boys and girls were selected by their last two-digit registration number, and among those selected, only those who had no neuropsychiatric disordersand whose guardians had consented to disclosure of the MCH hsandbook data were enrolled in the control population. Forboth males and females, this process was repeated until the sample size for the control reached twice as those of the case. Using MMR immunization as a reference, odds ratios (OR) with a 99% confidence interval (CI) for development of ASD were calculated for each immunization antigen setting (i.e., immunization with monovalent vaccine or non-immunizationfor measles, mumps, and rubella antigens). The data were summarized by using Micorosoft Excel (Microsoft Japan Co., LTD, Tokyo), then analyzed using SPSS ver.11.5J (SPSS Co., LTD, Tokyo). RESULTS Case and control selection : A total of 21 autistic children were enrolled in the case-control study (Table 2). Responserate with informed consent was 87.5% (21/24). Among those 21 cases, four (19%) were female, which ratio corresponded to the previously reported sex ratio in Japan (male:female =3-4:1) (4). Distribution of birth year was as follows: 1 in 1988, 2 in 1989, 3 in 1990, 9 in 1991, and 6 in 1992. Two cases were diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome (ICD1084.5). One case (No. 13) had a regressive clinical course (i.e., history of loss of verbal expression at 18 months of age). The average age at which the initial autistic symptom appearedand diagnosis was made 2.46 years (median = 2 years, stand- ard deviation = 1.65 years) and 6.57 years (median = 5 years, standard deviation = 2.79 years), respectively. For the control matching, 8 females and 34 males were selected, based on a response rate of 58% (42/72). Distribu- tion of birth year was as follows: 26 in 1988, 9 in 1989, 2 in1990, 4 in 1991, and 1 in 1992. Measles antigens given to the case and control groups included: AIK-C (case = 9, control = 30), Schwarz FF8 (case = 5, control = 7), TD97 (case = 2, control = 2), Tanabe CAM(case = 1, control =2), and unknown (case = 3, control = 1).

Immunization records : For the case group versus the control group, immunization completeness rate of each antigen, regardless of timing of immunization, was 90.5%versus 100% in measles, 42.9% versus < 0.01), varicella ( P < 0.01), 100% 90.5% polio 100% versus 97.6% in 3, versus 92.9% BCG, and 52.4% versus 81.0% in JE 3 ( P < 0.01). No adverse events or unusual episodes were recorded after immunization. The Tokyo Metropolitan Annual Report of Hygiene summarized the estimated rate with standard deviation for each antigen during the \u00b1 5.72% (JE) (Table 3). Statistical analysis : A total of four shots (i.e., one mumps and three rubella immunizations) were given after ASD diagnosis; in this study, this was regarded as non-vaccina-tion. Among subjects in the control group, all had received either MMR vaccine or monovalent measles vaccine; therefore, the OR for measles antigen was immeasurable. When MMRimmunization was regarded as a reference, monovalent measles immunization (OR = 5.33, 99% (OR = 8.57, 99% CI: 1.30-56.4), respectively, to development of ASD was significantly increased. All the other associations were statistically non- significant (Table 4).DISCUSSIONS This is the first epidemiological study to analyze the causal association between routine immunization history and Japa- nese autism. The results of this study contradicted the hypothesis by Wakefield's group, and allayed concerns about the reintroduc- tion of MMR to the Japanese immunization schedule.However, the statistically significant association of ASD with monovalent measles immunization, non-mumps, and non- rubella immunization might be exaggerated in our study, dueto the small sample size and possible bias due to the informed consent process; in both the case group and the control group, the informed consent process might have discouragedcaregivers from enrolling children with a poor or incomplete immunization history. For instance, mumps and rubella immunization were to be given after the age of 12 months,and whether these immunizations were obtained during the observation years was the parent's or caregiver's choice. The difference in immunization completeness rates between thecase group and the control group ( P < 0.01) could be explained that the case group caregivers were satisfied with the minimal required antigens, especially after they became aware of thechild's abnormal autistic symptoms, whereas the control group parents wished to have their children receive the maximum antigens available via MMR immunization, and these circum-stances created a possible bias in this study. The relatively poor response rate (58%) of the control population presents another possible bias, though the estimated immunization ratefor the general Tokyo population during the same time period was similar to that of the control group. The measles immunization rate is exceptionally lower among the Tokyopopulation, probably because many healthy infants might havebeen infected naturally before the age of 12 months. The immunization rates for mumps and varicella were not available, because these immunizations were optional. In the United States, the vaccine safety data link project revealed that the vaccination rate begins to fall off signifi- cantly for neurologically abnormal children right around theage of 12-15 months (Dr. Robert Davis, personal communica- tion, October 31, 2002). In fact, the immunization completeness rate of JE, which is given 3 times between the ages of 3 and 4was 52.4% in the case group, and 81.0% in the control group (P < 0.01). Of 17 JE-immunized subjects in the case group, only five received JE immunizations after ASD diagnosis.Such a clearly intentional delay in immunization could present another bias. The presence of such a trend in the infantile period would suggest that immunization with MMR appearedless attractive after the second year of life, and many have been acti vely withheld due to either the caregivers' or the physicians' concerns. However, this study demonstrated thatonly two case subjects and four control subjects received all measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines separately, suggesting that few parents had special concerns about the safety of MMRvaccine. The causal-effect association, i.e., the timing of the initial onset of autistic symptoms relative to that of immunization,is a crucial focus of this study. Diagnosis of ASD using DSM- IV criteria is often difficult at the infantile stage. Some researchers argue that autism has a strong genetic componentand that the associated neurological defects probably occur early in the course of embryonic development (5, 6). In most cases, abnormal symptoms are present at birth, although au-tism migth not be diagnosed until later in life when communi-Table 4.

If this is the case, the effect of immunization wouldcontribute little more than some modification to a congenital disorder. If regressive autism occurs in conjunction with one or more congenital abnormalities (5), analysis of biologicalplausibility, consistency, and strength of the association would be greatly complicated. A population-based study using a rigorous case series meth- odology is one way to assess the relative incidence of autism within predifined time periods (8). However, such a study should address the loss of subjects to follow up over a longtime period. A study design with a shorter observation period should address potential confounding factor of normal children with temporary symptoms. For example, it isnoteworthy that infants with autism-like symptoms often resume normal development after 1 year of age. In conclusion, the former Japanese MMR and other immunizations have demonstrated no harmful causal associa- tion with ASD in Japanese children. A nation-wide study would be a practical measure to scientifically confirm thesafety of MMR and other routine childhood immunizations. REFERENCES 1.Wakefield, A.
