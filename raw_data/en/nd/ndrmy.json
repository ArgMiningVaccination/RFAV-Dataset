Children 6 months to 4 years of age who are moderately to severely immunocompromised and who receive the Pfizer vaccine are recommended 4 doses as part of their initial series. A third dose is for people with compromised immune systems who don't develop a strong enough immune response with two doses and need a third dose to be better protected against COVID-19. If you are someone who is clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) and received a three-dose initial COVID-19 vaccine series, you can get an updated COVID-19 vaccine when the next vaccination campaign launches this fall if you meet the age eligibility and it has been at least 6 months since your last dose. Call 1-833-838-2323 if you are eligible and have not yet received an invitation to book one. There is information available about planning your vaccine for people who are considered clinically extremely vulnerable. "}
