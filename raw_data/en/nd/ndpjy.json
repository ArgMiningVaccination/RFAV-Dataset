It operates a national healer referral service to put members of the public seeking spiritual healing in touch with approved \"healer members\" of the federation. Since 1965 (under an agreement with more than 1,500 [National Health Service](/history/modern-europe/british-and-irish-history/national-health-service) Hospitals), NFSH healer members may attend to those hospitalized patients who request the services of a healer. An important development took place in 1977, when the General Medical Council in [England](/places/britain-ireland-france-and-low-countries/british-and-irish-political-geography/england) agreed to allow doctors to recommend spiritual healing to their patients. The federation has approximately 6,500 members and may be contacted at Old Manor Farm Studio, Church St., Sunburyon-Thames, Middlesex, TW16 6RG, England.
