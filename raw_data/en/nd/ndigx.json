Prepare yourself for this straight to the point \"health memoir,\" as it contains no fluffy distractions typical of most books in the self-help genre. This book challenges readers to open their eyes to health consciousness, to a certain degree Millions use natural cures for almost everything, but when it comes to the psyche, we are left with only crystals and \"chemicals\" to choose from. Nursing student turned whistle blowing naturopath, Aurore Henze, goes no holds barred in this intimate and thought-provoking health, autobiography. The 2021 updated editions share important lessons learned along the way, \"Auroreveda,\" orgonomic yoga therapy, alternative drug choices, breakthroughs in holistic dental care and recovery from PTSD. \"Real body-mind health is about understanding how our bodies are programmed throughout early childhood and learning effective skills to treat trauma that has solidified in our body in the form of disease but has also escaped our consciousness. Until now, we have been fed half-lies, pseudo-cures and chemicals to subdue and entertain, NOT heal. I challenge the current healthcare status quo by demanding higher standards and a chance to heal- should we want to.\" - Aurore Henze, 2021 In 2012, Aurore's work in Women's health, c-section and homebirth, was cited in the National Library of Medicine- pubmed.gov.
