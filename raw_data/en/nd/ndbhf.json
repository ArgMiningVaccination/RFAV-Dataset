The purpose of this dissertation is to quantitatively evaluate the asso ciations between perceived ac cess barriers to conventional medicine and CAM usage using population data. Method: This is a cross-sectional study using the 1999 and 2002 National Health Interview Survey. The target population is U.S. civilians age 18 to 64. The outcome variable is CAM usage classified into ho mogenous subgroups. Perceived access barriers to conventional medicine are grouped into distinct dimensions including affordability, accommodation, or accessibility. To deal with potential selection problems related to perceived access barriers to conventional medi cine, recursive bivariate probit models are utilized to test the impact of individual perceived acce ss barriers on CAM usage after controlling confounders. Moreover, multivariate probit and Boolean probit models are used to evaluate all three distinct percei ved access barrier dimensions simultaneously on CAM usage. Results: In general, perceived a ccess barriers to conventiona l medicine are positively related to CAM usage, to varying degrees . The various relationships found in this dissertation between each perceived access barr iers to conventional medicine and CAM subgroup usage show a clear picture that neither perceived access barriers to conventional medicine nor CAM is homogenous. Moreover, several bivariate probit models are significant, indicating that perceived access barriers to conventional medicine are ivendogenous in these models. It can be seen from model comparison that serious biases arise from simple probit models when th ese variables of interest are endogenous. Furthermore, the impact of three perceived access barrier dimensi ons on CAM use differs in multivariate probit and Boolean probit models, each of which has its assumptions, as such strengths and limitations. Conclusions: Ignoring the endogenous nature of perceived access barriers to conventional medicine will bias estimates of the relationships between perceived access barriers to conventional medi cine and CAM usage. People who perceive access barriers are likely to use CAM, esp ecially perceived accommodati on access barriers. These access barriers should be addressed to ensure that people have adequate ac cess to health care services, both conventional and altern ative, to improve their health. vTABLE OF CONTENTS CHAPTER

It is hypothesized that perceived access barriers to conventional medici ne will increase the use of CAM. Terms used in this dissertation are conventional medicine and CAM. CAM represents complementary and alternative medicine, altern ative medicine, unconventiona l medicine, or unconventional therapies while conventional me dicine represents conventiona l health care, conventional therapy, orthodox medicine, west ern medicine, or modern medicine mentioned in the literature. To ensure consistency, only th e terms CAM and conven tional medicine are used in this dissertation. Background of the Study A systematic review of CAM usage, which has been widely documented in both developing and developed countries (Ernst , 2000; Hendrickson, Zollinger, & McCleary, 2006; Molassiotis et al., 2005), re vealed that such usage ranges from 9 to 65% worldwide (Ernst, 2000). However, modern western medi cine (termed conventional medicine in the West) is in some sense an alternative medi cine for people in developing countries in which traditional medical care, considered CA M in western countries, is actually more conventional. Nevertheless, w ithout sufficient biomedical ev idence-based research to support its efficacy, many people consider CAM inferior or unsafe. In spite of this Access Barriers and CAM Yu 2concern, interest in and use of CAM continue s to grow rapidly bot h around the world and in the United States. In the United States, visits to alternative medicine practitioners and total expenditures for alternative medicine incr eased significantly during the 1990s. For example, Eisenberg et al. (1998) found that the total number of visits to alternative medicine practitioners by the adult populat ion increased almost 50%, from 427 million in 1990 to 629 million in 1997, including a noteworthy 400% increase in the use of herbal medicine. In both years, the estimated total number of visits to alternative medicine practitioners even exceeded the total projected visits to al l primary care physicians by 40 million in 1990 and a notable 243 million in 1997. In Eisenberg et al.'s (1998) conservati ve estimation, the to tal expenditures for alternative medicine practi tioners, exclusive of infla tion, increased nearly 45% throughout the 1990 to 1997 period. Indeed, in 1997, the estimated annual out-of-pocket expenditures for alternative medicine even exceeded the out-of-pocket expenditures for all U.S. hospitalization. Moreover, insuran ce coverage for CAM increased during this period, possibly resulting in the lower proportion of alternative medicine costs paid out of pocket. Namely, an increase in the total e xpenditures for CAM may have resulted partly from increasing health insurance coverage for CAM in the 1990s. A more recent study by Kessler et al. (2001) found that nearly 70% of the population had used CAM at least once in thei r lifetime; specifically, almost 50% of the population who had ever used CAM engaged in persistent CAM usage (i.e., usage that continued over many years). Indeed, CAM can be used not only for treatment but also for Access Barriers and CAM Yu 3health promotion or disease prevention. In 1990, one third of alternative medicine users used it for disease prevention or health prom otion, a number that increased to nearly 60% in 1997 (Eisenberg et al., 1998). Not only was the prevalence of CAM usage even higher (66%) among subpopulations like rheumato logy and geriatric patients (Anderson, Shane-McWhorter, Crouch, & Andersen, 2000) , but approximately half of elderly persons used CAM for general health improve ment (Astin, Pelletier, Marie, & Haskell, 2000). Despite controversy in biomedical journals about the efficacy and effectiveness of CAM, research has suggested that CAM us ers are likely to perceive CAM as safe (Anderson et al., 2000), more effective (F urnham & Bond, 2000), and more helpful than conventional medicine, especially for chroni c debilitating conditions like headaches and neck and back conditions (Eisenberg et al., 2001). Moreover, the majority of CAM users (around 90%) cited added benefits as a reas on for use (Anderson et al., 2000; Shahrokh, Lukaszuk, & Prawitz, 2005). In fact, 80% of CAM users in the Astin et al. (2000) study reported receiving substantial benefits from CAM usage. To meet this undeniable trend and de mand, in fiscal year 1999, the National Center for Complementary and Alterna tive Medicine (NCCAM) was established1 as one of 27 institutes and centers at the National In stitutes of Health (N IH). NCCAM (n.d.) is responsible for \"the conduct and support of basic and a pplied research ... research training, the dissemination of health inform ation, and other programs with respect to identifying, investigating, and validating co mplementary and alternative treatment, 1 According to Public Law 105-277 (http://nccam.nih.gov/about/plans/2005/index.htm). Access Barriers and CAM Yu 4diagnostic and prevention modalities, disciplines and systems.\" One of four major criteria for research priority in NCCAM's initial re search agenda was CAM usage by the U.S. public (Nahin, 2005). This dissertati on contributes to this area of interest by exploring the impact of perceived access barriers to c onventional medicine on CAM utilization to further understand the reasons for CAM use by the U.S. public. Reasons for CAM Usage The reasons for CAM usage have long been of interest to many researchers in diverse fields, whose various explanations can be roughly categor ized into either preference for alternative medicine or di ssatisfaction with conventional medicine. However, it has also been argued that choice of modalities to treat a special health problem, whether conventional or alternative, is multi- rather than one-dimensional and cannot be solely explained by either prefer ence or dissatisfaction (Kelner & Wellman, 1997). Dissatisfaction with Conventional Medicine Research findings regarding dissatisfac tion with conventional medicine and CAM usage are equivocal. Many studies support a positive relationship between these two variables. Higginbotham, Trevino, and Ray ( 1990) found that, independent of ability to pay, Mexican Americans who preferred to be interviewed in Spanish and expressed dissatisfaction with conventional me dicine were more likely to use curanderos (traditional folk healers in Hispanic-America) . Nevertheless, the authors argued that such Access Barriers and CAM Yu 5dissatisfaction with conventional medicine could also result from difficulty communicating with the mostly English-speaking conven tional medicine providers. Subsequently, Furnham and Bhagrath (1993) reported that homeopathic users were significantly less satisfied w ith conventional medicine. Fu rnham and Forey (1994) found that alternative therapy users gave genera l practitioner significantly lower scores on listening to what they had to say than did the general prac titioners' patients, and that CAM users were critical of and skeptical about the efficacy of modern medicine. Similarly, Applewhite (1995) found that el derly Mexican Americans might use folk medicine because of dissatisfaction with m odern medical care. In a study in Ottawa, Canada, Sirois and Gick (2002) also reported dissatisfaction with medical doctors to be associated with CAM usage. Shahrokh et al. (2005) found that the el derly users of herb supplements in Illinois were more likely to be dissatisfied with conventional medicine and to perceive supplements as safer than were nonusers. Similarly, Ritchie, Gohmann, and McKinney (2005) found that patients diss atisfied with the quality of conventional care received were more likel y to use spiritual therapy. In contrast, many other studies fail to support this argument. For example, Donnelly, Spykerboer, and Thong (1985) did not find patients using CAM dissatisfied with orthodox medicine ; likewise, Astin (1998) found th at negative experiences with conventional medicine were not associated w ith alternative medicine use in the general population. Nor did Anderson et al. (2000) identify dissatis faction with conventional disease management as the major reason th at rheumatology and ge riatric patients use CAM. Similarly, based on national survey data, Eisenberg et al. (2001) found no Access Barriers and CAM Yu 6evidence in support of CAM usage primarily reflecting dissatisfaction with conventional care. Indeed, Shreffler-Grant, Weinert, Nic hols, and Ide (2005) re ported that 97% of CAM users with regular conventional medici ne providers in rural Montana and North Dakota rated their conven tional medicine care as good, very good, or excellent. Furthermore, Ritchie et al. (2005) found that satisfaction with the professional staff at the usual source of care was unrel ated to any use of CAM. These conflicting findings are possibly a result of imperf ect measures of dissatisfaction. Some scholars have argued that dissatisf action should be measured multidimensionally. For example, McGregor and Peay (1996) proposed three conceptually distinct categories of dissatis faction: (1) lack of confidence or general distrust in the effectiven ess of conventional medicine , (2) negative experience or provider-patient relationship, a nd (3) loss of hope that conv entional medicine can help. Based on their observation, although no significant difference in satisfaction with the last conventional visit existed be tween their alternat ive group and their community group, the former was significantly less satisfied with the effectiveness of conventional medicine than the latter. They conclude that satisfact ion with conventional medicine has different facets. Therefore, they suggest that dissati sfaction may be best manifested in a global evaluation rather than in relation to an individual's own sp ecific experience. Preference for CAM Preference for CAM is attributable to ma ny factors, including either traditional beliefs or confidence in home remedies a nd self-medication (Applewhite, 1995; Kelner & Access Barriers and CAM Yu 7Wellman, 1997; Roy, Torrez, & Dale, 2004), which may differ significantly among different racial and ethnic groups regardle ss of socioeconomic factors and health insurance status (Roy et al. 2004). Whereas Afri can Americans are most likely to believe some home remedies to be better than pres cribed drugs and most likely to treat their children with home remedies except in an emergency, Hispanics are less likely to do so (Roy et al. 2004). Applewhite (1995) reported that elderly Mexican Americans might use folk medicine because of their traditional beli efs. At the same time, alternative medicine patients show significantly more confidence in the competence of alternative medicine than patients of general practitioners (F urnham & Forey, 1994), and homeopathic patients tend to have more faith in the healing power of their ow n bodies through homeopathic therapy than do conventional medicine us ers (Furnham & Bhagrath, 1993). However, even though rural residents may show more confidence in home remedies (Bushy, 1990 as cited in W. J. Strickland & D. L. St rickland, 1995), among people who visited both conventional and alternative pr actitioners, perceived confid ence in CAM providers does not appear to differ substantially from that in conventional providers (Eisenberg et al., 2001). A second contributing factor to CAM pref erence is cultural or philosophic belief about the nature and meaning of health and illness. Those using CAM are more likely to have a holistic philos ophical belief in the whole person approach (Astin, 1998), meaning that they tend to believe that treatment s hould concentrate on the whole person not simply the symptoms (Furnham & Forey, 1994). Astin (1998) operationalized such a holistic philosophy of health as the he alth of body, mind, and spirit be ing related, meaning that Access Barriers and CAM Yu 8\"whoever cares for [one's] health should ta ke [such a relationship] into account\" (p. 1,549). For example, cancer patients using CA M likely believe that holistic healing emphasizes a mind-body connection that c onventional medicine does not address (Verhoef & White, 2002). The whole person approach also reflects lif estyle choices to which CAM usage is likely to be related based on the perceived va lue of disease preven tion and life promotion (Kessler et al., 2001). Thus, the patients of alte rnative practitioners ar e more likely than patients of family practitioners to exercise regularly, monitor diet, and take vitamin supplements (Kelner & Wellman, 1997). Sim ilarly, homeopathic users may be more likely to believe in a healthy lifestyle to pr event illness and in self-control over health (Furnham & Bhagrath, 1993). This belief in a healthy lifestyle to prev ent illness and in self-control over health constitutes the third contributory factor to CAM preference. For example, in the McGregor and Peay (1996) study, the al ternative medicine group members were significantly more likely to believe in self-c ontrol over health than the community group members. Similarly, Sirois and Gick (2002) found a tendency among CAM users to believe that CAM allows them more cont rol over their health, although they may not believe it makes them significantly resistant to illness in general (Furnham & Bhagrath, 1993). This population is also less likely to belie ve that it is a physician that can be of most help with health problems (Kelner & Wellman, 1997). In the research cited above, several patient groups reported using CAM as a control strategy. Despite recent advances in biomedicine, many diseases are still Access Barriers and CAM Yu 9incurable. Therefore, individuals are more lik ely to live longer with chronic diseases and reconcile with any approac h, outside or inside biomedicine, which makes them comfortable. For example, finding that CAM us ers with chronic illn ess (type 2 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and HIV/AIDS) believed in the potential benefits of CAM and took responsibility for their health, Thorne, Pate rson, Russell, and Schultz (2002) conclude that \"[CAM usage] may be more usefully unde rstood as one part of a complex process of self-care management\" (p. 681). These aut hors disagree with Be yerstein's (2001) argument that using CAM is irrational. Can cer patients may also favor CAM because of the need for control and activ e patient involvement in dis ease management (Montbriand, 1995; Verhoef & White, 2002). Consequences of Access Barriers Not only have perceived access barriers to conventional medicine been well documented (Ahmed, Lemkau, Nealeigh, & Mann, heer, Kroll, Neri, & Beatty, 2003), but vulnerable populations have been shown to face a greater likelihood of such barriers (Ahmed et al., 2001; Cook, Selig, Wedge, & Gohn-Baube, 1999; J. Strickland & D. L. Strickland, 1996). Research has specifica lly documented multiple consequences of perceived access barriers to health care, in cluding a reduced use of conventional medical care services that negatively impact quality of life, social life, economics, independence, and mental and physical health (Barnett, 2001; Katerndahl, 2002; Neri & Kroll, 2003; Scheer et al., 2003). In turn, these negative impacts lead to considerable unmet needs Access Barriers and CAM Yu 10such as deteriorating health and the devel opment of secondary health problems that subsequently increase the need for further intensive healthcare services (Barnett, 2001; Gaskin & Hoffman, 2000; Heisler et al., 2004; Neri & Kroll, 2003). Indeed, Gaskin and Hoffman (2000) showed that limiting access to primary care increases the likelihood of hospitalization for preventable conditions for African Americans and Hispanics. Likewise, Heisler et al. (2004) found that respondents with cardiovascular disease who reported access barriers to medications we re more likely to experience angina and nonfatal heart attacks or strokes. Problem Statement As suggested by the literature discussed above, the relationship between dissatisfaction with conventional medicine and CAM usage is controversial, particularly because most related studies have as ked overly general questions regarding dissatisfaction that do not reflect its poten tial multidimensionality (see McGregor & Peay, 1996). Although Penchansky and Thomas (1981) have argued that access barriers affect patient satisfaction, access barriers are only some of the dimensions of dissatisfaction, and are themselves multidimen sional. In addition, except for that of Ritchie et al. (2005) and Shmueli and Shuval (2006), no previous research to date on patient dissatisfaction has specifically a ddressed the issue of access barriers to conventional medicine. Even though both Ritchie et al. and Shmueli and Shuval examined the relationship between the availabi lity of conventional medicine and the use of CAM, their studies did not take into account that availability is only one of many Access Barriers and CAM Yu 11factors in the creation of access barriers. No study to date has examined the other important aspects of access barriers iden tified by Penchansky and Thomas, including acceptability, accommodation, acces sibility, and affordability. The purpose of this dissertation was to i nvestigate whether ther e is a relationship between perceived access barr iers to conventional medicine and the use of CAM. Although the literature suggests that perceived access barr iers to conventional medicine relate to dissatisfaction with conventional medicine and im pact the use of CAM, this relationship has not been t horoughly explored. To narrow th is research gap, this dissertation thoroughly investigated the relatio nship between perceived access barriers to conventional medicine and CAM usage rather than the indirect relationship between perceived access barriers to conven tional medicine and CAM usage through dissatisfaction with conventiona l medicine as a mediator. Both perceived access barriers to conven tional medicine and CAM modalities are considered multidimensional, with the latter being classified into distinct homogenous groups according to their nature and trea tment philosophy. CAM modalities are also classified in terms of whether they are practitioner-provided , such as chiropractic care, acupuncture, and massage, or self-directed , such as dietary or herbal supplements and vitamins (although these modalities may be obt ained through practitioners as well). The relationship between each perceive d access barrier a nd each CAM subgroup could vary. For instance, self-d irected CAM, such as the us e of herbs or vitamins, is much easier to access than pr actitioner-provided CAM. Most users can obtain their alternative medications in supermarkets, pharmacies, health food stores, or through Access Barriers and CAM Yu 12alternative medical suppliers (i.e., catalo gs and Web sites; Anderson et al., 2000). Therefore, it was hypothesized that those who perceive access barriers to conventional medicine, particularly barriers due to lack of access to comm unication or transportation or limited office hours, are more likely to use self-directed CAM. It is also hypothesized that certain perceived access barriers to conventional medicine, such as lack of transportation, might be barriers to practitioner-provided CAM as well. The primary research question addressed by this dissertation is whether perceived access barriers to conventional medicine ar e associated with the use of CAM. The research hypotheses were the following: 1. There is a positive relationship between perceived access barriers to conventional medicine and the us e of individual homogenous CAM subgroups. 2. There is a positive relationship between perceived access barriers to conventional medicine and the use of self-directed CAM. 3. There is a negative or no relationship between perceived access barriers to conventional medicine and the us e of practitioner-provided CAM. Significance of the Study Decisions regarding whether to seek me dical therapy for a particular health problem, and if so, which type of thera py to seek are often complex and difficult (Ganther, Access Barriers and CAM Yu 132005). Buor (2003) argued that access barriers to conventional medicine could impact the use of CAM. However, little attention ha s been paid to the relationship between perceived access barriers to conventional medici ne (e.g., lack of healthcare availability at night or on weekends or inability to cont act a physician) and CAM usage. Previous studies investigating this re lationship have either explored only one dimension of perceived access barriers or used a summary indicator of access barriers, which failed to distinguish among the different aspects of access barriers involved (Cleary, 1982; Pagan & Pauly, 2005; Ritchie et al. 2005; Shmue li & Shuval 2006). As opposed to previous research investigating one dimension or summary access barriers, this dissertation focuses on the use of CAM among individuals perceiving access barriers in terms of affordability, accessibility, and accommodation as proposed by Penchansky and Thomas (1981), separately. It is crucial that the re search gap regarding the re lationship between perceived access barriers to conventional medicine and CAM use be addressed. CAM has the great potential to improve the health of all people, but especially those f acing access barriers to conventional medicine. This dissertati on helps to narrow this knowledge gap by examining whether perceived a ccess barriers to conventional medicine (barriers to entry to the conventional medicinal system) are related to CAM u tilization through exploring both financial (affordability) and non-fin ancial (accommodation, and accessibility) factors that individually impact access (one ac cess barrier at a time) and interactively (more than one access barriers together). Access Barriers and CAM Yu 14To improve access to health care, di stinguishing between financial and non-financial access barriers is ne cessary because of their di fferent policy implications (Dutton, 1978). Not only must the financial bur den of care be redu ced through increasing health insurance coverage but also the health care delivery system mu st be reconstructed to minimize non-financial barriers of care. Po licies related to decr easing financial access barriers do not automatically lead to the e limination of non-financial barriers because these barriers are also influenced by the operation of the healthcare delivery system. Therefore, policies that aid in overcoming financial access barriers, such as offering Medicaid to low-income families, can improve access to healthcare in terms of affordability but may not be able to eliminat e other access barriers. As a result, it is important to examine both financial and non-fi nancial access barriers in order to provide recommendations for the creation of effective policies and interventions. Furthermore, this dissertation raises methodological concerns regarding modeling endogenous variables that have often been neglected in applied research. An exogenous variable in an equation is an explanatory variable uncorrela ted with the disturbance or error term of the equation whereas an endogenous variable is an e xplanatory variable correlated with the disturbance or the error term of the equation. Despite the fact that treating an endogenous regressor as an exoge nous regressor in simple probit models results in biased estimates (Monfardini & Radice, 2006), previous studies have treated access barriers to conventional medicine as e xogenous variables. In response to this concern, this study utilized biva riate probit models to evalua te the relationships between Access Barriers and CAM Yu 15individual access barriers and each hom ogenous CAM subgroup to ensure that access barriers be treated as endogenous rather than exogenous variables. In order to simultaneously evaluate the total impact of perceived access barriers related to affordabi lity, accessibility, and accommodation, this dissertation demonstrated the use of two advanced modeling technique s that addressed the modeling issues of endogeneity and sufficient conditions. All three perceived access barriers to conventional medicine were simultaneously treated as e ndogenous regressors in a multivariate probit model, which is an extension of a bivariate probit model. To evalua te one special case of causal complexity\u2014sufficient conditions, th is dissertation empl oyed a Boolean probit model to evaluate the effects of perceive d access barriers to c onventional medicine on CAM usage in terms of Bool ean processes that cannot be captured by linear additive models (Braumoeller, 2003, 2004). A sufficient condition here means that the summary perceived affordability access barrier or the summary perceived accommodation access barrier or the summary perceived accessibility acce ss barrier influences the use of CAM. Namely, the impact of perceived access barriers together is assumed to be cumulative but not additive. The Boolean probit model used here was developed to test complex causations by Braumoeller (2003, 2004) in politi cal science. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to apply th e Boolean probit model to health services research. To briefly illustrate, assuming CAM usage being attributed to either transportation problems or difficulty making an appointme nt to conventional medicine providers, consider an individual with a 50% chance of using CAM based on Access Barriers and CAM Yu 16transportation problems alone and a 50% ch ance of using CAM based on appointment difficulties alone. Rather than having a 100% (50% + 50%) chance of using CAM with both barriers, the individual will have 100% - (100% - 50%) \u00d7 ( 100% - 50%) = 75% chance of using CAM with both ba rriers, assuming that the proba bilities are independent. The remainder of the dissertation is orga nized as follows. Chapter 2 describes the theory and conceptual framework of this st udy before chapter 3 pres ents the literature review. Chapter 4 describes the methodology be fore chapter 5 displa ys the results of descriptive and statistical anal yses. Finally, chapter 6 summar izes and discusses the study findings. Access Barriers and CAM Yu 17CHAPTER 2: THEORY AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK This chapter presents a theory which connects perceived access barriers to conventional medicine and CAM usage. Then, th eoretical literature regarding Andersen's behavioral model of health se rvices utilization and access to health services is reviewed. Last, a conceptual framework linking percei ved access barriers to conventional medicine and CAM use conditioning on Andersen's behavior model of health se rvice utilization is provided. Theory of Conventional Medicine and CAM Usage The mechanism underlying the association between conventional medicine (CM) and CAM usage is derived from the theory of rational consumer choice. Rational consumers have well-defined preferences , shown by the convex shape of their indifference curves and their maximization of utility with due c onsideration of budget constraints. Figure 1 represen ts a person's preference for CM and CAM as represented by indifference curves (IDC 1-3). A rational person maximizing utility will choose to consume cm1 amount of CM and cam1 amount of CAM because point A is the highest utility affordable with respect to budget constraint B 1. INSERT FIGURE 1 HERE The presence of access barriers to medi cal services can be considered the imposition of extra costs upon the price of medical services. For example, a person Access Barriers and CAM Yu 18lacking transportation might need taxi service in order to get to a doctor's office. The taxi fee, which is necessary for the doctor's vis it to occur, becomes a portion of the total healthcare cost for this person. As this exampl e shows, the presence of access barriers to CM increases the total price of CM. A higher price for a medical service means that less of that service will be purc hased according to the law of demand for a normal good in economics. Corresponding with higher prices for CM due to access barriers, the budget constraint rotates inward to B 2. With this new budget constraint B 2, point A is no longer affordable. To maximize utility, this rationa l person will then choose point C, purchasing cm2 amount of CM and cam2 amount of CAM, resulting in more consumption of CAM and less of CM compar ed to point A. However, if access barriers are present to both CM and CAM, the total cost of both CM and CAM will increase and their consumption decrease. With access barriers accompanying the higher cost of CM and CAM, the budget constraint now shifts from B 1 to B 3. B1 and B 3 do not have to be parallel. Assuming utility maximization, this rational person will now choose point D, purchasi ng cm3 amount of CM and cam3 amount of CAM. Point D presents less consumption of both CM and CAM than does point A, which represents a utility maximiza tion point without a ccess barriers to both CM and CAM. From an economist's point of view, there is no market failure within this market for either of these two goods. However, societ y considers access barrie rs to health care unjust and undesirable. This dissertation investigates wh ether people facing perceived access barriers to conventional medicine are more likely to use CAM. Access Barriers and CAM Yu 19Review of Health Service Utilizat ion and Access to Health Services Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Service Utilization Andersen and Newman (1973) argued that individual characteristics influence whether or not a person seeks medical care, whereas physicians and others in the healthcare system decide what kind of\u2014and how much\u2014health services the individual needs. They proposed a framework for viewi ng healthcare utilizati on in which societal determinants affect health service systems and individuals. In this model, the main societal determinants are norms and technology \u2014the fundamental factors that affect how much a society wants to spend on health ca re. Two major dimensi ons of a healthcare system are resources (i.e., healthcare pe rsonnel, facilities, and equipment) and organization (i.e., the ways in which res ources are organized and distributed). Under influences of both societal determ inants and the health services system, individual determinants affect healthcare u tilization. Individual determinants include predisposing, enabling, and illness level. Am ong them, predisposing affects enabling and then influences illness level. Predisposing factors are demographics (age, sex, marital status, and past illness), so cial structure (education, race, occupation, family size, religion, and residential mobility), and beliefs (values concerning health and illness, attitudes toward health serv ices, and knowledge about diseas e). Enabling fact ors fall into two categories: family factors (income, heal th insurance, type of regular health care source, and access to regular care) and commun ity factors (ratios of health personnel and facilities to population, price of health services, region of country, urban-rural charter). Family factors include the resources a family can spend on health care, which relate to Access Barriers and CAM Yu 20affordability, while community factors have a great impact on access to health care because they relate to the loca l availability of health res ources. Both family-level and community-level enabling are considered hi ghly mutable and ther efore good candidates for potential interventions to improve access to health care. Illness-level factors include perceived needs (i.e., disability, symptoms, diagnoses, and general state) as well as evaluated needs (i.e., clinical ly judged symptoms and diagnoses). Perceived needs and evaluated needs are the major f actors in an individual's initia tion of a healthcare contact. Andersen and Newman (1973, p. 110) conclude , \"From a theoretical perspective the major determinants of health services utiliza tion have already been defined, such that the need for new explanatory variables is minimal.\" Two decades later, Andersen (1995) pr oposed an updated behavioral model of healthcare utilization. In this new model, individual determinants not only affect healthcare utilization, but also exert an impact on pe rsonal health practice. Both healthcare utilization and personal health practice are considered to be health behavior. However, Andersen (1995) did not describe the relationship between personal health practice and health care utilization. Andersen's healthcare utilization mode l is well accepted and has been used broadly in a variety of health and nonhealth contexts over the last three decades (Coulton & & Klein, Additionally, seve ral studies regarding CAM have employed Andersen's model (Kelner 21Sirois & Gick, 2002). Kelner and Wellman ( 1997) conclude that Andersen's model can be used to explain the use of CAM as we ll as the use of conventional medicine. Access to Health Services Noting that access had been poorly defined in the literature, Penchansky and Thomas (1981) defined the term as \"a concep t representing the degr ee of 'fit' between the clients and the system\" (p. 128). They propos ed to evaluate access in five reasonably discrete dimensions: availability, acce ssibility, accommodation, affordability, and acceptability. The authors outlined these five access dimensions, which can be distinctly measured and studied separately, as follows: Availability, the relationship of the volume and type of existing services (and resources) to clients' volume and types of needs.... Accessibility, the relationship betw een the location of supply and the location of clients, taking account of c lient transportation re sources and travel time, distance and cost. Accommodation, the relationship between the manner in which the supply resources are organized to accept clients (including appointment systems, hours of operation, walk-in facilities, telephone se rvices) and the clients' ability to accommodate to these factors and the client s' perception of their appropriateness. Affordability, the relationship of prices of services and providers' insurance or deposit requirements to th e clients' income, ability to pay, and existing health insurance.... Acceptability, the relationship of c lients' attitudes about personal and practice characteristics of providers to the actual characteristics of existing providers, as well as to provider attitudes about acceptable personal characteristics of clients.... (p. 128) Among the five dimensions, accessibility, accommodation, and affordability are associated with obstacles that can be cha nged by altering the current healthcare delivery system through actions such as offering eveni ng office hours. It is of critical importance Access Barriers and CAM Yu 22to distinguish access barriers from one another in order to develop effective interventions to improve or eliminate specific obstacles. Discriminant validity and c onstruct validity of the five dimensions of access were demonstrated. Penchansky and Thomas (1981) pe rformed a factor analysis and found that differentiation existed among the five dimens ions of access they proposed. Additionally, they performed a regression analysis to test co nstruct validity, which revealed that results generally supported the five access dimensions, especially accessibility, accommodation, and affordability. Factor scor es and summated ratings coul d be used to measure the dimension they represented. Penchansky and Thomas (1981) argue that access barriers are presumed to affect patients' satisfaction, utilizat ion of services, and provider practice patterns. Moreover, these outcomes are expected to correlate with each other. Conceptual Framework The conceptual model shown in Figure 2 summarizes the factors expected to influence a person's decision-making process with regard to CAM usage. According to Andersen's behavioral model, individual determinants, incl uding predisposing factors, enabling factors, and illness level (perceived needs and evaluated needs), influence a person's decision regarding whether to seek CAM. Based on the theory of access to health services proposed by Penchansky and Thomas (1981), there are five reasonably discrete but related dimensions of access barriers to conven tional medicine: availability, accessibility, accommodation, affordability, a nd acceptability. Determinants of each Access Barriers and CAM Yu 23dimension vary, and predisposing factors, enabling factors, and illness level might affect a person's perception of access barriers to conventional medicine as well. However, some individual determinants affecting both CAM and perceived access barriers to conventional medicine, such as health beliefs or risk attitudes, might not be observed. As identified in qualita tive studies using focu s groups, access barriers to conventional medicine may cause people to use CAM as a strategy to improve, or at least maintain, their health. However, there is li ttle, if any, published quantitative evidence available evaluating these relationships. This dissertation addresses this void in the existing knowledge. To do so, perceived acces s barriers to conventional medicine are grouped into affordability, accommodation, a nd accessibility factors to reflect their multidimensionality whereas CAM modalities ar e classified into distinct homogenous groups according to their natu re and treatment philosophy.

The first half describes definition of CAM, fo llowed by classification of CAM and prevalence of CAM in the United States. The second half reports empirical applic ation of Andersen's behavioral model of health se rvices utilization on CAM use, followed by access to health services. Last, previous studies regarding access barriers to conven tional medicine and the use of CAM are presented. Review of the Empirical Literature Definition of CAM By one definition, CAM is anything not prescribed by certified conventional medicine providers. In Kle mman's (1984) healthcare syst ems model, which defines alternative medicine from the prescribers' pe rspective, an \"'altern ative therapy' is any practice initiated or prescribed by patients themselves, their family or friends, or an alternative health care healer. 'Healers' are health practitione rs not associated with the American or Canadian Medical Associat ions\" (as cited in Montbriand, 1995, p. 646). NCCAM (2007) defines CAM \"a group of divers e medical and health care systems, practices, and products that ar e not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine\" This dissertation adopts th e definition of CA M from NCCAM. Classification of CAM Access Barriers and CAM Yu 27There are various classifications of CAM in the literature. Instances of CAM can be categorized according to treatment mechanism or philosophy. Alternative medical systems include homeopathic medicine, naturo pathic medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, and Ayurveda; mind-body interventions include meditation, prayer, mental healing, and therapeutic art, music, or dance; biologically based therapies involve herbs, foods, vitamins, and other natural products (e.g., shark cartilage); manipulative and body-based methods include chiropractic or osteop athic manipulation and massage; and energy therapies include Biofield therapies (e.g., qi gong, reiki, and therapeutic touch) and bioelectromagnetically based therapie s (e.g., pulsed fields, magnetic fields, and alternating-current or direct-current fiel ds; National Center fo r Complementary and Alternative Medicine [NCCAM], 2002). Forms of CAM can also be classified acco rding to whether they are provided by practitioners (e.g., chiropract ors, acupuncturists, and ma ssage therapists) or are self-directed (e.g., thro ugh the use of dietary supplements, herbal supplements, and vitamins; Shreffler-Grant et al., 2005). Howeve r, some approaches could be placed in both groups; for instance, herbs and vitamins ma y be prescribed by herbal practitioners or self-directed. Another method of classifying CAM focu ses on the purpose of use. Montalto, Bhargava, and Hong (2006) divided CAM into tw o categories: curative (e.g., chiropractic and acupuncture) and preventive/curative (e .g., massage, herbal products, breathing exercises, and meditation). The latter group could be used for prevention, treatment, or both, for example, drinking herbal tea in order to boost immunity. Access Barriers and CAM Yu 28 Prevalence of CAM in the United States Estimates of the prevalence of CAM in th e United States vary widely. Table 1 presents studies of CAM use in the United St ates using representative samples separated by CAM consultation and CAM usage in chrono logical order of publication. From lowest to highest, prevalence rates for CAM range from 5.3% in Ritchie et al . (2005) to 76% in Hendrickson et al. (2006). INSERT TABLE 1 HERE The variation in estimates of CAM preval ence may be attributed to a number of factors. One is the existence of different meas ures of CAM. As stated earlier, the scope of CAM is very broad. CAM, a summary term, c ontains a variety of modalities differing in nature as well as treatment philosophy. There is no consensus regarding what is included in CAM; as a result, there has been signifi cant diversity in the parameters of CAM in previous studies, as shown in Table 1. The number of types of CAM included has varied widely, ranging from 4 to 17 in various studies. As unique criteria or defi nitions of what counts as CAM have been employed in individual studies, researchers have been able to report different figures for prevalence of CAM usage even when using th e same data set. Citing the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), Druss and Rosenheck (1999) reported a prevalence rate of 8.2% for CAM consultations containing 12 types, while Bausell, Lee, and Berman Access Barriers and CAM Yu 29(2001) reported a prevalence rate of 9.0% fo r 11 types of CAM consultation. Relative to Bausell et al., Druss and Rosenheck incl uded one additional CAM type, which they termed \"others.\" Variation may also be caused by the way in which survey questions are worded. Some questions ask about consulting alternative medicine pract itioners in the last 12 months while others ask about the use of alternative medicine. Use of CAM and visits to CAM practitioners are two differe nt things. People who use a lternative medicine may or may not consult alternative medicine practit ioners. For example, herbal medicine and vitamins can be easily obtained in superm arkets and drugstores without a provider's prescription, facilitating simp le self-administration, wher eas chiropractic therapy is unlikely to be performed in th e absence of a consulting chirop ractor. Therefore, even if two modalities have similar prevalence rates for usage, they do not necessarily have similar prevalence rates for practitioner cons ultation. For instance, although both herbal medicine and chiropractic therapy have si milar rates of usage among the population (herbs at 12.1% vs. chiropractic at 11.0 %), Eisenberg et al. (1998) found that the estimated total number of visits to practitioners for herbal medicine was only 10 million while the estimated total number of visits to practitioners for chiropractic therapy was more than 114 million. As expected, researchers studying CAM cons ults have tended to find relatively low prevalence rates ranging from 5.3% to 19.5% (Bausell et al., 2001; al., 1998; Pa ramore, 1997; Ritchie et al., 2005), while studies about the use of CAM have reported hi gher prevalence rates ranging from 14.0% Access Barriers and CAM Yu 30to 76% (Astin, 1998; Astin et al., 2000; Tan, Pronk, & O'Connor, 2002; Hendrickson et al., 2006; Ni, Simile, & Ha rdy, 2002; Pagan & Pauly, 2005). However, it is possible th at the discrepancy between th e highest prevalence rate of 19.5% in a study of CAM consultations by Ei senberg et al. (1998) and the lowest prevalence rate of 14.0% in a study of CAM use by Hendrickson et al. (2006) is due to the different number of CAM types included in each study. Eisenberg et al. (1998) asked participants about consultati ons regarding 16 types of CAM, while Hendrickson et al. (2006) asked about the use of only 4 CA M types\u2014acupressure, folk medicine, homeopathy, and naturopathy. The difference between prevalence rates for usage and consultation appears in single modalities as well. Tables 2 and 3 summarize studies on the use of herbs and chiropractic therapy, respectiv ely, in the United States us ing representative samples separated by consultation or usage in chronol ogical order of publication. As seen when CAM was used as a summary measure, the prevalence rates for consultations in both modalities were lower than prevalence rates for usage. One noteworthy element is the degree of discrepancy between th e prevalence rate of usage and that of consultation. Some moda lities of CAM are more likely to have large discrepancies in this respect than others are. Modalities that are relatively easy to obtain and administer without a practitioner (e .g., herbal medicine) tend to show large discrepancies. A study conducted by Eisenberg et al. (1998) asked participants about consultations for and usage of CAM in a single survey. The discrepancy between the prevalence rates for herb usage and c onsultation was 2.2% in 1991 and increased Access Barriers and CAM Yu 31remarkably to 10.3% in 1997. While the increas e in the prevalence ra te of herb use was striking\u2014from 2.5% in 1991 to 12.1% in 1997\u2014ther e was only a slight increase in herb consultation during this peri od, from 0.3% in 1991 to 1.8% in 1997. This result showed that people dramatically increased self-directed herb usage from 1991 to 1997. For modalities such as chiropractic therapy that must be performed by practitioners, there are smaller discrepancie s between the prevalence rates for usage and consultation. In the study mentioned above , Eisenberg et al. (1998) found that the discrepancy between the prevalence rates for usage of and consulta tion for chiropractic therapy was 2.9% in 1991, decreasing to 1.1% in 1997. During this pe riod, both usage of and consultation for chiropractic therapy increased slightly. Distinguishing between usage of and c onsultation for CAM is of importance because each has distinct policy implicat ions. Prevalence rates for CAM consultation represent the demand for CAM practitioners a nd play a great role in public policies related to the supply of thes e practitioners. Moreover, prev alence rates for consultation have a considerable impact on insurance co mpanies. Popular enthusiasm for CAM use has driven more health insurance compan ies to cover CAM (P elletier & Astin, 2002). Eisenberg et al. (1998) estimated that up to $9 billion out of $21.2 billion in total expenditures for alternative medicine pract itioners in 1997 were paid by insurance companies. Consumers have been prompted to enroll in health insurance programs because they offer coverage for CAM and ha ve been willing to pay for additional CAM coverage, even in the case of current CAM nonusers (Astin et al., 2000). In this era, in which consumer-driven health plans have become more popular, insurance companies Access Barriers and CAM Yu 32must take public enthusiasm about CAM use into account when offering their products. It is reasonable to assume that this trend w ill continue. As insurance companies are more likely to reimburse clients for services pres cribed or provided by pr ofessionals, they are greatly influenced by prevalence rates for consultation. Prevalence rates for CAM use tell anot her story. Because CAM has potential interactions with conventi onal medical care (Niggemann & Gruber, 2003), patients' self-medication and failure to inform their healthcare prov iders about their use of CAM can cause serious problems. Eisenberg et al. (1998) re ported that around 18% of all prescription users concurrently used herbal medicine, high-dosage vitamins, or both. In various studies, however, it was found that patients' rates of disclosing CAM use to conventional medial care providers were lo w. Druss and Rosenheck (1999) found that less than 20% of users of bot h conventional and unconventiona l therapies had told their physicians about the CAM therapies they empl oyed. Astin et al. (2000) determined that over half of CAM users did not discuss their alternative therapies w ith their conventional providers. In another study, Planta, G undersen, and Petitt (2 000) reported that three-quarters of herbal medici ne users did not inform their conventional care providers of their herb intake. Conventional healthcare providers often do not properly document their patients' use of CAM, when their patients do tell them about it. It was found that physicians only documented about one-third of CAM use (Cockayne, Duguid, & Shenfield, 2005; Cohen, Ek, & Pan, 2002). As more and more people seek methods outside the mainstream healthcare system to cure diseases, promote or maintain health, prevent illness, or Access Barriers and CAM Yu 33all\u2014despite the fact that these methods may not have been proven effective by the mainstream medical system\u2014it is important for conventional medicine providers to understand not only the pattern and dosage of CAM usage, but also which groups of people use which types of CAM to what extent , in order to avoid either potential harm from the interaction of conve ntional medicine and CAM or insufficient consumption of effective conventional medicine. Another reason for variation in estimates of CAM prevalence is the peculiarities of data sources. Each data source has a unique sampling pool, scope, and strategy. As a result, the representative population can be different across data sources. Druss and Rosenheck (1999), for example, pointed out that estimates of prevalence rates from MEPS were lower than others because the sampling design of MEPS included non-English speakers and individuals without telephones. The authors argued that this MEPS sample could be more representative of the United States than sampling using telephone models of surv ey administration only. INSERT TABLE 2 HERE INSERT TABLE 3 HERE Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Se rvices Utilization and the Use of CAM This section is organized according to fact ors mentioned in Andersen's behavioral model of health services util ization - predisposing factors, enabling factors, and medical Access Barriers and CAM Yu 34needs. Andersen's healthcare utilization model has been used broadly in various health or non-health contexts (Coulton & & studies re garding CAM have employed Andersen's model Gi ck (2002) conclude that Andersen's model can be used to explain CAM usage. Predisposing and Enabling Factors Since almost every study examining predisposing factors also examines enabling factors, both factors are reviewed together to avoid redundancy. Astin (1998) did not find sex, race/ethnicity, income, or age signifi cantly predicting CAM use. However, other CAM studies have found signifi cant differences in the following determinants: gender (Bausell al., 2006; al., 2002), age (Astin et al., 2000; Busato et al., 2006; Eisenberg et 1993; Hendrickson 2006), education Rosenheck, 1999; Montalto et al., 2006), residence area (Hendrickson et al., 2006), health and lifes tyle habits (Hendrickson et al., 2006; Sirois & Gick, 2002), and health in surance (Hendrickson et al., 2006). Several researchers have reported that fe males are more likely to use CAM than males (Bausell et al., 2001; Druss & Rose nheck, 1999; Fennell, 2004; Ni et al., 2002). Access Barriers and CAM Yu 35Women were found to use significantly more both vitamins or minerals and herbal supplements than men (Fennell, 2004). It has also been concluded that more educated people are more likely to use CAM (Asti n, 1998; Druss & Rosenheck, 1999; showed that pe ople in the 40-49 age group were more likely to employ CAM, and Ni et al . (2002) reported this finding for middle-aged individuals in the 35-54 group. Druss and Rosenheck (1999) reported that Whites are more likely than other racial groups to use CAM. Ni et al. (2002) stated that Black non-Hi spanic and Hispanic people were less likely than White non-Hi spanic people to use herbal medicine, chiropractic therapy, and massage. Similarly, Bausell et al. (2001) found that Hispanics and African Americans visited significantly fewer CAM providers than did their White peers. In a study by Montalto et al. (2006), wh ite older adults were more likely to use CAM for curative purposes than were Blacks, Blacks were more likely to use CAM for preventive/curative purposes than were Whites. Furnham and Forey (1994) found that CAM users have more self- and ecologically aware lifestyles than non-CAM users do. Likewise , Sirois and Gick (2002) determined that health-aware behaviors we re associated with the use of CAM. Although Harris, Ripperger, and Horn (2000) stated that managed care with coverage of alternative medicine improve s access to the healthcare delivery system, health insurance did not offer equal covera ge of all modalities of CAM. Chiropractic therapy, for example, is more likely to be incl uded under coverage benefits than is herbal therapy. In 1990, 44% of chir opractic therapy users had at least partial chiropractic Access Barriers and CAM Yu 36therapy health insurance cove rage; this number increased to 56% in 1997 (Eisenberg et al., 1998). By contrast, 46% of herbal medicine users had at least partial herbal medicine health insurance coverage in 1990, whereas less than 20% of herbal medicine users had at least partial health insurance cove rage for herbal medicine in 1997. Given that nearly 90% of chiropracti c therapy is reimbursable by insurance including Medicare and Medi caid and that 40% of hea lth maintenance organization (HMO) cover chiropractic care (Herman, 1995 as cited in Paramore, 1997), health insurance affects the use of chiropractic se rvices. Different health insurance types, however, have different impacts on the use of chiropractic therapy. Paramore (1997) found that HMO enrollees used significantly less chiropractic thera py than did enrollees of preferred provider orga nizations (PPOs) and fe e-for-service plans. Therefore, a positive relationship between health insurance coverage and use of CAM might not be observed in ce rtain CAM modalities that are less likely to be covered by health insurance. As a result, pooling moda lities that are covered by health insurance together with those that ar e not to form a summary meas ure of CAM might dilute the effect of health insurance on covered modalities and then result in a failure to find significant relationships. For example, Ni et al. (2002) reported that health insurance status (insured vs. uninsured) did not have a significant influe nce on the use of CAM after adjusting for age, gender, and educational status. The effects of income on CAM use depe nds on study populations and the types of CAM studied. Using NHIS 2000, Fennell (2004) f ound that those with higher income and more education are more likely to use both vi tamins or minerals and herbal supplements. Access Barriers and CAM Yu 37Paramore (1997) found that persons who were less educated and had family incomes equal to or greater than 150% of the povert y level were more likely to use chiropractic therapy using the 1994 Robert Wood J ohnson Foundation National Access to Care Survey. Sirois and Gick (2002) discovered that Canadian CAM users tended to have middle to high income levels. However, Astin et al. (2000) stated that income was not associated with the use of CAM among el derly Californians w ith Medicare in a statistically significant manner. Unmet Needs According to Sirois and Gick (2002), the be st predictor of persistent CAM use is medical need, especially chronic pain and cardiovascular problems. Indeed, Paramore (1997) found that people visiting CAM pract itioners had significant unmet needs for medical care. Hendrickson et al. (2006) divided CAM into four distinct categories and found that while medical need was the only significant predictor across groups, medical need alone did not predict the use of CAM. Evaluated needs (medical conditions or problems) . CAM users are likely to report more health problems compared to CAM nonus ers (Sirois, 2002; Sirois & Gick, 2002). Paramore (1997) found that persons with one or more health conditions were significantly more likely to visit practitio ners of chiropractic therapy, relaxation techniques, or therapeutic massage than were people with no health conditions. Alternative medicine is used most often fo r chronic conditions including back problems, arthritis, memory loss, anxiety, depressi on, headaches, mental problems, metabolic Access Barriers and CAM Yu 38problems, chronic fatigue syndrome, and musc uloskeletal complaints et al., al., 2001; Eisenberg et al., 1998). Kelner and Wellman (1997) determined that in Canada, users of ch iropractic, acupuncture/ TEM, naturopathy, and reiki were more likely to have headache a nd musculoskeletal, emotional, gynecological, and digestive complaints. Siro is and Gick (2002) found that more established CAM users reported having headaches, back problems, and chronic pain than did new or infrequent CAM users. Astin et al. (2000), however, found that hypertension had a statistically significant negative association with the use of CAM. Despite findings such as those summari zed above, several studies have not found relationships between the total number of chronic conditions and the use of CAM (Fennell, 2004; Gray et al., 2002; McGregor & Peay, 1996). Fennell, for instance, discovered that the total number of health conditions is uncor related with the use of all herbs. Nor do McGregor and Peay (1996) fi nd significant differences in the number of chronic conditions or their duration betw een an alternative medicine group and a community group. Perceived needs (functional [physica l, emotional, mental] limitations, self-reported health status) . There are several measures of perceived needs, one of which is self-reported health. It is assumed that poorer health is positiv ely related to greater perceived need. Many studies have concluded th at poorer self-reported health predicts the use of CAM or visits to CAM provide rs (Astin, 1998; Bausell et al., 2001). Higginbotham et al. (1990) found that responde nts who consulted curanderos were more likely to report their health status as fair or poor than those who did not. Bausell et al. Access Barriers and CAM Yu 39determined that self-reported physical health status had a si gnificant negative relationship with CAM provider visits, whereas self-repo rted mental health status was not a significant predictor of visits. On the other hand, Paramore (1997) found that self-reported health was not significantly related to vis its to practitioners of ch iropractic therapy, relaxation techniques, or therapeutic massage. Additi onally, Astin et al. ( 2000) concluded that self-reported health status wa s not statistically significantly associated with the use of CAM among elderly persons. Fenne ll (2004) also reported that self-reported health was uncorrelated with herb use. One interesting finding by Kelner a nd Wellman (1997) was that although alternative medicine users were likely to repor t their health problems as more severe and of longer duration than were the patients of family practitioners, over 90% of them rated themselves as having good physical and emo tional health. In fact, they found that alternative therapy users had higher self-reported health th an did patients of family practitioners. The relationship between perceived needs and the use of CAM varies by gender. Ni et al. (2002) found that me n who self-reported th eir health as poor or fair were more likely to use CAM than those who repor ted good, very good, and excellent health. However, this difference was not observed among women. A second way to measure perceived needs involves the use of instruments such as the Short Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12). Astin et al. (2000) f ound that those with poorer physical health as measured with SF-12 were more likely to use CAM. Access Barriers and CAM Yu 40Another measure of perceived needs is f unctional limitations. It is assumed that people with more functional limitations are likely to report greater perceived need, thereby, using more CAM. Kelner and We llman (1997) found that nearly 90% of alternative medicine users repo rted that their probl ems affected their lives, compared to around two-thirds of patients of family pr actitioners. Similarly, Gray et al. (2002) concluded that CAM users were more likely to report physical or emotional limitations. Montalto et al. (2006) reported that the total number of limita tions in activities of daily living (ADLs) was positively related to the likelihood of using CAM for curative purposes. Fennell (2004) found that those with more functional limitations were more likely to use both vitamins or minerals and herbal supplements. Not Homogeneous Between Modalities of CAM CAM, as a summary measure, is not (Fennell, therefore, th e predictors of CAM usage vary with the types of moda lities included in research (F ennell, 2004). Montalto et al. (2006) found that there were differences between the predictors of curative CAM (chiropractic and acupuncture) and those of curative/preventive CAM (massage, herbal products, breathing exercises, and meditation) . Sirois found that experienced CAM users were more likely to seek treatment for non-life -threatening health issues, regardless of the number of health problems experienced, th an were new CAM users or nonusers. In addition, analysis of individual herbs found that women use more Dong Quai, Echinacea, and St. John's wort than men do, while there is no difference between the genders in the Access Barriers and CAM Yu 41use of Astragalus and Cat's Claw. Differences in usage were also noted for race/ethnicity, age group, education, health insurance status, lifestyle (smoking, drinking, and exercise), marital status, and weight. Hendrickson et al. (2006) reported different determinants of the use of different categories (as defined by NCCAM) of CAM. Montalto et al. (2006) conclude that when one st udies CAM use by grouping heterogeneous CAM approaches together, one hides the differences between the predictors of use of different CAM modalities. Dissatisfaction with Conventiona l Medicine and the Use of CAM Table 4 shows studies linking CAM use a nd dissatisfaction with conventional medicine in chronological orde r of publication. The results of this area of research have been controversial. Studie s supporting a connection betw een conventional medicine dissatisfaction and CAM use include Furnha m and Bhagrath (1993), Higginbotham et al. (1990), Jensen (1990), Montalto et al. (2006), Shahrokh et al. (2005), and Sirois and Gick (2002). Studies that failed to support this link include Astin (1998), Donnelly et al. (1985), Eisenberg et al. (2001), and Shreffl er-Grant et al. (2005). Using multiple measurements of dissatisfaction, Furnham a nd Forey (1994), McGregor and Peay (1996), Ritchie et al. (2005), and Shmueli and Shuval (2006) found evidence supporting a connection between dissatisfaction with conve ntional medicine and CAM usage in some respects but not others. Access Barriers and CAM Yu 42One factor contributing to this controversy could be the diverse CAM measures employed in these studies, as discussed in the previous section. Another contributing factor is imperfect measur ement of dissatisfaction. Among these studies, most asked an overa ll satisfaction ques tion such as the following: \"Thinking about the la st time you went to see a me dical doctor, how satisfied were you with the care you received? (4- point scale)\" (Asti n, 1998, p. 1549) or \"On a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 being completely di ssatisfied and 10 being completed satisfied, how would you rate your (or the patient's) satisfacti on with current disease management?\" (Anderson et al., 2000, p. 960) . The results regarding the relationship between overall satisfaction with conventi onal medicine and CA M use are equivocal. Three studies sought information about sa tisfaction with treatment effectiveness and the use of CAM (Jensen, 1990; McGre gor & Peay, 1996; Si rois & Gick, 2002). Dissatisfaction with conventional medicine tr eatment effectiveness was positively related to the use of CAM. Six studies explored the re lationship between satisfacti on with providers and the use of CAM (Astin, Ei senberg et and Forey (1994) and Sirois and Gi ck (2002) found that CAM users gave significantly lower scores to conventional medicine providers in the area of list ening. Eisenberg et al. (2001), however, did not find the same result. Ot her studies regarding time spent with, confidence in, and trust in conventional medici ne providers did not s upport the claim that dissatisfaction with providers in these aspects was related to the use of CAM except Access Barriers and CAM Yu 43perhaps the Shmueli and Shuval's study (2006), which found that lower satisfaction with attitude, length of visits, av ailability, and in general of specialists were significantly associated with CAM provider consultation. In summary, only dissatisfaction with conventional medicine treatment effectiveness is found to be positively related to the use of CAM; findings on the relationships between other aspects of dissati sfaction with conventional medicine and the use of CAM are equivocal. INSERT TABLE 4 HERE Access to Health Services In proposing to improve the measurement of access by considering (a) the availability of healthcare pr ofessionals and facili ties; (b) the way professionals organize the delivery of their services (e.g., office locations and office hour s); (c) the client's ability to pay medical bills; (d) the client's location; (e ) the client's and provider's acceptance of each other, Penchansky and Thomas (1981) failed to include other important factors specifically related to cl ients' circumstances. These other factors discussed below can negatively impact the uti lization of medical care even when none of the five access barriers identified by Penchansky and Thomas exists. Ahmed et al. (2001) discovered additiona l access barriers amo ng members of the nonelderly urban poor American population, such as difficulty obtaining childcare while seeking medical care and difficulty taking time off work. Women are less likely to access Access Barriers and CAM Yu 44health care because they needed to take care of housework and children (Buor, 2004; Strickland & Strickland, 1996). Clients might also lack a phone on which to make an appointment or inquire about services (S trickland & Strickland, 1996). Rural elderly residents stated lack of quality health care and social isolation as access barriers (Goins, Williams, Carter, Spencer, & Solovieva, 2005). In a study by Ahmed et al. (2001), 96% of nonelderly urban poor respondents reported at least one barrier, with almost three-quarters citing more than one. The researchers found different demographic factor s related to the various access barriers. Younger parents, for instance, were more likely to have difficulty finding childcare. Nonworking respondents were more likely to have transportation problems. They also found that people without telephones were mo re likely to report multiple barriers, including lack of information about free or di scounted health servic es, lack of childcare, and lack of transportation. It is acknowledge d that these access barriers to conventional medicine might prevent the use of practitioner-provided CAM as well. The five access dimensions proposed by Penchansky and Thomas (1981) are distinct but interrelated. Similarly, Scheer et al. (2003) concluded that access barriers often interact to produce a cumulative effect , making access more difficult. For instance, affordability and availability were correlat ed with accessibility. Pathman, Ricketts, and Konrad (2006) found that lower local physician density (i.e., low availability) was related to longer travel time, difficulties with travel (both of which are related to accessibility), and contacting physicians by phone (accommodation) among people who were uninsured or under Medicaid. Strickland and Strickla nd (1996) found that structural and Access Barriers and CAM Yu 45nonstructural barriers interacted to preven t rural minorities from using preventive health services. Many factors have been identified as influencing perceived access. Racial differences in perceived access barriers have been found to exist in the rural South, even after adjustments for socioeconomic status a nd the availability of local providers are made (Pathman, Fowler-Brown, & Corbie-Sm ith, 2006). In general, Blacks were more likely to perceive difficulties in getting me dical care when needed than Whites. Blacks also reported finding travel to care signi ficantly difficult and had a significantly high uninsured rate compared to Whites. Ho wever, there was no significant difference between Blacks and Whites in getting appoi ntments in 1 or 2 days, office waiting time, contacting providers by phone, or lo ng travel time to care. Ability to pay is the ma jor access barrier (Strickland & Strickland, 1996), and lack of health insurance is the most importa nt affordability barrier. Even when insurance covers 80% of needed services, low-income and elderly persons might have difficulties accessing needed care because of copayments or coinsurance (Fitzpatrick et al., 2004; Scheer et al., 2003). For example, Fitzpatrick et al. (2004) found that even with Medicare, elderly persons reported worrying about medical bills as the second most frequent access barrier. The most frequent barrier in this study was that doctors we re not responsive to patients' concerns. Other ba rriers mentioned among the el derly included transportation difficulty, fear for safety on stre ets, fear of discovery of serious illness, fear of unneeded tests, not having a regular docto r, taking care of others, and work responsibilities. These Access Barriers and CAM Yu 46perceived access barriers were found to be re lated to sociodemogra phic factors including low income, lack of supplemental insurance, older age, and female gender. Despite such findings, health insurance does not sufficiently ensure equal access. A study comparing different insurance types (Bair, Garcia, Romano, Siefkin, & Kravitz, 2001) found that asthma patients covered by th e state's Medicaid program were more likely to report perceived access barriers. Asth ma patients perceiving at least one access barrier were more likely to make at least one emergency-room visit. Access barriers are even more common am ong vulnerable populations. Scheer et al. (2003) found that in addition to gene ral access barriers such as transportation problems, people with disabilities face a wide range of other access barriers related to their disabilities. For this population, inaccessibility of provi der offices and examination and diagnosis equipment present obstacles to receiving needed health services. Inadequate health insurance benefits, which onl y offer certain times or kinds of therapies, increased affordability barriers for members of this population, who generally have more medical needs due to their disabilities. Furt hermore, lack of physician knowledge about disabilities and related medi cal requirements made accepta bility barriers worse. Income is commonly used to measure affo rdability. However, Atella et al. (2005) suggested that perceived affordability barri ers should be more multidimensional and representative of respondents' economic, financ ial, and social situations. They conclude that perceived affordability barriers are better predictors of using coping strategies than income is. Moreover, they found that predic tors of perceived affordability differ by countries. Income and education had a sta tistically significant positive relationship to Access Barriers and CAM Yu 47perceived affordability in Italy, whereas only income had a sta tistically significant positive relationship to perceived affo rdability in the United Kingdom. Access Barriers to Conventional Medicine and the Use of CAM People seeking to improve, or at least ma intain, their health adopt a variety of coping strategies when facing access barrier s to conventional hea lthcare services or prescription drugs (Atella et al., 2005; Barnett, 2001; Heis ler et al., 2005; Strickland & Hanson, 1996; Strickland & Strickland, 1995). On e definition of copying strategies is \"behaviour that involves a degree of c onscious planning in adverse circumstances\" (Barnett, 2001, p.142). Only a few st udies have paid attention to this topic, using samples from the United States, Europe, and New Zeala nd to explore what stra tegies and to what extent people cope with access barriers to health care. However, these studies have primarily focused on strategies for coping with cost barriers to conventional medicine (Atella et al., 2005; Barnett, 2001; Heis ler et al., 2005; Strickland & Hanson, 1996; Strickland & Strickland, 1995), rather than other access barriers such as accommodation or accessibility. Table 5 summari zes studies of strategies fo r coping with access barriers, in chronological order of publication. In qualitative studies, the following coping strategies were identified: substituting; rationing; postponing; no services or prescrip vital necessities; prioritizing care or medicatio ns; seeking financial assistance from primary care physicians, friends, or family; and changing or considering changing physicians (Barnett, 2001; Strickland & Hanson, 1996; Strickland & Strickland, 1995). Among these coping Access Barriers and CAM Yu 48strategies, the prevalence rate of substituting to chemist or natural medicine, home remedies, or other alternativ e therapies was found to be ar ound one fifth to one third (Barnett, 2001; Strickland & Strickland, 1995). Respondents in these qualitative studies ar e found to employ multiple strategies on a regular basis, choosing a pa rticular approach based on th eir circumstances at a given moment. For example, within the same hous ehold, parents might ration medical care, reasoning that they do not need medical attent ion while they seek medical attention for their children who have the same sympto ms (Strickland & Stri ckland, 1995). In New Zealand, Barnett (2001) found that individual and residential ar ea characteristics affected the coping strategies chosen. Respondents livi ng in less urban and deprived areas were more likely to get financial assistance from their general practitioners compared to their counterparts living in more urban areas. More over, respondents who reported sometimes avoiding physician care because of costs were more likely to use the \"substituting\" coping strategy than were respondents who ne ver failed to seek phys ician care because of cost. Two quantitative studies regard ing coping strategies relate d to the affordability of prescription drugs were conducted in the Unite d States (Heisler et al., 2005) and Europe (Atella et al., 2005). Studying patients in Italy and the Un ited Kingdom, Atella et al. (2005) also confirmed that patients faci ng affordability barriers employed multiple coping strategies and used these strategies mo re frequently than did those without cost barriers. Patients' ability to afford care had a statistically significant negative relationship to the number of patient-initia ted coping strategies (avoiding GP visits or not getting Access Barriers and CAM Yu 49drugs, prioritizing, financing, rationing, or pos tponing) and the number of self-medication coping strategies (substitu ting to other products). Factors other than affordability affect the coping strategies patien ts select as well. Heisler et al. (2005) studied a dults with chronic diseases in the United States and found that almost one third reported employing at least one coping strategy to deal with high prescription medication costs over the past 12 months. Among them, people who had low incomes, were in poor health, and were taking multiple medications were often employing copying strategies such as cutting necessities, in creasing debts, or underusing medications. The use of CAM was identified as a s ubstitution coping strategy in coping strategy studies. Strickland and Strickland (1996) found that U.S. rural residents' confidence in home remedies might make th em more likely to depend on home remedies and self-treatment when they encountere d inability to pay. Fennell (2004) found that people without health insurance were more lik ely to use herbs. Montalto et al. (2006) determined that Blacks were more likely to use CAM that included self-directed modalities for preventive/curative purposes than were Whites, not only due to cultural differences between the races but also becau se of access issues. Pagan and Pauly (2005) found that people who had unmet medical needs a ssociated with cost were more likely to use CAM. They argued that people substitute CAM for conventional medicine because the latter is unaffordable. Ritchie et al. (2005) found th at people with perceived barriers to obtaining care needed for a special problem were more like ly to use any CAM in a whole, herbs, and Access Barriers and CAM Yu 50spiritual therapy. However, they failed to distinguish access barrier s from one another, employing a summary indicator. Their indicator c ould be divided into availability (i.e., did not know where to get care), accessibil ity (i.e., transportation problems and physical problems), accommodation (i.e., communication problems), affordability (i.e., financial or insurance problems), and othe r (i.e., could not get child ca re, was refused services, was unable to get time off work, and did not have time to get care). The first four access barriers were proposed by Penchansky and Thom as (1981) as parts of five distinct access dimensions that might not be easily separate d, while the last has been mentioned in many other studies (Ahmed et al., 2001; Buor, 2004; Cook et al., 1999; Omar, Schiffman, & Bauer, 1998). The other drawback of Ritchie et al. ( 2005) study is that they treated the access barriers as exogenous regressors. As mentione d in the previous section, it has been well documented that perceived access is determined by many factors such as race/ethnicity and ability to pay. Perceived access barriers mi ght be due to self-sel ection and related to the use of CAM. When one treats access barr iers as exogenous regressors, one fails to capture this self-selection effect, which will result in biased estimated (Monfardini & Radice, 2006). INSERT TABLE 5 HERE In summary, empirical evidence is provided regarding definition and classification of CAM, various prevalence rate of CAM in the US and contributing Access Barriers and CAM Yu 51factors, determinants of CAM usage, dete rminants of access barriers to conventional medicine, and few previous studies related to perceived access ba rriers to conventional medicine and CAM usage.

This chapter describes the study's data source, sample popul ation, dependent variables, variables of interest, and analysis plans. Subjects and Sample Selection The target population for this analysis is noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian residents age 18 to 64. The data source is the 1999 and 2002 Nationa l Health Interview Survey (NHIS) (National Center for Hea lth Statistics [NCHS], 2002a, 2003a), a survey conducted annually by the Centers for Diseas e Control and Prevention's NCHS since 1957 (Schiller & Bernadel, 2004). The target universe for the NHIS is defined as the noninstitutionalized civilian population in hous ehold units in the United States (NCHS, 2006). The NHIS is conducted continuously throughout the year through face-to-face interviews. The 1999 and 2002 NHIS are conduct ed using Computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI), which has be en employed since 1996, in households. The NHIS utilizes a multis tage-area probability sampling frame with independent address lists obtained explicitly for its purpos es. The survey uses methods of clustering and stratification. While the NHIS contains a national representative sample of the 50 states, the sample size is too small for precise state-level an alysis. The sample designs of the NHIS change roughly every 10 years. T he black and Hispanic populations have been oversampled to ensure that adequate samples are obtained since 1995 (Adams, Hendershot, & Marano, 1999). The 1997 to 2005 NHIS share the same sample design. Access Barriers and CAM Yu 76Survey participation is voluntary, but the a nnual response rate is ge nerally greater than 90% among eligible households. The data collected through the NHIS diffe r from year to year. Since 1997, the instrument has contained a Basic Module (inc luding a Family Core, Sample Adult Core, and Sample Child Core) and several supplemen ts that vary in content across years. The NHIS inquired about the use of CAM in 1999 and 2002. One of the 2002 NHIS supplements is the Alte rnative Health /Complementary and A lternative Medicine File. Although no such supplement was in cluded with the 1999 survey, the 1999 NHIS Sample Adult Core file contains several que stions regarding the us e of CAM. Both the 1999 and 2002 NHIS Sample Adult Core files cont ain several questions with respect to access barriers. Questions in Sample Adult Core files ar e designed to gather more specific and detailed information (NCHS, 2002b, 2003b). An adult age 18 and more is randomly selected in each family in NHIS as a sample adult to answer the Sample Adult Core file. Moreover, sample adults have to response for himself or herself with a few exceptions of proxy respondents allowed in 2002. The final response rates of eligible sample adults are 70% in 1999 and 74% in 2002 taking into acc ount household and family non-response. All sample adults in 2002 were asked to answer the Alte rnative Health/Complementary and Alternative Medicine Supplement, but 1% ( unweighted) of them did not complete the supplement. To correct for the complex sampling methodology in NHIS, the final annual Sample Adult weight adjusted for design, ratio, non-response, and post-stratification for Access Barriers and CAM Yu 77sample adults is used in this dissertation. Since th e focus of this dissertation is not estimates of totals, the final annual Sample Adult weights are not further adjusted in pooled data. Measures Measure of CAM The NHIS 2002 Alternative Health/Compl ementary and Alternative Medicine (ALT) File contains questions regarding respondents' use of 17 alternative healthcare practices at any time and in the past 12 months. The modalities covered in the supplement are acupuncture, Ayurveda, biofeedback, chelation th erapy, chiropractic care, energy-healing therapy/reiki, folk medici ne, hypnosis, massage, naturopathy, natural herbs, homeopathic treatment, special diet s, high-dose or megavitamin therapy, yoga/tai chi/qigong, relaxation techniques, and prayer and spiritual he aling. Results regarding use of CAM in the past 12 months are employed in the pr esent analysis. The NHIS 1999 Sample Adult Core contai ns questions regarding use during the past 12 months of alterna tive healthcare services in cluding acupuncture, relaxation techniques, massage therapy, imagery, spiritua l healing/prayer, lifes tyle diets, herbal medicine, homeopathic healing, hypnosis, and others (e.g., accupressure, anthroposophical medicine, aromatherapy, chelation therapy, Chinese medicine, chiropractic therapy, homeopathy, meditation, music therapy, naturopathy, tai chi, vitamins and minerals, and yoga). Access Barriers and CAM Yu 78A dummy variable indicati ng a summary measure of any type of CAM usage was created to describe the situation whereby a respondent answered yes to any question regarding the use of any CAM approach. As CAM approaches are not homogeneous, CAM types are categorized in to alternative medical sy stems, mind-body interventions, biologically based therapies, manipula tive and body-based methods, and energy therapies, following the cat egories and classificati ons of NCCAM (2002) and Hendrickson et al. (2006) as shown in Tabl e 6. A dummy variable indicating a summary measure of a CAM category was generated if use of any approach in the category was answered yes. INSERT TABLE 6 HERE Practitioner-provided CAM vs. Self-directed CAM Compared to practitioner-provided CAM, self-directed CAM treatments such as herbs and vitamins are much easier to obt ain. Most users obtain their alternative medications in supermarkets, pharmacies, he alth food stores, or through alternative magazines (Anderson et al., 2005). Therefore, it is hypothesized that people who perceive barriers to accessing conventional medicine ar e likely to use self -directed CAM. In contrast, perceived access barrie rs to conventional medicine su ch as lack of telephone or transportation problems could apply to pr actitioner-provided CAM as well. It is hypothesized that there is no si gnificant connection between pe rceived access barriers to conventional medicine and the us e of practitioner-provided CAM. Access Barriers and CAM Yu 79In the 2002 NHIS ALT file, questions re garding CAM use can be grouped into two groups\u2014one group of CAM is assumed to be only provided by practitioners and the other could be obtained through either self-directed or prac titioner-provided. 10 types of CAM\u2014acupuncture, Ayurveda, biofeedback, chiropractic energy healing/reiki, folk medicine, hypnosis, ma ssage, and naturopathy\u2014belonged to the former group and were asked by similar questions as: \"DURING THE PAST 12 MONTHS [capitalized in the original], did you see a practitioner [italics added] for ________?\" Therefore, all of these CAM forms are classified as practitioner-provided CAM. In contrast, natural herbs, homeopathic treatment, special diets, high-dose or megavitamin therapy, and relaxation techniqu es belonged to the latter group and were asked by similar questions as: \"DURING TH E PAST 12 MONTHS [capitalized in the original], did you use ________ for your own hea lth or treatment?\" A following question regarding practitioners was asked for persons who answered yes to the previous question as: \"DURING THE PAST 12 MONTHS [capita lized in the original], did you see a practitioner for ________?\" Only a small portion or small count of users in the past 12 months of natural he rbs (5.3%), homeopathic treatmen t (21.0%), special diets (8.4%), therapy (11.8 %), and relaxation techniques (3.3%) saw practitioners, and no users of yoga/tai chi/qigong and prayer and spiritual healing were asked this kind of questions about practitione rs. Therefore, natura l herbs, homeopathic treatment, special diets, high-dose or me gavitamin therapy, relaxation techniques, Access Barriers and CAM Yu 80yoga/tai chi/qigong, and prayer and spiritual hea ling are grouped into self-directed CAM. This classification will be applied to th e 1999 NHIS data as well (see Table 7). A dummy summary variable indicating the presence of practitioner-provided CAM was created if use of any modality in th is category was answered yes. Likewise, a dummy summary variable was generated for the presence of self-directed CAM. This dissertation analyzed eight outcomes: a summary measure of any type of CAM usage, five distinct categories, or ganized as shown in Table 6, as well as practitioner-provided and se lf-directed CAM, organized as shown in Table 7. INSERT TABLE 7 HERE Measure of Perceived Access Barr iers to Conventional Medicine The same set of questions with respect to perceived access barriers is contained in the 1999 and 2002 NHIS Sample Adult Core. In the 2002 Sample Adult file, acces s barriers are addressed in Part A\u2014Access to Care of Section V\u2014Health Care Access and Utilization . The measurement of access barriers begins with a qu estion regarding delay in getting medical care: There are many reasons people delay ge tting medical care. Have you delayed getting care for any of the followi ng reasons in the PAST 12 MONTHS [capitalized in the original]? (1) Yes (2) No (7) Refused (9) Don't know AHCDLYR1< ...You couldn't get through on the telephone.> AHCDLYR2< ...You couldn't get an appointment soon enough.> AHCDLYR3< ...Once you get there, you have to wait too long to see the doctor.> AHCDLYR4< ...The (clinic/doctor's offi ce) wasn't open when you could get t h e r e . > Access Barriers and CAM Yu 81AHCDLYR5< ...You didn't have transportation. > The following question addressed affordability: During the PAST 12 MONTHS [capitalized in the original], was there any time when you needed any of the following but didn't get it because you couldn't afford it? (1) Yes (2) No (7) Refused (9) Don't know AHCAFYR1< ...Prescription medicines > AHCAFYR2< ...Mental health care or counseling > AHCAFYR3< ...Dental care (including check-ups) > AHCAFYR4< ...Eyeglasses > The impact of individual access barrier items on the use of CAM was examined. A dummy variable indicating a summary meas ure of any perceived access barriers to conventional medicine was created to desc ribe the situation whereby a respondent answered yes to any question rega rding access barriers noted above. Moreover, perceived access barriers to conventional medicine are grouped into distinct dimensions proposed by Penchansky and Thomas (1981), as shown in Table 8. Four questions in terms of accommodation in clude the following problems: couldn't get through on the telephone, couldn't get an appoi ntment soon enough, have to wait too long to see the doctor, and lack of office hour avai lability at needed times. One question about transportation is assigned to the accessibi lity dimension. The remaining four access barriers are grouped into the affordability dimension. A dummy variable indicating a summary measure of the presence of perceived accommodation barriers was crea ted if any one of the ques tions in this category was answered yes. Likewise, a dummy summary vari able was constructed for the presence of perceived affordability barriers. A dummy vari able indicating the pr esence of perceived Access Barriers and CAM Yu 82accessibility barriers was created if lack of tr ansportation was answered yes. These three summary indicators are referred to as the summary perceived accommodation access barrier, the summary perceived affordability access barrier, and th e summary perceived accessibility access barrier hereinafter and were examined with CAM usage, respectively. This dissertation contains 13 variables of interest: the summary measure of any perceived access barriers, three individual pe rceived access barrier dimensions, and nine individual perceived access barrier items. INSERT TABLE 8 HERE However, there were no questions addr essing two other dimensions proposed by Penchansky and Thomas (1981)\u2014the availabi lity and acceptability dimensions of access\u2014in the 1999 and 2002 NHIS. As a result, th is dissertation does not evaluate these dimensions of access. Data Analysis Missing Data and Covariate Coding There are missing data for most variables in the NHIS. All answers of refused (7 or 97), not ascertained (8 or 98), and don't know (9 or 99) in ques tions are considered missing data. Cases with missing data were dr opped analysis by analysis; that is, cases were excluded only for variables for which they have missing data in the model of interest. Access Barriers and CAM Yu 83To preserve data, missing data on edu cation were imputed using the hotdeck procedure in Stata/SE, version 9.2 (Stata Corp, 2005a, 2005b). Assuming data are missing at complete random or at random, Hotdeck re places the missing value of a case with the corresponding value from a case with comple te data matched by specified variables. Education status was hotdecked by matching sex, age, marital status, race, ethnicity, employment status, educational status, and presence of a child in the family. Missing data regarding marital, employment, or whether in school had been previously hotdecked using similar variables. Income data as measured as the federal poverty level (FPL) were merged with an income imputation file provided by the NCHS (2002a, 2003a). The missing data in a usual source of care variable was recoded to no to reserve data, resulting in 20 cases in the final Boolean model. Covariates are divided into groups\u2014sex (female, Other/MR); ethnicity (non-Hispanic, Hispanic); education (no high school degree, high school degree, some college, college degree, post-undergraduate); poverty le vel (<100% FPL, 100-124% FPL, 125-199% FPL, 200-399% FPL, 400+ FPL); health status (ex cellent, very good, good, fair, poor); health insurance status (uninsured, in sured); citizenship (no, yes); regions (northeast, Midwest, south, west); presence of children in a fam ily (no, yes); usual source of care (no, yes); smoke status (no, yes); dri nk status independent, IADL dependent); Language ( English, Spanish, Others). Access Barriers and CAM Yu 84Software Analyses for this dissertation were conducted using Stata/SE, version 9.2 (StataCorp, 2005a, 2005b). Stata has comme nds designed to handle the special requirements of complex survey data such as probability sampling we ights, cluster, and stratification. Variance estimat es can be produced using balanced repeated replication, the jackknife, or Taylor linearization and ad justed according to the design of a complex survey. In this dissertation, variance estimates were produced using Taylor linearization unless otherwise noted. Analysis Plan Individual perceived access barrier and i ndividual summary perceived access barrier dimensions Analyses were conducted for 13 variables of interest: the summary measure of any perceived access barriers, three individua l perceived access barrier dimensions, and nine individual perceived access barrier item s. The analyses were conducted using the eight CAM outcomes (hereafter referred to as the use of CAM unless otherwise noted), the summary measure of any type of CAM usage, the five distinct categories, and the use of practitioner-provided and self-directed CAM using both simple probit and bivariate probit models. Any model in this section only modeled one perceived access barrier and one CAM outcome at a time, resulting in 104 pairs of analyses. Each analysis was conducted in both simple probit and bivariate probit models using the same sample in order to control for the sample selection probl em in model comparison; that is, results of Access Barriers and CAM Yu 85different models using different samples are not comparable because the different results come from both different samples and models. Simple probit model. The analysis plan outlined in this section is adapted from Jones (2007). One of the simplest approaches to testing the effect of a perceived access barrier on the use of CAM involve s a simple probit model. As identified in the previous chapter, access barriers are a ffected by various factors; that is, access barriers may not be randomly distributed among these factors. Fo r example, those perceiving access barriers might be more likely to be female or older than those who do not. In addition, confounding factors may themselves affect the use of CAM. If all observable characteristics affecting both a perceive d access barrier and the use of CAM are measured and included in the simple probit mode l, bias from self-selection is said to be ignorable, given all observable characteristics. As a resu lt, a simple probit model to examine the impact of a perceived access barrier on the use of CAM produces valid results, as long as all influe ncing observable characteristics ar e measured and included in the model. Equation 1 represents th e non-linear function of CAM usage ( CAM ) conditioning on a perceived access barrier a nd a set of individua l characteristics ( X). () ( )i X i PAB i i i X PAB X PAB CAM' ' 0 , ,1 Pr + += = (1.) Where: i CAM = 1: The presence of use of CAM for subject i iPAB = 1: The presence of a perceived access barrier for subject i Access Barriers and CAM Yu 86iX: The vector of explanat ory variables for subject i : Parameter : Parameter vector ().: The standard normal distribution function However, if there are unobservable ch aracteristics or unmeasured observable characteristics (e.g., attitudes toward health services or knowledge about disease) that have an impact on an perceived access barrier and are also associated with the use of CAM, the coefficient of the perceived acce ss barrier estimated using a simple probit model may bias the inferen ce of access barriers on th e use of CAM (Jones, 2007; Monfardini & Radice, 2006). To deal with this problem of selection on unobservable characteristics, a recursive bivariate probit model, which explicitly models selection on unobservable factors, can be used to test th e impact of a perceive d access barrier on the use of CAM by constructing the perceived ac cess barrier as an endogenous regressor in the equation for the use of CAM. Bivariate probit model. A recursive bivariate model contains two equations in terms of two latent variables, *PAB and *CAM , respectively. Both latent variables are assumed to have a linear function of a set of observable characteristics with an error term. The error terms in both equations are assumed to have a bivariate no rmal distribution and are allowed to be correlated because of unobs erved characteristics affecting both latent variables. Moreover, both equations may or may not contain the same set of explanatory Access Barriers and CAM Yu 87variables; that is, the vect or of explanatory variables Z do not have to be the same as the vector of explanatory variables X. iAB i Z i Z PAB ++=' 0* (2.) i CAM i X i PAB X PAB CAM Where: * iPAB : The unobserved latent variable of a perceived access barrier for subject i * i CAM : The unobserved latent variable of CAM usage for subject i iPAB : An observed perceived access barrier for subject i iZ: The vector of explanatory variables affecting a perceived access barrier for subject i iX: The vector of explanatory variab les affecting CAM usage for subject i : Parameter : Parameter vector : Parameter : Parameter vector Access Barriers and CAM Yu 88i: Error for subject i For every subject i, a perceived access barrier (P AB) is observed according to the rule: == 01 ii PABPAB ifif 00 ** > ii PABPAB (4.)

There are two approaches to estimate a bivariate recursive probit model: one is to put the propensity score of a perceived access barrier obtained from Equation 5 into Equation 6 and then to estimate Equation 6; the other is to put the ac tual observed value of a perceived access barrier in Equation 6 and then to estimate both Equation 5 and 6 simultaneously by full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation (Jones, 2007), allowing their error terms to correlate. This dissertation conc erns the impact of actual perceived access barriers on the use of CAM rather than the impact of the propensity to perceive access barriers. Following Jones' (2007) suggestions (p. 41) , the actual value of a perceived access barrier is considered in Equation 6 to estim ate the impact of a perceived access barrier on Access Barriers and CAM Yu 90the use of CAM. Both bivariate probit and si mple probit models were used for each pair of analysis using the same sample. Sampli ng weights were taken into account using pweight option for sampling weights in Stata. Since bivariate probit does not work with svy prefix in Stata version 9. 2, strata and psu were concat enated and then used with cluster option in both models to take clustering into account. Covariates in the equati on of CAM use include sex, age, race, ethnicity, education, family poverty level, self-repor ted health status, sm oking, drinking, ADL, IADL, health insurance, US citizenship, language, region, an d year. Covariates in the equations of perceived access barriers are shown in Table 8. Th ese covariates were chosen, as they were identified as determinants in literature, as described in Chapter 2. The instrument variables in the percei ved access barrier equations include the presence of children in a family (Buor, 2004; Strickland & Strickland, 1996) and a regular source of healthcare (Kasper, 2000). These variables were tested for exclusion restriction by verifying that they predicte d each perceived access barrier using simple probit models. The presence of children in a family is statistically significant in all perceived access barrier equations at th e 0.001 level whereas a regular source of healthcare is only statistically significant in some perceived acce ss barriers equations. The average treatment effect (ATE) of an individual perceived access barrier on the use of CAM is calculated using syntax sim ilar to Jones' (2007) Stata syntax (p. 48). The treatments effect (TE) of a perceived access barrier on the use of CAM for a person is the difference between the probability of using CAM when this person perceives access barriers and the probability of using CAM when the same person does not Access Barriers and CAM Yu 91perceive access barriers, both computed us ing his/her special values of observable characteristics. The ATE averages the treatm ents effects computed for each and every observation for the entire population. Samp ling weights are taken into account, and standard errors of ATEs are calculated using the delta met hod (Greene, 2003).

Three models, a simple probit model, a multivariate probit model, and a Boolean probi t model, were employed to investigate the effects of perceived access barriers under different modeling assumptions. The same sample was used in all three models in order to control sample selection problems in model comparison. Sampling weights were ta ken into account using pweight option for sampling weight in Stata. Strata and psu were concatenated and then used with cluster option in all three models to take cluste ring into account. Covari ates in a CAM use equation included sex, age, race, ethnicity, e ducation, family poverty level, self-reported health status, insurance, US citizenship, re gion, and year. Variable used in previous bivariate probit analyses incl uding smoking, drinking, ADL, IADL, and language used in interview were not included here due to difficulty in estimation. Access Barriers and CAM Yu 93Simple Probit Model. In a simple probit model, three perceived access barrier dimensions\u2014the summary perceived affordab ility access barrier, the summary perceived accommodation access barrier, and the summ ary perceived accessibility access barrier\u2014are assumed to be exogenous indepe ndent variables with additive effects on CAM usage. The effect of an independent va riable can be offset by other independent variables in a simple probit equation. That is , if the coefficient of the summary perceived affordability access barrier is negative whereas that of the summary perceived accommodation access barrier is positive and of the same magnitude, a person with both perceived affordability and accommodation acce ss barriers will have the same probability of using CAM as would a person without bot h perceived access barriers but with the same other characteristics. This situation ar ises because the opposite direction of effects of perceived affordability and accommodation access barriers offset each other. The simple probit model was created by performing the following calculation: i CAM i X i ACB i AMB i AFB i XB ACB AMB ++ + + +=' 0* (9.) where iAFB : Summary perceived affordability access barrier for subject i i AMB : Summary perceived accommodation access barrier for subject i iACB : Summary perceived accessibility access barrier for subject i * i CAM : The unobserved latent variable of CAM usage for subject i iX: The vector of explanatory variab les affecting CAM usage for subject i Access Barriers and CAM Yu 94: Parameter : Parameter vector i: Error for subject i Multivariate Probit Model. A recursive multivariate probit model, an extension of a bivariate probit model, also assumes th e effects of each perc eived access barrier dimension to be additive on CAM usage. Ho wever, this model considers these three dimensions of perceived access barriers to be endogenous. To capture endogeneity, each and every perceived access barrier dimension is modeled as a separate equation in addition to the equation for CAM usage, formin g a joint model of four equations in terms of four latent variables\u2014the summary per ceived affordability acce ss barrier (AFB), the summary perceived accommodation access barrier (AMB), the summary perceived accessibility access barrier (ACB), and CAM usag e (CAM)\u2014as can be seen in Equation 10 to 13. These four latent va riables are assumed to have a linear function of a set of observable characteristics with an error term , separately. The error terms in these four equations are assumed to have a four-dimensi onal normal distributi on and are allowed to be correlated because of unobserved characte ristics affecting the four variables. No restriction is placed on the corr elation structure of the error terms of these four equations. Matrix 14 represents the variance-correlati on structure of the e rror terms from Equation 10 to 13. Moreover, the four equations ma y or may not contain the same set of explanatory variables.

Access Barriers and CAM Yu 97 The same rule is also applied to the summary perceived accommodation access barrier, the summary perceived accessibility acce ss barrier, and use of any type of CAM. Covariates in the summary perceived affordability access barrier equation include attitude (worry about cost of conventional medicine), sex, ag e, race, ethnicity, education, family poverty level, private health insura nce, public health insurance, and year. Covariates in the summary perceived acco mmodation access barrier equation include a regular source of healthcare, sex, age, race, ethnicity, private health insurance, public health insurance, and year. Covariates in the summary perceived accessibility access barrier equation include the presence of childre n in a family, sex, age, race, ethnicity, education, and year. Compared with Table 8, which lists covariates used in bivariate probit models, working phone in household is not included in both of the summary perceived affordability and accommodation acce ss barrier equations due to concerns of estimation difficulties caused by the small variation of this variable. Instrument variables used in this multivariate probit model are different from those included in bivariate probit models. The instrument variable in the summary perceived affordability access barrier equa tion is attitude (wo rry about cost of conventional medicine) whereas it is the presen ce of a regular source of healthcare for the summary perceived accommodation access barrier equation and the presence of children in a family for the summary perceived accessibility access barrier equation. These variables were found to correlate with access barr iers in literature and tested for exclusion restriction by verifying that they predicte d the perceived access barrier for which they Access Barriers and CAM Yu 98instrument using simple probit models. All of them are statistically significant at the 0.001 level. Boolean Probit Model. When the summary perceived affordability, accommodation, and accessibility access barr iers are modeled simultaneously, it is hypothesized that any summary perceived ac cess barrier will indu ce the use of CAM; namely, the summary perceived affordability access barrier or the summary perceived accommodation access barrier or the summary perceived acce ssibility access barrier influences the use of CAM. The probability of the happening of the summary perceived affordability access barrier or the summary perceived ac commodation access barrier or the summary perceived accessibility access barr ier can be calculated using a Boolean logic fashion; that is, 1 - the probability of none of these three summary perceived access barriers happens, assuming that the probabi lities are independent. Braumoeller (2003) explained that this kind of complex causation, known as substitutability , is a special case of causal complexity. The effects of these barr iers on the use of CAM are expected to be cumulative, but not in a simply addi tive form. Braumoeller elaborated, The problem is that complexity implies a particular form of nonadditivity that arise from the nature of the cumulation of the impact of the independent variables on the dependent variable: the presence or absence of one independent variable mitigates\u2014or in the extreme, nullifie s\u2014the impact of another. (p. 211) A simplified example of Boolean logic of summary perceived access barriers to conventional medicine and CAM usage is provided. Assuming CAM usage being attributed to the summary perceived affordability access barrier or the summary perceived accommodation access barrier or the summary perceived accessibility access Access Barriers and CAM Yu 99barrier, an individual with a 20% chance of using CAM ba sed on the summary perceived affordability access barrier alone, a 40% chance of using CAM based on the summary perceived accommodation access barrier alone , and a 40% chance of using CAM based on the summary perceived accessibility access barrier alone, rather than having a 100% (20% + 40%+ 40%) chance of using CAM with all three summary perceived access barriers, will score a 100% - (100% - 20%)\u00d7( = 71% (namely, 100% - the probability of none of these three summary perceived access barriers happens), assuming that th e probabilities are independent. As the vast majority of existing stat istical techniques fail to test complex causation, Braumoeller (2003, 2004, 2005) propo sed Boolean logit a nd probit procedures to model causal complexity. Boolean prob it and logit procedures can analyze the substitubility effect among dimensions of access barriers on the use of CAM and allow evaluation of individual dimensions of access barriers. The results of this analysis provide evidence needed for choosing policy in terventions to reduce access barriers by targeting the most important access barriers identified in this model focused on causal complexity. The following Boolean probit model desc ription, which was adapted from Braumoeller (2005), hypothesizes that indi vidual characteristics and {the summary perceived affordability access barrier or the summary perceived accommodation access barrier or the summary perceived accessibility a ccess barrier (namely, any one of these three summary perceived access barriers)}2 influence the use of CAM. 2 {} to emphasize the probability of the content within {} should be calculated first. Access Barriers and CAM Yu 100Equation 16 to 19 represent the models of a latent variable conditioning on a set of individual characteristics (CHAX ), the summary perceived affordability ) access barriers, respectively.

Covariates in the characteristics equation are the same as in a CAM use equation, including sex, age, race, ethni city, education, family povert y level, self-reported health status, health insurance, US citizenship, region, and year. After estimating three models, the treatme nt effect of an individual perceived access barrier dimension on the use of CAM is calculated following the same logics as described in the bivariate probit section for all three models. ATE av erages the treatment effects computed for each observation us ing their special values of observable characteristics for the entire population. Sa mpling weights are taken into account, and Access Barriers and CAM Yu 102standard errors of ATEs are calculated us ing a simulation technique proposed by Krinsky and Robb (1986, 1991). Krinsky and Robb (1986, 1991) have proposed a simulation methodology for estimating standard errors of non-linear functi ons of estimated parameters, such as ATEs. After a model is estimated, a parameter vector Tand a corresponding variance-covariance matrix Vare formed. Assuming parameters in this model have a multivariate normal distribution with mean Tand variance-covariance matrix V, a set of T can be randomly drawn from this distri bution and then used to calculate an ATE. After a significant number of draws (e.g., 1000) , an empirical distribution of ATEs is generated. In summary, this chapter described ho w CAM and perceived access barriers to conventional medicine were measured and grou ped, and what explanatory variables were included in the analyses. Three major modeli ng techniques -bivariate probit, multivariate probit, and Boolean probit models - were presented.

This chapter presents the results of the study in three sections. The first section descri bes the results of demographic analyses of pooled 1999 and 2002 NHIS data, including the an alysis of the populat ion in general (see Table 9), the proportion of th e population using CAM or pe rceiving access barriers (see Table 10) within the past 12 months, the desc riptive analysis of the population using at least one type of CAM (see Table 11), th e descriptive analys is of the population perceiving at least one access barrier (see Table 12), and the biva riate analysis of perceived access barriers and CAM usage (see Table 13). The second section describes the results of simple probit and bivariate probit analyses of perceived access barriers and th e utilization of CAM by subgroups classified according to the NCCAM (see Tables 14 to 19) as well as perceived access barriers and the subgroups of practitioner-provided and se lf-directed CAM usage (see Tables 20 to 25). The results of the simple probit and bivari ate probit models for a pair analysis of one perceived access barrier and one CAM subgr oup usage are presented in parallel for comparison. Both subsections contain two sets of tables. The first set of three tables shows the coefficients of perceived access ba rriers on CAM usage from simple probit and bivariate probit models and includes a table presenting summary perceived access barriers, a table showing perceived affordabili ty access barriers, and a table containing Access Barriers and CAM Yu 107perceived accommodation access barriers. A second set of tables shows ATEs of the models corresponding to the pr evious set of tables. Finally, the third section reveals the results of the three models that modeled three summary perceived access barriers together on the usage of any type of CAM. A statistical significance for all of the fi ndings is referred to significance at the 0.05 level unless otherwise noted. Descriptive Analysis of Pooled Data This section reports the results of dem ographic analysis for the pooled 1999 and 2002 NHIS data used in the Boolean probit model (N=48, 607). All results of demographic analysis for the sample used in the Boolean probit model are similar to those for the whole pooled 1999 and 2002 NHIS data. Table 9 shows the percentage distribution of demographic char acteristics of the sample used in the Boolean probit model. The majority of the population is female (approximately 51%), aged 35 to 44, White, has some college education, has a total family income at least 400% above the FPL, a nd is in self-reported excellent health. More than 82% of the population is covered by some form of health insurance and less than 8% does not have U.S. citizenship. The majority liv es in the South and speaks English. Over 40% of the population has children and over 80% has a regular source of healthcare. One quarter of the population smokes cigarettes a nd 67% drinks alcohol. Less than 2% of the population is ADL or IADL dependent. Cova riate smoking, drinking, ADL, IADL, and language are only used in bivariate probit models, not in the multivariate probit or Access Barriers and CAM Yu 108Boolean probit. Variables of smoking, drinki ng, ADL, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), and language used in intervie w contain less than 1.1% missing data in the final model. INSERT TABLE 9 HERE Table 10 shows the proportion of the population using CAM or perceiving access barriers to conventional medici ne. More than 40% of the population reported having used at least one type of CAM within the past 12 months. Over 40% of the population self-directs CAM usage whereas only roughly 10% sees a CAM provider for CAM usage. Around one third of the total population has us ed mind-body interventions within the past 12 months, the most common form of CAM, 19% has used biologically based therapies, the second most common form, 9% has used manipulative and body-based methods, 4% has used alternative medical systems, and 1% has used energy therapies. Almost 20% of the population percei ved at least one access barrier to conventional medicine, with 14% perceiving a ffordability access barriers, and 1% perc eiving accessibility access barriers. Among individual perceived access ba rriers, 10% of the population ca nnot afford dental care, 7% cannot afford prescription drugs, 6% cannot afford eyeglasses, 5% cannot get an appointment soon enough, 4% waits too long in the provider's office, 3% encounters closed provider offices, 2% cannot get thr ough on a telephone, 2% cannot afford mental health services, and 1% has no form of transportation. Access Barriers and CAM Yu 109 INSERT TABLE 10 HERE Table 11 reveals the demogra phic characteristics of the population that has used at least one type of CAM within the past 12 mont hs. Whereas near half of the females have used at least one type of CAM, only slight ly over one third of the males have done so. Over one third of the population within each age group has used at least one type of CAM. Almost half of the population in the 45 to 54 and 55 to 64 age groups has used at least one type of CAM. Overall, more minorities than Whites have used at least one type of CAM, with American Indians and Alaska Natives having the highest rate of usage. However, Hispanics have used CAM at a lower rate than have non-Hispanics. Among all the education groups, the population with post-undergraduate education uses CAM at the highest rate. More than half of the population with post-undergraduate education has used at l east one type of CAM within the past 12 months. The populations with incomes either less than 100% or 125% to 199% of the FPL have used CAM at much lower rates than have other income groups, with the population receiving an income higher than 400 % of the FPL having the highest rate of using at least one type of CAM. The population suffering from self-reported poor health reported the highest rate of using at least one type of CAM (ar ound 60%) among all the self-reported health groups whereas the self-reported excellent heal th group reported the lowest rate of using CAM (nearly 40%). The insured population has used CAM at a slightly higher rate than Access Barriers and CAM Yu 110has the uninsured population, a nd the citizen population has used CAM at a higher rate than has the noncitizen populat ion. The population living in th e West has the highest rate of using CAM whereas the population living in the Northeast has the lowest rate. The population without children has a slightly higher rate of CAM usage compared to the population with children. Around 44% of th e population with a regular source of healthcare has used CAM whereas only 36% of the population without a regular source of healthcare has. The nonsmoking population has used CAM at a higher rate (44%) than has the smoking population (39%). The alcohol drin king and nondrinking popul ations have used CAM at nearly the same rate. The proporti on of the ADL-dependent population that has used CAM is 16 percentage points higher than is that of the ADL-independent population. Similarly, the pr oportion of the IADL-depende nt population that has used CAM is 18 percentage points higher than is that of the IADL- independent population. Over half of the population that speaks a langua ge other than English or Spanish has used CAM whereas only one third of the Span ish-speaking population has used CAM. INSERT TABLE 11 HERE Table 12 shows that demographic characte ristics of the population that perceives at least one access barrier to conventional medi cine. Females perceive access barriers at a higher rate than do males. Younger people (thos e aged 18 to 24) perceive access barriers at a higher rate than do older people. All minorities excluding Asians perceive access Access Barriers and CAM Yu 111barriers at a higher rate than do Whites. In fact, Asians perceive access barriers at the lowest rate (14%) among a ll ethnic groups. American Indians and Alaska Natives perceive access barriers at th e highest rates (over 30%). There is little difference between Hispanics and non-Hispanics in their perc eption of access barriers. The population without a high school degree perceives access ba rriers at the highest rate (24%) whereas the population with post-undergraduate educatio n perceives access barriers at the lowest rate (14%). The population with incomes less than 124% of the FPL perceives access barriers at the highest rate (slightly over 30%) wher eas the population with incomes more than 400% of the FPL perceives access barrier s at the lowest rate (12%). Approximately half of the population repor ting poor health stat us perceives access barriers compared to only 12% of the populat ion reporting excellent health status. More than one third of the uninsured population perceives access barriers compared to only 16% of the insured population. The citizen population perceives access barriers at a slightly higher rate than does the noncitizen population. The population living the West perceive s access barriers at the highest rate whereas the population living in th e Northeast perceives access ba rriers at the lowest rate. The population without children perceives access ra tes at a slightly higher rate than does the population with children. The population without a regular source of healthcare perceives access barriers at a higher rate th an does the population with a regular source of healthcare. Access Barriers and CAM Yu 112Smokers perceive access barriers 10 pe rcentage points higher than do non-smokers. There is little diff erence between perceived acce ss barrier rates of alcohol drinkers and nondrinkers. Forty-three percent of the ADL-depe ndent population perceives access barriers compared to 19% of the ADL-independent popul ation. Similarly, nearly half of the IADL-dependent population perceives access barrie rs compared to about one-fifth of the IADL-independent population. The population sp eaking a language other than English or Spanish perceives access barriers at a higher rate than do the English- and Spanish-speaking populations. The Spanish- speaking population perceives access barriers at a lower rate than do the other two language populations. INSERT TABLE 12 HERE Table 13 shows that bivariate analysis of CAM use and perceived access barriers. All of the bivariate analyses show that each and every pair of CAM subgroups and perceived access barriers is statistically si gnificantly associated except for the summary perceived accessibility access barrier (lack of transportation) and manipulative and body-based methods, as well as the summary perceived accessibil ity access barrier and alternative medical systems. INSERT TABLE 13 HERE Access Barriers and CAM Yu 113Individual Perceived Access Barriers and In dividual Dimensions of Perceived Access Barriers This section describes in detail the an alysis results of the simple probit and bivariate probit models of perceived acce ss barriers and the utilization of CAM subgroups. The section first describes the cl assification of CAM subgroups according to the NCCAM (see Tables 14 to 19) then describes the reported CAM subgroups of practitioner-provided and self -directed CAM usage (see Tables 20 to 25). Overall, seventy-nine of the 96 (82.3%) pair analyses of perceived access barr iers and the usage of CAM were found to be positively associated at the 0.05 level of significance, 16 (16.7%) were found not to be statistically signifi cantly associated, and one was found to be negatively associated. Subgroups of CAM According to NCCAM Categories Coefficients of Perceived Access Barriers on CAM Usage from Simple Probit and Bivariate Probit Models Tables 14, 15, and 16 show the results fr om the simple probit and bivariate probit models of any type of CAM usage and the five CAM subgroups according to NCCAM categories, including mind-body intervention, bi ologically based ther apies, manipulative and body-based methods, alternative medical systems, and energy therapies listed according to popularity. To aid comprehension, th e cells that show statistically significant models at the 0.05 level of significance have been highlighted. For each pair of perceived access barriers and CAM, a statistically signi ficant bivariate probit model is highlighted Access Barriers and CAM Yu 114in green (dark gray). Bivariate probit m odels indicate perceived access barriers as endogenous variables on CAM usage and are st atistically significan t if the correlation coefficient (rho) is statistically significantly different from 0. If a bivariate probit model is not statistically significant and the corre sponding simple probit shows a statistically significant coefficient of perceived access barriers on CAM usag e, the cell of the statistically significant simple probit model is highlighted in yellow (light gray). Moreover, the coefficient of perceived access barriers in a statistic ally significant model is bolded if the coefficient itself is statistically significant. Table 14 displays the coefficient results of the simple probit and bivariate probit models of summary perceived access barriers including any perceived access barriers, the summary perceived affordability access barrier, the summary perceived accommodation access barrier, and the summary perceived a ccessibility access barrier on CAM usage. There are 24 pairs of perceived access barriers and CAM usage analysis in this table. For all of the simple probit models, all of the re sults show a statistically significant positive association at the 0.01 level of significan ce between summary perceived access barriers and CAM usage with the exception of the summary perceived accessibility access barrier and alternative medical systems usage. However, 6 of the 24 bivariate probit models are statistically significant. In other words, perceived access barriers are endogenous in these 6 models. These 6 statistically significant bivariate probit models provide different information regarding the relationships between perceived access barr iers and CAM usage from the conclusions drawn from simple probit models. The pos itive association between the summary Access Barriers and CAM Yu 115perceived affordability access barrier and manipulative and body-based methods in a simple probit model is actually statistically insign ificant if the endoge nous property of the summary perceived affordability access barrier is taken into account in a bivariate probit model. The magnitudes of the positive associa tions between perceive d access barriers and CAM usage in the remaining 5 bivariate probit models are la rger than are those in the simple probit models. For the biologically based therapies usage, none of summary perceived access barriers is endogenous.

Modeling All Three Summary Perceive d Access Barriers With CAM Use Access Barriers and CAM Yu 128This section provides the analysis resu lts of modeling three summary perceived access barriers together on the use of any type of CAM with simple probit, multivariate probit, and Boolean probit models. Coefficients of Summary Perceived Access Barriers on any CAM Usage from Simple Probit, Multivariate Probit, and Boolean Probit Models Table 26 shows the different coefficient results from modeling all three summary perceived access barriers together on any CAM usage in the simple probit, multivariate probit, and Boolean probit models. In the simple probit model, all the coefficients of the three summary perceived access barriers are stat istically significant at the 0.05 level. The coefficients of summary pe rceived affordability and acco mmodation access barriers are statistically significant at the 0.001 level and are at least twic e as large in magnitude as that of the summary perceived accessibility access barrier. The coefficient of the summary percei ved affordability access barrier is statistically positively significant whereas the coefficient of the summary perceived accessibility access barrier is statistically negatively significant at the 0.001 level of significance in the multivariate probit model in which all three summary perceived access barriers are treated as endogenous. The summar y perceived affordability and accessibility access barriers are significantly endogenous. However, the correlation coefficient between the equation of the summary perc eived accommodation access barrier and CAM usage is not statistically significant at th e 0.05 level; that is, the summary perceived accommodation access barrier is not endogenous in this multivariate probit model.

The actual dist ribution of any CAM use is around 44 percent of the population, compared with an estimat ed 41 percent from the multivariate probit model and 42 percent from the Boolean probit model. In contrast, a simple probit model only estimated 13 percent of the popula tion using any type of CAM. INSERT TABLE 28 HERE Table 29 reveals how well each model perf ormed, as judged from the association of the actual value of any CAM use with the estimated value.

The rest of this chapter summarizes and discusse s the results and their implications. This dissertation examined whether the subjective evaluation of access regarding entry (gaining entrance to the conventional h ealth care system in terms of perceived access barriers to conventional medicine) is pos itively related to the utilization of CAM. This study analyzed relationships between various subgroups of CAM, classified by nature of the mode (mind-body interventions, biologically based ther apies, manipulative and body-based methods, alternative medical sy stems, or energy therapies) or the way through which CAM is acquired (practitione r-provided or self-directed), and three dimensions of perceived access barriers to conv entional medicine (hereinafter referred to as summary perceived affordability, accommoda tion, or accessibility access barriers). Affordability access barriers relate to the price of health care services and clients' ability to pay. Accommodation access barriers are defined with respect to health care organizational operating modes and clients' capacity to accomm odate. Accessibility access barriers examine the locations of health care organizations and clients' ability to approach. Each individual perceived access ba rrier, which composes either the summary perceived affordability or accommodation acce ss barriers, was also examined separately. In addition, summary indicators for any type of CAM use or any perceived access barriers were constructed, separately. Access Barriers and CAM Yu 165 Review of the Methodology The first part of this dissertation anal yzes the relationships of pairs of one perceived access barrier (i ndividual item, individual di mension, and the summary indicator, separately) to conventional me dicine and a CAM subgroup using bivariate probit models to account for possible e ndogeneity of perceived access barriers. The coefficient results of bivariate probit models were then compared with those from simple probit models. The goal is to show that biases might result from treating endogenous perceived access barriers to conventional medi cine as exogenous in simple probit models. The second part of this dissertation evalua ted the relationships between three summary perceived access barriers to conventional medi cine together and the use of any type of CAM using (1) a Boolean probit model, wh ich utilizes product functional forms capturing complex causality, and (2) a multivariate probit model, which takes the endogeneity of three summary perceived acces s barriers into account at the same time. The evaluation then compared results of th ese two models with those from a simple probit model, which treats all three summar y perceived access barr iers as exogenous and assumes their effects to have an additive linear form. Summary of the Results Summary perceived access barriers in clude any perceived access barriers (prevalence rate=19%), the summary percei ved affordability access barrier (14%), the summary perceived accommodation access barrier (8%), and the summary perceived accessibility access barrier (1%). Positive a ssociations are found between summary Access Barriers and CAM Yu 166perceived access barriers and the use of CAM subgroups, with a few exceptions. No statistically significant associations exist between the summary perceived affordability access barrier and the use of manipulative a nd body-based methods, as well as between the summary perceived accessibility access barrier and the use of alternative medical systems. However, there is a statistically significantly negative correlation between the summary perceived accessibility access barrie r and the use of self-directed CAM. On average, the summary perceived accessi bility and accommodation access barriers increase the probability of using any type of CAM by 46% and 34%, respectively. By contrast, the summary perceived affordability access barrier increases the probability of any CAM use by only 16%. Individual perceived affordability access barr iers include inability to afford dental care (10%), prescription drugs (7%), eyeglasses (6%), and mental he alth services (2%). Each individual perceived affordability acce ss barrier affects the use of CAM subgroups, to varying degrees. Inability to afford dental care increases the probability of usage in every CAM subgroup, with the exception of manipulative and body-based methods. Inability to afford prescription drugs only in creases the probability of using biologically based therapies, energy therapies, and pract itioner-provided CAM. Inability to afford eyeglasses has effects similar to the inability to afford prescription drugs, but is also related to the use of alternative medicine sy stems. Inability to afford mental health services increases th e probability of using mind-body in terventions, biologically based therapies, alternative medical systems, and energy therapies. Access Barriers and CAM Yu 167Individual perceived accommodation access ba rriers include inability to get an appointment soon enough (5%), waiting too long in the office (4%), of fices that are not open (3%), and inability to get through on the telephone (2%). All of these variables increase the probability of using any CAM and using every CAM subgroup, with various degrees of magnitudes. All of these perc eived accommodation access barriers increase the probability of using mind-body interventions by > 30%. Inability to get an appointment soon enough increases the pr obability of using any CAM, mind-body interventions, and self-dir ected CAM by over 40%. Inability to get through on the telephone has a similar effect. Moreover, inability to get th rough on the telephone increases the probabili ty of using biologically based th erapies by over 50%. Offices that are not open increase the probability of using any CAM and mind-body interventions by over 40%. In light of modeling three summary perc eived access barriers simultaneously in the simple probit model, the summary perceived affordability, accommodation, and accessibility access barriers increase the pr obability of using any type of CAM on average by 14%, 13%, and 5%, respectively. In the multivariate probit model, however, the summary perceived affordability access barrier increases the probability of using any type of CAM by 21%, whereas the summary perceived accessibility access barrier decreases the probability of using any type of CAM by a significant 25%, on average. The summary perceived accommodation access barri er has no significant effect in this model. From the Boolean probit model, how ever, the summary perceived affordability, Access Barriers and CAM Yu 168accommodation, and accessibility access barriers increase the probability of using any type of CAM in almost equal magnitude s by 12%, 10%, and 12%, respectively. Discussion In general, perceived access barriers ar e positively related to the use of CAM. Analysis of summary measures of any t ype of CAM usage and any perceived access barrier shows that any perceived access barrier increases the probability of using any type of CAM by 16%, on average. These summary vari ables were constructed as \"yes,\" if any individual questions were answered as \"y es\" in relation to CAM usage or perceived access barriers, respectively. This finding is cons istent with that of Ritchie et al. (2005); these authors, however, did not control unobser ved variables that affect CAM usage and perceived access barriers. Nevertheless, the various relationships be tween different perceived access barriers and different CAM subgroup usage found in this dissertation show a clear picture that perceived access barriers and CAM are not homogenous. For instance, after controlling unobserved variables that affect both CAM usage and perceived access barriers, the summary perceived accessibility access barrier increases the probability of using any type of CAM by almost 50%, while the summary perceived accommodation access barrier increases the probability of using any type of CAM by over 30%. By contrast, the summary perceived affordability access barr ier increases the probability of using any type of CAM by only 16%. All summary perceived access barriers increase the probabilities of using self-directed CAM to nearly twice the magn itudes of those using Access Barriers and CAM Yu 169practitioner-provided CAM. Among individual affordability access barriers, inability to afford dental care increases all subtypes of CAM usage, w ith the exception of manipulative and body-based methods (chiroprac tics and massage); inability to afford prescription drugs, however, only increases th e use of biologically based therapies and energy therapies. These findings indicate th at using summary indicators of CAM or perceived access barriers ar e not appropriate for infe rring relationships between individual CAM subgroups and individual perceived access barrier s to conventional medicine. Overall, the difference between the amount s of various perceived access barriers increasing the probability of CAM usage is on ly a matter of degree. Non-financial access barriers (those of perceived accessibility or accommodation) and financial access barriers (those of perceived affordability) tend to have different impacts on CAM usage because of their different natures. As a whole, non-financial access barriers have higher likelihoods than do financial access barriers to increase CAM use. As stated in Chapter 1, it is important to distinguish financial and non-financial access barriers because they require different interventions. For instance, health insurance is intended to decrease affordability access ba rriers. Although health insurance, both private and public, is found to be more likely to decrease perceive d affordability access barriers when compared with the uninsured, public health insura nce tends to increase perceived accommodation access barriers when compared to the uninsured.3 The possibility exists that public health insura nce providers practice in a different way than 3 Results from the full models are not show n, but are available upon request. Access Barriers and CAM Yu 170private health insurance providers, due to the coverage or reimbursement of public health insurance. Similarly, Bair et al (2001) f ound that asthma patients covered by the state's Medicaid program were more likely to repor t perceived access barriers. Therefore, if public health insurance is expanded to cover the uninsured with the current design, it may decrease perceived affordab ility access barriers, yet meanwhile increase perceived accommodation access barriers. As a result, insurance alone does not guarantee equal access to conventional health care. The unexpected statistically significant negative correlation between the summary perceived accessibility access barrier and th e use of self-directe d CAM is noteworthy. Counter-intuitively, people who percei ve accessibility access barriers use fewer self-directed CAM, which is supposedly easy to obtain with low or no variable costs. This result is found in a significant bivariate probit model, which sugge sts that significant unmeasured factors positively affect both CAM usage and perceived acces sibility access barriers. This unobserved factor could be the need for control, identified in the studies of Montbriand (1995) as well as Verhoef and Wh ite (2002). People with a stronger need to control may be more likely to self-treat and to perceive access barriers, given the same circumstances as people with less need to cont rol. Further investigation is warranted to understand the role of the need to control on perceived ac cess barriers to conventional medicine or CAM usage. Another surprising finding is that positively significant connections exist between perceived access barriers to conventional me dicine and the use of practitioner-provided CAM. A hypothesis would be th at perceived access barriers to conventional medicine are Access Barriers and CAM Yu 171insignificantly or even negatively associat ed with practitioner-provided CAM. Although summary affordability or accessibility access barriers only slightly increase, by 6 percentage points, the probability of us ing practitioner-provided CAM, the summary accommodation access barrier increases the prob ability of using practitioner-provided CAM by 20%, on average. People who have trouble accessing conventional medicine providers due to their inabili ty to get appointments soon e nough or to get through on the phone are highly likely to use practitioner-p rovided CAM, which might be easily found in the neighborhood. In addition, all individual perceive d accommodation access barriers increase both practitioner-provided and self-d irected CAM usage, to a va rying degree. All of these access barriers have almost twic e as large an effect on self-directed CAM use as that on practitioner-provided CAM use. Again, th e easier access of se lf-directed CAM may contribute to this phenomenon. Of particular interest is that more individual perceived affordability access barriers are positively related with practiti oner-provided CAM use (three out of four barriers) than with self-directed CAM us e (one out of four barriers). However, self-directed CAM should be le ss expensive, or with no variable costs, compared to practitioner-provided CAM. This finding suggest s that people with affordability access barriers have unmet medical care needs that they think require a provider's attention. Indeed, Paramore (1997) found that people vi siting CAM practiti oners had significant unmet needs for medical care. Therefore, these people opt to see a relatively less expensive provider given the assumption that alte rnative medicine is cheaper or easier to Access Barriers and CAM Yu 172find in their neighborhoods. Pagan and Paul y (2005) provided a similar argument regarding relatively less costly CAM. Access barriers to prescription drugs have long been a concern. People who cannot afford prescription drugs are f ound to increase the probability of using biologically based therapies by 10%. These biol ogically based therapies include natural herbs, special diets, or high doses of megavitamins. If people simply substitute or complement these biologically based ther apies with prescription drugs without a provider's supervision, the pot ential harmful interaction between biologically based therapies and prescription drugs could cause serious health problems. Health care providers should ask their pati ents about their use of bi ologically based therapies, especially those patients with affordability access barriers. Income is commonly used to measure affordability. However, the summary perceived affordability access barrier is positiv ely associated with CAM usage, even after adjusting income. This finding supports the argument by Atella et al. (2005) that perceived affordability barriers should be more multidimensional and representative of respondents' economic, financial, and social si tuations. Therefore, perceived affordability access barriers are possibly better predictors th an income of the likelihood of using CAM. Pagan and Pauly (2005) argue that the po ssibility exists that people using CAM might delay or forego needed medical care due to costs because they have less money available. This argument weakens the likeli hood of perceived affordability access barriers to conventional medicine increasing CAM usag e since the association in models could come from both direction. Access Barriers and CAM Yu 173However, it is less likely that CAM usage is one of the major causes of perceived accommodation access barriers. Non-financial acce ss barriers are related to how health care organizations operate, which in turn might relate to reimbursement systems of health insurance. Insurance companies could improve accommodation access by offering financial incentives for physicians to offer office hours in the early morning, evenings, nights, or on weekends. Schoen et al. (2006) reported that near ly 30 percent of the primary care physicians in the U.S. do not of fer office hours in the early morning (before 8:30 a.m.), evening hours (after 6:00 p.m.), or any weekend hours at all. Moreover, 60 percent of primary care physicians do not have after-hours arrangements, not including the ER. It is highly possible that these facts contribute to pe rceived accommodation access barriers to conventional medicine. Nati onal reforms might be needed to improve accommodation access. Similar national policie s can be found in the Netherlands and Australia (Schoen et al., 2006). In these count ries, far fewer primary care physicians than in the U.S. reported either no office hours dur ing these unusual times, or no after-hours arrangements. It can be seen from the model comparison that serious biases arise from simple probit models when variables of interest are endogenous. This endogeneity may result from unobserved factors includi ng health beliefs (such as va lues concerning health and illness, attitudes toward health services , culture, or knowledge about diseases), characteristics of health care organizations (s uch as the locations or operation of health care organizations), or prices or types of hea lth care services (such as charges for health care services or co-payment and co-insurance for health insurance). It is difficult to Access Barriers and CAM Yu 174include variables related to health care orga nizations in population su rvey data because of their lack of availability, in general. Ind eed, no variables regarding the above information are available in the public-use NHIS for 1999 and 2002. The only variable that could be used to roughly adjust the dist ribution of health care organiza tions is region of residence, which is only categorized into so uth, east, west, and Midwest. It is worth a try to use a bivariate probit model when a suspicion arises that variables of interest could be endogenous due to unobserved f actors, in order to avoid biased estimates and mistaken inference. Even when a bivariate probit is not statistically significant at the 0.05 level of significance, the large correl ation coefficients found in many bivariate probit models (for example, the summary perceived accessibility access barrier and mind-body interventions) should be taken into consideration. Consequently, different coefficient estimates of perceived access barriers on CAM usage from simple probit models should be reviewed and interpreted with caution. It may be difficult to disentangle the co mpensating effect between the correlation coefficient and the coefficient of the potenti ally endogenous variable of interest in a bivariate probit model. Analyzing simulated data of different marginal probability distributions across the two binary outcomes in a bivariate probit model, Monfardini and Radice (2006) concluded that the correlation co efficient and its standard error strongly depend on the features of the data. Difficulty in estimating arising in unbalanced data in which the potentially endogenous variable is less frequently observed assuming a value one. The less frequently observed is the poten tially endogenous variable of interest, the more troublesome is the estimation of the correlation coefficient. Furthermore, the Access Barriers and CAM Yu 175coefficient of the endogenous variable is estim ated with low precision. They suggest that much information is required to improve th e precision of the coefficient estimation, regardless of the estimation of correlation co efficient. The analysis of the summary perceived accessibility access barrier falls in such a situation in ge neral because only 1% of population reported it. The failure to reject the correlation coeffi cient different from zero found in the analysis of the summary perceived accessibility access barrier and mind-body interventions might have contri buted to the inefficient estimation. Monfardini and Radice (2006) also cau tion researchers with respect to the statistically significant finding of the potentially endogenous va riable of interest in a simple probit model but then identifying insi gnificance of both the correlation coefficient and the coefficient of the potentially endoge nous variable in a bi variate probit model. They conclude that this phenomenon indica tes a practical identification problem, which causes the difficulty to distinguish the co mpensating effect between the correlation coefficient and the coefficient of the poten tially endogenous variable, and thus needs more information to fix. An example of this c oncern in this dissertation is the analysis of the summary perceived accessibility access barrier and biologically based therapies. It is suggested that the interac tion among access barriers often produces a cumulative effect, making access more difficult (Scheer et al., 2003). The impact of all three summary perceived access barriers on CAM use differs dramatically in multivariate probit and Boolean probit models. From the multivariate probit model, the summary perceived affordability access barrier increase s the probability of using any type of CAM by 21%, on average, whereas the summary perceived accessibility access barrier Access Barriers and CAM Yu 176decreases the probability of using any type of CAM by 25%. Meanwhile, the summary perceived accommodation access barrier has no significant influence on CAM use. Findings from the multivariate probit model show that significant unobserved factors affect summary perceived access barriers and CA M use; they also have an effect among summary perceived access barriers. This findi ng supports the argument of Penchansky and Thomas (1981) that access barriers are mu lti-dimensional and interrelated. However, the opposite signs of the coefficients of thes e two perceived access barriers will cancel out each other's effect when both of they are present. In contrast, all three summary perceived access barriers increase the probability of using any type of CAM in a similar manner in the Boolean probit model. Namely, any one of the summary perceived access barriers increases the probability of using CAM by 10% to 12%. Results from this Boolean probit model demonstrate that characteristics and {the summary perceived affordability access barrier or the summary perceived accommodation access barrier or the summary perceived acce ssibility access barrier} influence the probability of using any CAM. This substitutability complex causality among perceived access barriers cannot be tested usi ng linear models. Unlike multivariate probit models, whic h allow unrestrained correlations among perceived access barriers, Boolean probit m odels assume that these three perceived access barriers are independent. Moreover, Boolean probit models assume that the impacts of three perceived access barriers on CAM usage are cumutive in a Boolean logic fashion, which cannot be captured in a linear form as in multivariate probit models. As shown in Table 29, both multivariate probit and Boolean probit models outperform the Access Barriers and CAM Yu 177simple probit model in terms of prediction. In addition, the Bool ean probit model very slightly outperforms the multivariate probit model in prediction. However, it is unclear which model tells the true relationship betw een summary perceived access barriers and CAM usage because their assumptions are diffe rent, and each has its own strengths and limitations. Boolean probit modeling is a relatively new modeling technique. Currently, few applied studies have used this model (Bra umoeller, 2003; Braumoeller, 2005; Bornmann, 2005). Furthermore, no previous studies have modeled perceived acces s barriers as being multidimensional, and no studies have used either multivariate probit or Boolean probit models with regard to CAM usage, to the author's knowledge. No comparison with previous studies can be provided at this time. In bivariate probit models, two instrume nt variables\u2014the presence of children aged under 18 in a family (1= yes, 0=otherwis e) and the presence of a regular source of healthcare (1= yes, 0=otherwise)\u2014were chos en for the equations of perceived access barriers because they were both found to be related to perceive d access barriers in the literature (Ahmed, Lemkau, Neal eigh, & Mann, 2001; Kasper, 2000). It is plausible that these two variables are related to any CA M use only through perceived access barriers, making them valid instruments. Conditioning on other covariates in a equation, the presence of children in a family is sta tistically significant in every perceived access barrier equation, whereas the presence of a re gular source of healthcare is insignificant in equations of any perceived access barriers, the summary perceived accessibility access Access Barriers and CAM Yu 178barrier, cases of no transportation, inability to afford prescription drugs, or inability to afford mental health services. In the multivariate probit mode, the presence of children in a family and the presence of a regular source of healthcare were used as instrument variables in the equations of the summary perceived accessibility access barrier and the summary perceived accommodation access barrier, resp ectively. Another instrument variable\u2014 attitude (worry about cost of conventional medicine; 1= ye s, 0=otherwise)\u2014was chosen for the equation of the summary perceived affo rdability access barrier. There is little reason to think that attitude (worry about cost of conve ntional medicine) has direct impact on CAM use, not through perceived affo rdability access barrie rs. All instrument variables are statistically significant at the 0.01 level of significance in this multivariate probit model. Two issues have bearing on instrument variable estimations: (1) invalid instruments (which are also rela ted to the error term of the equation of outcome, as is the endogenous variable of interest), and (2) weak instruments, which are only weakly correlated with the endogenous variab le (Murray, 2006). Although Murray (2006) summarized various tests for test ing the validity and strength of instruments, these tests are intended for two-stage least-squares estimation, not bivariate or multivariate probit models. It is not clear how these tests are applicable in the context of bivariate or multivariate probit models. Further inves tigation in this area is critical. Classification bias might arise because of the way that CAM modalities are classified into practitioner-provided or se lf-directed. As mentioned in the methodology Access Barriers and CAM Yu 179section, CAM modalities are classified into practitioner-provided or self-directed according to the way through which they are acquired although some of them could be obtained through either ways. In the NHI S 2002, small proportion of respondents reported seeing practitioners fo r natural herbs, homeopathic treatment, special diets, high-dose or megavitamin therapy, or rela xation techniques. However, these are no similar questions asking how CAM is acquire d in the NHIS 1999. To make consistent classification of the data from both years, these modalities are then assigned as self-directed CAM because the very large propo rtion of these users we re self-directed as found in 2002. This classification mi ght cause classification biases. To evaluate this potential bias, an anal ysis of comparing two classifications\u2014one adopted in this dissertation is classifying na tural herbs, homeopathic treatment, special diets, high-dose or megavitamin therapy, or relaxation techniques as self-directed, and the other is classifying users of these modalitie s as practitioner-provi ded if they reported seeing a practitioner for these modalitie s\u2014was conducted using the NHIS 2002. The results of this analysis sugge st that findings from both cla ssifications are very close. There are no significant changes in any findi ngs with one exception in simple probit models. The summary accessibility access ba rrier is positively associated with practitioner-provided CAM in th e latter classification at the 0.05 level of significance, but insignificantly associated in the former classification (p=0.066) . However, the coefficient estimates are not statistically significantly different. The difference between statistical findings could simply happen due to chance and be falsely reported significant because a large number of tests were performed. Access Barriers and CAM Yu 180Many people who perceive access barriers to conventional medicine use CAM. However, perceived access barriers to conventio nal medicine are not likely to be the only reason why people use CAM. Consumer desire for CAM insurance coverage may drive more health insurance programs to cover it. On one hand, health in surance that covers CAM can improve access to it for the insured in general, and the in sured with perceived access barriers to conventional medicine, in particular. CAM insurance coverage might be a way to alleviate the bad health c onsequences resulting from access barriers to conventional medicine. On the other hand, wh ether CAM health insurance coverage can improve population health or decrease current escalating health care expenditure is still unclear. Further study regarding how people c hoose between conven tional medicine and alternative modalities, both, or none, under what circumstances, their contributing factors, and their out come are critical. The results of this dissertation should be interpreted with cau tion. The design of this study is cross-sectional, which makes causal inference troublesome. However, the universe of NHIS sampling is national, ma king generalization hi ghly possible. In addition, several significant ATE findings are very small, with some being only 1%. These significant findings are probably due to large sample sizes and might not indicate strong substantive significance, meaningfulness, or importance from a practical point of view. This dissertation did not eval uate the availability and acceptability dimensions of access barriers identified by Penchansky and Th omas (1981) because relevant data were not available from the NHIS. Moreover, ther e are no data on the severity of perceived Access Barriers and CAM Yu 181access barriers to conventional medicine in NHI S; therefore, what degree of perceived access barriers to conventional medicine will influence CAM usage cannot be examined by any study at the present time. Notwithstanding its limitations, this dissertation adds substantially to the understanding of how CAM usage is related to perceived acce ss barriers to conventional medicine. In previous small-scale qualitative studies, CAM usage has been identified as one of many coping strategies adopte d by people who face access barriers to conventional medicine. By using a national repr esentative large data set, this dissertation quantitatively examined the study hypothese s regarding the relationships between perceived access barriers to conventiona l medicine and CAM usage. Thus, this dissertation contributes to th e literature by identifying a num ber of significantly positive relationships between percei ved access barriers to conve ntional medicine and CAM usage. Additionally, this di ssertation highlighted the neces sity of measuring perceived access barriers multidimensionally and clas sifying CAM approaches into more homogenous subgroups. Lastly, this dissert ation demonstrated the importance of selecting statistical models based on theore tic logic rather than convention to test hypotheses. To the best of the authors' knowledg e, this study is the first to apply Boolean probit model to health services research. In policy analysis, research ers often want to quantify the effect of a binary variable of interest on a binary outcome. However, this type of analysis is inadequate without the use of the appropriate analytic techniques because a simple probit can only control observed confounders. When there ar e concerns that unobserved factors, Access Barriers and CAM Yu 182measurement errors, or simulta neity could affect both the va riable of interest and the outcome, it is valuable to use a bivariate probit model to avoid biased estimates and mistaken inferences from the use of a simp le probit model. If more than one binary variable of interest needs to be evaluated simultaneously, multivariate probit models can be used to estimate a joint model of more than two probit equations. This model allows the error terms of equations to be multivar iate normally distributed to control for unobserved confounders, therefore resulting in unbiased estimate s and statistical inferences. Little or no attention has been given to modeling causa l complexity in applied research, which may be attributed to the inabil ity to model this type of relationship using statistical software until the creation of Boolean logit and pr obit in Stata in 2003. Causal complexity, which models effects of independe nt variables in a cumutive but not additive manner, might provide answers that will furt her our understanding of how factors interact with each other. As the popularity of CAM increases while concern over access to conventional care continues, more research investigating wh ether the use of CAM, and if so how much and which type, can improve health or decr ease disability in the population perceiving access barriers to conventional medicine will become increasingly important. In order to fully understand the consequences of the increased use of CAM among individuals perceiving access barriers to conventional me dicine on population health, future studies addressing the issues investigated in the pr esent study with respect to clinical outcomes and cost effectiveness to choose appropriate policy interventions will be necessary.
