Shearer, Ph.D. Patricia Ann King, Ph.D., L.P.C SINCE JOHN AUGUSTUS introduced the notion of probation in 1841, the number of probationers in the United States has grown exponentially. Today, probation is the most widelyused sentencing option in the United States. As of 2001, there were 3,932,751 adult men andwomen on probation (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2002). Of this number, 22 percent (870,000)were women. Breaking the total down racially, one-third (1,228,700) were African-American,one-half were white (2,175,600), one-eighth (469,800) were Hispanic, and persons of other racerepresented 2 percent (58,600). Two of the most demographically diverse states, Texas andCalifornia, led the nation in number of adults supervised in the community, together accountingfor over one million persons. Furthermore, more than 2.1 million adults entered probationsupervision during 2001. Since 1995, the annual number of probation entries has increased by 34percent. Probationers are sentenced for a wide variety of offenses, and Bureau of JusticeStatistics (BJS) data indicate that half were convicted of a felony and that a quarter wereconvicted of drug law violations. Also, three out of four were under active supervision, requiringthat they report regularly to a probation authority. Clearly, the vast numbers of personssupervised are a diverse group who exhibit a wide variety of treatment and supervision concernsthat probation officers are expected to address. The questions and issues addressed in thisdiscussion speak directly to the role of multicultural competencies in probation as officerssupervise this diverse group of offenders. From \"Nothing Works\" to \"What Works?\" From its inception in the 1800s, probation was considered a form of treatment. John Augustus, acknowledged as the first probation officer, sought out offenders whom he thought could be rehabilitated. This idea dominated correctional thinking for many years. Cullen and Gendreau(2001) assert that positivism was the prevailing philosophy during the early years of moderncriminology, with very specific ways of both explaining and controlling crime. They concludedthat five principles underlie this philosophy. First, crime has definite causes that can beestablished through systematic scientific study. Second, punishment has limited effectiveness inan offender's rehabilitation. Third, interventions should be matched to the offender. Fourth, usingthe correctional system to reform offenders is the only rational approach to crime control. Andfinally, treatment must be individualized because the causes of crime differ for each person. Leading writers in the field argued strenuously for these principles. For example, Sutherland (1939) asserted that correctional interventions would be ineffective unless they targeted to changethe actual causes of crime. He argued that offenders need contact with law-abiding role modelsand that treatment and supervision should be individualized. The Gluecks (1950) and Taft (1960)theorized that because crime has multiple causes, the scientific method should be utilized toferret out the causes so that, once they were known, effective treatments could be provided. Cressey (1958) also saw the value in rehabilitation. While he believed that there were problems with correctional rehabilitation, he did not favor abolishing the concept. Rather, he believed thatthe appropriate use of science could establish effective principles of rehabilitation. This attitudeprevailed through the 1960s, but the 1970s brought a radical ideological change attributed to thework of one man, Robert Martinson. In an article entitled \"What works? Questions and answers about prison reform,\" Martinson (1974) revealed in a study of 231 program evaluations that very little worked in rehabilitatingoffenders. Although other researchers maintained that there were serious flaws in the study,Martinson's argument became the rallying cry of a new generation of criminologists. Basically,the \"nothing works\" philosophy encompasses several principles, as outlined by Cullen andGendreau (2001). First, nothing works effectively or reliably to rehabilitate offenders, andtherefore nothing the state does to reduce crime will work. Further, since prisons have no effecton crime rates, only the most serious offenders should be incarcerated. Others should be placedinto community corrections programs that will not work either, but at least the offenders will beless harmed. Additionally, criminologists should not engage in what Cullen and Gendreau (2001)refer to as a penal science, or becoming tools of the state. Finally, they assert that all crimeresults from structural factors such as social and economic inequality. Thus, rehabilitation effortscan never be successful because they do not change the root structural causes of crime. The \"nothing works\" philosophy remained prevalent throughout the 1980s and 1990s, during which even community corrections became control oriented. Cullen and Gendreau (2001) arguedthat criminologists spend an inordinate amount of time showing what does not work instead ofexamining programs and treatments that actually do work. By the end of the 1900s, researchersbegan to do exactly that. As a result, a list of principles that work with some offenders at leastsome of the time has been identified. What Works? To determine what works, Cullen and Gendreau (2001) outlined a list of principles. First,scientific criminology is the basis for effective correctional intervention and should be used toexpose \"knowledge\" that is not based on evidence. That is, effective interventions target tochange the causes of recidivism. Since many correctional techniques simply do not work (e.g.,boot camps, \"Scared Straight,\" and other punitive programs), states should stop using them.Third, science should be used to construct what does work with offenders and employ treatmentsthat can and should be tested for their efficacy. According to Cullen and Gendreau (2001), it islegitimate for criminologists to produce knowledge that can reduce crime. In addition,criminologists should not restrict themselves to structural analysis, because individual-levelanalysis is also appropriate. Finally, scientific criminology will result in more good than acriminology that ignores what works. These authors make a compelling argument for theadherence to a \"what works\" philosophy. Thus, the question becomes, what does work in thetreatment and supervision of offenders? Andrews, Zinger, Hoge, Bonta, Gendreau, & Cullen (1990) found that appropriate interventions reduce recidivism by as much as 25 percent, whereas inappropriate interventions can actuallyincrease recidivism. They also noted that appropriate treatment programs set in the communityproduce even greater reductions in recidivism than prison-based programs. According to Latessa,Cullen, and Gendreau (2002), successful treatment approaches have certain variables in common.First, certain variables that are known predictors of offender recidivism include: antisocialvalues, antisocial peers, poor self-control, self-management, and pro-social problem solvingskills, family dysfunction, and past criminology. Accordingly, intervention programs that ignorethese variables are doomed to fail. Second, a growing body of literature addresses programs thatdo not appear to work, such as boot camps, punishment or control oriented programs, wildernessprograms, psychological interventions that are nondirective or insight-oriented, and radicalnonintervention. These authors assert that effective correctional interventions share certain characteristics. First, aspecific organizational culture exhibits well-defined goals, ethical principles, and a history of efficiently responding to issues that affect treatment facilities. The organizations are characterized by staff cohesion, support for service training, self-evaluation, and the use of outside resources.Successful programs base their treatment programs on empirical research, and staff members areprofessionally trained and have extensive clinical experience. Clients are assessed in terms ofrisk and needs. Assessment instruments are widely used and the client's responsivity is alsoconsidered. Successful programs aim to change a variety of criminogenic traits by utilizingbehavioral/social learning/cognitive behavioral therapies that are targeted to high-risk offenders.Program therapists also engage in core therapeutic practices, including anti-criminal modeling,effective reinforcement and disapproval, problem-solving techniques, structured learningprocedures for skill building, effective use of authority, cognitive self-change, relationshippractices, and motivational interviewing. Agencies recognize that occasionally referrals must bemade; thus, one agency is not expected to serve all client needs. Finally, effective agenciespursue evaluation processes and are vitally interested in program audits, consumer needs, andrecidivism rates. Essentially, if they adhere to certain principles, probation agencies can becomeeffective change agents for many offenders. Research has shown that certain types of programsdo make a difference. Gendreau (1996) has written extensively regarding effective intervention. He notes that a number of factors contribute to successful programs. First, services should be intensive and behavioral innature. For example, well-designed programs might reward offenders with token economies,modeling, or cognitive- behavioral interventions. He also suggests that treatment and supervisionare more effective when matched with offender risk level. As such, high-risk offenders are morelikely than low-risk offenders to benefit from programs. The most promising programs targetantisocial attitudes, styles of thinking and behavior, peer associations, chemical dependency, andself-control issues. Gendreau (1996) asserts that offenders, therapists, and programs should bematched. In other words, it makes little sense to treat all offenders as though they have identicalpersonality traits, attitudes, and beliefs. The responsivity principle, as it has become known,matches treatment with an offender's type and a therapist's style. Therapists should relate tooffenders in interpersonally sensitive and constructive ways. The interpersonally skilled counselorexhibits clarity in communication, warmth, humor, openness, the ability to relate affect tobehavior and to set appropriate limits. The evidence shows that it is possible to rehabilitate certain offenders, but their rehabilitation depends upon the type of treatment offered, responsivity principles, and matching. In otherwords, the methods used to treat an offender should be the ones to which an offender responds,namely relationship variables. The success of a program hinges on the type of relationship thatthe officer can cultivate with the offender. Because offenders are a diverse group, there is agrowing body of research regarding their diverse needs. Multicultural Counseling Competencies Key elements that exist in good therapeutic relationships include establishing rapport, adapting to individual needs, being genuine and caring, and empowering the client. Unfortunately, for avariety of reasons, these key elements may be lacking. One of the major impediments to building an effective relationship may be found in cross- cultural barriers. Parrott (1997) notes that contemporary helpers realize that a client's culturemust be understood if counseling is to be effective. Culture is the totality of ideals, beliefs,skills, tools, customs, and institutions into which each member in society is born (Sue & Sue,1999). Cultural differences can lead to difficulties in developing the rapport that is necessary tobuild a helping relationship between the offender and the probation officer. Parrott asserts thatethnic-minority clients often do not take advantage of counseling services, and when they do,they usually terminate the relationship prematurely. Since cross-cultural relationships exist whenthe helper and the helped do not share the same cultural background, values, norms, lifestyles,roles, and methods of communicating, there are key traits a culturally skilled helper mustdevelop; counselors who receive cross-cultural training have clients who are less likely toterminate early (Parrott, 1997). According to Sue and Sue (1999), culturally skilled helpers areaware and sensitive to their own cultural heritage, and they value and respect differences. They are also aware of their own preconceived notions and biases, and prejudicial attitudes, feelings, and beliefs. They avoid stereotyping and labeling. Culturally skilled helpers are comfortable withdifferences that exist between themselves and their client, and they are comfortable referringclients to someone who may be better qualified to help. According to Sanders (2003), a culturally competent probation officer should exhibit sincerity, high service energy, knowledge of the client's culture, a nonjudgmental attitude, andresourcefulness. Strauss (2002) defines ethno-cultural competency as the ability of the clinicianto function effectively in the context of cultural differences. This includes a basic knowledge ofthe client's ethnic background, a conscious commitment to working with diverse clients, anability to adapt practice skills to fit the client's background, and flexibility in reaching out toappropriate resources within the client's ethnic community resources. Pedersen (2003) argues that providers need to increase their cultural awareness, develop multicultural knowledge, and develop multicultural skills. Developing multicultural awareness isthe first step. Basically, Pedersen contends that providers can increase awareness by takingcourses, participating in discussions, having contact with diverse groups, and by activelyquestioning their own assumptions. Developing awareness is an ongoing process, and developingknowledge occurs when the provider knows the \"salient features of the consumer's culturalcontext and how that context supports or fails to support the provider's strategy\" (Pedersen,2003:34). This is especially important because most providers are members of the dominantculture and most consumers are members of minority cultures. Developing multicultural skills isthe final step in the process of achieving cultural awareness. Pedersen asserts that a skilledprovider is one who can generate a variety of responses to every situation or problem based onmulticultural knowledge and awareness. Providers also need to be aware of very specificinformation regarding various cultural groups. Chung and Bernak (2002) maintain that helpers must develop cultural empathy, which they view as the ability to demonstrate and communicate an understanding of the client's worldview.Basically, a worldview is the ways in which individuals perceive their relationship to the worldas shaped through their culture. It is therefore essential that helpers communicate anunderstanding of the client's worldview. There are six steps that can be taken to demonstratecultural empathy. First, the counselor must understand and accept the context of family andcommunity for clients from different cultural backgrounds. Second, counselors shouldincorporate indigenous healing practices from the client's culture whenever possible. Third,counselors must become knowledgeable about the historical and sociopolitical background ofclients. Fourth, they must become knowledgeable of the psychosocial adjustment that must bemade by clients who have moved from one environment to another. Fifth, they must be sensitiveto the oppression, discrimination, and racism encountered by many people. Finally, counselorsmust facilitate empowerment for those clients who feel underprivileged and devalued. Focusing on how multicultural competence is related to counseling and psychotherapy, Arrendondo (1999) examined the ways in which competencies can serve to confront racism andoppression. These ways are identified as: Knowledge of how a person's culture and heritage affect them personally andprofessionally. Knowledge of how oppression, racism, discrimination, and stereotyping affect thempersonally and professionally. How their negative and positive reactions toward other racial and ethnic groups mayprove detrimental to the counseling relationship. How poverty, racism, and stereotyping may affect the self-esteem and self-concept ofracial and minority clients. Knowledge of how institutional barriers prevent minorities from using mental health services. Knowledge of the bias in assessment procedures. Acting proactively to eliminate biases, prejudices, and discriminatory contents in conducting evaluations and providing interventions. These competencies move from knowledge and awareness of multicultural issues to a moreproactive, social justice approach that has the goal of full and equal participation of all groups ina society. The recent interest in restorative justice has also led to a call for multicultural awareness and skills. Umbreit and Coates (1999) describe the development of restorative justice practicesthroughout the country. Basically, these practices call for a radical change in the way that justiceis served. First, crime violates relationships, and it tears at the social fabric of a community.Second, the proper rule of justice is to repair the damage done and restore relationships.Furthermore, victims must have an opportunity to become involved in the process of justice, andoffenders must have an opportunity to accept their responsibilities and obligations towardsindividual victims and the community as a whole. The local community and its resources shouldbe used to restore both victims and offenders. Finally, the system should utilize the leastrestrictive interventions before resorting to incarceration (Umbreit & Coates, 1999). Approachesthat can be used under this model include mediation, restitution, reparative community boards,and circle sentencing. Umbreit and Coates (1999) note that there are considerable barriers to thisapproach, not the least of which are multicultural issues. These authors stress that it is vital for the criminal justice system to become more sensitive to differing cross-cultural worldviews. Because cultural backgrounds of the victim, offender, andstaff member are likely to differ, there may be miscommunication. Also, there are likely to be asmany differences within cultures as between cultures. For this reason, Umbreit and Coates(1999) recommend attending to such factors as proximity, body movements, paralanguage, anddensity of language. Sue and Sue (1999) conclude that proximity differences abound both between and within cultures. Some cultures favor closer positioning, while others are uncomfortable with face-to-face interactions. Facial expressions may also be interpreted differently. For example, a smilemay not convey the same meaning to every person. Additionally, eye contact is perceived invarying ways. Some cultures believe that maintaining continuous eye contact is disrespectful,while others deem it appropriate. Paralanguage consists of hesitations, inflections, and silence.The Native- American culture, for example, highly values silence, whereas the traditional Anglo-American culture views it as rude and inappropriate. Density of language also differs by culture.Sue and Sue (1999) found that African-Americans, Native-Americans, and Hispanics tend to bemore low-key and indirect in their communication styles, while Anglos tend to be more task-oriented and objective. Furthermore, differences in ideas regarding individualism, religion, andpolitics may impact the practice of restorative justice. Umbreit and Coates (1999) believe that restorative practitioners should follow certain guidelines to foster good multicultural relations. First, practitioners should know themselves by examiningtheir own culture, values, and biases as well as their own communication styles. Practitionersshould also become acquainted with their clients by asking questions and listening carefully.Because cultural influences affect each person differently, Umbreit and Coates suggest that eachclient be understood as a unique individual within the context of culture. Finally, practitionersshould prepare their clients for the experience by explaining the different viewpoints andcommunication styles that they will encounter. Overall, Umbreit and Coates conclude that a justand healing response to crime can be effected through the use of multicultural communicationskills and techniques. Arnoff (1999) developed a manual for cross-cultural communications between Hispanic and Anglo-American populations. The manual contains many compelling ideals, but it should be noted that Hispanics who have assimilated the dominant American culture may not adhere to the behavioral patterns and ideologies outlined. Rather, the behaviors and philosophies Arnoff notestend to be embraced by those who still reside in the country of origin. Still, the information canprovide invaluable insights into the Hispanic culture. She notes that there are many philosophicaldifferences between the two groups, including their understanding of human nature, time,activity, and social relations. For example, Hispanics see themselves as subject to forces in natureas opposed to having dominion over it. She also notes that, as a group, they tend to view humannature as a mixture of good and bad as opposed to being at one end of the spectrum or another.Furthermore, she finds that Hispanics tend to have a different time orientation from Anglo-Americans. That is, they are more oriented to the present than to either the past or the future.They also exhibit a polychromic time orientation, which means that they can attend to severalthings at the same time. For example, Hispanics may interrupt conversations to engage in othertasks or to talk with others. They also tend to exhibit less eye contact when they are speaking tothose whom they perceive as authority figures. There is also a tendency for Hispanics to be lessconscious of time. That is, they may arrive late for appointments. Arnoff (1999) notes that there are traditions in the Hispanic culture that those in the majority culture should be made aware of. Hispanics traditionally focus around the family, and they valuetheir extended family. A high regard is generally placed on friendships, and their relationshipstend to be life-long. In the workplace, they are inclined to be more people- oriented than task-oriented, and they are more personal than businesslike in their interactions. Communicationstyles are often less direct, and they also prefer to make small talk before engaging in business.Finally, Hispanics tend to subordinate the self and self-interest to the good of the family. Arnoff(1999) argues that the dominant culture embraces individualism, or concern for oneself asopposed to concern for the rules and proprieties of the groups to which one belongs. In theHispanic culture, however, the extended group is the major source of identity. An additional concern is the amount of emphasis placed on goal attainment. The majority group generally places a premium on reaching personal goals and assertiveness, which is contrary tothe Hispanic culture (Arnoff, 1999). The majority also embraces an achievement orientation.Hispanics tend to be more ascriptive in their business dealings; in other words, they believe thatpeople should be rewarded for seniority as opposed to achievement. \"Culture context\" is another dimension differentiating groups. Basically, group communications can be categorized as either \"high context\" or \"low context.\" \"High context\" groups look to theenvironment for cues and believe that it is unnecessary to be verbally direct. Most minoritygroups are high context, according to Arnoff (1999). \"Low context\" groups, including Anglo-Americans, transmit most of their information verbally and little is embedded in the context ofcommunication. \"High context\" communicators tend to give implicit messages and rely onnonverbal communication for important cues. \"Low context\" communicators may over-explainthemselves, and \"high context\" communicators may appear underhanded or uncommunicative.These differences may lead to numerous misunderstandings between the groups. Additional difficulties may occur via the use of nonverbal communication. It has been noted that most information is communicated through nonverbal cues (Arnoff, 1999). There are severalcategories of nonverbal communications; one of the most important is personal space. Somecultures, including Hispanic, Arabic, and Southern European cultures, are \"high contact\" culturesthat engage in closer physical communications. That is, they tend to stand closer to one anotherwhen speaking, use more eye contact, touch each other more frequently, and speak more loudlythan \"low contact\" cultures like those of Asia, Northern Europe and the United States (Arnoff,1999). Cross-cultural communications may be misunderstood due to these many differences incommunication styles. In an investigation of the effectiveness of Sociocultural Competency Training (SCCT), Wong (2003) found that training was successful in improving a number of measurable variables.Specifically, SCCT was effective in:improving interpersonal skills; lowering social avoidance tendencies; increasing social self-effectiveness; and increasing the participants' sociocultural competencies in multicultural communities. In the SCCT study, the trainees were immigrant and native-born health science trainees. Finally, Kim & Lyons (2003) developed a game-focused instructional strategy for achieving multicultural competence. They indicate that this training approach can be effective indeveloping improved awareness of beliefs and attitudes, knowledge, and skills. The advantage ofa game format is that it can be used to: reduce feelings of vulnerability; increase safety in exploring bias, prejudices, and limitations; decrease reluctance to risk making mistakes; increase camaraderie in trainees; and increase exploration of difficult and provocative issues. The game format is also particularly attractive due to the scarcity of training strategies designedto instill and enhance multicultural competencies. Assessing Multicultural Competencies One of the traditional difficulties in multicultural awareness training is the availability of a technique or method of assessing knowledge, awareness, or skills in this complex area ofprofessional development. Assessment can involve serious threats when instruments aredeveloped for use in multicultural settings. Geisinger (2003) indicates that these threats includeequivalence and bias. In relation to equivalence, the questions that are asked are: Are theconstructs being measured conceptually equal in the cultures being assessed? Do the behaviorsbeing sampled have the same purpose and meaning in both cultures? In relation to bias,Geisinger cautions against using an assessment instrument in a new culture when it had beenpreviously standardized in an original group. In addition, there can be bias in how theassessment is administered, in the sample, in the items, and in the instrument. Multiculturalassessment requires that cultural and racial concepts be carefully defined and incorporated intoassessment procedures and instruments. Nevertheless, several useful instruments have beendeveloped. Graham and Miller (1995) developed the Cross-Cultural Interactive PreferenceProfile that measures an individual's preference for level of context (high or low) as well as his or her ability to interact effectively across contexts. The profile is intended for use withindividuals who are involved in cross-cultural activities so that they can become more aware ofand sensitive to contextual orientations that affect interactive behavior in culturally diversegroups. The authors of the instrument report acceptable reliability and validity statistics tosupport the psychometric properties of the instrument. Tulin (1995) developed the Diversity Awareness Assessment, which is a tool to get people 1) thinking about diversity, 2) challenging implicit assumptions and biases, and 3) considering other points of view from the perspective of other cultures. The results of the assessment are intendedto evoke discussion among respondents rather than measure competencies. The tool is not a test,so, except for face validity, no other psychometric properties are provided by the author. On theother hand, the instrument could be used as a stimulus for discussion in multicultural training inprobation. In order to assess multicultural awareness, Ponterotto (1997) developed the Multicultural Counseling Knowledge and Awareness Scale (MCKAS). The scale includes 20 knowledge and 12 awareness items that comprise multicultural awareness. Research has determined that the twofactors are internally consistent, with coefficient alphas for the Knowledge scale in the 0.92range and 0.78 in the Awareness scale range. Thus, it appears that the instrument is capable ofdiscriminating between knowledge and awareness.Wang, Davidson, Yakushko, Savoy, Tan, and Bleier (2003) present three studies on the initial validity and reliability of the Scale of Ethnocultural Empathy (SEE), a self-report instrument that measures empathy toward people of different racial and ethnic backgrounds. Empathy is the ability to understand another's perspective even though it varies from one's own. Specifically, theexploratory factor analysis yields four factors: Empathic Feeling and Expression, EmpathicPerspective Taking, Acceptance of Cultural Differences, and Empathic Awareness. Aconfirmatory factor analysis provides evidence for the stability and generalizability of this four-factor solution. The SEE is correlated in the predicted directions with general empathy andattitudes toward people's similarities and differences. Women were found to exhibit higher levelsof empathy than males, and non-White participants exhibit higher levels of general and specificethnocultural empathy than their White counterparts. High internal consistency and test-retestreliability estimates were also found across the three studies. Neville, Lilly, Duran, Lee, and Browne (2000) developed the Color Blind Racial Attitudes Scale (CoBRAS) to assess the cognitive aspects of color blind racial attitudes. A person who exhibits a color blind racial attitude believes that race should not and does not matter. Some argue that it isnot possible to be color blind. This scale measures perceptions of racial privilege, institutionaldiscrimination, and blatant racial issues. Higher levels of color blind attitudes are associated withhigher levels of racial prejudice. The authors suspect that those who hold color blind attitudesmay hold an inaccurate or distorted view of racial and ethnic minorities and race relations(Neville et al., 2000). There is also a relationship between color blind attitudes and genderprejudice. Those holding these attitudes are also more likely to embrace the just worldhypothesis, which is the belief that people get what they deserve. They also tend to embrace thephilosophy that people are rewarded on the basis of merit alone and that one's circumstanceshave nothing to do with social structures (Neville et al., 2000). The findings also suggest thatfemales are more sensitive to social injustice than males. The authors found that CoBRAS scoresare sensitive to multicultural intervention. That is, those who receive training exhibit a change intheir self-reported scores. Finally, Kocarek, Talbot, Batka, & Anderson (2001) studied the reliability and validity of three measures of multicultural competency. They studied the Multicultural Counseling Awareness Scale (MCAS), the Multicultural Awareness-Knowledge-and-Skills Survey (MAKSS), and the Survey of Graduate Students' Experience with Diversity (GSEDS). They determined that, with a few exceptions, all three of the instruments were stable, acceptable tools for measuringmulticultural competency. Overall, there are only a limited number of valid and reliable instruments that can be used to assess multicultural competence. The need for this type of assessment is becoming more obviousand, over time, more instruments will most assuredly be developed. Multicultural Competencies in Probation Two trends in multicultural competencies are quite clear. First, this topic has received a great deal of empirical and theoretical attention in the counseling profession (Pope-Davis, Toporek,Ortega-Villalobos, abuse treatment (Straussner, 2001; Springer, McNeece, &Arnold, 2003). Second, the topic has received very little attention in the general area of criminaljustice, and the specific area of probation. Villarreal and Walker (2002) have provided a call toaction on behalf of Latino and Latina youth in the U.S. justice system for communities, parents,law enforcement, and the justice system. They suggest, for example, that risk and needsassessments need to be valid, racially and ethnically unbiased procedures. Furthermore, theysuggest that law enforcement, mental health, justice system, and educational professionals beadequately trained in cultural competence regarding specific Latino ethnic group. Cintron and Lee (2002) studied the need for bilingual probation officers in the future workforce. In a survey of chief probation officers, they found that most community corrections departmentswere not keeping up with national trends, and the ratio of bilingual professionals lags behind thatof non-bilingual professionals. They also suggest that bilingual probation officers provideservices (court order interpretation, understanding the conditions of probation, compliance with court requirements, getting on time to appointments) that might enhance the probationers' chances of a successful probation. They did not directly study multicultural competencies, but thenational demographic trend and survey responses would seem to support a sense of urgency inmulticultural competencies. Finally, Tarver, Walker, and Wallace (2002) have identified the primary components of \"cultural competence.\" Their presentation is in the context of victim services, but the components wouldseem to apply to several areas of criminal justice, including probation. The first step in \"culturalcompetence\" is awareness of the predominant philosophical schemes of the other person'sculture. These schemes include views of life and death, of conflict resolution, and of individualvs. family control. The second step is to maintain true respect for the other person's culture,accepting it as valid in its own right and equal in status to the customs of the dominant culture. The third step is to maintain an awareness of one's own limitations. Cultural competence means that the probation officer should be open to human differences and enthusiastic about thesedifferences. Fourth, according to Tarver, Walker, and Wallace, cultural competence is client-centered learning, which means the officer admits what he or she does not know to the probationer. Theofficer should also request cultural information and seek out the probationer's view of the crime,probation process, or the court process. Again, even though the writers do not speak directly tomulticultural competencies in probation, they do provide extensive guidelines for probationofficers to prepare for effective cultural contact. Issues and Challenges These professional trends present some interesting issues and challenges for the probation profession, especially in light of recent discussions about reinventing probation and communityprobation (Petersilia, 2002; Reinventing Probation Council, 2002) and recent demographicchanges in the southwestern United States. These issues and challenges can be approached by aseries of questions about the role of multicultural competencies in probation. The philosophicalissues are: What should be the appropriate social justice role for a probation officer working in acriminal justice setting? For example, to what degree should a probation officer besocially active in reducing bias, discrimination, or stereotyping when a probationer isinvolved? Is knowledge and awareness sufficient to be culturally competent or should theofficer be proactive in eliminating barriers for cultural and ethnic groups? How much transfer is there from the counseling profession to the work of a probationofficer in the area of multicultural competencies? Supervision is a major part of aprobation officer's role and a therapeutic relationship is very different from the role of theprobation officer. Except for recent \"hate crime\" legislation, the criminal law has been traditionally andtheoretically color and culture blind. Should the role of a probation officer tend to followthis tradition? Several challenges related to multiculturalism that could be met by specific research efforts are: What is the relationship between multicultural competencies in probation officers andprobation outcomes? Are offenders more likely to complete their probation successfullywhen they are supervised by culturally competent officers? Do different ethnic andcultural populations have unique needs that must be addressed for probation to besuccessful? What is the current level of multicultural competence in probation officers? It might be anerroneous assumption to assume they are either competent or incompetent. How would we assess the level of competency and what would be the standard? What would be the critical curriculum areas required for training probation officers in multicultural competencies? Several sets of curriculum modules have been developed forpolice officers around the country. What are the similarities and differences in acurriculum for probation officers? Are there additional multicultural competencies neededby probation officers? What is the relationship between multicultural competency and the various strategies ofprobation departments? Should officers who lean more toward casework and developmentof community resources be more culturally competent than officers who adopt a lawenforcement and strict supervision role or vice versa? Should officers be matched to offenders based on culture, race, or ethnicity? The results ofresearch on a similar question in the counseling field are inconclusive at this time. How do probation officers administer racially and ethnically unbiased risk and needsassessments, assuming these instruments exist? How does a department conductassessments if unbiased assessments are unavailable? Does multicultural training have a significant effect on the quality of probation services? Can multicultural training and education be developed for probation officers based onreliable and valid assessments? The nature of the probation officer's role is the subject of much discussion and debate. Issuesand questions about an additional variable in the role have been accelerated by concerns withinthe probation profession, demographic changes in society, and collateral changes in relatedprofessions. How should probation respond to these changes? Not many answers have beenforthcoming in the literature of probation. It would seem that the conclusion reached from thiscondition is that the probation profession needs more research, discussion, direction, leadership,and awareness of the need for multicultural competencies if the profession is going to meet thechallenges of a changing society. back to top References The articles and reviews that appear in Federal Probation express the points of view of the persons who wrote them and not necessarily the points of view of the agencies and organizations with which these persons are affiliated.

Yet only approximately 20 percent ofthose within 6 months of release report having received treatment (Mumola, 1999). Drugoffenders, many of whom may be drug users, account for an increasing percentage of thosereleased from prison. In 1980, 11 percent of all releasees were drug-involved. In 1990, theyaccounted for 26 percent of releasees and this percentage increased to 32 percent in 1998 (Lynch& Sabol, 2001; Travis, Solomon, & Waul, 2001). Among those who have evaluated the effectiveness of prison-based drug treatment programs, considerable discussion has arisen about the need to provide aftercare services and ensurecontinuity of care. The effects of in-prison treatment might not be maintained without continuityof care after release (Field, 1998; Hiller, Knight, & Simpson, 1999; Knight, & Peters, 1999). The recent focus upon reentry (Travis et al., 2001) drawsattention to the issue of treatment after release from prison by suggesting that treatment contactbe initiated before releasing an individual from prison. But more generally, the emphasis onreentry issues calls for collaboration between various criminal justice agencies (Burke, 2001). Because some prison systems operate within a context where post-prison responsibilities fall to an agency other than the agency responsible for an individual during incarceration, the issuessurrounding continuity of care are often times unknown. The federal criminal justice system issuch an example. In the federal criminal justice system, unlike some state, county and localjurisdictions, the incarcerating agency (Bureau of Prisons (BOP)) is not only in a differentagency from the supervision provider (Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC)), but itis also in an entirely different branch of government. The BOP is in the executive branchwhereas AOUSC is in the judicial branch. The federal criminal justice system has been increasing its focus on the reentry process inresponse to influences from both within and outside the federal criminal justice system. Those internal influences include the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AOUSC), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Bureau of Prisons (BOP), while the external influencesinclude Congress and the criminal justice literature that has focused on the value of a truereentry approach. Overcoming the cultural, procedural and systematic differences to develop aneffective reentry infrastructure and process will require tremendous commitment and creativityfrom staff in both agencies. back to top Purpose of Study A long-standing memorandum of understanding (MOU) initiated between AOUSC and BOP in 1992 concerns the handling of substance abuse treatment cases and more specifically thetransition of those cases from the BOP to the AOUSC. That MOU recognized the importance ofthe reentry phase to the success of the substance treatment provided by both agencies long beforethat recognition was in vogue in the criminal justice literature. Essentially, the purpose of thisstudy is to provide a measure of impact of that MOU on post-release substance abuse treatment. Drug treatment services and continuity of care are examined among a cohort of approximately 25,000 individuals released in 1999 from the BOP to supervision by a U.S. probation officer. Thetracking of treatment received during and after incarceration was facilitated by an interagencyagreement allowing for data sharing between these two federal agencies. Information on drugtreatment services includes prison-based residential treatment, outpatient drug treatment duringhalfway house placements and drug treatment provided while under post-release supervision.Models are developed to predict drug aftercare and the analyses include an assessment of theextent to which aftercare is prioritized for those who completed residential drug treatment whileincarcerated. Recommendations for interagency information sharing and service planning will bediscussed. back to top Treatment Services The BOP's residential drug treatment program (RDAP) provides 500 hours of treatment over a 9- month time frame. The RDAP participants must meet established admission criteria, whichinclude a documented substance abuse problem and a willingness to partake fully in treatmentservices. Individuals admitted to RDAP must usually be within 36 months of release. Theprogram uses a cognitive-behavioral treatment model and treatment is generally provided for ahalf-day, five days per week. The program attempts to identify, confront, and alter the attitudesand thinking patterns that led to criminal behaviors and drug use. Transitional services (TS) is the other major component of the BOP's drug treatment program. This focuses on providing outpatient treatment during a halfway house placement, for those whoreceive such a placement. Both those who participated in the residential prison-based treatmentand those who did not can make use of Transitional Services. Thus, prior participation in RDAPis not a requirement for receiving TS treatment. Once received by the AOUSC for supervised release or parole supervision, offenders can be required by judicial order to participate in the substance abuse treatment program (SATP). TheAOUSC SATP involves many components, including assessment, outpatient treatment, inpatienttreatment, detoxification, methadone maintenance, and a variety of methodologies to detectsubstance use. Within the components of the SATP, which is primarily an abstinence program,the actual treatment provided, whether inpatient or outpatient, employs a wide range ofmodalities from cognitive to behavior modification to self help and others. back to top Research QuestionsFor purposes of assessing continuity of care upon release to supervision by a probation officer, we selected those who received at least one of the two primary methods of substance abusetreatment provided to inmates in the BOP: Residential Drug Abuse Program (RDAP) andTransitional Services (TS). An assessment of continuity of care first requires information on who receives treatment during incarceration and an understanding of the numbers who participated in one or both of the BOPprograms and who completed or failed to complete the program. Individuals may have receivedtreatment during their incarceration in prison but not during a halfway house placement (somebecause they did not receive a halfway house placement). On the other hand, individuals mayfirst begin receiving treatment during their halfway house placement. Therefore, the firstquestion to be examined is: What percent of those among a release cohort from BOP custodyreceived RDAP and/or TS services? The first level of assessment of continuity of care is to identify the percentage of those receiving treatment during BOP custody who also received treatment post-release. A primary interest is indetermining whether, for example, treatment completers are more likely to receive treatmentunder supervision. However, other questions of interest include identifying subgroups that aremore or less likely to receive post-release treatment. For example, are women more or less likelythan men to receive post-release treatment? What evidence is there for selecting individuals forpost-release treatment based on their background characteristics? Anecdotal information suggests that the philosophies of judges concerning drug treatment can vary considerably. Therefore, another question of great interest is whether there are district orcircuit differences in the provision of aftercare services. back to top Data One particularly vexing problem has been obtaining information on continuity of care from the onset of substance abuse treatment an offender receives in the BOP to the substance abusetreatment that offender receives once released to the supervision of a United States probationofficer. The BOP maintains an operational database, known as Sentry, where substance abusetreatment records are stored. Likewise the AOUSC maintains an operational case managementdatabase where substance abuse treatment records are stored, known as the National TreatmentDatabase (NTD). To study the continuity of substance abuse treatment care in the federalcriminal justice system required the merging of data from those systems. While this is arelatively simple and straightforward concept, the reality proved to be more complicated. Those complications were ultimately overcome and we were able to take Sentry records for 27,420 individuals released from BOP custody in 1999 and match most of them to NTDsupervised release/parole supervision records of the AOUSC. The data was successfully mergedfor 26,813 cases for a matching rate of 98 percent which was deemed satisfactory for purposesof this research. The majority of cases were matched by FBI number (89.6 percent). Theremaining cases were matched by Register Number (6.8 percent), social security number (3.0percent), date of birth, last name (1st 4 letters) and first name (1st 3 letters) (0.6 percent). Sexand race could not be used for matching purposes because of known differences in coding. Next we identified background characteristics for which we wanted to assess whether there was an association with higher or lower levels of post-release treatment. The factors obtained fromthe BOP's Sentry data base included: gender, race, ethnicity, age at time of release, type of drugtreatment received, and items indicating whether the sentence was served only in a halfwayhouse and whether the RDAP and/or TS services were received in a previous incarceration. Twocriminal history indicators were obtained from the AOUSC database: history of felony and riskprediction index (RPI) score. The RPI is a risk prediction index that uses information about anoffender, including prior criminal record, to estimate the likelihood that the offender willrecidivate during his or her term of supervision. Since we were also interested in assessing district differences, we obtained information on the caseload size for each district from the AOUSC database. The federal judicial system iscomprised of 94 federal districts with 93 operational probation offices. Probation cases from the94th district, Northern Mariana Islands, are handled by the probation office within the District ofGuam. Those 94 districts are grouped into 12 regional judicial circuits. Anecdotal informationover the years has suggested that substance abuse cases can be handled differently both fromcircuit to circuit and from district to district. We tested those assumptions with this dataset. back to top Methods Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was used to analyze the data (Golstein, 1995; Raudenbush, Bryk, Cheong, & Congdon, 2000). This statistical technique allows simultaneous modeling ofindividual level effects (e.g., gender, race, risk score) as well as group level effects (e.g., districtand circuit). This statistical technique allows us to answer the question of whether there aredistrict and circuit differences in the provision of treatment after controlling for individualbackground characteristics. In addition to the individual characteristics identified in the datasection, we also classified individuals into eight categories of in-prison/halfway house treatmentand used these categories as predictors in our analytic models. These categories represent thevarious combinations of treatment failure or completion for either or both RDAP and TS (seeTable 1 below for a listing of the categories). back to top Results We begin by identifying those among the 26,813 individuals released to supervision in 1999 who received RDAP or TS treatment while under BOP custody. Approximately 20 percent (n=5320)of those released to supervision received either in-prison residential drug treatment (RDAP) ortransitional services (TS) during a halfway house placement. All of the analyses we report arelimited to these 5320 individuals. Table 1 provides information by completion status on the numbers of those receiving one or both of these services. More than half of those who receiveddrug treatment completed both the in-prison and the halfway house treatment components.Another 14 percent completed RDAP but either they did not receive transitional services (5.9percent) or they did receive TS but did not successfully complete it (8.4 percent). We note thatmany of those who completed RDAP but did not receive TS did not receive a halfway houseplacement and thus could not receive TS. The majority of those who failed RDAP also did notreceive TS. While 10.2 percent of those receiving treatment were RDAP failures who did notreceive TS, only 1 percent were RDAP failures who received such services. Finally, more than18 percent of those receiving one or both types of services received services only during theirhalfway house placement (e.g., TS). We note that an additional 1 percent of the release cohort(n=294) received RDAP and/or TS in a previous incarceration. Many of these individuals wererevoked and served an insufficient amount of time to be readmitted to RDAP. Having developed the profile of the 5,320 offenders treated by the BOP, we now turn to the reentry aspect of continuity of care for those offenders as they are released from BOP to AOUSCsupervision. Table 2 provides information on treatment services received while under supervision for all those individuals who received treatment under BOP custody. Information is provided foreach of the BOP treatment categories contained in Table 1 . Because treatment can be initiated at any point during supervision, we defined continuity of careas treatment assigned by a probation officer within 90 days after admission to supervision. Thisninety-day period was selected for a variety of reasons. First, we felt that the continuum of carewould be broken beyond ninety days. Second, the majority of individuals who suddenly begintreatment more than ninety days after release from prison were likely to do so in response tosubstance use or other violation behavior, which seemed to place them beyond the purposes of this project. In addition, detoxification services were also likely to be in response to substance abuse, and so were also excluded, even if initiated less than 90 days after admission to supervision. Overall, 37.6 percent of those who received treatment under BOP custody also received treatment within 90 days after admission to supervision. An additional 15 percent of theseindividuals received detoxification services or inpatient/outpatient services which started morethan 90 days after admission to supervision. Table 2 shows that for six of the eight BOP treatment types, the percentage who received treatment during supervision ranged between 39 and 43 percent. The two categories that stood out showed lower percentages receiving treatment while under supervision: 33.6 percent amongthose who failed RDAP and did not receive TS and 16.1 percent among those who completedRDAP and did not receive TS. It appears that both groups who did not receive TS had lowerrates of continuity of care from BOP to AOUSC. We next assessed the role of individual characteristics, including background factors and type of BOP treatment received, as well as the role of group level characteristics (district and circuit)using HML multivariate analyses. Table 3 summarizes the findings by indicating whether a predictor was significant and if so, whether the relationship was positive or negative. Predictorsthat were positive are those associated with a greater probability of receiving treatment duringsupervised release and predictors that were negative are those associated with a lower probabilityof receiving such treatment. The offender's race showed no significant impact as a predictor of receiving post-release treatment. Prior felony and risk prediction index (RPI) scores were shown to have a positivepredictive value, which demonstrates that controlling for other factors, offenders are more likelyto receive treatment post-release when they have prior felonies or present a greater risk to thecommunity. Age at release had a negative impact on the likelihood of treatment post-release, afinding consistent with anticipated or desired outcomes for the SATP. Two demographic factors did have somewhat unanticipated predictive power: gender and ethnicity. All other factors being equal, female offenders are more likely to received post-releasesubstance abuse treatment. This is an interesting although somewhat unexpected finding whichmay require further study and explanation. The one somewhat surprising finding among thedemographic characteristics is ethnicity. Hispanic ethnicity, controlling for race, has a negativeimpact on the likelihood of post-release treatment. This would appear to be an area requiringfurther study and analysis to determine causal factors so that if appropriate these factors can beaddressed. Only one category of BOP treatment received was associated with a lower likelihood of SATP treatment than on average: RDAP Complete - No TS. In contrast, those who completed RDAPand received TS, whether or not they completed TS, were more likely to receive SATPtreatment. In addition, those who received TS only and completed were more likely to receiveSATP treatment. These results indicate the need to identify why those individuals, albeit a smallpercentage of those receiving BOP treatment, who received in-prison treatment only, have asignificantly lower likelihood of receiving post-release treatment. The last set of results indicates that our only predictor related to district characteristics, caseload size, was not significant. However, it is important to note that HLM results are valuable in thatthey provide information on unexplained variation. After controlling for the individualcharacteristics, the HLM results indicate that there is variation left to explain at both the districtand circuit level. This implies that individuals with similar characteristics are more likely toreceive treatment in some districts or circuits but less likely to receive treatment in other districtsor circuits. back to topDiscussion The goal of this research was to assess continuity of care across two independent substance abuse treatment programs, each with its own goals and purposes, and identify potential policy changesthat would enhance the combined impact of these programs on the offenders they serve. Thisapproach represents a major philosophical shift from the past operation of these two programs.However, the agencies have a long-recognized understanding of their interrelationship,particularly in the area of substance abuse treatment, which should sustain them on the longjourney ahead. That journey requires that all staff, from senior managers to frontline officers andcase managers, recognize that our ultimate success is contingent on a systemic approach to theproblems posed by substance abusing offenders. Our research indicates that changing certainpolicies would likely improve the federal \"system\" of substance abuse treatment for offenders.Future research will be required to examine the impact of these policies. It should be noted that while the research did identify issues that should be addressed, the majority of factors were confirmed in the direction that policy makers and practitioners wouldwant. Specifically, race was shown to have no impact on whether or not someone receivessubstance abuse treatment. Prior felony convictions and RPI score (both predictors of theoffender's risk to the community) were shown to have a positive relationship with the likelihoodof treatment. Age at time of release showed a negative impact. All of these outcomes bode wellfor the AOUSC SATP and support that it is a strong program which consistently directs itsresources toward the offenders of most concern in a public safety program. However, like anygood program it can be improved and the following steps by both agencies would enhance theprogram. The AOUSC needs to identify a policy that could decrease variation across districts and circuits in the provision of drug treatment to those who received treatment during incarceration by theBOP. The models employed in this research showed significant variation by district and circuiteven after controlling for caseload size and related variables. To insure a consistent nationalsubstance abuse program for offenders, regardless of their district or circuit of release, thetreatment they receive must have less unexplainable variation. The identification and implementation by the BOP of policies to increase the likelihood that RDAP offenders receive TS treatment would have several advantages. This would not onlymaintain the continuity of care but would also increase the likelihood that, once released,offenders would receive treatment during supervision. back to top References The articles and reviews that appear in Federal Probation express the points of view of the persons who wrote them and not necessarily the points of view of the agencies and organizations with which these persons are affiliated.

Ibarra, Kent State University Norman A. Lurie, Science Applications International Corporation Introduction Domestic Violence and the Use of Protective Orders Methodology Results Conclusion THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE system has been using electronic monitoring (EM) for about twenty years (Conway, 2003), typically as a form of house arrest, as an alternative sanction or inthe context of pretrial release. Offense categories for which EM is used tend to be at the \"lessserious\" end of the offense continuum, including drunken driving, drug and property offenses,and less commonly for offenses against the person (Scott and Hale, 2002:2). In a time ofoverburdened budgets and facilities, EM is intended to control offenders at a cost that is lowerthan institutional confinement, while enabling them to continue working and supporting theirfamilies. EM based on continuously signaling devices (Crowe et al., 2002) involves equipping an offender with a transmitter and a receiver that are synchronized to a monitoring center, which periodicallyregisters his presence at or absence from home; and sends curfew violations trigger alerts tosupervising officers, who then may investigate the basis for the alerts. We refer to such anapproach as unilateral EM (UEM) because an offender alone is the object of ongoing supervision. Most evaluation studies of EM have been of the unilateral form, typically addressingthe technology as a means of surveilling offenders and enforcing restrictions in the absence oftraditional detention or incarceration (for reviews see Black and Smith, 2003; Crowe et al., 2002;and Vollum and Hale, 2002). Evaluation studies of UEM have focused on such topics as itseffectiveness in reducing recidivism, its cost effectiveness relative to incarceration, and legalconcerns associated with its application in different criminal justice phases. There has been little systematic research 1 on the electronic monitoring of persons2 charged with or convicted of domestic violence (DV) related offenses, where the technology is used not only for surveillance/control but also for victim protection. We refer to the latter use of EM asbilateral, because a second party is enrolled into a program of surveillance. 3 In the context of DV offenses, bilateral EM (BEM) extends the mandate of unilateral EM by protecting specificindividuals (\"victims\"), 4 as opposed to being designed to address public safety interests ingeneral, or to prevent absconding while out on bail. Courts attach or impose this measure with the expectation that BEM will strengthen protection orders. The victim's participation and cooperation are necessary to the functioning of BEM programs for DV cases, introducing avariable absent from UEM. Treatment or rehabilitative issues are of inexplicit relevance to thesemostly pretrial uses of BEM (Vollum and Hale, 2002). This article addresses the gap in research on the use of EM for DV cases by examining two such programs. We begin by discussing the limitations of protection orders in DV cases thathistorically have warranted the use of BEM. We then report on two BEM programs, describingkey aspects of their design and implementation. Results reported include the types and frequencyof contact violations between victims and defendants who participated in the programs, andvictims' reactions to and concerns about BEM. back to top Domestic Violence and the Use of Protective Orders Studies have found that victims of domestic violence typically report it only when they have reached the \"enough is enough\" tipping point (Fischer and Rose, 1995), after they may havebeen repeatedly subjected to various forms of abuse, ranging from intimidation to harassment,stalking, and physical assault (e.g., Stanko, 1990). However, taking action against domesticviolence by reporting it to the police or attempting separation can place women at a higher riskof assault. \"Separation assault\" (Mahoney, 1991) is a well-known phenomenon in the dynamicsof domestic violence, as are instances of stalking estranged partners in places where they areroutinely present (e.g., workplace) or likely to visit (supermarket, church, etc.). According to arecently published study (Block, 2003), three-fourths of homicide victims and 85 percent ofwomen who experienced severe but nonfatal violence had left or tried to leave their batterers inthe past year. Despite the danger faced by women when they want to leave abusive relationships or appeal for help to the justice system, protecting them (as well as their children and other family members)has been a difficult task. The context and dynamics of domestic violence render the legalprotection of its victims a continuous challenge to the justice system, one fraught with logisticalproblems and contradictions (Worden, 2000). Courts have responded to the problem of securingthe safety of women who have stepped forward as victims of abuse by issuing protection orders,often as an adjunct to an official proceeding brought by the state in response to the victim'scomplaint. These protection orders typically require that the named offending party refrain fromcontacting the victim and other family members, and/or move out of the house. Research on theeffectiveness of protective orders indicates that they are generally associated with a decrease insubsequent physical and non-physical violence by batterers (e.g., Holt et al., 2002; Holt et al.,2003). However, several studies have found that such orders may not be as effective in keepingwomen safe when the defendant has a history of violent offenses (Buzawa and Buzawa, 1996;Erez and Belknap, 1998a; Fischer and Rose, 1995). The use of protective orders in the context of DV carries benefits for some victims but can be complicated to execute (Harrell, 1993; Buzawa and Buzawa, 1996;Wolf et al., 2000). Someoffenders do not comply with the various terms of the protective orders (e.g., Erez and Belknap,1998b; Worden, 2000). Moreover, some batterers, upon receiving the protective orders, are soangered that they seek out their victims for renewed assault (Erez and Belknap, 1998a). Anotherissue to consider is that many abused women, particularly those who have not reached thetipping point, may want to have (non-violent) contact with the offender in spite of the presenceof a protective order. They are still emotionally or economically attached to the batterer, andoften have children together. At times, therefore, they allow their abuser to contact them, seekhim out at his place, or arrange a rendezvous. The police have been known at times to argue thatthey no longer had the responsibility for enforcing protective orders when the victim initiated acontact with the offending party named on a protective order and violence re-erupted between the once again estranged couple (Buzawa and Buzawa, 1996; Erez and Belknap, 1998a).The intimate nature of these relationships means that the offender will be well versed in the victim's routines, and personal and social affiliations, such as family, friends, and membership in organizations. He knows when and where she works, the school where she waits to pick up thechildren, her telephone numbers, as well as her travel routes to reach home, work, or fulfill otherresponsibilities, needs or preferences. Such knowledge of her routines furnishes the abuser withnumerous opportunities to harass, stalk, intimidate, assault or abuse the victim in violation ofprotective orders. An especially significant contact violation from the court's perspective involvesoffenders who seek out the complaining witness with requests that she retract the complaint.Victims are often frustrated when they report such protective order violations, however, becausethe issue can come down to a \"he said, she said\" situation in the absence of proof that thedefendant made the contact alleged in their complaint or affidavit. BEM is designed to address these various limitations associated with protective orders in DV cases. The major premise of BEM is that defendants under \"no contact\" orders, who know thatthey cannot approach a certain geographical area without detection, will be less likely to attemptto contact a victim, despite a history of violating such orders in the absence of BEM. Courtofficials argue that although some defendants will not be deterred in such circumstances, manyothers will conform to protective orders if they know they are monitored electronically whenthey approach the victim or her residence. One judge in our study stated: I think (the program) drives the message home to the offender that there is to beno contact, that the no-contact order is going to be supervised and that there arerepercussions if there is any contact. Likewise, I think it gives the victim someadded sense of security. It puts some teeth into an oral order: 'stay away and haveno contact'. You can tell somebody that, but if you actually have a device orsystem in place that's really going to measure it and make sure that there isn'tcontact, that helps across the board. It enhances a temporary protection order; itputs some teeth into it. The results of our research generally support this view, indicating that defendants in a program ofBEM by and large refrain from attempting to contact the victim, while participating victimsgenerally feel an increased sense of safety during their involvement with the program. back to top Methodology Data were collected at two sites using the following methods: First, official records kept by the probation departments administering the programs5 were used to document such information as defendants' demographic characteristics, offense history, EM status and details (e.g., how longunder supervision), protection order violations and offenses during and after BEM enrollment.Second, in-depth interviews were conducted with victims (30); defendants and convictedoffenders (27); criminal justice personnel (34), including police, prosecutors, judges, probationofficers; and victim assistance professionals (8) based both inside and outside the justice system.Interviews were either with focus groups or individuals. Third, field observations were made (atone site) of how the equipment was installed at participants' residences, how the program wasexplained to defendants and victims, how supervisory personnel visited with defendants at theoffice and in the field, and how the court handled cases involving BEM during different courtphases. The following results are drawn from the data collected through these methods. back to top Results Technology, program design and implementation The BEM programs we studied are in two Midwestern states: one is run by the River County (a large metropolitan urban area) Probation Department; the other is administered by the Lakefront (a small city in a mostly rural county) Probation Department.6 Defendants are ordered to remain at a particular distance from the victim's residence, which may be anywhere from 1,000 feet to one mile. Both sites utilize radio frequency (RF) based technologies that operate on similar principles and require similar equipment, with some exceptions.7 RF based EM programs for DV generally work as follows: the defendant is equipped with atamper-resistant, ankle-worn transmitter. A receiver in the defendant's residence confirms hispresence during court-ordered curfew hours. A receiver in the victim's home will detect thepresence of a defendant when he enters a defined geographical radius of up to 500 feet. Radiuspenetration of a victim's home region results in an immediate call to law enforcement. Receiversare ordinarily monitored 24/7 by a commercial monitoring company via normal phone lines. Inaddition, the victim may be given a pager to receive messages from the monitoring center, aduress pendant, and/or a cellular phone pre-programmed to notify authorities. The victim mayalso carry a field-monitoring device to alert her to the approach of the defendant while she isaway from her home receiver. The defendant is not tracked while away from home, as is thecase with GPSbased systems. It is important to note that the equipment does not provide physical protection of the victim. It will simply provide a warning (and notification to the police) whenthe defendant is nearby, as long as the ankle transmitter is worn. Thus the equipment will notprevent someone who is determined to hurt a \"protected\" party and is not concerned about theconsequences to himself. 8 We observed that personnel emphasize this technological limitation to victims during the installation. Most participants are referred at the pretrial stage and remain on the program until their cases are disposed (90 percent or more of the offender caseloads9 at both sites is comprised of defendants). The rationale cited by River County court personnel and program staff for using EMmostly for pretrial cases was that the pretrial phase was \"the most volatile period\" in domesticviolence cases, because some batterers are prone to further abuse, manipulate, or intimidate theprosecuting witness. The victim's consent is required in order to proceed with the installation of the equipment in her home; withdrawal of the victim's ongoing consent at any point during the program's tenure willresult in the removal of her equipment, at which point the defendant might be transferred to aUEM program for the duration of the case, as deemed appropriate by a judge. EM installationrequires that the victim (and defendant) give up certain telephone features, such as call-waiting,call forwarding, and telephone-based internet access; unwillingness to surrender access to suchfeatures is a reason victims at both sites gave for not wanting to participate in the program. 10 River County defendants are not expected to pay for the cost of the program, the rationale beingthat as defendants, they have not been found guilty of any charges. Lakefront's defendants haveto pay for the cost of the program regardless of their status in the case. Neither program requiresvictims to pay program costs. Most referrals to both programs originated in lower level rather than higher level courts, where the offenses handled are more serious and bond requirements are more onerous. River Countyoften offered BEM to defendants in lieu of posting a cash bond, or discounted bond amountswhere defendants agreed to participate in BEM; Lakefront made participation in BEM acondition of release from jail on bond. The programs also differed in terms of who initiated therequest for BEM. River County's referrals were heavily victim initiated, as a representative of avictim support organization was present at arraignment and would advise all DV victims present about the BEM option. Prosecutors and judges usually initiated Lakefront's referrals; a court-based victim advocate 11 or prosecutor ordinarily advised the victims of the program only after she indicated intense fear of the defendant. Different definitions about who is a suitable candidate for EM were observed at the two sites. River County considered as appropriate for their program defendants in every relationship phase;thus, candidates were drawn from couples who hoped to reunite at some later date, couples whowere in the midst of separating, as well as parties who had formally separated and who had nodesire to reconcile. By contrast, Lakefront candidates deemed suitable for enrollment were drawnstrictly from cases in which victims were judged to have no further relations with the accused, asevidenced by some form of permanent separation such as divorce, a new boyfriend or husband, or if one of the parties had moved out. In other words, because the woman was unequivocally estranged from the defendant, the problems of \"back pedaling\" by victims, or of witness tampering by defendants, were less likely to occur, and less likely to be cited as rationales for theexistence of Lakefront's program. A cost that is borne by some River County defendants isfinding a new residence in which to live, as they cannot inhabit the same premises as theprotected victim. This is generally not an issue in Lakefront, given that the couple had usuallyalready separated. Due to these different definitions of who was suitable for BEM, the mostcommon charge faced by River County defendants was domestic violence, while in Lakefront itwas stalking or invasion of privacy. The two sites require participants' agreement to varying liberty restrictions and levels of supervision. For instance, River County requires defendants to make weekly office visits duringwhich urine screens are administered, and submit to surprise home visits (at an average of twoper month). Lakefront does not have such rules and policies in place, deeming them too intrusiveor burdensome for non-convicted persons. Similarly, River County more strictly limits \"outhours\" to work and travel time, and requires advance notice of up to one week for deviationsfrom agreed upon schedules. Lakefront is more flexible in setting curfews and has a \"hands off\"attitude toward defendants' whereabouts while not working provided that they return home before11 pm. River County's greater emphasis on supervision grew out of a proactive concern with\"trigger control\"\u2014a focus on monitoring defendants for risk factors associated with domesticviolence (e.g., use of alcohol, substance abuse, weapons in the house) in relationships that havenot permanently ended. River County's more proactive approach to supervision is also probablyrelated to the higher proportion of their caseload that is high degree felony (36 percent versus 3percent in Lakefront). Program resources were much more plentiful in River County than inLakefront, also enabling a higher degree of supervision over enrolled cases. 12 As a result of the different definitions of suitable candidates for referrals, and of the differentprocesses through which BEM requests were initiated, the River County site had far moreeligibility assessments for BEM. Over a three-year period, River County referred 1,711 cases, 32percent of which were \"hooked up\" to BEM. By contrast, Lakefront's program referred 71persons for eligibility assessments over the nine years of its existence, with a 55 percent hook uprate. The differential partially reflects the fact that BEM was not a condition of release on bondin River County but rather an inducement to a lower cash or \"Own Recognizance\" bond. River County defendants/offenders averaged 48 days on BEM, with a median of 32 days; Lakefront defendants/offenders spent an average of 72 days on BEM. 13 The shorter mean time that River County participants spent on BEM may be in part a reflection of the tightersupervision to which they are subject and the more extensive rules by which they have to abide;in other words, they are likelier to be \"violated out\" of the program. Violations of the Victim's Home RadiusThe main purpose of BEM is to keep defendants away from victims' homes, and there were very few instances in which the victim's home radius was penetrated, as reported by the monitoringcenters. River County's logs reported eleven \"radius penetrations\" committed by seven personsover a twoyear period, most of which were classified by staff as \"informational violations.\"These were essentially \"drive-by penetrations\"; the defendants were curious about whether thewoman had a male guest at her home, or the defendant was testing the sensitivity of themonitoring equipment. These violations were often observed to have been committed while thedefendant was intoxicated. Only one of the eleven cases could be classified as overtly hostile. Inthis case, a \"jealous husband\" was upset that his wife had a boyfriend at her apartment, forwhich the husband was still paying rent. After cutting off his anklet without being detected, heshowed up at the apartment, broke down the locked door, and threatened to do lethal harm toboth the woman and himself. The victim alerted authorities to her partner's presence through theuse of her duress pendant, and police in turn responded rapidly. At Lakefront, over a nine-yearperiod there were no \"intentional\" violations of the victim's home radius. \"Incidental\"penetrations were not considered intentional violations unless they formed part of a pattern, andthe staff discerned no such patterns.Other Contacts and Contact Violations Certain kinds of contacts are not registered by the monitoring centers. For example, encounters at court, telephone calls, contacts by proxy, chance meetings on the street, sent flowers and mail, etc. Although victims were known to make complaints about these contacts to the program staff,it is not known whether victims who participate in BEM programs report them at a higher ratethan non-participating victims. However, it seems likely that victims with BEM programs who doreport such contacts will find a more receptive ear, considering that they have already establishedrelationships with program staff, whose duties include offering them support services. Face-to-face contact violations were the most common type of non-home-based violations reported by River County victims. There were few serious face-to-face violations reported byvictims or program staff. One incident, at Lakefront, involved a \"deranged\" defendant (chargedwith stalking) showing up at the work place of an unrequited former high school crush. Mostface-to-face violations were the result of chance meetings in public places, during which thedefendant might make a provocative comment to the victim. A common way in whichdefendants communicated face to face, albeit at a distance, was in the courtroom or in the court'shallway. Such communications were usually non-verbal gestures, and in some cases they weredone right under the noses of unaware judges. Defendants also spoke about having been contacted and sometimes harassed by the victims, typically by telephone, and some mentioned that the women drove by their homes repeatedly, asif to taunt them. Some women admitted driving by the defendants' homes, claiming that theywanted assurance that he was where he was supposed to be; others admitted to driving past hishome to check whether their field-monitoring devices were operational. Some defendantsclaimed that the victims made conjugal visits to their homes, which the victims denied.However, in two instances a probation officer, during a surprise home visit, found a protectedvictim hiding in a defendant's shower, which led to the arrest of the defendant for violating theno contact order. Finally, some victims stated that they initiated telephone calls to the defendant,but only for some practical reason, such as to make arrangements for a child to be picked up ordropped off. According to these women, an intermediary, such as a friend, family member orprogram support staff usually placed the call on their behalf. Victims' Experiences, Concerns and Complaints Overall, victims reported being pleased with their BEM experience and the time free of contact from the defendant it offered, allowing them to reassess their relationship and past actions. They claimed that BEM afforded them an opportunity to reassert a sense of control over their lives andre-imagine and plan their futures. The women also spoke about how their fears were alleviatedand their sense of safety was enhanced, giving them and their children peace of mind and restfulsleep for the first time in memory. One woman stated: It was really good for my daughter. She was there when all this happened to me.She was in the same boat for almost three hours, (held) by a cross bow and aninemillimeter. She witnessed everything. It made her feel better knowing that if hecomes around us he'll get caught. Before I had (BEM) she would be scared that hewould slip through the bars or break out of jail, but with the box at home she's finenow. She can sleep. Thus, many of the women's experiences with the program led to a reappraisal of the justicesystem. One woman stated, \"while the system sometimes lets us women down, at least we havea little bit of comfort knowing we have a box that will go off if he comes into the area where hedoesn't belong.\" Some victims \"tested\" the equipment by pushing the \"help buttons\" on their basereceivers in order to gauge the rapidity of police response. They reported quicker responses thanthey received following prior incidents when they had called 9-1-1; this added to their comfort.The test also bolstered their confidence in the system's capacity to protect them. Victims at both sites expressed concerns and had complaints, however. Some felt that thetechnology could create a false sense of security, leading them to become \"too relaxed\" about the risks in resuming \"normal\" activities, like washing the car or mowing the lawn alone, without a human sentry at their side. Others worried about whether they might become too reliant on theirduress pendants in their daily life. For example, one woman stated, \"I never walked out my frontdoor without it. If I worked in my yard, I took it with me. If I went to the mail box I took myhand-held unit with me.\" Another woman added, \"I don't even go into the basement without it.\"This theme was reiterated when they spoke about how difficult it was for them (and theirchildren) to have the equipment removed from their homes following adjudication. One womanwas asked how her life changed after the equipment was removed from her house. She replied,\"It's horrible. I'm back to being totally one hundred percent paranoid every time I walk out of thehouse.\" She went on to describe how she resumed her old ways of protecting herself: I went back to leaving all the lights on in the house, sleeping with the lights on,checking the car before I enter it, looking up and down the street when I back out.I haven't mowed the lawn in two weeks or been out in the yard for fear of him. False alarms could also be troublesome, especially at Lakefront, where the monitoring center'spractice was to notify the victims whenever the defendant had not gotten home by curfew, orwhen there was a power failure, with the aim of preparing the victim for a possible breach of her\"geo-zone.\" Although no danger ever came to the women as a result of these curfew violations,Lakefront victims spoke about the disruptiveness of these calls, causing them fear at first, andlater, when they became routine, irritation. Telephone outages, which rendered them withoutelectronic cover, were a concern for the women, as were the occasional equipment malfunctionsthat resulted in loud beeps falsely warning them of a breach of their perimeter. River County'svictims were notified of possible breaches by a pager. Some victims stated that it could bedifficult to remember what the numerical pager code meant, exacerbating the panicked state ofmind brought on by the pager in the first place. Although the women felt that the equipment was often impressive (e.g., the base receiver's microphone was praised for its pinpoint accuracy) and useful (e.g., the field monitoring device'swarning system was appreciated for the protection it provided away from home), they wereworried that the equipment is not \"childproof.\" Children were often attracted by the flashinglights on the base receivers and played with the buttons and triggered false alarms. They alsocomplained that the pieces of equipment were bulky and difficult to carry. The women werebothered by the fact that the monitoring equipment can interfere with phone calls while it\"checks the line.\" The requirement that certain special telephone features be disabled, includingcall-waiting, call-forwarding, and an Internet connection, was the subject of many complaints.Women who had a second telephone line, however, did not encounter any of these problems. The women offered some suggestions for improving the program. They would have appreciated a guide or handbook that detailed how the equipment worked, important instructions to follow,the program rules that defendants must observe, and the legal procedures that pertained to theircases. They stated that it was often difficult to keep all of these things clear. The women alsostated that a support group made up of other \"women who have been through this\" would be veryhelpful. They often felt that they were alone in going through this experience, and they enjoyedthe opportunity to discuss the issues in the context of a focus group. Many of them exchangedphone numbers at the end of these interviews, with promises to stay in touch and offer assistanceto one another. back to top Conclusion The program in which EM is anchored shapes its application, and the two BEM sites we studied adopted varying approaches to designing programs for enforcing protective orders in domesticviolence cases. These differences included their identification of suitable candidates, the extentof liberty restrictions to which defendants were expected to comply, the approach taken tobearing the costs of the program, and the use of BEM as a choice or as a prerequisite to releasefrom jail. More broadly, the program in River County is one that is more responsive to research about the \"cycle of violence\" in intimate relationships, that identifies \"triggers\" associated with violence and considers how increasing victim safety may bolster criminal justice prosecutorialgoals. By contrast, the program in Lakefront, which intervenes with BEM only after therelationships are over (or never existed in the first place), takes its mission primarily as one ofenforcing a court's order that a defendant remain clear of a named party. These different conceptions of the purpose of BEM, coupled with the variable programs in which the technology was anchored, raise questions about applying uniform criteria to assess theeffectiveness of BEM technology across programs or jurisdictions (cf. Tonry, 1999). Despitethese differences, however, it was apparent that victims perceived the programs as usefulenhancements to their safety. Jurisdictions interested in addressing victim safety might thereforegive serious consideration to adopting such programs in appropriate cases. back to top References | Endnotes The articles and reviews that appear in Federal Probation express the points of view of the persons who wrote them and not necessarily the points of view of the agencies and organizations with which these persons are affiliated.

References | Endnotes R. Barry Ruback Pennsylvania State University OTHER THAN TRAFFIC offenses, economic sanctions have been used relatively infrequently in the United States, in large part because of the country's heavy reliance on incarceration.Moreover, financial penalties are considered to have no effect on wealthy defendants, for whomthe amounts are assumed to be inconsequential, and to be unfair to poor defendants, for whomthe additional monetary burdens are assumed to be overwhelming. Despite these arguments for not using economic sanctions, there are three reasons why they are being imposed more frequently than in the past. First, the costs of criminal justice operations arebecoming so high that offenders are now expected to pay at least part of those costs. Second,concern for victims has increased and will continue to increase, causing restitution to be awardedmore frequently. Third, there are pressures for alternatives to prison because of the high cost ofincarceration, the limited number of spaces available in some prison systems, and the belief ofsome people that long periods of incarceration are unjustifiable on grounds of just deserts andare ineffective in deterring future crime. Purpose, Imposition, and Payment of Economic Sanctions This study uses data from Philadelphia during the period 1994-2000 to examine the imposition of three types of economic sanctions: fines, costs, and restitution. Although research typicallyfocuses on only one of these economic sanctions, in actual cases they are usually not used inisolation. That is, sentencing often involves multiple economic sanctions used in conjunction withprobation and sometimes incarceration. Fines. Fines are monetary penalties paid by the offender to the state. Fines have several advantages over other types of penalties (Hillsman,1990). They are obviously punitive. They can be tailored to the seriousness of the particular crime and to the specific individual's criminalhistory and resources. They are also flexible, since they can serve as sole penalties or can be combined with other sanctions, ranging from treatment to incarceration. Moreover, they allow theoffender to remain in the community, work, and avoid the stigma and social costs of incarceration (Gordon & Glaser, 1991). Within a jurisdiction, judges usually apply the \"going rate\" for fines, such that all violators of a particular offense are obligated to pay similar amounts (Hillsman & Greene, 1992). Becausejudges tend to use this going rate for fines, however, they do not adjust the seriousness of thepenalty to the particular defendant (Hillsman & Greene, 1992). And, since this going rate isusually low (in order to accommodate the poorest offenders), fines have little penalty value foraffluent offenders. Typically, judges' adjustments to fines are at the back end, rather than at theinitial sentencing. That is, judges might sometimes excuse the remaining unpaid portion orsimply let the probation period expire without enforcing the fine (Hillsman & Greene 1992). Costs. Costs refer to money paid by the offender to the state to partially cover the expenses of prosecution, confinement, and community supervision. In some cases, these funds also support expenditures such as victim/witness assistance and victim compensation. Generally, the amountof costs imposed is a standard rate for each count. Thus, the only question in these courts iswhether to impose costs, not how much. Olson and Ramker (2001) found that judges in rural areas were significantly more likely than judges in urban areas to impose probation fees, probably because rural judges are likely to bemore responsive than urban judges to their communities and more concerned with the impositionof justice in individual cases than with the processing of large numbers of cases (see alsoWeisheit, Wells, & Falcone, 1995). These researchers also found that higher amounts ofprobation fees were paid in rural areas, probably because judges in rural areas were concernedthat offenders pay something, whereas judges in urban areas were concerned that fees should beimposed and enforced only if they were set at a level high enough to justify the time andexpense of collection. Restitution. Restitution refers to a convicted offender's court-ordered obligation to compensate victims for their losses resulting from the crime. Most often, restitution involves an offender making monthly payments to cover the costs of damaged or stolen property, although thesemonies may also be ordered to cover medical expenses and lost wages (Harland, 1981).Restitution is widely supported because it both addresses victims' needs for compensation andmeets the criminal justice system goals of punishment and rehabilitation. Today, every state hasa law addressing restitution, and 29 states mandate restitution unless the judge gives compellingreasons for not doing so (Office for Victims of Crime, 1998, p. 356), consistent with the callmade by the President's Task Force on Victims of Crime (1982). In one study of restitution, Outlaw and Ruback (1999) examined adult probation cases from Allegheny County (Pittsburgh), Pennsylvania in which restitution was or could have been acondition of probation. Results indicated that judges ordered restitution most often when damageswere easy to quantify and that offenders were most likely to pay the restitution when they wereable to pay and when the victim was a business. Restitution payment was negatively related torearrest, and this effect was especially strong among married persons, who were more integratedinto the community. This finding is consistent with an experimental study in which juvenilesrandomly assigned to formal restitution programs had lower recidivism than juveniles randomlyassigned to other dispositions (Ervin & Schneider, 1990). Restitution programs have generally not been seen as successful because 1) there is a reluctance to impose restitution on offenders who are assumed not to be able to pay it, 2) payment onrestitution orders typically follows other financial obligations (e.g., costs, fines), and 3) there isoften ambiguity about who is responsible for monitoring, collecting, disbursing, and enforcingrestitution payments (Office for Victims of Crime, 1998, p. 358). Thus, it is not surprising thatcollection rates of restitution are low, ranging in two national studies from 45 percent (Smith,Davis, & Hillenbrand, 1989) to 54 percent (Cohen, 1995). Multiple economic sanctions. Opposite predictions could be made about the relationship among these three different types of economic sanctions. On the one hand, one could hypothesize thatthey would all be positively related, in that judges might believe that if offenders can pay one, they can pay them all. On the other hand, one could hypothesize that they would all be negatively related; that is, an increase in one type of economic sanction would result in loweramounts of other types of economic sanctions. Such a pattern would be evidence that judgesrecognize offenders' limited financial resources and consider offenders' ability to pay in settingthe amounts of economic sanctions. A study of probation fees in Illinois found support for both hypotheses. Olson and Ramker (2001) found that probationers ordered to pay both fines and probation fees had lower averagemonthly fees than did probationers ordered to pay only fees. However, Olson and Ramker foundthat there was no trade-off between fees and other penalties when those other conditions werenon-economic (e.g., treatment, community service). They also found that probation fees weremore likely to be imposed and more likely to be paid if fines were also imposed, a pattern thatsuggests the imposition of some economic sanctions is positively related to ability to pay. A study in Pennsylvania also suggests that there is no clear pattern to the imposition of economic sanctions. In this study of four medium-sized urban counties (Ruback, Shaffer, & Logue, 2004),the imposition of fines was negatively related to the imposition of restitution. The imposition ofcosts was positively related to the imposition of fines but unrelated to the imposition ofrestitution. When these sanctions were imposed, the amounts of fines, costs, and restitution werepositively related. In their analysis of economic sanctions in misdemeanor cases in Los Angeles, Gordon and Glaser (1991) found that the amount of financial penalties imposed (restitution, fines, cost of probationsupervision) was affected by the type of crime (assaults, burglaries, drug crimes, DUI, or theft).Compared to drug offenders, offenders convicted of burglary, DUI, and theft receivedsignificantly higher financial penalties, a result that suggests judges did not believe financialpenalties were appropriate for drug offenders. Finally, they found that the predictors of thedifferent types of economic sanctions were the same, a result that suggests judges treatedrestitution, fines, and costs similarly. The present research was designed to examine the relationship among costs, fines, and restitution in Philadelphia, the fifth most populous city in the United States and a city with one of thecountry's highest violent crime rates (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2003, Table 6, p. 39). Thisresearch is an improvement over prior studies in that it had a large sample of both misdemeanorand felony cases and that it examined cases over a seven-year period. Statutory Changes in Pennsylvania Aside from looking at the relationship among three types of economic sanctions, we were also interested in looking at the effect of the 1995 statutory change making restitution mandatory. In1995 Pennsylvania made mandatory the paying of restitution to victims whose property wasstolen or damaged or who suffered personal injury as a direct result of a crime (18 Pa. C.S.A.\u00a41106). Moreover, judges were to impose full restitution regardless of the offender's financialresources. Consistent with results in four medium-sized urban counties in the state, we expectedan increase in the imposition of restitution after the statutory change and either no effect or adecrease in the imposition of fines and costs. In 1998, Pennsylvania enacted a second statutorychange regarding restitution. Under this law, 50 percent of all payments by an offender had to bedirected to restitution for victims. We expected this change to result in slightly higher rates ofimposition of restitution, as judges would be more likely to believe that ordered restitution wouldreach victims. Method Data for the years 1994-2000 were taken from computer files maintained by Philadelphia. Cases were sampled on the basis of crimes that were considered to be \"restitution eligible,\" that is, cases with an identifiable victim (an individual, a business, or a state agency). This classificationexcludes DUI and drug offenses. Also excluded are cases determined to have no identifiable victim, based on crimes listed in Title 18 (Crimes and Offenses) of Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes Annotated. Description of the Sample For each case there were 20 items of information. The first, the variable on which cases were selected for inclusion in the study, was the major charge. Under this selection procedure, there were 108 crimes for the years 1994 through 2000. Of the 84,970 cases in the data set, 84,185(99 percent) were accounted for by 33 crimes with at least 50 cases. 1 The remaining 75 types of crime accounted for 778 cases, and 13 cases were missing this information. Across crimetypes, three dummy variables were created to capture the nature of these crimes: a) attempted vs.completed, b) conspiracy vs. no conspiracy, and c) violent vs. property. The data contained information about whether or not there was a private criminal complaint, whether the court was a municipal court (which handles misdemeanors) or Court of CommonPleas (which is a court of general jurisdiction), the date of arrest, the type of attorney (coded aspublic defender or court-appointed attorney versus a private attorney), the date of sentencing, theamount of fines imposed, the amount of restitution imposed, whether costs were imposed,whether probation was imposed, the starting date of probation, the expiration date of probation,the actual termination date of probation if it were different from the expiration date, the genderof the offender, the race/ethnicity of the offender, the method of case termination, the reason acase would still be open after the expiration date, the date of rearrest (if any), and the number ofdays between the date of sentencing and rearrest. There were a total of 84,970 cases in the data set, broken down by year as follows: 12,146 in in 2000. Of these cases, 54,812 were felony cases processed in Common Pleas Court and30,151 were misdemeanor cases processed in Municipal Court (7 cases did not have informationabout which court was involved). Table 1 presents a description of the cases in the data set, by type of victim (private individual/business vs state) and overall. As can be seen there, most of the offenders were black. The remaining offenders were white (21 percent), latino (5 percent), other (2 percent), or missing(1 percent). Most offenders committed property crimes, and most did not have a private attorney. The 5,415 cases in which the state was the victim were analyzed separately because they differed substantially from cases in which the victim was a private individual or business. Most important,there were gender differences. Women committed 14 percent of the crimes where the state wasnot the victim, but 83 percent of the crimes in which the state was the victim. Blacks committed71 percent of the crimes in which private individuals or businesses were the victim, but 83percent of the crimes in which the state was the victim. The analyses were limited to thoseindividuals who were 16 years or older. ResultsThree types of economic sanctions were investigated: restitution, fines, and costs. The results are presented in two parts, relating first to the imposition of each sanction overall, and specifically byyear. Second, there is a multivariate analysis of the imposition of each type of sanction. Change Over TimeOne of the issues we were interested in was whether the imposition and payment of restitution changed over time, and, if so, what factors might be related to this change. Although there wasan increase over time in the proportion of cases in which restitution was imposed in cases inwhich private individuals/ businesses were the victims, there was a decrease in the proportion ofcases in which costs and fines were imposed (see Table 2 ). Although there was a significant increase in the average amount of restitution ordered, there has not been a comparable increase inthe average fine ordered. A pre/post test of the impact of the 1995 mandatory statute indicated a significant increase in the percentage of cases in which restitution was ordered, from 16 percent (for the year 1994) to 22 percent (for the years 1996-2000), X2 (1, 72760) = 239.95, p < .001 (Yates' correction). A pre/post test of the impact of the 1998 statute indicated a small but significant increase in the percentage of cases in which restitution was ordered, from 21 percent (for the years 1996 and 1997) to 24 percent (for the years 1999-2000), X2 (1, 47910) = 72.09, p < 0.001 (Yates' correction). Individual and Business Victim CasesCases in which individuals and businesses were the victims were analyzed in terms of the imposition of economic sanctions, the payment of economic sanctions, and the effect ofeconomic sanctions on recidivism. Imposition of economic sanctions. Table 3 presents the results of logistic regression analyses of the imposition of restitution, fines, and costs in those cases in which the private individuals and businesses were the victims. Restitution was significantly more likely to be ordered for youngerindividuals, for whites, for individuals who had private attorneys, for cases in Common Pleascourt, for cases after the 1995 statute was imposed, for probation cases, and for cases in whichcosts were imposed, and were significantly less likely to be imposed for cases in which fineswere imposed. Fines were significantly more likely to be imposed for males, for olderindividuals, for whites, for offenders with private attorneys, in Municipal Court, when costs werealso imposed and were significantly less likely to be imposed when restitution was imposed.Costs were significantly more likely to be imposed for older offenders, for black offenders, forcases after the 1995 statute, for offenders who had private attorneys, in Municipal Court, whenfines were also imposed, and when restitution was also imposed. Overall, then, costs werepositively related to both restitution and fines; restitution and fines were negatively related. Thispattern suggests, consistent with Olsen and Ramker's finding, that judges make tradeoffs whenimposing restitution and fines, requiring offenders to pay one or the other. However, if judgesimpose either restitution or fines, they are also likely to impose costs. State Victim Cases The 5,415 cases in which the state was the victim were analyzed separately from the other casesbecause they differed in substantial ways from cases in which private individuals or businesseswere the victims. Ten different property crimes were included in this category (e.g., taxviolations, medicaid fraud, food stamp fraud), but public assistance violations accounted for5,295 (98 percent) of the cases. As noted earlier, offenders in this category of state victim crimeswere primarily female and black. Restitution was imposed in 4,494 cases (83 percent). The rangeof restitution orders was from $15 to more than $100,000 (M = $4,382; Mdn = $3,000; Mode =$2,500). Fines were imposed in only 53 cases (1 percent). The range of fines was from $50 tomore than $100,000 (M = $6,406; Mdn = $750; Mode = $500). Costs were imposed in 1,880cases (35 percent). Table 4 presents the results of logistic regression analyses of the imposition of restitution, fines, and costs in those cases in which the state was the victim. Restitution was significantly more likely to be ordered for welfare cases, for individuals who had private attorneys, and for casesafter the 1995 statute was imposed and was significantly less likely for male offenders, for casesin which fines were imposed, and for cases in which costs were imposed. Fines weresignificantly more likely to be imposed when costs were also imposed and were significantly lesslikely to be imposed when the offender was black, for welfare cases, in Common Pleas Court,and when restitution was imposed. Costs were significantly more likely to be imposed for maleoffenders, for offenders who had private attorneys, in Common Pleas Court, and when fineswere also imposed, and were significantly less likely after the mandatory statute and for welfarefraud cases. Overall, then, fines and costs were positively related; restitution was negativelyrelated to both fines and costs. Discussion This study examined three types of economic sanctions\u2014costs, fines, and restitution\u2014for bothmisdemeanors and felonies and for both private individual/business victims and the State as victim. Summary of the FindingsOverall we found that restitution was more likely to be imposed for property crime whereas fines and costs were more likely to be imposed for nonproperty crimes (most of which were violent).One of the clear findings from this study was that the 1995 statute making restitution mandatoryhad an effect: both restitution imposition rates and restitution amounts ordered were higher afterthe statute than before. 2 Contrary to our expectation, restitution was awarded to the State at a higher rate than to private victims, and this difference was even more pronounced after thestatutory change making restitution mandatory. The increase in imposition rates for crimes against private individuals and businesses after the statute was probably not greater for three reasons. First, despite the mandatory nature of thestatute, it may be that in practice restitution is ordered only if the victims request it. It is likelythat victims are not aware that they must make this request. Second, most of the offenders areprobably poor and the odds are low that they would be able to make payments. Third, theamounts of money involved are relatively small, and judges, prosecutors, and probation officersmay not believe that the money that could be recovered is worth their involvement. In contrast to private victims, offenders of most crimes in which the State is the victim were ordered to pay restitution, and the increase after the statutory change was even more dramatic.This effect of greater benefit to the State than to private individuals and businesses probablyrepresents an unintended consequence, in which the State was simply better able to meet thelegal and practical requirements of receiving restitution. Specifically, with the State, there was nopossibility of victim precipitation or victim responsibility, the state agencies involved asked forrestitution, the exact amounts of loss were known and easily quantified (see Outlaw and Ruback1999), the offenders in the non-welfare fraud cases probably did have money (since they wererelatively more likely to have private attorneys) and therefore there was a greater probability ofpayment, and the average amounts of money involved were relatively large. This study also found no simple relationship among the three different types of economic sanctions examined here. On the one hand, judges appeared to make tradeoffs between restitutionand fines for both individual/business victims and the State as victim. Thus, when the statuterequired higher rates of restitution, judges appeared to balance that increase with a decrease inthe imposition of fines. On the other hand, however, the relationship between fines and costs waspositive for both individual/business victims and the State as victim. That is, if judges imposedfines, they were also likely to impose costs. Taken together, these patterns suggest that judges might be looking at offenders' ability to pay these sanctions. When the choice lies between restitution to victims and fines paid to thegovernment, judges follow the mandatory law and impose restitution. However, when paymentsare due to the State and County governments through fines and fees, judges impose both or donot impose either. This explanation is consistent with results from an anonymous statewide survey concerning the imposition of restitution, which was sent to all criminal court judges in the State in September2001. Of the 147 judges responding, 17 identified their county as Philadelphia. Typical of thesejudges' views of restitution was the statement of one: \"Except in fraud and theft/burglary cases,we rarely see requests for restitution. Most of our offenders are too poor to pay anythingsubstantial.\" Another judge wrote, \"You can't get blood out of a stone. When you have rapes,aggravated assaults, gun-point robberies of those with no skills who have never held a job, whatgood is restitution? They will be in jail for five to ten years and have no assets. It's theexception, not the rule, in the major cases in a large city.\" More quantitative responses were also consistent with the view that most offenders in Philadelphia could not afford to pay restitution. A set of t -tests comparing the responses of these 317 judges from Philadelphia to the remaining judges indicated several significant differences. Compared to the judges in the rest of the state, Philadelphia judges were more likely to take type of offense into account, more likely to lower fines in order to reduce the total economicsanctions, less likely to say they impose restitution for violent victims, more likely to saycollecting restitution is a problem, more likely to impose indirect criminal contempt charges forfailing to pay, more likely to believe that too much time elapses before payment is made, morelikely to believe that there is inadequate contact with offenders, more likely to believe thatinadequate priority is given to warrants, and more likely to believe that offenders think nothingserious will happen to them. These responses suggest that judges in large cities impose economic sanctions differently than do judges in suburban and rural areas. Future research should examine how tradeoffs in economicsanctions are made in different types of counties for different types of crime, and whether thetradeoffs between economic sanctions and incarceration differ in urban and rural counties. back to top References | Endnotes The articles and reviews that appear in Federal Probation express the points of view of the persons who wrote them and not necessarily the points of view of the agencies and organizations with which these persons are affiliated.

Blakely, University of South Alabama Vic W. Bumphus, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga Introduction Privatization: A History Ideological Orientation Methodology Findings Discussion Conclusion WITH THE ADVENT of get-tough sanctions, the demand for prison space is great. As state and federal facilities are forced to operate at or above capacity, solutions are increasingly beingsought from the private sector. One solution that has gained increased popularity is theprivatization of the prison. A private prison is a facility that incarcerates offenders for profit.Recent figures from the Bureau of Justice Statistics indicate that about 7% (94,948) of America'sstate and federal prisoners are incarcerated in privately operated prisons (Bureau of JusticeStatistics, 2002). By all accounts, this trend is expected to continue. For example, the U.S.Bureau of Prisons has announced its intention to increase the number of federal prisoners housedin private facilities to an anticipated 20,000 within the next few years (Camp et al., 2002: 28).This suggests that correctional privatization will continue to gain momentum (GAO, 1996: 3;Welch, 2000: 82). The increased momentum of prison privatization makes it vital to determine if the private sector ascribes to similar or different ideologies than those that have traditionally driven publicoperations. This determination is valuable since the objectives of the contemporary prison areincreasingly ambiguous (Garland, 1990: 3). The lack of a clearly defined ideology is resulting ina growing sense of doubt and dissatisfaction with modern penal practice. Thus, our nation'sprisons and correctional departments adhering to a variety of ideologies that make the systemappear more philosophically disjointed than in the past. This confusion not only exists at theinstitutional level but is also prevalent among prison employees. Garland notes that prisonemployees have historically been able to justify various practices by placing them withinestablished ideological frameworks. However, those now employed in the prison are left withlittle direction or even a widely accepted justification for their efforts. By considering prisonprivatization, insight can be obtained about the role of the contemporary prison (both private andpublic) as well as the role that a profit ideology may play in the future application ofpunishment. back to topPrivatization: A History Prison privatization is historically grounded (Cohen, 1985: 63; Lichtenstein, 2001: 189). Similar practices were common in parts of Europe during the seventeenth century, having their birth inAmsterdam and Hamburg (Spierenburg, 1998: 66). Simon observes that in Europe, it waspossible to \"obtain public authority to confine troublesome people\" in private facilities (1993:22). The operators of these facilities sought profit and self-sufficiency by charging fees foradmittance and discharge, food and water, and even lodging (Austin & Coventry, 2001: 9;Lichtenstein, 2001: 193). Sellin, too, notes that early prisons sought \"financial profitability\"(1958: 11). Cohen traces the roots of contemporary privatization to the 1960's when there arose a social desire to \"divest[ing] the state of certain control functions\" (1985: 31). This movement is alsobeing fueled by a growing dissatisfaction with government and its inability to fulfill itscorrectional responsibilities (Austin & Coventry, 2001: 9; Cohen, 1985: 35; Jacobs, 2001: 184;Lichtenstein, 2001: 191). The recent trend to privatize prisons began in earnest in 1984 whenHamilton County, Tennessee and Bay County, Florida entered into contracts with the privatesector. Currently, 158 private correctional facilities operate in 31 states (Thomas, 2000). The shift from a publicly operated correctional system to one that contains a corporate component has led to concerns about an inherent conflict between public and private interests(Christie, 2000: 149; Logan, 1990). This concern hinges upon the belief that profit will be ofgreater importance to the private sector than the constitutional, ethical, or fair treatment of itsinmates and staff. Some scholars have even suggested that the pursuit of profit may be donethrough substantial cuts in staffing, training, and ancillary services (Brister, 1996; Logan, 1996;Thomas, 1996;). Since labor accounts for approximately 70% of all prison expenses, \"the secretto low-cost operations is to have \"the minimum number of officers watching the maximumnumber of inmates\" (Austin & Coventry, 2001: xi & 16; Welch, 2000: 82). Thus, conventionalwisdom suggests that the private sector will operate at or above capacity and employproportionately fewer staff than does the public sector. Furthermore, the movement to privatize prisons is reflective of a larger socio-economic and political movement occurring worldwide. Referred to as \"neo-liberalism,\" corporations involvedin this movement embrace a capitalistic fervor that seeks the abolition of governmentintervention and the expansion of economic free enterprise (Martinez & Garcia, 2000: 1; Passas,2000: 21; Starr, 1988: 8). This desire to expand into new avenues of profit has lead corporationsto consider prison operations. It is the possibility that these corporations will cut wages andemployee benefits (Martinez & Garcia, 2000; Passas, 2000) that make prison privatization one ofthe most significant issues facing contemporary society (Passas, 2000: 16). back to top Ideological Orientation The ideological orientations of \"normalization\" and \"less eligibility\" have long been used to describe prison operations (Feest, 1999: 100) and were instrumental in providing the ideologicalframework for this study. Prisons operating under a \"normalization\" orientation emphasizetreatment and rehabilitation (Downes, 2001: 66; Simon, 1993). These facilities also value civilrights and offender reformation. In an opposite fashion, under the philosophy of \"less eligibility\"inmates are seen as possessing \"reduced citizenship\" and few rights (Jacobs, 1980: 432; Simon,1993: 265). Little concern may exist for inmate reformation. These characteristics combined witha desire for low-cost operations (Welch, 2000: 74) or even profit may increase the likelihood thatinmate populations and facility staff will be targeted for cost-cutting measures. These ideologies provide a natural continuum upon which the public and private correctional sectors may be situated. By placing normalization and less eligibility at opposite ends of thiscontinuum, analysis of each sector's characteristics can reveal toward which ideology eithersector is located in relation to the other. It was hypothesized that since the private sector operateswith a \"for-profit motive,\" less eligibility would be its dominate operational ideology (see Table 1 for ideological characterizations). Much of the contemporary literature suggesting differences between the sectors are based largely upon speculation rather than observation and research. Some of this literature suggests that thetreatment of inmates held by the private sector will be of a lower standard than that accordedinmates held in public sector prisons. For example, Pha asserts that corporations tend to treatpeople as commodities with financial factors \"overriding\" all other considerations (1996: 20;Peck, 2001: 1; Wright, 2000: 21). This body of literature suggests that privatization will havenegative effects upon staff and inmates, alike (Kicenski, 1998: 11; Lotke, 1996: 3). In anopposite fashion, other scholars have identified ways in which privatization may benefit inmatesand prison employees (Logan, 1990). The lack of research and the myriad of opinions andspeculative statements in the literature suggests that no study has yet determined the ideologydriving private sector operations. back to top Methodology Data were obtained from the Criminal Justice Institute's (CJI) Corrections Yearbook. The 1998 and 2000 editions were initially selected for comparative analysis. However, data on the privatesector were incomplete for 2000. During 1998, approximately 74% of the prisoners held by theprivate sector and 53% of the private prisons were represented in the data set. However, by2000, only 35% of the prisoners held by the private sector and 36% of the private prisons wererepresented. Specific areas of prison operations for 2000 fared even worse. For example, only 12private prisons (down from 53 in 1998) provided information on employee turnover rates. Sincedata for 2000 were incomplete, data were obtained solely from 1998. During both 1998 and2000, 88% of all public sector prisoners were represented in the CJI data-sets. Once selected, data were entered into SPSS to obtain descriptive analyses including frequencies and means. Additional statistical information was obtained directly from the Yearbook. Datawere provided by 6 private corporations, including 47 prisons operated by CorrectionsCorporation of America (representing 59% of the data), 21 prisons operated by Wackenhut(representing 26% of the data), 6 prisons operated by Management and Training Corporation(representing 8% of the data), 4 prisons operated by Avalon (representing 5% of the data), and 1prison each for Capital Corrections and Australian Correctional Management (2% of the datacombined). The hypotheses for this project include an expectation that (when compared to the public sector): the private sector will pay less, provide less training, will have proportionately fewer officers per inmate, and will have lower officer retention and retirement rates, the private sector will suffer from increased levels of violence, the private sector will have a smaller percentage of its inmate population participating indrug treatment, and the private sector will pay inmate laborers proportionately less. For a hypothesis to be considered supported and for its related findings to be used to place thesectors upon the ideological continuum, the difference between the sectors must reflect aminimum difference of 25 percent. If a specific difference between the sectors is less than 25%,it will not be used to place either sector upon the continuum. By using such a high percentage asthe criteria for comparative purposes, the reader is presented with a conservative test of practicaland substantive significance. back to top Findings Demographic, Custody & Sentencing Data When considering the data provided on Table 2 , it is evident that a large percentage of those incarcerated by both sectors are African American. Furthermore, the private sector reports housing a higher percentage of female inmates than does the public sector. Both sectors reportedthat the average age of their inmates at admission was approximately thirty. Likewise, the totalpercentage of inmates 49 years of age or less, for all practical purposes, is also too similar to bedistinguished. When considering custody levels, the private sector houses approximately 21% fewer inmates at the maximum and close security levels and approximately 15% more inmates at the minimumsecurity level than does the public sector. Thus, 90% of the private sector's inmate population isclassified at the medium or minimum levels, whereas only 69% of the public sector's inmatepopulation are so designated. When considering the average number of months served byinmates prior to release, the private sector reported a stay of 11 months versus approximately 28months for the public sector. Thus, the average length of stay for inmates in private sectorprisons was over 16 months less than for inmates incarcerated by the public sector. This isconsistent with differences in classification where higher security designations are often tied tooffence seriousness and sentence length. Finally, the private sector operated at 82% capacitywhile public sector prisons operated on average at 113% capacity. Thus, private prisons wereoperating at 18% below their capacity levels while public prisons were operating at 13% abovetheir designed capacity levels. Salaries, Training Levels, Staffing Ratios and Turnover Rates In 1998, the private sector paid officers $15,919 to $19,103. This range represents a difference of$3,184. During this same year, public prisons paid their officers $21,246 to $34,004. This rangerepresents a difference of $12,758. Thus, the private sector paid new officers approximately$5,327 less than did the public sector while offering less advancement in salary, with thedifference in maximum salaries being $14,901. This finding supports the hypothesis that theprivate sector will pay its correctional officers less than the public sector. This finding alsoindicates that the private sector, with regard to correctional officer salary, is located nearer theless eligibility end of the ideological continuum than is the public sector. The private sector required correctional officers to undergo an average 174 hours of pre-service training and 42 hours of annual in-service training. In comparison, the public sector requiredcorrectional officers to undergo an average 232 hours of annual pre-service training and 42 hoursof in-service training. This suggests that the public sector required 58 additional hours of pre-service training above that provided by the private sector. This finding supports its relatedhypothesis and suggests that the private sector is nearer the less eligibility end of the ideologicalcontinuum than is the public sector. The private sector also reported an average correctional officer turnover rate of 43%. Turnover refers to the total number of officers leaving a particular prison during a specific year. Similarinformation was also available regarding total staff turnover rates and their causes. Figuresindicate that 71% of those individuals leaving private prisons resigned their position, while 0.6%retired, 21% were terminated/dismissed, and 7% transferred to another facility. In comparison,the public sector reported an average correctional officer turnover rate of 15%. This suggests thatthe private sector experienced officer turnover rates approaching three times that of the publicsector. Total staff turnover rates were also available for the public sector, indicating that 63%resigned their position, 15% retired, and 22% left for unknown reasons. Thus, the private sectorhad approximately 9% more of their staff resign and 15% fewer of their staff retire. This findingsupports its related hypothesis and suggests that the private sector is nearer the less eligibilityend of the ideological continuum. When considering staff to inmate ratios, the private sector reports an average 6.7 inmates per correctional officer and 3.7 inmates per staff member. The public sector, in comparison, reported an average 5.6 inmates per correctional officer and 3.1 inmates per staff member. This finding suggests that the private sector had higher inmate to officer and staff ratios than did the publicsector. This finding is not surprising considering private prisons are newer (Pratt & Maahs,1999), may employ advanced security measures, and incarcerate a less serious inmate population.Because the differences between the sectors did not exceed 25%, this particular finding will notbe used to place either sector upon the ideological continuum. Frequency of Assaults (Homicide Excluded)The private sector reported an average of 40 assaults on inmates and 9 assaults on staff per prison. An assault is generally considered to have occurred when an inmate causes anotherperson bodily harm. The public sector reported 19 assaults on inmates and 10 assaults on staffper prison. This suggests that the private sector experienced more than twice the number ofassaults against inmates than did the public sector and slightly fewer assaults against staff. Thefindings pertaining to inmate to officer assaults were almost indistinguishable. However, thedifference between the sectors regarding inmate on inmate violence is interpreted as supportingits related hypothesis, suggesting that the private sector is nearer the less eligibility end of theideological continuum than is the public sector. Drug TreatmentThe private sector reported on average 28% of their inmate population participated in drug treatment programs. Drug treatment includes counseling, group therapy, and specialized drugaddition programs. On the other hand, the public sector reported that 14% of their inmatepopulation participated in similar treatment programs. This suggests that private sector prisonshad, on average, twice the number of inmates participating in drug treatment than did the publicsector. Thus, the related hypothesis was not supported and suggests that the private sector isnearer the normalization end of the ideological continuum than is the public sector. Inmate WagesThe private sector reported that it paid its inmates a wage of $1.09 to $2.75 per day for non- industry labor (6.5 hours per day). The public sector reported that it paid its inmates an averagewage of $0.99 to $3.13 per day for non-industry labor (6.5 hours per day). This suggests that theprivate sector paid $0.10 per day more than did the public sector for their average minimumwage, but approximately $0.38 per day less for its average maximum wage. The differencesbetween the sectors did not exceed 25% and will not be used to place either sector upon theideological continuum. back to top Discussion When considering the distribution of the findings presented here, it is apparent that there are two separate areas of private prison operations being considered\u2014those more easily controlled by aprison's administration in their pursuit of profit, and those that are more likely to be contractuallyobligated and beyond an administration's direct control, thereby making cutbacks more difficult.Knowing that the single largest cost associated with prison operations is staffing, it becomessignificant that this is the area where substantial differences were found. While data could not belocated regarding typical contractual obligations, enough material exists in the literature tosuggest that staffing is usually not an area where specific requirements are specified. Not onlywere major differences found in staff pay and training, but these differences may contribute tothe elevation of the private sector's employee turnover rate. Furthermore, pay, training, andturnover may all contribute to the higher levels of violence seen in the private sector. With regard to the placement of the sectors upon the ideological continuum, three of the four characteristics that situate the private sector closer to the principle of less eligibility are related to its employees. In an opposite fashion, inmate participation in drug treatment suggests that theprivate sector is nearer the normalization end of the ideological continuum. This somewhat debunks the popular belief that the private sector will fail to offer treatment as a way to increase profit and ensure a continued clientele. Furthermore, this finding fits well with the overall natureof the private sector as housing the less hardened offender - the very type that is more willing toparticipate in rehabilitative endeavors. Therefore, higher participation rates may be related moreto the type of inmate housed by the private sector than to a specific ideology to which it mayascribe. Therefore, the overall significance of this finding is somewhat lessened. Furthermore, the private sector incarcerates a greater percentage of females than does the public sector. This runs counter to popular belief that suggests that incarceration of females is moreexpensive and problematic, making their incarceration financially prohibitive. Such a finding isnoteworthy, since it challenges previous speculation suggesting that the incarceration of thefemale would largely be left to the public sector. Again, this finding fits well with the overallnature of the private sector as housing the less serious and less dangerous offender. Informationconcerning specific arrangements between the sectors with regard to male and female per diemfees were unavailable; therefore, little is currently known about differences in the quality of theirincarceration, the types of services provided during their incarceration, or the costs associatedwith their incarceration. Additional research should be conducted with regard to the relationshipexisting between the private sector and the female inmate. The private sector is also much less crowded than previous speculation has suggested. The belief that the private sector operates at or above capacity to maximize profit has not been substantiatedby this study. In fact, the private sector operated, on average, 24% below that of the publicsector. Again, this may be due more to the nature of the private sector as an \"overflowmechanism\" for the public sector than to any specific ideology or operating objective that it mayascribe to. Finally, since the private sector operates below capacity and houses less seriousoffenders it should, by all conventional thinking, also be a safer place to be incarcerated.However, findings suggest otherwise. Precisely why the private sector is a more dangerous placeto be incarcerated remains unexplained. Further research would be useful to support or discreditobservations similar to those made in Kesler et al. v. Brazoria County (1998) where the court suggested that private sector violence may be associated with staffing practices. back to top Conclusion Similar to the public sector, a majority of those incarcerated within the private sector are young minority males. However, the difference between the sectors is marked with regard to thecustody levels at which these individuals are held. In essence, the private sector incarcerates theless serious offender, whereas the public sector retains those of a more serious nature. Likewise,the average number of months served by those incarcerated by the private sector is less than halfthat served by those in public sector prisons. Therefore, the general demographic makeup of eachsector's prisoner population with regard to age and race appear similar but the dangerousness andaverage length of stay differ markedly. This notwithstanding, the private sector is a moredangerous place to be incarcerated. The private sector also appears to have a greater proportionof its inmate population participating in drug treatment than does the public sector. Overall,findings suggest that the private sector adheres more closely to a less eligibility ideology thandoes the public sector. back to top References The articles and reviews that appear in Federal Probation express the points of view of the persons who wrote them and not necessarily the points of view of the agencies and organizations with which these persons are affiliated.

Introduction Project Background Organization of the Research Impressions of Restorative Justice Experiences with Restorative Justice Impediments and Challenges to Restorative Justice Architecture of Responsive Restorative Justice Summary Reflections on Restorative Justice Working Agenda for Restorative Justice A Conclusion, A Beginning FOR AT LEAST the past 25 years, the victim role in criminal justice has been debated in theory and contested in practice. Of particular significance to proponents of restorative justice isChristie's (1977) assertion that conflict is the \"property\" of the victim. Normatively then, victimsshould assume a central role in justice responses to crime and anti-social behavior. Butempirically, have they? Elias (1992; 1993) rather emphatically makes the case that they havenot: the use and abuse of victims, he claims, is the stock and trade of the U.S. justice system. A very different response to the prospect or the reality of a central victim role suggests just asemphatically that they should not . A recent iteration of this view (Ashworth, 2002) argues several familiar \"points of principle\" that would circumscribe or circumvent a victim role,including the limited legitimate interest of victims in compensation and reparation, and the \"risk\"that victim participation and prejudice threatens proportionality (the direct and unfettered link ofthe sentence to the seriousness of the offence) and undermines the independence of tribunals,courts and conferences. More critical considerations range from the impact of research andpolicy initiatives on the status of victims within the criminal justice system (Mawby andWalklake, 1994; Lamb, 1996) to focused consideration of advantages of informal versusconventional justice responses for victims of crime (Strang, 2002). This paper, and the research itdescribes, seeks to address the conjecture about the victim role in restorative justice policy andpractice in the United States. Minimally, it attempts to encumber the debate with evidence, bytaking the elemental step of listening to what victims and their advocates have to say.back to top Project Background This paper details the activities and outcomes of the Listening Project, a collaboration of professionals active in the victim community and the field of restorative justice in the UnitedStates. Funded through the Center on Crime, Communities & Culture of the Open SocietyInstitute, the project was housed in the Institute for Justice and Peacebuilding at EasternMennonite University from 1999-2002, and thereafter in the Office on Crime and Justice of theMennonite Central Committee US. The Listening Project was specifically designed to confront the significant deficiencies of restorative justice practice pertaining to victim participation and impacts for victims, their advocates and victim services generally. A core project objective was to collaboratively proposean action plan to create more responsive restorative justice programs and beneficial outcomes forvictims. A number of strategies for gathering the input of victims and their advocates, and forfacilitating dialogue between victims, victim services and restorative justice personnel wereundertaken, divided into two phases. Phase I of the Listening Project sought to enhance and amplify the voices of victims, victim advocates and victim services. Teams representing victim and restorative justice advocatestraveled to seven states during 1999-2000 (Vermont, Ohio, Washington, Texas, Missouri,Wisconsin and Florida) to listen and record the ideas and concerns of victims, victim serviceworkers, and victim advocates regarding victim needs, the victim experience of justice, andimpressions of restorative justice in general. One hundred twenty individuals were involved inthese listening sessions across the seven states. Where Phase I of the Listening Project emphasized listening and documentation, Phase II was an intense and structured dialogue between representatives of the listening sites, victims, their advocates, victim services personnel, and restorative justice practitioners. Held over two days inearly 2001, this meeting critiqued and amplified preliminary findings of the study, identifyingmajor areas of agreement and concern regarding restorative justice, and creating an agenda forreconsidering and enhancing the victim role and benefits from restorative justice initiatives. back to top Organization of the Research The following pages seek to capture the range of opinions and observations expressed in the listening sessions of project personnel with victims, their advocates, and victim service workersduring Phase I of the study, as well as the deliberations of the Phase II discussions. A number ofdata sources have been incorporated here. Prominent among these are the full transcripts of thelistening events from which a significant amount of direct feedback about restorative justice hasbeen derived. Additionally, meeting facilitators also reflected on what they heard andexperienced, and more than 75 percent of the participants of the listening events completed briefsurveys to assist with the evaluation of the project. Those additional observations have beenincluded. Finally, detailed notes from the general meeting and dialogue of Phase II have in largemeasure shaped the presentation in the final sections of the report. This material both clarifiesand adds to information gathered during the listening sessions, and proposes the contours of anagenda for restorative justice to increase its responsiveness to concerns of the victim community. These data provide a comprehensive and generally consistent appraisal of contemporary restorative justice policy and practices, largely from the perspectives of victims, their advocatesand victim services. 1 It is important to note that the very nature of this exercise\u2014explicitly, to appraise and critique\u2014is prone to result in cautious reflection and emphasis of shortcomings . The reader might therefore leave with a somewhat distorted view, perhaps an overly negativeview, of the impact of restorative justice on the victim community. That consequence is certainlyunintended and largely unsupported by much of the data. No artificial effort was made tobalance this likely outcome, such as attempting to elicit more positive feedback regarding restorative justice. While some participants in this project voiced the need for some type of audit of existing restorative justice programs, and indeed this has been articulated as arecommendation, the project itself was not designed for this purpose. The findings and conclusions of the Listening Project are distributed among seven interrelated sections. Impressions of Restorative Justice reflects on the definition of the concept, its values, priorities and promises, and expectations for restorative justice in the victim community. Experiences with Restorative Justice describes encounters with restorative justice processes, practices and programs. Impediments and Challenges to Restorative Justice details difficulties with implementing and operationalizing core values and practices, including reflections onuncertain prospects. Architecture of Responsive Restorative Justice considers the fundamental features of good practice, including consistency of policy, objectives, processes and outcomes.Summary Reflections on Restorative Justice explores the broader context of concerns with restorative justice policy, practice and potential. The Working Agenda for Restorative Justice enumerates a variety of strategies, short and longer term, for increasing the responsiveness andimpact of restorative practices. The initiative and responsibility for such strategies are dividedbetween the victim and restorative justice communities. Finally, A Conclusion, A Beginningfeatures five themes that captured the most deliberations among project participants in charting acollaborative way forward. back to top Impressions of Restorative Justice There are mixed sentiments about what restorative justice has come to represent. For some, restorative justice promotes a balanced view of crime as an event affecting a number of differentpeople. A justice practice should therefore encourage the direct involvement of these parties,such as promoting needed dialogue between victim and offender. Where the contemporary justicesystem does not work well for victims and others, restorative justice promotes needed change.Restorative justice acknowledges that crime is personal: Adherents of this view often suggest thatassisting victims, addressing their needs and helping them through their problems, and allowingand encouraging victims to participate in processes and outcomes that affect them, are primaryaims of restorative justice. For some victims, working with offenders has been an essentialelement of their own healing journey. But the idea of an offender-oriented restorative justice colors other impressions of its practice. Very often, restorative justice not only reflects offender needs\u2014making amends, and changingand rehabilitating offenders\u2014but also is driven by such needs. Restorative justice may be offender initiated, and may be oriented to an offender timeline. Such needs and practices maynot be compatible with victim needs, however. Where offenders are provided with help to changetheir lives, but victims are not provided help to deal with their trauma, victims feel betrayed bythe offender orientation of restorative justice. Restorative justice may also promote unrealistic or unreasonable goals. Where restorative justice appears to go hand-in-hand with expectations for reduced offender penalties, victims mayperceive restorative justice as a way out for offenders whose primary motivation might be toavoid responsibility or pain. It is often the expectation of restorative justice programs thatoffenders will offer genuine apologies for what they have done. But where offenders are notsorry for what they have done, victims may feel harmed again for this failure of justice.Similarly, restorative justice appears to imply that victims are in some sense obligated to assistoffenders. This distorts the hope of victims to assist themselves through restorative justice processes. Victim participation for the purpose of offender rehabilitation may be at least anunreasonable burden, if not outright objectionable. Ideas that restorative justice is a panacea areimmodest, and without merit. Restorative justice is relatively untried and untested\u2014where is thecompelling proof that it works? For some, restorative justice has not captured the central realities of crime and trauma from avictim's point of view. Restorative justice is the current flavor of the month, and while it may be politically astute to promote ideas of \"victim involvement\" and \"victim centered,\" these appear to be merely afterthoughts and perhaps manipulations of victims. The definitions of restorativejustice are overly broad and confusing, and provide this open invitation for opportunism. Forexample, some mediation groups appear to have turned their attention to violent crime largelydue to the financial incentives for this type of programming. The \"cookie cutter\" approach torestorative justice, despite even profound differences in the circumstances from one jurisdictionto another, reveals a real lack of responsiveness to local needs, and a lack of basic political savvy as well. back to top Experiences with Restorative Justice The view is widely shared that restorative justice may promote offender diversion, court docket relief, easing of jail and prison crowding, and even justice system respite from demands ofvictims. However, restorative justice provides little victim relief. While that objective appears tobe a very low priority, there is nonetheless significant pressure and even coercion to havevictims and victim services join the restorative justice bandwagon. Too often, funding for victimprograms hangs in the balance; the \"choice\" may involve a direct affiliation with restorativejustice programming, or the prospect of no programming at all. In the view of some from thevictim community, it appears that resources set aside in these times for restorative justice haveexceeded, and may have even reduced, resources made available for victim services. The issue of victim input in restorative justice has unfortunately been limited to consideration of victim participation in a particular conference or process. But victims are routinely excludedfrom participation in program planning. In some communities, surrogates are used to assume therole of victims on some reconciliation panels. Very often, training about victims, victim traumaand victim needs involves no victims or victim advocates. But regardless, restorative justicepersonnel are quick to expect or demand that victims become advocates for restorative justice. Many in the victim community feel that while there is significant advocacy and \"talk\" about restorative justice, and though it may be enshrined as the new justice policy, there is too littlepragmatic action taken and few changes are being made, while lines of authority andresponsibility for program development remain obscured. Victim advocates and victim servicespersonnel often have difficulty enlisting restorative justice experts to answer questions or toassist with training needs. Too often, prominent restorative justice practitioners have wadedunsuccessfully into highly visible cases, without proper (and available) consultation and skills,producing in their wake a backlash against restorative justice in the victim community as well asnegative results for victims. With respect to meaningful impact on victim needs, some feel that restorative justice is little different from the justice status quo. For victims, it remains tone deaf to their aspirations. back to top Impediments and Challenges to Restorative Justice A number of assumptions, practices and prospects appear to impede the realization of restorative justice goals. Where restorative justice has come to mean making something go away or bringingsomething back, the idea of \"restoring\" for victims fails on its face. Such language, if not thesentiment behind the language, is at least confusing and often offensive to victims. For many inthe victim community, one type of programmatic response\u2014face-to-face meetings betweenvictim and offender (mediation)\u2014is synonymous with restorative justice. This narrow conceptionof restorative justice seemingly excludes many victims, where offenders are not identified, or offenders refuse to participate in such a process, or where it is inappropriate for such a meetingbetween victim and offender to take place at all. The technique of mediation also presumes a\"dispute\" and a \"relationship\" between victim and offender, and for many victims, this trivializes the nature of deep harms and the character of their relationship to offenders.Further, where financial restitution remains the primary objective of mediation practice, it is questionable whether mediation is at all appropriate for personal crimes involving violence.Domestic violence and sexual assault are certainly ill suited to an intervention with restitution asits centerpiece. Restorative justice presumes to be a rational, contemplative process in response toevents (crimes). But are criminal events rational, involving as they might individuals (offenders)whose damaging and violent choices, coupled with drug, alcohol and mental problems defyrationality to begin with? Such circumstances continue to raise fundamental safety concernsabout restorative justice processes in the eyes of victims. Where restorative justice functions as an adjunct or extension of the formal justice system, there are significant questions about who the \"official\" or \"real\" victim is. The needs of those who areharmed by offenders who have not been identified or arrested are going to be ignored. Theemphasis of restorative justice on how crime affects the community tends, in the view of some,to again marginalize those immediately affected by crime, distorting and diverting justiceresponses to victim needs. Not unlike conventional justice programming and policy, restorativejustice uses victims to promote and rationalize its agenda. Indeed, the very credibility ofrestorative justice is thought by its proponents to hinge upon victim involvement. Despite therhetoric, the experience of the victim community is only too familiar. While victim needs andaspirations are important political fodder for various causes, such needs and aspirations seldomfind resolution in meaningful and sustained victim enfranchisement in justice. And what of the prospects for restorative justice? In some jurisdictions, where limited and routine victim services represent begrudging concessions from the formal justice system to beginwith, there appears to be no room for the development of restorative options. Without credibleevaluation of restorative justice programs, there will continue to be resistance to their blanketimplementation and reluctance in the victim community to embrace them. \"Turf\" disputes aboutthe ownership of restorative justice ideas and programs will deflect from their impact andpotential. In a relatively short period of time, some perceive that restorative justice has becomeoverly professionalized, undermining its professed goals of inclusiveness and accessibility. back to top Architecture of Responsive Restorative Justice The victim community offers numerous suggestions for how restorative justice policy and practice might be responsive to its needs and aspirations. These are targeted to key dimensionsof restorative justice, including its philosophy, policy and practices, and even to broader socialconcerns. A number of key assumptions or tenets should guide restorative justice programming. Not only should victim involvement be reflected in the processes themselves, but the planning andprogramming of restorative justice should have a distinct victim imprint as well. Restorativejustice should be an available option for victims, but it clearly is not suited for every victim, oreven for every offender. When restorative processes are appropriate, and at the direction andinitiation of the victim, direct dialogue with the offender should be a possibility. Some victimsmay choose restorative justice processes to seek levels of closure and peace: These victimsshould receive adequate information about what these possibilities might entail, and then begiven the support to pursue these outcomes. Restorative justice must look well beyond thenarrow view of conventional justice regarding who the \"real\" victim is, to those harms and theirvictims where no offender is identified, or where an offender refuses to participate in restorativejustice processes. Justice for these victims must involve responses that are detached fromoffender-dependent processes. Restorative justice must be mindful that victim interests and needs must be clearly articulated and supported before they are presumed to be included with those of offenders and communities in the name of justice. If victim interests and needs are valuable to the articulation of restorative justice, its proponents should have a vested interest in advocating for the support of victims. Over time, those needs and interests will change, and restorative justice must itself be flexible and dynamic in order to remain responsive to victims. Restorative justice has set for itself an ambitious set of goals and objectives. But from the view of the victim community, it isminimally expected that restorative justice will promote healing for those affected by crime,respect and empathy for victims, tolerance, trust and hope among participants in justice,accountability from offenders, and uniformity, fairness and quality in its processes. On a very practical level, restorative justice programming and processes must accommodate victim needs. For example, victims should be provided with complete information aboutprocesses and possible outcomes, both positive and negative, as a matter of course. Wheneverpossible, restorative justice processes should encourage the involvement of advocates and familymembers of victims (as well as family members of offenders). Processes and outcomes thatinclude restitution must involve efforts to fairly represent the financial situation of the victim(not only that of the offender), including the predicament and challenges caused by a criminalevent. Restorative justice processes must guarantee rights to victims, such as confidentiality, theability to choose to become involved or to cease involvement, the option of reconsidering anoutcome, and the ability to give voice to their own needs and aspirations (in lieu of being side-stepped by surrogate voices, such as prosecution). Under all circumstances, restorative justiceprocesses must provide a safe environment for victims, and its objectives must be premised onoffender accountability to victims and victim respect. Restorative justice might address larger social needs that directly serve the interests of the victim community. For example, restorative justice should be educational in nature, informing not onlyoffenders but also the public about victim trauma. Education about the impact of crime(including the needs of victims), education about offenders and their situations for the victimcommunity, and general education and awareness about restorative justice for justiceprofessionals serve important needs and address glaring deficiencies. It is logical that restorativejustice would concern itself particularly with children and their early, formative educationregarding issues of respect and accountability. Minimally, the currency and popularity ofrestorative justice suggests opportunities for forging new coalitions between victim services andjustice personnel generally, and for encouraging community support of crime victims. back to top Summary Reflections on Restorative Justice A variety of participants in this study, including representatives from the victim community and restorative justice personnel, share an overlay of irony and even skepticism toward thesedeliberations, when the longer view or broader context is taken into consideration; namely, what has been promised versus what has been experienced. These cold and sober realities are essentialconsiderations in developing a comprehensive understanding of restorative justice in this timeand place, and for developing an agenda for justice practice that is responsive to victims' needsand aspirations. Much of the feedback from the victim community about their experience of justice involves injustice, disrespect, exclusion, lack of empathy, and irrelevance. Victim input often emphasizesthe failure of conventional justice to respond to personal and severe trauma, while on the otherhand seeking to limit restorative justice practices to relatively minor offences. Many in the victimcommunity are leery of the promises and record of restorative justice; they remain skeptical thatthe conventional system of justice will ever \"deliver\" for victims. Yet conventional justiceparticipants, while acknowledging that their forays into restorative justice produce little victimimpact (as they are offender-oriented initiatives), remain quite defensive about what they see asthe generally improved availability of victim services over time. The victim community is itself diverse, with often complicated relations between and among victims, victim advocates and victim services. Restorative justice generally seeks to engage amonolith \"victim\" that may not exist in the first place. The victim community often questions thepragmatic differences for their interests and needs between flavors of justice. Victims and their advocates who observe the slow and minimal development of victim services (including the limitations of victim rights) over time often presume that restorative justice will fare no better. Similarly, the poor treatment of victims in conventional justice approaches may well bereplicated in restorative justice programming, particularly where restorative justice is a mereadjunct or extension of the conventional system of justice. It follows for some that negativereactions to restorative justice are related to other elements of the bigger picture, such as theincomplete implementation of victim rights, lack of enforcement of such rights, inadequate victimservices generally, and the marginality of victims in conventional justice processes. While \"victim input\" and \"collaboration\" are allegedly key ingredients of restorative justice, the precise manner in which these operate remains mysterious. Victims talk, yet no one is listening:Such a ritual may be therapeutic for some interests, but certainly not for the victim community.In the many contexts where promoting or implementing any change in justice practices is a struggle, the needed coalitions and alliances may well be beyond the capacity of restorativejustice, itself a fractious collection of interests and personalities. Some in the victim community wonder aloud if victim involvement in restorative justice is a booby prize, a minor accommodation where full participation in justice, victim rights andenforcement of rights, and a full complement of victim services are unlikely scenarios andoutcomes under the conventional justice regime. Further, there is concern for a backlash againstvictim services from restorative justice initiatives irrespective of what they do or do not offervictims. If millions of justice dollars are pumped into new programming that involves little or novictim involvement, participation and control, might this be interpreted as a lack of victim need, or interest, or competence? As noted, a brief survey was sent to all participants in the listening sessions in seven states, with more than 75 percent responding. Regarding the process of the Listening Project, a considerable majority of respondents agreed that the location of the meeting was comfortable and safe,adequate time was reserved for the meeting, they felt at ease with other participants, the groupincluded those who should have been there, and they had the opportunity to express their viewsopenly and be listened to, including their frustrations with restorative justice. Regarding theoutcomes of the meeting, a considerable majority agreed that the event had met their expectations, they were taken seriously by other participants, questions and concerns wereaddressed by the facilitators, and the meeting had raised awareness about both restorative justicegenerally, and victim needs and victim experiences in restorative justice processes. However,beyond the positive appraisal of the process and short-term outcomes of the Listening Project by participants in seven states, the survey data suggests that perhaps the most important conclusionto be drawn concerns the very salience of listening. back to top Working Agenda for Restorative Justice The final sections of this paper present an overview of a two-day, intensive deliberation of the foregoing input of the victim community during listening events in seven states, and proposedagendas or action steps that might be pursued independently or collaboratively by the victimcommunity and restorative justice advocates in the United States. These agendas and action stepsare acknowledged to be only the beginning of a longer conversation that will be needed to workout many crucial details of these proposals, through more discussion and debate. Reactions to the Input of Listening EventsA relatively wide range of responses characterize the reaction to the summary input of the listening events among the victim community and restorative justice advocates assembled for thePhase II palaver. These included general comments, interests and issues that emerged or wereprodded by the input, and efforts to account for (to mitigate or to support) the findings. In general, input varied among the seven venues where listening events were held. A number ofreasons for this seemed probable, including group size and composition, specific backgrounds and direct experiences with restorative justice programming among the states represented (ranging from fairly extensive, to almost none), how tightly or loosely the specific session wasorganized, who comprised the listening team, and whether the listening event was coupled to alarger dialogue or discussion (such as a listening event held in conjunction with a conference orstatewide meeting). Clearly, restorative justice was unfamiliar to some participants in thelistening sessions, and they were responding to either what they had heard about restorativejustice generally, or the local reputation of restorative justice programs and services. In additionto providing input for restorative justice personnel on the needs and experiences of the victimcommunity, the listening events also functioned for some participants as learning opportunitiesabout restorative justice: This appears to have been variable among the sites as well. The findings sparked additional discussion of the very idea of restorative justice. Restorative justice itself was assumed to be a monolith, undifferentiated in its philosophy and practice. It was clear, however, that there was no common, working definition of restorative justice, nor ashared understanding (or agreement) about its benefits. Restorative justice, it was cautioned, doesnot reflect a systemic approach to victim communities of interest or to victim services. Trainingin restorative justice is not uniform. Some thought the findings painted a false dichotomy between advocates of restorative justice and advocates for victims, since some of the latter are themselves passionate about restorativejustice. Further, many victim advocates are hopeful and highly motivated to explore choices for victims. Among victim advocates, some feel the conventional justice system is unlikely to be anymore responsive to victim needs than it is presently, and restorative justice is worth seriousconsideration for this reason alone. Other advocates feel the victim movement has madesignificant strides already, and restorative justice is a distraction or nuisance. The presentation of input from the listening sessions during the two-day discussion was itself a flash point for discussion and debate. Some were concerned that the summary was too negativein its substance and tone, feeling that a more positive and hopeful spin on restorative justicewould be more appropriate. Some recalled specific dialogue leaning to a more positive tone thatdid not seem to be reflected in the summary overview. Others argued that the depiction of victiminput relative to restorative justice was accurate, confirming hunches and experiences, andtruthful (albeit an uncomfortable truth for restorative justice advocates). Participants alsoexpressed concern about the lack of deliberate efforts to differentiate among distinct interestsand needs in the victim community vis a vis restorative justice. Mentioned specifically werevictims of domestic violence and victims of specific ethnic and religious groups. A number of common or synthesizing themes generated broad agreement among participants in the group discussion, as they reflected upon the summary input from the listening meetings. Forexample, victim services often appear to be merely an afterthought to the development, scope,and control and ownership of restorative justice initiatives. This lack of inclusion and lack ofcoalition building fires significant disappointment in restorative justice policy and practice. Thesefailings also clarify to a significant degree the fault line that exists presently between restorativejustice and victim services. Practically, it is manifest in competition for funding and politicalpower, and lack of relevance. It breeds suspicion, skepticism and confusion in the victimcommunity, or worse, reckless restorative justice programming further harms victims. Participants agreed that the dialogue between restorative justice adherents and the victim community has just begun, and its continuation is vital. It is critically important to developdefinitions of restorative justice philosophy, practice and programs that are consistent. Victim-sensitive language is often missing in restorative justice literatures. Similarly, education aboutrestorative justice, including the principles and values upon which it is premised, is vital.Restorative justice might parlay its currency, its political ascendancy and influence, to advocateon behalf of victim interests and needs. Options for victims of violent crime remain desperatelyneeded. And without question, restorative justice must remain vigilant and mindful of its duty toattempt to repair relationships that have been damaged with the victim community.An Agenda for Restorative Justice After careful deliberation on the findings of the listening events and the subsequent analysis and synthesis by a broad representation of study participants, proposals emerged for preliminary andinterrelated action steps targeted to restorative justice advocates and the victim community.These are presented in summary format. While their detailed exposition, ranking of priority and atimeline for action are absent here, such gaps are highly suggestive of the future work andopportunity that remains, some of which have been underway since 2002. Overall, participants recommended that restorative justice practitioners and advocates take leadership roles and responsibility for the following 10 tasks: Continue to engage the victim community and establish ongoing dialogue in all states,including initiatives to conduct local \"listening\" with the victim community. Carefully reconsider the \"cookie cutter\" approach to a diverse victim community; inparticular, reconsider the prospects (opportunities and limits) of restorative justiceapproaches to victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. Re-examine existing restorative justice programming, including the nature of victimparticipation and consultation, and effectiveness of programs relative to victim needs. Pursue matters of peer accountability, appropriate roles, and standards of practice andqualifications of practitioners to maximize positive impact on the victim community andminimize unintended consequences and harms. Mandate training for restorative justice practitioners in victim sensitivity, includingeducation on victim trauma. Training (as well as other forms of technical intervention andassistance) should provide a springboard for collaboration with the victim community andshould include meaningful sponsorship by the local victim community, including planningand delivery roles. Advocacy for restorative justice programming must go hand-in-hand with rigorousevaluation and demonstrable proof of beneficial possibilities for the victims of crime withminimal risk of further harms. The victim community must be consulted in determiningthe appropriate evaluation standards and measures of success and harm to be used. Therestorative justice community must develop a sensitivity and genuine interest in feedbackfrom the victim community on program impact. Renew and invigorate efforts to address the minimal requisite of responsive programming,namely, listening and responding to victim needs. Work in partnership with the victim community, not in competition, to advocate for therequisite justice resources to respond to victim needs. Advocate for victim involvement, control and leadership of programming that intends toaddress victim needs. Carefully delineate between and define restorative justice philosophy and practice, andremain mindful of the need to be very clear about why justice programming shouldinvolve victims, and who program initiatives are designed to serve. A series of action steps are also proposed for the victim community, including its practitionersand advocates, suggesting pivotal and catalytic roles in the following six areas: Develop guidelines and standards for programming in the victim community, includingrestorative justice initiatives that seek to ensure and maximize victim input and impact,and minimize further harm to victims.Advocate for restorative justice where it is responsive to and a reflex of victim needs. Encourage training and education in the victim community on the philosophy and practice of restorative justice. Take an active and leadership role in training (and other technicalinterventions and assistance) for restorative justice advocates and practitioners that enablesthem to work effectively, responsively, and responsibly with the victim community. Maintain a high profile in deliberations of programs that affect victims. Participate inefforts to promote state-wide and national dialogue about responsive justice approaches tothe harms and obligations that flow from crime, as well as local listening initiatives. Continually assess, document, and articulate the concerns and needs of victims. Advocatefor what victims want, even in new and uncomfortable areas. Become more vocal and involved in defining the community role in justice (specifically,the community role in restorative justice), careful to differentiate between what individualvictims need, and the larger context of societal harms and needs. To reiterate, while these items are nominally assigned to either the restorative justice or victimcommunities of interest and practice, they are nonetheless highly interdependent. At the end ofthe day, the commonality of this multifaceted agenda is most likely to produce the desired resultof effective and responsive justice for victims. back to top A Conclusion, A Beginning Five broad areas or themes stood out in the deliberations as opportunities for collaboration between restorative justice advocates and practitioners, victims, victim services personnel, andvictim advocates. These ideas involved considerably more discussion than the foregoing actionpoints and proposals, and there was a clear and convincing sense of urgency and primacy tothese proposals in particular. First, participants advocated structured community dialogue, the purposes of which are to define terminology, identify program models and promising practices, develop appropriate evaluation criteria, and determine the bases and design of meaningful collaboration between the restorativejustice and victim communities. In essence, this action step involves the logical extension of theListening Project to a more focused effort to resolve differences and find areas of mutualconcern and agreement. Additional themes or topics that might be involved in this structuredcommunity dialogue include philosophical issues pertaining to the practice of restorative justice,program viability (resources, timelines and outcomes), funding concerns and resource limitations,unintended consequences, myths and misconceptions in these communities about the other, andspecific applications of restorative justice to types of crimes and types of victim needs. Suchdialogue might also involve specific identification of restorative justice program initiatives thatare failing victims, difficulties in assessing victim needs, and the like. Structured communitydialogue might take place at several different levels, in local communities, state-wide, ornationally (for example, requiring dialogue involving victim participation in decisions about stateand/or federal funding of restorative justice programs). In response to the need for consideration (prospectively in program planning, or retrospectively in program evaluation) of program impact, a second proposal involves deliberate programfeedback . One strategy for providing program feedback might be to make available \"teams\" comprised of representatives of the victim and restorative justice communities to consult withlocal areas, at their invitation, about restorative justice programming. In essence, team memberswith national exposure in their respective areas of expertise (for example, victim servicesprogramming or restorative justice program evaluation) would attempt to provide timely andcost-effective input to local initiatives. Such feedback might include assisting local programs indeveloping suitable options, while advocating for more universal standards of good practice. A complementary mechanism to promote \"feedback\" would be the development of assessment tools or instruments designed to facilitate self-evaluations. A third proposal calls for publication . A consortium, representing a collaboration of both victim and restorative justice communities, might produce a series of monographs, targeted to the interests and needs of specific groups. These might include the courts and policy makers, as wellas the victim community and restorative justice advocates and practitioners. Perhaps the mostvital publication need is a tool for practitioners to be used in the field as a guideline to standards,best practices, and \"how to\" strategies for facilitating local dialogue, program planning,development and implementation, evaluation, and the like. In response to those articulating training and education needs in virtually every aspect of the Listening Project deliberations, a fourth proposal is a collaborative approach to training that would become the norm. Experts in the respective victim and restorative justice communitieswould participate together in all aspects and types of training at the local, state and nationallevels, including various training opportunities at academies and national conferences.Collaborative training objectives would include mutually clarifying restorative justice goals andvalues, working through elicitive training models and techniques, exploring myths andperceptions between the victim and restorative justice communities, and the like. Finally, consistent with the above proposals but acknowledging complexities, the articulation of standards was identified by participants as especially worthy of a collaborative approach. Absent such standards of practice, efforts to evaluate restorative justice programs are thought to bemeaningless. Time and again, participants expressed concerns about poor and unresponsivepractices, even injurious practices, and the very prevalent ambiguities that exist presently aboutwhat constitutes restorative programming. The Listening Project has suggested a wide range ofpossible standards for consideration and implementation, ranging from conditions of victimparticipation to qualifications of restorative justice practitioners. Efforts to collaborativelypropose standards are the next step, as well as further deliberations about ensuring compliancewith minimal standards, and the roles of program audits and evaluations in promoting bestpractice. Strategies for arriving at acceptable standards (successive rounds of structuredcommunity dialogue), the possibility of segmenting standards (identifying minimum, preferredand exemplary standards), and the importance of considering the diversity of communitysettings, needs of victims, and local resources in proposing relevant standards represent onlysome of the many aspects of this critical piece of remaining work. The publication of a paper on the Listening Project should in no way suggest that these critical discussions, deliberations and debate are settled. Far from it, this paper seeks to document an important and challenging conversation that is only in a fledgling stage of listening . It is a conversation in need of amplification, replication, and dogged persistence, certainly in the UnitedStates, but perhaps elsewhere as well. The concluding section of this paper signals only atransition to another phase, an invitation to collaboratively and respectfully pursue mutualinterests in justice for victims. back to top References | Endnotes 1 No effort is made here to suggest the frequency of the various types of responses or input. Instead, the report seeks to comprehensively display the entire range of issues and concerns that were given voice in this project. Giving certain weights to some opinions (such as those voiced most frequently) could suppress or minimize or even marginalize the opinions of other equally valid expressions. Similarly, while there are certainly differences among the seven listening sites(such as the size and composition of the group, and familiarity and experience in a given state with restorative justiceand/or victim rights and/or victim services), their composite contributions are reflected in this paper. This strategy is more conducive to formulating a comprehensive and general strategy for improving restorative justice relative to victim needsand the involvement of the victim services community in the United States.The articles and reviews that appear in Federal Probation express the points of view of the persons who wrote them and not necessarily the points of view of the agencies and organizations with which these persons are affiliated.

Keglovits U.S. Probation Officer, Eastern District of Pennsylvania THE WATER TOWER still looms over the town much as it did on November 15, 1959, the longhorn adorning it (mascot of the local school) bearing silent witness to a half century ofsmall-town life. The railroad tracks still split the town in two and the train still doesn't stop as itruns east and west hauling grain and other commodities produced in the area. Hartman's Caf\u00e9(located \"up on the highway\") is now the El Rancho Caf\u00e9, and the post office (\"down by thedepot\") houses a grocery store. The old post office, a tiny, one-story affair, was onceaffectionately referred to as \"the federal building\" by respectful townsfolk. Tyson Foods has builtan enormous meat-packing plant on the outskirts of town, and the Sunflower Electric generatingstation is nearby, but most outsiders are likely to see the wheat plains, the farms and ranches,and know that Holcomb, Kansas really hasn't changed all that much since the murder of theClutter family forever altered American illusions of small-town serenity. Nothing in the backgrounds of Dick Hickock and Perry Smith would cause one to predict the impossible notoriety later bestowed upon them. They were small-time \"hoods,\" the kind of menthat bloat the roster of parole caseloads across the country. Hickock, age 28 at the time of themurders, born to God-fearing parents in eastern Kansas, grows up on a farm deemed humble byKansas standards, and dreams of a college football scholarship. He is considered to be of aboveaverage intelligence and a very good athlete, but is an underachieving student and a disciplineproblem. The scholarship never materializes and Hickock drifts through a variety of jobs\u2014railroad worker, auto mechanic, ambulance driver\u2014and two marriages. He is involved in aserious car accident in 1950, leaving his face slightly lopsided, his eyes asymmetrical. Hiscriminal record is undistinguished, consisting mainly of bad check charges and petty theft. OnMarch 15, 1958, he is sentenced to five years in the State Penitentiary at Lansing, Kansas for theburglary of a home in Johnson County in which a rifle is taken. Hickock's prison record is clean,and it is dutifully noted that he is \"not dangerous\" (original notes from Kansas State Parole1959). Perry Smith's story is anything but ordinary. Born to a Native American mother and a Caucasian father who seeks fame on the rodeo circuit, his early life is transient and marred by physical andmental abuse. Both parents are alcoholics, and Smith and his siblings are frequent victims ofviolence in their parent's failing marriage. He joins the army in 1948, serves in the Korean War,and is honorably discharged in 1952. Shortly thereafter, he is involved in a motorcycle accidentthat leaves him hospitalized for half a year. Surgery to repair his broken legs leaves himdisfigured, with legs most often termed \"dwarfish.\" The chronic pain also leaves him a self-described \"aspirin addict.\" Smith has no formal education and seems painfully aware of hisacademic deficits. He is largely self-taught and, while in prison, engages in a \"self-improvement\"project of his own design wherein he reads voraciously and determines to improve hisvocabulary by learning a new word every day. His approach seems awkward but sincere. Smith's criminal history is somewhat more sophisticated than Hickock's, but still not a harbinger of the shattering violence to come. In 1952, he is charged with reckless driving and resistingarrest. The charges are later dropped. In July 1955, he is arrested for the burglary of theChandler Pavilion but crawls out of the Phillips County, Kansas jail three days later anddisappears. In 1955, he is cited for vagrancy in Worcester, Massachusetts, where he is freed on a$10 bond and again vanishes. In 1956, he is identified as an escapee and is sentenced on March13, 1956 to five to ten years in the State Penitentiary at Lansing for his previous burglary and\"jail break.\" He is 31 years old when he murders the Clutter family. If Dick and Perry were simply two men living in the same town going about their daily business, it is doubtful the two would have struck up a conversation. Dick the smooth talker, the guy whocould float bad checks from one side of Kansas City to the other with just one flash of thatloopy smile. Dick, the con artist who takes what he wants, whether a television set from theelectronics store or a female who catches his eye. His actions are mainly impulsive and rejectionseems to leave him undiscouraged. Work is for \"squares.\" Dick only needs to find the \"perfectscore\" to provide him with the lifestyle he knows he deserves. Despite his disfiguration, he isstill oddly attractive, projecting boyish enthusiasm and the sort of sociopathic charm reserved forslick criminals. Perry Smith is cautious, polite, as reserved as Dick is outgoing. Smith is a dreamer who loses himself in a fantasy world of his own creation. He buys mail order \"treasure maps\" and conjuresup scenarios of deep-sea diving and discovery of sunken gold in Mexico. Perry knows he canmake his dream a reality if only he can come up with enough money to buy a boat. Perry doesn'tknow how to swim or captain a boat, but with the \"perfect score\" he won't need to worry aboutsuch details. Dick and Perry \"celled\" together at Lansing for a mere two weeks. Perry sees in Dick a deliberative, steady approach that he knows he lacks. Dick also realizes that these traits could bebeneficial on the outside. He also sees in Perry a talent that he knows he doesn't possess, thoseof a natural-born killer. Prison conversations often compensate for other unavailable forms ofentertainment, and fictions are woven with the precision of Hemingway. Perry Smith's abilitiesmay be even better than most. He regales Dick with a tale (later determined to be false) of howhe murdered a man with a bicycle chain in the Nevada desert just to see how it felt. Perry madeenough of an impression to secure a place in Dick's future plans for the \"perfect score.\" After Perry Smith's parole on July 6, 1959 with supervision conditions that state he is not to enter the State of Kansas while on parole or face violation, he dutifully leaves Kansas and again driftsthroughout the country performing odd jobs and living in rooming houses (original notes fromKansas State Parole, 1959). Dick Hickock finishes his tenure at Lansing with a new cellmate,Floyd Wells. Wells, like Dick Hickock, is a thief, serving three to five years for breaking into an electrical appliance store and stealing lawn mowers. Their prison stint is uneventful, their conversations ablend of fact and fiction with one notable exception. Floyd Wells discusses at length his previous\"legitimate\" employment, working for Herbert W. Clutter, owner/proprietor of River Valley Farmin Holcomb, Kansas. He describes a safe located in a home office used by Mr. Clutter thatcontains large amounts of cash. The cash is always on hand, the story goes, to pay the manyemployees of the farm and numerous expenses. Wells' tale of Clutter family wealth is socompelling that Hickock tells Wells, \"As soon as I get out on parole, I'm going to find me sometransportation, get ahold [sic] of Smith and go to the Clutters' and see if there's still $10,000 intheir damned safe\" (original case notes from Kansas Bureau of Investigation contained instatement made to Agent Wayne Owens by Floyd Wells, 1959). Hickock is relentless in hisquestioning of Wells. He wants to know the ages of the children, and the lay-out of the house.He tells Wells repeatedly that he will kill the family, leaving no witnesses. Wells contends thathe never believed him, chalking up the banter to just plain prison talk, stories to pass the time.Herb Clutter, 48 years old, was one of the most respected men in all of Finney County, Kansas. He was a college graduate and successful wheat farmer, a community leader who could always be counted on to lend a hand. His wife Bonnie, 45, at one time Herb's energetic and supportivepartner, was now given to prolonged periods of depression, \"spells,\" and rarely left the confinesof their spacious home. Her struggles did not stop her from doting on her two children whoremained at home, Nancy, 16, and a son, Kenyon, 15. Two older daughters had married andmoved away, starting families of their own. The Clutters are decent, hard-working folks whoembody the lessons that Nancy teaches her Sunday school class at the First Methodist Church inneighboring Garden City. Dick Hickock is paroled on August 13, 1959, and resides with his parents while securing a job as an auto mechanic at Bob Sands' Garage in Olathe. Floyd Wells later tells investigators,\"Hickock told me that he had arranged for some kind of job in Kansas City in order to get hisparole. That he'd have to make some kind of pretense of working there for awhile\" (1959). Wellsknew that Dick Hickock's real intentions had nothing to do with car repair. Hickock writes toPerry Smith several times before finally reaching him at a post office box in Idaho. Despite hisawareness of parole conditions, and a sense of foreboding about a return to Kansas, he agrees tomeet Dick and boards a bus for Olathe. Hickock has written about his plan to make big money,describing a scenario that, in Hickock's typically grandiose fashion, is termed a \"cinch.\" Truman Capote's masterpiece, In Cold Blood, proves once again that a true story well told can be as compelling as any work of pure fiction. The facts of the crime, the setting, the characters, and the inevitable conclusion, need no embellishment to heighten the drama. On November 14, 1959,Dick and Perry leave Olathe in a '49 Chevy \"borrowed\" by Hickock, taking a circuitous route toHolcomb. Four hundred miles and several hours later they enter Garden City, stopping for gas atthe Phillips 66. A short ride and they cross the railroad tracks of Holcomb, knowing that RiverValley Farm is but a mile and a right turn away. Under a full moon and nearing midnight, thetwo killers travel the dirt road to the Clutter home. The bright autumn night is partially maskedby the Chinese elms that form a canopy over the road. The Clutter home is within view. Theirpath seems clear but for a light that flashes on in the nearby home of the Clutters' resident farmhand. The worker is merely tending to a sick child but the interruption is enough to cause Dickto momentarily reconsider and he turns the car around. The interplay between criminals is a curious one. Left to his own devices, would Dick have continued down the road away from the farm, leaving the Clutters' to sleep undisturbed throughthe night? With a partner, a \"prison buddy\" at that, was there more to prove? Perry Smithrelates, \"Halfway down the road Dick stopped. He was sore as hell. I could see he was thinking,here I've set up this big score, here we've come all this way, and now this punk wants to chickenout. He said, \"Maybe you think I ain't got the guts to do it alone. But by God, I'll show youwho's got guts\" (Capote, T., 1965, p. 235). Dick and Perry return to the house, parking at a sideentrance and approach the unlocked door leading to the small home office kept by Mr. Clutter.They enter, Hickock carrying a knife and Smith a shotgun. Guided only by a flashlight, theysearch for the safe described so meticulously by Floyd Wells. The house is quiet. The family asleep. The search of the small paneled office yields nothing. Where is the safe that Floyd Wells described, located just behind Herb Clutter's desk? The twocontinue through the house, less than careful about the noise they may be making. Herb Clutter,asleep in his bed, is awakened by a flashlight shining in his eyes. Dick and Perry have traveledthe length of Kansas to steal the contents of Clutter's safe and they are not leaving emptyhanded. Mr. Clutter is taken by gunpoint into his office where he repeatedly tells the intrudersthat he has no safe. He offers to write them a check and give them the contents of his wallet (amere $30.00) if they will only leave his family in peace. In total, two hours are spent in the house. One by one the family awakens. Mr. Clutter and son Kenyon are taken to the basement where they are separated and hog-tied. Mr. Clutter is orderedto lie down on the cement floor while Kenyon is taken to a sofa kept in a side room. NancyClutter, in her bedroom on the second floor, is tied to her bedpost and Mrs. Clutter is removedfrom her bedroom and placed in the upstairs bathroom where she too is tied. Their mouths are also taped shut. Absurdly, comfort is offered as Perry, fearing that Mr. Clutter is likely cold on the basement floor, places cardboard underneath him. Kenyon's restraints are loosened slightly as he complains they are too tight and a pillow placed under his head. Mrs. Clutter is offered achair as she stands in the bathroom, waiting to be escorted back to her bed to die. One by onethe killing starts. Returning to the basement, Perry goads Dick to use the knife on Herb Clutteras if to prove that Dick is too \"chicken\" to carry out his own plan. The man who vowed to\"spread hair on them walls\" (Capote, T., 1965, p. 37) seems incapable of doing so, but also doesnothing to stop Perry Smith. Perry grabs the knife from Dick and, in what is rapidly becoming abizarre competition between the two, sets the violence in motion. Kneeling on the floor, Perryslices the throat of Herb Clutter. Perry challenges Dick to \"finish him off\" but is unable, orperhaps unwilling, to literally get the blood on his hands and begs off. Mr. Clutter, makingsickening gurgling sounds from the cut to his throat is shot at close range by Perry as Dicktrains the flashlight on him. Kenyon, Nancy, and Bonnie Clutter reach identical fates as thekillers methodically march through the house true to their pact to leave no witnesses. The drama unfolding in the house has been the subject of conjecture by psychologists and criminal justice practitioners for almost 50 years. Much can be made of Perry's cruel and oftenviolent upbringing, but what accounts for Dick's criminal behavior? Certainly not his family life.Geneticists can perhaps argue for the existence of a \"murderous gene,\" which would certainlysimplify the argument. Some would contend that Dick's exposure to the state prison systemhardened him, turning a petty thief into a man capable of cold-blooded brutality. But his prisonrecord indicates a favorable adjustment void of misconducts and disciplinary actions. One canspeculate that acting as individuals, Dick and Perry may not have been capable of murder.Acting as a team, murder may have been inevitable. It seems that Dick's big talk and his detailedplans left him little room for back-tracking. When he turned around in the Clutters' driveway hecould have kept going but he chose to carry through with his plan despite his sense offoreboding. Appearing to be a coward seemed to present more of a risk at that moment than theconsequences of multiple murder. Perry Smith, slowly realizing that Dick Hickock might not beable to back up the tough image he liked to project, admits to trying to call Dick's bluff. Heseems to exploit Dick's \"weakness\" when he asks for the knife. Perry later claims that he was\"bluffing\" Dick and expected him to talk him out of slashing Herb Clutter's throat. He wantedDick to admit that he was a \"phony.\" The wheels were already in motion and to try and deterPerry at this point would be akin to admitting cowardice. The murders really had nothing to dowith the Clutters. From the moment they left Olathe in the stolen Chevy, the drama was allabout Dick and Perry. Perhaps the most chilling words ever uttered were offered by Perry Smithwhen he later described his brief encounter with Herbert Clutter. Leaning into him with a knifein his hand, Perry \"really doesn't want to harm the man. I thought he was a very nice gentleman.Soft-spoken. I thought so right up to the moment I cut his throat.\" (Capote, T., 1965, p. 244). The coroner's photographs reveal the destruction of four lives (original notes and photographs, coroner's office, Finney County, Kansas, 1959). The shotgun blasts all but obliterate what wereonce human features. The girl who baked apple pies and rode her old farm horse \"Babe,\" the boywho tinkered with his vintage truck, the mother and father who instilled respect and the value ofhard work in their children, are reduced to swollen, devastated caricatures. The cost of fourlives? A pair of binoculars, a Zenith portable radio, four silver dollars, and approximately $40.00in cash. The killers overlooked Nancy's church envelope, dutifully placed on her bureau forservices the next morning, containing two dollars. There was no safe. There was no $10,000. By the afternoon of November 15, 1959, word of \"trouble out at the Clutter place\" has traveled through Holcomb and most of Finney County. By the end of the week, word has traveledthroughout most of the United States. Murder of this magnitude just didn't happen to farmfamilies in the heartland of America. The historical importance of this crime cannot beunderestimated. Although not officially documented as such, the murder of the Clutter familyhits the popular imagination as the first mass murder in America. This crime comes close on theheels of Charles Starkweather's murder spree that began in Nebraska in December, 1957 and alsocaptured media attention across the country. Starkweather, accompanied by his teenage girlfriendCaril Fugate, who literally appears to have been along for the ride, stalked the West in a stolen vehicle shooting to death numerous victims until their capture in Wyoming in late January 1958. The Starkweather killings are unofficially touted as the first serial murders in the U.S. and became the inspiration for Bruce Springsteen's seminal work, \"Nebraska,\" as well as theTerrence Malick film, \"Badlands.\" (The role the media played at this particular time cannot beunderestimated. The idea of \"mass media\" was just starting to take hold. The reporting of crimewas no longer a parochial event. Until the Starkweather, Hickock and Smith crimes, killing ofthis magnitude was viewed as politically motivated. Until the late 1950s, and with the obviousexception being war coverage, one of the few mass murders to receive national attention was the1927 bombing of a school in Bath, Michigan in which 42 people died. This crime also had itsroots in political unrest, however, as the perpetrator, Andrew Kehoe, allegedly ignited dynamitehe had planted in the school's basement as a protest of new school taxes. What perhaps made theStarkweather killing spree and the Clutter murders significant and seen as the baseline by whichother crimes were measured was the personal nature of the acts. America had not yet heard thenames Richard Speck, Charles Whitman, Charles Manson, or John Wayne Gacy.) Nationwideattention now focuses on the events in Kansas. Truman Capote, sitting in his apartment inBrooklyn, reads an article in The New York Times , \"Wealthy Farmer, 3 of Family Slain.\" (1959, November). The article recounts: \"A wealthy farmer, his wife and their two young children werefound shot to death today in their home. They had been killed by shotgun blasts at close rangeafter being bound and gagged.\" So begins Capote's odyssey, culminating six years later with thepublication of In Cold Blood . Floyd Wells, Dick Hickock's former cell mate, hears of the murders when listening to his radiowhile lying on his bunk at the Kansas State Penitentiary where he remains after Hickock'sparole. Despite the incessant conversations with Hickock on this very subject, Wells later claimsto be shocked by the news. Two weeks pass and eventually Wells can no longer live with theburden of his secret. The fact that a well-publicized reward is being offered may also beweighing on him. Wells arranges to be \"called out\" to the warden's office under a false pretense.He doesn't want to be known as a prison snitch and is about to give very damaging informationabout two former inmates. The following statement is made by Floyd Wells to Agent WayneOwens of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation (KBI) on December 10, 1959 and is taken fromoriginal (unpublished) case notes: I spent considerable time with him (Herb Clutter) in his \"office\" where he had adesk and I believe a safe. This was the old house where the Clutters lived in 1949(also located on the Clutter farm property). This was just about the time their newhouse was completed. I distinctly remember Mr. Clutter paying a large lumber billand I thought he paid it in cash with money from the safe. The reason I rememberis because Mr. Clutter made the remark to me that evening when we left his denthe he'd paid out more than $10,000 that day. After entering Kansas State (Penitentiary) I \"celled\" with Dick Hickock. Hickock said he liked western Kansas and maybe would try to get a job with the Clutters. Idescribed the location of the house. I suspect I talked too much about the moneyMr. Clutter had. Hickock talked a lot about Perry Smith. Said after they got out ofthe 'joint' they could pull some jobs to get enough money for a down payment ona boat. They would run a charter service for deep sea fishermen and eventuallymake contacts and use the boat to bring in narcotics. I didn't believe Hickock buthe kept talking about it. I tried to talk him out of it, said he would get caught. Buthe said he had a plan, and, after the robbery would kill everyone there and leaveno witnesses. As it turned out, Wells did speak \"too much about the money\" and tragically, much of what hehad to tell Dick Hickock was, at best, clouded by the passage of time. His statement is extremely significant and not only because it introduces the detectives to Dick Hickock. Volumes have been written about this case and Capote's meticulous research andaccess to the principals is without parallel. Is it possible that Capote did not have Wells' statement available to him? It appears that a very meaningful piece of information may havebeen overlooked: Wells fills Dick Hickock with stories of Herb Clutter's wealth and how cash is contained within an office safe. But he is speaking of \"the old house where the Clutters lived in 1949, just about the time their new house was completed.\" Hickock and Smith burglarize thenew house, where there is no safe! Perhaps Floyd Wells truly thought that strict attention todetail really didn't matter, after all he was just passing the time in prison. Could he have thoughtthat his blending of details was irrelevant as he didn't really believe Hickock's boasts of how hewould one day rob and likely murder the Clutters? Wells' protestations stretch the bounds ofbelievability. After all, he provided intimate details of the family members and a map leading toRiver Valley Farm. He may not have thought Hickock capable of this level of violence, but hesurely knew that Dick Hickock was indeed capable of burglary. Wells was likely concernedabout being implicated in the crime as he had clearly provided information about the Cluttersthat literally led Dick and Perry to their door. His statement to detectives, although self-servingand deliberately vague in parts, breaks the case. After their eventual capture, Dick Hickock tellsKBI agents that Floyd Wells was not just passing the time in prison by telling him about HerbClutter. Interestingly, Hickock claims that Wells was to receive $2500 from the robbery. Themoney was to be spent to hire an attorney to work on his appeal (original case notes fromKansas Bureau of Investigation interview of Dick Hickock, Las Vegas, Nevada, 1960). On December 30, 1959, at approximately 5:25 pm, Dick Hickock and Perry Smith are apprehended in Las Vegas, Nevada, by patrolmen on routine duty who are in possession of an\"all points bulletin\" and mug shots of Hickock and Smith. The assailants are driving a 1956Chevrolet stolen in Iowa shortly after their aborted trip to Mexico. Their dreams of buying a boat and diving for sunken treasure ran up against reality with remarkable swiftness. Forty dollars and a few items suitable for the pawnshop were not enoughto bankroll the type of operation they had envisioned. In short order, the two returned to the U.Sand lived out of stolen cars while traversing much of the country. They even returned to Kansasbriefly where Dick boldly engaged in another surprisingly successful check-writing spree. Timewas running out however, and at the time of their arrests, they had nothing of value but thestolen car in which they were sitting. Dick Hickock and Perry Smith were returned to Finney County, Kansas where they were housed on the fourth floor of the courthouse in two of the six cells that comprised the county jail. InMarch, 1960, a trial was held but was viewed as anti-climatic. After testimony of several daysand forty minutes of deliberation, the jury returned with guilty verdicts and set the punishment atdeath. Interestingly, Perry Smith eventually admitted that he had killed the four members of theClutter family. He didn't want Dick Hickock's parents, elderly and in poor health, to go to theirgraves thinking their son a killer. Hickock and Smith were transferred to the Kansas StatePenitentiary in Lansing where they remained on death row until April 14, 1965. Slightly aftermidnight the two were partners for the last time as they walked the thirteen steps leading to thewooden platform and the hangman's noose. Dick and Perry were buried on the prison grounds but were later moved to make way for a prison expansion project. Their current resting place, section 34, row 29 in the Mount MuncieCemetery in Leavenworth County, is identified by simple markers. Their original headstones,bought by Truman Capote, were stolen. The beauty of this pastoral site is disconcerting. Theconflict between the violence of their lives and the serenity of this resting place defies cliche. It'sjarring to be here. The Clutters, Herbert, Bonnie, Nancy and Kenyon, were laid to rest in Valley View Cemetery in Garden City. The graves are still graced with flowers and a fresh bouquet marking Mother's Dayis placed at the headstone of Mrs. Clutter. A visit to the cemetery oddly brings the crime to life.\"Nancy Mae Clutter, born 1943, died 1959.\" Nancy was a real girl. She had a real boyfriend,Bobby, and a best friend, Susan. She rode her farm horse, Babe, and baked really good applepies. Nancy was brutally murdered in 1959. She was shot to death in her own bed having gottenup just long enough after hearing the intruders to hide her prized possession, a watch given toher by her father, in her shoe.The Clutter farm has in some sense taken on the patina of \"urban legend.\" Local teenagers drive down the dirt road leading to the farm late at night finding entertainment in the horror as teenagers often do. There is also a simultaneous respect and reverence about the place and thefamily. After first hearing that local residents don't want to talk about the crime and prefer toleave things alone, one is struck by how nearly everyone wants to talk about it! About theirconnection to the farm or the family or the crime. It is an event that is as much a part of thetown as the water tower. It is not trivialized. After the murders, the farm and its contents were sold at auction, the surviving Clutter daughters understandably deciding that trying to maintain the family farm was emotionally unbearable. Theauction was considered a success with nearly everything associated with River Valley Farm sold(including Babe, for $75). The residence has since changed hands two more times. The home isoccupied and the farm is worked to this day. A German Shepherd roams the property, serving asa sentry. A crime that was motivated by financial gain had a very cheap payoff. The lives of ultimately six individuals were traded for a pair of binoculars, a Zenith portable radio, four silver dollars andapproximately $40.00 in cash. There was no safe. There was no $10,000. back to top The articles and reviews that appear in Federal Probation express the points of view of the persons who wrote them and not necessarily the points of view of the agencies and organizations with which these persons are affiliated.

We have accumulated evidence across four studies that findthe neurotic group of offenders to be of particular interest to correctional practitioners and policymakers. They have made poor adjustments to prison, had the highest long-term recidivism rates,performed poorly in a cognitive skills intervention and assist in differentiating child molesters.The findings also illustrate that personality is an important factor across a number of differentsamples, lending support for the reliability of the Jesness Inventory. Psychological, personality-based classification systems have been used since the 1960s to develop differential treatment and supervision plans for offenders (Van Voorhis, 2000). Thisapproach assumed that, even apart from their risk of re-offending, offenders were not all alikeand that no single treatment modality worked with all types of offenders across the full spectrumof correctional settings (Warren, 1971; Palmer, 1974). In support, the early proponents ofdifferential treatment found that offenders who were placed in treatment modalities matched topersonality characteristics were more likely to perform better than those who wereinappropriately placed (Jesness, 1971; Palmer, 1974; 2002; Warren, 1983). More contemporary writings place personality among a larger group of offender responsivity factors (Andrews, Bonta, and Hoge, 1990), including learning styles, motivation levels,intellectual functioning, and other traits, which are likely to become barriers to the success ofsome types of interventions. Notwithstanding the promising results of studies conducted throughthe 1970s and 1980s, responsivity remains under-researched and seldom considered incorrectional practice. Indeed, responsivity is a frequent topic of discussion in correctional policymeetings, non-empirical writings, and staff training, but it is seldom structured into currentcorrectional practice or research. This article summarizes the results of four recent studies that employed an offender-based personality typology (using the Jesness Inventory, 1996) to examine the importance ofpersonality in prison adjustment, long-term offender recidivism, success in cognitiveprogramming, and dynamics of child molestation. Across these samples of male offenders, wefound a consistent pattern suggesting that high-anxiety offenders, those referred to as neurotic offenders on the personality classification systems, are distinct from other offenders in extremely important ways. The findings urge renewed consideration not only of offender personality butalso of a distinct type of offender who receives limited attention in contemporary correctionaltreatment. As noted in more detailed descriptions of the offender personality typologies (e.g., see Warren, 1971, Van Voorhis, 1994; Van Voorhis & Sperber, 1999), the neurotic personality type is one offour offender personality types common to the various personality classification systems(Megargee & Bohn, 1979; Quay, 1983; Jesness, 1988, 1996; Warren, commontypes and their descriptions are as follows: I-level, as measured by the Jesness Inventory, identifies nine personality types * Among adults, these can be collapsed into the following four types (Van Voorhis, 1994) that are of primary interest to the present study: a) antisocial, who are described as manipulative, hostile, andpossessing antisocial values and peers; b) neurotic, or highly anxious, defensive, and insecure; c)dependent, described as dependent, followers, who do not evidence antisocial values/attitudes;and d) situational, who are prosocial, conforming, and, at times, nave. The pattern across variousI-level studies finds that types comprising the antisocial offenders (e.g., Aa, CFC, MP) and theneurotic offenders (e.g., Na, Nx) most often differentiate offenders in terms of their success inprograms (e.g. 1983), their offense patterns (e.g., Harris, 1979;Heide, 1992,1999), and their prison adjustments (Van Voorhis, 1994). In narrowing our focus to the neurotic offender, it is important to remember that anxiety can exist both as a state of mind and as a personality trait. The type of neuroticism discussed heredoes not relate to the general feeling of anxiety that most experience in response to situationalpressures (e.g., anxiety over a licensing exam or a loved one's illness). Here we are concernedwith anxiety as a trait, an enduring characteristic that more persistently influences individualperceptions and behavior. Studies conclude that individuals higher in trait anxiety areconsistently more prone to perceive greater danger in their relationships and to respond withgreater elevations of situational or state anxiety (Speilberger, 1985). Individuals with high traitanxiety, often called negative affectivity, tended to have a very negative view of themselves, toworry more often, and to dwell on frustrations and disappointments (Watson & Clark, 1984).Moreover, individuals high in neuroticism were shown to be more distressed on average incomparison to low neuroticism subjects and to have lower thresholds for responding to stressfulevents (Bolger & Schillings, 1991). Although some individuals may experience these feelings asa state of mind during times of stress, those high in negative affectivity manifest these feelingseven in the absence of stress (Watson & Clark, 1984). Although personality was neglected for many years in criminology, recent research finds it to be an important predictor of behavior. For example, research by Caspi, Moffitt, Silva, Stouthamer-Loeber, Kreuger, and Schmutte (1994) found that low constraint and negative emotionality werepredictors of criminal behavior regardless of age, geographic location, race, and gender. Further,constraint and negative emotionality emerged as correlates among life-course persistent offenders(Kreuger, Schmutte, Caspi, Moffitt, Campbell, & Silva, 1994). Traits pertaining to negativeemotionality and low constraint were also implicated in relationship difficulties (Moffitt, 1993)and health risk behaviors (e.g., violent crime, alcohol dependence, sexual behavior, anddangerous driving habits) (Caspi, Harrington, Moffitt, Begg, Dickson, Langley & Silva, 1997).Finally, Agnew, Brezina, Wright & Cullen (2002) found that \"strain is more likely to lead todelinquency among those high in negative emotionality/low constraint\" (p. 63). Importantly, thestudy also concluded that those high in negative emotionality and low in constraint did notengage in delinquency in the absence of strain. Since their inception, correctional, psychological classification systems have staked a clear position for the neurotic, high anxiety, offender. With youth in California, these delinquents werediagnosed as either neurotic anxious or neurotic acting-out according to the Interpersonal Maturity Level (I-level) classification system (Warren et al., 1966; Palmer, 2002). In the FederalBureau of Prisons, the Quay Adult Internal Management System (Quay, 1983) identified a neurotic anxious type for adults. The Quay System for juvenile offenders put forward a similar type (Quay and Parsons, 1971). Finally, the Megargee MMPI based Prison Typology (Megargeeand Bohn, 1979) notes types Baker, George, and Jupiter. All are described as dealing with formsof trait anxiety. Early writings offered some concerns about these individuals, as exemplified by the type descriptions of the neurotic offender. For example, sources asserted that neurotic offenders madepoor adjustments to prison settings; needed to be placed away from predatory inmates; did notimprove without intervention; and were likely to amplify rather than resolve acting-out behaviorswhen confronted by staff. Warren described this group of individuals as having a \"good deal ofinternal 'wear and tear' involving anxiety, guilt, a 'bad me' self image, 'negative life script'distorted perceptions, and dysfunctional behavior.\" Delinquency has some private meaning and isnot intended simply for material gain or as a response to peer pressure. It may involve acting outof a family problem, an identity crisis, or a long-standing internal conflict. These individualsmay also show symptoms of emotional disturbance, chronic or intense depression, orpsychosomatic complaints. Both the Preston Topology Study (Jesness, 1971) and the Community Treatment Project (CTP) in California (Palmer, 1974; 2002; Warren, 1983) reported that outcomes were better for theseyouth under conditions of differential treatment that accommodated anxiety and targeted it fortreatment. Differential treatment also involved \"matching\" offenders to officers and staff trainedto counsel issues related to anxiety. When anxiety was accommodated, the neurotic delinquentsshowed more impressive treatment gains than most of the other groups (Palmer, 1974). But thedevelopment of correctional strategies for these offenders ceased in the 1970s. Current thinking on offender therapy favors cognitive behavioral programs targeted to thinking skills, thinking errors, high risk situations, and coping strategies. This focus is well-supported bya large body of research, and confirmed by several meta analyses conducted in the 1990s. Tofacilitate consistent delivery, most current cognitive behavioral models are directed by manualsfor facilitators. Some are scripted; most suggest activities such as role-playing exercises, thinkingreports and group discussions. These are not intended to be confrontational, a well knowndifficulty for highly anxious offenders. One would think that an emphasis on how to thinkthrough difficult situations and to deal with emotions would be useful to such offenders; howeverthe same models do not appear to have been developed with anxiety in mind. In referring to offender anxiety as a \"responsivity trait\" (Andrews and Bonta, 1998; Andrews, Bonta, and Hoge, 1990), it is assumed to affect one's ability to succeed in correctional programsand environments. A number of authors suggest that we should consider these attributes whenscreening offenders into programs, so that they are not \"harmed\" by the intervention or expectedto participate in an intervention that does not work. Unfortunately, once we have screenedneurotic offenders out of programs (if we do) there appear to be no contemporary alternatives.Consequently, the current generation of offender programming has little to say, directly, aboutanxiety. Research examining these concerns is summarized below. back to top Description of the Studies The four studies measured personality according to the Jesness Inventory (Jesness, 1996). In addition to 11 personality scales, the JI provides subtype scales, which correspond to earlierpersonality subtypes identified by the Interpersonal Maturity Classification System. Nine subtypesare put forward by the Jesness Inventory. For adults, these nine types may be collapsed furtherinto four types (see Van Voorhis, 1994): a) antisocial, b) neurotic, c) dependent, and d)situational. Study 1: The first study explored the comparative viability of several psychological classification systems for classifying adult male prison inmates. The relationship between the types identified by each classification system and prison adjustment emerged as an important issue. The study sampled two groups of federal inmates newly admitted to prison between September 1986 and July 1988: a) 179 maximum custody inmates (response rate = 76%); and b) 190 minimumcustody inmates (response rate = 90%). At prison admission, the study participants completeddetailed background interviews and several psychological inventories, including the JesnessInventory. Table 1 details the background characteristics of the sample. Inmates were tracked for 6 to 9 months. Follow-up data cited in this paper consisted of self report measures of prisonmisconducts and stress. The self-report and staff measures were cumulative scales and hadinternal consistency (alpha values) greater than 0.70. Stress was measured by the Center forEpidemiological Studies Depression Scale (Radloff, 1977). The study utilized bivariate analyses.See Van Voorhis (1994) for a more detailed account of the measures and methodology of thestudy. Study 2: The second study explored whether personality, as measured by the Jesness Inventory, was related to recidivism. A longitudinal design examined long-term recidivism rates for thestudy 1 cohort of federal prison inmates (n=277) over a 10 to 12 year period. Table 2 details the background characteristics of the sample. Recidivism data, collected through NCIC in 1998,were available for approximately 85 percent of the time 1 sample. Event history analysis wasemployed to determine the relationship between the four collapsed Jesness Inventory types andoutcome. Failure was defined as any new arrest and arrest for a specific charge including drugs,property offenses, or violence. Control variables included race and a modified version of theSalient Factor Score (Hoffman and Beck, 1985). See Listwan (2001) for a more detailed accountof the measures and methodology of the study. Study 3: The third study, Phase II of the Georgia Cognitive Skills Experiment, examined the effectiveness of the Reasoning and Rehabilitation (R&R) (Ross & Fabiano, 1985) program onparolees across the State of Georgia. A focal issue of the study was whether some types ofoffenders responded differently to the cognitive skill intervention than others. Using anexperimental design, male parolees were randomly assigned to either the R&R program group(n=574) or the control group (n=581) that received standard parolee services without the R&Rprogram. Table 3 illustrates the background characteristics of the individuals under study. Program effectiveness was determined, in part, by comparing experimental group and controlgroup \"failure\" during a 30 month follow up period. Event history analysis was utilized andfailure was defined as a return to prison. Control variables used in the study included risk, ahistory of violence, IQ, reading level, education, marital status, age, and race. See Van Voorhis,Spruance, Ritchie, Listwan, Seabrook, and Pealer (2003) for a more detailed account of themeasures and methodology of the study. Study 4: This study examined whether an existing offender typology\u2014the Jesness Inventory\u2014 could differentiate among child molesters on such characteristics as denial, empathy,endorsement of cognitive distortions, and self-esteem. The study sample was comprised of 85men convicted of a sexual offense against a minor; all were involved in correctional treatment atthe time of the study. Each participant completed the Jesness Inventory as well as four othervalidated assessments designed to measure the dependent variables: Sex Offence InformationQuestionnaire Revised (Hogue, 1998), the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (Davis, 1983), the Abeland Becker Cognitions Scale (Abel, Gore, Holland, Camp, Becker, and Rathner, 1989), and theRosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965). Additional data collected from eachparticipant's program file measured offender demographics, offense characteristics, victimcharacteristics, and the offender's risk of re-offending as measured by the Static-99 (Hanson,1997). Table 4 summarizes the sample characteristics. The analysis used analysis of variance and analysis of covariance strategies. See Sperber 2003 for a more detailed discussion of themethodology and measures used in the study. back to top Results Study 1: Neurotic offenders had the highest proportion of self-reported aggression in both the maximum custody and minimum custody groups. Results were significant for the minimum custody sample (p <0.01) but not the maximum custody group. More telling, perhaps, were findings for stress and depression experienced shortly into the prison term. As shown in Figure 1 , neurotic offenders scored the highest on the CESD scale. Results were statistically significant (p<0.05) for both the minimum custody and maximum custody groups. On other measures,neurotic offenders performed similar to the antisocial type, or were not differentiated in anymeaningful way from the other three personality types. Study 2: As shown in Figure 2 , the findings from the discrete-time, event history analysis of the effect of personality on recidivism indicated that personality contributed to the prediction of criminal behavior even when controlling for race and risk. More importantly, the highestprobabilities for rearrest were among the neurotics, followed by the antisocials, situationals, anddependents. The neurotics and antisocials had a significantly higher probability of experiencingre-arrest than the dependents. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 3 , the neurotics alone were significantly different from the other three types when predicting drug offenses. They were morelikely to become involved in substance abuse than the other personality types, and they incurredthe offenses in closer proximity to their release than the other offenders. Personality was notsignificant in the models predicting property or violent offenses. Study 3: Phase II of the Georgia Cognitive Skills Experiment raised the question of whether offenders' personalities affected how they responded to a cognitive skills program, and thequestion was answered in the affirmative. Results from discrete-time, event history analysisindicated that neurotics responded adversely to the R&R program; neurotic offenders whoparticipated in the program were returned to prison at significantly higher rates than neuroticoffenders in the control group. Although only 35.3 percent of neurotic control group membersrecidivated, over half (54.8 percent) of neurotic experimental group members were reincarceratedby the end of the 30-month follow up period. The neurotic X experimental group interaction wassignificant (B = 0.80; p <0.05), as was the event history analysis model which included controlsfor risk level, history of violence, IQ, reading level, education, marital status, age, and race(model chi square = 103.25; p <0.001). In contrast to the detrimental effects of the program onneurotics, parolees classified as antisocial, dependent, or situational improved slightly, though notsignificantly, by participating in the program (see Van Voorhis et al., 2002). Study 4: While the results of this study supported the hypothesis that child molesters of varied personality types would differ on key psychological attributes, the extent to which the neuroticchild molesters differed from the other personality types was of particular interest. For example,analysis of variance revealed that the personality subtypes differed significantly on three of thedependent measures\u2014self-esteem, personal distress (an affective component of empathy), andfantasy (an intellectual component of empathy). The post hoc comparisons, outlined in Table 5 , revealed that it was the neurotic child molester that was significantly different from the otherthree personality types. For example, neurotic child molesters had the highest score on thepersonal distress scale, meaning that they were the most likely to feel emotional discomfort inthe presence of another's suffering. In addition, the antisocial offenders, situationals, anddependents scored similarly on the fantasy scale. Neurotics scored significantly higher, however,indicating that they were significantly more likely to identify with others on an intellectual level.The neurotic child molesters also evidenced significantly lower self-esteem scores than the otherthree groups. back to top Conclusions In sum, we have accumulated evidence across four studies that find the neurotic group of offenders to be of particular interest to correctional practitioners and policy makers. They havemade poor adjustments to prison, had the highest long-term recidivism rates, and appeared tohave been harmed by the most prevalent correctional intervention in use at the present time.Moreover, the neurotic child molesters are different from other child molesters (as well as fromstereotypes pertinent to child molesters) in ways that should factor into their treatment andtherapy. These findings are important for several reasons. First, they offer additional support to criminologists researching individual-centered theories of crime. The findings are in contrast tothe earlier reviews of personality and crime (e.g., Schuessler & Cressey, 1950; Tennenbaum,1977; and Waldo & Dinitz, 1967) and claims by researchers such as Vold and Bernard (1986),who argue that personality provides no theoretical relevance to understanding criminal behavior.While accumulating studies are finding a relationship between personality and criminal behavior,many of these studies are conducted with adolescents and young adults (Caspi et al., 1994; Caspiet al., 1997; Krueger et al., 1996). The present studies note consistent results with respect toadult males. Three of the studies (study 1 and 2 were of approximately the same sample) used different samples of offenders to explore the utility of the Jesness Inventory in predicting or differentiatingoffenders and their behaviors. The consistency of findings across different samples, added to theresults of studies cited above, lends strong support to the external validity of findings regardingneurotic offenders. Accumulating research carries implications for offender risk assessment, correctional management, and offender programming. Although research by Andrews, Bonta, and Hoge(1990) and Gendreau, Little, & Goggin (1996) find that personality is among the strongestpredictors of criminal behavior, the \"at risk\" personality attribute typically referred to involvesdimensions associated with antisocial ideation and psychopathy (Andrews & Bonta, 2003) ratherthan anxiety or neuroticism. Moreover, risk assessment instruments currently in use [e.g, SalientFactor Score (Hoffman & Beck, 1985), Level of Service Inventory-Revised (Andrews & Bonta,1995), and Wisconsin Risk Assessment System (Baird, Heinz & Bemus, 1979)] typically do notinclude measures of personality. Although there are good reasons for this, particularly againstincluding anxiety, evidence is accumulating that anxiety may be a risk factor as well as aresponsivity consideration. More importantly, it may be a risk factor that is exacerbated by the prevailing correctional treatment modalities. To be cautious, this assertion is based upon only one study, whereasanxiety's importance as a risk factor appears across several studies. Even so, the findingpertaining to the cognitive skills intervention is of particular concern (Van Voorhis et al., 2002).Unfortunately, we cannot determine precisely why neurotic offenders become more prone torecidivism following participation in the cognitive skills program. It is possible that a groupsetting is not appropriate for offenders with neurotic personalities. The pressure of performingskills in front of peers and coaches who routinely evaluate and provide feedback on the use ofthe skills may further exacerbate their anxiety. Perhaps these facilitators or group members weretoo confrontational. Consideration might be given to curricular modifications, which could helpsuch offenders to better deal with negative emotions and to develop skills for coping withanxiety-provoking situations. Perhaps these individuals would be better suited to angermanagement programming (e.g., see Goldstein & Glick, 1987) or to more clinical forms ofintervention, but the alternatives have not been researched in the context that we are addressing. Concerns might also be voiced for interventions that treat sex offenders as if they are all alike. It is not unusual, for example, for a sex offender program to target denial, empathy, and victimawareness. However, neurotic offenders often are not in denial and have capacity for empathy;they simply violate their own values. Again, programs that utilize a certain level of confrontationmay be detrimental to, or at least less effective, with neurotic child molesters. Winn (1996), forexample, notes that not all sex offenders respond well to confrontation. We may also need torevisit the issue of treating the self-esteem of these individuals. The correctional treatmentliterature abounds with warnings that self-esteem is not a risk factor and should not be the focusof offender therapy. However, to our knowledge, no studies attend to whether it might be a riskfactor for some types of offenders. To further complicate matters, describing these childmolesters as being introverted, insecure, and anxious yet possessing emotional empathy in noway suggests that they are \"lower risk\" offenders. Many of the neurotic child molesters in thisstudy had previous convictions (63 percent). More specifically, many of them had a previousconviction for a sex offense (48.1 percent). Thus, it must not have been unusual for this group to violate their own values, which, for the most part, were prosocial. Whatever the chosen alternatives, we are reminded poignantly of three assertions that emerged from the earliest research on neurotic offenders. First, they \"do not get better on their own; theydo need treatment\" (Warren, 1983). Second, their antisocial behavior is amplified by anxiety-provoking situations, including some types of staff confrontations intended to correct behavior(Warren et al., 1966; Palmer, 2002). Third, when matched to appropriate rather thaninappropriate interventions, they achieved more favorable results than other delinquents (Palmer,1974); when they were not treated for their anxiety, their failure rate was atypically high.Appropriate treatment goals for these offenders involved reduction or resolution of internalconflicts, comfort with one's own needs and feelings, reductions in the inappropriate use ofdefense mechanisms, appropriate disengagement from the dysfunctional family problems,increased sense of self worth and improved capacity for enjoyment (Warren, 1983). Arguably,such treatment goals have not seen the light of day for a long time in this field. back to top References | Endnotes * These types include: (a) Unsocialized aggressive (Aa on the original I-level system), characterized as negative toward authority and family, nonconforming, aggressive, with antisocial values and attitudes; (b) Unsocialized passive (AP), negative toward authority and family, negative self-concept, nonconforming, isolated, and low verbal aptitude; (c)Conformist (CFM), positive toward authority and family, conforming, dependent, uncritical self-concept; (d) Culturalconformist (CFC), low motivation, negative toward authority and family, distrustful, alienated, antisocial peers andattitudes; (e) Manipulator (MP), positive self-concept, manipulative, obtrusive; (f) Neurotic acting-out (NA), negative toauthority, conflicted life with family, defensive, cynical; (g) Neurotic Anxious (NX), conform, positive toward authority,anxious, and insecure; (h) Situational (SE), prosocial attitudes, positive self-concept, good interpersonal relationships; (i)Adaptive (CI), motivated, prosocial, good interpersonal relationships.

Wright, Ph.D. School of Education and Human Development State University of New York at Binghamton Introduction Capacity Purpose of Assessment Methodology Results Conclusions SEVERAL STATE AND federal correctional agencies have developed performance measurement systems. The success of these efforts led the Association of State CorrectionalAdministrators (ASCA) to initiate activities to develop a national outcome-based performancemeasurement system. ASCA identified measures that reflect the most crucial aspects ofcorrectional management, developed indicators to assess each measure, and specified which ofthe operational definitions for each indicator to allow for application across jurisdictions. ForASCA to continue, it must support the development of capacity within correctional agencies toparticipate in a national reporting system. This research assessed the current capacity of departments of corrections to participate in a national reporting system. A survey of departments found that almost all prison systems possessthe capacity to measure and report about the aggregate prisoner population under supervision andindividual characteristics of that population. Most prison agencies collect information aboutescapes, homicides and suicides. Beyond these measures, a significant disparity exists amongdepartments regarding their capacity to measure and report on all other indicators. To achieve its goal of advancing the commitment of adult institutional corrections to performance-based management, ASCA must invest in the appreciation for and commitment tothe philosophy and practice among correctional professionals. Performance measures assess the results achieved from activities performed within an organization. By routinely measuring performance, an agency can begin to chart its achievementin accomplishing desired outcomes. Such information can then be used to improve or enhanceservices, to evaluate management practices and to support continuous improvement.Performance-based management has become increasingly popular in prison administration overthe past decade. The Federal Bureau of Prisons led the way among correctional agencies inadopting performance-based management. The Bureau developed its Key Indicator and StrategicSupport System (KISSS) in which vital information about prisoners, staff, finances and healthservices was provided to central office and facility executives. States such as Florida, Minnesotaand North Carolina embraced performance-based management as part of statewide initiatives toimplement the practice across state agencies. What can be learned about the quality of performance through comparisons of an organization to itself over time is limited. When an organization can examine its practices against those of othersimilar organizations, it can begin to assess its approaches and managerial styles againstalternatives used elsewhere to determine what works best. Areas needing improvement and bestpractices can be identified. Enhanced possibilities for making decisions rationally and objectivelyare available with cross-organizational comparisons. Currently, sources of cross-jurisdictional information about prison performance are few. Two organizations compile information about prisons and prisoners from departments of correctionacross the nation. While it is not their primary purpose, the two sources provide someinformation about prison performance that can be used for cross-jurisdictional comparisons andanalysis. The Criminal Justice Institute, Inc., a for-profit consulting firm located in Middletown,Connecticut, produces the Corrections Yearbook annually. Data for the publication are suppliedby state and federal prison systems in response to a mailed questionnaire. CJI (2002) notes that itrelies upon its respondents for the accuracy and currency of the information it reports. Most ofthe data consist of statistics about numbers of prisoners and prisons; however, a few outcomeindicators of performance are presented in the Yearbook, including escapes, assaults, homicides and suicides. Interestingly, most outcome indicators are reported as frequencies rather than rates. Since some jurisdictions have larger numbers of prisoners than others, and thus a larger at-risk population,cross-jurisdictional comparisons are inappropriate. The number of incidents must be divided bynumber of prisoners to obtain a rate per individual; only then can the jurisdictional data becompared. Some interesting anomalies can be found in reviewing the frequency tables provided by CJI (2002). In the 2001 volume of the Corrections Yearbook , the Alaska prison system reported 44 escapes from secure facilities, Kentucky had 69 and Louisiana had 39. All other states and thefederal system had four or fewer escapes, with most having none (p. 33). Only two conclusionsseem possible from these data. Either Alaska, Kentucky and Louisiana are extremely lax inattending to security and protecting the public, or these three jurisdictions define \"escape\" verydifferently from all other jurisdictions. Similarly, in the same volume, Pennsylvania reported that only 16 assaults on staff were committed by its 36,000 prisoners during 2000; whereas, its neighbor to the west, Ohio, listed awhopping 467 assaults committed on staff by its slightly larger population of 45,000 prisoners.Once again, one is left with two options: either the Pennsylvania prison system is doing anextraordinary job of preventing attacks on staff in comparison to Ohio, or the two departmentsare counting assaults differently. The second source of information that can be used for some comparisons of cross-jurisdictional prison performance is the Bureau of Justice Statistics, an entity of the federal government locatedwithin the Department of Justice. Every few years, BJS conducts a national survey of individualsincarcerated in state and federal facilities. Since data collection in the BJS survey is not left toindividual jurisdictions but is conducted by trained interviewers supervised by agency staff, onecan be more confident of cross-jurisdictional comparability than with the CJI information.However, most of the BJS survey information concerns prisoners rather than prison performance.Only a few questions, such as whether an individual has been injured as the result of an attackby another prisoner, whether an individual self-identifying as having a mental health or drug andalcohol problem is receiving treatment, and whether the respondent is participating in a prisonprogram, can provide a basis for comparing outcomes across jurisdictions. Unlike the CorrectionsYearbook, where information is nicely summarized annually across jurisdictions, one would have to examine spreadsheets containing the data to assess how departments are doing using the BJSdata. Since these are the only significant and regularly collected cross-jurisdictional data, and giventheir limitations, the opportunity for comparing performance among prisons or prison systems is extremely limited. Yet, compelling reasons exist for seeking a cross-jurisdictional assessment of performance. One reason is to clear up confusion that arises from inappropriate comparisons. Allprison systems collect information about performance. Unfortunately, little uniformity exists indefining measures and collecting information. While comparisons among prison systems shouldnot be made, reporters, legislators and budget analysts regularly attempt to do so. This practicecan lead to erroneous conclusions. Second, while the control and punishment of criminalbehavior is clearly delegated to be a state function, this does not preclude the establishment of aset of clearly articulated values about what constitutes quality incarceration by correctionalprofessionals. National performance standards would establish objective norms against whichagencies could measure their performance. Third, the nation's prison systems vary considerablywith respect to practices, resources and management. A national performance measurementsystem would allow for cross-jurisdictional assessments of best and most efficient practices.Fourth, performance measurement recognizes good practice and identifies agencies that needimprovement. As such, a national reporting system would support quality improvement andencourage jurisdictions to consider how they should perform in the future. And, finally, theestablishment of a national system and the request that all state agencies participate wouldencourage jurisdictions to begin developing the infrastructure for performance- basedmanagement. Recognizing these needs, the Association of State Correctional Administrators (ASCA), the national professional organization of chief executive officers of the nation's prison systems, set asits highest priority the development of a national performance measurement system. ASCA'sinterest in performance measurement dates back to the mid-1990s, when it began to work withthe Urban Institute to determine the availability and use of common data elements amongdepartments of corrections. In a national survey of state and federal prison agencies, the UrbanInstitute found that jurisdictions varied considerably in the degree to which they collected variousdata elements and the extent to which those data were available electronically. Importantly,departments do not collect the information in exactly the same manner (Urban Institute, 1998:98). ASCA set about designing a national performance measurement system in August 1999, when its Executive Committee endorsed a resolution to create a subcommittee to develop measures thatcorrectional departments could use to track, compare and assess progress toward meetingidentified objectives. Over the next two years, that subcommittee worked to develop an initialperformance measurement model. The group identified eight standards of correctionalperformance that represent the most important elements of institutional correctional processes andselected four of those eight standards for further specification. The subcommittee then choseindicators for each of the four standards, each sufficiently detailed and comprehensive to capturethe crucial aspects of the over-reaching area of correctional performance. The final task indeveloping the performance measurement model was the specification of definitional rules formeasuring each indicator that would be sufficiently detailed to assure comparability acrossjurisdictions; that would account for important cross-jurisdictional differences in mission, legalstructures and organizational arrangements; and that would produce information applicable acrossjurisdictions. If jurisdictions follow these rules, then data will be reliable and valid. Theproblems noted above with the CJI data will be avoided. A total of 43 indicators for the four performance standards comprise the ASCA model. Because of the detail of the counting rules, the fully specified model is lengthy. (A copy can be obtainedfrom the ASCA headquarters.) Each indicator is expressed as a rate per population unit. Ratesare necessary so that outcomes can be compared across jurisdictions. If actual occurrences weresimply counted without converting them into rates, large states would generally show higherfrequencies than smaller agencies. I describe one indicator here to illustrate the specification contained in the measurement definitions. That measure is prisoner assaults on staff. Any one of several indicators could havebeen chosen for prisoner assaults on staff, but the subcommittee selected the following definition:Number of staff injured as a result of direct, willful and physical attacks by prisoners that required treatment by a medical professional during the calendar yearadjusted for the number of prisoners held by the agency on June 30 and reported asa rate per 1,000. Stock population on June 30 is used as a proxy for average daily population as it is an easiermeasure for prison systems to measure. For the numerator, one must consider whether all aggressive acts toward staff are to be counted or only those involving injury and weapons use. If the latter definition is used, what constitutes aweapon? Should the throwing of body fluids be included? What is an injury\u2014a cut or bruise ormore serious medical issues that require the attention of a health care professional? Who isincluded as a staff member\u2014any civilian in the facility, including volunteers, student interns,repair personnel representing a private vendor, contract workers, etc., or only paid employees ofthe department of corrections? Counting rules are specified to address these issues. The rulesselected for the numerator of prisoner-on-staff assaults are as follows: 1. A staff member is defined as an individual who is employed by the DOC or facility on afull-time, part-time, or contractual basis, and/or other individuals performing correctionalservices, e.g., volunteers or interns. Civilians who are attacked, but are not paid staffshould not be counted. These individuals might include visitors, truck drivers, servicepersonnel repairing equipment in the facility and construction workers employed bycontractors who have projects within the facility. 2. A single incident may have more than one victim; count the number of victims. 3. Count all injuries that require medical attention and treatment. 4. The fact that an assault has taken place does not have to be substantiated by thedisciplinary process; however, there must be sufficient evidence that the injury resultedfrom an attack and not an accident. 5. To be counted, the assailant must be incarcerated. 6. Do not include prisoners housed in other states or held in privately run facilities. 7. In the unified system, if the assailant is known, to be counted that individual must beconvicted of a crime and serving sentence greater than one year. The selection of these particular rules was somewhat arbitrary. For example, in the definition ofstaff, contract workers could have been included. What is important is that an agreed upon planfor data collection has been specified. If departments of correction collect information asspecified, then the outcome measures will be comparable across jurisdictions. With this model, ASCA now possesses the basic structure to proceed with the development of a national performance measurement system. For ASCA to continue its endeavor, it must engagein two additional tasks. The Association must acquire a data platform into which departmentscan begin to report performance data. Simultaneously, ASCA must support the development ofcapacity within correctional agencies to participate in a national reporting system. Developmentof capacity involves building the infrastructure that will allow for continuous performancemonitoring. back to top Capacity Historically, correctional agencies developed information systems to support operationalactivities. Early on, all information was maintained in paper files. With computerization, agencies began to capture some of the information contained in written records and automate it. For the most part, these data files were developed and designed to support operational decision-making, so they tended to be specific and functional. Most departments of corrections maintain several record systems, each associated with a specific functional area. Departments keep records on prisoners, including demographics, offense history,current offense, sentence, and perhaps, information about substance abuse, education, mentalhealth and so forth. Departments automate some but not all of this information. Agencies alsokeep information about significant events that occur in the day-to-day operations of prisons.When a significant event occurs\u2014an assault, for example\u2014staff members write a report orseries of reports describing the event. Many systems have designed forms for recording theinformation that is then automated. Departments of corrections also record information aboutstaff. These data are often maintained by human resources personnel and vary in the degree towhich they are automated. Prison medical units record information about the physical andmental health of prisoners as well as information about substance abuse and the treatment thatprisoners undergo. The most frequent use of prison records is in day-to-day decision making. Personnel considering transferring a prisoner may review his or her records to determine time served or time-remaining,program needs or history of disruptive behavior while incarcerated. Because different functionalareas are involved in creating and collecting information about prisoners, prisons' automatedinformation systems tend to draw from these different data sources to create an integrated datarecord for each prisoner. Another use of prison records is in report writing. Here, rather than focusing on an individual, assessments are conducted on aggregate populations. Prison administrators may be interested inthe number of prisoner-on-prisoner assaults that occur each month. A lawsuit could generate aneed to know the percentage of the prison population receiving some form of substance abusetreatment. Here, individual data must be scanned and aggregate patterns tallied. As an organization moves from operational- oriented management to strategic- and performance- based management, the need for information to support decision making increases. The same istrue if the agency decides to participate in a national performance indicator system. A departmentmust enhance its distinctive operational databases\u2014prisoner information, disciplinary records,personnel data, medical records, etc.\u2014to create integrated data systems that can be queried tosupport decision making. In particular, integrated systems that allow for performance monitoringmust be designed. The capacity of a department to participate in a national performance measurement system is directly linked to the development of its data systems. Departments that have integrated,performance-based information systems can begin to participate and report in a national systemrather quickly and with minimal staff time and expense. Departments that still employ operationaldatabases will find such participation more difficult. The ability to query databases and report onperformance is referred to as capacity . Capacity to participate in a national performance measurement system is determined by the data collected, the automation of those data, and theability to query the information to obtain measures of indicators of performance. back to top Purpose of Assessment The topics contained within the ASCA model represent performance issues that prison executives consider to be among the most important aspects of managing prisons well. For this reason, onewould expect most departments of correction to collect most of the information included in themodel. However, ASCA decided to pursue a national reporting system because different prisonsystems collect data in very dissimilar ways, using unique definitions and data collection rules.For that reason, cross-jurisdictional comparisons are inappropriate and not valid. The purpose of this assessment was to determine to what extent the Nation's departments of corrections are prepared to participate in a national performance measurement reporting program. In conducting this assessment, I used the ASCA model with its own unique set of definitions andcounting rules. However, I suspect that the findings would be the same whatever the model is. It was expected that most departments of correction would use some but not all the counting rules for most indicators. Some systems might also employ rules that were not specified in theASCA model. In other cases, agencies could measure an indicator completely different from theway it is specified as an ASCA indicator. For example, some state prison agencies use anincident-based measure of prisoner-on-prisoner assaults rather than definitions consisting ofnumbers of assailants and victims as selected by ASCA. After determining the extent to which an agency measures a particular indicator using the counting rules, the next concern was to determine what would be required to collect theinformation as it has been specified. It was expected that for some indicators, a department mightneed only to make minor changes that involve minimal staff time and expense. The informationnecessary to report rates as specified could already be collected, and staff would need only towrite computer code to capture and report the information as desired. In other cases, beginning tocollect the data could pose a major task for an agency requiring a policy change, considerableexpensive data collection, and the retraining of operational staff as to the value and utility of theinformation. Because any national reporting system that is eventually designed and implemented will require the input of automated data, the third topic examined in this assessment was the extent to whichinformation regarding each key indicator is automated. If the data are collected, but not availablein a machine-readable format, then the assessment needed to determine what was required toautomate the data for a prison agency. The assessment of prison agencies' capacity to participate in a national performance measurement system, thus, proceeded with three questions: 1. Does the department collect the information on a key indicator as specified by thedefinitions and counting rules? 2. If not, what would be involved in beginning to collect the information as defined andspecified? 3. Are the data automated? If not, what would be involved in automating the information? These three questions needed to be answered for each key indicator contained in ASCAperformance measures model. The following sections describe the methodology used for this taskand the findings of the assessment. back to top Methodology Procedure: Because of the level of detail necessary about how data are collected and which, if any, of the counting rules are applied in obtaining the information, written questionnaires were inadequate for this task. Rather, interviews were conducted with those intimately knowledgeableabout the separate departments' information systems. These interviews were conducted bytelephone by two researchers working with the ASCA Subcommittee. Respondents received a copy of the model via e-mail and were told that a member of the project team would contact them. During an initial e-mail and/or telephone contact, the assessment wasexplained, a time for an interview was scheduled, and respondents were told that they would beasked the three questions outlined above for each data element. At the time of the survey, 52 distinctive data elements comprised the model (several elements were revised based upon information obtained from the survey). Interviews generally lasted approximately one hour but ranged from 35 minutes to 2 hours. During the course of the telephone sessions, respondents were asked the three questions listed above for each of the 52data elements. The respondents' answers were recorded on data sheets. Sample. A census of all state prison systems and the federal prison system was initially thought to be necessary to determine capacity among the Nation's prison departments to participate in a performance measurement program. All ASCA members (with the exception of city and foreigndepartments of corrections) were contacted and asked to nominate an individual to participate inthe assessment. As nominations came in, nominated individuals were contacted to arrange aninterview. Because of the breadth of the ASCA model, some departments had representativesfrom different functional units present during the interviews. Respondents included research,information technology, and/or planning staff. After 17 interviews were completed, response patterns were being repeated by new interviewees with little new information about capacity being obtained. The subcommittee decided that datafrom all jurisdictions were not required. The group, however, saw value in including a fewadditional states in specific geographic locations and with specific characteristics to assure thatthose surveyed represented the array of departments across the nation. Personnel from sevenadditional agencies were interviewed, resulting in a total sample of 24 departments. Analyses. The interviews produced a wealth of rich detail regarding prison systems' data collection practices and information technology systems. Two techniques were employed to synthesize this information to gain an overall perspective of capacity. First, a coding system wasdeveloped to summarize response patterns. For each data element, respondents' answers wereclassified into four categories: 1) collecting as specified, 2) collecting but recoding needed, 3)collecting but not automated, and 4) not collecting. The individual who conducted the interviewassigned the data elements into one of the four categories. To ensure reliability of these data, theclassifications were emailed back to respondents, and they were asked to confirm that therepresentation was accurate. The second set of analyses involved qualitative assessments. The two people who conducted the telephone interviews reviewed field notes looking for patterns as to the ability of departments toprovide the desired performance information. Each reviewer worked independently and then thetwo compared their assessments to assess and enhance reliability of their evaluations. back to top Results Quantitative Assessment. The summary results of the telephone surveys are provided in Table 1 . By scanning the first column of results, Collecting as Specified, one can determine to what extent the Nation's departments of corrections are currently prepared to participate in a nationalreporting system if it were implemented today. Recall that all key indicators have both anumerator and denominator. The numerator contains substantive information about the topicalarea of the indicator (e.g., number of escapes from secure facilities), and the denominatorincludes information that adjusts for population size (e.g., number of prisoners held in securefacilities). A quick scan of the \"Collecting as Specified\" column reveals that agencies arecollecting data about the denominators (i.e., information about the prisoner population). Still,even here, 20 percent of the departments, could not provide information about basiccharacteristics of their prisoner populations. Regarding the numerators, the actual substantive information of interest, the findings are far less encouraging. For a few indicators, almost half the departments are collecting information asspecified (i.e., 46 percent for escapes from within secure facilities and 38 percent for prisoner-on-staff homicides). But, for many other indicators, the percentage of departments collecting theinformation as specified is extremely low. Only 17 percent of the departments currently use thesame definition of prisoner-on-prisoner attacks as the ASCA model. Only 8 percent of thesystems can report, as specified, when a prisoner has sexually attacked a staff member. Likewise, only 8 percent can report major disturbances that occur each year as it has been defined. Reviewing the percentages of departments that can provide information regarding the various key indicators provides a partial explanation of capacity. One also needs to examine how manydepartments cannot provide information as specified. The last two columns, Collecting NotAutomated and Not Collecting, identify departments that will require substantial time and effortto begin measuring performance as it is defined by the ASCA model. By adding the percentageof the two columns together, one obtains an indication of how many departments will requireconsiderable effort to begin reporting. For the first standard, Public Safety, about 20 to 25 percent of the prison systems have no automated information on the key indicators or are not collecting the information currently. Forexample, 21 percent of the agencies fall into these categories for escapes from within securefacilities, 25 percent for escapes from outside secure facilities and 21 percent for returns toprison for a new conviction. However, the second standard\u2014Institutional Safety\u2014is where one observes considerable under- capacity to participate in a reporting system. Approximately half of the departments lackautomated data or do not collect information about: 1. Victims of Prisoner-on-Prisoner Assaults, 2. Prisoner-on-Staff Assaults, 3. Prisoner-on-Prisoner Sexual Assaults, 4. Prisoner-on-Staff Sexual Assaults, 5. Staff Sexual Misconduct, 6. Staff Homicides, and 7. Disturbances. Few departments collect and automate information about the number of hours of substance abuseand mental health treatment and assessment provided by staff as originally specified in StandardIII. As noted above, this finding was one of the motivating factors behind the development ofnew indicators for this standard. A noticeably different situation regarding departments' capacity emerges when reviewing the last two columns of Table 1 for Contextual Information. Only one department reported that it does not collect these data currently. The final column of Table 1 includes departments that are collecting the information outlined in the key indicator, but would require additional computer programming to report the information as specified. Approximately one third of the departments fall into this category. In some cases,the recoding effort would involve minimal staff time and effort and could be easilyaccomplished, while in other cases, substantial work would be required for a state to begin toprovide the information as specified. Qualitative Assessments. A distinction can be made between departments with and without integrated, performance-based systems. This survey of correctional departments' abilities to reportkey indicators found that integrated systems are able to begin participating in a national reportingsystem relatively quickly and easily. Since the ASCA model identifies what correctionalexecutive administrators view as the most important elements of prison practice, departmentswith their own performance measurement models generally include the same standards andindicators. There may be definitional differences between the ASCA model and the departments'models, but because these agencies have developed integrated information systems, only minormodifications will be needed to measure the indicators as specified. Based upon the interviewsconducted in this assessment, it appears that about 20 to 25 percent of the departments haveintegrated, performance-based information systems. For the remaining departments, whose information systems were not fully integrated,participation in a reporting system varies across the indicators. Most systems have relatively well-developed databases for prisoner records. Consequently, they can provide information about the denominators of the key indicators\u2014prisoner population on a particular day, segments of theprisoner population on a particular day (i.e., male prisoners, female prisoners), and prisonerpopulation housed in secure facilities on a particular day. Departments can also provideinformation about the characteristics of the prisoner population, or the information detailed inthe contextual information key indicators. To \"level the playing field\" across correctional systems, the counting rules specify that unified systems, departments that house non-convicted individuals and misdemeanants, should onlyinclude data for felons serving one year or longer. (Non-unified systems should include data onall convicted felons.) Many of the unified systems report that segmenting the populationaccording to this criterion would be complicated and problematic. Many offenders have multipleand complex sentences that make such computation extremely difficult if not impossible.Consequently, many unified systems are not able to provide data even for the prisoner populationand characteristics indicators. Departments with non-integrated data systems face the greatest difficulty with the substantive areas specified in Standards II and III, institutional safety and substance abuse and mental health.Almost all departments keep track of the numbers of prisoner and staff homicides, prisonersuicides and results of drug testing. Beyond these measures, departments with non-integrated datasystems will struggle. Most departments maintain incident-based records of significant events.These databases cannot be queried to produce information as it has been specified regardingprisoner-on-prisoner and prisoner-on-staff assaults, sexual assaults, or disturbances. Theirautomated records lack the necessary detail to respond to the definitions and counting rules ofthe ASCA key indicators. Beginning to collect and record the information would require mostdepartments to make significant modifications in how they take information from incidentreports. Data collection instruments and/or computer screens would need to be redesigned.Operational staff would have to be trained to record the new information. And, databases wouldhave to be reformed to include new information fields. For most departments, these changeswould be substantial. Any of the indicators involving information about staff\u2014prisoner-on-staff assaults, sexual assaults of staff and staff sexual misconduct\u2014would also pose a significant challenge for mostdepartments. Among the departments with operational data systems, staff records tend to bemaintained by human resources. The information is not available in a form that allows for thespecifications regarding staff victimization and behavior in the ASCA model. A department maybe able to determine from its prisoner records that a staff member was victimized, but often willnot be able to identify the gender of the staff member. As described in the quantitative section above, the original indicators developed for the substance abuse and mental health standard proved problematic and were re-specified. Even withthe changes, information regarding substance abuse and mental health treatment tends to berecorded and maintained by the health services unit of the department of corrections. Fewdepartments have automated this information. Furthermore, health records currently used wouldbe extremely difficult to automate as information is kept in traditional hospital-type files(jackets). Most departments would have to design a completely new record-keeping system toproduce the information outlined in the ASCA model. back to top Conclusions This survey found that almost all prison systems possess the capacity to measure and report on the aggregate prisoner population under supervision and individual characteristics of thatpopulation. Most prison agencies collect information on escapes, homicides and suicides. Beyondthese measures, a significant disparity exists among departments regarding their capacity tomeasure and report on all other indicators.Departments can be divided into two general groups. Approximately 20 to 25 percent of the Nation's prison agencies have strategic management systems that combine traditional operationaldatabases to create integrated information systems to monitor performance. These departmentsare positioned to begin participating fully in a national reporting system. They may need to makeminor changes in how information is collected and retrieved, as well as writing new computercode to compile information exactly as it is specified by the key indicators and their countingrules. The one exception to the above conclusion is in the area of substance abuse and mental health measurement. Because the records are collected by health units of prison systems, even theintegrated information systems often lack detailed information to respond to the ASCA indicatorsin this area. The remaining 75 to 80 percent of the Nation's departments of corrections, beyond the measures identified above, have more limited capacity to measure and report on the remaining ASCA keyindicators. Automated disciplinary records are incident-based and lack detail about weaponsused, injuries sustained, and victims. Agencies are unable to co-mingle staff data with prisonerinformation. Departments simply do not record information about disturbances in the detailnecessary to count and report incidents as specified. To a large extent, the reason for the lack ofcapacity is that departments still maintain separate operational databases. For some systems, theonly prisoner records are automated; disciplinary, staff and medical records are not automated. Respondents had an interesting reaction to the survey. Even though they were told that the study was intended to assess capacity to report on the ASCA indicators, many were concerned thatthey would have to begin reporting in the near future. They were trying to figure out how theycould produce the information. This response could pose a potential problem in how data areproduced. If departments simply pass responsibility off to middle-level central office staff, theylikely will approach the task of data production as a discrete problem to be solved, whereasASCA's goal is to advance performance-based management. Furthermore, a discrete problemorientation may not produce information about the key indicators that is reliable, valid andadheres to the definitions and counting rules specified. If this were to occur, the newperformance monitoring system would suffer the exact same problems as exist with theCorrections Yearbook . Capacity development involves more than convincing directors to participate in a nationalperformance measurement system. Strategic management includes analyzing current conditionswithin the organization and its environment, evaluating alternative courses of action, devisingstrategies for performance improvement, taking risks, being creative and sustaining a continuousprocess that accumulates experience and redirects practice and decision making in light of futuregoals. Development of the agency's capacity to utilize a performance measurement system willbe an important part of transforming an organization from a rule-based to a results-basedmanagement practice. The change from an operations-oriented to a strategic-orientedorganization is a lengthy, expensive and staff-intensive effort. If ASCA's goal is to advance the commitment of adult institutional corrections to performance- based management, it must invest in the appreciation for and commitment to the philosophy andpractice. This is much broader than a willingness to participate in a particular reporting system.Directors in general and particularly new directors can be introduced to the topic at ASCAmeetings. However, significant advancement will only occur if experienced correctionalexecutives who have led their agencies through such transformations assist officials from otheragencies considering and willing to undertake such change. As an agency undertakes performance-based management, it will necessarily need to integrate its operational information systems and to create a management information system. Most prisonerrecord systems tend to be adequate, but considerable development work is needed in other areas.Critical incident databases need to be enhanced to include more detail about the perpetrators,victims, weapons, and injuries sustained. Disciplinary information, often not contained in a database, must be coded and linked back to significant events. Staff data must be linked toprisoner data. And finally, health records across systems must be evolved into performance- measures databases. Substantial investments in hardware and software are required to accomplish these tasks. Obtaining or reallocating state resources for these investments may be difficult forsome agencies given the current revenue problems faced by most states. Thus, alternate sourcesof funds are essential. Equally important is the training of staff at all levels within theorganization to use performance data and analysis for decision-making. Considerable planning isrequired if this action is to be successful. Once an agency is able to produce performance data that are used internally to improve correctional practice, then it is ready to begin participating in a national reporting performancemeasurement system. back to top References The articles and reviews that appear in Federal Probation express the points of view of the persons who wrote them and not necessarily the points of view of the agencies and organizations with which these persons are affiliated.

Wilcoxen, U. S. Pretrial Services Officer Assistant, District of Nebraska Introduction Methods Results Discussion Limitations of this Study Recommendations THE PURPOSE OF this survey study was to examine customers' attitudes toward the services provided by the United States Pretrial Services Office for the District of Nebraska. This officewas established as a separate agency from the U.S. Probation Office in July 1992. Its primarymission is to \"preserve the presumption of innocence, while ensuring the protection of thecommunity\" (Connor, 2000). The services provided by U.S. Pretrial Services are diverse and itsmission is to serve multiple customers, including judges, U.S. Marshals, United States anddefense attorneys, U.S. Probation, alcohol and drug treatment staff, and defendants. Although theagency has existed for eight years, this was the first time clients' satisfaction and quality ofservices were formally assessed. An extensive review of the literature indicated that assessment of client satisfaction with U.S. Pretrial Services agencies had either not been formally conducted, or not been published. Thisstudy contributes to the existing literature by addressing that deficiency. It is unique for severalreasons. First, it provides a model for formal survey assessment of quality of services and clientsatisfaction that does not currently exist. Second, it assesses multiple clients' attitudes toward theservices provided by U.S. Pretrial Services. Seven separate surveys were developed to assess thetypes of services provided to each client group. Third, an independent research consultant wasused to administer the surveys and analyze the results. To ensure respondent anonymity, U.S.Pretrial Services staff did not have access to the raw data. This study should benefit not only to the U.S. Pretrial Services Office in the District of Nebraska but other agencies interested in assessing quality of services and client satisfaction. In addition,the Federal Judicial Center may use the findings of this study to target training needs within theU.S. Courts. back to top MethodsThe research method used to conduct this study was a cross-sectional, descriptive survey. Survey methodology was particularly appropriate for this study because of its focus on assessing clients' attitudes about the services provided by the U.S. Pretrial Services office. It provided anopportunity for clients to assess the quality of U.S. Pretrial Services anonymously. The sample for this study was seven customer groups served by the Lincoln and Omaha U.S. Pretrial Services offices, including judges, defense attorneys, U.S. attorneys, U.S. marshals, U.S.probation officers, drug and alcohol treatment center staff, and past and current defendants.Multiple sampling strategies were used to identify potential respondents. Census sampling wasused to select judges, U.S. attorneys, U.S. marshals, and U.S. probation officers. All individualsin these groups were surveyed because of the small number in each of these four client groups.Since the population of defense attorneys was larger, they were selected using systematicrandom sampling so the number of participants equaled the number of prosecuting attorneys.Treatment staff were selected purposefully, by identifying staff members who regularly workedwith U.S. Pretrial Services staff and could most accurately assess the services provided by theU.S. Pretrial Services office. The sampling frames used for these six client groups were currentrosters maintained by the U.S. Pretrial Services office. Defendants were selected usingsystematic random sampling from a list of individuals who had worked with U.S. PretrialServices staff in the last three years. The sampling frame used to identify defendants was thePACTS database system (Probation Pretrial Services Automated Case Tracking System). Theoriginal sample size for all seven client groups was 254; however, due to the difficulty inobtaining current addresses for defendants, 44 surveys were returned \"undeliverable.\" Thisreduced the total sample size to 210. Of those 210, 125 usable surveys were returned for a 59.5percent response rate. Table 1 identifies the number of surveys mailed and responses by client group. Seven separate surveys were designed to rate the services provided by the U.S. Pretrial Services office specific to each client group. The survey items were designed by U.S. Pretrial Servicesstaff, with the assistance of an independent research consultant. The surveys had between 18 and28 items. Surveys for all seven client groups had five common demographic questions. Therewere also nine common items on all seven client group surveys. Surveys for each of the sevenclient groups were specifically tailored to assess the types of services provided to each group.The surveys had between four and fourteen items specific to each client group. The most common response set on the surveys was a five-point Likert scale ( strongly agree , agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, strongly disagree ). In some cases, respondents were asked to rate the quality of services using a different scale ( excellent, good, average, below average, poor ) or assess a \"report card\" grade for the services provided by the U.S. Pretrial Services office (A-F).The surveys were mailed to respondents on August 13, 1999. A cover letter from the research consultant prefaced the survey, explaining the importance of the study, the need for respondents'assistance, confidentiality issues, and the logistics of filling out and returning the survey. Thesurveys were mailed by the research consultant and returned to the research consultant. Theresponse rate for the first mailing was 34.8 percent. A second survey and revised cover letter wasmailed to non-respondents on September 3, 1999. The total response rate after two mailings was59.5 percent. Data were analyzed using basic, descriptive statistics, including frequencies, percentages, measures of central tendency (mean score) and measures of variability (standard deviation). Datawere analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software. Anindependent consultant analyzed the data within client groups and across client groups. back to top Results Common ItemsNine common items were assessed by all seven customer groups. The items assessed basic services provided by U.S. Pretrial Services and customers' overall satisfaction with the agency. The item that was rated highest was staff professionalism (mean = 1.55) and the item that wasrated lowest was objectivity with defendants (mean = 2.14). Seven of the items used a 5-pointLikert scale ( SA=Strongly Agree, A=Agree, NAD=Neither Agree nor Disagree, D=Disagree, SD=Strongly Disagree ). Table 2 reports the results for these seven items. Respondents were asked to rate the overall quality of services provided by the U.S. PretrialServices Office using the following scale: Excellent, Good, Average, Below Average, Poor. Forty-six of the respondents (37 percent) rated the services excellent, fifty-one (41 percent) rated the services good, eleven (9 percent) rated the services average, five (4 percent) rated the services below average, and eleven (9 percent) rated the services poor. Respondents were also asked to assess a letter grade for the services provided ( A=excellent, B=good, C=average, D=below average, F=poor). Three quarters of the respondents awarded U.S. Pretrial Services a grade of either A/excellent (58/46 percent) or B/good (36/29 percent). Eleven respondents (9 percent) awarded a C/average, six (5 percent) awarded a D/below average, and nine (7 percent) awarded an F/poor . Common Items by Individual Client Groups The data for each specific client group were examined on the nine common items on every survey. The results indicated that overall, clients strongly agreed or agreed with the items andthere was little variability across responses. However, of the seven client groups, defenseattorneys' responses were slightly less positive than others with the exception of defendants.Defendants responses were consistently lower than the responses of those in the other six clientgroups, and there was greater variability across defendants' responses. Table 3 identifies the mean score and the standard deviation for the seven common items based on client group. The overall quality of Pretrial Services was rated the highest by the Judges ( excellent, 1.22/0.44) and the lowest by the defendants ( average, 2.95/1.48). The other groups rated the agency's overall quality as good. The report card grades assigned by the customer groups were consistent with their overall quality ratings. Judges assigned an A (1.11/0.33), defendants assigned a C (2.86/1.44) and the remaining groups assigned B's.Items Tailored to Individual GroupsJudges. Ten items were specifically tailored to assess judges' attitudes about their work with Pretrial Services. Judges' responses to the survey items specifically tailored to them were overall positive. One hundred percent of the judges strongly agreed that U.S. Pretrial Services staff wereresponsive to the courts (mean=1.00) and respectful (mean-1.00). Judges identified room forimprovement in Pretrial Services officers' timeliness (mean=1.67) as well as thoroughness(mean-1.44) in reporting to the courts. U.S. Attorneys. U.S. Attorneys responded to six items specifically tailored to their work with Pretrial Services. U.S. Attorneys strongly agreed that Pretrial Services staff were respectful (mean=1.16). The U.S. Attorneys agreed with the other five items tailored to them. The U.S. Attorneys indicated that pretrial services officers maintained a neutral position (mean=1.72), Defense Attorneys. Defense attorneys were also asked to assess six items individually tailored to their work with U.S. Pretrial Services officers. Defense attorneys' responses to survey items thathad to do with procedure, professionalism and quality of work were generally positive. The mosthighly rated item was that Pretrial Services Officers were respectful (mean=1.50). DefenseAttorneys were neutral regarding whether Pretrial Services officers made appropriate referrals(mean=2.83) and whether the officers maintained a neutral position with clients (mean=2.83). U.S. Probation. U.S. Probation staff responded to four items specifically tailored to their group. The most positive rating was on cooperation in sharing information (mean=1.00) and the lowest rating was on Pretrial Services' promptness in responding to their requests (mean=1.75). U.S. Marshals . Four survey items were specifically tailored to U.S. Marshals. U.S. Marshals strongly agreed (mean=1.42) that U.S. Pretrial Services staff were respectful. They agreed that U.S. Pretrial Services maintained current demographic information (mean=1.67), that they were timely in sharing information (mean=2.00) and that U.S. Pretrial Services staff were considerateof defendants (mean=2.00). Drug and Alcohol Treatment Staff. Eight survey items were individually tailored to Drug and Alcohol Treatment Staff. At least two thirds of the drug/alcohol treatment staff strongly agreed or agreed with all of the survey items tailored to their work with Pretrial Services' work with treatment agencies. All respondents agreed or strongly agreed that Pretrial Services staff was respectful. On all other individually tailored survey items, drug and alcohol treatment staffneither agreed nor disagreed . Defendants. Defendants responded to eight survey items tailored to their group. Defendants agreed that they were treated with dignity (mean=2.38). This was the item they rated the most positively. The mean scores indicated that the defendants were neutral ( neither agreed nor disagreed ) with the other seven items, including being treated fairly (mean=2.71), Pretrial Services providing accurate information (mean=2.62), and being treated as an individual(mean=2.88). Defendant responses to survey items were more varied than the responses from the other participant groups. The standard deviation on these eight items ranged from 1.08 to 1.47. Ingeneral, more than half of the respondents were positive about the services provided by U.S.Pretrial Services, 14 percent to 17 percent were neutral, and approximately 30 percent werenegative. back to top Discussion Overwhelmingly, respondents perceived that U.S. Pretrial Services staff conducted themselves in a professional manner. This item had the highest mean score of the seven items assessed by allseven client groups (mean score=1.55). This item also had the smallest standard deviation (0.81),which means there was less variability across responses than on the other six items. The datasuggest that professionalism is demonstrated by Pretrial Services staff in their attire, conductunder pressure, and interactions with other professionals as well as defendants. The agency chief's emphasis on professionalism may contribute to this result. The chief 's emphasis includesdiscussions on professionalism and a written policy pertaining to appropriate office attire with anemphasis on projecting a professional image. Defendants, though their scores were lower overall than those of the other client groups, were positive on items that seem to generally reflect the professional attitudes and decorum of theagency. More than half strongly agreed or agreed they were \"treated fairly,\" were \"treated with dignity,\" received \"accurate information,\" received a \"clear explanation of the function of PretrialServices,\" and were \"treated like an individual.\" Defendants were much less positive about items that could have been related to the entire federal case experience and its outcome. Those items include the defendants' attitudes about beingtreated as \"innocent until proven guilty,\" and feeling that Pretrial Services \"helped (them) find abalance between case-related demands and life demands.\" Fewer than half of the responses toeach of those items were rated positively ( strongly agree or agree ). Several defendants' comments reflected confusion about U.S. Pretrial Services, as they indicated they thought theU.S. Pretrial Services officer had written the pre-sentence investigation and made a sentencingrecommendation, which is a role of a U.S. probation officer. Negative defendant responses couldbe based on several factors, including highly structured and restrictive release conditions and/orviolation proceedings, lack of understanding of Pretrial Services' role in the case versus U.S.Probation's, and/or the Pretrial Services' officer's failure to provide the assistance the defendantneeded. Defense attorneys were consistent in their assessment of both the overall quality of the U.S. Pretrial Services office ( good) and a report card grade ( B). Both items had mean scores of 1.83. The three items the defense attorneys rated the lowest were the appropriateness of U.S. PretrialServices' recommendations (mean=2.67), their objectivity with defendants (mean=2.67), and theappropriateness of referrals (mean=2.17). Interestingly, these were the same three items ratedlowest by U.S. attorneys. Although defense attorneys rated those items lower than U.S. attorneysdid, this is a general indication that defense attorneys view Pretrial Services' orientation as toorestrictive and U.S. attorneys view the agency as not restrictive enough. The mean scoresindicated that defense attorneys had a slightly more positive overall perception of the U.S.Pretrial Services office than did U.S. attorneys. Although the mid-point \"neutral\" was alegitimate response, U.S. attorneys may have also chosen neutral responses because they did nothave direct observation of, or exposure to, referrals or interactions between U.S. Pretrial Servicesand defendants. A \"not observed\" or \"not applicable\" option on the survey might have provideda more accurate rating. Selecting the neutral responses lowered the mean score on those items. Ratings by judges and U.S. attorneys indicated a need for improvement in the timeliness of reporting violations. Timeliness in reporting violations can be affected by the officer's delay inreporting to the judge until he or she receives verification that a violation has occurred (e.g.,obtaining citation copies, accessing drug testing forms to be cross referenced with laboratoryreports). The agency may want to consider using email to report \"apparent violations\" and thestatus of the officer's verification efforts. Communication was another issue that was assessed. On three of the four survey items for the U.S. Marshal Service, there were a few responses that were neither agree or disagree . Those three survey items assessed whether U.S. Pretrial Services maintained current demographicinformation, were timely in sharing information, and were considerate of the demands on theU.S. Marshal Service. One respondent disagreed that U.S. Pretrial Services shared timely information and one disagreed that U.S. Pretrial Services was considerate of the demands on the U.S. Marshal Service. Both items address communication between the two agencies. Whiletreatment staff responses were positive overall, it appears that the issue they also most stronglybelieved needed to be addressed was Pretrial Services' inter-agency communication. Overall, respondents of all groups agreed (mean score 2.14) that U.S. Pretrial Services staff treated defendants objectively. Interestingly, this item had the second smallest standard deviation of all the common items (0.98), indicating less variability on this item than on most items. Onemight have assumed there would be greater variability, especially between respondents who fitinto professional groups versus defendants, but that was not the case. Neutral to negative responses from all client groups regarding timely assistance may reflect the low number of staff employed relative to the caseload size in this district. At the time this surveywas conducted, U.S. Pretrial Services staff was composed of five officers, two support staff andtwo interns/contractors for a caseload of 563. The numbers of cases require all Pretrial Servicesstaff to have more obligations (e. g., attending court hearings, conducting investigations) outsidethe office. At times, the office may not have been staffed because all staff members wereinvolved with obligations outside the office. back to top Limitations of this Study Several potential limitations may have influenced this study. It was difficult to locate the current addresses of the defendants. The highest rate of \"undeliverable\" surveys were returned becausedefendants were no longer incarcerated or no longer at their last known address. The researcherscompensated for this by over-sampling defendants. The survey was directed only to English-speaking defendants. The names of non-English speaking defendants were removed from the sampling frame, because of their inability torespond to a survey in English.Those respondents who were selected randomly (i.e., defense attorneys and defendants) most likely had varying degrees of interaction with U.S. Pretrial Services. Though the researchers triedto compensate for this by developing seven different surveys, tailoring each survey to thespecific client group, some respondents may have had less exposure to the U.S. Pretrial office'sservices than others in the same client group. The survey used Likert-scale items but did not have a response option for \"not applicable\" or \"not observed.\" In some cases the responses may have been skewed because respondents mayhave used the midpoint on the scale (neither agree nor disagree) when an item was not applicableor observed. This would have lowered the overall rating on the items where this occurred. back to top Recommendations Based on the results of this study, several recommendations are offered for the target audiences of the study. For U.S. Pretrial Services-District of Nebraska 1. Develop a mechanism to better educate client groups (especially defendants and treatment providers) about the role of the U.S. Pretrial Services Office, relative to the status of thecase and the judicial process. Pamphlets, written in English and Spanish, would be themost economical educational tool; however, a video would also be effective. 2. Address the issue of communication with Spanish-speaking individuals. A limitation ofthe study was that only English-speaking people were surveyed. 3. Pretrial Services staff need to make in-person community contacts with treatment centersregularly. 4. Pretrial Services staff should participate in ongoing training on current developments ofaddiction/treatment issues to aid in supervision. For Pretrial Services Officers 1 . Officers should regularly consult with other officers about client cases to ensureobjectivity and exploration of all available options for supervision and recommendations. 2. Pretrial Services officers should also communicate, with regularity, with drug and alcoholtreatment staff about clients' participation and progress as well as court developments anddrug testing results. For the Federal Judicial Center 1 . Continue to emphasize a key training issue, specifically the language barriers that someU.S. Pretrial Services officers face in interacting with Spanish-speaking defendants. TheCenter could assist officers by offering programs such as interactive computer trainingprogram(s) or providing lists of recommended programs or training to officers. 2. Support the creation of an educational mechanism for defendants to assist with theirunderstanding the role of Pretrial Services' within the judicial process. Recommendations for Future Research This was an exploratory study designed to assess customer satisfaction with the U.S. Pretrial Services, District of Nebraska. This study could be expanded in several ways, based on thefollowing recommendations:1. Extend this survey to additional client groups who work with U.S. Pretrial Services, including courtroom deputies and U.S. Marshals' support staff. 2. This type of customer satisfaction survey required a significant time commitment, particularly for analysis and formal composition of the entire assessment tool with results.Agencies considering conducting a similar customer satisfaction assessment shoulddesignate staff assigned to the project and designate blocks of time, such as a week at atime, during which those staff members are considered \"unavailable\" for routine officework to focus on the assessment. Alternatively, agencies should consider hiring anindependent research consultant to not only conduct the survey and analyze the data, butalso to compile the written report. This alternative will require a significant monetaryinvestment. 3. The U.S. Pretrial Services Office should design customer satisfaction tools that wouldenable the officers to collect data from non-English speaking and uneducated clients. 4. A broader geographical study of U.S. Pretrial Services across the country would provide agood comparative data base to see how U.S. Pretrial Services offices are perceivedthroughout the country, and whether there are differences by region. This could haveimplications for national training and policy. back to top References The articles and reviews that appear in Federal Probation express the points of view of the persons who wrote them and not necessarily the points of view of the agencies and organizations with which these persons are affiliated.

COHN, D.CRIM President, National Juvenile Court Services Association Treatment Gap According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health's household survey, 7.7 million people in the U.S. needed treatment for diagnosable drug problems in 2002, and 18.6 millionneeded treatment for a serious alcohol problem. Only 1.4 percent received specialized substanceabuse treatment and 1.5 percent of the 18.6 million of those with alcohol problems received it.According to the new findings, 362,000 people in 2002 recognized they needed treatment fordrug abuse. Of those, 88,000 tried but were unable to obtain treatment. The survey found thatmarijuana is the most popular illicit drug, used by 14.6 million people. Teens and Multiple ChoicesA survey reveals that most teens would rather spend time with family members than visit with friends, play sports, watch TV, or surf the Web. The annual State of Our Nation's Youth reports that teens admire their parents and tend to get along nicely with them. Asked how they get alongwith their parents or guardians, 74 percent of all teens (ages 13 to 19) say \"extremely well\" or\"very well.\" Only three percent say they don't get along. As many as 44 percent of the teens calla family member their role model. Among other findings: 37 percent of high school students say their mother is the role model. 30 percent of teens say the father is the role model. 76 percent of teens say they would like to learn more about world events and othercultures, up from 66 percent last year. 42 percent of high school students call pressure to get good grades a \"major problem,\" upfrom 35 percent last year. 80 percent say they plan to go to a four-year college, up from 66 percent last year. U.S. Prison Population The nation's prison population increased to 2,166,260 last year, a 2.6 percent increase, which is the largest increase since 1999, according to the Department of Justice. The rise came despite asmall decline in serious crime in 2002. It also came when a growing number of states havebegun to reduce prison costs by easing tough sentencing laws, thereby decreasing the number ofinmates. California had the largest number of inmates, with 162,317, followed by Texas, with162,003. Louisiana had the highest rate of incarceration, with 794 inmates per 100,000 residents,with Maine and Minnesota tied for the lowest incarceration rate, with 141 inmates per 100,000state residents. Life ExpectancyAmericans are living longer, becoming more health-conscious, and yet more chronically ill at the same time, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Overall life expectancy in 2001 was 77.2 years, an increase of almost four months from 2000, when it was 76.9 years. In 1900, anewborn could expect to live 47.3 years, while in 1950, life expectancy was 68.2 years. In 2001,77 percent of children younger than three were vaccinated. For children in poor families, thenumber was 72 percent. The percentage of high school students who reported they had smokedcigarettes in the last month fell to 29 percent in 2001; in 1997, it was 36 percent. The birthratefor teenage girls was 45 births per 1,000 girls, the lowest rate in more than 60 years. Thepercentage of children classified as overweight increased from seven percent in the late 1970s to15 percent in the 1990s. The full report can be obtained at www.cdc.gov/nchs/ . Roots of Stable Adults Children given extra attention by teachers and fed a nutritious diet appear to be at lower risk of becoming psychotic or developing conduct problems 20 years later, reports the American Journal of Psychiatry. The study examined the effects of improved teaching, exercise, and nutrition on100 children between the ages of three and five in Mauritius, an island nation in the IndianOcean. The group fed hot meals, made to exercise for over two hours daily, and given intensiveearly education had 31.9 percent fewer cases of psychosis at age 17 than those who received nospecial treatment. Those who got the intervention also had a 27.9 percent reduction in conductdisorder at age 17. The crime rate at age 23 was 13 percentage points lower in the enrichedgroup, and the risk that the young adults would become loners was cut by almost a third.

Probation and Parole in the U.S.\u20142002 The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) reports on the number of persons on probation and parole, by state, at year-end 2002 and compares the totals with year-end 1995 and 2000. The reportidentifies totals by state in terms of smallest and largest increases/decreases, the race and genderof the offenders, and reports the numbers of probationers and parolees completing communitysupervision successfully, or failing because of rule violations or new offenses. The adultprobation population grew 1.6 percent in 2002, an increase of 63,434 probationers, about half theaverage annual growth of 3.1 percent since 1995. Overall, the nation's parole population grew by20,808 in 2002, or 2.8 percent, almost double the average annual growth of 1.5 percent since1995. The nation's correctional population reached a record of more than 6.7 million adult men and women by the end of 2002. As of last December 31, about 3.1 percent of the U.S. adultpopulation, or one of every 32 adults, were in prisons or jails or in the community undercorrectional supervision, compared to 2.7 percent of the adult population in 1995. The full reportcan be obtained at http://www. ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/ppus02.htm . Student-Teacher Ratio According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the average number of public and private school students per teacher in the U.S. elementary and secondary schools has dropped: 1971 = 22.4 1981 = 18.7 1991 = 17.0 2001 = 15.8 (estimated) Teachers and Class TimeTeachers see fewer students per day than 40 years ago, have more prep time, but have lost 12 minutes at lunchtime. The National Education Association reports on the 2000-2001 school year that most elementary school teachers have 21 students per class, down from 29 in 1961. Teachersin secondary schools have 28 students per class, up from 27, but teach fewer a day. High schoolteachers in 1966 taught 132 students a day; by 2001 that was down to 89. The average teacheralso spends three more hours a week on the job than in 1961 and only 32 minutes for lunch,compared with 40 in 1961. Teachers also report spending an average of $443 out of their own pockets and one in 12 report spending over $1,000 yearly for school supplies and resources. Though the average salary hasclimbed steadily, from $5,264 in 1961 ($32,598 in today's dollars) to $43,262 in 2001, this isattributed to seniority. The percentage of male teachers has dropped by about one-third, from 31percent to 21 percent; while minority teacher numbers have also dropped since 1971, from 12percent to 10 percent. Only 61 percent of current teachers say they would become teachers againif they had to start over\u2014down from 77 percent in 1961. Competition for TeachersCompetition from higher-paying jobs will make it difficult for public schools to ensure that all teachers are highly qualified, reports the General Accounting Office (GAO). The No Child LeftBehind law requires that teachers have a bachelor's degree and a state teaching certificate by2005-2006. Teachers must also have majored in their subject in college or passed state tests intheir subject. State education officials report that higher salaries offered by other jobs will makeit more difficult to employ and retain good teachers. Teens and AlcoholThe Institute of Medicine reports that in 1966, underage drinking caused 3,500 deaths, two million injuries, 1,200 babies born with fetal alcohol syndrome, and 57,000 people having to betreated for alcoholism. The social cost associated with underage drinking in 1966 was estimatedto be just under $53 billion. In 2002, 20 percent of eighth-graders surveyed had drunk alcoholwithin the past 30 days; 49 percent of high-schoolers are drinkers; and 29 percent admit tohaving drunk five or more drinks in a row in the past two weeks. Forty-one percent of collegestudents admit to being heavy drinkers. In 2000, the country spent $1.8 billion to discourageillegal drug use and only $71 million to discourage underage drinking. The Journal of the American Medical Association reports that magazines popular with teens, such as Rolling Stone, Sports Illustrated, and People, tend to have more liquor and beer ads than other titles, which suggests that the alcohol industry may be indirectly targeting underage drinkers. Researchers compared 35 magazines and found that for every one million more readersages 12 to 19, a magazine had about 60 percent more beer and distilled liquor ads. School CrimeSchool crime is on the decline, according to the Departments of Justice and Education. From 1995 to 2001, the percentage of students ages 12 to 18 who reported being victims of violence ortheft at school dropped from 10 percent to six percent. The rate of violent crimes at schoolamong these students dropped from 48 crimes per 1,000 students to 28 crimes from 1992 to2001. The report can be obtained at http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/iscs03.htm . Sleeping Babies Putting babies to bed on their backs not only reduces their risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), but also reduces other problems, such as stuffy noses and spitting up, as reported in theArchives of Pediatrics. The study of 3,733 infants found that babies who slept on their back spitup less and were less likely to develop fever or respiratory problems than babies who slept ontheir bellies. Student Loan Debt According to Nellie Mae, the average student graduates with nearly $19,000 in student loans: Average undergraduate debt = $18,900 For four-year public school = $17,100 For four-year private school = $21,200 Average monthly payment = $182 Average monthly payment as percentage of income = 9 percent Drugs and Crime Facts The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) has updated Drugs and Crime Facts, a section of the Web site, with information from 21 recent statistical publications. It summarizes statistics on drug useand related crimes, drug law violations, drug treatment under correctional supervision, the drug-control budget, and public opinion about drugs, as well as some data related to juvenile drug useand arrest trends. To obtain the report, see http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/dcf/contents.htm . Mononucleosis and Hodgkin's Young adults who get mononucleosis have more than double the risk of a rare type of cancer, Hodgkin's disease, a highly treatable cancer of the lymph system. But the role played by thecommon virus that causes mono was uncertain. The virus, Epstein-Barr, is found in about one-third of Hodgkin's tumors, reports the New England Journal of Medicine . In a study of more than 63,000 young adults suspected of having mono, researchers found that those who got monohad a higher than average chance of getting Hodgkin's, and the risk lasted for two decades.About one in 1,000 young adults will get the cancer, the researchers stated. Youth and the InternetA study completed by the Center for Communication Policy reports that nearly one in five parents complain that children spend too much time online, up from 11 percent in 2000.However, 23 percent of the parents said the Internet boosted their children's grades; fewer thanfour percent felt it hurt them. The National School Board's Foundation found that Internet usetends to steal time from TV viewing and that wired kids tend to spend more time readingnewspapers, magazines, and books. Reports indicate that 7- to 12-year-olds do the following withtheir computer time: Play games - 87 percent Listen to music - 63 percent Do schoolwork - 60 percent Watch videos, movies, cartoons - 36 percent Learn about celebrities - 27 percent In a related study, the Kaiser Family Foundation reports in Z ero to Six: Electronic Media in the Lives of Infants, Toddlers, and Preschoolers , that two-thirds of children live in homes where the television is left on at least half the time. Along with computers and video games, the reportadds that children six and younger spend about the same amount of time every day using \"screenmedia\" (one hour, 58 minutes) as they do playing outside and much more than the time theyspend reading or being read to (39 minutes). According to the researchers, 43 percent of childrenyounger than two watch TV every day and one in four has a TV set in his or her room. Students and AP CoursesAP courses, created half a century ago by the New York-based College Board, traditionally were only offered to high school juniors and seniors attracted by the academic challenge and thechance to gain college credit. But between 1993 and 2003, the number of high school freshmentaking AP examinations increased from 498 to 2,120. The number of 10th-graders taking theexams, which are written and scored by outside experts, went from 18,045 to 60,331. Althoughthe total number of AP tests taken by ninth- and 10th-graders represented only four percent of the 1.75 million exams given last May, many more schools are signing on.

Stressed-Out Teenagers Stressed-out teenagers who are bored and have $25 or more a week in spending money are 50 percent more likely to smoke, drink, get drunk, or use drugs, according to the National Center onAddiction and Substance Abuse. Researchers found that students attending schools with 800 orfewer students or religious schools are less likely to abuse substances. Movies and SmokingTeenagers are significantly more likely to start smoking if they watch movies featuring stars who smoke cigarettes, and teens whose parents don't smoke are the most likely to be swayed byactors lighting up on screen, reports the journal Lancet. Teens who watched the most movies with smoking were almost three times more likely to start smoking than those who watched thefewest number of movies with smoking. The researchers followed 2,600 Vermont and NewHampshire children ages 10 to 14 for two years. Because the study looked at young adolescents,it did not establish a direct relationship between movie smoking and actual habitual smoking bychildren. Rather, it found that the movies encouraged teens to try smoking, and that more than 50percent of teens who tried smoking did so after seeing smoking in movies. Other research showsthat every day, about 2,050 teens aged 12 to 17 start smoking and that about one-third of themwill die prematurely because of smoking-related diseases. Mentoring EvaluationsMentoring programs, especially those that pair one child with a supportive and responsible adult, have been evaluated and the results are reported in Mentoring: A Promising Strategy for Youth Development. Results include reduced substance abuse, improved educational achievement, less truancy, and more positive attitudes toward school and the future. These successes are associatedwith programs where the mentor has frequent contact with the youngster and a qualityrelationship is formed. Children whose mentors saw them infrequently or who did not form apositive relationship with them showed weaker or even negative impacts. Researchers also foundthat programs in which the needs and interests of the youth drove the relationship were moresuccessful than programs in which the adults prescribed the goals. Mentoring programs appear to have the most benefit for children who are most at risk, including those who come from disadvantaged family, school, and community situations. These childrenmay lack resources and support groups available to other children. To obtain a copy of the fullreport, contact Child Trends at (202) 362-5580; Internet: www.childtrends.org . Race and Arrests A federal study completed by Carl Pope and Howard Snyder found \"no direct evidence that an offender's race affects police decisions to take juveniles into custody in such incidents.\" Thestudy examined a sampling of 102,905 juvenile offenders from the FBI's National Incident-Based Reporting System, covering youth arrested for serious violent crimes, excluding murder, in17 states in 1997 and 1998. In this set of data, only 34.2 percent of all juvenile offendersreported by victims were arrested, meaning that juvenile offenders have odds of about two to oneof not being arrested. The data indicate that there could be indirect bias in that non-white juveniles are more likely to be arrested when the victim is white than when the victim is non-white. The researchers found that police arrested 35.9 percent of all white juvenile offenders reported to them and 30.4 percentof all non-white offenders reported to them.

Published by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts www.uscourts.gov Publishing Information Volume 68 Number 1 Home Review of Professional Periodicals The Prison Journal Crime and Delinquency The Prison Journal REVIEWED BY SAM TORRES\"Exploring the Effects of Childhood Sexual Abuse and Its Impact on HIV/AIDS Risk-Taking Behavior Among Women Prisoners,\" by J.L. Mullings, James W. Marquart, and D.J. Hartley(Vol. 83, No. 4, December 2003), pp. 442-463. This article focuses on the various elements of childhood sexual abuse and their relationship to HIV/AIDS risk behaviors, using a sample of approximately 1,200 newly admitted femaleprisoners in 1998-1999. Consistent with a myriad of prior studies, the authors found that sexuallyabused prisoners were more likely to have experienced childhood neglect, come from one-parentfamilies, and had parents with drug and/or alcohol and psychiatric problems. Female prisonerswho had been sexually abused reportedly engaged in more high-risk drug and sexual activitiesthan their non-abused counterparts. Mullings et al. begin by noting that the estimates of the prevalence of adult-child sexual abuse reveal that 28 percent of women and 16 percent of men have been sexually abused before theage of 16 (p. 442). That childhood sexual abuse has wide-ranging and long-term effects is hardlyopen to question\u2014it can result in such disorders as post-traumatic stress, depression, anxietyattacks, and sexual dysfunction. An additional and critical negative effect is the associationbetween childhood abuse and adult substance abuse. The rate of childhood sexual abuse amongfemale substance abusers is twice as high as that found in the general population (p. 443). Astudy of women who were abused as children revealed that approximately 8 percent becamecriminal offenders in adulthood. Women who have been abused as children may later abusealcohol or drugs in an effort to self-medicate or reduce the negative symptoms associated withthe abuse. The article also cites research linking childhood sexual abuse with adult prostitution,sexual compulsivity, early consensual sex, and a greater than average number of sexual partnersthan non-abused peers. Thus, childhood sexual abuse has been linked to high-risk sexual and drug-taking behavior and HIV/AIDS, particularly among women. Women who have been sexually abused are more likelyto engage in behavior placing them at risk for HIV/AIDS infection, such as trading sex for drugs,inconsistent condom use, and multiple partners. Other \"risky behaviors\" involve the sharing ofneedles, and drug use by injection. Mullings et al. emphasize that the research examining therelationship between childhood sexual victimization and subsequent high-risk behavior and drug-related activities among female prisoners is important for several reasons. First, the number offemale prisoners has been increasing steadily. Second, arrest trends between 1984 to 1997 revealthat women are increasingly arrested for drug-related crimes. Forty-six percent of female prisoners in one study committed their crimes under the influence of drugs, and 80 percent used drugs on a regular basis (p.444). Third, the incidence of HIV among women is increasing at a faster rate than for other populations. Three percent of female prisoners are HIV positive,compared to 2 percent of male prisoners. Furthermore, the rate of HIV infection among femaleprisoners has increased by almost 90 percent, compared to 28 percent for males. According tostudies cited in this article, it appears that the high prevalence of HIV infection among femaleinmates is directly related to risky drug activities. Fourth, 43 percent of female inmates nationwide were sexually or physically abused prior to incarceration, compared to 12 percent of the males. Given these, it would appear that the prisonis in a unique position to provide special treatment programs to address the underlying causes ofthe substance-abusing behavior which frequently results in criminal activity and incarceration. The data used for this study were obtained from the Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse by Texas A & M University through face-to-face interviews with a sample of womenprisoners incarcerated between May 1998 and March 1999. Respondents were interviewed uponadmission at the intake process at two separate facilities. The interview and questionnaireaveraged 70 minutes. Two dependent variables were identified (HIV drug risks & HIV sexualrisks), and a single item measured the independent variable\u2014whether the inmate had ever beensexually abused, mistreated, or raped prior to age 18. The results of the study found that women who had been sexually abused younger than the age 18 were significantly younger at admission to prison and more likely to be white than the non-abused comparison group. Furthermore, sexually abused prisoners reported a wide variety ofunstable family characteristics. Overall, the sexually abused group experienced all measures ofchild neglect at greater frequencies than non-abused women. For example, sexually abusedwomen were three times more likely to be unsupervised or left alone when too young, a situationconducive to sexual exploitation. Generally, women in the abused group grew up in environmentsfraught with chaos, dysfunction, and lack of care. The findings of this study support previousresearch that suggests sexually abused girls engage in early onset of substance abuse to self-medicate in dealing with the trauma. Given the large number of women in prison who abusedrugs, the authors conclude that these women were significantly more likely to be involved inbehavior that places them at risk for HIV infection. Female inmates who were sexually abused as children may require special prison-based interventions to reduce their HIV risk, particularly with regard to sexual risk taking. Identifyingthose at greatest risk for HIV is only a first step in treatment and education, according to theauthors. Because of their unique needs, female prisoners require gender-specific and responsiveinterventions. \"One-size-fits-all\" treatment programs may not be in the best interest of femaleinmates. Mullings et al. suggest that programs for women prisoners must include substance abusetreatment, physical and mental health care, job skills training, parenting and reunificationservices, child visitation, and child and adult victimization services. Policy implications from thestudy include improved intake screening for female inmates that would identify issues such as ahistory of childhood maltreatment, as well as substance abuse and risky sexual behavior. The study replicates and reinforces a multitude of prior research that highlights the relationship between childhood sexual abuse and adult substance abuse and criminality. While other studiesfocus on the childhood abuse/drug abuse/crime relationship, this study expands the analysis toaddress the high-risk activities that place the female prisoner at significantly greater risk for HIV/AIDS infection. Needless to say, the implications of this high risk are of considerable importancewhen examining HIV transmission to the general population, transmission of HIV to the fetusduring pregnancy, and treatment and costs associated if the inmate becomes symptomatic. Again,most of what has been reported in this article is already known in the discipline and also knownto correctional policymakers. What may be needed is an in-depth cost analysis to demonstrate towhat extent improved classification and effective treatment programs would reduce HIVtransmission and recidivism and, in the long run, be more cost-effective than current strategies. back to top Crime and Delinquency REVIEWED BY CHRISTINE J. SUTTON\"Opening the Manager's Door: State Probation Officer Stress and Perceptions of Participation in Workplace Decision Making\" by Risdon N. Slate, Terry L. Wells, and W. Wesley Johnson(2003). The old Carnation Milk commercial, \"contented cows give better milk,\" is essentially the conclusion of this study, which looked at state probation officer stress and how it affectsperformance and the officer's well being. The authors concluded employees perform better withthe development and use of participatory management schemes within probation organizations.This is the key to better balance and performance. Through a review of the literature, the authorsidentified probation as a people business, oftentimes requiring intense, stressful confrontationswith recalcitrant offenders. Additionally, due to budget constraints, more felons are receivingprobation. Probation officers have more contact with offenders than any other criminal justicepractitioner and caseloads have continued to increase at unprecedented levels. The majority of the studies done on job stress and burnout in criminal justice have focused on police and correctional officers. Furthermore, researchers have neglected the Federal probationofficer, who supervises parolees as well. Stress was denied as a nonspecific response of the bodyto any demand. Stress can result in both positive and negative circumstances. Prolonged andextreme stress can manifest itself in withdrawal from work, emotional exhaustion and burnout.The stress levels of probation officers have been found to be higher than those of the generalpopulation. The dangers inherent to the job and having to make recommendations that result incustodial sentences were identified as two significant potential stressors for probation officers. The authors used a 61-question questionnaire, sent electronically to 636 probation officers in a southern state to collect data, measuring contributors of stress and how stress can manifest intothe deterioration of physical health of the probation officer. The sample population consisted of52 percent women, 48 percent male officers, with 61 percent married, a median age of 36.2years, an average of two years prior experience and a mean amount of time on the job of 8.5years. The survey was divided into components measuring the level of external, internal job ortask, personal and physical stressed experienced by the respondents. Questions distinguishedmanagers from line officers, determined caseload size, identified officers with specializedcaseloads, allowed officers to specify what function is the primary focus of their job, as well asthe number of sick days used in the last year. As identified by the respondent officers, the most influential stressors were found to be inadequate salary, courts being too lenient on offenders, lack of promotional opportunities,frustration with the criminal justice system, excessive paperwork, ineffectiveness of the judicialsystem, expectations to do too much in too little time, lack of recognition for good work,ineffectiveness of the correctional system, inadequate support from the agency and lack ofcommunity resources. The authors recognized that not all the stressors are within the control of probation administrators, but several could be combated through organizational means. The result of thefindings indicated employees who perceive they have input into workplace decision making aremore likely to express higher opinions of their job and less likely to report physical symptoms ofstress, which translates into greater productivity and morale, with less absenteeism and employeeturnover. Empowering employees by giving them a voice in running the organization lets themknow they are valued and serves to instill a sense of worth, resulting in dedicated employees. Participatory management strategies were found to be critical to maximizing the functioning of human capital. As probation agencies continue to be pushed beyond their designed \"hull speed,\"they are asked to do more with less and public safety demands the probation managers andpolicy makers stay in tune and remain responsive to front line officers.The authors conclude the results suggest participatory management can be a critical factor in the process of addressing and reducing employee stress. Although the government usually lags behind the private sector in a number of ways, the use of participatory management styles inprobation agencies should be an exception. back to top The articles and reviews that appear in Federal Probation express the points of view of the persons who wrote them and not necessarily the points of view of the agencies and organizations with which these persons are affiliated.

Howard Abadinsky. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth/Thomson, 2003. 408 pp. $75.95. REVIEWED BY DAVID D. NOCE, UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGEHoward Abadinsky studied organized crime (OC) as a state parole officer for 15 years, a sheriff 's office inspector, a university professor of criminal justice, the founder of the InternationalAssociation for the Study of Organized Crime, and a presidential consultant on OC. OrganizedCrime is, first of all, a college text, created to facilitate the course he taught. The first edition in 1981 introduced students to the basic characteristics of OC and the writers of its classic studieson which Abadinsky frequently draws to great effect. Each successive edition reflected thechanges he observed in OC groups and in the nation's responses to them. Organized Crime combines the author's micro-observations and descriptions of criminal groups and their activities into a macroscopic picture. His language and organization make a book that iseasily read by laypersons, justice professionals, college students, and casual readers. The seventhedition reduced the anecdotal detail, including some references to the ever-colorful nicknames ofprime OC characters found in the sixth edition. Even so, readers will appreciate how Abadinskyhas blended principles and theories with stories from the streets. Organized Crime puts flesh onsuch charging and sentencing concepts as \"jointly undertaken criminal activity,\" \"same course ofconduct,\" and \"common scheme or plan.\" Criminal organizations sap national and international vitality, divert economies from the common welfare, wreak havoc on lawabiding lives, and provide self-sustaining petri dishes for thereplication of evil. The history and the landscape of America are littered with the detritus ofcriminal organizations. For their limited membership and small numbers, they commit anextraordinary amount of criminal activity. Their activities can be simple or complex, continuallylooking for areas of opportunity. They defraud millions by \"cramming\" telephone bills withunauthorized charges and they demand protection money. They require a reasoned, vigorous, andstrong response from criminal justice systems, not only in law enforcement but also in pre-sentence investigations and postsentence supervision. The proper responses must understandOC's national causes, international roots, and entrenched cultures that require the use of criminalinformers (e.g., the \"pentiti\" in Italy). Organized Crime is a primer that also provides modern tools for further research. It chronicles OC in the United States and describes its international, multi-cultural roots, its history, its notorious characters, the businesses that sustain its life, and the sociological factors that direct it.The work's five parts are divided into fifteen chapters. Each chapter is well organized and includes review questions for students and internet sites for further investigation and informationon the treated subjects. Approximately 1,600 different factual sources and professional studies\u2014which are compiled in an alphabetical reference list\u2014are cited in the book. Other indices listalphabetically the cited authors and the treated subject matter. Peppered through the work areundercover police photographs and boxed textual asides that stimulate interest (\"Also Not RocketScientists. He was called 'Frankie the Beast' because of his skill in using a baseball bat onvictims. This enforcer for the Colombo Family spotted the concealed video camera and turned toa very fearful Vinnie, the informant who had led him into an elaborate FBI sting: 'Hey, lookslike a great [security] system you got here, Vinnie.' His capo, he explained, was looking for a security system for his home. Vinnie had one installed, gratis (Bonavolonta and Duffy 1996: 148).\" The book's five parts lead the reader through OC in the United States: its structures, its sociological seeds and underpinnings, its international roots, its specific business interests, andthe American government's attempts to limit its reach by legislation. OC defies precise, generally accepted definition. Abadinsky has selected eight criteria for inclusion here. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of Organized Crime derives from thelimitations imposed by the first of these criteria: that OC is non-ideological. Abadinsky'sconsiderable efforts thus focus on groups motivated by money and power, not social doctrine,political beliefs, or ideological concerns. Among the groups necessarily excluded by thisdefinition are terrorists and the Ku Klux Klan. Whether criminal groups are motivated byideology or money and power, their actions are illegal, often violent, and injure the innocent.Perhaps Abadinsky will draw his net wider in a future edition. Nevertheless, the author shinesbrightly in his presentation of the long history of criminal organizations and the vital literatureabout them. The other attributes of criminal organizations refined by Abadinsky are important markers. OC groups use a hierarchy to control, have a limited or exclusive membership, perpetuate themselvesin ongoing criminal conspiracy, use illegal means to achieve ends, specialize and divide thelabors of members, are monopolistic, and operate with rules and regulations. OC groups followeither the bureaucratic/corporate model (e.g., outlaw motorcycle clubs) or use apatrimonial/patron-client network (e.g., American Mafia). OC groups evolve with the profitability of their operations. They exist in a dangerous environment and must continually adapt to survive. For example, illegal motorcycle gangs havemoved from leathers and choppers to business suits and limos, and developed relations withMafia families. Abadinsky surveys the history of OC in America, but offers a note of caution about journalistic sources. Journalists tend to be unreliable historians of useful facts, because they highlight andperhaps create sensational events for the public appetite. In addition, journalists themselves canbe prey to the political ends of anonymous government sources. The root causes of OC are discerned from basic sociological principles. Abadinsky surveys differential association of potential group members with mentors, differential opportunities forcriminal success, social control theory, and ethnic succession, to understand the broad scope ofOC. OC thrives in national subcultures formed from economic, ethnic, and racial discrimination\u2014circumstances that prevent individuals from entering mainstream life. The Irish emigrated onaccount of devastating famine and terrible government policies only to find themselves similarlydisadvantaged in America with lack of education, wealth, and influence. The ability to speakEnglish and rotten machine politics bound them into a formidable force for self-preservation. The American Mafia occupies much of the first five chapters and is the main subject of Chapter 7. The members and associate members of the various Families are labeled with significantmonikers: made guy, wise guy, button, being straightened out, goodfella, amico, and \"a friend ofours.\" The importance of the groups' rules sometimes takes second place to personal influence. Not every new member must kill someone; those with powerful friends can be exempt from such dirty work. Yet, the strength of the oath of American Mafia membership is such that upon ordersone must kill even a relative without hesitation. Crime group members do not earn salaries in atraditional sense; they generate income by operating their own criminal activities almost asindependent franchise holders. Competition for money can cause conflict between the Familiesand the basic method of dispute resolution, other than gunfire, is arbitration, a \"sitdown\" or a\"table\" meeting. The Italian experience, which ultimately resulted in the American Mafia, differed historically from the Irish. For a thousand years, in the hostile environment of southern Italy's Mezzogiornoarea, especially Sicily, such principles of self-preservation as famiglia (the ties of blood relationship), comparatico or comparaggio (the god-parenthood of outsiders being allowed into the group for limited purposes), omerta (non-cooperation with authority), and vendetta (revenge for any slight to the family) developed. In modern history, the political unification of Italyresulted in the economic suppression of and social discrimination against the southern Italians.Abadinsky explains that the lowercase term \" mafia is a state of mind, a way of life\" and ought to be distinguished from the illegal, secret Mafia organization. Organized Crime surveys important historical events of OC, especially in New York and Chicago. Abadinsky recounts the characters and events that enlivened New York'sCastellammarese War in 1930 and the city's Five Mafia Families. In Chicago, the reader is givena geography lesson (everything north of Madison Street is the North Side; south of Madison isthe South Side; everything west of intersecting State Street is the West Side; and there is no EastSide). Chicago's OC is traced from Mike McDonald's victory in the mayoral election of 1873. Indifferent eras, Chicago's organized crime activity was expressed through the likes of \"HinkyDink\" Mike Kenna, John \"the Bath\" Coughlin, William Thompson, and, of course,the Prohibition-era Chicago Wars, Al Capone, and the emergence of \"The Outfit\" and its \"streetcrews.\" Of interest to investigators is the fact that in New York informers are sometimes \"madeguys,\" but not in Chicago. Chapter 6 chronicles African-American and Black OC. Soldiers returning from the Vietnam War used their contacts with Asian heroin producers and bypassed traditional OC groups. Abadinskydescribes the generation and operation of Frank Lucas in New York, the Gangster Disciples, ElRukns/Black P. Stone Nation, the Bloods and the Crips, the Nigerians, and the Jamaicans.Chapter 8 treats Latino OC, including the Cuban-Colombian drug connection, the many drugcartels, economic causes of Mexican drug trafficking, and the Mexican Mafia, Mexican-Americans who influence criminal activities inside and outside West Coast American prisons.Chapters 9 and 10 discuss the formation and history of Russian and Asian OC in America. Chapter 11 discusses the principle that the business of OC is extortion and the criminals who create the illegal goods and services are in fact its parasitic victims. The goods and services ofOC include gambling, loansharking, theft and fencing, and the business of sex. Chapter 12chronicles the history of labor racketeering from the post-Civil War era through the developmentof the \"Big Four\" unions, the crime-busting efforts of United States Attorney and then NewYork Mayor Rudolf Giuliani in the Fulton Fish Market. The author includes businessracketeering and restraint of trade as OC evils, especially in the construction industry and privatesolid waste carting (the business of television's Tony Soprano, Abadinsky reminds us). Chapter 12 also describes the evils of OC in legitimate business activities. In these endeavors profits are increased by coercion, crime proceeds are laundered with legitimately generated cash,legitimate wealth is transferred to OC members, OC members are given employment whenreleased on probation or parole, and legitimate businesses can front for illegal activities.Abadinsky describes various bankruptcy fraud scams and stock fraud. Chapter 13 discusses the history and operation of the national and international drug trade. Morphine was first derived from the poppy around 1700 and around 1900 led to heroin, whichwas initially marketed as nonhabit- forming. The Opium Wars of the 1800s followed China's initial outlawing of opium importation and the Chinese authorities' dumping of opium waiting to be unloaded from foreign ships. In 1840 and in 1856, British forces attacked China, coerced the payment of compensation for the dumped opium, and Hong Kong became a British colony.Chapter 13 also discusses the deviant international politics that led to the American Harrison Actin 1914, which required federal registration of certain drug trafficking. Abadinsky again gives ageography lesson when describing the business of heroin in the Golden Triangle and the GoldenCrescent of Southeast Asia. The businesses and development of cocaine, barbiturates, methaqualone, phencyclidine, are like swatches of a crazy quilt of crime. Chapter 14 describes some of the federal statutes that energize the war against illicit drugs, the constitutional limitations on law enforcement, the effects of corrupt law enforcement, and the useof informants.Chapter 15 describes law enforcement efforts of executive branch agencies,including those of the Department of Justice and the Department of Defense (active in druginterdiction), and the international cooperation that supports INTERPOL. Abadinsky concludes his work with an expansive overview of OC in America's history, including corporate crimes of recent years. OC is a dynamic phenomenon, likely always to be with us inone form or another. Government's role is to \"trim the herd while occasionally dealing shatteringblows to organized criminals and their organizations.\" Proper policy responses to OC must bemindful of its history and the potential side effects of proposed policy changes. The forcesopposed to OC must be ever-mindful of its presence and must cooperate to limit its vast powerto destroy. back to top Frontier Justice Harsh Justice: Criminal Punishment and the Widening Divide between America and Europe. By James Q. Whitman. New York: Oxford University Press, 2003. Hardback, 311 pp.REVIEWED BY ERIC ASSUR ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA Corrections professionals may find this historical and sociological book to be both depressing and enlightening. The volume of historical research may overwhelm all but history buffs. Thebook, obviously well researched, ends with over 100 pages of notes, references and index. Itopens some interesting windows to the jails and prisons of the nation. Both wealth and social status have long been determining factors of treatment in the criminal justice system. In pre-Industrial Age England, the petitions or warrants almost always statedwhether the accused was a laborer, landowner or other person of status. Prisons were evensegregated by social class rather than classification related to security needs. By continentalEuropean standards, legal infractions were viewed as infractions, rather than shameful truecrimes. The criminal codes written in the new American lands made many violations of publicorder more serious and attached stigma and the criminal label. Our labor or work camps, the oldchain gangs, were more related to the need to complete public works projects than to prisonerrehabilitation. Whitman addresses the issue of shame and degradation at length. For example, why do inmates now wear uniforms, striped suits, or orange jump suits in the U.S. while they are allowed todress in street clothes in many European prisons? Or, just what was the effect of the social classof a colonist who appeared before early tribunals in centuries past? And how was it that thephysician-inventor of the famous tool for beheading (Frenchman Joseph I. Guillotin) and theFrench revolution led that society to a less harsh justice system? The author compares theAmerican criminal justice system with the comparable systems in current and past German andFrench society. He also briefly notes some references to other European communities. Whitman's views are certainly transparent. Chapter titles and the book title itself all reflect his search for an answer for one question: Why is American punishment so cruel? Whitman addresses modern trends and comments that determinate sentences simply represent the abandonment of any merciful version of individualized justice. He claims that our partisanpolitical system has led to radical shifts in policy and practice in our states depending on theparty du jour and the whims of the governor and Department of Corrections head. Europe, on theother hand, tends to operate institutions more through career corrections administrators and lessthrough politicians. The \"three strikes\" legislation and the treatment of juveniles as adults insome states represents the opposite of the enlightened criminal punishment of the Americanpenitentiary movement that Alexis de Tocqueville observed in Democracy in America in the 1840s. Harsh Justice ends by asking about the state of corrections today. Each reader must answer that question. The final sentences of the book are not overly optimistic. Like any very large ship,corrections of course will take much time and effort. Whitman believes that our growingcorrections enterprise is way off course and will not soon change. back to top Leading Edge Leadership. By Rudolph W. Giuliani (with Ken Kurson). New York: Talk Miramax Books, 2002.REVIEWED BY MICHAEL ERIC SIEGEL WASHINGTON, DC Rudolph Giuliani has faced many leadership tests. As a prosecutor, he brought several organized crime figures to justice. As a twoterm Republican mayor of New York City, where Democratsoutnumber Republicans by five to one, he was credited with major improvements in a cityfrequently described as \"ungovernable.\" Finally, in the most highly publicized of all of hisaccomplishments, Mr. Giuliani courageously led his beloved city through the worst terroristattack ever to befall the United States. What has he learned about leadership from all these experiences? Quite a bit, it turns out. In Leadership, Giuliani shares what he has learned in an engaging, honest, sometimes humorous, and frequently poignant manner. I strongly recommend this book not only as a good read, butalso as an excellent resource for those who manage and lead in the public sector. Giuliani recounts the awful experiences of September 11, 2001 in compelling opening and closing chapters, while dedicating the bulk of the book to 14 principles of leadership, such asprepare relentlessly, organize around purpose, surround yourself with great people, everyone'saccountable all the time, develop and communicate strong beliefs, underpromise and overdeliver,and stand up to bullies. Emphasizing that \"Leadership does not simply happen. It can be taught,learned, developed,\" Giuliani illustrates each principle through cogent examples and meaningfulinsights. Two of these leadership principles are particularly apt for court employees: \"prepare relentlessly\" and \"everyone's accountable all the time.\" Prepare relentlesslyPreparing relentlessly requires leaders to resist the temptation to take anything for granted. Relentless preparation assisted the mayor in his quest to reduce crime, as he insisted on dailycrime mapping and analysis and on the deployment of police resources to the areas of need asrevealed by the data. Relentless preparation also helped Giuliani and his team respond to the nightmare of September 11, 2001. This was not the first time they had to respond to a crisis, and they were able to applysome of the procedures developed in response to earlier emergencies, such as the 1993 bombingof the World Trade Center. The time they spent planning and simulating emergency response efforts turned out to be helpful in spite of the unprecedented nature of the 9/11 emergency. Giuliani calls the successful evacuation of 25,000 people from the twin towers on 9/11 one ofthe \"greatest rescue operations in history.\" There is a good lesson here for court leaders currentlychallenged with developing Occupant Emergency Plans and Continuity of Operations Planblueprints for their courts. While our human tendency is to resist preparing for emergencies,advance planning really pays off when a crisis actually occurs. But there is another dimension of relentless preparation that informs leaders. Giuliani is an enthusiastic advocate of continual learning. He created a course in city government for himself ashe prepared to take on the challenges of managing America's largest city. He recognizes theinfluences of great leaders from the past, such as Winston Churchill, and testifies to theimportance of reading history. He acknowledges that even ideas from academics can help leadersdo their jobs-for example, the \"broken windows\" theory of James Q. Wilson and the\"reinventing government\" argument of Ted Osborne. So strong is Giuliani's belief in learning as an integral part of preparation for leadership, that shortly after September 11, when \"free time did not exist,\" he took some to \"learn more about theissues that had been forced upon the city.\" He carved out time to read Joseph Bodansky's BinLaden: The Man Who Declared War on America , and then met with the author. He also met with Henry Kissinger to try and understand the global dynamics of a \"world transformed\" (theironic title of Kissinger's dissertation at Harvard). While most of us can't get Henry Kissinger onthe phone, we can make the time to continue learning about issues of importance to the judiciaryand to accelerate that learning during periods of great personal and organizational transition. Everyone's responsible all the timeThe former mayor describes a sign that was prominently displayed on his desk: \"I'm responsible.\" He states, \"Nothing builds confidence in a leader more than a willingness to takeresponsibility for what happens during his watch\"\u2014words that would make Harry Truman beamand can inspire all who believe in outcomes-based management. Giuliani claims that under his \"watch\" (1993-2001), murder, burglary, auto-theft and shootings all declined by 70 percent in New York City. During those years he also asserts that overallcrime fell by 57 percent, and that there was a striking 93 percent reduction in inmate-on-inmateviolence in the city's jails. Even allowing for some measure of exaggeration, these numberscompel our attention (and other sources support their general accuracy). The logical question is:How does a leader achieve results like these? The answer lies partly in Hizzoner's willingness to accept responsibility for driving down the crime rate and making sure that his deputies and staff shared that same sense of responsibility. Itis also clear that Giuliani knows how to create a culture of responsibility and an organizationbuilt on performance by focusing systematically on the causes of problems and on the likelihoodof success of different solutions. For example, Giuliani says that for years police forces focused on the number of arrests to prove their success in fighting crime. Obviously, though, by the time of the arrest the crime hasoccurred and it's really too late to claim success. Instead, Giuliani and his original crime-fightingteam, including former NYPD Commissioner William Bratton (now police chief in LA) and hisdeputy, Jack Maple, focused on studying crime patterns to evolve a strategy of crime preventionand not just crime control. They used technology to advantage also, developing a computerized system that allowed everyone from the mayor to the police commissioner to the precinctcommander to see whose numbers were improving and whose not. It is easy to appreciate thesense of accountability that resides in this kind of an approach. Court leaders can learn from theachievements of the NYPD that they must measure success by performance and outcomes, andnot the rhetoric and promises made to the public. Giuliani's book is not perfect. He suffers from the public figure's tendency to claim what somewould call excessive credit for accomplishments that were not his alone. He does not dwell on what some saw as his unbecoming effort to stay in office past the end of his term. Nevertheless, I was impressed by Giuliani's references to a team effort and to his competent advisers and aides in episodes and events reviewed in the book. All of us who practice publicadministration on the local level can learn a great deal from the insight and the humanity thatemerge from almost every page of this book. back to top The articles and reviews that appear in Federal Probation express the points of view of the persons who wrote them and not necessarily the points of view of the agencies and organizations with which these persons are affiliated.

Becausemost domestic violence victims who come to official attention are women, we refer to thevictims in the female form. Furthermore, female victims are far likelier to request, or beprovided with, BEM. 5 The two departments had varying degrees of records to consult; in River County the data were quite extensive, while Lakefront's data were sparse. 6 Lakefront and River County are pseudonyms. 7 Lakefront equips victims with a field monitoring device, but River County does not; River County's equipment can detect the victim's entrance and exit from home (assuming she carriesher duress pendant), but Lakefront's equipment cannot; and River County's equipment transmitswhatever sounds occur at the victim's home when the base unit has been activated. 8 During our research, a proxy of a participating defendant murdered a River County victim protected by BEM. The proxy murdered her the night before she was to testify against her ex- partner. He claimed he was acting as a \"Good Samaritan,\" trying to save the children of the couple, out of fear that the victim's ex-partner would kill both the woman and her children. In this case, EM logs provided evidence that it was not the defendant on BEM who committed the murder, since records showed he never left his home on the night of the slaying. 9 Caseload size varied considerably between the two programs. The number of enrolled defendants at any point ranged from 12 to 43 in River County and averaged 25 during the studyperiod. The range at Lakefront was approximately 0 to 2, with an average of 0 or 1. 10 Our research (Erez, Ibarra, and Lurie, forthcoming) has found that victims or defendants referred to a BEM program may not participate for reasons such as limited economic means,inability to secure a separate residence or installation of a land-based telephone line,unwillingness to disable certain telephone features (e.g., call waiting, internet access), and limitedor blocked radio frequency transmission/ reception in area of residence. 11 The programs had different levels of victim support services. River County assigned a special officer to deal with victims' issues, 24/7. This officer handled all concerns related tovictim participation in the program, including the installation of the equipment, notification ofcourt appointments, explanation of court proceedings, and provision of various forms of trouble-shooting. This officer also offered counseling and court escort as needed. At Lakefront, the sameofficer handled both offender and victim issues, and had little contact with victims bycomparison. 12 Elsewhere (Erez, Ibarra, and Lurie, forthcoming) we discuss how defendants perceive the punitive dimension of their respective program. River County defendants were especiallyconcerned about the liberty restrictions and heightened level of supervision; Lakefrontdefendants were more concerned about the costs involved in participating in the program. 13 The data provided by Lakefront were incomplete in this respect, so the average is a rough estimate. back to top The Imposition of Economic Sanctions in Philadelphia: Costs, Fines,and Restitution 1 These crimes were robbery (14,494), aggravated assault (13,718), theft by unlawful taking (9,610), retail theft (7,616), burglary (7,384), receiving stolen property (6,491), simple assault(5,895), public assistance act violations (5,294), forgery (2,643), murder (1,733), unauthorizeduse of an automobile (1,307), attempted theft by unlawful taking (1189), recklessly endangeringanother person (1,149), criminal trespass (956), harassment (801), terroristic threats (784), firstdegree murder (624), attempted burglary (381), theft by deception (365), arson (351),intimidation of witness or victim (327), stalking (228), causing or risking catastrophe (110),homicide by vehicle while DUI (71), involuntary manslaughter (105), attempted theft bydeception (105), robbery of motor vehicle (77), copying through recording devices (76),aggravated assault by vehicle while DUI (67), voluntary manslaughter (66), insurance fraud (61),ethnic intimidation (57), and buying or exchanging federal food stamps (50). 2 As a methodological note, the increase in restitution ordered for crimes against private individuals and businesses was significant, but not as large as appeared in data from thePennsylvania Commission on Sentencing. Using that data, imposition rates were more than twiceas high as those obtained using data from the Philadelphia computer files. The difference isprobably due to underreporting of cases to the Commission. For example, the Commission doesnot receive Philadelphia Municipal Court cases. 3 This test likely underestimates the difference between the judges in Philadelphia and the judges in the rest of the state, in that there are almost certainly some Philadelphia judges who didnot identify their county and whose responses are therefore included with the non-Philadelphiasample. back to top References The articles and reviews that appear in Federal Probation express the points of view of the persons who wrote them and not necessarily the points of view of the agencies and organizations with which these persons are affiliated.
