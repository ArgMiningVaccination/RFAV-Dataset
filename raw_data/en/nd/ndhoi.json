She is the author of the book \"Wake Up to Wonder.\" Learn about our Editorial Process Updated on January 03, 2019 The white angel light ray represents the purity and harmony that come from holiness. This ray is part of the metaphysical system of angel colors based on seven different light rays: blue, yellow, pink, white, green, red, and purple. Some people believe that the light waves of the seven angel colors vibrate at different electromagnetic energy frequencies in the universe, attracting the angels that have similar kinds of energy. Others believe that the colors are just fun ways of symbolizing the different types of missions that God sends angels on to help people. By thinking of angels who specialize in different types of work according to colors, people can focus their prayers according to what type of help they're seeking from God and his angels. Archangel Gabriel, the archangel of revelation, is in charge of the white angel light ray. People sometimes ask for Gabriel's help to: understand the messages that God is communicating to them so they can grow in holiness, clear away confusion and achieve the wisdom they need to make decisions, obtain the confidence they need to act on those decisions, communicate effectively to other people, and raise children well. Crystals Some of the different crystal gemstones associated with the white angel light ray are ruby, onyx, red garnet, jasper, and obsidian. Some people believe that the energy in these crystals can help people feel more confidence and courage, stand up for their convictions, and change negative attitudes and behaviors to positive ones. Chakra The white angel light ray corresponds to the root chakra, which is located at the base of the spine on the human body. Some people say that the spiritual energy from angels that flows into the body through the root chakra may help them physically (such as by helping them treat back conditions, nerve pain, and immune system conditions), mentally (such as by helping them develop more self-esteem and feel more secure in their relationships with other people), and spiritually (such as by helping them break free of materialism so they can shift their attention away from temporary things and toward holiness that has eternal value). Strongest Day The white angel light ray radiates most powerfully on Wednesday, some people believe, so they consider Wednesday to be the best day of the week to pray especially about situations that the white ray encompasses. Life Situations in the White Ray When praying in the white ray, you can ask God to send archangel Gabriel and the angels who work with him to help you learn more about the kind of person God wants you to become, and to inspire and motivate you to take the steps you need to take to grow into that person. You can confess and repent of your sins, and then receive God's forgiveness and the strength you need to make better decisions going forward with your life. God may send archangel Gabriel and the other white ray angels to help you purify your life of negative attitudes (such as arrogance or shame) or unhealthy habits (such as spending too much money and getting into debt or gossiping about others) that are contaminating your soul and slowing down your spiritual growth. If you're struggling with an addiction of some kind (such as to pornography or alcohol, you can ask God to send white ray angels to help you break free of your addiction. Praying in the white ray may also help you let go of your insecurities and develop more confidence, as you invite God to use white ray angels to show you how much God loves you, and what your life looks like from God's perspective. God may use white ray angels to deliver fresh doses of hope to you. White ray angels may also come on missions from God to help you develop the communication skills you need to speak, write, and listen successfully. That will increase the chances of you getting your messages across well to the people you want to reach (from your personal relationships to your work on the job) and also help you better understand what people are trying to communicate to you. If you're working on an artistic project, white ray angels may inspire you to create something beautiful that resonates in people's souls when they see it. Or, if you're trying to become a better parent, white ray angels may deliver the wisdom and strength that God wants you to have to raise your children well.
