Having painful or irregular periods? Fatigued? Feeling low or really stressed? These are all signs that your hormones may be out of balance. What are Hormones? [Hormones](https://juniperfamilyhealth.com/healthy-hormones/) are the body's chemical messengers. They travel through the bloodstream to tissues and organs. Understanding the major hormones and their role in the body, can help you take control of your health. Types of Hormones [Estrogen](https://www.hormone.org/hormones-and-health/hormones/estrogen), which is the main female sex hormone. It causes puberty, prepares the body for pregnancy and regulates the menstrual cycle. Estrogen levels decrease at menopause, causing a variety of symptoms in a woman's body. [Progesterone](https://www.hormone.org/hormones-and-health/hormones/progesterone)also plays a role in a woman's menstrual cycle and pregnancy, preparing the endometrium for a potential pregnancy after ovulation. [Cortisol](https://juniperfamilyhealth.com/blog/2017/3/6/stress-fatigue-burnout-what-you-need-to-know-about-cortisol-adrenal-fatigue)is best known for its contribution to the body's response to stress. [Thyroid hormone](https://juniperfamilyhealth.com/blog/2017/6/12/understanding-hypothyroidism-learn-how-to-protect-your-thyroid)sets our metabolic rate and contributes to energy levels, manages our weight, provides us with warmth, and is involved in digestive health as well as hair and skin health.
