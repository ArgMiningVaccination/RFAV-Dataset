SESS. 16 RS BR 1274 Page 1 of 129 BR127400.100 - 1274 - 4338 Jacketed AN ACT relating to medical cannabis. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky: SECTION 1. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 218A IS CREATED TO READ AS FOLLOWS: The General Assembly finds that: (1) Cannabis's recorded use as a medicine goes back nearly five thousand (5,000) years. Modern medical research has confirmed the beneficial uses for cannabis in treating or alleviating the pain, nausea, and other symptoms associated with a variety of debilita ting medical conditions, including cancer, multiple sclerosis, and HIV/AIDS, as found by the National Academies' Institute of Medicine in March 1999; (2) Studies published since the 1999 Institute of Medicine report have continued to show the therapeutic v alue of cannabis in treating a wide array of debilitating medical conditions. These include relief of the neuropathic pain caused by multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, and other illnesses and injuries that often fail to respond to conventional treatments, and r elief of nausea, vomiting, and other side effects of drugs used to treat HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C, increasing the chances of patients continuing on life -saving treatment regimens; (3) Cannabis has many currently accepted medical uses in the United States, having been recommended by thousands of licensed physicians to more than five hundred thousand (500,000) patients in states with medical cannabis laws. Cannabis's medical utility has been recognized by a wide range of medical and public health organization s, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American College of Physicians, the American Nurses Association, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, and many others; (4) Data from the Federal Bureau of Investigat ion's Uniform Crime Reports and the UNOFFICIAL COPY AS OF 03/02/16 16 REG. SESS. 16 RS BR 1274 Page 2 of 129 BR127400.100 - 1274 - 4338 Jacketed Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics show that approximately ninety -nine (99) out of every one hundred (100) cannabis arrests in the United States are made under state law, rather than under federal law. Consequently , changing state law will have the practical effect of protecting from arrest the vast majority of seriously ill patients who have a medical need to use cannabis; (5) The states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illin ois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia, have removed state -level criminal penalties from the medical use and cultivation of cannabis. Kentucky joins in this effort for the health and welfare of its citizens; (6) States are not required to enforce federal law or prosecute people for engaging in activities prohibited by federal law. Therefore, compliance with Sections 1 to 29 of this Act does not put the state of Kentucky in violation of federal law; and (7) State law should make a distinction between the medical and nonmedical uses of cannabis. Therefore, the purpose of Sections 1 to 29 of this Act is to protect patients with debilitating medical conditions, as well as their practitioners and providers, from arrest and prosecution, criminal and other penalties, and property forfeiture, if such patients engage in the medical use of cannabis.
