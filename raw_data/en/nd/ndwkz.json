GET VOUCHER NOW What To Expect With chiropractic care, your body has to go through a particular plan of care in order to repair itself correctly and fully. There are three general phases of chiropractic care . . . RELIEF CARE If you are in pain when you come into our Atlanta chiropractic office, our first objective is to help you reduce pain and start feeling better as soon as possible. Depending on the severity of the underlying condition which is causing your pain, it is typical for a patient to need chiropractic care or adjustments 2-3 times per week for 4-12 weeks. CORRECTIVE/RESTORATIVE CARE During the corrective phase of chiropractic care, muscles and other tissues are allowed to heal more completely, which helps prevent further injury or pain. The goal of corrective or restorative chiropractic care is to help bring your body back to 100% functioning. It is typical to need chiropractic care or adjustments about 4-8 times per month for 6-24 months, depending on your overall health and the severity of your problem. WELLNESS CARE Once your body has fully healed and you are no longer experiencing back pain or other pain symptoms, it is important to come in for periodic chiropractic adjustments to avoid further problems in the future. Usually, this phase of chiropractic care only requires a quick visit to the chiropractor 1-4 times per month, based on your lifestyle and goals. Every person is different. That's why we don't treat you like \"a number.\" Come see for yourself. Book a nothing-to-lose appointment to assess your specific needs and treatment plan! Click To Email Patient Testimonials See why we're the highest rated chiropractor in Atlanta & Sandy Springs... What Is Zone Healing? Zone healing works because \"Health Is Normal.\" Zone Healing was researched and developed nearly 100 years ago. Here's why it works... Think of your body as a complex electrical system, and think of your brain as the circuit breaker that controls all the wires (nerves) going to the rest of your body. If a disturbance exists, the brain's centers can essentially be \"shorted out,\" causing them to malfunction. By stimulating the spinal cord, we can flip the breaker. This restores communication, enabling the body's systems to better heal itself. The ZONE technique allows the doctor to know on a causative, neurological level which system (ZONE) the disturbance is in: Glandular, Eliminative, Nervous, Digestive, Muscular, or Circulatory. CORRECTIVE MASSAGE Corrective Massage is a technique used to correct damaged muscles and tissues by eliciting the client's own healing response to restore muscles, body tissues and nerve function improving neuromuscular activities like posture, range of motion, fascial adhesions, scar tissue etc. Every case is unique and starts with a full consultation; call us today to schedule an appointment.
