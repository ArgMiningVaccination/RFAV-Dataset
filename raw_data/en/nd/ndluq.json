The interdisciplinary curriculum and experiences provided by the Honors College coupled with the ability to work closely with outstanding faculty members in your major disciplines produces a tremendously rich education . Of course, you have to be an active participant ; this is not an opportunity that benefits a passive observer. - Charlie Slavin, Honors Dean 1997-2012 THE IMPACT & LEGACY OF CHARLIE SLAVIN Minerv a 20122 For all of us in the UMaine Honors com - munity, this is the year when we've had to come to grips with beloved Honors Dean Charlie Slavin being gone. Since Char - lie's passing in July, everyone affiliated with the Honors College - students, facul - ty, staff, graduates, and friends - balances a deep sense of loss with a deep sense of gratitude for all that Charlie gave to each of us, and the immense impact he had on the University of Maine and beyond in his more than thirty years on this campus. As interim dean, that is especially true for me. I come to work every day in what will always seem to me to be Charlie's office. Big shoes to fill, of course, really impossible. But since I so strongly believe in what Charlie accomplished in the Honors College, it is also an exciting opportunity for me to continue what Charlie had going here, to build on it, and to try to move forward, guided by his vision of Honors at the University of Maine. Since my experience in Honors before suddenly having this job thrust on me was as a preceptor in HON 211 and 212, I have been particularly excited to be working on the Civilizations sequence. Our four semester-long interdisciplinary course sequence for first- and second-year Honors students is unique in the US Honors community. It is longer than others, more inclusive, and special for its inclusion of scientists and science texts in a substantial and meaningful way \u2014 an aspect of the courses that was very important to Charlie. We have a great group of veteran preceptors who lead the discussions in our highly unusually limited enrollment (no more than 14 students per class) pre - ceptorials, along with some new preceptors who are bringing energy and knowl - edge to their classes. As I keep telling them, I envy the preceptors (this year I am not teaching) when I hear them chatting about discussions of Frankenstein or Darwin. There is always something deeply gratifying for the preceptor when thirteen or fourteen Honors first- or second-year students are engaged in seri - ous, thoughtful consideration of important works that have shaped our world. In this issue of MINERVA you will read about other exciting things happening in the Honors College. 2012 has been another great year as our students continue to impress and excel, winning awards, breaking new ground in important re - search, and adding so much value to the Honors community at UMaine. Many of our students have even traveled the world and left their mark! At the same time, our faculty push us to challenge our students and themselves to think big - ger and broader about what \"Honors\" means to UMaine. And nationally, our institutional peers continue to look to us for guidance. There is much more I could say about my whirlwind experience as \"dean for a year.\" A national search for Charlie's successor is underway as I write, and I am confident we will have a fine new dean in place next fall. And I will be back in the trenches as a preceptor, loving every minute.

In fact, Charlie loved all kinds of bright colors, but his signature attire was a pink button-up shirt with khaki shorts or khaki pants, san - dals (or crocs), and a baseball cap (which he was always leaving around campus after meetings). The 2012 edition of Minerva is themed in pink in honor of Charlie. As Editor of Minerva for the past six years, this is the first edition I have completed without Charlie's guidance and keen eye for editing. Hopefully, I have learned enough over the years that you won't notice the difference! This year's Minerva presented a unique challenge: to prop - erly express the sadness of this immense loss, while simulta - neously celebrating where we are and the incredible mo - mentum we have as a college looking to a bright future. By focusing on the impact Charlie had over the years and how he built a foundation that will propel Honors forward, I hope we have managed to strike the right balance. Two events occurred following Charlie's death that can not be effectively captured in this magazine: First, within hours of the news, former Honors students were posting messages and rememberances on Facebook. One Honors grad, Kris Kuhns '10, created an event called Fill the Steins to Charlie Slavin and set it for 10pm on Thurs - day, 2 August 2012. RSVPs began pouring in from around the world. Hundreds of people around the globe honored Charlie that night, and you can view some of the photos that were submitted on the back cover of this magazine. Second, on 14 September 2012, more than 700 mem - bers of the UMaine community \u2014students, faculty, staff \u2014as well as Charlie's familiy and friends gathered at the Collins Center for the Arts to remember him and his impact on so many lives. Speakers included UMaine President Paul Fer - guson, Provost Susan Hunter, Barbara Ouellette, Charlie's best friend Bob Franzosa, me, Charlie's sister in law, Terri Perelman-Hall, and his son, Matt Westhoven. In addition to the touching remarks, the evening included a fun video of photos over the years, and an incredible rendition of \"Halle - lujah\" performaned by UMaine's female a cappella group, Renaissance. The entire event was recorded and can be seen at www.honors.umaine.edu/celebrating-charlie. I hope you enjoy Minerva 2012 and the story it shares, not just about Charlie, but about how far we have come as a college and as a community of scholars, and how much we have to look forward to as we begin a new chapter of Honors at UMaine. Emily NCHC Remembers Charlie Over the course of Charlie's fifteen years as Director, then Dean of the Honors College at UMaine he was incredibly involved with the National Collegiate Honors Council, the pro - fessional association for honors programs and colleges. Charlie served on the Executive Board of the NCHC, led professional development pro - grams for new Directors and Deans, wrote for the NCHC Journal, and visited other colleges and universities as a consultant over the years. Without question, one of Charlie's favorite times each fall was taking a large group of stu - dents (thanks to the generosity of Betsy & Bill Leitch!) to the annual NCHC Conference. Over the years, Charlie took students to Orlando, FL, Washington, DC, Chicago, IL, Salt Lake City, UT, New Orleans, LA, St. Louis, MO, Philadelphia, PA, Denver, CO, San Antonio, TX, Kansas City, MO, and Phoenix, AZ. The conference is a chance for our students to present their research, and for the Honors College to share our successes with peer institutions, and to pick up new ideas to use at UMaine. Charlie would always return with a small notebook full of ideas he had borrowed from his colleagues, all focused on how to improve and expand oppor - tunities for Honors students at UMaine. At the 2012 conference in Boston, MA, Char - lie was recognized posthumously as an NCHC Fellow. While Charlie would have hated being recognized, he would love to know that he was honored alongside some of his favorite Honors Directors and Deans from around the country. UMaine students, faculty, and staff were on hand in Boston during the conference to accept the award on Charlie's behalf. 2012 M inerv a5 In the early 1950s, a very famous journalist, Edward R. Murrow, produced a series of short essays for CBS News entitled This I Believe . If you are an NPR/Public Radio junkie like I am, you know NPR revived that series between 2005 and 2009. They invited people, famous or not, to write about what they believe. Today, I'd like to share with you what \"I Believe\" about you and the Honors College: I believe that you are embarking on an educational opportunity that is unsurpassed anywhere. The interdisciplinary cur - riculum and experiences provided by the Honors College coupled with the ability to work closely with outstanding faculty members in your major disciplines produces a tremendously rich education. Of course, you have to be an active participant; this is not an opportunity that benefits a passive observer. Over your time in Honors you will be exposed to ideas, perspectives, and ways of thinking that may be strange or foreign to you. I encourage you to engage them\u2014don't shy away, don't reject them out of hand, don't accept them because they're stated by someone with \"authority,\" but rather ENGAGE them - weigh them, consider them, analyze them, and evaluate them. Give them the consideration that you would like people to give to your ideas and perspectives - and allow your - selves to grow through that process. I believe success in Honors, or at UMaine, requires dedication, hard work, and making good choices. There's nothing wrong with that. All of you need to develop good academic habits and employ them from the first day of classes. Don't wait until you're underwater - at that point, it's too late. Being smart is not something to be ashamed of; doing well in college is good (as, of course, is having fun). And they are certainly not mutually exclusive. Will you occasionally have to choose between playing and studying? Sure. Make your decisions wisely, and you won't have to always choose studying! These academic habits I'm talking about, particularly for Honors, are pretty straightforward. Let me emphasize three : Attend your classes \u2014both your preceptorials and the weekly lectures. Sure, this is a requirement and an expectation of the College, but that's not all. There is always something to learn, from your peers and from faculty members\u2014take advan - tage of these opportunities! I'm fairly certain that there will be Honors lectures that don't engage your interest, but I'm also fairly certain that those lectures, like the ones that do excite you, will be important to attend. This is part of the hard work. Do the assigned reading\u2014 yes, I know it seems as if there is a ton of reading assigned in Honors. And, yes, I know, you will hear students say \"Oh, I didn't do the reading and I did fine.\" I'm not here to debate that assertion; in fact, I'm pretty sure that has happened. So what? The plan here is to engage in these courses and with the assigned texts - to do that you have to do the reading. If the goal was seeking meaningless good grades, why bother? Explore the possibilities\u2014 the heart of an Honors education is intellectual risk taking. The Honors core curriculum is a broad, multi-disciplinary trajectory and it will take all of you into areas that will challenge your abilities (and probably your interests). Indeed, that's the challenge we put before you: for the English majors to struggle with quantum mechanics while the engineers struggle with Virginia Woolf. I truly hope these experiences will open up a world of possibilities for you to explore. And perhaps find some new passions. I believe respect is at the heart of success in education (and perhaps in every other endeavor). If you treat your faculty members and peers with respect, you will have a much easier go of it. Most importantly, they will treat you with respect as well. So, attend classes, be punctual, do the assigned work on time, learn to listen and not interrupt your classmates\u2014all of those are good things. Read your email and respond in a reasonable amount of time\u2014it's okay if your primary means of communication is text or Facebook, but it's also respectful to respond to requests and act on information you receive from your instructors and even administrators, like me. Oh, and turn on the automatic spell check in email - why wouldn't you? You also might ask, if they don't tell you, how your instructors would like to be addressed. I prefer, \"Charlie.\" I don't feel disrespected, but I appreciate that some might. My own sense is that actions and behavior, more so than titles, lead to respect. I encourage you all to keep the idea of respect in the forefront of your thoughts. Arguably the most important aspect of respect in a University setting is a commitment to academic integrity. Cheating, plagiarizing, or fabricating in your schoolwork is disrespectful of your peers, your instructors, the University, the intellectu - al work of others, and our society. If you are unclear about this, talk with your Honors preceptor or a member of the Honors College staff. Engaging in any of these behaviors intentionally is completely unacceptable. I believe the Honors College provides tremendous opportunities in and out of the classroom. I hope you will take ad - vantage of them. Get involved and bring your friends. Come chat with me, just for fun. Chat with our staff. Chat with your preceptors. Find out what's going on and jump in. It's a great way to connect, and can lead to additional opportunities down the road. You never know! I believe and hope that all of you can join me at the Honors Celebration in four years where we recognize your graduation with Honors! Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure that won't happen. However, I do know that it could happen. All of you have the talent and ability to post excellent grades, write a first-rate thesis, and graduate with Honors. We wouldn't have invited and accepted you into the Honors College otherwise. The choice truly is in your hands. If you work hard, treat others with respect, and become engaged in your education, there is no reason you can't be there that day to receive your medallion, your stein, and your entry into a distinguished group of very special graduates of UMaine. Now you know some of what I believe. I hope you believe much of this, too. I also believe that I have the best job on campus - because my job is pretty much dedicated to supporting you in your academic endeavors. Don't be afraid to let me know if there is something I can do to help or if you just want to chat about a question or a concern. This I believe... In the words of Charlie SlavinEach August, Charlie welcomed new students with a lecture that, unlike most \"Charlie talks,\" had a more serious tone. In his own words, here is Charlie's best advice for success at UMaine as an Honors student. Words to live by, in fact.

It has grown exponentially. It is now a College. It is now a com - munity of learning with a residential component; it has a structure to facilitate faculty/student research and so much more. Building Honors was not an exercise in empire building. Every program, every aspect is generated by Charlie's vision of the Honors journey. All has grown out of Charlie Slavin the teacher and his commitment to students and teachers alike having an environment in which they can continue their journey. Charlie Slavin is the finest teacher I have ever known. His physical passing leaves a tremendous hole. But his legacy and spirit live on in a multitude of places and a multitude of hearts, including mine.

Minerv a 20128ho n o r s ne w s Celeste Lozier was named one of two recipients of the George J. Mitchell Peace Scholarship for 2011-2012. Celeste is an Honors student majoring in English, with a concentration in Technical/Professional Writing. The scholarship, named after former US Senator from Maine George J. Mitchell, who brokered the peace accord between Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom in 1998, funds a student exchange program between Maine and Ireland at the University and Technical College level. During the 2012 spring semester, Celeste attended the University College Cork of the National University of Ireland. In Ireland, Celeste continued her degree track in English, with a focus on the Gaelic literature tradition. Before going, Celeste said, \"One of my goals is to take full advantage of a five month immersion in a different culture by learning, seeing and experiencing as much as is feasible. I will be in communication with the University of Maine while overseas in the form of a blog and perhaps other forms of updates.\"UMaine Honors Students Theo Koboski '14 (left) and Alex Jensen '13 (right) are recipients of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association's 2012 Ernest F. Hollings Un - dergraduate Scholarship Program. This scholarship consists of two separate $8,000 scholarships (one given for junior year and one given for senior year) as well as a ten week paid in - ternship at the NOAA facility of the student's choice. Both students are Marine Science majors. UMaine Honors student Erin Victoria Carter has won a scholarship from the Bar - ry M. Goldwater Foundation. Carter, who is majoring in biochemistry and mo - lecular/cellular biology, hopes to earn a doctoral degree in immunology or molecu - lar biology, and her career goal is to conduct AIDS or autoimmune disease research for a university or other research facility. There were 282 Goldwater scholarships awarded nationwide for the 2012-2013 academic year. The purpose of the foundation is to provide a continuing source of highly qualified scientists, mathematicians and engineers by awarding scholarships to college students who intend to pursue careers in these fields. The students, faculty, staff, and graduates of the Honors College never cease to amaze us with their dedication to taking intellectual risks, to building community, and to carrying on the Honors College tradition of excellence. Erin Carter '13 Earns Goldwater Recognition Two Honors Students Awarded Hollings Scholarships Celeste Lozier '14 Awarded George J. Mitchell Peace Scholarship Celeste's semester in Ireland also provided opportunities to further her current research at the University of Maine. Celeste is involved in research focused on Maine's creation of a deepwater offshore wind power industry. She says, \"My work in this area of energy produc - tion will be complemented by my international location, as Europe is the global leader in offshore wind, with close to 1250 turbines in the water spread across 49 wind farms in 9 different European coun - tries.\" Working with advisor Damon Hall, they are analyzing public outreach data to better inform developers and agencies in Maine as to how to best introduce this new industry into established commu - nities and economies. Celeste's future goals involve continuing to develop her writing abilities so as to facilitate communication between academia and public policy. 2012 M inerv a9Paige Martin '13 is this year's winner of the Car - olyn E. Reed Honors Thesis Fellowship. Paige, who hopes to become a physician, is pursuing a thesis titled The Effect of Cataract Surgery on Depres - sion and Vision-Related Quality of Life in an Elderly Population (advisor: K. Lira Yoon, psychology). By combining real-life clinical experience working in a Maine opthalmologist's office with research in psy - chology, Paige hopes to explore and understand both the physical and mental health elements of treating patients. The Reed fellowship is award - ed annually and Fellows receive a stipend of up to $2,500 to support their the - sis work. Honors student Margaret \"Maggie\" Burns is the 2012 recipient of the undergraduate-lev - el Edith Patch Award. The Award, named for the first woman scientist at UMaine, is given to grad - uate and undergraduate women to acknowledge their work on campus and in recognition of their promise for future contributions to the fields of sci - ence, agriculture, engineering, or environmental education. Awardees receive an honorarium, and are invited to present about their work at the Annu - al Earth Day Reception in honor of Dr. Edith Marion Patch. Maggie now attends the University of Colora - do at Boulder for graduate school. Honors College preceptor Melissa Ladenheim is one of three faculty members in Maine awarded the Donald Harward Faculty Award for Service-Learn - ing Excellence from the Maine Campus Compact. This coalition of 18 member campuses in Maine, annual - ly selects recipients who use service-learning and/or community action as an innovative teaching tool to engage students in civic learning. Melissa argues that the point of service learning, \"... is to not only move learning beyond the conventional classroom and augment the resources and capacity of community partners, but also to inculcate in students the value and benefits of being an engaged citizen.\" Melissa was recognized for her numerous initiatives that advocate service-learning and community action on campus and in the local community. She developed and taught HON 319 Justice or Charity: Community Ser - vice in Theory and Practice which involved scholarly study and real-world experience at Crossroads Res - rouce Center in Old Town. Melissa has worked with others to develop a Citizen Scholar Initiative within the Honors College, is part of CERTS (Community Engaged Research, Teaching and Service) at UMaine, and has engaged in developing partnerships with community organizations such as the Islamic Center of Maine, and continues to spread the word about ser - vice learning through presentations at National Colle - giate Honors Council conferences. The Maine IDeA Network for Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE) is an NCRR/ NIH supported network of thirteen Maine institutions with an overall goal of strengthening Maine's capacity to conduct NIH-competitive biomedical research. Seven Honors students (and their advisors) have been selected to receive INBRE Func - tional Genomics Thesis Fellowships, year: Justin Bolinger (Keith Hutchison), Anna Burgess (Clarissa Henry), Erin Carter (Rob - ert Wheeler) , Siobhan Cusack (Benildo de los Reyes), Erica Hidu (Robert Wheeler) , Recognizing Excellence in Functional Genomics Honors Students Funded for Research as Undergraduates Jennifer MacDowell (Alireza Sarvestani and Sharon Ashworth), and Alejandro Velez (Julie Gosse). Additionally, Honors student Joshua Jones was awarded a $1000 INBRE Functional Genomics Junior Year Research Award. Preceptor Melissa Ladenheim Recognized for Leadership in Service Learning Edith Patch Award: Maggie Burns 201210Amy Foley's interest in regenerative medicine began while doing her 2010 Honors thesis research studying microgravity's effect on cell development. This interest carried her to The University of California, San Francisco where she has been work - ing as a Stem Cell Biochemist investigating heart regeneration for over two years. In Spring 2012, Amy's research paper was published in the journal Nature about a new technology discovered to reverse the cardiac damage caused by a heart attack. The heart is primarily composed of two cell types: cardiac fibroblast, which are non-contractile cells that act as a skeleton to the heart, and cardiomyocytes, which are the contractile muscle cells that pump the blood. During a heart attack, cardiomocytes are killed, dramatically reducing the heart's functionality and causing premature death to the individual. Amy's research was an in vivo mouse study consisting of injecting three genes (small DNA pieces) into the heart after simulating a heart attack. These genes were able to \"reprogram\" a cardiac fibroblast into a functioning cardiomyocyte, returning the heart to nearly full functionality and reversing the damage. This research was awarded a five million dollar grant from the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine to continue the research in pigs, the next step towards FDA approval for human application.

Starting in 2013, the Honors College will be hosting monthly Brown Bag Lunches, which will provide an in - formal setting for students and faculty to discuss a wide range of honors related topics outside of the classroom. The Student Advisory Board, under the leadership of the Associates, will also host events highlighting Honors fac - ulty members. The first event will feature David Gross, the Interim Dean. Once again, the goal is to provide an informal atmosphere where faculty members can share their stories and experiences with students. From weekly battles with the Neville 101 sound system to saving thesis writers from the perils of pro - crastination and missed deadlines, the 2012-2013 Honors Associates are doing their best to protect and serve the faculty, staff, and students of the Honors College. This dynamic duo balances the forces of the sciences and humanities, as Bre Bennett '12 recently graduated with a degree in Biochemistry and Sam Paradis '12 with a degree in History and Theatre. Despite their disparate disciplines, the Associates stand united by their childhoods in Maine and their mutual enjoyment of The Office . Outside of the realm of the Honors College, Bre enjoys spending her spare time outdoors, preferably on mountains and set to the tune of The Decemberists, while Sam enjoys running and biking, as well as stage managing various theatre pro - ductions. However, never fear, because when there is an Honors College cry for help, the Associates waste no time in leaving the comforts of Holmes hall to dart down the fire escape and assist in any way possible. The Associates' latest mission involves further developing the Honors College community. With the loss of our beloved dean, Charlie, this idea of having a strong Honors community seems even more invaluable. There are two projects underway that they hope will bring faculty, staff, and students together. www.honors.umaine.edu/community 2012 M inerv a11 Honors College Featured Prominently in UMaine Strategic Planbl u e sk y Pl a n www.umaine.edu/blueskyplan University of Maine President Paul Ferguson has officially released a strategic plan that creates a blueprint for the state's flagship public university to become one of the most distinctive universities in the country for student achieve - ment and community engagement. The plan, The Blue Sky Project: Reaffirming Public Higher Edu - cation at Maine's Flagship University , was accepted by the Uni - versity of Maine System trustees over the summer. \"This plan isn't just about making the University of Maine a bigger, better and more financially sustainable institution,\" says Ferguson. \"It also is about reconnecting the university to the people of Maine so that we can have a major impact on the future growth and prosperity of our state in the 21st century.\" The plan is centered around investing in UMaine's existing areas of distinction and launching a number of new initiatives to better align the university's resources and programs with the needs of the state. It outlines five strategic pathways, sum - marized as the \"Five M's,\" and a series of related initiatives and strategies to transform UMaine in the next five years: Pathway #1 - Maine's Renewal \u2014Ensure that UMaine teaching, research, outreach, workforce & economic development program excellence are in close alignment with Maine's priority needs. Pathway #2 - Money and Management \u2014Optimize operating efficiencies & control ex - penditures within a financially sustainable business model, and seek new & entre - preneurial revenue sources. Pathway #3 - Morale & Marketing \u2014Invest in faculty & staff professional development, refresh the UMaine brand & improve communication among all constituencies. Pathway #4 - Mentoring and Modeling \u2014Promote undergraduate & graduate oppor - tunities for student success, including value-added residential life, research fellow - ships, internships, & more effective advising & learning environments. Pathway #5 - Master Plan and Maintenance \u2014Restore & create UMaine's physical plant and technology infrastructure to ensure a vibrant place of learning & discovery. The Honors College, which has been a key element of UMaine's academic and community fabric since 1935, is mentioned in Blue Sky several times. Specifically, as one of the \"highly impacting opportunities for promoting student leadership at UMaine\" (p.18), and under Pathway 4, it is explicitly stated that \"we will strengthen our signature Honors College\" (p.31), and a stated initiative, \"Continue to develop the unique quality of the Honors College as an unparalleled 'value added' UMaine undergraduate experience\" (p.32). Interim Honors Dean David Gross is excited about the opportunity. \"Our community of motivated students, faculty, and staff is ready to make Blue Sky a success. The Honors College has a daily focus on undergraduate research, interdisciplinary teaching and learning, and critically engaging students and faculty in extraordinary ways. Blue Sky is a chance to take that to a new level while maintaining quality and excellence.\" Ferguson, who came to UMaine in July 2011 and was formally inaugurated as the 19th president this past April, began the \"Blue Sky\" project shortly after arriving on campus. \"This has been a comprehensive, inclusive process that has united the entire University community around a renewed sense of pride, purpose and com - mitment to serving the people of Maine,\" Ferguson says. \"There is much work to be done, but we see blue skies ahead for this great University and the State of Maine.\" President Ferguson speaks at the 2012 CUGR Showcase Minerv a 201212 aCaDe m i Cs What is the What, by Dave Eggers, tells the tale of Valentino Achak Deng, a lost boy from Southern Sudan. Valentino was forced to flee his homeland at a young age. His harrowing journey through Sudan, Ethi - opia and Kenya eventually led him to the United States where he connected with Dave Eggers to share his story. The students who selected this book felt that one of the greatest challenges it presented was the idea of truth. While Valentino is a real person with a real story, language barriers led him to narrate his story to Eggers, who admits to rearrang - ing events in order to better portray what he saw as the ultimate truth of Valentino's story. In their first Honors lecture, the class of 2016 had the opportunity to speak with Aruna Kenyi, a local \"lost boy\" currently living in Portland. Aruna was able to meet Valentino and Dave Eggers at The Telling Room in Portland and was inspired to write his own memoir, Between Two Rivers, chronicling his journey to the US. Before the lecture, our first-year students were given the opportunity to meet with Aruna (pictured here with Elizabeth Wood). In the lecture, Aruna shared his journey and talked about the Sudanese School Lunch Program he has been working on in Maine. He then gave our students time to ask questions about growing up in a region of conflict, fleeing from home, and moving to a foreign land. His responses, while informative, were mixed with humor and provided a special perspective on the Honors Read. Honors Read 2012 CUGR enjoyed another successful school year in 2011-2012. CUGR was awarded a Presidential Requests for Visions of University Excellence (PRE-VUE) grant to support \"Enhancing Undergraduate Academic Experiences through Student-Faculty Research Collabora - tions.\" Through grants, students are provided the opportunity to ap - ply for research funds, including stipends and travel/supplies costs. Faculty apply to become CUGR Fellows, who are trained in under - graduate research mentoring. In other exciting news, CUGR again hosted the annual Undergradu - ate Research and Academic Showcase where over 100 undergraduates presented research in exhibits, oral presentations and poster formats. A wide variety of academic programs were represented by these stu - dent-scholars, including education, new media, engineering, animal and veterinary sciences, biology, psychology and marine sciences. The Honors College had its largest number of participants ever, with prizes being awarded to several students, inlcuding: Haley Richardson ( Classroom Realities: Tra - ditionally and Alternatively Certified Secondary Science Teachers' Preparedness to Teach Students with Disabilities); Breana Bennett Bergeron ( Imagining a Better World: A Study of Imagined In - tergroup Contact); Justin Bollinger, Colleen Buckless, Gabriel Vachon, Paige Miles, Jordan Gagne ( A Study of Changes in Gene Expression During Limb Regeneration). CUGR offered, for the first time, a new graduate course on research mento - ring. Taught by Professor Mike Kinnison, the class was a huge success, attesting to the importance of the \"generational\" nature of mentoring, with faculty mentoring both graduate and undergraduate students, and graduate students providing sig - nificant support to undergraduate students. 2012 M inerv a13The question of why I teach in the Honors College is actually one that I think about and get asked quite a bit. There are many reasons, but in the interest of parsimony I will offer the big three. The first is because I am a fervent believer in and defender of the value of a liberal arts education. In my view, one cannot be considered truly educated unless she or he has been exposed to, done work in, and thought critically about the arts, the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural sciences. The Honors Civilizations course sequence thrusts students into each of these four areas, and forces them to think deeply and critically. I am forced to do the same. For me, this is a truly rewarding experience. The second reason I teach in Honors is a desire to get out of my academic comfort zone. I am a political sci - entist, and I truly love what I do. But sometimes it is refreshing to engage material where I have no expertise whatsoever, no preconceived notions or biases. Many of the texts we read/listen to/view in Honors are texts that I had not even thought about since my undergraduate days, or even high school. I enjoy reacting to these texts and interacting with my students as they react as well. The final reason I teach in Honors is Charlie Slavin, the dear friend that many of us miss so much. Charlie was one of the people with whom I interviewed when I visited the UMaine campus as a job applicant, and his en - thusiasm struck me immediately. I realized quickly that he had something pretty cool going on in Honors, and that if I came to UMaine I wanted to be a part of it. Charlie wrote a letter for me when I came up for tenure and was one of the first people to congratulate me when it was announced that I had been successful in this regard. In that same conversation he asked if I was ready to start teaching regularly in the Civilizations sequence. I said yes, and I have never regretted it. I have taught Honors 111 each fall semester since becoming a part of the University of Maine community in 2008. That first fall my little girl was born. The third spring I completed my Ph.D. in English literature. These two events seem utterly unrelated\u2014and indeed, some might say, almost incompatible, given the extensive time required for both babies and dissertations. But engaging in these two very different kinds of work brought together different aspects of my personality. That is, I learned that seemingly competing values and ways of being and living were not actually at odds\u2014and when they were at odds, I learned new approaches to the problems I faced. The Honors curriculum asks students to occupy a similarly uncomfortable zone, both by drawing together students from a wide range of disciplines and by expanding the notion of a \"Great Books\" course to include seminal scientific and mathematical texts. Students encounter questions and lines of inquiry that draw from multiple disciplines, often before becoming a student of a particular discipline. I enjoy helping students navigate the new spaces that Honors 111 creates, for both critical engagement with difficult texts and for self-reflection and personal growth. While I teach Honors for multiple reasons, such as the small class sizes and the space this course creates for students to learn from each other, all my reasons stem from what Honors fundamentally does at a base level. The curriculum historicizes ways of being and living in the world, teaches students to think critically about what it means to create knowledge, and prepares students to create bridges between seemingly disparate aspects of their coursework and even their lives. This curriculum teaches me how to be a better teacher to students outside my own field of study, as do my students .

Stanhope Study Abroad Fellow musings from Amman, Jordan ously happy I had forgotten it as the man and I got deeper into conversation. I realized that having a camera would have changed the expe - rience I had with the driver, as a camera would have made me a tourist, rather than someone who lives here. I certainly did not have expectations of com - ing with cameras blazing, flashing people's eyes and temporarily blinding them, but I had not realized quite how discrete I wanted to be in or - der not to alienate myself as well as others. Eventually, we were driving through areas that were completely barren, except for the occa - sional short and thick palm tree. I was reminded of the long stretches of I-95 which are north of Orono, where you don't see any signs of civili - zation, and how I am in a place totally different, but at the same time, in a way I can't put my finger on, familiar. I don't know where I want to end up, but the far - ther away I get, the more I see what I have in Maine. Through the good experiences and the bad, in the Hon - ors College as well as in Jordan, I've come out the other end with a clearer image of what is important to me, and more strength to pursue it. - Kyle Franklin '14 I am fortunate to live in Western Amman, the wealthier area in the capital city of Jordan. The Khalifa building is lo - cated on a particularly modern corner of University St., a short distance from the University of Jordan's main gate. The first floor has several businesses in it, and their signs are all in Arabic and English, or sometimes just English. While sitting under a large sign that said Gloria Jean's Coffees, I saw a Western Union ATM and a small electron - ics shop that sells the popular headphones Beats. The front of the Khalifa building is all glass, a strong contrast to the almost exclusively limestone buildings just several stories high that make up the city. I was waiting for a prearranged driver to arrive who would take me to the airport to find my luggage that arrived late. The driver arrived early and when I reached into my pocket to answer my buzzing phone, he was standing just behind me with his phone in hand and smiling. \"Are you ready to go?\" he asked me with his son tugging on his left arm. I guessed that his son was four or five years old. We went to his black, unmarked van and his son climbed up onto the middle seat, and I sat in the front passenger seat beside him. We went back down the road, passing a Burger King and a McDonalds before reaching the main gate of UJ and driving over the tunnel that is used by pedestrians to cross to the other side of the road from the University. Inside the tunnel are small vendors selling items like watches, belts, and cheap trinkets. As we were exiting the city, I started to see the poorer areas that I wasn't as familiar with and couldn't see when I had arrived a week earlier in the dead of night. The father was casually pointing to cars and signs and asking his son what they said, and his son would respond quietly with the make and model of the vehicle. The driver told me that he speaks English and he is trying to teach his son. Many of the natives here speak English. I have frequently met cab drivers who have worked in the U.S. but moved back and took up cab driving as a side job for some extra money, or else couldn't find a job, a monumental task here. None of them know of Vermont or Maine so far. As the buildings continued to thin out, I started noticing older, abandoned one story limestone houses. Some of them had fallen in on themselves. I saw one that had a decent sized palm tree protruding from the center of the faded red roof, and very sparse greenery around the house. The man and I chatted about where we were from originally and what it is like there. He told me he has been to the east coast, but did not recall Vermont or Maine. His son got up the nerve by half way through the ride to start saying short sentences to me in English, and with a proud smile. On the sides of the road I began to see tents with at least one hundred goats and sheep surrounding them. Sometimes the animals were sedentary but sometimes moving with visible dust clouds and a man shepherding them with a bow. I wished I had thought to bring my camera, especially when I began to see herds of camels, but I was simultane - 2012 M inerv a19It all started with the Honors College... Heidi Crosby '03 & Richard Becker '03 al u m n i & F r i e n Ds Oh yeah, and in the middle of all that, they got married! Richard and Heidi came to Honors for the engaging small classes and unique Honors community, they both found much more. Heidi describes the Colvin community as a big part of her Honors experience. She lived there her first year and then returned as an Resident Assistant her senior year. She attended \"Honors Teas\" with Charlie, and the NCHC Conferences in Chicago and Salt Lake City. Specifically she recalls Charlie hosting dinner at the House of Blues in Chicago. Heidi also credits writing and defending her honors the - sis as the beginning of her scientific career: \"It taught me how to read scientific papers and really think about what I was doing in the lab.\" Richard's favorite memories are of the people he shared Honors with. In particular he remembers trips to the annual NCHC Confer - ence and gatherings in Colvin and outside on the Estabrook lawn, yet there is one Honors memory that stands out. Five years after graduation Richard stopped by to see Charlie. \"Charlie recognized me immediately and welcomed me into his office where we had a brief chat. Without intending it, he gave me a lot of encouragement, and the conversation is one that I carry with me to this day.\" Honors, and Charlie, had a lasting impact on Heidi and Richard. Because of Honors, they met and started their journey together from traveling and seeing the world, to continuing their education and pursuing their goals. who is from Orono, met and started dating after the first week of classes. Their first date was a trip to the Jordan Observatory. After graduating from UMaine and the Honors College in 2003, Richard and Heidi moved to Wisconsin to earn their master's degrees at UW-Madison; Richard in geology, and Heidi in geomicrobiology. Today, Heidi is on the verge of completing her PhD in microbiology from UW-Madison and will start a new post - doctoral position in the microbiology department at the University of Washington. Richard took a break to teach and work for the National Park service in Alaska before returning to UW-Madison to work on his PhD in geology (estimated completion, 2014). The Honors College has a way of bringing people together and cre - ating life-long friendships through small classes and the living-learn - ing environment of Colvin Hall. But for Class of 2003 Honors graduates Richard Becker and Heidi Crosby, the Honors College was the start of something even more special\u2014a life - time of happiness, partnership, and academic exploration. Richard and Heidi lived across the hall on the third floor of Colvin Hall their first year at UMaine. It was the fall of 1999 and the first year Colvin was home to Honors housing. Rich - ard, a Union, ME native, and Heidi, Minerv a 201220The Honors College is, in many ways, still my home at the University of Maine. When my Associate posi - tion ended in 2010, I moved a short walk away to Stevens Hall and the Department of History. Currently, I am researching my dissertation project; examining the ways women defined domesticity through cookbooks, conduct manuals, sentimental literature, and lady's magazines in the United States and Canada during the first half of the nineteenth century. I am particularly interested in the ways these definitions forged and legitimat - ed a more significant public role for women in society. I also have an interest in the emerging field of digital humanities and co-founded the history graduate student blog, a place where students in the history graduate program share their research with a wider audience (umaine.edu/khronikos). The past two years have brought other milestones as well, including a re-dedication to distance running, leading to the completion of two marathons and many half marathons. In June 2012, I married my running partner and fellow historian, Joe Miller, in Northeast Harbor surrounded by our friends, family, and with our dog serving as ring bearer. Despite these changes, some things remain the same. Tuesday afternoons still find me at Honors lecture and sever - al times a week I make the short walk to Colvin Hall. Not just to visit with Barbara and Deb, but to facilitate discussion among bright, motivated first-year Honors students in my own Honors preceptorial. This experi - ence maintains my own enthusiasm in academia. As an Honors student and then an Associate, I hoped to one day have the opportunity to teach in Honors. I never imagined I the opportunity would come this quickly. The Honors College has made all the difference in my UMaine experience, and I am proud to continue to be a part of this institution and Charlie's legacy. Honors graduate and friend Carolyn E.Reed '72, MD, renowned cardiothoracic surgeon, educator, mentor and beloved oncolo - gist, died Nov. 16 after a short illness. She was 62. Carolyn earned a BA in Chemistry with Highest Honors from UMaine and was valedictorian of her class. She received her M.D. from the University of Rochester School of Medicine in 1977 and completed a general surgical residency at New York Hospital, Cor - nell Medical Center. She entered a surgical oncology fellowship at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and found her career in thoracic oncology and cardiothoracic surgery, which led her to the Medical University of South Carolina where she spent the remainder of her career. In 2003, Carolyn returned to UMaine for the first time to deliver the Distinguished Honors Graduate Lecture. Breaking the Glass Ceil - ing: Medicine and Beyond focused on her life, women in medicine, and how it is often \"lonely at the top.\" Carolyn generously supported the renovation of Colvin Hall, naming the Chemistry and Pre-Med - ical Honors Suite, and endowing the Carolyn E.

In the 1870s, a group of Swedish im - migrants settled in the then newly-formed State of Maine's Swedish Colony. They brought traditional Swedish customs, dress, food and language. While many of the oldest generation of Swedes in New Sweden know this older style of Swedish, the language was not read - ily passed down to their children or grandchildren. While English is spoken in daily life, the Swedish language still has a presence today and continues to mark Swedish identity in Maine's Swedish Colony. Future plans: Although the immediate future is somewhat undecid - ed, I know that eventually I would like to teach. I plan to work in a Maine school system, and after that I will likely be pursuing a Masters of Arts in Teaching degree, with an emphasis on Gifted and Talented education. Kaitlyn elaine anderson Anthropology Earth Sciences, Spanish Kennebunk, ME Kennebunk High School Transdiagnostic Factors: The Mediating Role of Rumination in Health Anxiety and Premenstrual Stress Advisor: Sandra Sigmon Thesis description: My thesis involved the study of rumination, which can be defined as the process of repetitive negative thinking, and its role in the development and maintenance of co-occurring psychological constructs. I used an archival data set which consisted of (N = 715) female undergraduate students who were attending the University of Maine. Regression and mediational analyses confirmed that rumination partially accounted for the co-occurrence of symp - toms in specific psychological health constructs, namely health anxi - ety and premenstrual distress. Future plans: I plan to take a year off from school to travel and work before attending graduate school in clinical psychology where I hope to earn my PhD. Eventually, I plan to conduct anxiety related re - search and also counsel individuals suffering from anxiety disorders.Kristina sKye anderson Psychology Old Town, ME Old Town High School Can Picture Books Aid in the Development of Visual Literacy?

For the purposes of the study \"visual literacy\" was defined as the ability to comprehend and create images and \"picture books\" consisted of illustrated children's literature. Seventeen art ed - ucators from the greater Bangor, ME area participated by answering questions concerning their use of picture books with art students. The findings, although limited by a small participant population, conclud - ed that the use of picture books in the art classroom is beneficial in the formation of visual literacy. The data also revealed that fifteen of the seventeen participants had previously, currently, or planned in the future to use picture books in their art classroom.

I also wrote an introduction to the set of translations which consisted of three parts: a section on translation theory and my own personal decisions as a translator; a section on the historical and social context of immigration to and from Spain; and a literary analysis of the original collection as a whole and the stories individually. Future plans: I plan to work for a few years, traveling as much as possible, before I return to graduate school.Karin eileen Baard English, Spanish Brunswick, ME Brunswick High School Minerv a 201224 The formation new blood ves - sels from preexisting blood vasculature, is a necessary biological pro - cess, but cancerous tumors exploit it for pathological purposes. Angio - genesis requires the directed migration of the endothelial cells lining the preexisting blood vessels. My thesis focused on directed endothe - lial cell migration in response to increasing concentrations of extracel - lular matrix (ECM) proteins, or haptotaxis. We created a preliminary, two-dimensional model to study the haptotactic motility of endothelial cells using a step change in concentration of the ECM protein fibronec - tin. We found that bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) exhibited directional motility towards the higher concentration side, and BAEC motility decreased on higher fibronectin concentrations. Future plans: My plans will involve meandering to the melodies of The Decemberists, and uniting my background in biochemis - try with my interest in food and agricultural sustainability.Breana e. Bennett Biochemistry Freedom, ME Mount View High School Imagine A Better World: The Effects of Imagined Intergroup Contact on Intergroup Attitudes Advisor: Jordan LaBouff Thesis description: A growing body of evidence indicates that interactions with outgroups positively influence attitudes towards those outgroups. This research investigates the effects of imagining intergroup contact with a Muslim person on implicit and explicit anti-Muslim prejudice among those who are most ideologically in - tolerant. Local and national participants were asked to complete a short imaginative exercise followed by a brief online questionnaire. Results indicate that imagined intergroup interaction was effective at improving attitudes towards Muslims even among those who were the most prejudiced and ideologically intolerant. Implications and potential practical applications, including diplomatic and educational initiatives, are discussed.

JaClyn lilias Bousquet Art Education Art History, Studio Art South Berwick, ME Marshwood High School Meaningful Contributions to Poverty Alleviation through Microfinance Advisor: Rick Borgman Thesis description: My thesis is a comparative analysis of Ban - gladesh's two most prominent Microfinance Institutions (MFI's), Grameen Bank and BRAC Bank. Microfinance helps those in abject poverty lift themselves to solvency and beyond. This simple and ef - fective, economic strategy has globally impacted millions of families. Each MFI has effective and ineffective and/or potentially harmful el - ements. This thesis seeks to isolate those elements which hinder bor - rower outreach potential and MFI operational viability. Alternative suggestions for best practices are offered so that these MFIs might gain efficiency and allow them to increase outreach efforts and remain operationally viable over the long run. Future plans: I am living in Bangladesh and working as a Fulbright Fellow on poverty alleviation through microfinance. I plan to earn my PhD and seek a career in economic development. raChel a.

To supporters, FGC is a legitimate, cultural - ly approved rite of passage that is steeped in tradition. Opponents of female genital cutting emphasize the practice is a ritualized form of violence and a detriment to women's health. My thesis provided a cross-cultural overview of the debate, including justification for the continued practice, and those advocating its cessation, and formulated a culturally sensitive plan of action for the eradication of FGC. Ulti - mately, I assert that FGC is genital mutilation and a violation of basic human rights. Future plans: I plan to earn a joint Masters in Medical Anthropol - ogy focusing on immigrants and women, and a medical degree in Emergency Medicine or Infectious Disease.

Although the oyster secretes new shell material over the burrows, the resulting blisters are unsightly and decrease the market value of the oyster. Proposed methods used to eradicate the worm can be ex - pensive, toxic, or unreliable. I investigated the salinity tolerance of P . websteri outside the oyster shell and the efficacy of salinity-based treatments for the worm inside the shell. My results indicate that P. websteri is intolerant to freshwater and when a freshwater soak is combined with dry storage, 100% of worms die within 10 days with little oyster mortality. Future plans: I plan to earn a master's degree in Marine Science and hope someday to work with a government or environmental agency doing marine research and community outreach.shannon whitney Brown Marine Sciences (Marine Biology) Lake Peekskill, NY Putnam Valley High School The Hydrological and Geochemical Role of the C Horizon in a Glacial Till Mantled Headwater Catchment Advisor: Ivan Fernandez Thesis description: The C horizon is the deepest soil layer that is typically unweathered. My thesis looked at the role of the C horizon in the watershed hydrologic cycle. Results indicate that the C horizon is hydrologically active and is contributing to water flow paths. Due to its contribution to water flow paths, the boundary between the B and C horizons is much less defined than previously expected. Results suggest that C horizon weathering is heterogeneous with no appar - ent patterns with depth or across the watershed. Characterizing water flow paths and chemistry is important to understanding issues such as contaminant transport and flood control. Future plans: This research was conducted at Hubbard Brook Ex - perimental Forest in Thornton, New Hampshire. I plan to continue my writing and research to ultimately publish with my advisors from Hubbard Brook. Margaret a. Burns Ecology & Environmental Sciences (Environmental Sciences) Berwick, ME Noble High School Development of Polymeric Porous Plastic Implant for use in Orthopedic Applications Advisor: David Neivandt Thesis description: My objective was to develop a means of cre - ating porous implants in a manner that is both quick and economical. The idea behind a porous implant is that in percutaneous applications it will facilitate soft tissue in-growth and create a biological seal, thus preventing infections. The method that was developed was to use a rapid prototype 3D printer to create porous plastic implants designed using CAD software. The implants were then tested for soft tissue in- growth capability in a small animal trial. Future plans: The summer after graduation I will be finishing up research projects I have going on. After that I plan on taking some time to travel and volunteer.alexander Caddell Biological Engineering Winterport, ME Hampden Academy Minerv a 201226 Comparative Analysis of Limb Regeneration Using High Throughput Gene Expression Data from Danio rerio and Ambystomqa mexicanum well-established model organisms used to study limb regeneration. Both follow similar mechanisms of healing upon amputation, so we hypothesized that a specific set of genes is conserved to enable regeneration. Using bioinformatics tech - niques and gene expression data, a small set of potentially interesting genes was discovered. These included genes and2, snai2 and cx43 of the zebrafish. The last is notable as it is significantly represented in both organisms and is a critical component of morphogenesis. It can thus be concluded that these gene expression analyses support our hypothesis of conserved molecular mechanism among regenerating organisms. Future plans: I plan to study bioinformatics and medicine.anne Catherine CaMpBell Chemistry Belfast, ME Belfast Area High School The Relationship Between Trauma & Language in the \"Young Child\" Advisor: Victoria S. Bennett-Armistead Thesis description: This literature review explores the relation - ship between non-directive play therapy and the way that children communicate their trauma. Available studies in the areas of filial and child-centered play therapy were examined. Several studies were found for each subcategory, including meta-analysis, case studies, and experimental data. It highlights commonalities through the presented data, as well as notes, deficiencies and areas for further and expanded research. The idea that play is a successful method of expression of trauma for children and can take the place of verbal description was a similar belief found in all methods. It was also discovered to be ben - eficial to combine therapy methods. Evidence was present in numer - ous studies for improved self-concept as well as a gain in the child's ability to form relationships. It is also made present that though many opinions exist on the subject; empirical data is difficult to come by.KaCi Caron Psychology (Abnormal/Social) Child Development & Family Relations, Legal Studies New Canada, ME Community High School Identification of Internal Parasites of Sheep and Goats Advisor: James Weber Thesis description: Abomasal worms are a major cause of small ruminant disease. Differentiation of the most pathogenic nematode, H. contortus , from the other common species can be difficult using standard diagnostic fecal flotation techniques because the ova are similar in size and morphology. Known pure culture H. contortus fecal samples from West Virginia University were used to develop morphologic assays using FITC-labeled lectin agglutination and im - munocytochemistry to identify species of abomasal worms. These assays were applied to assess disease due to abomasal worms on se - lected small ruminant farms in Maine. The diagnostic tests were used to test the hypothesis that H. contortus is the most common internal parasite found on sheep and goat farms in Maine.aManda lynn Chaney Animal & Veterinary Science (Pre-Veterinary) Searsport, ME Searsport District High School The Space Explorer Advisor: Gregory Howard Thesis description: We may pass through our lives thinking our surroundings have little effect on who we are. The Space Explorer is an anthology of creative short stories, poems, prose, and imitations. These writings explore the idea of space and how every exploration of it defines us. Whether it is landscape, memories, or what we didn't do, it introduces us to the space of identity. Ultimately, our spaces have shaped us into who we are and who we strive to be. The charac - ters in The Space Explorer have developed due to the catalyst of their surroundings. The setting of each writing has served as the vehicle for their actions. These characters are situated in locales such as: the American West, a small town in Appalachia, a farm in rural Canada, a forest in northern New England, and many more. Future plans: I hope to have my writing published, but until then I will utilize my dual-majors in order to obtain employment and ulti - mately I plan to earn a doctoral degree. raChel anne Carter Biology, English Richmond, ME Richmond High School 2012 M inerv a27 The Effects of Noise Disturbance on Zebra Finch Behavior; Does Disturbance Predictability Matter? Advisor: Rebecca Holberton Thesis description: The progress of human civilization has altered the natural landscape of the world in a range of ways, from merely aesthetic to irreparably destructive. One impact is increased and al - tered levels of background noise on the natural acoustic landscape, which can hinder species, such as songbirds, that rely on acoustic sig - nals as a vital part of many social processes. These impediments can increase stress levels and levels of predation, erode pair bonds, and decrease population survival in the acoustic environments we have created. While the effects of masking noise on various species of birds have been studied before, this is the first study designed to understand what effect the predictability of such noise disturbances may have on zebra finch ( Taeniopygia guttata ) behavior. The results point towards the predictability of the disturbance not having a significant effect on initiation or time spent vocalizing after the end of a disturbance block.Kathryn Cassidy Chenard Wildlife Ecology Rochester, NY Gates-Chili Senior High School Development of Pesticide Sensing Polyaniline Electrode through Detection of Alachlor by Cyclic Bruce Thesis description: Alachlor is a chlorinated herbicide used to kill broadleaf weeds that grow mainly in corn, peanuts, and soybeans. The purpose of this project was to develop an environmentally friend - ly sensor in the form of an electrode that will be able to detect alachlor in aqueous samples. The way this was done was by using an elec - trochemical instrumentation technique called cyclic voltammetry. Polyaniline, a conducting polymer, was grown on a platinum sub - strate and the resulting electrode was cycled in various concentrations of alachlor in aqueous buffered samples at pH 4. By monitoring the current produced from the polymer on the metal substrate, a change in the electrical current from interaction with the herbicide signaled its detection. Through additional instrumentation by SEM and FTIR it was suggested that a chemical reaction was responsible for the change in current produced by polyaniline.todd M. C onner Chemistry Camden, ME Camden Hills Regional High School The Role of the Economy in Presidential Elections Advisor: Richard Powell Thesis description: I compared the 1992 and 2004 United States presidential elections. My initial contention was that the economy is the decisive factor in presidential elections, but my research revealed otherwise. Despite two bad election year economies in 1992 and 2004, the results could not have been any more different. In 1992, George H. W. Bush was throttled in his reelection attempt and in 2004 George W. Bush was victorious. The thesis reveals what each incum - bent and challenger candidate did to lead to the discrepancy in results despite similar economies.

C ox Political Science Bangor, ME Bangor High School Optimization of a Fluorescent in situ Hybridization Protocol in the chlorotica takes up the algal chloroplasts into its digestive cells. They are not digested, but all other algal cellular materials are. Chloroplasts rely on nuclear genes for continued function and photosynthesis, and in E. chlorotica the chloroplasts do not have the necessary algal nuclear genes to con - tinue to function. I created fluorescently labeled DNA probes to target genes in E. chlorotica and optimized a procedure to perform fluo - rescent in situ hybridization. The probes bind to the genes they were designed to match, allowing visualization of where in a cell a gene is located. The development of this protocol will allow direct molecular investigation of horizontal gene transfer in E. chlorotica.

In utilizing current financial data, in - terviewing with individuals from Bangor Hydro Electric, and through research conducted, I concluded that it could potentially be in soci - ety's economic best interest to allow privately-owned electric utilities to issue tax-exempt securities in specific scenarios. In the long-term, this assessment may be useful in the determination of the most ef - ficient methods for public utility capital taxation. Infrastructure de - velopment is critical to the success and sustainability of a developed nation. Through sensitivity and scenario analysis I concluded that this option will be ideal for poorly structured and over-leveraged utilities and their issuance could be determined on a case-by-case basis.

JaCoB F. day Accounting (Finance) Byram, NJ Lenape Valley Regional High School An Assessment of the Egyptian Military and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in Connection to the Emergence Theory Advisor: Seth Singleton Thesis description: The thesis provides an in-depth analysis of the internal operations of the Egyptian military and the Islamic Rev - olutionary Guard Corps. In light of recent rebellions in Egypt and Iran, the thesis examines how the security, economic, and political role of these two institutions has led to Egypt's betrayal of President Mubarak, and the IRGC's loyalty to the Iranian leadership. The role of these two institutions will be investigated using Steven Johnson's Emergence Theory. In using Johnson's theory, this thesis will aim to uncover the function, performance, and system of two institutions that have become autonomous within their respective state.

From ad - vances in modern cell biology, we know that the development and function of a cell intrinsically depend partly on the stiffness of the substrate on which it grows, as well as the nature of the adhesive in - teraction between molecular ligands on the substrate surface and the cell surface. This thesis studies the influence of external environmen - tal conditions, namely substrate rigidity and adhesivity, on neural cell growth, most importantly the development and growth of the axon, the cellular extension by which neurons send information in the form of electrical impulses from cell to cell throughout the neural tissue. Future plans: I hope to publish this research before earning my Ph.D. at Columbia University in NYC. In life I plan to hike the Appa - lachian Trail and travel as much as possible. eBen grant estell Biological Engineering Monroe, ME Mount View High School Characteristics of Young Children's Longest Utterances Advisor: Allan B. Smith Thesis description: I proposed and examined a new measure of ex - pressive language development in young children. To determine the usefulness and validity of this measure, longest length of utterance (LLU), I conducted an in-depth analysis of language samples from interviews with three preschool-age participants. I examined LLU's correlation with established measures of child language abilities, the distribution of utterance lengths in each speech sample, the way LLU varies with the amount of language analyzed, and the conversational context of longest utterances. The results showed that LLU is an in - credibly variable measure, but may provide information about some aspects of expressive language ability not captured by other measures. Future plans: I will attend UMaine to earn a master's in Com - munication Sciences and Disorders. I hope to become a successful speech-language pathologist or researcher, have a family, and live on a lake in Maine.alise reBeCCa deMaris Communication Sciences & Disorders Child Development & Family Relations Big Lake Township, ME 2012 M inerv a29 Effects of Arsenic Trioxide on Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase in Wild Type Flies and Those Having the Serca Mutation Advisor: Harold Dowse Thesis description: The fact that long-term arsenic exposure can be detrimental to health has led to stringent regulations on the amount allowed in drinking water. Arsenic trioxide is a form of inorganic ar - senic known to cause cascade events in many cellular processes. Its specific target, the protein PML, makes it useful in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia. Recent studies have shown that this type of arsenic interferes with normal calcium concentrations within the cell. Calcium is integral in the proper functioning of the heart, and so we studied the effects of arsenic on the Drosophila heartbeat.

Kyle ettinger Biology Chemistry Camden, ME Camden Hills Regional High School A Study of the University of Maine's Use of Local Food Advisor: Mark Haggerty, Stephanie Welcomer Thesis description: My thesis examined the use of local food by the University of Maine. Motives for use of local food were determined by studying the stated University mission, and through interviews with university officials. Student perspectives on local food were studied through surveys. To determine what effect the Farm-to-Uni - versity program at the University of Maine is having, purchasing re - cords dating back to 2008 were examined. Survey results, purchasing records, and a comparison to standards set forth by the Healthy Food in Healthcare pledge, were used to determine the effectiveness of the program. After this analysis, recommendations for a more effective Farm-to-University program at the University of Maine are made. Future plans: I will enter the Management Program at Hannaford, and ultimately I plan to earn my law degree or MBA.andrea Joy Flannery Political Science Business Administration, Legal Studies Bourne, MA Bourne High School Guardians of Alyataus Advisor: Tina Passman Thesis description: My thesis is a young adult novel for those 12- 16 years old. It follows a boy through a wormhole, not unlike Alice in Wonderland , and into a new world. In this new world he faces many difficulties and challenges, however through all of this he comes to realize more and more about his moral self. This thesis follows Jo - seph Campbell's theory of a literary hero. It was also supplemented by around 40 art pieces, including two sculptures. Future plans: After graduation I am going back to Massachusetts. I am planning on attending Northeastern University for graduate school at the Bouve School of Health and Medicine. It is my hope that I will achieve a Masters of Science in Collegiate Student Devel - opment and Counseling.Kelsey Kristine Flynn Secondary Education (Social Studies) Mansfield, MA Mansfield High School A Study of the Coping Mechanisms Adopted by Work Groups to Deal with Project Structure Advisor: Niclas Erhardt Thesis description: I conducted a case study involving a local com - pany and two of their project-based initiative teams. I interviewed team members to explore how their team work was impacted by their project structure. One of the teams had a very unclear project structure and relied heavily on creativity. The other team was extremely struc - tured and relied on routines and efficiency. The object of the study was to identify ways that the team members adapted their behavior in order to still remain successful on the team, given the challenges that were presented by the project structure. I originally assumed that the teams would each adopt different adaptive behaviors or coping mech - anisms, but I found that each team gravitated towards a middle of the road approach, rather than favoring more or less structure.

I show that success or failure hinged on the ability of leaders to demonstrate determination, will - ingness to compromise, and a clear vision for the future. By placing leadership within the historical context of nuclear arms control, the enduring superiority of cooperation over competition and the pivotal role of personal character in leadership are made clear. This thesis illustrates how and why it is essential to take the role of leadership into consideration when studying foreign policy and national security. Future plans: I plan to study international security in graduate school and to work for a think tank, university, or the US military.BenJaMin allen Fox French, International Affairs (Political Science) Blue Hill, ME George Stevens Academy Coping and Gender Differences in Seasonality and Seasonal Affective Disorder Advisor: Sandra Sigmon Thesis description: I researched gender differences in prevalence rates of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), by studying coping strat - egies. Using archival data, the differences in how men and women cope with life stressors were compared. Specific coping strategies were examined to see if they were predictors of seasonality. Statis - tically significant differences between coping strategies used by men and women were found. In addition, predictors of seasonality were not consistent across gender. In one example, it was found that rumina - tion, or dwelling on thoughts and feelings, was a significant predictor of seasonality for women alone, and not men. With further research, these results could aid in identifying the cause for the staggering dif - ference in prevalence rates of SAD between men and women.

This hypothesis was named the \"Fear-Support Complex\" and was supported by my results. Children with low levels of social support and higher levels of fear possessed decreased mood and self-esteem. I also found that fear and depression have no direct correlation. Every childhood fear researched in this study was signifi - cantly correlated to fears found in late adolescence (ages 18-25). This correlation proves linkage between the two age groups and fear. For future research, I propose a longitudinal study of children, their fears, and socioemotional functioning from ages 5-25.

Design parameters were the rules and guide - lines of MATE international ROV competition (www.materover.org) as well as the practical considerations of operating in an underwater environment. I chose to focus on a new type of thruster called the bubble jet engine. I constructed a series of prototypes and performed tests using computerized data acquisition to asses the affect of varying nozzle geometries on thrust performance.

I examined the effects of losartan, an antifibrotic drug, on fibrogenesis and identified genomic loci that modify ALMS phenotypes in a mouse model. This work took place at The Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, ME. Histological and chemical analyses of mutant and control mice treated with losartan were initiated and losar - tan was observed to have altered some blood parameters. A genome wide screening identified two genetic modifiers in the ALMS mouse model. The results may help future therapeutic strategies, early detec - tion, and elucidation of disease progression in human ALMS patients.

By using maternal imagery, the movement was highly effective and resulted in the implementation of one of the most comprehensive chemical safety policies in the coun - try made by a state. I looked at the movement against BPA as being part of a continual effort towards environmental justice in all types of environments and examined it in terms of historical environmental justice movements by analyzing how social organizing has changed and remained the same over time.

Using 21 years (1985- 2005) of Maine Department of Marine Resources shellfish toxicity data, inter-annual variability in two metrics of annual toxicity, max - imum magnitude and integrated total annual toxicity are examined for relationships to a suite of environmental variables. Correlations between toxicity and two variables indicative of local weather, dew point and atmospheric pressure both suggest a link between increased toxicity and clearer skies/ drier air. As no correlation was evident be - tween toxicity and local precipitation, we hypothesize that the link is through light availability in this historically foggy patch of coast. Future plans: I will pursue a career in marine sciences education and plan to reach SCUBA dive master and dive instructor levels.hannah horeCKa Marine Science (Marine Biology) Spanish Benson, MN Benson Senior High School The Costs of Offshore Wind Energy Advisor: Gary Hunt Thesis description: I focused on the costs associated with deepwa - ter offshore wind energy development in the Gulf of Maine, where it is being looked into as a solution to emissions problems. I reviewed research by economists, developers, and university researchers. I ap - plied my own calculations on the cost of development and found that it is important to consider social and private costs. I found deepwater offshore wind energy will not be viable in coming years without a car - bon tax and a government subsidy. If no developers invest in a farm, learning curve effects will be stunted. This is key because the effect of learning-by-doing over time is crucial to decreasing costs. A carbon tax is also a critical aspect to make deepwater offshore wind compet - itive. With an aggressive pricing scheme, it is possible deepwater off - shore wind energy will become competitive in less than two decades. Future plans: I plan to move west to work at a ski mountain before attending law school and having a legal career in renewable energy.Caitlin howland Economics, Spanish Falmouth, ME Falmouth High School University Student Affairs: A Transnational Comparative Perspective Using Two Case Studies Advisor: Elizabeth Allan Thesis description: This thesis presents a comparison of the stu - dent affairs programs at the Universidad de las Americas Puebla and the University of Maine.

For comedy to be a potent criticism it is important for the audience to understand the context surrounding the sketch. Without understanding the context, the sketch still has the ability to be humorous, but the critique is hard - er to acknowledge. White Like Me as performed by Eddie Murphy on Saturday Night Live is used as an example for understanding the social criticisms presented in the sketch. It is descriptively analyzed by dissecting the three major jokes shown and then, to conclude the thesis, there is a discussion of the dangers of not understanding con - text in comedy.

Advisor: Paul Roscoe Thesis description: In 1996 the book War Before Civilization by anthropologist Lawrence Keeley was published and intended to de - bunk the myth that small-scale tribes and villages across the world were peaceful in the past. Keeley presented the idea that warfare in these societies was more lethal and had greater consequences than war in larger, modern states. Keeley believed that even if only one or two people were killed in a small tribe, this had a greater impact on their society because they had small populations. My thesis focused on the accuracy of the tables created by Keeley to show casualty rates. I de - termined that for fifteen of the total twenty societies Keeley used, his calculations, citations, and the sources were not reliable or accurate. There are several components that need to be reworked or removed from the tables in Keeley's text and my thesis presents this data.

That idea of balance has led to a reliance on he said/she said reporting that can misinform the public in its unwillingness to pursue the truth if it lies too far in one direction. I suggested that a greater emphasis on transparency in journalism and showing the origins of informa - tion could do a better job of informing the public. I suggested that hyperlinks can be used in online journalism to show the full text of documents or the full audio of an interview, for example, to provide a reader with the building blocks of an article and that doing so could help to discredit any accusations of bias that may be sparked by a finished article.

NAC has the ability to break down mucus and could be a valuable cleanser for the guttural pouch, where bacteria are harbored. NAC was tested using uterine tis - sues and compared to non-infused and saline-infused horses. Pictures of the tissues were recorded using endoscopy and were evaluated for signs of inflammation. Results show that saline and NAC infusions caused mild inflammation compared to non-infused horses. These re - sults indicate that NAC could be a low-risk treatment for horses after a Strangles outbreak, but future research is still needed.

I am considering a degree in international law as well and hope to travel extensively, no matter what my profession.Colin snyder KolMar International Affairs Saco, ME Thornton Academy Nameless, Inscutable, Unearthly: An Examination of Obsession in Moby Dick Advisor: Steve Evans Thesis description: In this project, I examine the operation of the sublime and the unconscious in Moby Dick . Through sublime experi - ences, Ahab and Ishmael confront the limits of human understanding. Employing Lacanian psychoanalytic theory, I compare the reactions of Ahab and Ishmael to the sublime, and how these reactions ulti - mately determine their fates. Future plans: I intend to take a year off to write, travel, and play music before attending graduate school to further my studies in lit - erary criticism. I would love to eventually travel abroad and earn my PhD.sarah Katherine lingo English Ecology & Environmental Science Youngstown, OH Greenbrier East High School Corruption in the Bulgarian Legal System Advisor: James Warhola Thesis description: This thesis is a thorough investigation of cor - ruption as it is manifested in the court, prosecutorial and investigatory services in Bulgaria. I was able to travel to Bulgaria during the course of my undergrad experience and this thesis is a result of my interest in the nation itself. Future plans: I am taking a year off to save some money and do some traveling. I will hopefully be headed to Law School in the Fall of 2013! Eventually, I hope to be practicing law in the Portland area.stephanie a. littlehale International Affairs (Political Science) Legal Studies Rockport, ME Georges Valley High School 2012 M inerv a35 Concussion Management, Education and Diagnosis in Eastern Maine High School Football Advisor: Chris Nightingale Thesis description: It is important for high schools to educate, di - agnose and manage concussions correctly to prevent the occurrence of catastrophic events. Through interviews and observations of prac - tices and games, three Eastern Maine high schools were assessed to evaluate their concussion policies. Administrators, coaches and med - ical personnel were interviewed for concussion awareness. Themes included: honesty; misconceptions; testing and connection; education; communication; changes in perspective over time; and Maine Principals' Association oversight. Based on the themes, recommendations and a conceptual framework for concussion management were developed to unify pol - icies throughout Eastern Maine high schools. Future plans: I plan to become a physician assistant and hope to expand on my research in proper concussion management.sarah Katharine loCKhart Athletic Training Cumberland, ME Greely High School The Role of Caveolin in the Toll-Like Receptor Signaling Pathway Advisor: Carol Kim Thesis description: Two key pathways of the immune system that play an integral role in establishing the antiviral state are the Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interferon receptor (IFNR). Viruses have evolved to evade this antiviral state. We found that one viral evasion mech - anism is disruption of cell membrane domains known as caveolae, which are implicated in disease processes like cancer and diabetes. Caveolae are vital in maintaining a structure from which molecules can signal. Previous studies show that viral infection depletes caveo - lin, leading to the dispersal of IFNR clusters and an impaired antiviral response. Through imaging we show colocalization of TLR9 and ca - veolin. By depleting caveolin, we get a dampened IFN induction via TLR9 upon exposure to ligand. Future plans: I will earn my master's degree in Microbiology at UMaine before attending medical school. I hope to ultimately run my own medical practice in Maine and continue performing research.riChard h. luC Biology, Microbiology Political Science Bangor, ME Bangor High School A Pilot Study on Differential Chromatic Contrast Discrimination Between Human Male and Female Advisor: Leonard Kass Thesis description: The purpose of this study was to quantitatively analyze the degree to which men and women discriminate contrast - ing colors. I posed the following questions: do women discriminate chromatic (red/green) color contrasts differently than men?; at which color intensities is it most difficult for women or men to discriminate colors?; and in what ways do background colors influence the diffi - culty for discriminating a foreground colored shape? For the female subjects, a general trend was consistent throughout both experiments. Women had more difficulty determining which side the open door was on at low SPIN values than men. Overall, women also showed that their response time in experiment one was slower than men. Future plans: I plan to work in scientific research in Nova Scotia before attending medical school to earn my MD/PhD to practice med - icine and clinical research.Kaitlyn MaCisaaC Biology Neuroscience Bedford, NS, Canada Charles P. Allen High School Heterogeneous Deformation of Gabbroic Rocks in the Grenville Province of Southern Ontario Advisor: Christopher Gerbi Thesis description: The mechanisms by which the deformation of rocks is localized are significant for the development of many land - forms and structures that occur on Earth. I have performed micro - structural analysis on an outcrop of rock from the Grenville province of southern Ontario which exhibits meter-scale strain localization and heterogeneous deformation. Given my results I have proposed mech - anisms by which these rocks have become locally weak allowing strain to localize. Future plans: I plan to pursue a master's degree in structural geolo - gy at the University of Massachusetts following graduation. Beyond that I will undertake further studies in geology depending on what career path I am interested in.Calvin andrew MaKo Earth Science South Deerfield, MA Frontier Regional High School Minerv a 201236 The Role of Traf2 in Zebrafish Advisor: Carol Kim Thesis description: I studied the innate immune system in ze - brafish, a model organism for both human disease and fish disease. I looked at the signaling protein Traf2 and the potential role it plays during a viral infection in the zebrafish. We found that eliminating Traf2 in the zebrafish decreased the survival of the zebrafish. We were not able to definitively determine the causative agent for the increase in mortality in the Traf2 knockdown zebrafish. I also explored the potential function of Traf2 in zebrafish as a ubiquitin ligase. The prin - cipals of signaling elucidated in this research has ramifications in pro - tecting farm fish from viral infections. Future plans: I am attending Tufts University School of Medicine to study for my MD. After residency I will practice medicine with the United States Air Force with the goal of eventually coming back to practice in the state of Maine.Bradie nelson Manion Biochemistry Chemistry Old Town, ME Old Town High School Transformation of Realism: Narrator's Function and the Blending of Dialogue and Stream of Consciousness in To the Lighthouse and Between the Acts Advisor: Carla Billitteri Thesis description: This thesis analyzes two narrative works by Virginia Woolf: her seventh novel, To the Lighthouse , and her final novel, Between the Acts . My analysis consists of two major compo - nents: I look at Woolf's post-impressionist poetics and examine, by way of a critical approach based on narrative theory, the construction of these poetics. Throughout, my interest is that of showing the trans - formation of classic realist representation of reality in these two nov - els. This transformation, I argue, is very subtly constructed through the narrator's function, and the blending of dialogue and stream of consciousness. Future plans: I plan to take time off from school and work.alyssa Marie MCClusKey English Education Hope, ME Camden Hills Regional High School The Ashley Treatment: A Bioethical Analysis Advisor: Jessica Miller Thesis description: This thesis focuses on the analysis of a set of procedures coined \"The Ashley Treatment.\" Ashley was a 6-year-old girl diagnosed with static encephalopathy and severe developmental disabilities. Her parents opted for a set of procedures, justified by her physicians and the hospital ethics committee, which enabled easier at-home care. The thesis presents a scientific case study and an ex - planation of the treatments, and applies accepted bioethical principles to analyze the treatments and motives. I conclude that \"The Ashley Treatment\" was unethical as Ashley's parents used medicine to solve a social problem and her physicians behaved immorally and should not have been allowed to conduct their treatments. This case points out a glaring disparity in resources for those with disabilities and their families. Hopefully, this recognition will bring advocacy and better care for those with cognitive disabilities. Future plans: I will attend medical school. Christopher MCgary Biology Virginia Beach, V A Ocean Lakes High School Back When We Spoke in Cursive Advisor: Gregory Howard Thesis description: My thesis is a collection of short fiction in - terested primarily in the formation and function of nostalgia. Its nine vignettes make an archaeological investigation of several fantastical settings (a town veined with waterslides, a nocturnal orchestra, a lab - yrinthine subway station, etc.) to examine the roles of kinetic percep - tion, synesthesia and language with regards to memory. Future plans: I plan to spend a year writing and working before proceeding to graduate school. lydia MCosCar English Psychology Bangor, ME Bnagor High School 2012 M inerv a37 Flat Tax Reform for the State of Maine Advisor: Phillip Trostel Thesis description: Flat tax theory has been explored and modeled at the federal level, but it has significant application at the state level as well. This paper investigates the feasibility of replacing Maine's current income and sales taxes with a single, flat rate income tax. Analysis of 2008 U.S. Census data on state and local government finances and Maine state tax policy indicate that a flat tax rate with a generous personal allowance offers a revenue-neutral tax system that meets principles of optimal taxation. It also may increase social wel - fare and promote economic activity in Maine. The effect of this tax reform on tax burden distribution, tax compliance, Maine's economic performance, and various equity-related issues is also explored. Future plans: I will research the economic impacts of early child - hood education investment in Maine with Philip Trostel at the Marga - ret Chase Smith Policy Center, and plan to raise a family and spend a long and happy life with my husband Andrew.MiriaM alison Conners Morgan Economics Spanish Old Town, ME Mt.

Morin New Media Film & Video, Studio Art Brunswick, ME Brunswick High School Optimization of Microwave Assisted Extraction of Resveratrol from Tree Bark Advisor: Barbara Cole, Raymond Fort Thesis description: My thesis studied whether a microwave-based extraction process could be improved for the extraction of resveratrol from tree bark so that it would be more efficient than traditional meth - ods of extraction. Resveratrol is a compound found in grapes, in the bark of some tree species and among other sources that has implica - tions in human health. Using a specially designed microwave reactor, I extracted various bark samples under different temperatures, in dif - ferent solvents, and for different periods of time. Currently tree bark is an unused product of the tree in the pulp and paper industry. If, given further studies, enough resveratrol could be extracted from that bark efficiently, it could become another source of revenue for the industry. Future plans: My post graduation plan is to begin the job search.dustin niedt Chemistry Waterville, ME South Portland High School Analysis Modeling and Optimization of a Smart Sulky Advisor: Michael Peterson Thesis description: My thesis centered around deriving the equa - tions of motion for a Smart Sulky which was being developed as a Mechanical Engineering capstone project. The Smart Sulky is de - signed to reduce the side to side movements of a Standardbred har - ness racing sulky as it moves on the track. Reducing these movements will allow the sulky to track straighter behind the horse and shorten race times. Knowing the equations of motion for the Smart Sulky, as well as the inputs to these equations, allowed the capstone team to refine the development of the Smart Sulky and adjust specific parts needed to ensure its future success. Future plans: I plan to work on my family's dairy farm in Rich - mond, as well as work part time for the horse racing surfaces testing company Biologically Applied Engineering. My goal is to work to - wards becoming a Professional Engineer in the future.niCholas C. noBle Mechanical Engineering Education, Mathematics Richmond, ME Richmond High School Minerv a 201238 The Role of Reactive Oxygen Species in Autophagy Activation During Candida albicans Infection Advisor: Robert Wheeler Thesis description: The immune system protects us against disease by direct destruction of pathogens. Host cells can control infections by activating an enzyme called NADPH oxidase, which generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill pathogens directly. Autopha - gy, a recycling pathway within the cell, can also target pathogens for destruction by activation through ROS in vitro. We are using trans - parent zebrafish to characterize the role of autophagy during a fungal infection. By treating the organism with various chemicals that inhibit different stages of the pathway, we can gain a clearer understanding of the roles of NADPH oxidase, ROS, and autophagy during a live, in vivo, infection. Future plans: Over the summer I am traveling to Europe for 3 weeks to sight-see and explore. In the fall, I will be attending Pacific University College of Optometry, located in Forest Grove, OR.ashley elizaBeth noru M Biology Chemistry, Microbiology Fairbanks, AK West Valley High School Electioneering Across the Ages: Examining the Application and Implication of Media-based Mobilization in Presidential Campaigns Post-Radio Advisor: Mark Brewer Thesis description: This thesis traces the evolution of mobilization (also known as get-out-the-vote) strategies across the entire history of American presidential campaigning. More specifically, the piece analyzes campaign teams' use of assorted media in attempting to get citizens to the polls. The complex campaigning progression from ra - dio to social networking is explored and explained with the help of archived newspaper articles and insider accounts.

CaMeron Curtis o'Brien Political Science Augusta, ME Cony High School The Effects of Suggestion on Dream Recall Frequency Advisor: K. Lira Yoon Thesis description: My research was designed to examine the role of suggestion in dream recall frequency (DRF). Participants were giv - en the suggestion of either a high dream capacity or an average dream capacity (a falsified measure of how often they dream) and asked to record the frequency of their dreams for seven consecutive mornings. Results of my study, while not significant due to lack of participants, indicated that those given the suggestion of a high dream capacity reported a higher DRF than those given the suggestion of an average dream capacity. Future plans: I plan to remain in the Orono area for a few years before pursuing a career in finance elsewhere. I also have the tentative plan of returning to psychology at some point farther down the road.JaCK J. oBery Psychology Topsham, ME Mt. Ararat High School Affecting the Gold Standard: A Monetary Structure for Yesterday and Today Advisor: Michael Montgomery Thesis description: This thesis was an exploration of use of the Gold Standard as a fixed-rate monetary structure, chiefly within the United States. The thesis is broken into three chapters which describe fixed-rate monetary standards and money, key historical applications of the Gold Standard both domestically and abroad, and adoption of the Gold Standard, respectively. Future plans: I plan to find a position within the finance department of a Maine-based company with international ties. I hope to hold this position for several years before attending graduate school. Travel, too, will be in my life as much as possible. sarah hutChins paCheCo Financial Economics Business Administration Winthrop, ME Winthrop High School 2012 M inerv a39 Prolific Playwrights: Clifford Odets and Lillian Hellman Expose the Thirties Advisor: Nathan Godfried Thesis description: Clifford Odets and Lillian Hellman were two of the most influential playwrights of the 1930s, a decade of economic instability and political unrest in the United States. Both playwrights generated controversy with their plays through emphasis of Popular Front values. They were influenced by the political, social, and eco - nomic conditions in the 1930s. An in-depth analysis of their plays re - veals how the interrelationship between playwright and society is best understood through an examination of the role of class and the role of male and female characters. With a look at two plays each by both Odets and Hellman, the works offer insight into the changes in society as well as the development of the cultural history of the 1930s. Future plans: I will work as a stage manager over the summer in VT and Maine, and then take a year to work while I research graduate school programs in both history and theatre.saMantha lynn paradis History, Theater Skowhegan, ME Skowhegan Area High School The Case for Instrumental Music Education: The Academic, Physical, and Social Benefits for Students Advisor: Jack Burt Thesis description: Through instrumental music education, stu - dents simultaneously develop cognitive and physical ability, and so - cial skills. It has been proven that student math and science test scores improve through reading music and participation in an instrumental program. Students learn a new language that is more complex than any other written language and they improve their physical motor skills by studying piano or other instruments. Students learn leader - ship, organization, dedication, and teamwork, and develop an inter - active awareness through ensemble playing. All objective evidence indicates the importance of instrumental music education schools. Future plans: I plan to teach instrumental music to secondary stu - dents in the New England, and to earn a master's degree in instrumen - tal conducting to help me better serve my students. Kayla Marie peard Music Education (Instrumental) York, ME York High School Characterization of Genes in the CFTR-mediated Innate Immune Response Advisor: Carol Kim Thesis description: Cystic fibrosis is among the most common ge - netically inherited diseases in the world, and is a result of a mutation in the CFTR gene. A primary cause for mortality in cystic fibrosis pa - tients is respiratory failure due to the accumulation of pathogens in the lungs, combined with an overzealous immune response. The innate immune system, the body's first response to fighting an infection, is also affected by the CFTR mutation. Identification and characteriza - tion of other genes affected by the CFTR mutation and bacterial infec - tion is a crucial part to understanding the abnormal immune response in cystic fibrosis patients. I demonstrated that Smad3, a transcription factor responsible for the regulation of certain immune-related tar - gets, could help play a defensive role against infection. Future plans: I am returning to UMaine for a master's degree in Microbiology and plan to pursue a PhD, or work in medical research.eriC MiChael peterMan Biochemistry (Molecular & Cellular Biology) Mendon, MA Nipmuc Regional High School At What Cost?: A Study of the American Highway System and the Maine East-West Highway Proposal Advisor: Mimi Killinger, Robert Glover Thesis description: Highway construction has been a staple of American development since the early twentieth century, drastical - ly changing the American landscape. As we continue our quest for increased connectivity and infrastructure, we must do so with a bal - anced look at the costs and benefits associated with highway con - struction, across a wide spectrum of political, sociological, economic, and environmental concerns. Are we considering all options, or are we simply trying to hastily solve twenty-first century problems with twentieth century solutions? Do the potential benefits associated with additional highway construction projects outweigh the costs? My the - sis addresses these questions and raises new ones as we discuss the prospects of an East-West Highway in Maine. Future plans: I will attend the University of Maine Law School after taking a year off to work full-time.Brian andrew philBroo K Political Science Legal Studies, Professional Writing Belfast, ME Belfast Area High School Minerv a 201240 Business Meetings: A Look at how the Physical Environment Effects Overall Efficiency of Meetings Advisor: Stephanie Welcomer Thesis description: Increasing effectiveness of meetings for dis - persed teams is crucial to success in businesses today. Virtual aspect of meetings held by teams of people who are not in the same geo - graphical space can create communication barriers. Little research has been done to compare effectiveness of audio and video confer - encing. Effectiveness of meetings was determined by four mediating constructs: level of multitasking, time management, participation and accomplishment. Ten employees from a Maine semiconductor com - pany who regularly communicate with team members in Singapore participated. A survey of twenty questions was created and completed by employees. Although the sample size was too small to run statis - tical data, observations were made about trends for further research. Based on data collected, it can be assumed that video conferencing is the more effective form of communication for dispersed teams, but requires more preparation and practice than audio conferences.raChel Marie porter Managment Buxton, ME Bonny Eagle High School Occupy Horror: An Analysis of Gothic Motifs and Malefic Technological Prostheses in Contemporary Horror Films Advisor: Steve Evans Thesis description: My thesis explores the genre of Western con - temporary horror films, with a focus on the way technological com - munication devices (the telephone, the internet-connected computer, and the television) are given a life of their own and rendered ma - leficent. By staging the anxieties and ambivalences we as a society feel towards our technological prostheses alongside classic Victorian Gothic motifs, the films I analyze force us to confront age-old ten - sions through a 21st century lens. Future plans: I'm taking some time off to figure out what graduate path I want to pursue, but eventually I'll get my PhD in the literary or social justice realm. alexis priestley English Psychology Jonesport, ME Jonesport-Beals High School Improving Assistive Technology Through Phenomenology: A Comparative Analysis of Research Methods Advisor: Nicholas Giudice Thesis description: Developing successful assistive technology relies on successful communication between the developer and the end user. Through comparative analysis, my thesis examined focus groups and phenomenology as approaches for developing assistive technology. I proposed that the methodology offered by phenomenol - ogy gives a more complete and rich account of potential experience than traditional focus groups, due to its ability to get at the essence of an individual's experience. I concluded that the dialogic nature of interviewing in phenomenology, as well as the rigorous and thorough methods by which the data is analyzed would maximize communica - tion between the designer and user, and reform the way that designers see the process of development. Future plans: I plan to pursue a PhD in clinical psychology and continue to work on new strategies for treating anxiety disorders. raFael MiChael raMos iv Psychology (Abnormal/Social), Philosophy Panama City, FL Data Logging Radiation Detector Advisor: Rick Eason Thesis description: This thesis presents background information on the theory and importance of radiation detection, specifically fo - cusing on the design and test of a radiation detection device called the Data Logging Radiation Detector. This device is a consumer level Geiger counter that is capable of measuring ionizing radiation which can be harmful to human health. A switched mode power supply gen - erates the necessary high voltage to bias a Geiger tube, which then senses three types of ionizing radiation: alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays. Output from the Geiger tube is processed by a mi - crocontroller and written to an SD card. Data can then be read and plotted on a personal computer. Future plans: I plan either to attend graduate school in Electrical Engineering at UMaine or pursue a career in industry.Joseph reCord Electrical Engineering Augusta, ME Cony High School 2012 M inerv a41 Sex-related Differences in Color Contrast Discrimination: A Pilot Study Advisor: Leonard Kass Thesis description: The purpose of this pilot study was to investi - gate differences between males and females in color contrast discrim - ination. I conducted experiments using a newly developed VISION software which examined the differential performance of male and female human subjects in discerning stimuli of various colors against backgrounds of various colors displayed on an LED computer screen. These stimuli consisted of hollow, colored squares, each containing a single aperture on its left or right side. Subjects were required to se - lect on which side they perceived the aperture. Previous studies have indicated that both physiological and behavioral-psychological dif - ferences exist between males and females which affect color percep - tion. This study revealed that females exhibited significantly longer response times and more failures to respond than males in all of the experimental protocols. I have recommended several alterations to the software which will be conducive to better results in future studies by reducing the influence of behavioral-psychological differences. peter guy royal Biology, English (Literary Critical Writing) Ellsworth, ME Ellsworth High School Between \"Student\" and \"Athlete\": The Academic Institution's Role in the Self Identification of Division I Student-Athletes Advisor: Amy Blackstone Thesis description: This study focused on the importance of the academic institution as an external force on the student-athlete expe - rience. A voluntary online survey, powered by Qualtrics, was admin - istered to all 410 student-athletes at the University of Maine. A basic analysis of the survey results revealed that particular conduits of the academic institution may be important in the balance between student and athlete, specifically professor expectations, school sanctioned organizations, and Honors College enrollment. Also, future plans to attend graduate school were highly correlated with student-athlete self identification. The use of this information has the potential to enhance balance between the dual roles of student and athlete so as to best achieve the athletic and academic goals of the Athletic Department. Future plans: I plan to attend graduate school in the fall in the UK at Loughborough University to earn an MSc. in the sociology of sport.helaina saCCo Sociology Political Science Marion, MA Old Rochester Regional High School Development of Oxidizer Flow Control for Use in Hybrid Rocket Motors of the Scientific Sounding Rocket Scale Advisor: Senthil Vel Thesis description: Sounding rockets are a common way of trans - porting instruments higher than 100,000ft, but they are expensive, often inefficient and can damage payloads on takeoff. A hybrid rocket engine would be an excellent propulsion option because a throttled motor would allow the vehicle to leave the pad more gently and in - crease the efficiency by achieving greater altitude and using less fuel. Developing the oxidizer flow control system is necessary for a throt - tled hybrid propulsion system. If the oxidizer control method inves - tigated in this thesis was implemented on a real motor, it would be possible for researchers to determine an optimized thrust profile that could be loaded into computers before flight. Future plans: I will take a year off to sea kayak,explore the con - nection between art and WWOOF in Europe before moving west to pursue a career working in aerospace propulsion systems. luKe Clovis saindon Mechanical Engineering Mathematics Deer Isle, ME Deer Isle Stonington High School Resistance of Abomasal Parasites to Common Anthelmintics in Small Ruminants in the Northeast Advisor: James Weber Thesis description: worm of ruminants, Haemon - chus contortus , is detrimental to Northeast sheep and goats. It is also often resistant to anthelmintics commonly used by sheep producers in Maine. We developed methods to assess the response of these par - asites to anthelmintics. Fecal samples from experimentally infected sheep in West Virginia and from two farms in Maine were used as sources of parasite ova and larvae in these experiments. Parasites were grown to the L3 stage, examined, and then studied using mo - tility tests, Methylthiazol Tetrazolium assays and spectrophotometry. Due to selection for resistance over time in Maine parasites, we ex - pect anthelmintics to have a higher kill rate on parasites obtained from West Virginia than on parasites collected from Maine.

But, as not-for-profit orga - nizations, they rely heavily on donations and voluntary support from the public. In order to achieve their mission, the ASPCA (American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) and PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), two of the most popular animal welfare organizations, rely heavily on mass communication fundrais - ing campaigns. My research study examines four mass communica - tion campaigns from the ASPCA and PETA. The campaigns involve the use of mass communication through print, television/video broad - casting, mail, and the Internet. I describe how each organization uses these forms of mass communication to successfully accomplish their fundraising goals. Future plans: I plan to earn my law degree and become an animal welfare attorney.JaiMe e. r. shorter Mass Communication Psychology Hastings-on-Hudson, NY Hastings High School Health Impacts at the Advent of Agriculture Advisor: Kristin Sobolik Thesis description: The transition from hunting and gathering to an agricultural way of life may have been the key development made by past peoples, transforming diet, social structure, mobility, and re - source use. I present human skeletal evidence illustrating the conse - quences of agriculture on human health using case studies from pre - historic Mesoamerica, the American southwest, and regions in Asia. Such evidence has indicated that intensification of maize agriculture in the New World correlates with increased infant mortality rate, den - tal caries, iron-deficiency anemia, and an overall decline in general health, while these health problems have little to no correlation to ear - ly intensification of rice agriculture in Asia. This is likely due to the decreased cariogenic nature of rice and its greater nutritional value, processing differences, or greater dietary variety in Asia. Future plans: I would like to find a job in archaeological field work, or work with AmeriCorps before attending graduate school.erin leigh snape Anthropology Earth Sciences Enfield, ME Penobscot Valley High School An Introduction to Nine Original Plays: A Creative Thesis Advisor: Sandra Hardy Thesis description: I wrote, edited, produced and analyzed nine ab - surdist plays.

Clint snyder Theater, Mass Communication Crete, IL Crete-Monee High School Modeling the Spread of Biologically-Inspired Internet Worms Advisor: Sudarshan Chawathe, David Hiebeler Thesis description: Infections by malicious software, such as In - ternet worms, spreading on computer networks can have devastating consequences, resulting in loss of information, time, and money. To better understand how these worms spread, and thus how to more effectively limit future infections, we apply epidemiological models to simulate the proliferation of certain types of Internet worms that use biologically-inspired strategies. From complete scans of the Inter - net, we find that vulnerable machines do seem to be highly clustered on the Internet. In addition, our simulations of worms spreading on the Internet suggest that this emergent organization likely fosters the quick and comprehensive proliferation of these types of worms.

Given this, it is vital that we are constantly examining and cri - tiquing the juvenile justice system to ensure positive outcomes such as low recidivism. My thesis takes an in-depth look at the ways in which the United States responds to this unique class of offenders and which treatment options are most effective. Several factors play a role in the selection of a program for individuals in the juvenile justice system, including definitions of violence, assessment, and availability of the treatment desired.

Researchers have tried to better under - stand factors to predict symptoms consistent with GAD diagnosis. Tull and colleagues (2009) found that some cognitive factors may serve as predisposing factors to GAD. My thesis continues this research by assessing the predictive nature of cognitive constructs (worry, rumi - nation, coping styles, and anxiety sensitivity) with GAD symptoms. Undergraduate students (N =285) completed anxiety-related mea - sures in an online anxiety prediction study. Results show that women reported more symptoms than men. In addition, regression analyses indicated gender differences in predictors of GAD. Coping strategies and rumination proved to add to the prediction of GAD.

Cofilin 1 like is a protein that can bind to actin and affect its organization. I studied the development of zebrafish with normal and significantly decreased levels of cofilin 1 like protein. A morpholino can be injected at the one to two cell stage of the embryo. It partially binds to the mRNA coding for cofilin 1 like protein inhib - iting the protein's synthesis by ribosomal translation. The idea is that cofilin 1 like is required for normal development of pectoral fins. I documented delay in the fin development of fish with close to 80% less cofilin 1 like protein. The overall abnormal phenotype and its im - plications are being explored, but results could apply to cell migration issues and its role in the metastasis and development of cancers. Future plans: I plan to join the Peace Corps, and pursue art and language before attending graduate school in a medical field.ariel sterling twoMey Biology Hamilton, MA Hamilton-Wenham Regional High School Minerv a 201244 A Growing Town: Developing a Local Food System in Orono, Maine Advisor: Kathleen P.

A growing number of people think that maybe local food systems are the solution. But what exactly is a local food system and what elements make one successful but another fail? The goal of my thesis was to identify the factors that are essential to a local food sys - tem and then apply these aspects to develop models of an expanded local food system in Orono. Through research and the utilization of computer geographic information systems, we can better understand our communities and how they can be supplied with food in a more sustainable, healthful, and interactive way.

The aim of my thesis is to give insight both on a specific mind-body-spiritual practice and on how Reiki and similar modali - ties might be accepted as treatments and integrated into biomedicine. Research was completed through standard anthropological methods: interviews, participant observation, and field notes. Twenty-seven Reiki practitioners were interviewed to learn about their perspectives on Reiki and the progression towards integration.

Phelps Advisor: Solomon Goldman Thesis description: This thesis was an in-depth exploration of Sny- der v. Phelps , a case recently decided by the Supreme Court. I argued that the decision was not a narrow one and that it posed great risk for both the target of hurtful speech and the speaker. While the court claimed to have narrowly tailored their decision to the facts of the case, the ambiguity present within their decision created something much more ominous. This case allows speakers to say what they will about individuals as long as their speech is part of a larger conversa - tion on a matter of public concern. Under Snyder v. Phelps , any indi - vidual could become the target of intentional infliction of emotional distress with no legal recourse. Future plans: I am heading to the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law in Arizona to pursue my competing interests in criminal and constitutional law. Meghan dorothy white Political Science Legal Studies, Philosophy Upton, MA Nipmuc Regional High School A Case Study of How Innovation Can Impact Local Economic Development in a Town/Gown Environment Advisor: Jake Ward Thesis description: My thesis focussed on finding a better way for towns to \"do\" economic development. Currently, there's no reproduc - ible system for economic development that towns can adopt and man - age on their own. My thesis focussed on finding one, by using Orono, ME as a case study and 'test bed' for implementing Innovation En - gineering \u2014 a systematic approach to innovation \u2014 in a municipal governance model. Orono was able to expedite work on a number of projects, including bringing the highest speed internet available in the world to businesses and residents, by using Innovation Engineering. Future plans: I enjoy long walks on the beach. No, really.nathaniel s.

The sociological concept of framing refers to how social movement organizations understand and present a concept or event they view as a problem. Using content anal - ysis on the respective websites and pamphlets, my findings show that all three organizations have a common master frame of animal cruel - ty and sub-frames of suffering and sentience, necessity, exploitation, and harm to humans. The difference in the content of the sub-frames indicates differential views of PETA, HSUS, and ASPCA regarding animal cruelty. My findings provide a foundation of the differential definitions of animal cruelty by animal advocacy organizations. Future plans: I plan to attend Tuft's University graduate school for Animal and Public Policy and have a career in animal advocacy.Cary williaMs Sociology Greenwich, CT Greenwich High School An Adaptive Reuse & Restoration of a Maine Barn Advisor: Edwin Nagy Thesis description: This is a study of the post and beam barn in Orono, ME that examines the changes necessary to use the barn as an event center. Included is a structural analysis of the current barn struc - ture to determine its adequacy for the new use under current design standards, such as IBC 2009. The architectural portion of this study examines the capacity of the building and the egress and restroom facilities requirements for that capacity, as well as the ADA require - ments. Provided is a final design that incorporates the architectural as - pects and the structural changes necessary to meet modern standards. Future plans: I plan to pursue an advanced master's degree in Structural Analysis of Monuments and Historical Constructions. This program is a cooperative effort between Universities in Spain, Italy, Portugal, and the Czech Republic.sarah elizaBeth williaMs Civil Engineering Richmond, ME Richmond High School War of the Words Advisor: Mark Brewer, Richard Powell Thesis description: My thesis looks at the way the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine, an FCC regulation on opinionated and biased ra - dio broadcasting, affected the rise of political talk radio. It went on to examine the possible effects the repeal of the Doctrine have had on political polarization in the United States. I found that following the removal of the Fairness Doctrine, talk radio, and specifically Con - servative political talk radio, rapidly increased in both the number of stations and number of listeners and that listening to conservative talk radio, and openly biased news sources in general, can be correlated with more polarized partisan attitudes. Future plans: I plan to teach English abroad in China for a year before returning to the US to attend law school.JaCKson roBert witherill Political Science International Affairs Readfield, ME Maranacook Community High School Oedipus & Electra Revisited: A Study of Human Mate Selection Advisor: Cynthia Erdley Thesis description: I conducted a psychological study of human mate selection in a sample of college students using theories of tem - plate matching (individuals select mates based on a template of their opposite-sex parent), assortative mating (we choose partners similar to ourselves) and other relevant trends. I predicted that more evidence would be obtained to support template matching and that the overall affect of mothers on the male participants would be greater than the effect of fathers on the female participants. Participants were in a het - erosexual relationship for at least three consecutive months and had both a same-sex and opposite-sex parent figure present in their lives. Participants completed online assessments of physical appearance, personality and sex/gender roles for themselves, their parents and their partner. Overall, the results of my study support its hypotheses. Future plans: I will earn my master's in Clinical Psychology - Prac - titioners Track at Loyola University in Baltimore, MD. Kaitlin May wortel Boer Psychology Spanish Portland, ME Deering High School Minerv a 201246 Growth and Structure of Thin Film Silver Oxide Materials Advisor: Robert J. Lad Thesis description: I deposited silver and oxidized it in a vacuum chamber to create silver oxide thin films. These films were character - ized by our research group, and I specifically characterized them via x-ray diffraction. We determined the structure of the films, the compo - sition and many other properties. Using this information we adjusted the deposition parameters to produce silver oxide closer to the desired composition. I also performed experiments in the vacuum chamber to determine the oxidation rate of the silver in order to further adjust the deposition parameters. Future plans: I hope to find employment in the semiconductor industry, assisting in research or the optimization of manufacturing semiconductors. Long term I plan on continuing my education by earning a master's degree and PhD to advance in the industry. Matthew w. wright Physics Mathematics Newport Center, VT North Country Union High School The Honors Celebration was, once again, the highlight of commencement weekend at UMa - ine. More than 600 students, faculty, parents, fam - ily and friends gathered to recognize the Honors College Class of 2012. President Ferguson and Pro - vost Hunter joined us and offered congratulatory remarks and reflections on the remarkable year the Honors College community has had. As always, Dean Charlie Slavin personally read the name and thesis title of every graduate before they received their medallion and stein. Honors Celebration 2012 2012 M inerv a47 Please tell us a little bit about yourself and what you studied at UMaine. I'm a non-traditional student and proud single mom. My 13 year old son, Jacob, is the center of my universe. I have always prized education, but I took an unorthodox approach to my de - gree. At the age of 18 I left home for college, but it wasn't the right time for me to pursue my collegiate dreams. I moved to the Boston area and enjoyed a gig singing and dancing on a cruise ship that circled the harbor. Then I moved to New York City in pursuit of grander perfor - mance venues. Although my lifestyle was anything but traditional, I wouldn't have changed a moment of it. When my son was born in 1999, the artistic lifestyle I had grown accustomed to was no longer a viable career option. I obtained my Real Estate license and earned my Brokers license. I continued this line of work for nearly a decade. When my mother suggested moving back to Maine to pursue my academic dreams, I took her advice. It was terrifying to leave our life in NYC behind. At the age of 32 I took a deep breath and started down a life-changing new path. As a student at UMaine, I had the opportunity to take my passion for civic contributions to a whole new level. This was my chance to develop skills - maybe even a career - focused on social equity for underrepresented members of our global society. This desire has since led me to India, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia where I have sought practical methods for incorporating social equity at the grassroots level. It's been an incredible journey so far! What was your thesis topic and how did you come to choose it? My Honors Thesis, entitled Meaningful Contributions to Poverty Alleviation through Microfi - nance , was designed as a comparative cross-case study analysis of two leading Microfinance Institutions: Grameen Bank and BRAC. It focused upon microfinance best practices intent on expanding microfinance outreach to targeted borrower groups, especially those in abject poverty. I believe strongly in the power of microfinance. It's an excellent model for reducing social inequities and for creating economic growth opportunities at the grassroots level. Can you tell us about your Fulbright Fellowship and how it impacted your UMaine experience? I'd assert that my UMaine education strongly impacted the Fulbright experience! At UMaine I gathered and sharpened the business and economic tools necessary for real-world success. UMaine offers its students wonderful mentors and an incredible support network, especially in the professors and administrators of the Business School and Honors College. Charlie Slavin was always championing my requests for international internships and research projects. I first learned about microfinance at UMaine \u2014a chapter in my BUA 201 textbook ended with a little vignette about Grameen Bank. The name sounded familiar, so I Googled it, and by semester's end, I had secured an internship and was off to Bangladesh! That's how my journey began. I've returned to Bangladesh four times for microfinance research and to advance the efforts of my NPO, Seeds of Change Consulting. My current Fulbright Fellowship is really just part of a larger ongoing effort. All roads lead to my end goal: contributions to closing gender and income dis - parities, and economic development. It's been an incredible, exciting adventure so far and I can't imagine doing anything else. Why was Honors important to you? Honors is such a special part of the UMaine experience. As a member of the HC, I was able to gain new perspectives and explore worthwhile academic pursuits. Honors really allows us to move beyond our comfort zone and embrace a more holistic approach to academia. a vi s i t wi t h raCh e l bi nDe r-ha t h a w a y What advice can you give to future Honors students? I can't overstate how special the Honors College is. I would strongly encourage students invited into the program to stay the course. Be - ing an Honors student is a unique opportunity. Like anything, you get out of the program what you put into it. So, those students looking for academic challenges and new perspectives should keep on keepin' on. I'm certainly glad that I did. My only other advice is this: pursue your passions. It seems an obvi - ous statement, but in reality it's easy to let those flames fade into em - bers. Make the conscious choice to take a chance, to try something off-the-wall. Whatever moves you, just be fearless and go for it! RObE R T b.
