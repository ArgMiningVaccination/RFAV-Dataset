To Request an Action Plan to Address ALL Your Health Concerns [Click Here](requestactionplan.asp) How many of you reading this article are tired of the lack of true solutions to your health concerns? You go to your Medical Doctor, either because your insurance will pay for it OR you believe in the traditional allopathic form of care of having tests done to focus in on your problem, OR you just don't know what else to do? You want to understand \"Why\" you feel the way you do and simply want that feeling to go away. You want to feel better. You want to be healthy. And yet, that never seems to be true for you. So you go to your Medical Doctor or perhaps your Nurse Practitioner and get the results of your tests and are then given a prescription medication or two for your pain or symptom and then you go home feeling less than satisfied. You are left looking at the bottle or two of prescription medication for a condition you do not understand, nor do you feel your Medical Doctor does either. So you go to Google, type in the name of your medication to look for side-effects and find the list of side-effects to be worse than the symptoms you went into see your doctor for initially. Then you look up the name of the condition your Medical Doctor told you they are treating you for and you are not totally convinced this is what you have. This leads to feeling unhappy, unsatisfied and unsure of what to do. You do not want your condition and you do not want the side-effects of your prescription medication. You just want to feel better, feel normal, feel happy. So Now What?

Unfortunately, they can offer symptom masking medications known to have harmful side-effects or surgery. They really do not offer more than that. They are the BEST Diagnosticians and their testing methods are top notch. Unfortunately, following their recommendations WITHOUT answering the most important question, \"WHY?\" will only create problems for you. Treatments oriented to masking symptoms or addressing the result of the problem, without dealing with the CAUSE is a recipe for disaster. BEFORE proceeding with any treatment, regardless of it coming from a medical practitioner or any other heath ally, make sure you get a full understanding of \"WHY?\" Only when you understand the mechanism of cause will you be able to fully commit to the care being offered. Any lack of information or misunderstanding you may have can and will create uncertainty in the results. By getting a solid \"WHY?\" you increase the results you will receive, as you will increase the confidence you have in your provider and the plan of action to get you back to wellness.
