Product introduction Covishield Vaccine has been developed by AstraZeneca with Oxford university in the UK and is being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII) in Pune. Successful clinical trials have been conducted in S.Africa, Brazil, and the UK with bridging study results in the Indian population based on which the approval was granted by DCGI (Drugs Controller General of India) Covishield Vaccine is given as an injection into the muscle of the upper arm. The vaccination course consists of two separate doses. The government of India has extended the gap between the first and the second dose to 12-16 weeks. Taking just a single dose is not enough as it is insufficient to produce a protective level of antibodies in the body to prevent the infection. So make sure you turn up for the second dose. Initially, the recommended doses were given 4 to 6 weeks apart. However, clinical trials showed that Covishield Vaccine has an average efficacy of 54% when the 2 doses are administered 4 to 6 weeks apart. Furthermore, the efficacy has been reported to increase to around 79% if the gap between 2 doses is increased. Therefore, according to the new directives, the gap between the 2 doses has been raised to 12-16 weeks. The possible side effects of Covishield Vaccine include reactions at the site of injection (such as pain, swelling, and redness), headache, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, joint pain, fatigue, malaise (general discomfort), fever, chills, and flu-like symptoms. Most of these side effects are mild and temporary (subside within 2-3 days) that subside on their own. If required, you may take paracetamol to provide symptomatic relief. However, if these persist (symptoms continue beyond 2-3 days) or get worse, let the doctor know. To make sure the vaccine is safe, before receiving the vaccine, it is important to let your doctor or vaccinator know if you have any other illnesses, history of any allergy, fever, or bleeding disorders. You should also tell the doctor about all the medicines you are taking, especially blood thinners or any medicines affecting your immune system. Children, pregnant women, and breastfeeding mothers have not been a part of the vaccine trials. Therefore, they should not get the vaccine at this time as the safety of the medicine for them is still not known. Also, individuals who have received another COVID-19 vaccine should not receive Covishield Vaccine.

How Covishield Solution for Injection works Covishield Vaccine contains a non-replicating virus (a weakened chimpanzee adenovirus that causes common cold), that is genetically engineered to produce coronavirus proteins in the body, but the virus is weakened and cannot cause the disease. It provides active immunization against Covid-19 infection that helps you fight the virus if exposed. This means there is a reduced risk of developing the illness and its consequences. Quick tips Covishield Vaccine is a 2-dose vaccination regimen. The second dose is administered between 12 to 16 weeks after the first dose. Covishield Vaccine is usually given into the muscle (intramuscularly) of the upper arm. Getting vaccinated is voluntary. However, it is advisable to complete the vaccination schedule to restrict the spread of the virus. Have a proper meal before visiting the vaccination site. Do not get vaccinated on an empty stomach. Individuals with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection should defer vaccination for 14 days after symptoms resolution as they may increase the risk of spreading the infection to others at the vaccination site. A minimum interval of 14 days should be maintained between the administration of any other vaccine. However, if the benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential unknown risks of vaccine coadministration, COVID-19 and other vaccines may be administered within a shorter period (e.g., tetanus vaccine, rabies vaccine, etc.) You may be observed at the vaccination center itself to guard against any immediate allergic reaction or side effect. In addition to vaccination, observe other control measures such as social distancing, mask donning, and hand-washing. Covishield Vaccine is currently not meant to be administered in children as safety and efficacy are not yet established. "}
