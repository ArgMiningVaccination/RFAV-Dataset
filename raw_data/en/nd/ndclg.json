Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023 My doctor suggested I add magnesium to my prenatal vitamin regiment because of knee pain at night. The calcium is a bonus. It tastes pretty good, it is a little grainy if the water isn't hot enough when you mix it. I'm on the subscription (it is a smaller amount but is worth the money) I plan to drink it the remainder of my pregnancy. It helps with the pain but it doesn't take it away completely. It seems to work better when I drink it consistently. Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2023 Love this for my pregnancy and easy to digest! Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2023 I'm not sure how well it worked, I think it made sleep easier and better... but it sure was tasty. I'm disappointed it's gone. Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2023 Good tasting relaxing evening drink since it's made with warm water. Has been real lying helping me get some more sleep. It doesn't completely dissolve so a little bit of a grainy finish. Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2022 The flavor is nice and the effects are calming. However it is chalky and the powder does not completely dissolve even when stirred repeatedly. The leftover powder texture was not great for pregnancy nauseau. Not sure I'd repurchase due to these issues. It was almost there! Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2022 The flavors not there at all pretty much. Hard to take down if your prego n nauseated at all. Works but idk if I can stomach it. Also thought it was strange it didn't come with a scoop. Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2023 I find the mix to be kind of bland, no matter how much or little I use. It's not bad, but I'm also not sure it's actually helping or not. Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2022 The powdered doesn't absorb into the water so you have to keep shaking/stirring it before every drink. It's also pretty flavorless and chalky.
