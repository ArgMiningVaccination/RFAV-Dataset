This article has information to help you during those early weeks. It covers health checks for your baby, support and services, and government paperwork you need to do. DISCLAIMER: Please note the Department of Human Services is now called Services Australia. Go to [servicesaustralia.gov.au](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/) to learn more. Bringing your newborn home Bringing your baby home is exciting, but it can also be daunting to leave the support of the [hospital](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/having-a-baby-in-hospital) or [birthing centre](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/having-a-baby-at-a-birthing-centre) behind. You may also find that [breastfeeding](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/breastfeeding-your-baby) is difficult or you may feel isolated, especially if you don't have friends and family nearby. Whatever your concern, there are services to help in those early days and weeks at home. In the first few days, a [midwife](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/the-role-of-your-midwife) might visit you every day at home. There are also telephone services that you can call night and day, such as parent helplines in your state or territory and the [Australian Breastfeeding Association](https://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/breastfeeding-helpline). Your [local child health clinic](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/child-health-centres) is also a great source of information about feeding and health. Clinics provide support and run groups for new parents, sometimes in languages other than English. Many females feel teary, overwhelmed and/or anxious 3 to 5 days after the birth. This is called the [baby blues](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/baby-blues) and is due to rapidly changing hormone levels after the birth. If these feelings last longer than a few days and they get more intense, talk to your [doctor](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/the-role-of-your-gp) or [child health nurse](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/the-role-of-a-child-health-nurse). These feelings might be a sign that you have [postnatal depression](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/postnatal-depression). What paperwork will I have to do? A new baby means lots of paperwork and filling in forms. You will need to [register your baby's birth and name](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/baby-names), [add your baby to Medicare](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/adding-your-newborn-to-medicare), and arrange [government payments](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/payments-for-families) if you are eligible. The hospital or midwife will give you a [Parent Pack](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/subjects/having-baby/when-your-baby-arrives), which includes most of the forms you need to fill in. An important form in this pack is the Newborn Child Declaration. You will need this form to register your child with Medicare and to complete your application for [Parental Leave Pay](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/paid-parental-leave) or other government payments. A form to register your baby for [My Health Record](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/my-health-record) is also included in the Parent Pack. My Health Record is a digital health record that allows you to share your health information with health service providers if you want to. Health services and support are available to families who have [migrated to Australia](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/support-for-migrants-to-australia) or arrived in Australia as refugees. If you need help with Medicare services in your language, call the [Translating and Interpreting Service](https://www.tisnational.gov.au/) (TIS) on 131 450. What is an infant health record? You will be given a book called an [infant health record](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/infant-health-record) just after your baby is born. This book records important information about your baby, including [their growth](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/how-your-baby-gains-weight), [vaccinations](/immunisation-and-vaccinations-for-your-child) and any health issues. The book might be blue, purple, red, green or yellow, depending on which state or territory you live in. What health checks will my baby need? Your baby will need [regular health checks](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/health-checks-for-babies) in the first few months. The child health nurse at your local child health centre or your [doctor (GP)](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/the-role-of-a-gp) can do these check-ups for your baby, usually at 2, 4 and 6 weeks after birth. The nurse will ask you how your child is doing and if you have any concerns. In most states and territories, your baby's first child health appointment will be at your home. Your hospital or birth centre will organise this visit. You can also ask the nurses at the child health centre or your doctor about anything else that may be worrying you. It's a good idea to write down your questions before the check-ups so you don't forget to ask anything. Child health nurse services are free for families with children up to the age at which they start school. Your baby will need a full health check with a GP or [paediatrician](/what-do-paediatricians-do) when they are 6 weeks old. They may also have their first immunisations at this check. Resources and support There are many sources of information and support, often available 7 days a week, including the following: - You can talk to your GP or early childhood health nurse. - Pregnancy, Birth and Baby provides information and support. You can [talk with a maternal child health nurse](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/about-pregnancy-birth-and-baby)by phone on 1800 882 436 or via [video call](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/video-call).
