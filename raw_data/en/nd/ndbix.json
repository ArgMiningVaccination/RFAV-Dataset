Pfizer's Paxlovid and Merck's Lagevrio pills were given emergency use authorizations in Dec. 2021 for patients with mild-to-moderate COVID who tested positive for the virus, and who were at risk of progressing to severe COVID. Still, the FDA said the patients should have a current diagnosis of mild-to-moderate COVID infection.

The upheaval, which begins in April, will put millions of low-income Americans at risk of losing health coverage, threatening their access to care and potentially exposing them to large medical bills. It will also put pressure on the finances of hospitals, doctors, and others relying on payments from Medicaid, a state-federal program that covers lower-income people and people with disabilities.

Hundreds of people crowded the halls of the state Capitol for a committee hearing on a so-called heartbeat bill.

But a majority of gun deaths, 54 percent, in the U.S. aren't homicides, they're suicides. Indeed, as the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence puts it, suicide is \"the untold story of gun violence in America.\" Both suicides and gun deaths have increased over the last two decades, and there is a strong link between firearms and suicide deaths. Suicide-by-gun makes up most of both gun deaths and overall suicide deaths (over half of each).

The tactics from the FBI, echoed to law enforcement agencies across the country, have been used for decades to teach civilians their options if confronted by an active shooter: evacuate the area, find a place to hide, or - as a last resort - take action against the shooter. More and more, though, engaging the gunman may prove more effective than the other choices, CNN National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem said, with at least one US community shifting away from the \"hide\" piece in lieu of more active defensive steps.

If the proposal stands, it would be a net cut of more than $3 billion to the industry. The major reason behind the proposed pay cut: Medicare officials want to update data and coding systems that are used to explain the health conditions of an insurance company's enrollees. Under that new system, insurers would not get paid as much for members with certain diagnoses.

[ The Washington Post: New Concussion Protocol For Kids: Get Them Back To School Sooner ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/parenting/2023/02/01/concussion-kids-school-treatment/) For years, the treatment protocol for children with concussions involved keeping them out of school to rest in a quiet, dark room with reduced access to screens until they felt better. In the past decade, however, doctors have been moving toward encouraging kids to return to school and light activity after only a couple of days of rest, even if symptoms persist. A recently released study involving more than 1,500 children backs the new approach. It found that an early return to school \u2014 which researchers defined as missing less than three days \u2014 benefited children ages 8 to 18, who had less severe symptoms two weeks after their concussion compared with kids who stayed home longer.
