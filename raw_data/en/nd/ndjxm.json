Anatomy & Physiology4Your Lungs & How They Work The lungs are an important organ that helps you breathe in good air and push out the bad. The lungs pr ovide oxygen to the blood and remove carbon dioxide. The lungs are highlyelastic and lie within the chest cavity. The air you breathe contains oxygen, which helps provide energy for the cells in your body. The lungs are separated bythe wind pipe (trachea). From the windpipe the lungs branchoffinto two par ts, the right and left lung. The left side is slightly smaller having only two segments, the upper andlower lobes. The right lung is divided into thr ee segments, the upper, middle and lower lobes. As air enters your body through your nose or mouth it is warmed and moistened. The air then travels down a system of air tubes known as the tracheobronchial tree (resemblesupside down tree). The bronchial tree begins with yourwindpipe (trachea) and moves down thr ough two big air tubes called the left and right bronchi. These bronchi branchinto your right and left lung and from there air travels intosmaller and smaller air tubes called bronchioles. Attached tothe end of these smaller air tubes are small air sacs calledalveoli.INFORMATION ON LUNG ANATOMY & PHYSIOLOGYAnatomy & Physiology YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE5LUNG DESIGN AND PURPOSE AT A GLANCE The lungs exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide between the airwe breathe and the blood. The tracheobronchial tree is the passage way fr om the mouth to the interiorof the lung. Gas exchange occurs in the alveoli deep in thelungs. Breathing air in (inhalation) requiresmuscular effort. Air is warmed, humidified, and cleaned bythe nose and lungs.There are millions of tiny air sacs (alveoli) in your lungs and they look like a cluster of grapes. These air sacs are very elasticand inflate when you breathe in and deflate when you exhale.The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place in thealveoli. The blood picks up oxygen and takes it to the left side ofyour heart and at the same time the right side of your heartsends blood to release carbon dioxide into the alveoli to beexhaled. The lower part of your lungs rest above a muscle called the diaphragm, your main breathing muscle. When you breathe in,the diaphragm contracts and air can enter your lungs. When youbreathe out, the diaphragm will rise to help push air out of your lungs. If you have lung disease, the diaphragm may not work as well as it should. Instr uction on br eathing techniques can improve air movement into and out of the lungs. bronch ioles alve oli (air sa cs)INFORMATION ON LUNG CONDITIONS & DIAGNOSIS YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE Lung Conditions & Diagnosis6IMEDICAL HISTORY Your doctor will ask you questions that focus on how often you cough, what you cough up, if you are short of breath and if you wheezewhile resting or with activities. Your doctor will look at your pastsmoking and work history. Your doctor will want to know if you havehad contact to dust and/or other lung irritants. Acomplete family histor ywill be done. Y our doctor may ask about family members with pulmonary disease and how old they were whensymptoms appear ed. IPHYSICAL EXAMINATION Your doctor will do a complete examination of your chest. During this examination he/she will observe how fast you breathe, how deep you br eathe and how har dyou work to br eathe. (He will listen to your chest to assess airflow in and out of your lungs and to your heart sounds.) ICHEST X-RAY Achest X-ray is a picture that looks at the size of you lungs and heart. You will need to remove clothing and wear a hospital gown. Staff may request r emoval of jewelr yfrom the upper body. ICHEST CT SCAN (COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY) This scan may be r ecommended to look inside the chest. The test may be done with contrast media (dye) or without. If dye is used, it is given in a small vein of the hand or arm. During the test you will be ask to lie very still on a narrow table that slides into the center of a scanner .The complete scan only takes a few minutes. If dye is used, the scan will last longer. Lung Conditions & Diagnosis YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE7IELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG OR EKG) This test records electrical signals that travel through the heart. The ECG helps your doctordetect some heart abnormalities. You can eat anddrink 10 minutes before this test. During the testyou will be asked to rest quietly while severalpatches will be attached to your chest, arms andlegs with wires that lead to the ECG machine. Thistest can be done in a variety of settings; in the home, in an ambulance, in the emergencydepartment or your hospital room. IPULMONARY FUNCTION TEST (PFT'S) This is a test that measures your breathing by blowing into a tube while sitting in a chair. It willmeasure how much air your lungs can hold andhow quickly you can move air in and out of yourlungs. It will also measure how well your lungs canmove oxygen into the blood. You will want to wear loose clothing that will not get in the way of your ability to breathe deeply.Avoid large meals before your test; this will make itmore comfortable for you to breathe deeply. Check with your doctor befor ethe test if you ar eusing medications that may affect your test results. ITREADMILL OR CYCLE EXERCISE TEST This test helps your doctor assess your br eathing and your hear t. The r esults can help in the planning ofan exercise program that is safe for you. Check with your doctor before the test if you usemedications that may af fect your test r esults. The treadmill is like a moving sidewalk with a handle. As the test progresses, the speed and angle of thebelt will be incr eased. A doctor and a trained technician will observe your pulse, blood pressure,oxygen levels and your ECG during the 5-15 minutetest. IPULSE OXIMETRY This test will estimate the percent of oxygen in your blood (SpO2). Normal values range from 90 to100%. A probe is clipped on the finger or earlobe for measurement. IARTERIAL BLOOD GASES (ABG'S) This test will help your doctor determine if your lungs are getting enough good air in (oxygen) andbad air (carbon dioxide) out. A sample of blood is drawn from an artery, most often near the wrist. IBRONCHOSCOPY This test will help your doctor look at the inside of your airways. A small tube (bronchoscope) is put though your nose or mouth into the air passage of your lungs. The bronchoscope is very thin, bendseasily and has a small light in the tip. Your doctor will give you specific instructions on how to prepare for this test. ICT GUIDED LUNG NEEDLE BIOPSY This is an x-ray guided test. Small samples of lung tissue are taken through a needle. Your doctor will give you specific instructions on how to preparefor this test.

COPD stands for Chr onic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Chronic means long term.Obstructive refers to a blockage or obstruction in the airways of the lungs. Pulmonary refers to the lungs. Disease is referring to sickness. The most common obstructive lung diseases are Chronic Bronchitis, Emphysema, Asthma, Bronchiectasis, and Cystic Fibrosis. If you arediagnosed with COPD you may have one or acombination of any of theses disor ders. What ar ethe Symptoms of COPD? With COPD you may have one or more of these symptoms: Shortness of br eath. A chronic cough or heavy sputum (phlegm or mucus). Wheezing (a high pitched whistling sound caused by air trying to move in and out of your airways). Too much mucus in your lungs. Colds that last for w eeks instead of days. Feeling out of breath doing daily activities (such as bathing, eating, or walking to y our car). Living with a chronic lung disease means learning to control it, and the best way to do that is to be an active par ticipant in your treatment. You will be in control and feel better about yourself and your commitment.IS THERE A CURE FOR COPD? There is no cure for COPD. The damage to the airways and lungs cannot be r eversed. Once COPD is diagnosed, there are many interventions and life style changes that can and should be made to helpimprovethe symptoms and slow the damage to the lungs. The single most important step to take once COPD is diagnosed is to STOPSMOKING. S topping smoking allows your lungs to recover from years of smoke and air pollution. In most cases, lung function impr oves. Symptoms of cough, whee zes, breathlessness, and mucus production may not entirely disappear, but most get better.Even if you do not perceive improvement, the cause of continued damage to y our lungs has been eliminated.Lung Conditions YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE9IASTHMA What is Asthma? Asthma is a chronic reversible lung disease in which the airways become inflamed or swollen. The airwaysbecome narrow and breathing becomes difficult. The airways are extra sensitive to certain triggers or irritants. If asthma is not treated or controlled, it can be a serious life-threatening condition. What are the Symptoms of Asthma? You may have all, some, or just one symptom. Symptoms can be mild or severe: Coughing - This may be the first sign that your asthma is not under control. People with asthma often cough at night, with exercise, in smoky areas, in cold air, after laughing orcrying. Wheezing (a whistling noise when you breathe). Chest tightness (the feeling that someone is squeezing or sitting on your chest). Shortness of br eath. Drop in peak flo wreading. Headache. Itchy,watery ,or glassy ey es. Itchy, scratchy, or sore throat. Stroking chin or thr oat. Sneezing. Restless. Runny nose. Change in face color. Darkcircles under ey es. Breathing faster than normal. Make note of what your most common war ning signs of an asthma episode are. What ar ethe Asthma tr iggers? Atrigger is any object, act, or event that causes the airways to become inflamed or causes asthmasymptoms. These triggers are different for different people. When you know what your trigger is, you will want to avoid that thing. These triggers can include: Dust mites. Animal dander, especially cats. Exercise. Viral infection (cold, bronchitis, pneumonia, flu). Cigarette smoke, smoke from a wood stove. Perfume. Pollens and molds. Cold air. Cockroaches. Grass.Howdo I av oid Triggers? Do not allow smoking in your house or car. Removeobjects that collect dust (e.g. stuffed animals) from the bedroom. Consider using a HEPA air filter in the bedroom. Keep humidity in your house between 25 and 50 percent. Encase your mattress and box spring in an airtight cover. Wash bed covers, clothes, and stuffed toys once a week in very hot (130 degrees) water. Keep windo ws closed during seasons when pollen and mold are highest. Avoid sources of molds (wet leaves, garden debris). Keep animals out of the house, or at least away from the sleeping areas. Remove carpets from your bedroom. Do not use perfume or cologne. Eliminate r oaches fr om the home. Exercise is one trigger that you should not avoid. With the right asthma plan, almost every person with asthma should be fully active and be able to play any sport. Since animal dander, especially from cats, can be an asthma trigger, it is a good ideas to keep animals outof the house, or at least away from the sleeping areas.YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE Lung Conditions10What can I do to Manage My Asthma? There are several things you can do to live a normal, active life. 1. You should first work out an effective plan with your doctor. You may need to be evaluated by an allergist for testing and treatment of underlying allergies that can trigger asthma.Your doctor will recommend that you use a Peak Flow Meter. A Peak Flow Meter measures the fastest speed at which you can blow air out of your lungs. You will need to keep a daily diary of your Peak Flow readings. Your doctor will instruct you how often to perform a peak flo w, and help you create a plan to treat your asthma based on your peak flow scores. 2. When you have an asthma plan worked out by your doctor, make sure to follow the plan and take allmedications as prescribed. If you find you are usingyour rescue inhalers more than recommended, it istime to call your doctor to re-evaluate your treatment plan. 3. Watch for warning signs that an asthma episode may be on the way.How do I use a Peak Flow Meter? 1.Remove gum or food from your mouth and move the pointer to zero 2. Stand up, and hold the meter horizontally with your fingers away from the vent holes and the marker 3.Take a deep breath 4. Put the mouthpiece inside your mouth on your tongue and close your lips snug around themouthpiece - your doctor may recommend you usenose clips also 5. Blow out as hard and as fast as you can stand up (a short, sharp blast) 6. Note your number 7. Move the pointer to zero and wait at least 15 seconds 8. Repeat above steps two more times9. Mark your best score on your peak flow diary Children under the age of five may not be able to blow the peak flow reliably. They should use a diary that is based on signs of asthma. What if I have an Asthma Episode (Attack)? 1. Stay calm and relaxed 2. Follow your emergency treatment plan3. DO NOT drink a lot of water - just drink normal amounts 4. DO NO T breathe warm, moist air from a shower 5. DO NO Tre-breathe into a paper bag held o ver the nose 6. DO NOT use nonprescription medicines without first calling the doctor Prognosis and Expectations for Asthma Aperson with asthma can expect to: Be active without having asthma symptoms - this includes ex ercise and sports. Prevent asthma episodes. Avoid side effects from asthma medicines. ASTHMA: Living a Normal Life Aperson with asthma can live a nor mal life with pr oper tr eatment. Following your asthma plan is ver y important as well as keeping a good line of communication with your doctor. swollen li ningbronchia lmuscle s pasm trapped airmucus Lung Conditions YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE11ICHRONIC BRONCHITIS What is Chronic Bronchitis? Chronic Bronchitis is an inflammation of the lining of your bronchial tubes. They become inflamed (swollen) and this causes them to make too much mucus. This can be brought on by: Cigarette smoke (the most common cause). Air pollution. Industrial dust and fumes. Allergens. What Causes Chronic Bronchitis? Once the bronchial tubes have been irritated over a long period of time it becomes har der to breathe, and the extra mucus causes chronic coughing and wheezing. Some airways may even be blocked by extra mucus causing an obstruction. When this happens you are more likely to have lung infections. Treatment for Chr onic B ronchitis Antibiotics can cur ebacterial infections but they can' tcurechronic bronchitis. The best way to stop the pr ogression of chronic bronchitis is to: 1. Avoid the irritant causing the disease (especially cigarette smoke) QUIT SMOKING! 2. Drink plenty of fluids. 3. Keep your lungs cleared of mucus. 4.Take the medications y ou areprescribed.WHO GETS CHRONIC BRONCHITIS? More than 11 million Americans are diagnosed with chronic bronchitis annually. Theprevalence rate of chronicbronchitis has been consistently higher in females than in males. Chronic bronchitis affects people of all ages, but is higher in people over 45 years of age. Nomatter what their occupation or lifestyle, people who smoke cigarettes are mostlikely to develop chronic bronchitis. Workers with certain jobs, especially those involving high concentrations of dust and irritating fumes, are also at high risk ofdeveloping this disease. Higher rates of chronic bronchitis are found among coal miners, grain handlers,metal molders, and other workers exposed to dust. Symptoms of chronic bronchitis worsen whenatmospheric concentrations of sulfur dioxide and other air pollutants increase. These symptoms are intensified inindividuals who smoke. lining swollen li ningnormal bronchial tube chronic bronchi tismucus Thickened li ning YOUR LIFE Lung Conditions12IEMPHYSEMA What is Emphysema? Emphysema is a disease usually caused by smoking or second hand smoke, but sometimes it can be genetic. Emphysema destr oys the air sacs in your lung (SEE PICTURE AT RIGHT) causing airwayblockage. Several things happen with Emphysema: 1. The transfer of oxygen and carbon dioxide does not exchange evenly throughout your body. 2. Extra pr essureis needed to exhale. Your body has to work harder to exhale due to the damaged lung sacs that do not snap closed, causing air to be trapped and br eathing to be dif ficult. I t is easy for air to enter into your lungs, but not so easy for it to get out. 3. Thick mucus may be trapped making it easy for infections to develop. 4. Shortness of breath is the hallmark of, or primary symptom of emphysema. ICYSTIC FIBROSIS (CF) What is a chr onic, inherited disease that causes the body to make thick, sticky mucus. Cystic Fibrosis primarily affects the respirator yand digestive systems in children and young adults. On average, individuals with Cystic Fibr osis have a lifespan of approximately 30 years. What ar ethe Symptoms of C ystic F ibrosis? Cystic Fibr osis does not follow the same pattern in all patients. It affects different people in different ways and degrees. Poor growth,malnutrition, frequent respiratory infections, persistent diarrhea,bulky foul-smelling and greasy stools, chronic cough with thickmucus, salty-tasting skin or frequent wheezing are some of thesymptoms a person with Cystic Fibrosis may experience.POINTS TO REMEMBER ABOUT CYSTIC FIBROSIS Parents should treat their children with CF as normallyas possible. Family and friends should remember that CF is notcontagious. CF parents should not feel guilty or responsible for causing their child's disease; they could not haveprevented it. In families with CF, brothers, sisters, and first cousins of the CF patient should betested to see if they carry the defective gene. Patients and families should workclosely with doctors and other medical specialists to dev elop self-management skills that can improve quality of life. Above all, CF patients and their families should keep a positive attitude. Scientists continue to make advances in understanding CF. Theoutlook is bright for further improvements in the car eof CF patients and even for the discovery of a cure. cysticfibrosist lining colla pses floppy air sacs (al veoli)trapped air trapped air trapped air lining swollen li nnormal bronchial tube chronic bronchi LUNGS YOUR LIFE13How is Cystic Fibrosis Diagnosed? The most common test for Cystic Fibrosis is called the sweat test. It measures the amount of salt (sodiumchloride) in the sweat. An area of skin (usually the forearm) is made to sweat using a chemical and applying amild electric current. After 30-40 minutes, the sweat is collected and analyzed. Higher than normal amounts of sodium and chloride suggests cystic fibrosis. Additional test may include: The IRT test may be used on newborns - this is a blood test. Chest X-rays. Lung function tests. Sputum cultures. Stool examinations. How is Cystic Fibrosis Treated? Currently, there is not a treatment for the basic cause of CF, though several drug-based approaches are being investigated. The goal of tr eatment is to keep the lungs clear of mucus and free of infection. Antibiotics. Chest therapy with postural drainage. Exercise. Aerosol medications: bronchodilators and mucolytics -also, enzyme or may be used. Decongestants. Diet of w ell-balanced, high-caloric foods, lo win fat and high in pr otein. Vitamins A, D, E, and K supplements. Prognosis of Cystic Fibrosis Cystic Fibrosis was once fatal in childhood. Better treatment methods have increased the average lifespan to nearly 30 years. IBRONCHIECTASIS What is B ronchiectasis? Bronchiectasis is an abnormal stretching and widening of the large airways. A person may be born with it(congenital bronchiectasis) or may acquire it in life later due to chronic infections. What are the Symptoms of Bronchiectasis? Symptoms may include: Chronic cough with large amounts of foul smelling sputum production. Coughing up blood. Cough worsened by lying on one side.Shortness of breath worsened by exercise. Weight loss. Fatigue. Clubbing of fingers may be present (abnormal amount of tissue in the fingernail beds). Wheezing. Skin discoloration, bluish. Paleness. Breath odor. How is Bronchiectasis Diagnosed? Tests may be done which include: Chest x-ray. Sputum culture. Blood test may reveal anemia and differential may show evidence of fungus infection. Serum immunoglobulin analysis. Serum precipitins (testing for antibodies to the fungus, aspergillus). PPD (purified pr otein deriv ative) skin test for prior TB infection. Treatment and Prognosis for Bronchiectasis Diagnosis may be done by a variety of test including chest x-ray and a sputum culture. Treatment is designed to pr event complications. The most impor tant part of treatment can be done at home by lear ning to use gravity to help drain lung secr etions. This can be done by using pillows on the bed to position your lungs below the rest of your body. You can get a family member to assist with chest per cussion by hand or a mechanical precursor. A doctor or respiratorytherapist can instr uct you on how to do this. Early treatment of infections with antibiotics can also prevent complications. Daily postural drainage and chest clapping, antibiotics, with a back-up of appropriate medical care can prevent most complications. IOBSTR UCTIVE SLEEP APNEA What is Sleep Apnea? Sleep apnea is a disor der in which a person stops breathing for short periods during sleep. This may happen frequently. Warning signs include: Loud snoring, pauses in br eathing follo wed by gasps. Falling asleep at inappr opriate times such as while driving, at movies or at work. Early morning headaches. Trouble concentrating, for getfulness, irritability , depression, loss of inter est in sex.YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE Lung Conditions14Left untreated, people are at risk for high blood pressure, heart attack, heart failure stroke, depression and car accidents. Ifyou or your sleep partner suspects you have sleep apnea, see your physician. Treatments are available. DISEASES OF THE INTERSTITIUM In interstitial lung disease, lung tissues are damaged, become inflamed and eventually become scarred or fibrotic, resulting in stiff lungs. The lung tissues may have been damaged in known or unknown ways. Thisfibrosis impairs the lungs ability to provide oxygen to the body's tissues. Classifying Pulmonary Fibrosis Therearesix categories to describe the causes of pulmonar yfibrosis. The first category is occupational and environmental exposures to dusts, chemicals, gases, fumes, vapors, paraquat and irradiation. Exposure of certain drugs and poisons, such as chemotherapeuticagents, antibiotics and miscellaneous medications is the second category. The third category involves Connective Tissue Diseases and the fourth category is OtherSystemic Diseases. Infections, the fifth category, includes the residual of active infection of any type. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, the final and most common of thecategories, originates from unknown factors. Facts Equal numbers of men and women are diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis and most are between 40 and 70 years of age. Survival rate averages between 4 to 6 years after diagnosis. Symptoms Symptoms of pulmonar yfibrosis include shortness of breath, incr eased shor tness of br eath with activity or exercise, a dry cough, and low oxygen levels in the blood. It may be easier for the person to get an infection; theymay develop clubbed finger nails and hear tfailur ewith swelling of their legs and hands. Diagnosis Adoctor may diagnose this problem with a careful patient history and physical and may order several testsand procedures to help confirm the diagnosis. The testsand procedures include blood tests, chest x-rays and CTscans, pulmonar yfunction tests, br onchoalveolar lavage, and open lung biopsy.Treatment While there is no cure for pulmonary fibrosis, this serious condition can be treated in several ways. The physician may prescribe medications, such as prednisonetodecrease inflammation of the lung tissue, or other drugs. The person will be encouraged to get vaccinationsagainst influenza and pneumonia regularly. Wearingoxygen may be prescribed to help maintain adequate oxygen levels in the blood. Exercise is necessary to keep muscles at their most efficient. Quite often, enrolling inPulmonary Rehabilitation as an outpatient is encouraged so that the person may get the needed pulmonary education and exercise in a safe, monitored environment while receiving the proper amounts of oxygen. The physician may order an evaluation at a transplant center for possible lung transplantation. Risk Factors Certain habits, conditions, practices or exposures may increase the risk of developing pulmonary fibrosis.Cigar ette smoking, taking cer tain medications, exposur e to certain infections, environmental and e, chr onic aspiration fr om gastr oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and family genetics may contribute to an increased risk for pulmonary fibrosis. Research Research into the causes and treatment of pulmonary fibrosis is going on all the time in university medical centers all around the world. Both older and newermedications are being studied to see if they can lessen the severity and the symptoms of this serious lung condition. Resources Further detailed information about pulmonary fibrosis is available in many places, including libraries and websites on the inter net. Ask your physician or your health educator about the best and most cur rent information available.

Lung Conditions YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE15DISORDERS OF GAS/BLOOD EXCHANGE IRESPIRATORY FAILURE Normally we breathe oxygen into the lungs and exhale carbon dioxide out of the lungs. Respiratory failure happens when one or both of these functionsare hindered and the oxygen in the blood becomesdangerously low or the level of carbon dioxidebecomes dangerously high. IPULMONARY EDEMA Pulmonary edema is usually caused by heart failure that results in increased pressure in the pulmonary (lung) veins. Symptoms may include shortness of breath and coughing up pink tinged or white frothysputum. IPULMONARY EMBOLUS Pulmonary embolus is a condition in which the pulmonar yartery is blocked. This blockage can occur from a blood clot, a fatty deposit, an air bubble that travels fr om another location in the body .Symptoms include: sudden, incr eased shortness of breath and fast hear trate. T reatments include giving medication to dissolve the clot, and at times sur gically r emoving the blockage. IACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME Acute Respirator yDistress Syndrome (ARDS) is diagnosed based on symptoms, such as severe shortness of breath, low oxygen in the tissues or infiltrate lung markings on a chest film. Numerous underlying conditions can lead to ARDS and can range from blood-borne infections to major trauma.This syndrome is usually managed by providingoxygen and proper ventilation to the patient by means of a mechanical ventilator. IPULMONAR YHYPERTENSION Pulmonar yHyper tension is a disorder in the lungs, in which the ar teries in the lungs have nar rowed, making it difficult for blood to flow through. It is essentially high blood pressure in the arteries thatsupply the lungs. The blood vessels that supply thelungs constrict and the vessels cannot car ryasmuch blood. The continuous high pressure causes thehear tto work har der; less blood goes through thelungs to pick up fresh oxygen. Symptoms are fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath. Supplementaloxygen and other medications help treat this condition. ICOR PULMONALE Cor pulmonale is a disorder that slows or blocks blood flow in the lungs. This raises blood pressureand leads to congestive heart failure. Cor pulmonale is right-sided heart failure caused by other lung diseases. Cor pulmonale differs from left-sided heart failure in that the lungs do not fill with fluid. Symptoms include: shortness of breath (specifically with exertion, fatigue, fainting, chest pain, and swelling in the legs). Treatment often includes diuretics (medicine to reduce swelling) and other cardiac medications. DISEASE OF THE PLEURA IPLEURAL EFFUSION Pleural ef fusion is the abnormal accumulation of fluid between the chest wall and the lining that covers thelungs. Shor tness of breath is a common symptom. A thoracentesis is a pr ocedur eusing a needle to drain the abnor mal fluid. Fluid can be collected and sent to a lab for testing. If a large amount of fluid is present, thephysician can place a tube into the chest wall to drain the fluid over time. Pleural ef fusions may result secondary to other medical conditions, such as pneumonia, congestive heart failure, tuberculosis, orlung tumors. IEMPYEMA Empyema is an infection in the membranes that surround the lungs. Symptoms include fever, lethargy, fatigue, weight loss, chest pain and shortness of breath.Treatment may include antibiotics or surgery. IPNEUMOTHORAX Pneumothorax is the presence of air in the membrane that surrounds the lungs. When punctured or pierced, airfrom the lungs will enter the space. Symptoms includeshortness of breath and chest discomfort. Pneumothoraxcan occur after a surgical procedure or chest trauma.Apneumothorax can develop from unknown reasons, as well. Treatment involves assessing the air leak from a chest film, or placement of a tube into the chest to relieve the trapped air.YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE Lung Conditions16INFECTIONS IPNEUMONIA Pneumonia is a serious infection of the air sacs of the lungs. This infection can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi or protozoa. The lungs fill with infection and can make getting enough oxygen from the air difficult. Contact your doctor if you have chills, fever, persistent cough, sputum production that may be yellow, green, or rust color, chest pain or shortness of breath. These are some of the most often seen signs. The diagnosis of pneumonia is made by chest X-ray, sputum culture for bacterial growth, and a thoroughexamination and history by your doctor. The tr eatment for bacterial pneumonia is early antibiotics. V iral infections are not treated with antibiotics. Other tr eatments are rest, fluids to prevent dehydration fr om fever ,medication for sever ecough, chest pain, fever ,and supplemental oxygen if blood oxygen is low. Often, breathing treatments to open the airways with an inhaled form of medication will be ordered. Prevention is often possible with a yearly influenza shot given in the fall. A pneumonia vaccine is available to fight pneumococcal pneumonia for high-risk patients. The most important preventive measure is good healthhabits, proper diet and hygiene, plenty of rest, regular exercise and stress management. During flu season, it is wise to avoid large crowds and people who are coughing frequently. Always wash your hands frequently. If you develop symptoms, don't wait. Call your doctor and get treatment early. Follow his orders and take all of your medication until it is gone to prevent relapse. ITUBER CULOSIS Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection, usually in the lungs, caused by the Mycobacterium tuber culosis bacteria. It isairborne, and spread by an infected person sneezing or coughing, then unknowingly inhaled by others they contact. The disease usually infects the lungs, but canspread to other parts of the body. It is a worldwide health problem, but is better controlled in the United States because of our accessibility to health car e, testing and treatment. The skin test for TB is done frequently for health care workers and people traveling outside of the countr y. It is also done for people who exhibit symptoms or have beenexposed to the disease. If the skin test is positive, it doesnot always mean an active infection of tuberculosis.Some people carry inactive tuberculosis germs from a previous exposure, but have no active disease. If the PPD skin test is positive, you will need a physical examination, chest X-ray, and sometimes sputumcultures to determine if you have an active disease. The symptoms are usually cough, fatigue, weight loss, low- grade fever, night sweats, or chest pain. Some infectedpatients have only mild or no symptoms, and are not aware they have the disease. Apatient diagnosed with active disease is usually treated with a medication called Isoniazid for six months or more, and followed up with regular check-ups. There are other medications also available that may be used. IOTHER INFECTIONS Acommon respiratory infection is influenza, or flu. There are many different virus strains that cause the flu, and most occur in the winter months. Most people recover fr om the flu quickly, but those with chronic diseases will often develop complications, which lead to further illness. Histoplasmosis infection comes from exposure to infected birds, bats, or chicken droppings. It is morecommon in war m, moist environments and is usually a mild disease, but may leave scars on the lungs, which will show on X-rays. LUNG MASSES &LUNG CANCER Tumors in the lung can be benign or malignant. The factors that contribute to lung cancer are cigarettesmoking, occupation, heredity and environment. Benign tumors (or non-cancer ous lung tumors) account for only about 10% of the occurrences. Thecancerous lung tumors are either primary (those whichoriginate in the lung) or metastatic (a r esult of the spread of a malignancy from another site in the body). The incidence of primary lung cancer is 10 times higher in cigarette smokers. Unfortunately, most lung masses arenot discover ed until late in the disease. The treatment for lung cancer depends on the type of cell causing the disease and the stage of advancement.Surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation is the most commontype of treatment.

BRAND NAME MEDICINES: A \"brand name\" is a product name that a manufacturer has registered for copyrightprotection. The term \"generic\" refers to the chemical substance of theproduct without reference to the manufacturer. St. John'scarries only generics that theUnited S tates F ood and D rug Administration has determined to be equiv alent for all practical purposes to the trade-named product.For some brand nameproducts, no suitable substitutes are These Medicines Work Beta2-agonists are bronchodilator medicines that open airways by relaxing the muscles in and around theairways that tighten during an attack of shortness of breath. How Are They Prescribed Beta2-agonists come in many forms. There are also many ways to take them.Beta2-agonists can be: Inhaled using a metered dose inhaler Inhaled using a nebulizer A powder-filled capsule that is inhaled by using a device called a dr ypowder inhaler Swallowed as a liquid or tablet, or Taken as shots Inhaled beta2-agonists stop symptoms of COPD and asthma episodes. They are sometimes used in smalldoses (no more than three to four times a day) to keepdaily symptoms under control. Side Effects Side effects include rapid heart beat, tremors, feeling anxious, and nausea. These side ef fects tend to leave as the body adjusts to the medicine. Serious side effects are rare, but may include chest pain, fast or irregular heartbeat, severe headache or feeling dizzy, very bad nausea, or vomiting. Call your doctor right away if you have any of these symptoms. Notes Inhaled medicines are the first choice. They begin to work within fiv eminutes and hav efewer side effects. The medicine goes right to the lungs and does not easily go into the rest of the body. Liquids or tablets begin to work within 30 minutes and lastas long as four to six hours. A holding chamber or spacer device (a tube attached to the inhaler) can be attached to the inhaler to make it easier touse and can help arthritic or elderly patients use a metered dose inhaler. Using a nebulizer to take the medicine works the same way asusing an inhaler. A nebulizer is easier to use than an inhaler. It is good for a child under age 5, for a patient who has trouble using an inhaler, or for a patient with severeshortness of breath. Beta2-agonists relieve symptoms, but they cannot reduce or prevent the swelling or inflammation that causes thesymptoms. When you have to use a beta2-agonist to relieve symptoms every day or if you use it more than three or four times in a single day, your COPD may be getting much worse. You may need another kind of medicine, andyou need to discuss this with your doctor right ISerevent\u00aeDiskus\u00ae(salmeterol xinafoate), Brovana and salmeter ol) and in Advair HFA HowDo These Medicines Work It lasts up to 12 hours and may be particularly useful for people with COPD who have nighttime breathingproblems. It is important to note that, unlike the short- acting beta2-agonists described above, all long acting beta2-agonists should NOT be taken to relieve an attackof shortness of breath. It does not provide rapid relief of your COPD symptoms. Instead, they should be used on aregular basis, all currently available long-acting beta2- agonist's are dosed twice daily). Side Effects Side effects from long-acting beta2-agonists may include shakiness, headache, ner vousness, high Medicine Work Atrovent (ipratropium) and Spiriva (tiotiopium) another type of bronchodilator. They open up the air passages by relaxing the smooth muscles in the wall of the breathing tubes (bronchi) and makes the airways wider just like the beta bronchodilators (Proventil, Ventolin, albuterol) do. This allows air to move in and out of the lungs more easily. Anticholinergics works in adifferent way than the beta bronchodilators so its effects are not as quick as the beta bronchodilators. However, they begin to work within about 15 to 30 minutes.Atrovent is a reliever, lasting 4-6 hours. Spiriva is amaintenance medication lasting a day and a half for each dose. They are usually used in people who have smoking-related diseases of chronic bronchitis and emphysema. As a rule, they are not useful in asthma. How They Are Prescribed Anticholinergics are prescribed as metered dose inhalers, powder inhaler or as a solution for a nebulizer. Side Effects Side effects may include dryness of mouth, cough, dizziness, headache, feeling anxious or ner vous, nausea, heart palpitations and temporary blurring of vision if sprayed into eyes. Notes Anticholinergics will cause temporary blurring of vision if it accidentally gets spray ed into the ey es. Anticholinergics may be used alone or in combination with other br onchodilator inhalers Since Anticholinergics have a slower onset than many other inhaled bronchodilators, they are generally NOT used in an emergency. Combivent (Atrovent and Albuterol combined), may be used as well. Medications IIntal (cromolyn sodium) How Do These Medicines Work Cromolyn stabilizes the airways and aids in preventing swelling of the airways. Because of this action, it issometimes called a pr eventer medicine. Since it is a preventive medicine, it will not help immediately in anasthma episode. It needs to be given regularly to be effective. What Form Does It Come In It comes in a metered dose inhaler (puffer), a solution for abreathing nebulizer machine or a spinhaler. What Are The Advantages and Disadvantages of the Different Forms There is no oral form of cromolyn or nedocromil. Metered dose inhalers require exact coordination and can be used in adults and older children. Spinhalers deliver cromolyn in powder from. The difference betweenthe spinhaler and metered dose inhaler (MDI) is that the MDI delivers a pre-set amount of medicine whenpressed. You must start a breath and press the canister at the same time. The spinhaler doesn't start delivering the medicine until you start your breath. The spinhaler issometimes easier to use and actually delivers a higher dose of medicine than the MDI. Serevent, Foradil, Advair and Spiriva ar edrypowders as well. Side Effects There are virtually no side effects with cromolyn or nedocr omil. Occasionally ,there may be dry cough, hoarseness or a bad taste in the mouth. This can beeliminated by drinking orange juice or a carbonatedbeverage after you take your dose. Using a spacer devicealso will help decrease the taste. How Do These Medicines Work These medicines act on the sur face of the air ways. Over a period of time, they reduce swelling and inflammation and allow other medicines to work better . It is impor tant to use these medications r egularly as directed in order to be effective. Inhaled steroids are preventive medicines and will not help during a sudden attack of tightness or wheezing. Inhaled ster oids are also called \"pr Prednisone, Decadron In What Form Do They Come Tablet, oral liquid, and solution for injection. Are Oral Steroids Safe Oral steroids can safely be given for short intervals up to twice a year with little or no side effects. However, long use over a period of months to years can produce some side effects in the body. Side Effects Short term use: Upset stomach, swelling, weight gain, fluid retention, mood swings, rounding of the face, sleep difficulties and better appetite. These will go away after the medicine has stopped. Long term use: Cataracts, brittle bones, stunted growth, high blood pressure, muscle weakness. You should not stop taking this medicine without first talking to your health care provider. Notes Follow your health care provider's directions about how to take (or give your child) the \"burst\" or short term dosing of steroids. When oral ster oids are used to treat an asthma attack, they take about thr ee hours to wor kand ar emost ef fectivein six to 12 hours. Take oral ster oids with food to decr ease stomach irritation Try eating high fiber ,low calorie food, (carrots, celery, etc..) if you crave food while on oral steroids. Limit your intake of salt or sodium which causes you to retain water if fluid retention is a problem while taking oral steroids. These steroids are not the same as steroids used by some athletes. Short term side effects do not damage your liver. Inhaled Steroids They come in metered dose inhalers or dry powder. Side Effects Because the inhaled steroids act on the surface of the airways, far fewer side effects occur than with the oralsteroids. However, some less severe side effects can occur. These include cough, hoarseness, and thrush, which is a yeast infection of the mouth and throat that appears as white patches. What Can Be Done To Prevent The Side Effects To prevent the hoarseness and thrush, it is important to rinse your mouth and spit after each use. A spacer device is recommended for all who take inhaled steroids. These devices allow the larger particles of medicine tosettle and only the smaller ones remain which are then carried into the lungs. Azmacort comes with its own spacer device. Medications IZafirlukast (Accolate) ,Montelukast (Singulair), Zileuton (Z yflo) How Do These Medicines Work Unlike steroids which block the entire inflammatory process, leukotriene inhibitors and antagonists block aspecific inflammatory pathway in asthma. Leukotrienes are one of the chemicals produced when the body has an inflammatory response. When a person with asthma isexposed to a trigger, these chemicals are responsible for the air way tightening and swelling and the increased production of mucus. The leukotriene inhibitor antagonist medications block or inhibit the action of these chemicals. How Are They Prescribed One of the big advantages of these medications is that they ar etaken orally ,usually a single tablet one to two times per day .They need to be taken ever yday whether you are having symptoms or not. These medications prove to be mor ebeneficial when used in combination with inhaled ster oids for asthma management. These medications are approved by the FDA for the treatment of asthma. They are not approved by the FDA for the treatment of COPD, however ,your doctor may evaluate you for the usefulness of these drugs on an individual basis. Notes Take medication on a daily basis, even if you feel good. It can be taken safely with other asthma medicines.ILEUKOTRIENE INHIBITORS & ANTAGONISTS (PREVENTERS) Medicines YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE23 Accolate should be taken one hour before or two hours after meals. Singulair should be taken in the evening and may be taken without regard to food. Accolate affects the levels of the blood thinner, Coumadin. If you are taking this medication, the dosage of Coumadin may need to be adjusted by your health care provider. Bloodtests need to be checked when on Zyflo as it may effect liver function. Side Effects All medications can cause unwanted side effects in some people. In clinical trials where tests were performed on patients taking these drugs, theleukotrieine inhibitors and antagonists were usually well tolerated. The most common side effects reported were headache and nausea. Medications ISlo-bid ,Theo-Dur ,Theo-24 ,Slo-phyllin (liquid) How Does This Medicine Work These medications are a weaker bronchodilator compar ed to the Beta agonist and Anticholinegics. In some cases, your doctor may want to add these medications to a regime to obtain better contr ol of br onchospasm. Theophylline comes in tablet, capsule, liquid, andintravenous forms. Do not chew theophylline tablets or capsules because too much of the time-r eleased medicine will be released all at once. Theophylline capsules may be opened and sprinkled on a small amount of sweet, softfood, such as yogur t, jelly ,or honey to disguise the taste, but do not chew the beads that are in the capsule. Do not mix theophylline with hot food. This will dissolve themedicine and release too much in the body. It is best totake theophylline on an empty stomach (one hour befor e or two hours after a meal) with a full glass of water. However ,if it upsets your stomach, ask your health care provider if you may take it with food. The dosages on each will vary depending on your needs. Follow the dosage yourhealth car eprovider or dered for you. Side Effects Side ef fects ar emorecommon than for the other inhalers, and may include r estlessness, ner vousness, upset stomach, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite,headache, insomnia, fast heartbeat and seizures.Notes Theophylline must be taken regularly and spaced evenly over a24-hour period. It usually takes about three days for the medication to reach the ideal level in your blood. Your health care provider may find it helpful to monitor the levels of theophylline. Keep your appointments for blood work. Nevertake extra doses of theophylline unless instructed to do so by your health care provider. Avoid large amounts of coffee, tea, colas, cocoa and chocolate. These foods may increase the stimulant effect of the medications since they all contain a chemical with effects similar to theophylline. Excessive side effects may mean there is too much medicine in your blood. Call your health care provider. Certain medications increase the amount of theophylline in your blood. Such medications include Tagamet, erythromycin,Cipro, and others. Always discuss the medication you are taking (including over-the-counter and \"natural\" medicines) with your health care provider when new medicines are being prescribed. If you have a fever, flu, or a lot of swelling in your feet or legs, notify your health care provider. In these situations, your health care provider may want to adjust your theophylline dosage. Do not change brands of theophylline (like switching to a generic brand) without first checking with your health care provider. Avoid smoking since it can make y our asthma worse and can affect the amount of theophylline in your blood. Contact y our health car eprovider if you start or stop smoking while inhaler seems simple but it is more difficult than it looks. In fact, most patients do not use it the rightway at first. With incorrect use, less medicine gets into your lungs and you won't be getting the full benefit of your medication. Follow these simple suggestions if you ar enot familiar with the steps. Read them aloud as you do them or have someone read them to you. This helps you remember all the steps. Once you are more comfortable with the steps,have your health care provider check to make sure you are using your inhaler the right way. Foradil and Sprivia require the insertion of a capsule, containing powder, into theinhaler. ITHEOP HYLLINE BRONCHODILATOR (LONG-ACTING RELIEVER) ICORRECT USE OF A DRY POWDER INHALER (DPI) YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE Medicines24GENERAL STEPS FOR USING THE INHALER 1.Remove the cap and hold the inhaler upright 2. Turn base to right and return back to left until you hear a\"click\" 3. Tilt your head back slightly to open your airway 4. Take a deep breath in and then breathe all the way out 5. Inhale deeply and forcefully one to three seconds - hold in an upright or horizontal position when inhaling 6. Hold breath for 10 seconds 7. Repeat as directed, waiting 60 seconds between puffs. 8. Rinse mouth after administration to reduce side effects Notes The medicine may taste slightly sweet because of the dry powder carrier for the drug A \"low-dose\" indicator will appear on the side of the device when 20 doses remain (for some of these only). Using a metered dose inhaler is a good way to take asthma medicines. There are few side effects because the medicine goes right to the lungs and not to other parts of the body. It takes only five to 10 minutes for the medicine to have an ef fect compar ed to liquid asthma medicines, which can take one to thr ee hours. Inhalers can be used by all asthma patients age five and older. A spacer or holding chamber attached to the inhaler canhelp make taking the medicine easier for even younger children. These devices are helpful to people having trouble using an inhaler. The inhaler must be cleaned often to pr event buildup that will clog it and reduce how well it works. The guidelines that follow will help you usethe inhaler the right way .Ask your doctor or nurse to show you how to use the inhaler. Using the I nhaler 1. Remove the cap and hold the inhaler upright 2. Shake the inhaler 3. Tilt your head back slightly and breathe out 4. Use the inhaler in any one of these ways (A is the best way, but C is okay if you are having trouble with AorB.) A. Open mouth with inhaler one to two inches awayB. Use spacer C. In the mouth 5. Press down on the inhaler to r elease the medicine as you star tto br eathe in slowly6. Breathe in slowly for three to five seconds 7.Hold your breath for 10 seconds to allow the medicine to reach deeply into your lungs 8. Repeat puffs as prescribed - waiting one minute between puffs may permit the second puff to go deeper into the lungs Note: Dry powder capsules are used differently. To use a dry powder inhaler, close your mouth tightly around themouthpiece and inhale very fast. CLEANING 1. Once a day clean the inhaler and cap by rinsing it in warm running water. Let it dry before you use it again. Have another inhaler to use while it is drying 2. Twice a week wash the plastic mouthpiece with mild dishwashing soap and warm water. Rinse and dry well before putting it back CHECKING HOW MUCH MEDICINE IS LEFT IN THE CANISTER 1. If the canister is new, it is full 2. An easy way to check the amount of medicine left in your metered dose inhaler is to place the canister inacontainer of water and obser ve the position it takes in the water Spacers Unless you use your inhaler the right way, much of the medicine may end up on your tongue, on the back ofyour throat, or in the air. Use of a spacer or holding chamber can help this problem. Aspacer or holding chamber is a device that attaches to a metered dose inhaler. It holds the medicine in itschamber long enough for you to inhale it in one or two slow deep breaths. The spacer makes it easy for you to use the medicines the right way (especially if your child is young or you have a hard time just using an inhaler). It helps you not cough when using an inhaler. A spacer will also help pr event you fr om getting a yeast infection in your mouth (thrush) when taking inhaled steroid medicines. There are many models of spacers or holding chambers that you can purchase through your pharmacist or a medical supply company. Ask your doctor about the different models. How to Use a Spacer 1. Attach the inhaler to the spacer or holding chamber as explained by your doctor or by using the directionsthat come with the pr oduct. 2. Shake well3. Press the button on the inhaler - this will put one puff of the medicine in the holding chamberIUSING A METERED DOSE INHALER Medicines YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE254. Place the mouthpiece of the spacer in your mouth and inhale slowly. (A face mask may be helpful for a young child.) 5. Hold your breath for few seconds and then exhale. Repeat steps 4 and 5 two more times 6. If your doctor has prescribed two puffs, wait between puffs for the amount of time he or she has directedand repeat steps 4 and 5 Use and Care of a Nebulizer Anebulizer is a device driven by a compressed air machine. It allows you to take medicine in the form of a mist (wet aerosol). It consists of a cup, a mouthpiece attached to a T-shaped part or a mask, and then plastic tubing to connect to the compressed air machine. IT IS USED MOSTLY BY THESE TYPES OF PATIENTS: Young children under age five. Patients who have problems using metered dose inhalers. Patients with severe lung disease. Anebulizer helps make sur ethey get the right amount of medicine. Aroutine for cleaning the nebulizer is impor tant because an unclean nebulizer may cause an infection. Agood cleaning routine keeps the nebulizer from cloggingup and helps it last longer . Directions for using the compressed air machine may vary(check the machine' sdirections), but generally the tubing has to be put into the outlet of the machine before it is turned on. How to Use a Nebulizer 1. Measure the correct amount of normal saline solution using a clean dropper and put it into the cup. If yourmedicine is premixed, go to step 3 2. Draw up the correct amount of medicine using a clean eyedropper or syringe and put it into the cup with the saline solution. Once you know your number of drops,you can count them as a check on yourself 3. Fasten the mouthpiece to the T-shaped part and then fasten this unit to the cup OR fasten the mask to thecup. For a child over the age of two, use a mouthpiece unit because it will deliver mor emedicine than a mask 4. Put the mouthpiece in your mouth. Seal your lips tightly around it OR place the mask on your face 5. Turn on the air compressor machine 6. Take slow ,deep br eaths in thr ough the mouth 7. Hold each br eath one to two seconds befor ebreathing out 8. Continue until the medicine is gone fr om the cup (appr oximately 10 minutes) 9. Store the medicine as directed after each useCleaning the Nebulizer Don't forget: Cleaning and getting rid of germs prevents infection. Cleaning keeps the nebulizer from clogging up and helps it last longer. After Each Use 1. Remove the mask or the mouthpiece and T-shaped part from the cup. Remove the tubing and set it aside.The tubing should not be washed or rinsed. Rinse the mask or mouthpiece and T-shaped part\u2014as well as the eyedropper or syringe\u2014in warm running water for 30seconds. Use distilled or sterile water for rinsing, if possible 2. Shake off excess water - air dry on a clean cloth or paper towel 3. Put the mask or the mouthpiece and T-shaped part, cup, and tubing back together and connect the device to the compressed air machine. Run the machine for10 to 20 seconds do dry the inside of the nebulizer 4. Disconnect the tugging from the compressed air machine. Store the nebulizer in a ziplock plastic bag 5. Place a cover over the compressed air machine Once Every Day 1. Remove the mask or the mouthpiece and T -shaped partfrom the cup. Remove the tubing and set it aside. The tubing should not be washed or rinsed 2. Wash the mask or the mouthpiece and T-shaped part\u2014as well as the eyedr opper or syringe\u2014with a mild dishwashing soap and warm water 3. Rinse under a strong stream of water for 30 seconds. Use distilled (or sterile) water if possible 4. Shake off excess water. Air dry on a clean cloth or paper towel 5.

Influenza (\"flu\") is a serious disease caused by a virus that spreads from infected persons to the nose or throatof others. Influenza can cause fever, sore throat, chills, cough, headache and muscle aches. Anyone can get influenza. Most people are ill with influenza for only afew days, but some get much sicker and may need to behospitalized. Influenza causes an average of 36,000 deaths each year in the U.S., mostly among the elderly. Influenza vaccine can pr event influenza. Influenza Vaccine Two types of influenza vaccine are now available. Inactivated (killed) influenza vaccine, given as a shot, has been used in the United States for many years. A live, weakened vaccine was licensed in 2003. It is sprayed into the nostrils. Influenza viruses change often. Therefore, influenza vaccine is updated every year. Protection develops about two weeks after getting the shot and maylast up to a year. Some people who get flu vaccine may still get flu, but they will usually get a milder case than those who did not get the shot. Flu vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines, including pneumococcal vaccine. Some inactivated flu vaccine contains thimerosal, a form of mercury, as a preservative. Some contains only a trace ofthimerosal. There is no scientific evidence that thimerosal in vaccines is harmful, and the known benefits of the vaccine outweigh any potential risk fr om thimerosal. If you have questions about thimerosal or reduced-thimer osal flu vaccine, ask your doctor .ICORRECT USE OF DISKUS IINACTIVATED INFLUENZA VACCINEMedicines YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE27Who Should Get Inactivated Influenza Vaccine People six months of age and older at risk for getting a serious case of influenza or influenza complications, and people in close contact with them (including all household members) should get the vaccine. ANANNUAL FLU SHOT IS RECOMMENDED FOR: All children 6-23 months of age. Household contacts and out-of-home caretakers of infants from 0-23 months of age. People 50 years of age or older. Residents of long-term care facilities housing persons with chronic medical conditions. People who have long-term health problems with: -heart disease - kidney disease -lung disease - metabolic disease, such as diabetes -asthma - anemia, and other blood disorders People with a weakened immune system due to: -HIV/AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system -long-term treatment with drugs such as steroids -cancer tr eatment with x-rays or drugs People six months to 18 y ears of age on long-term aspirin treatment (these people could dev elop Reye Syndrome if they got the flu). Women who will be pregnant during influenza season. Physicians, nurses, family members, or anyone else coming in close contact with people at risk of serious influenza. Anyone else who wants to reduce their chance of getting influenza. AN ANNUAL FLU SHOT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR: People who provide essential community services. People at high risk for flu complications who travel to the southern hemisphere between April and September, or who travel to the tropics or in organized tourist groups at any time. People living in dormitories or under other crowded conditions, to pr event outbreaks. When S hould I G et Influenza Vaccine The best time to get a flu shot is in October or November. Some people should get their flu shot in October or earlier. This includes: Younger people at high risk from flu and its complications (including children six through 23 months of age). Household contacts of persons at high risk, Health care workers, and Children under nine years of age getting the flu shot for the first time. Most people need only one flu shot each year to prevent influenza. Childr en under nine years old getting fluvaccine for the first time should get two doses. W ith the inactivated vaccine, these doses ar egiven one monthapart. Children in this age group who got one dose the previous year, even if it was the first time they got thevaccine, need only one dose this year. Some People Should Talk With a Doctor Before Getting Influenza Vaccine TALK WITH A DOCTOR BEFORE GETTING AFLU SHOT IF YOU: ever had a serious allergic reaction to eggs or to a previous dose of influenza vaccine, or have a history of Guillain-Barre' Syndrome (GBS). If you have a fever or are severely ill at the time the shot is scheduled, you should wait until you recover before getting the influenza vaccine. Talk to your doctor or nurse about whether to reschedule the vaccination. What Are the Risks From Inactivated Influenza Vaccine Avaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious pr oblems, such as sever eallergic reactions. The risk of a vaccine causing serious har m, or death, is extremely small. Serious pr oblems fr om inactivated flu vaccine ar every rare. The viruses in inactivated influenza vaccine have been killed, so you cannot get influenza fr om the vaccine. MILD PROBLEMS: Soreness, r edness, or sw elling where the shot was given. Fever. Aches. If these problems occur, they usually begin soon after the shot and last one to two days. SEVERE PROBLEMS: Life-threatening allergic reactions from vaccines are very rare. If they do occur, it is within a few minutes to afew hours after the shot. In 1976, swine flu vaccine was associated with a severe paralytic illness called Guillain-Barre' Syndrome (GBS).Influenza vaccines since then have not been clearly linkedto GBS. However, if there is a risk of GBS from current influenza vaccines, it is estimated at one or two cases per million persons vaccinated... much less than the risk ofsevere influenza, which can be prevented by vaccination. What if There is a Moderate or Severe Reaction - What Should I Look For Any unusual condition, such as a high fever or behavior changes. Signs of a serious allergic reaction caninclude dif ficulty br eathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast hear tbeat or dizziness.YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE Medicines28What Should I Do Call a doctor, or get to a doctor right away. Tell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Askyour doctor, nurse, or health department to report the reaction by filing a Vaccine Adverse Event ReportingSystem (VAERS) form. Or you can file this report through the VAERS web site at www.vaers.org, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS does not provide medical advice. How Can I Learn More Ask your doctor or nurse.

Pneumococcus is the most common bacteria to cause pneumonia in the USA. In fact, pneumococcal disease killsmorepeople in the United States each year than all other vaccine-preventable diseases combined. Anyone can get pneumococcal disease. However, some people are at greater risk from the disease. These include people 65 and older ,the very young, and people with special health problems such as alcoholism, heart or lung disease, kidney failure, diabetes, HIV infection, or certain types of cancer. Pneumococcal disease can lead to serious infections of the lungs (pneumonia), the blood (bacteremia), and thecovering of the brain (meningitis). About one out of every20 people who get pneumococcal pneumonia dies from it, as do about two people out of 10 who get bacteremia and three people out of 10 who get meningitis. People with the special health pr oblems mentioned above ar eeven mor e likely to die from the disease. Drugs such as penicillin were once effective in treating these infections, but the disease has become moreresistant to these dr ugs, making tr eatment of pneumococcal infections more difficult. This makesprevention of the disease through vaccination even more important. Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (PPV) The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) protects against 23 types of pneumococcal bacteria.Most healthy adults who get the vaccine developprotection to most or all of these types within two to three weeks of getting the shot. Very old people, children under two years of age, and people with some long-termillnesses might not respond as well or at all. Who Should Get PPV All adults 65 years of age or older. Anyone over two years of age who has a long-term health problem such as:-heart disease - lung disease -sickle cell disease - diabetes -alcoholism -cirrhosis -leaks of cer ebrospinal fluid Anyone over two years of age who has a disease or condition that lo wers the body 'sresistance to infection, such as: -Hodgkin's failur e -multiple eloma -nephrotic syndrome - HIV infection or AIDS -damaged spleen, or no spleen -organ transplant -long-term steroids - certain cancer drugs -radiation therapy Alaskan N atives and certain Native American populations. How Many Doses of PPV are Needed Usually one dose of PPV is all that is needed. However, under some cir cumstances a second dose may be given. Asecond dose is recommended for those people aged 65 and older who got their first dose when they wer e under 65, if five or mor eyears have passed since that dose.ASECOND DOSE IS ALSO RECOMMENDED FOR PEOPLE WHO: have a damaged spleen or no spleen. havesickle-cell disease. haveHIV infection or AIDS. have cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma. have kidney failure.havenephritic syndr ome. havehad an or gan or bone marr owtransplant. are taking medication that lowers immunity (such as chemotherapy or long-term steroids). Childr en 10 years old and younger may get this second dose thr ee years after the first dose. Those older than 10 should get it five years after the first dose. Other Facts about Getting the Vaccine Other wise healthy childr en who often get earIPNEUMONIA Medicines YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE29infections, sinus infections, or other upper respiratory diseases do not need to get PPV because of these conditions. PPV may be less effective in some people, especially those with lower resistance to infection. These people should still be vaccinated, because they are more likely to get seriously ill from pneumococcal disease. Pregnancy: The safety of PPV for pregnant women has not yet been studied. There is no evidence that the vaccine is harmful to either the mother or the fetus, but pregnant women should consult with their doctor beforebeing vaccinated. If possible, women who are at high risk of pneumococcal disease should be vaccinated before becoming pregnant. What ar ethe Risks of PPV? PPV is a very safe vaccine. About half of those who get the vaccine have very mild side effects, such as redness or pain where the shot is given. Less than 1% develop a fever, muscle aches, or more severe local reactions.Severe allergic reactions have been reported very rarely. As with any medicine, there is a very small risk that serious pr oblems, even death, could occur after getting a vaccine. Getting the disease is much mor elikely to cause serious pr oblems than getting the vaccine.

The blood delivers oxygen to each muscle, organ, and tissue. If lung tissue is damaged, or an infection is present, oxygenation can be impaired.Generally, our bodies use more oxygen walking and exerting, than we do sitting still or at rest. Talking and eating are activities that are considered a resting state,although, surprisingly, these too take oxygen to be ableto perform. Trained medical staff can test the amount of oxygen in your body by using an exter nal machine, called apulse-oximeter, or by drawing blood from an artery. One thing is certain; if the lungs are unable to make enough oxygen for your body, then supplemental oxygen is needed. Supplemental oxygen is given as a treatmentin many dif ferent lung disorders. Home Oxygen Your doctor may order oxygen for use in the home based on tests that determine how much oxygen your body is using at rest and with exertion. Supplementaloxygen is not addicting. It is necessary for life. The use ofoxygen does not lead to an increasing need for oxygen. Supplemental oxygen is a medication and requires a doctor's order. Because oxygen is considered a drug, it isvery important for you to follow the liter flow your doctor has prescribed for you. Do not turn up your oxygen flow without contacting your doctor's office, as higher thannecessary flow could be harmful to some patients.IOXYGEN & YOUR BODY YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE Medicines30The oxygen may cause your nose or mouth to become dry. Do not apply lotion or petroleum jelly to the nasal area. These products areflammable. You may use water based products such as KY jelly or normal saline spray to aid nasal dryness. SAFETY AND OXYGEN 1. Oxygen supports combustion, that means absolutely no smoking! 2. Keep oxygen 10 feet away from an open flame. 3. Oxygen is combustible, when not handled properly it can cause harm 4. Do not use aerosol sprays while wearing oxygen, other than medical inhalers 5. There are several options available to travel with oxygen safely. Traveling with Oxygen Traveling with oxygen requires planning. Be sure to have copies of your oxygen prescription from your doctor. Communicate to your home health oxygen service where you are going and how you are traveling.Ask them the best way to acquire new oxygen when you reach your destination. Some companies have offices across the country. Traveling by Car If traveling by car, place the oxygen tank/unit in a secured holder. The oxygen tank in use can be placed in the front or back seat of the car.Secure the oxygen tank in a seatbelt to avoid shifting. Always keep an extra oxygen tank accessible. Do not store oxygen tanks in the trunk of a car. Smaller portable oxygen concentrators are available for longdistance travel. Traveling by Bus or Train Confirm your travel schedule a few days before departure. Request to be seated in a non-smoking ar ea. Notify staff of your oxygen needs. Traveling by Plane Upon making a reservation, notify the airline of your medical condition and oxygen r equir ements. Personal oxygen tanks ar enot allowed in the cabin of the plane, although airlines will supply an oxygen system for a fee. Airlines will r equir eacopy of your oxygen prescription. Some companies also r equest a medical histor yform. Request a seat in the non-smoking section, if booking an international flight. Consider delays. Allow at least 60 extra minutes of oxygen supply. Individuals should use their own equipment only for boar ding and deplaning the air craft. High elevations can change oxygenation in the body. At high altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is lower and the air is thinner. Discuss your travel plans with your physician to see if you require more external oxygen while in flight. Traveling by Cruise Ship Totravel with oxygen, most ships r equire four to six weeks notice. Be prepared to provide a medical history, oxygen prescription, and a letter from your physician. When making the initial reservation, ask the cruise line their policy on oxygen. You might need to arrange for oxygen tanks/units to be delivered to the cruise ship prior to boarding.SYSTEMS OF OXYGEN FOR HOME USE PRESSURIZED GAS Pressurized gas oxygen is the most common kind of oxygen delivered to the home. Each individual receives a concentrator oxygen machine. A concentrator is an electrically powered device that separates oxygen out ofroom air. A plastic hose delivers oxygen to thenose from the oxygen source. This machine plugs into the electric outlet and makes oxygen constantly. This device requires minor monthlymaintenance, such as cleaning a small air filter. The second device will be a portable oxygen tank. It should be placed upright in a wheeledcart, while in use. For safety reasons, this tankmust be refilled by your oxygen company when it is empty. There are two dials on each tank. One sho ws the amount of pr essurethat is left in the tank. The other window is to set the liter flow, according to your prescription. For active individuals, there are shoulder bag units on the market. This consists of a small metal tank, in alined shoulder bag. Ask your oxygen supply company if you are interested.Oxygen conserving devices ar esmall external units that fit on the outside of the metal oxygen tank. These devices deliv er oxygen only when the individual breathes in, therefore, leavingmoreoxygen in the tank to be consumed at a later moment. Individuals requiring high flow oxygen may not be good candidates for this device. A healthcare professional will need to assess your breathing to see if this device is right for you. LIQUID OXYGEN Liquid oxygen devices offer an in-home unit and aportable unit. This type of oxygen differs in the fact that one can refill their portable units athome from a larger unit, called a vessel. Thevessel does not use electricity. Liquid oxygen may last longer than conv entional o xygen gas tanks. This type of o xygen is deliv ered to the body b yaplastic hose as w ell. Liquid oxygen tanks are encased in a hard plastic shell. This system also has an o xygen conserving option, sometimes built into the device itself .Ask your doctor if a liquid o xygen system is the best for your lifestyle.Medicines YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE31Why Exercise? One of the best things you can do for yourself is to increase your level of physical activity. Regular exercise helps you feel less stressed, and improve heart function and endurance. You may have tried to exercise but had to stop due to shortness of breath. You may feel too tired to do the things you like to do. Y ou may have been ill or in the hospital and your body has gotten weak and does not function as well. You may feel like you can't exercise at all due to muscle weakness, fatigue and shortness of breath. The good news is all thesesymptoms can be improved through a regular exercise program. Exercise helps your muscles become more efficient at extracting oxygen from the blood. Themuscles then need less oxygen once they are in bettercondition. You benefit by feeling less short of breath andless tired.Benefits of Exercise Improves the performance of your lungs and heart. Allows activities of daily living to be accomplished with less shortness of breath. Helps control your weight by increasing your metabolism. Improves flexibility and range of motion. Lowers your risk of developing non-insulin dependent diabetes. Helps control blood sugar levels in individuals with diabetes. Reduces your risk of developing some cancers. Increases your HDL (good) cholesterol. Helps build and maintain healthy bones, muscles and joints. Helps prevent osteoporosis. Increases mental alertness. Helps reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. Helps you handle stress more effectively. Improves quality of sleep as well as your ability to fall asleep. Prevents or delays the development of high blood pressure. Reduces blood pressure in those who already have high blood pressure. Safe Exercise Talk with your doctor before beginning an exercise program. Exercise only if feeling well. Do not exercise through a cold, flu or fever. Avoid exercise right after a meal. Exercising too soon can cause cramps, nausea or fainting. Pace yourself and start slo w.Try one activity at a time to see ho wyour body will r espond. Drink plenty of water before, during and after exercise. Avoid caffeine and cigarettes. Do not exercise outdoors if the temperature is below 40 or above80 degr ees. Also consider humidity when exercising, as it can increase your feelings of shortness of breath. Exercise on flat ground. Listen to your body. It is okay to stop and rest. Ifyou remain fatigued for more than one hour after your exercise, you have worked too hard. Talk to your doctor if you are not feeling well. Flexibility Daily stretching to improve range of motion and flexibility is important to keep muscles and joints loose. Make sure to stretch before and after you exercise. Hold each stretch, without bouncing, for 10-30 seconds. Only str etch until there is gentle tension. Do not stretch to the point of pain. Aerobic Exercise Pick convenient exercises or equipment. Choose an exercise that you enjoy, such as walking or biking. Try different activities on different days to reduce boredom. You can exercise alone or with a group. You can exercise indoors or outdoors, depending on the weather. During high humidity or temperature extremes, try the mall, an exercise facility or your home. IEXERCISE FOR LIFE YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE Medicines32Muscle Strengthening 1. Muscle strength is important to help complete your daily activities. 2.Strengthening also helps to prevent falls and improve balance. 3. You can use free weights, elasticbands or tubes, weight training machines, orhousehold items such as a can or a bag of frozenvegetables. 4.Do resistance exercises two tothree days a week with at least one day of rest betw een. 5.Doone ex ercise for each of the major muscle gr oups. 6.Start with a light weight that y ou can lift 8-10 times. 7. Increase y our weight gradually. 8. Remember to br eathe normally during lifting. 9. Always use slow, controlled movements. 10. Donot lift thr ough pain. Rating of P erceived Exertion One way to determine how hard you are working is the Rating of Per ceived Exer tion scale. This allows you to rate how hard the exercise is. Improving Activities of Daily Living 1. Use a riding lawn mower instead of a push mower. 2. Buy electric clippers instead of hand tools.3. Sit on a stool while ironing, washing dishes or preparing meals. 4. Ask family members to help with household chores. 5. Use a long-handled brush for cleaning, to av oid bending. 6. Keep items where they can easily be reached. 7. Use a chair or stool to sit during a shower instead of standing or taking a bath. 8. Push, pull or r oll objects rather than carrying them. 9. Sit on a stool and support arms on counter top when setting hair or shaving. 10. Set the laundry basket on a chair to avoid bending. Howlong should I ex ercise? Start with a few minutes of exercise and work up to five minutes. If you areable, build up slowly, adding one to two minutes at a time. The goal is to reach 20-60 minutes of aer obic ex ercise. I f needed, y ou can br eak up y our ex ercise sessions into two to thr ee shorter sessions throughout the day to prevent fatigue.Howoften should I ex ercise? If you are just beginning an exercise program, start with three days a week,with at least one day of rest between. When you are comfortable with your exercise, incr ease to four ,and then to fivedays a w eek.Howhardshould I ex ercise? \"No pain, no gain\" is not a true statement. Exercise should bemoderate; not too hard and not too easy. It is normal to experience some shortness of br eath with ex ercise, but pursed-lip br eathing will help minimiz e this. I tis important to listen to y our body and stay within your limits. Remember to start slow and end slowwith each exercise session.

PEP therapy may also prevent or reverse atelectasis and optimize delivery of bronchodilators. The equipment is portable and PEP therapy can be performed anywhere. PEP therapy is helpful when performed for 20 minutes eachsession, and right after a bronchodilator. SMI Incentive Spirometry, also known as Sustained Maximal Inspiration (SMI), is a technique used to encourage a patient to take a maximal inspiration. It is designed to mimic natural sighing or yawning byencouraging the patient to take long, slow, deep breaths. With repetition, and as part of an overall bronchial hygiene program, SMI maneuvers may reverse lung atelectasis and restore and maintain theairway. Indications: Upper-abdominal or thoracic surgery, prolonged chr obstr uctive pulmonar ydisease, ol, or the pr esence of thoracic or abdominal binders. Flutter Valve Portable and easy to use, the flutter device effectively removes harmful secretions from the airway of patients with mucus-producing respiratory conditions. Three mechanisms of action help promote secretion removal: positive expiratory pressure, which helps holdairways which helps vibrate mucus away fr om airway walls; and intermittent flow acceleration, which helps push mucus upward for expectoration. The device is shaped like a pipe andhas a har dened plastic mouthpiece at one end, a per forated plastic cover at the other end, and a stainless steel ball r esting in a plastic circular cone on the inside. It is designed for patients with bronchitis, cystic fibr osis, atelectasis or other conditions producing retained secretions. Controlled Coughing Technique Coughing is a natural way to clean and keep your lungs healthy. Your lungs pr oduce mucus ever yday.This mucus acts as a filter to help keep your lungs free of small particles of dust, smoke, etc. that you may inhale. Contr olled coughing can help you r emove mucus om your lungs without incr easing your shor tness of br eath or incr easing your work of breathing.PANIC CONTROL Do you sometimes feel you can't get your breath? Do you huff andpuff when you climb stairs or work hard? Do you awaken at nightfeeling breathless?When you are short of breath, youmay feel nervous and try to breathefaster. More air may get trapped in your lungs, and then you feelworse. In panic situations, stopwhat you are doing and use yourpower of concentration to slow down your breathing. CONTROLLING YOUR BREATHING: (Works best for those with obstructive lung disease) Don'tgasp for air . Instead follow these steps. Relax. Let your neck and shoulders droop. Breathe in slowly. Purse your lips in a whistling position, and blow slowly and evenly.Try to take at least twice as long to blow out as you did breathing in. Relax. Repeat the pursed-lip breathing until you no longer feelbreathless. If you get dizzy, rest for a few breaths. !IDEVICES & TECHNIQUES YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE Anatomy & Physiology34TECHNIQUE 1. Sit up and lean forward.2.Take a slow deep breathe and hold for two seconds. 3. Cough two times. First cough is to loosen the mucus. Second cough is to move the mucus forward. Try not to breathe in-between coughs. Try to cough slowly and not too deep. 4. Wait one second and gently inhale again and cough. 5. Relax. 6. Repeat as needed. Wheezing Wheezing is the noise you hear when air is unable to move, due to partially blocked air tubes (bronchi). Wheezing usually occurs when you breathe out. YOU MAY WHEEZE BECAUSE: The muscles around your air tubes are irritated and they start tosqueeze, like a rubber band (asthma). You have an increased amount of mucus in you airways creating plugs (bronchitis). With emphysema, small airways (lung sacs) collapse. If your body retains fluid, causing the lining in your airways to swell. Infection or irritation. What to do when whee zing is out of contr ol: 1. Start by doing pursed lip breathing, (remember this is a relaxing exer cise). Breathe in through your nose and exhale through puckered lips. 2. Take your r escue inhaler (pr escription br onchodilator ,such as Albuter ol or Combivent). Bronchodilators help relax the muscles around your airways. 3. Drink appr opriate amounts of water. !Anatomy & better able to fight infection and prevent illnesses. Even if we do become sick, awell-nourished body responds more quickly andheals faster . Protein In Your Diet Welose cells each day fr om our skin, digestive tract and lungs that have to be replaced. Pr otein is needed for these cells to gr ow and rebuild. ISOURCES: Lean beef, pork, poultry, fish, eggs, beans, nuts, peanut butter,milk, cheese, y ogurtand tofu ar eall good sources of protein. As we get older ,our appetite often changes and foods do not taste as well, or we don't feel like preparing a meal. If adequate protein and calories arenot eaten, we lose vital muscle mass that helps us feel ener getic, pumps our blood, strengthens our immune system and helps us breath. It is important to include five to seven of these foods each day . FOODS LIKE: 1ounce beef, pork, poultry, or fish 1egg or 2 egg whites or 1/4 cup of egg substitute 1/2 cup dry cooked beans 2tablespoons peanut butter 1/3 cup nuts 1/2 cup tofu 1ounce cheese 1/4 cup cottage cheese 2T peanut butter 1/2 cup cottage cheese 3ounces beef sirloin In addition to supplying protein, lean meats and beans also supply iron and zinc. Iron is needed to transport oxygen from the lungs to all parts ofthe body. Foods high in iron are red meat, turkey breast, dried fruits, spinach and ir on for tified cer eals such as Cream of Wheat or Total. Zinc is a mineral associated with the sense of taste, smell and helps fight illness. Nuts, whole grains and cereals are also good sources of zinc. INFORMATION ON NUTRITION: EATING TO FEEL BETTER YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE NutritionNutrition YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE37Calcium In Your Diet Calcium is a mineral many people do not get enough of. It is needed for bones, teeth, nerve and muscle function and for blood to clot. These foods also supply vitamin D which is needed for the absorption of calcium. ISOURCES: Milk and yogurt are the best sources of calcium. You may have heard that dairy foods promote mucous formation which is not actually the case. After drinkingmilk, mucus may appear thicker due to a coating effect which can be reduced by drinking something warm like hot tea with lemon, something acidic such as orangejuice, or by rinsing the mouth out with water. As we get older, our digestive system tends to slow down and we may not be able to drink milk withoutexcess gas or cramping. To avoid this, try drinking smaller amounts, combining milk with a meal or snack or eating yogurt or cheese. INCLUDE TWO TO THREE SERVINGS OF THESE FOODS EACH DA Y: 1cup milk 1cup yogurt 11/2 ounce cheese 11/2 cup ice cream 1cup frozen yogurt 1cup pudding 11/2 cup turnip greens 1cup fortified orange juice 2cups cottage cheese Fiber and Vitamin B In Your Diet Many people believe br ead is fattening, but often it is the butter, mayonnaise or other toppings we add tobreads that increase the calories. Fiber is found only in plant foods and is an impor tant part of our diet to help with digestion. Whole grains, cereals and breads also contain B vitamins which help in processing the foods weeat. In addition these foods are also a good source of zinc, the healing mineral. T ry to include six to 11 servings per day depending on your calorie need. ISOURCES: Oatmeal, whole wheat bread, crackers, noodles, rice and barley are grain foods which are also good sources of fiber and B vitamins. FOR INSTANCE A MINIMUM OF SIX SERVINGS WOULD BE: 1/2 cup oatmeal for breakfast 1slice toast for breakfast1/2 cup brown rice or pasta with lunch 4whole grain crackers for snack 1tortilla or roll with evening meal Fruits and Vegetables In Your Diet Fruits and vegetables are also an important source of fiber as well as vitamins and minerals. Vitamin C andvitamin A are very important in fighting infections. Both vitamins help build strong skin and lung cells which create a healthy barrier against bacteria. Vitamin C is not stored in the body so a daily source is recommended. ISOURCES: oranges, honeydew melon, grapefruit, cantaloupe, kiwi fruit, pineapple, tomatoes, raspberries, cauliflower, tangelo, strawberries, peppers Vitamin A foods should be eaten at least every other day. ISOURCES: peaches, nectarines, apricots, prunes, sweet potatoes, tangerines, squash, mandarinoranges, carrots, tomatoes, cantaloupe, mangoes,spinach, watermelon Because of the cancer fighting properties of fruit and vegetables, a minimum of five ser vings up to nine servings are recommended each day. FOR EXAMPLE: banana on cereal for breakfast orange for morning snack peaches for lunch 1cup of cooked vegetables for evening meal (1/2 cup of cooked vegetables = 1 serving. For some people certain fruits and vegetables such as raw broccoli, cauliflower, green peppers, onions or brussel sprouts can cause gas. If a certain food causes discomfort, reduce the amount you eat. Cookingvegetables and fruits (such as stir frying apples) may helpprevent this discomfort. In addition, cutting into small pieces or choosing dried fruits can be helpful in preventing problems from gas and problems withchewing. Some dried fr uits have sulfites added to preserve freshness; so read all food labels if allergic to sulfites. Water InYour Diet It is important to maintain a high fluid intake to keep mucus thin and to help fiber foods do their job. This means drinking plenty of water, juices and lowfat milkYOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE Nutrition38and not coffee, soda pop or tea. Caffeine pulls water away from the body and can interfere with medications. Drinking carbonated beverages or using a straw may create excess air in the stomach which prevents the lungsfrom expanding properly, making it harder to breath. Drink before you feel thirsty, as thirst is not a good indicator of how much water your body needs.Lemon, lime or orange slices can be placed in ice water for added taste. Controlling Your Portions Eating too many high calorie foods and not being aware of portions can result in unwanted weight gain, making it more difficult to breath. Pay attention to servingsizes pr eviously mentioned and on food labels. Generally , higher fat foods havemore calories per volume. To avoid excess calories, reduce salad dressings, gravies, sauces, butter,margarine, fried foods, cheese, ice cream, sourcream, cream cheese,nuts and peanut butter .Flavor foods with spices, herbs, vinegar and lemon or lime juice rather than bacon grease and butter. On the other hand, to increase weight, include these dense calorie foods. Snack on peanut butter, cheeses,unsalted nuts and sunflower seeds. Add extra margarine to your vegetables, add peanut butter to an apple, snack on cheese and crackers or sunflower seeds mixed withraisins or other dried fruits, or fry fish or potatoes in canola oil. All of these will add calories. Patients with severe lung disease may find it helpful to eat more frequent, smaller meals throughout the day. Anaverage of five to six meals can decrease the sense of shortness of breath. Sodium In Your Diet Sodium is needed by the body but most Americans get more sodium than is needed. Excess sodium causes our bodies to retain fluids, much like a sponge. This makes it harder for our heart and lungs to pump oxygen to all ourbody parts. A maximum of 2400 milligrams (2.4 grams) of sodium is recommended per day. If you are eating out often, having canned soups, canned vegetables, pickles,ham, bologna, cottage cheese and deli meats you may betaking in too much sodium. Limit these foods and instead of adding salt for cooking and seasoning, use garlic powder, onion powder, lemon or lime juice andvinegar for seasoning. Read food labels for sodium content, trying to choose foods with less than 140 mg per ser ving. For example: A ser ving of Triscuit crackers contain 180 mg of sodium while a serving of Low Sodium Triscuit crackers contain 75 mg of sodium. Drink before you feel thirsty, as thirst is not a good indicator of ho wmuch water your body needs. You should be drinking six to eight glasses a day .

Take advantage of these times to do the most meal preparation such as washingand slicing fresh vegetables to keep handy in therefrigerator or to add to soups, stirring puddings on the sto ve top, or cooking larger quantities and freezing for later use. Also, take advantage ofcooking equipment such as a microwave, crockpot,grill or oven to bake a complete meal. When serving or eating y our meals, make the atmosphere as relaxed as possible. Allow a fewminutes to rest just before sitting down to eat,turn of fthe television and set the table out of viewof the dirty pots and pans.

Denial is a common first reaction to fears of becoming dependent or inactive. Other emotions follow. Anger Sometimes God is the first one to get the blame. We may get angry with an individual who had some part inwhat happened. Sometimes people around us, our family, or co-workers may feel the brunt of our anger even though we are not angry with them. Sometimes we mayeven become angry with ourselves because we, ourselves played some part in our illness. Anxiety & Guilt Unfortunately, things that happen to us may be the result of our individual behavior. Over-eating results in obesity. Abusing alcohol can result in liver problems. Smoking leads to pulmonary problems. When our own behavior results in physical problems, we can be plagued by guilt, remorse and grief. Then anxiety can kick in. It may feel like you no longer have any control over your life. Feelings of helplessness can cause anxiety to hover over us like a black cloud.Shor t-termanxiety can be a motivator that gets us going on the road to a better quality of life. But if we allow our anxiety to r emain unchecked, it can lead to fur ther health complications like depression. Depression Depression is often a natural by-product of illness. With on-going problems, such as pulmonary illness, the reality of life long pr oblems can be over whelming. When we ar efirst confr onted with life-changing situations, we often feel helpless. When we feel powerless, that can often make our hope disappear. That is when depression will often loom over us like a fire-breathing dragon. Itmay seem like we ar ecaught in a pit of despair. Sohowdo wefind an escape? Where can we find relief? Coping With Changes When we experience unwelcome changes, our focus becomes very inward. We focus on our problems and we look for quick solutions. If quick solutions are not athand, our anxiety level goes up and we began to miss the opportunities for help that are right at hand because we cannot see them. The beginning of regaining a better quality of life is to \"admit\" the truth of what is going on in your life.Pulmonary problems are now a part of your life. They won't magically disappear. You cannot make progress until you accept that fact. It doesn't mean you have to like it. It means that you accept the reality of yoursituation. When you do, it will begin to empower you to work on changes that will improve the quality of your life. Changing Focus Admitting or accepting the truth about your pulmonary disease is the beginning of a new direction for your life.It opens your eyes to the many possibilities for help as you deal with your pulmonary illness. A wide range of emotions are normal after a health crisis. The negative will abate andpositive feelings will emerge as you heal. As you find a better quality of life in dealing with your pulmonary illness, remember your \"recovery team.\" They will assist you as yourebuild Body, Mind and Spirit.YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE Spiritual & Emotional Adjustments42It will also allow a change of focus to begin as you become actively involved in dealing with your pulmonary problems. Rather than a totally inward focus, you will begin to see that you are not isolated by your pulmonary problems. You are not alone. There are resources nearby. Finding Resources The first resource at your disposal is \"people going through the same thing\" you are experiencing. We can always benefit by talking with people who are coping with problems like ours. Every time you go to rehab, you meet people who are dealing with similar circumstances. A second resource is the array of \"professionals\" at your disposal. In our health system, we are fortunate to have a large group of highly skilled physicians, nurses, therapists and rehab specialists who will assist you in your physical and emotional health journey. Never hesitate to let someone know of your needs and how we canassist you at any point in your health care journey. Even when it's past normal office hours, you may call the professionals (417-888-8888)at any time if you are having a problem or have an important question. A third resource is those who can provide \"spiritual care\" to you in your health journey. St. John'sis staffed by a large group of chaplains who are full-time employees of the hospital. Chaplains are present in the hospital 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Chaplains are not just for inpatients. They are always prepared and are willing to sit down with you when you need to talk about the challenges you are facing. To contact achaplain you may call 417-820-2735 24 hours a day. There are other resources around you too. If you have a church family, be sure to let them know you have physical needs. Not only will they actively pray for youbut they are a resource for other avenues of help. People in your church and yourneighborhood will often reach out during your time of need. Pulmonary Disease Reaches Beyond You as Patient When physical changes come along, they not only affect you as the patient. They also affect every member of your immediate family. You are important toyour family .You have a special r ole that you fill in your family. Because of your disease, you may not be able to fulfill your normal role. You may have been theone to mow the lawn, carry out the trash, run the vacuum, or care for the garden.Another family member may have to assume that duty .When we can no longer follow your normal routine, it may worry you. Your anxiety affects you and it affects your family members who want to help you have a better quality of life. Help For the Family It is important for your family and close friends to fully understand the nature of your pulmonary problems. It is also important for them to know how you are feeling as you cope with your health challenges. They want to help you, but sometimes family members and friends don' tknow what to do if they don' tknow how you feel or what you are thinking. Communication is the \"key\" to helping them understand your situation. Understanding goes a long way in relieving fears. Allow them to ask questions ofyou and your medical team. Be sensitive to their fears and anxiety about your health by including them in what is taking place. KNOW YOUR RESOURCES Look around you. You are NOT Alone! 1.

A combination ofanxiety ,fatigue, depr ession, medication and sometimes warnings from your doctor may have reduced your interest in sex for a while. As you begin to feel better,your interest will likely return. Having sex with a comfortable familiar partner makes the heart and lungs work about as har das climbing two flights of stairs or walking briskly for two or three blocks. Your heart muscle needs increased amounts of oxygen whenyour heart rate increases due to any type of exercise, including sex. Yourrespirator yor breathing rate will be faster as it tries to meet the increased oxygen needs of the body during sexual activity. Talk with your doctor and pulmonary rehab staff about your body's ability to deliver oxygen during exer cise. When your doctor is confident of your ability to walk or exer cise at an appr opriate level, your lungs ar eready for sex. What P osition I sBest? Lying side by side or sitting upright maybe be more comfortable. A seated position may be more comfortable than lying down. You may need to try new positions to avoid symptoms, but remember that satisfaction depends on both you and your partner being comfortable. Ifchanging positions makes either of you anxious, return to a more familiarposition. What if You Have Symptoms During Sex? Some people may experience symptoms of overexertion during sex, including angina, palpitations, irregular heartbeat, or excessive shortness ofbreath. If this happens to you, stop and r est for a few minutes. If your doctor prescribed oxygen or inhalers, use them. When the symptoms go away you may resume sexual activity. If rest or medication does not relieve thesymptoms or if symptoms r eturnwhen you resume sex, call your doctor.Intimacy YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE45Your doctor may be able to suggest changes in your day-to-day routines, or medication that will ease your symptoms. YOU SHOULD NOTIFY YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU HAVE ANY OF THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS DURING SEXUAL ACTIVITY: steady chest pain or discomfort. shortness of breath. raised heart rate for more than 15 minutes after intercourse. sleeplessness or extreme fatigue afterward. Remember, it is normal for your heart to beat faster and your breathing to speed up during sex. Your heartbeat and breathing should slow down and return to normal shortly afterward. What about Sexual Problems? Pulmonary disease affects the entire body. Some medications have a side effect ofimpotence. If you are a man and have trouble getting an erection, please discuss it with your doctor. If you are taking any type of nitroglycerin, you should not take Viagra, Cialis or Levitra. Sometimes physical or emotional discomfort can interfere with your ability to enjoy sex. Men may feel less sexual desir e, may be unable to get or maintain an erection, or may experience delayed ejaculation. Women may feel less sexualdesir e,may notice a decr ease in vaginal lubrication or be unable to r each or gasm.TIPS FOR ENJOYING SEX AGAIN Talk about when to resume sexual activity and decide together. Show your affection for each other daily in non-sexual ways, such as holdinghands, talking, sharing feelings, hugging and touching. Relax and get in touch with your partner before sex. Trade massages, listen to music or cuddle. Take a nap first if you are tired. Wait one to three hours after eating a meal. Make the room temperature comfortable. Select a position that is comfortable and familiar. Breathe deeply from your diaphragm. Try pursed-lip breathing to help youprevent breathlessness during intercourse. Plan sexual activity an hour after taking lung clearing treatments. Take your time and enjoy each other. Simply taking private time and holding each other can strengthen your relationship with less physical exertion than sex. If anxiety or problems in your relationship are interfering with yourenjoyment of sex, talk to your partner. An honest, loving discussion may clear up fears,misunderstandings and problems that are worrying both or you. Don't ignore the problem. Instead, ask your doctor what might be causingthe problem. S ometimes, switching medications is all that is needed. If you or your partner are nervous about r esuming sex, start b ysharing intimate time without intercourse. Talk about your hopes and fears andreassure each other of your love. If you are uncomfortable talking, your doctor may suggest a counselor orrelaxation expert who can help y ou learn together.Working through your emotions will help you move forward. Coming toterms with y our feelings can actually improve your life and strengthen your relationships. Follow the common senseguidelines giv en her e, and you and your partner can once again share this valuable human communication. Ask your pulmonary rehabilitation educator if you would like moreinformation about sexuality and lungdisease.WHAT CAN YOU DO?INFORMATION ON LIVING WITH LUNG DISEASE YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE Living with Lung Disease46When you have a lung condition, it is important to learn how to avoid fatigue. You want to find ways to do your work, and find a good balance between workand rest. Finding ways to conserve your energy will help you cope with your lung condition. Hereare some tips to help you conserve energy: IPACING Pace yourself and don't rush. If you feel breathless, use pursed-lip breathing. Determine your \"best breathing\" time of day for activities. Do difficult tasksduring this time. If mor nings ar ehard, shower in the evening. Prepare for breakfast befor ebed. Avoid bending and lifting. If possible, use a cart for carrying several items so only one trip is needed. Don't take on more than you can handle comfortably and when you feel tired, QUIT. IWAKING UP Soft music is much more pleasant than an alarm if you are easily startled. When making the bed, make one side, sit and rest as needed, then move to the other side. Before getting all the way out of bed, do some of your dressing sitting on theedge of your bed. Every night leave your robe and slippers or shoes, socksand under wear wher ethey ar eeasy to r each in the mor ning. Ifyou share quarters with another person, persuade him/her to let you have the bureau drawers which are easiest to reach.Living with Lung Disease YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE47IBATHING If a shower or tub bath is too demanding, a great solution is to get a bath stool. Use a hand-sprayerwhich may be attached to the tub faucet or showerhead. If excess humidity bothers you, leave the bathroomdoor open and turn on the exhaust fan. Ifyou feel weak, don't take a bath or shower when you are alone. Shaving or applying make-up is much easier if you have a low mirror so that you can sit down while doingeither. Incidentally, it is OK to remove the nasal cannulabriefly to wash your face, shave or apply makeup. IGROOMING Avoid toiletries with heavy perfumes. Useof sprays and aer osols, except those pr escribed by adoctor, is a bad idea. There are many liquid or gel type hair dressings. Also unscented roll-on or soliddeodorants are excellent. IDRESSING Don'twear clothing which restricts chest and abdominal expansion. This can include: belts, gir dles, tight bras. Slip-on type shoes means no bending over to tieshoelaces. Avoid tight neck bands. Alarge shawl is great for occasional shivers. It is much easier to put on and off than a sweater. IMEDICATIONS Apillbox with a separate compar tment for each day of the week is helpful. Whenever you get a new medicine or a refill from thedrugstor e, figur eout how long it will last and mark on acalendar the time to reorder. Never use anyone else' smedicine! T wo people may have the same disease and the same symptoms and yet respond to the same medication in entirelydifferent ways. Keep pills away from heat and moisture. IRESPIRATORY THERAPY If you take br eathing tr eatments at home, try to get all of your equipment together in a convenient place where it can be left from treatment to treatment. All equipment should be kept clean and should be sterilized as directed. If you find the plastic hose difficult to pull loose, trying pulling it off while the machine is running. Some of these machines have a small air filter whichshould be changed. Ask your supplier to give yousome. Most medical equipment used at home can bepurchased. Ask your supplier to compare rental versuspurchase prices. IOXYGEN Oxygen is a prescribed drug. Questions aboutamount and usage arefor your physician toanswer. Find out approximately how long eachportable unit supplywill last youspecifically .Learnto time your outings so you don't run short. Change nasal cannulasfairly often particularlyif the pr ongs become soiled oruncomfortable. ILIFTING AND TOTING Get yourself a small utility cart, the kind with shelves. Carrying things downstairs is not a problem for most of us. Carrying them up may be a different story. There is one way: On an exhale, lift your bur den two or thr ee steps and put it down, rest. Climb two or three steps, rest again. Repeat. This may be a little slow, howeverit is possible to do the job without knocking yourselfout. If you live where you must climb stairs, you mightconsider a mechanical chair lift, but they ar every expensive. In any case, it is a good idea to have a chair to sit on or a table to lean on when you reach the top. ISOME CLEANING TOOLS One of the handiest gadgets is a pair of pickup tongs (these look like giant scissors). These can be used toretrieve things from hard-to-reach places. Mostmedical supply houses stock these. YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE Living with Lung Disease48If you find you must do a dusty job, the best idea is to use a mask. If you must use a vacuum, which is not such a greatidea, at least use a machine with a disposable bag andremove with extreme care. A small hand vacuum is easy to use for spot cleanups and can stay on yourcart. Avoid using anything harmful that can vaporize, suchaskerosene, mothballs and solvents. Avoid using powders and aerosols. Have good ventilation and an adequate supply of freshair at all times. IIN THE KITCHEN Plan your meals when you are neither hungry or tired. Light, well-balanced meals are too important to leave to impulse. Small, frequent meals are better than a few large ones. The more room the stomach takes up, the less roomfor air in the lungs. Prolonged digestion draws blood and oxygen to the stomach and away from other partsof the body which may need them more. Utilize convenience foods when desired, but rememberthat many packaged foods have high salt and sugarcontents which may be banned if you are a specialdiet. Learn to read the food labels. If you enjoy cooking, it is often as easy to make a double or triple amount of your specialties. Fr eeze the excess in meal-size containers and enjoy some cook-free meals when you feel like a day off. Amicrowave oven can reduce cooking time and temperatur es. A slow-cooking crockpot may make things easier ,too. When cooking, always use your exhaust fan, or make sure there is good ventilation. If you are bothered by heat, try using a small portable fan when cooking or ir oning. In fact, a small portable fan is useful in any room, not only to cool you off butalso to help over come shor tness of br eath br ought on by exertion or stress. It is also useful for blowing all sorts of offensive or irritating odors away from you,should the need arise. IGOING OUT Be aware of air pollution. If you can get a daily air quality r eport in your area, use it when making plans for your day . Before leaving home, lay out your comfortable clothes and slippers, tur ndown your bed for a quick nap- whatever makes you feel good. Homecoming can then be more than just a relief, it can be a realpleasur e. TIPS FOR REST AND RECREA TION: Make friends with whom y ou can share common interests and pr oblems with. M any of the people y ou meet at pulmonary r ehab have much in common. The buddy phone system can be a big help and provide a special feeling of security. If you live in an apartment, let the neighbors on all sides of you know that if they hear you pounding youneed help. There are many entertaining things to do at homebesides watching TV.Hereareafew: Board games, cardgames, chess, jigsaw puzzles, r eading, home- study courses, a fish, needle work, painting, playing the piano, mail order shopping. Keep all useful phone numbers next to y our bed. Some sort of night light is a necessity .Itlessens the possibility of y ou being disoriented if y ou waken suddenly and helps you locate things you may need in ahurry.Living with Lung Disease YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE49In cold weather, wear a nice long, warm scarf. If it gets too cold or windy, do not hesitate to wrap it across your nose. Some people prefer a cold-weather mask instead. IRIDING AND DRIVING If you have trouble getting from spot A to spot B, it matters not whether the problem arises in your legs or lungs, you do have trouble walking and are entitled to a \"handicapped\" parking permit. It is simple to obtain in most places. Write toyour State Motor Vehicle Department for an application. Take the application to your doctor to sign. Make sure you display your permit. Acoffee can with a snap-on plastic lid makes a dandy emergency urinal. If you do drive and find that you must put gas in the car yourself, try to get upwind from the pump so that you do not gasyourself as well as the car. Have a cell-phone available or CB radio in the car. ISHOPPING If you are shopping with an oxygen carrier, try to find a shopping cart to put your oxygen pack into while you shop. Try to pick an off day and hour to shop (not weekends). This way you can move at a leisurely pace and avoid being jostled. It is helpful to stay out of all sorts of crowds, particularly indoors. Aside from the fact that the air may be smoky andunpleasant, you run a high risk of having someone sneeze or cough in your face. Don't be afraid to ask someone to stop smoking near you. We all have a right to breathe smoke-free air. Shopping for clothing can be exhausting. Know your measur ements (write them down) and car ry a small rolled up tape measure with you. Make sure that if an item isn't satisfactory, it can be returned. When you have a fairly large grocery order, have all the \"spoilables\", such as frozen foods, packed in a separate bag. Whenyou get home, you can put away whatever needs refrigeration. Leave the rest for later when you feel more energetic or a\"helper\" can lend a hand. Incidentally, it won't hurt to wash your hands extra well when you get home.

Harmful E ffects from Smoking Lungs: Two of the major health consequences of smoking are COPD and cancer. COPD destroys the lung's ability to expand and contract. Normal alveoli expands and contracts similar to a latex balloon. However, with COPD some ofthe alv eoli (tiny air sacs wher eoxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged) have changed shape. They expand like a paper bag with no ability to contract. Thisleaves trapped air in the lungs and the smoker will experience difficultybreathing. Once this develops, it can't be fixed. Every breath is a struggle.Lack of oxygen damages other organs and makes even the smallest task difficult. Many times death from COPD occurs because the heart is overworkedBecoming a Nonsmoker YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE51FIVE REASONS PEOPLE SMOKE & HOW TO RESIST THEM Stimulation Do this instead: Take a brief walk, ride a bike, keep busy, avoid fatigue, get plenty of sleep.

The lining of the lungs is covered with cilia, which continuously beat producing a net flow of material up and out to the throat. It is the cilia movement that ultimately clears foreign particles out of the lungs. Smoking effects the rate at which the lungs' cilia beat.Smokers' cilia beat SLOWER than normal, and continue to slow down the longer the person smokes. Quitting smoking RE VERSES this ef fect and the cilia gradually r ecover their beating rates o ver time. Cigar ette smoking is a major risk factor for heart attack, str oke and peripheral v ascular disease. CANCER: Smoking damages the genetic code of normal cells and decreases the body 'snatural pr otection against cancer .These damaged cells can become tumors which steal nutrition and ener gy from the rest of the body. Besides lung cancer, smoking is linked with cancers of the mouth, throat, pancreas, cervix, kidney ,and bladder .

Secondhand Smoke The major consideration for secondhand smoke is the same as for firsthand smoke: EXPOSURE. Chronic exposure: Living with someone who smokes a pack or more a day can have specific and serious effects. Chronic exposure tosecondhand smoke has shown several cases of non-smoking relatives of smokers getting COPD,usually chronic bronchitis, which was partially reversed by ending exposure. About Gaining Wight While it is true that a weight gain of up to 20 pounds can be a side ef fect of quitting smoking, for most people this increase is temporary.

Feel better about yourself - YOU QUIT SMOKING! Your Body's Response to Smoking Within seconds, cigar ette smoke is inhaled into the lungs allowing nicotine and other chemicals to absorb into the bloodstr eam, and travel to all areas of the body. Within 10 seconds, nicotine r eaches the brain and af fects the brain chemicals which control mood swings, r elaxation, and ar ousal. As a r esult, you may feel an incr ease in pleasur e, better able to concentrate, increased memory, mood control, anxiety reduction and appetite suppr ession. After a period of time, the nicotine level starts to drop. The decrease triggers withdrawal symptoms and the tobacco user begins to self-medicate with nicotine to avoid the withdrawal symptoms, therefore causing a vicious cycle of addiction. It takes 72 hours for nicotine to leave your system. During this time, you will notice an increase in withdrawal symptoms.Take a walk Eat somethinghealthful Make a phone call Write a letter Take a shower orbath Spend five minutesbrushing and flossingyour teeth after youeat Help someone elsequit Spruce up yourappearance Read a bookBurn incense Go swimming Light a fragrantcandle Suck on a mint Chew on a straw Play with clay or sillyputty Drink 12 oz. water Suck on a toothpick Chew sugarless gum Visit a nonsmokerfriend Breathe deeply Squeeze a foam ball7 Appendix YOUR LUNGS YOUR LIFE53Support Groups,Classes &Resources Askfor Help When You Need It St. John's Health System offers many programs to help you live ahealthy life-style.
