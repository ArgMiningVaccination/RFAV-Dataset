At present there is a fierce race amongst all the countries for the search of vaccine/remedial measures for COVID-19, but so far the success seems to be far off, and in fact it is not clear that even after vaccines/therapeutic medicines are made available in sufficient quantities whether COVID-19 in its new form will not keep on returning? WHO has already indicated that, 'Corona virus' is going to stay and we will have to live with it, accept it and adapt our life-styles to its existence. What the Science has learnt and is learning about Corona viruses. Corona virus is a generic name for a virus that originates in an animal and gets transmitted to human beings. Dr. Sasi Kumar Menon, Associate Professor at Ruia College, Mumbai in his presentation entitled, 'COVID-19: What has Science Learnt and is still Learning', finds some similarities between SARS-CoV and COVID-19 and maintains that although Horseshoe bats are natural reservoirs of Corona viruses, there are different intermediary hosts through which they are transmitted to human beings. The slides of WHO Table and Intermediary Hosts from his presentation are given here. Although in case of COVID-19 the fatality percentage is less as compared to earlier Corona viruses, it is more fearsome; more contagious and fast spreading. Dr. Menon attributes reasons for origin of SARS-CoV and COVID-19 to China to its lucrative Wild Animal Market. There are Wild Animal Breeding Farms and caged animals in market place that have close proximity with each other including human beings and thus Corona viruses are easily passed on to human beings. Dr. Menon makes an interesting question as to \"Whom we should blame for CoVs, BATs or HUMAN Lifestyles?\" This is an irony that despite spending billions of dollars in R&D the Pharma Industry and Medical Profession have not come out with vaccines or effective medical treatments for Corona virus infections which have flu-like symptoms. Anthroposophical View The Anthroposophical view of COVID-19 supports the view of animal torture as the cause of the spread of this virulent and intelligent virus differently. Shri Josef Graf in his [article](https://www.rsarchive.org/RelArtic/GrafJ/coronavirus.html), 'Corona virus - Meeting COVID-19 head on with Anthroposophy'. According to him, the origin of COVID-19 is likely due to the debasing of the general Astral Field of the area (and many of the inhabitants themselves) due to the suffering of animals. Massive Factory Farming in China has been degrading the quality of life for animals for a while now. - Both the Wuhan lab-work and the local animal meat market contained suffering animals and /or animal meat products. - Animal suffering lives in 'mass meat and eggs', etc. and is transferred into human Astral Bodies\" In another theory, he revealed that \"whenever we have these modern pandemics, they have tended to originate wherever high-tech radiation has been a factor. In this case the first roll out of 5G-Technology is said to have taken place in Wuhan province. The Anthroposophic view is, The Corona pandemic affects humans, and evidently no animals are falling ill (although there may be some exceptions). It thus clearly indicates that it is related to the 'I' being. Prevention and cure must therefore also include the spiritual dimension alongside many other things.' Nature's Balancing Theory / Absolute's Correction Theory There is another theory for the emergence and existence of COVID-19, and that is the 'Nature's Balancing Theory' or 'Absolute's Correction Theory'. Dr. Chand Bhardwaj (the Originator and Author of 'Co-AIM Theory and Practice', which very briefly means Co-relation theory of Attention, Information and Material) puts this theory as, 'Jaisi Karani Vaisi Bharani'. Universal Cosmic Order is an intelligent and conscious design, where everything works in a set order. All Cosmic Creation is divine and all beings including animals and humans are three-in-one: Soul = Attention - Outer expression of Creative Intelligence-connected to its origin Absolute; Mind = Information of time (past and future events and experiences) -connected to Universal Mind; Body = Material (elements) - Material body made out of the floating material like our earth and planets (Panchtatva). The Absolute Creative Intelligence through its Universal Mind carries on the functions of regulation of the Universal Cosmic Order. The correction takes place as per Newton's third law i.e. 'Every action has an equal and opposite reaction'. The Absolute Intelligence and a capable force operate the Universal Mind to enforce the laws of Nature. The animal sufferings through their bodies and mind communicated to the Absolute as a Single Sensor of all senses, as well as Planet Earth's devastations due to man-made pollution, witnessed by the omniscient Absolute/ Universal Mind; might have set in the correction process to teach a few lessons to the human species. Human beings are threatened by COVID-19 but all other beings and Nature are welcoming this change. Ecological balance and Atmospheric Order are getting set properly. Articles published on Vedic WAVES blog on this subject highlighting harmony with nature. Also, quoting few lines of Vi Vienne in Spain - \"The Earth whispered but you did not hear. The earth spoke but you did not listen. The Earth screamed but you turned her off.......And so I was born. I was not born to punish you. I was born to awaken you......The Earth cried out for help....massive flooding. But you did not listen.....Start caring about the Earth and all its creatures. Start believing in (your) Creator....Signed Corona Virus\" Vedic View The wisdom of Vedas provides principles, values and guidelines for dealing with problems in life. Dis-harmonized life-styles in conflict with the nature and large scale man-made pollution are the main causes of human suffering and ill-health. Param Sadguru Shri Gajanan Maharaj said that so Agni Upsana (Yaj\u00f1a) was in vogue Bhrat Varsha was a rich and glorious country, but with its loss, the spread of slavery, poverty, diseases and epidemics have become rampant and beyond the control of man ( , , ). COVID-19 pandemic has made world re-examine interconnection between man and nature. 'Yaj\u00f1a' and 'Yoga' are the two basic concepts of Vedas and Vedic Sciences. Sarvam Yaj\u00f1ayamayam Jagat The whole universe is the process of Yaj\u00f1a The twin objectives of Yaj\u00f1a are: Vyashti Kalyan and Samashti Kalyan. Vedic more to offer for Samashti Kalyan and countering pandemics like COVID-19, but that would need another article to follow. - [Sh.
