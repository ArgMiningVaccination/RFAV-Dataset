Nearly two years ago, collaborating with the legislature , we embarked on a multiyear plan to prepare for the weathering of an unknown storm by limiting growth and preserving cash. The result of those decisive actions have proven wise and we are now comfortable proposing strategic investments that continue our return to pre -pandemic priorities, investing in what works and focusing on outcomes for Tennesseans . We are proceeding with a delicate balance of strengthening our fiscal position while also preparing our state for the oppo rtunities we see on the horizon . The proposed fiscal year 2023 budget is $52.5 billion, of which $26.4 billion is state approp riations , $19.8 billion is federal funding , and $6.4 billion is from other sources. It is again important to note the significant increase in federal funding that Tennessee received in fiscal year 2022 as a result of the federal response to the pandemic. I am proud of the bipartisan and bicameral Financial Stimulus Accountability Group that has provided critical oversight and counsel of allocation of these federal funds. This budget is balanced, assumes conservative yet practical growth rates, and reserves funding for contingency planning. It places the state in the best position to continue shepherding an economic recovery while also preparing for potential uncertainty. The development of this budget was informed by expert opinions of economists from across our state, all of whom counseled continued caution. We are deliberately ensuring that more than $1.3 billion of recurring revenue is allocated to one-time expenditures , allowing the return of these resources for review and budgeting next fiscal year . Such practice affords us the ability to better manage revenue fluctuations while maintaining our commitment to investments of critical importance. The collaborative and judicious approach to managing state assets between your administration and the legislature has resulted in Tennessee's solid financial position during an extraordinarily uncertain and challenging period. I am grateful for the opportunity to work with you and the legislature on this budget and other critical matters in the coming months.

Sincerely, Butch Eley, Commissioner Department of Finance and Administration State of Tennessee Budget Highlights Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 2022- 2023 The fiscal year 2022-2023 budget consists of strong revenues from an economy favorable to families and businesses in Tennessee and strategic investments that focus resources on new efforts to improve the lives of Tennesseans. The total recommended state b udget for fiscal year 2022-2023 is $52.5 billion, with $ 26.4 billion from state appropriati ons; $19.8 billion from federal funds ; $4.4 billion from other departmental revenues ; $2.0 billio n from higher education student tuition and fees ; and $83.5 million in bonds. This is a n increase of $1.3 billion in total funding and a n increase of $ 4.4 billion in state funding from the revised current fiscal year 2021-2022 spending estimates . Federal revenue is decreasing by $3 billion, departmental revenue is decreasi ng by $90 million, capital and highway construction bonds decrease by $42.5 million , and higher education s tudent tuition and fees remain the same. Midyear review of state tax collections an d advice from economists and the State Funding Board suggest t hat current -year estimates of taxes collected by the Department of Revenue show strong growth. The revis ed recurring current -year growth rate in the general fund is 8.5 percent compared with the actual 2020-2021 Department of Revenue collections. For fis cal year 2022- 2023, before inter -fund reallocations, recurring general fund taxes are expected to grow by $371.5 m illion above the revised current -year estimate.

Called \"Funding for Student S uccess, \" the legislation will incentivi ze strat egic and effi cient spending to acce lerate stu dent achievement. To fund the legislation, a recurring $750,000,000 is recommended. Due to delayed implementa tion of the new formula until fiscal year 2 023-2024, the $750,000,000 can be utiliz ed for no n-recurring uses in fiscal year 2022-2023. Thus, $500,000,000 is recom mended to provide innovat ive career and technical educat ion gra nts to all high and middle schools in the state. A further $200,000,000 is proposed to re l ocate 14 schools currently in flood plains.

Detailed Budget Estimates - Estimates of expenditures an d revenues, including all funding sources; program statements; statement of the state's bonded indebtedness, detailing redemption requirements until retirement, the net and gross debt of the state, and condition of the sinking fund; and 3. Appropriations Bill and Other Budget Bills - The General Appropriations Bill, through which the General Assembly gives legal sanction to the financial plan it adopts. Upon passage, this bill appropriates by agency and fund s the expenditures for the ensuing fiscal year. The revenues by which these expenditures are financed also are d etailed in this bill. In addition, other bills required to give legal sanction to the financial plan must be filed. Parts one and two are included in the Budget D ocument.

The $19,769,473 ,900 of federal funding is a de crease of 13.0 percent from the 20 21-2022 estimate. Of the total federal funding, $8,677,668 ,600 (43.9 percent ) is recommended for TennCare expenditures, $4,196,773,900 (21.2 percent ) for the Department of Human Services, $ 1,821 ,693,600 (9.2 percent ) for the Department of Education, and $5,073,337,800 (25.7 percent ) for all other state programs. The Division of TennCare receives funds from the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the state's Medicaid waiver program. The Tennessee Department of Human Services administers multiple federal programs, with the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (formerly known as Food Stamps) being the largest. The Tennessee Department of Education also administers multiple large federal programs, receiving funds from the federal Department of Education, for such programs as grants to Local Education Agencies, Special Education, and School Nutrition programs. Actual Actual Actual Actual Estimated Recommended 2017-2018 2018-2019 Change FY 2022 to 2023 FY 2018 to 2023 Total s 2017-2018 to 2020-2021, non- TennCare federal fund collections were between $5.6 and $ 9.8 billion , with estimated funding in fiscal years 20 21-2022 and 2022-2023 above fiscal year 2020-2021 actual levels . In the TennCare program, an upward trend in federal funding from fiscal years 2017-2018 to 2020 -2021 flattens in fiscal years 20 21-2022 and 2022-2023. The trend s in fiscal years 2021- 2022 and 2022-2023 are largely due to medical inflation and utilization in the program, continued implementation of information systems , and i ncreased utilization of a waiver for intellectually and developmentally disabled enrollees being tempered by expiring pandemic- related federal assistance . The impacts to the TennCare budget are displayed elsewhere in this budget. Pandemic -related Federal Spending Bills In March 2020, Congress began passing a series of a cts in response to the unfolding public health and economic crisis. The six acts passed were: H .R. 6074 Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act (CPRSA Act); H .R. 6201 Families (FFCR Act); H.R. 748 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic S ecurity Act (CARES Act); H .R. 266 Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (PPPHCE Act); H .R. 133 Consolidated Appropriations Act; and H .R. 1319 American Rescue Plan (ARP). Key provisions of the laws included direct, one -time payments to individuals and families, increased unemployment benefits, loans to businesses, and direct aid to state and local governments. A chart of estimated allocations to the State of Tennessee from these six acts is found elsewhere in this budget. Within the CARES Act, funding was also provided to establish the Coronavirus Relief Fund. This fund provided a block grant to states for the purpose of addressing costs specific to each state in its response to the COVID- 19 outbreak. The act allowed each state a ce rtain degree of flexibility in determining how those funds could be directed. A chart of allocations from this fund is found elsewhere in this budget. Within the ARP Act, funding was also provided to establish the Fiscal Recovery Fund. This fund provide s a block grant to states to continue COVID -19 response, invest in initiatives that support economic recovery, and strengthen fiscal stability. To allocate this fund, the executive and legislative branches formed a Financial Stimulus Accountability Group (FSAG) to review and recommend proposals for funding. FSAG's work on allocating this fund is ongoing. A chart of allocations from this fund is found elsewhere in this budget. Fiscal Year 2023 Outlook For fiscal year 2022-2023, total federal aid decreases from the fiscal year 202 1-2022 estimate. This is largely due to the time -limited nature of the funds from the six above- referenced acts. The continuation of the programs in the six above- referenced acts will span multiple future fiscal years . Those funds will be allocated accordingly by recommendation of the executive branch and enactment by the legislative branch.

The Boyd Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Tennessee prepared this summary of current economic conditions and expectations for short -term economic growth in Tennessee and the nation. For additional information, see the most recent edition of \"An Economic Report to the Governor of the State of Tennessee .\" In comparison to 2020, which was heavily defined by the pandemic, 2021 will largely be viewed as a year of recovery, from an economic standpoint. In the first half of 2021, consumer spending surged, as effective vaccines facilitated the return to in -person services for many, and a third round of fiscal stimulus coupled with pent -up demand led to a large boost in consumer purchases. As a result, Tennessee inflation -adjust ed gross domestic product (real GDP) has already recovered to pre -pandemic levels, and will grow by a remarkable 5.6 percent for the 2021 year as a whole. The U.S. economy will grow by a comparable 5.5 percent in 2021. The labor market, at both the state and national level, have been slower to recover. Nationwide, there are still 3.9 million fewer workers on payrolls than there were prior to the pandemic, and roughly 45,000 fewer workers in Tennessee (as of November 2021). Nonetheless, Tennessee employmen t is projected to continue showing positive growth and will slowly recover to pre -pandemic levels in the near term . Recent Economic Conditions U.S. real GDP is expected to grow by a robust 5.5 percent in 2021. Strong growth was largely concentrated in the first half of the year, as GDP expanded by 6.3 percent and 6.7 percent in the first and second quarter respectively. Economic growth slowed to 2.1 percent in the third quarter as the emergence of the COVID -19 delta variant, supply chain issues, and higher prices, tempered economic activity to some degree. Nonetheless, the U.S. economy will see strong growth for the year as a whole. Total consumption spending will expand by 8.0 percent in 2021, the highest increase in over a decade. Spending on services will grow by 5.8 percent as compared to their 2020- lows, while spending on goods continue to show strength. Purchases of durable goods will increas e by a remarkable 17.7 percent, and consumer spending on nondurable goods will advance by 9.3 percent. Following the 5.7 percent reduction in nonfarm employment in 2020, U.S. payrolls will grow by a robust 2.7 percent in 2021, but will still end the year with roughly 3.1 million fewer workers on payrolls than there were prior to the pandemic. As a result, the national unemployment rate will fall from an annual average of 8.1 percent in 2020 to 5.4 percent in 2021. The housing market continues to show strength and as a result, residential fixed investment will grow by 8.5 percent for the year. However, a persistent shortage of available houses has led to increased home prices. The median price for a house sold in the United States increased by over 15 per cent in the year, from under $300,000 in 2020 to $345,000 in 2021. A similar increase occurred for newly constructed houses. Higher prices were certainly not limited to the housing market. The inflation rate, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) , has grown worryingly high over the year. As of November, the CPI is up 6.8 percent over the year prior, marking the highest inflation rate since the early -1980s. Higher prices are largely driven by the surge in consumer demand coupled with pandemic -related disruptions, which have led to shortages in many markets.

Nonfarm employment will expand by 2.8 percent and slightly outpace national employment growth while the unemployment rate will fall from 7.5 percent in 2020 to 4.7 percent in 2021.

Real GDP in Tennessee will advance by a robust 4.2 percent in 2022 as the labor market continues to recover and supply chain issues are resolved in the near term. This is in line with the nation's forecasted growth rate of 4.3 percent in 2022. Nonfarm employment is projected to fully recover by the second quarter of 2022, and will expand by 3.1 percent for the 2022 year as a whole. By comparison, the national labor market will not recover until the third quarter of 2022. The state's more favorable employment outlook is due to strong employment growth in the manufacturing sector as well as growth in the service sectors as consumers continue to shift back to in- person services and rising wage rates attract more workers. As the labor market recovers, the unemployment rate will continue trending downward, falling to 3.9 percent in 2022 (annual average) and 3.7 percent in 2023. The national unemployment rate will follow a similar trajectory. Nominal personal income in Tennessee, which will grow by a historically high 7.7 percent in 2021, will moderate in 2022. The strong rate of personal income growth in 2021 is driven almost entirely by fiscal stimulus through the 2021 American Rescue Plan (ARP), which pushed Federal transfer payments (e.g. stimulus checks and enhanced unemployment insurance benefits) up by an annualized rate of over 600 percent in the first quarter of 2021. Transfer payments have fallen sharply in the ensuing quarters, as provisions of the ARP have expired, but transfer payments will still grow by 8.0 percent for the 2021 year as a whole. In terms of growth rates, this was comparable to the pattern of transfer payment growth seen in the first half of 2020 that accompanied the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ( CARES Act ). Federal transfer payments will continue to normalize through next year and are projected to fall by 13.4 percent in 2022. Counterbalancing this correction in transfer payments will be strong gains in wages and salaries, driven by both employment growth and increased wages to lower wage workers, as rising prices and labor shortages in some sectors push wages upwards in the short run. Taken together, Tennessee nominal personal income will increase by a moderate 2.1 percent in 2022, but will still outpace projected national income growth of 1.0 percent. Following this heightened volatility, personal income growth will settle into a more stable trajectory and advance by 5.2 percent in 2023, which is more in line with recent historic growth patterns. On a fiscal year basis, nominal personal income in Tennessee will increase by 2.6 percent in fiscal year 20 21-2022 and 5.3 percent in fiscal year 20 22-2023.

The primary source of funding for state expenditures is appropriation from general revenues. General revenues are proceeds from taxes, licenses, fees, fines, forfeitures, and other imposts laid specifically by law. The revenue estimating process generally starts twelve months before a fiscal year begins. Revenue collections are tracked on a monthly basis, and this information, along with specific long- run forecasts of individual sectors of the economy, is used to form the basis for the next fiscal year's estimated revenue collections. Preliminary estimates are supplied to the Department of Finance and Administration in mid- summer by the Department of Revenue and the University of Tennessee's Boyd Center for Business and Economic Research. Tax estimates are recalculated in October and November and refined in December and January for inclusion in the Governor's Budget Document. Sales tax estimates, Tennessee's largest ta x source, are based on broad estimated retail sales activity trends, which are monitored by the Boyd Center for Business and Economic Research and the Department of Revenue. Tax estimates for corporate excise taxes, Tennessee's second largest tax source, include the latest national corporate profit forecasts and are analyzed against the state's October corporate tax returns, which help provide useful information in projecting quarterly estimated tax payments throughout the next year. Estimates for other ex cise taxes are commonly based on long- run consumption trends for the selectively -taxed items: cigarettes, gasoline, beer, and alcoholic beverages. Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) gross receipts tax estimates from in lieu of tax payments are also based on long-run trend analysis. Motor vehicle fuel (primarily diesel fuel) taxes and motor vehicle registration fees are estimated conservatively, given their sensitivity to business cycles. The revenue estimating process in Tennessee incorporates the \"Good Practices in Revenue Estimating\" endorsed by the National Association of State Budget Officers and the Federation of Tax Administrators. This requires using national and state economic for ecasts, developing an official revenue estimate, monitoring and reporting on monthly revenue collections, and revising estimates when appropriate. Tennessee Code Annotated (TCA) 9-4-5104, 5105, 5106, and 5202 specify the manner in which tax revenue estimates are prepared and transmitted to the General Assembly in the Budget Document. The Commissioner of Finance and Administration prepares revenue estimates based on advice from economists, internal staff, the Department of Revenue, and the State Funding Boar d. The State Funding Board, which is composed of the Governor, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, the Comptroller, the State Treasurer, and the Secretary of State, is charged with the responsibility to prepare a range of revenue growth estimat es for the state to begin developing a budget. In preparing its range of revenue growth estimates the State Funding Board listens to forecasts from state university economists, the executive director of the Fiscal Review Committee, and the Department of Revenue. The State Funding Board's review and recommendations concern only the taxes collected by the Department of Revenue. The board's growth estimates provide a basis for the tax revenue estimates that are used in preparing the budget. However, the recommendation of revenue estimates in the budget is the responsibility of the Governor and Commissioner of Finance and Administration.

The State Funding Board's review and recommendations concern only the taxes collected by the Department of Revenue. The board's growth estimates provide a basis for the tax revenue estimates that are used in preparing the budget. However, the recommendation of revenue estimates in the budget is the responsibility of the Governor and Commissioner of Finance and Administration. The State Funding Board's most recent letter notifying the Governor and the chairmen of the A-60 Senate and House Finance, Ways a nd Means committees of its revenue growth estimates is included at the end of the state revenues section in the subsection entitled \"State Funding Board, Range of Tax Revenue Estimates.\" This letter states the economic assumptions that affect the State Fu nding Board's recommendations. A more detailed economic overview is presented in the \"Budget Overview\" section of the Budget Document. The tax revenue estimates recommended in the Budget Document are shown in a following subsection entitled \"Comparison Statement of State Revenues.\" These taxes include not only the taxes collected by the Department of Revenue (the major taxes), but also those collected and deposited to the general fund by some other line agencies in conjunction with carrying out the agencies' programs. In the revenue estimate charts, the latter are shown by collecting agency and are subtotaled as other state revenue. Following the chart comparing taxes for the three fiscal years are three individual charts that show collections by fund. The distribution of taxes among the funds on these charts is as provided by law as it existed for actual revenues in 20 20-2021, and as passed by the 2021 G eneral Assembly for the 2021-2022 estimate s and 2022-2023 estimate s. The funds on the di stribution charts, for the Budget Document presentation, are general fund, education (trust) fund, highway (transportation) fund, debt service fund, and cities and counties (local government) fund. (For information about the inclusion of certain special revenue fund taxes and fees in the general fund estimates, see the \"Budget Process\" section). Following the four tax revenue estimate charts is a chart detailing the revenues of regulatory boards, which contain the collections and estimates listed by board. This is a supporting schedule to the \"Comparison Statement of State Revenues\" charts, on which single lines for regulatory board fees appear. In addition to the general revenues detailed in this section, other revenues are collected by departments, inst itutions, and agencies and are appropriated directly to them. These are called departmental revenues. In the Budget Document, these departmental revenues are estimated by program and are shown as federal revenue, other revenue (or, sometimes, current services and other revenue), and tuition and fees. The term \"other revenue\" includes interdepartmental revenue, current services revenue, non- governmental revenue, and revenue from cities and counties. These various departmental revenues consist of earnings and charges for goods and services; student tuition and fees in the higher education system; and donations, contributions, and grants- in-aid from the federal government, political subdivisions, foundations, corporations, and individuals. In a few cases, the other departmental revenues also include reserves from revolving funds or from the unencumbered balance and capital outlay (major maintenance) reserves, in instances in which specific legal authority to carry such funds forward exists. The departmenta l revenues are reflected in each department's budget as operating revenue. The next subsection titled \"Tax Expenditures\" presents two tax exemption charts labeled \"Items Not in Sales Tax Base\" and \"Major Tax Exemptions,\" as required by law. Subsequently, information presented in the subsection entitled \"Revenue Sources and Basis of Apportionment\" outlines the general tax revenues by collecting agency, along with TCA citations on the rate and source of the revenue and the basis of apportionment among funds and agencies, based on current law. Comparison Statement of State Revenues Actual and Estimated July 1, 20 20 - June 30, 2023 A-61 Senate and House Finance, Ways a nd Means committees of its revenue growth estimates is included at the end of the state revenues section in the subsection entitled \"State Funding Board, Range of Tax Revenue Estimates.\" This letter states the economic assumptions that affect the State Fu nding Board's recommendations.

Following the chart comparing taxes for the three fiscal years are three individual charts that show collections by fund. The distribution of taxes among the funds on these charts is as provided by law as it existed for actual revenues in 20 20-2021, and as passed by the 2021 G eneral Assembly for the 2021-2022 estimate s and 2022-2023 estimate s. The funds on the di stribution charts, for the Budget Document presentation, are general fund, education (trust) fund, highway (transportation) fund, debt service fund, and cities and counties (local government) fund. (For information about the inclusion of certain special revenue fund taxes and fees in the general fund estimates, see the \"Budget Process\" section). Following the four tax revenue estimate charts is a chart detailing the revenues of regulatory boards, which contain the collections and estimates listed by board. This is a supporting schedule to the \"Comparison Statement of State Revenues\" charts, on which single lines for regulatory board fees appear. In addition to the general revenues detailed in this section, other revenues are collected by departments, inst itutions, and agencies and are appropriated directly to them. These are called departmental revenues. In the Budget Document, these departmental revenues are estimated by program and are shown as federal revenue, other revenue (or, sometimes, current services and other revenue), and tuition and fees. The term \"other revenue\" includes interdepartmental revenue, current services revenue, non- governmental revenue, and revenue from cities and counties. These various departmental revenues consist of earnings and charges for goods and services; student tuition and fees in the higher education system; and donations, contributions, and grants- in-aid from the federal government, political subdivisions, foundations, corporations, and individuals. In a few cases, the other departmental revenues also include reserves from revolving funds or from the unencumbered balance and capital outlay (major maintenance) reserves, in instances in which specific legal authority to carry such funds forward exists. The departmenta l revenues are reflected in each department's budget as operating revenue. The next subsection titled \"Tax Expenditures\" presents two tax exemption charts labeled \"Items Not in Sales Tax Base\" and \"Major Tax Exemptions,\" as required by law. Subsequently, information presented in the subsection entitled \"Revenue Sources and Basis of Apportionment\" outlines the general tax revenues by collecting agency, along with TCA citations on the rate and source of the revenue and the basis of apportionment among funds and agencies, based on current law.

This section is intended to fulfill that statutory obligation. Under the law, the Budget Document is required to identify all exemptions f rom state taxes, to the extent that it is practicable, and estimate the amount of revenue that would have been collected by the state in the ensuing fiscal year, if the exemptions were not to exist. No format or reporting period is specified. Tax Exempti ons It is not possible to estimate the amount of revenue lost for each of the tax exemptions found in the Tennessee code. For example, since 1947, the list of nonprofit institutions that are exempt from the sales tax has grown dramatically. Such institutions are allowed to buy tangible goods and certain services tax free. Retailers and sellers require proof of exemption and keep records of exempt sales; but tax returns filed with the Department of Revenue do not show detailed statistics on exempt sales by type of exempt entity. Such data is only available in the records of the thousands of individual retailers and vendors who sell directly to the public. Therefore, the tax exemptions listed in the present report consist only of those that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of accuracy . The fiscal impact of Tennessee's major tax exemptions is presented in tabular form in Tables 1-A and 1- B. Estimates of revenue loss are provided for fiscal year 2022-2023. Table 1- A presents revenue forego ne on services not currently taxed. These services represent activities that were not included in the original tax base. Table 1- B presents revenue foregone due to specific exemptions in the existing sales tax law. For each item in this table, the exemption is briefly described and the specific authorization of the Tennessee code is cited. It is difficult to estimate the true cost of tax exemptions for two reasons. First, each exemption is considered separately, without regard to how it overlaps with other provisions of the tax code. Summing tax exemptions may result in double- counting in cases where exemptions overlap. Second, the estimates of revenue loss provided in the tables do not generally take into account the impact of a change in a particular tax provision on taxpayer behavior that impacts other taxes (the estimates do not reflect secondary or feedback effects) .

Therefore, the tax exemptions listed in the present report consist only of those that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of accuracy . The fiscal impact of Tennessee's major tax exemptions is presented in tabular form in Tables 1-A and 1- B. Estimates of revenue loss are provided for fiscal year 2022-2023. Table 1- A presents revenue forego ne on services not currently taxed. These services represent activities that were not included in the original tax base. Table 1- B presents revenue foregone due to specific exemptions in the existing sales tax law. For each item in this table, the exemption is briefly described and the specific authorization of the Tennessee code is cited. It is difficult to estimate the true cost of tax exemptions for two reasons. First, each exemption is considered separately, without regard to how it overlaps with other provisions of the tax code. Summing tax exemptions may result in double- counting in cases where exemptions overlap. Second, the estimates of revenue loss provided in the tables do not generally take into account the impact of a change in a particular tax provision on taxpayer behavior that impacts other taxes (the estimates do not reflect secondary or feedback effects) .

The board was created by the 45th General Assembly with passage of Public Chapter 126, Public Acts of 1887, codified as Title 9, Chapter 9, and Section 101 of the Tennessee Code. By statute, the state's full faith and credit is pledged on all general obligations and all state revenue collected and allocated to the general fund, the debt service fund, and the highway fund is also charged for payment of principal and interest on such debt obligations issued after July 1, 2013. In addition, the state covenants with the holders of general obligation bonds issued after July 1, 2013, that no additional bonds will be issued unless the amount necessary to pay the maximum annual debt service obligation is 10 percent or less of all state revenue allocate d to the general fund, the debt service fund, and the highway fund for the immediately preceding fiscal year. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, the debt limit calculation produced a maximum annual debt service debt limit of $988,853 ,390. The annual debt service requirement on the state's outstanding debt, authorized but unissued debt, and proposed bond authorizations in the fiscal year 2022-2023 budget total $ 219,928,000, well below the maximum statutory debt limitation . The statutory debt limitation, therefore, provides for a substantial amount of additional debt capacity . Over the years, Tennessee has consistently maintained a relatively low debt burden. This has been accomplished through the use of sound, prudent, and conser vative debt man agement practices adopted by the executive and legislative branches of government, with concurrence of the State Funding Board. Such practices include funding a portion of the state's capital program with surplus cash, cancell ing bond authorizations in lieu of issuing de bt, creatin g and maintaining a Rainy Day Fund to offset unanticipated revenue shortfalls, and adopting state statutes designed to control the issuance of excessive debt. The state continues to maintain a relative low debt burden, and access to the capital markets remains strong . Tennessee's commitment to conservative and prudent debt management is widely recognized by the nation's leading debt -rating agencies. Current ratings on the state's general obligation long- term debt are the highest available: Fitch AAA, Standard and Poor's AAA, and Moody's Investor Service Aaa. Tennessee issued $125,380,000 in additional general obligation debt in the first six months of fiscal year 20 21-2022. As of June 30, 2021, Tennessee's total general obligation bonded indebtednes s was $1,436,291 ,000, excluding the Facilities Revolving Fund (FRF). This debt was issued entirely for institutional and building construction. There were no new general obligation bond authorizations for institutional and building bonds and economic and c ommunity development grants in fiscal year 2021- 2022. Highway bond authorizations totaled $126,000,000. The state's practice of using surplus cash to finance road projects in lieu of issuing debt has been one of the key factors in Tennessee's ability to secure and retain very high bond ratings. Consistent with this long -standing policy, the State Funding Boa rd cancelled $ 74,000,000 in highway construction bonds and $ 8,868,776 in regular general obligation bond authorizations in fiscal year 2020-2021. The reduction in bond authorization coupled with the Funding Board's action on bond cancellations decreased the category of authorized but unissued bonds to $1,244,201,000, which includes $381.8 million in capital construction bonds, $836.0 million in highway fund authorizations, and $26.4 million in FRF bonds. The recommended 20 22-2023 capital budget is funded entirely from surplus cash in the amount of $2,756,043,300 and $278,600,700 from federal funds and other sources.

capital project begins when an agency or department identifies a need that can be met through the Capital Budget Process. At a designated point in the year, agencies and departments submit these project concepts to the Department s of General Services and Finance and Administration. Upon receipt of the capital budget requests, a phased approach of review is undertaken by the Departments of General Services and F inance and Administration . The initial phase focuses on a needs assessment to establish priority and direction. During this pha se, feasibility and/or market studies are performed to determine the viability of the project, project risks, and potential routes of implementation. The goal of the initial phase is to generate a recommend ation regarding the disposition of the project. The next phase provides additional planning to develop better cost estimates. The end result of the above phased approach is the development and prioritization of a formal capital budget request. The various agencies and departments annually submit both their capital maintenance and capital improvement requests in priority order to the Department of Finance and Administration , Division of Budget . All capital budget requests are further reviewed on both a technical and financial basis upon receipt by the Department of Finance and Administration, Division of Budget . The projects are analyzed for funding requirements and consistency with program goals and are re viewed within projected availability of funds in the budget for the requested fiscal year. If funds are deemed to be insufficient, individual projects may be deferred to be included in future budgets or rejected. The a dministration intends for the needs of departmental programs to be the impe tus for all capital outlay, support program , and servi ce requirements . Funding of projects is analyzed on priority of fiscal support for individual existing and new programs t o find the best mix of capital improvements and maintenance to sustain and implement programs. The management of facilities should be flexible enough to adjust to changing programs through renovation of existing assets. Attempts are made to minimize operational costs and future capital expenditures through better design and more flexible layouts. When a capital project creates the need for additional operational funding, the operating costs are identified d uring the capital budget review and further re viewed in the develo pment of the budget in the year when the new space is expected to be occupied. Improvements to real property funded by public or private funds must be approved by the State Building Commission, comprised of seven ex- officio members: the Governor, the Secretary of State, the Comptroller of the Treasury, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, the Treasurer , and the Speakers of the Senate and House of Representatives. The State Building Commission, in addition to supervising improvements to real property, oversees leases by state agencies and the demolition of structures located on state property. The capital items presented in this document as recommendations to the General Assembly reflect projects meeting State Building Commis sion requirements and policy guide lines. Capital maintenance projects are defined as major, non- routine repairs and replacements unrelated to new construction and costing $100,000 or more. Maintenance projects costing less than this amount are addressed within the departments' operational budget major maintenance programs. Capital maintenance projects include items that appreciabl y extend the life of the facility, such as alterations to rectify code deficiencies, modifica tions for health and safety issues, repairs to improve utility systems, repaving, roof repairs, exterior fencing and lighting, and repair projects that restore a facility to its former con dition and do not result in changes in facility use. Funding for these projects is allocated to the individual state entities .

Funding for these projects is allocated to the individual state entities . A-132 Capital improvement projects are defined as those providing new facilities or materially extending the useful life and improving or changing the function of an existing facility. These projects include facility renovation, new construction, new utility or service systems, land with or without buildings, appurtenances, site improvements or permanent betterments, and initial equipment to furnish and operate a new or improved facility that require s the assistance of a design professional or costs $100,000 or more. The 2022-2023 capital appropriations budget recom mends $ 3,034,644,000 divided between capital improvement projects and capital maintenance requests . The recommendation includes $2,314.8 m illion for capital outlay, $709.8 million for the Facilities Revolving Fund, and $10.1 million for projects funded from dedicated sources of revenue. Capital Outlay Improvement Projects \u2014 Capital outlay improvement projects recom mended for fi scal year 20 22-2023 total $2,010,267,000, including $1,928,691,800 from state appropriation. O ther funding sources account for the remainder of the total amount. The recommendation includes $1,176.7 million for Higher Education projects, $224.0 million for state parks, and various upgrades to state facilities. Capital Outlay Maintenance Projects \u2014 Capital outlay maintenance projects are recom mended at a level o f $304 ,532,0 00. A st ate appropriation of $168,571,500 is requested. Federal and o ther funding sources account for the remainder of the total amount. These projects focus on maintaining current f acilities, primarily through repair and renovation of roofing, mechanical, and electrical systems. Funding is also included to bring state facilities in line with federal st andards for asbestos and citizens with disabilities. New Bond Authorizations \u2014 Total capital maintenance, capital improvements, and Facilities Revolving Fund requests will require no new bond authorization. T he following chart compares the bond authori zations recommended with those approved by the General Assembly during the past several years. Facilities Revolving Fund \u2014 Capital fund ing in the amount of $709,780,000 is recommended for capital mainte nance and capital i mprovement projects. A general fund appropriation of $658,780,000 is rec- ommended. Other funding sources account for the remainder of the total amount. These projects are listed in the \"Facilities Revolving Fund\" section, which follows the \"Capital Budget \" section of this document. Dedicated Sources of Revenue \u2014 Projects from dedicated sources of revenue in the amount of $10,065,000 are also recommended. The recommendation includes $8.2 million for improvement projects and $1.9 million for maintenance project for the Tennessee Department of Transportation. These projects are included in the \"Capital Budget\" section of this document under the heading \"Projects Funded from Dedicated Revenues\". Operat ing Costs \u2014 This section includes estimates of the first- year operating costs resulting from proposed new construction.

It consists of four-year universities, two-year community colleges, and colleges of applied technology. The institutions span the state and are reported as a network of public education with each campus offering unique characteristics and services. The Focus on College and University Success (FOCUS) Act of 2016 required the Governor to appoint independent governing boards for each of the six four-year universities (hereafter referred to as Locally Governed Institutions) that were previously a part of the Board of Regents. As of March 2017, each of the universities operates independently from the system, with the board maintaining authority over the operating budget of each university to ensure Tennessee state school bond financing agreements are met.

Judicial power is vested in trial courts and two levels of appeals courts that comprise the state's court system. The Supreme Court is comprised of five justices elected to eight-year terms. The workload of the court consists of cases appealed from lower courts. Supreme Court decisions act to resolve controversies arising out of Tennessee law and to establish guidelines for the lower courts to use in future decisions. The intermediate appellate courts are the Court of Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals. The Court of Appeals hears appeals only in civil cases from the lower courts. The Court of Criminal Appeals has jurisdiction to hear most felony and misdemeanor appeals from general trial courts, as well as post- conviction petitions. The state 's trial courts include Chancery, Criminal, Circuit, and Probate courts. Chancery courts are the traditional equity courts used when common law or statutory law proves inadequate for cases. Circuit courts, which sometimes overlap with the jurisdiction of Chancery courts, have jurisdiction to hear civil and criminal cases. Criminal courts have jurisdiction over criminal cases and hearing misdemeanor appeals from lower courts. Probate courts have primary jurisdiction over probate of wills and administration of estates. Courts of limited jurisdiction are funded locally and include General Sessions, Juvenile, and Municipal courts. Jurisdiction of General Sessions courts vary by county based on state laws and private acts; they hear civil, criminal, and juvenile cases, except in counties in which the Legislature has established separate Juvenile courts. Municipal courts have jurisdiction in cases involving violations of city ordinances.

The Neighborhood Stabilization program provides grants to nonprofit organizations and local governments that buy foreclosed homes, rehabilitate, and rent or resell the homes to low- to middle-income families in order to help stabilize the housing market. The agency received proceeds from the national mortgage settlement fund that are being utilized to support activities aimed to prevent foreclosures. Since fiscal year 2013-2014, THDA has administered two federal programs previously administered by the Department of Human Services. The Weatherization Assistance Program enables low-income families to permanently reduce their energy bills by making their homes more energy efficient. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program helps keep families safe and healthy through initiatives that assist families with energy costs. Activities of THDA include the rehabilitation and construction of rental and homeowner housing.

Since fiscal year 2013-2014, THDA has administered two federal programs previously administered by the Department of Human Services. The Weatherization Assistance Program enables low-income families to permanently reduce their energy bills by making their homes more energy efficient.

Budget Planning and Estimation Immediately after a new fiscal year begins each July, the staff of the Division of Budget begins making plans for the budget that will be considered by the General Assembly for the subsequent fiscal year. These plans include updating instructions used by departments and agencies in presenting operational and capital budget requests to the Division of Budget. The instructions , which are distributed to agencies in August, include submitting three levels of requests: (a) a base request, which accommoda tes the contin uation of cur- rent services, (b) a cost increase request, which includes funds to implement mandated requirements, compensate for revenue reduc- tions, initiate new programs, or enhance the base level due to increased costs of providing current services , and (c) a base budget reduc- tion request . A s part of a cost increase request, a gencies may request to use statutory B-365 State of Tennessee The Budget Process Preparation of the Governor's annual budget for the State of Tennessee is the responsibility of the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, w ho is the State Budget Director. Within the Department of Finance and Administration, the Division of Budget is responsibl e for budget development. Preparation, deliberation, and execution of the budget is a continual process throughout the year. This process regularly involves the legislative and executive branches, with occasional counsel from the judicial branch. The fo llowing table indicates the participants in the budgetary process and an approximate time schedule.

Preparation and Executive Review of Strategic Plan s The Government al Accountability Act of 2013 amended the Governmental Accountability Act of 2002, which requires strategic planning, performance measures, and performance audits. The Commissioner of Finance and Administration annually issues instructions for strategic p lans and performance measures to the executive branch agencies, which are due to the commissioner by August 15 each year . The commissioner reviews the plans and measures, revise s as deemed necessary , approves, and submits the strategic plans to the Governor and General Assembly by September 30 of each year. The judicial and legislative branches, the constitutional office rs, and the Attorney General and Reporter submit plans separately to the Governor and General Assembly by September 30. Budget Planning and Estimation Immediately after a new fiscal year begins each July, the staff of the Division of Budget begins making plans for the budget that will be considered by the General Assembly for the subsequent fiscal year. These plans include updating instructions used by departments and agencies in presenting operational and capital budget requests to the Division of Budget.

A s part of a cost increase request, a gencies may request to use statutory B-366 The Budget Process reserves , which are funds held for future needs or special purposes as designated in statute and / or the Appropriations Bill. The legal deadline for completi ng and transmi tting budget requests is the first of October. During the preparation period, the Division of Budget staff meets as needed with agencies' fiscal , capital , and program personnel to answer qu estions and provide assistance with developing agencies' budget requests. In addition to projecting expenditure levels, estimates of the major revenue sources, such as the sales, franchise, excise , and gasoline taxes, are prepared for both the current and next fiscal years. The revenue estimates are prepared by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration after receiving advice from the State Funding Board, as required by TCA section 9-4- 5202. All revenue estimates, including estimates for licenses and fees, are part of the budget review by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, the Governor, and the Commissioner of Finance and Administration 's and the Governor' s staffs. Preparation of the Budget Chapter 33 of the Public Acts of 1937 grant s the Governor the authority and duty to develop and submit to the General Assembly a recommended budget. The law directs the Commissioner of Finance and Administration to prepare the budget in accordance with the Governor's directives. After rec eiving agency operational and capital budget requests, analysts with the Di- vision of Budget begin the process of balancing expenditures against estimated revenues. Capital budget requests are re- viewed in conjunction with the Real Estate Asset Management office. Following analysis of the operational and capital requests and available funding, as well as resolving any questions about the requests with agencies , detailed recommendations are made to the Commissioner of Finance and Administration. Meetings are convened with department commissioners and agency direct ors by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration. After these meetings are completed, the Division of Budget staff makes revisions and presents the estimates to the Commissioner of Finance and Administration for his and the Governor's consideration. The Governor and the commissioner review the recommendations resulting from these hearings and consider necessary alterations to fit within the scope of the administration's initiatives , activities mandated by state or federal statute, day -to-day operati ons, and estimated revenues. The Governor may choose to conduct meetings or budget hearings with department commissioners and may direct them to submit plans for furthe r budget adjustments . After gubernatorial decisions have been finalized, the staff of the Division of Budget prepares the Budget Document for printing. Meanwhile, work begins on the Governor's Budget Message. The Budget Document must be presented to the General Assembly prior to February 1, or prior to March 1 when a newly electe d Governor takes office, unless the General Assembly by joint resolution allows submission on a later date. At the time the Budget Document and Budget Message are presented, the appropriation process is initiated. Legislative Deliberation The Appropriations Bill, prepared by the Division of Budget, is introduced and referred to the Finance, Ways and Means committees of both houses of the Legislature. The various standing committees of the houses may review those parts of the Appropriations B ill that fall within the committees' purviews. The departments and agencies often are invited to testify before these committees on budget issues. After these committees report t he committees ' reviews, the Finance, Ways and Means committees begin hearings on the budget in its entirety. Again, the departments may testify, and the Commissioner of Finance and Administration is invited to discuss the budget recom mendations. Considerations made by the committees The Budget Process include the fiscal impacts caused by other legislation introduced by the members of both houses, recommendations of other legislative committees, and Appropriations Bill amendments filed by members of the Legislature. The Finance, Ways and Means committees of each house report out the Appropriations Bill with any recommended amendments. The Appropriations Bill is then sent to Calendar committees of each house to be scheduled for floor action. The Senate and House of Representatives must pass the same Appropriations Bill in the same form for it to be enacted into law. Approval of the General Appropriations Bill usually occurs during the last week of the legislative session. In signing the bill into la w, the Governor may line-item veto or reduce specific appropriations. Th e Governor could veto the entire bill, but this rarely would be done. Any veto may be over- ridden by a majority of the elected members, each house acting separately. Tennessee has a tradition of enacting a single General Appropriations Act. Budget Execution When passage of the Appropriations Bill is complete and is signed or enacted into law, the execution of the act begins. Two important concepts are involved: preparation of work programs and development of allotment controls. Invariably, there are changes to the Budget Document presented by the Governor to the General Assembly. These changes are made by amending the Appropriations Act during the adoption process. Analysts of the Division of Budget and fiscal personnel in the departments and agencies have the responsibility of reconciling the approved Appropriations Act with the Budget Document. This may involve increases or decreases to the agency allotments. The Division of Budget establishes an annual allotment for each agency and division using the reconciled Appropriations Act. This annual allotment, called the official work program, is provided to the Division of Accounts as a means of spending control. The agencies and division s spend against these allotments during the fiscal year. The approved Appropriations Act also contains overappropriation amounts, or reversion, which is the return of any unused portion of appropriation or revenue overcollection. The Division of Budget estimates the proportion of the total reversion in the Appropriations Act to be allocated to each agency and informs each agency of its target reversion . Budget execution is a process that continues throughout the fiscal year. In addition to the daily review of numerous operational and personnel transaction requests, the budget analysts must ensure that the legislative intent of the Appropriations Act is being followed by the various departments and agencies. Analysts review the status of the various a llotments and reversion targets and advise the Commissioner of Finance and Administration of any problems. Analysts may also receive agency requests for supplemental appropriations for state dollars after the beginning of the fiscal year, which become par t of the next year's budget discussions and recommendations to be included in the next Budget Document and Appropriations Bill. Additionally, a nalysts may receive agency requests for new federally or other funded programs, expansions of existing federally or other funded programs , or redirected funds after the beginning of the fiscal year. These requests, known as expansion request s, are reviewed within the Division of Budget, and then sent to the Finance, Ways and Means c ommittees for approval. Agencies may not expand programs or implement new programs on the agencies' own authority. This expansion procedure is not used to increase allotments funded from state tax revenue sources. No approp riations from state tax sources may be increased except pursuant to appropriations made by law. At the end of the fiscal year, the Division of Budget has the responsibility of executing revisions to the annual allotments as a function of the accounts closing process.

A t B-368 The Budget Process closing, a gencies may request to carry forward unexpended state appropriations for the specified purpose , provided the agencies have the authority in statute or the Appropriations Act to do so. A gencies may request to use reserve funds, which are funds held for future needs or special purposes, with statutory reserve authority. The Commissioner of Finance and Administration can approve agency requests for carry forward s and use of reserve funds. TCA section 4 -3-1016 gives t he Commissioner of Finance and Administration authority to deny carry forwards for and to transfer funds to the general fund to meet funding requirements, subject to specific provisions in the Appropriations B ill. The funds, reserves, and programs authorized for transfer are listed in the above TCA citation. These transfers are known as reserve taking to close the fiscal year. Legislative Review Further legislative review and control is maintained throughout the year through the Fiscal Review Committee and the Finance, Ways and Means committees. In addition to the review of agency activities by these bodies, the Finance, Ways and Means committees review and approve expansion requests of new or existing federally or other funded programs. If the expansion request is approved, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration may allot the additional departmental revenue to implement the proposed or expanded program. Additionally, a committee comprised of the Speakers of the House and the Senate, and the Comptroller of the Treasury must approve a transfer of appropriations between allotments for purposes other than those for which they were appropriated after approval of the Commissioner of Finance and Administration. Comptroller Audit and Review Post-audit and performance review are functions that continue throughout the fiscal year. The Division of State Audit, within the Comptroller's Office, has the duty of conducting, supervising, and monitoring the audits and performance reviews of all state departments and agencies, i ntermediate care facilities receiving Medicaid funds , and other entities receiving state grants. The General Assembly may review the Comptroller's audit reports and performance reviews, and agency personnel may respond to inquirie s about activities and programs under the agency's jurisdiction. State of Tennessee Basis of Budgeting and Accounting Budgeting Basis The annual Budget of the State of Tennessee is prepared on the modif ied accrual basis of accounting - the method under which revenues are recognized when they become available and measurable, and expenditures are recognized when the liability is incurred. Most appropriations generally lapse at the end of each fiscal year. Appropriations for contractual obligations in the highway fund do not lapse at year end but are carried forward for subsequent year expenditure s. In addition, it is the s tate's budgetary practice to appropriate matching dollars for jointly funded projects in the year of federal apportionment. Most revenue collection estimates are presented on a modified accrual basis, consistent with the basis of accounting explained below. The law requires the Go vernor to present his proposed B udget to the General Assembly annually. The General Assembly enacts the Budget through passage of a general appropriations act. This act appropriates funds at the progr am level. Before signing the Appropriations Act, the Governor may veto or reduce any specific appropriation, subject to legislative override. Once passed and signed, the Budget , in the form of the Appropriations Act, becomes the state's financial plan fo r the coming year. Budgetary control is maintained at the program level by the individual departments and agencies, acting in conjunction with the Department of Finance and Administration. The latter has a Division of Budget and a Division of Accounts to execute budgetary controls. The Budget Document details the separation between payroll and operational funds by program. Any movement of funds between the payroll and operational funds requires approval and a revision to the budget by the Division of Budget on behalf of the Commissioner of Finance and Administration and the Governor. Other budget revisions during the year, reflecting program changes or intradepartmental transfers of an administrative nature, require certain executive and legislative branch approval, pursuant to law. This is discussed in de tail in the \"Budget Process\" section. With proper legal authority, the Division of Budget, acting on behalf of the Governor and Commissioner of Finance and Administration, may execute allotment (or budget) revisions. The line agencies may not make these revisions themselves. In Tennessee, as in other states, appropriation of funds is a legislative power, not an executive power. No expenditures may be made and no allotments increased, except pursuant to appropriations made by law. For Budget Document purposes, all funds are classified as General Fund except for the Department of Transportation (t ransportation, or highway fund), Capital Outlay ( capital projects fund ), facilities revolving fund , debt service (or sinking ) fund, and Cities and Counties - State -Shared Taxes (Local Government Fund). The Education Trust Fund, including the Lottery for Education Account, for which state tax revenues are estimated separately, is included in the general fund in the presentation of the \" Budget Overview ,\" although a separate fund balance statement for this fund is included in the \"Financial Statements\" section of the Budget Document. The presentation of all the operating budgets within the General Fund in the Budget Document , except for Transportation, is done for ease of budget presentation and understanding. In the Budget Document , revenue estimates for special revenue, internal service , and enterprise fund programs, funded by dedicated revenues, are included in the state tax revenue and departmental revenue estimates in the general fund, as are those programs' expenditures. Special Revenue Fund programs reflected in the general fund in the Budget Document are: Wildlife Resources Agency Boating Safety Wetlands Acquisition Fund Wetlands Compensation Fund Tennessee Public Utility Commission Education Fund B-369 The Budget Process closing, a gencies may request to carry forward unexpended state appropriations for the specified purpose , provided the agencies have the authority in statute or the Appropriations Act to do so.

Enterprise Fund programs reflected in the general fund in the Budget Document are: Tennessee Housing Development Agency Grain Indemnity Fund Client Protection Fund. In the \"Budget Overview,\" Education Trust Fund programs are presented in the general fund, although the tax apportionments for the education fund are separately estimated. This, again, is done for ease of presentation and understanding of the Budget . It also is done because the taxes earmarked and apportioned to the education fund are less than the education appropriations, requiring general fund tax support for education programs. The programs in the Education Trust Fund are: (1) Department of Education (K -12), including general -source programs and the dedicated -source After -School Programs Special Account, funded by 100% of unclaimed lottery prizes; (2) Higher Education, including state appropriations for the University of Tennessee, the State University and Community College System (Board of Regents) , the Foreign Language Center , and the dedicated -source appropriation in the Lottery for Educat ion Account; and (3) all funding sources for programs of the Higher Education Commission and the Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation. In the Budget Document , certain institutional revenues for the two university systems are estimated. These include unrestricted educational and general revenues (E&G), and auxiliary enterprise funds. Examples of unrestricted E&G funds are student tuition and fees; unrestricted state, federal, local, and private gifts, grants, and contracts; local appropriations; and s ales and services related to academic programs. Restricted funds are not reflected in the Budget Document. Although presenting the operating budgets in this consolidated fashion makes the Budget Document easier to understand, the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report ( ACFR) does present the special revenue and other funds separately from the general fund. The Division of Accounts provides that document to the General Assembly and the public. Basis of Budgeting and Accounting Accounting Basis (From Division of Accounts, Annual Comprehensive Financial Report) The financial statements of the State of Tennessee are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). These principles require that the finan cial statements present the primary government and its component units, or the entities for which the government is considered to be financially accountable. Component units are discretely presented in a separate column in the government -wide financial st atements to emphasize legal separation from the primary government. In the government -wide financial statements, the financial activities of the state are reported as governmental or business -type activities. The government -wide financial statements are r eported using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. In the fund financial statements, the state's major governmental funds include: General Fund - used to account for all financial transactions not required to be accounted for in other funds; Education Fund - used to account for revenues and expenditures associated with programs involving the Department s of Education and Higher Education. Funding is provided primarily from the dedicated sales and services taxes and federal monies received from the U.S. Department of Education. Net education lottery proceeds and 100% of unclaimed lottery prizes fund higher education scholarships and a fter-school programs; Highway Fund - used to account for revenues and expenditures associated with the Department of Transportation. Funding is provided from dedicated highway user taxes and funds received from the various federal transportation agen cies; Capital Projects Fund - used to account for the acquisition or construction of all major governmental capital facilities ; and, State Sha red Taxes F und - used to account for the sharing of st ate levied tax revenues and certain fees with lo cal city a nd county governments as a uthorized by state statu tes. The state's non- major governmental funds , reported in a single column, include: Special Revenue Fund - used to account for specific revenues earmarked to finance particular or restricted programs and activities; Debt Service Fund - used to account for the payment of principal and interest on general long- term debt; and, Permanent Funds - used to account for legally restricted funds where only earnings, not principal, can be spent. All of the gover nmental funds are reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Under this basis, revenues are recognized when they become measurable and av ailable. Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting. However, debt service expenditures, as well as expenditures related to compensated absences and claims and judgments, are typically recorded only when payment is due. Principal revenue sources considered susceptible to accrual include taxes, federal funds, local funds , and investment income. Taxes and similarly measurable fe es and fines, are generally considered to be available if collected within 60 days after fiscal year -end. Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue when all eligibility requirements impose d by the provider have been met, and the amount is received during the current period or within six months after fiscal year -end. The state uses this same six -month availability period for most other measurable revenues. However , tobacco and similar litigation settlement proceeds are generally considered available if collection is expected within 12 B-371 Basis of Budgeting and Accounting Agricultural Resources Conservation Fund Certified Cotton Growers' Organization Fund Agricultural Regulatory Fund Local Parks Acquisition Fund State Lands Acquisition Fund State Lands Compensation Fund Used Oil Collection Program Tennessee Dry Cleaners Environmental Response Fund Abandoned Lands Hazardous Waste Remedial Action Fund Underground Storage Tanks Solid Waste Assistance Environmental Protection Fund Criminal Injuries Compensation 911 Emergency Communications Fund Motorcycle Rider Education Driver Education Anti-Theft Unit Board of Professional Responsibility Tennessee Lawyers Assistance Program Continuing Legal Education Help America V ote Act Vehic le Tag and A nalogous Fees.

The government -wide financial statements are r eported using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. In the fund financial statements, the state's major governmental funds include: General Fund - used to account for all financial transactions not required to be accounted for in other funds; Education Fund - used to account for revenues and expenditures associated with programs involving the Department s of Education and Higher Education. Funding is provided primarily from the dedicated sales and services taxes and federal monies received from the U.S. Department of Education.

All of the gover nmental funds are reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Under this basis, revenues are recognized when they become measurable and av ailable. Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting. However, debt service expenditures, as well as expenditures related to compensated absences and claims and judgments, are typically recorded only when payment is due. Principal revenue sources considered susceptible to accrual include taxes, federal funds, local funds , and investment income. Taxes and similarly measurable fe es and fines, are generally considered to be available if collected within 60 days after fiscal year -end. Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue when all eligibility requirements impose d by the provider have been met, and the amount is received during the current period or within six months after fiscal year -end. The state uses this same six -month availability period for most other measurable revenues. However , tobacco and similar litigation settlement proceeds are generally considered available if collection is expected within 12 B-372 Basis of Budgeting and Accounting months after fiscal year -end. Licenses, permits, and other similar miscellaneous revenue items are considered measurable and available only when cash is received by the state.
