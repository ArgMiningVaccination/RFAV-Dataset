In 2022, energy consumption growth slowed down in the two largest consuming countries: it increased by 3% (compared to +5.2% in 2021) in China, the world's largest energy consumer (25% in 2022), while it rose by 1.8% in the USA (+4.9% in 2021). Strong economic growth pulled energy consumption in India (+7.3%), Indonesia (+21%) and Saudi Arabia (+8.4%), and to a lesser extent in Canada (+3.8%) and in Latin America (+2.7%, including +2.4% in Brazil and Mexico and +4.5% in Argentina). It also increased by around 3% in the Middle East and Africa (despite a 4.5% consumption drop in South Africa due to coal supply tensions and forced loadshedding in the power sector). On the contrary, primary energy consumption declined in Europe (-4%, including -4.4% in the EU, and around -3% in the UK and T\u00fcrkiye), as fears of recession after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, surging energy prices and milder temperatures incited industrial and residential consumers to cut their energy demand. In the CIS, energy consumption dipped by 3.2%, due to the war in Ukraine (-29%) and Western sanctions against Russia (-0.4%). Energy consumption in OECD-Asia remained broadly stable (South Korea, Australia) or slightly dipped (-1.1% in Japan). Enerdata's Global Energy and Climate Trends report analyses key statistics, the Global Stocktake and the natural gas crisis resulting from the Ukraine conflict. Need more data?
