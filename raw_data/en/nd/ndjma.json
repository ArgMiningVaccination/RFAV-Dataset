ASK HOW VIVOTIF MAY HELP PROTECT YOU WHILE TRAVELING TO TYPHOID FEVER-AFFECTED AREAS. VIVOTIF is a prescription vaccine you take by mouth to help protect you from typhoid fever. Typhoid is a disease caused by a type of bacteria called Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. VIVOTIF is for adults and children ages 6 and older. Immunization with VIVOTIF is not routinely recommended for people living in the United States. However, VIVOTIF is recommended for people who are at a higher risk of getting typhoid. This includes: Not all people will be fully protected from typhoid following vaccination. While you travel, you should take care to ensure the food you eat and water you drink are safe. It is unknown whether VIVOTIF protects from common source outbreaks of typhoid, disease following natural disasters, or in people attending rural summer camps. VIVOTIF will not protect you from other kinds of Salmonella bacteria and will not treat typhoid fever if you have been infected. Children under the age of 6 should not take VIVOTIF. Do not use VIVOTIF if you are allergic to any of the ingredients in the vaccine or the enteric-coated capsule. Do not take VIVOTIF if you have an active fever or if your immune system is weakened by a disease or other medicines you take. Tell your healthcare provider (HCP) if you have sudden stomach or intestinal illness. If you are vomiting or have diarrhea that will not stop, do not take VIVOTIF until the vomiting and diarrhea have stopped. It is important to take VIVOTIF exactly as your HCP tells you. VIVOTIF may not fully protect you from typhoid if you miss a dose. Not everyone that takes VIVOTIF will be fully protected against typhoid. Tell your HCP about all the prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements you take. Taking VIVOTIF with certain other medications may affect how VIVOTIF works and may cause side effects. The most common side effects of VIVOTIF are abdominal pain, nausea, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and skin rash. Only nausea was more common in people that took VIVOTIF compared with those who took a sugar pill. These are not all the possible side effects of VIVOTIF. Talk to your healthcare provider about any side effects you experience. You can report side effects to the FDA at [1-800-822-7967](tel:1-800-822-7967) or [vaers.hhs.gov](https://vaers.hhs.gov/).
