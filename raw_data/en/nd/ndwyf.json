The summer of 2018 has been a scorcher exacerbating an already difficult body odour (B.O) situation when stuck in busy tubes, lifts, and long commutes. And yes, we all know that for most people, a spray of deodorant and a thorough wash is all that is needed. Early diagnosis is crucial - we are calling on all of you to make unexpected changes in your body seriously, to stop burying your head in the sand, and be on the case those stubborn people in your life to get checked up. Sadly, an extremely squeezed NHS means that small changes are rarely looked into, so you should really think about investing in your health by going to a private clinic. Non-serious reasons why someone might smell a little - Firstly, of course, is poor personal hygiene. - Secondly, they may be eating certain foods that when flushed out through the skin, cause a strong smell. Garlic and spices are the usual offenders. - Thirdly, it can also be related to hormonal changes (which is why teenagers tend to pong, poor mites) and extreme physical or mental stress. Therefore, most cases of body odour will have a relatively simple or transient cause. However, if someone SUDDENLY starts smelling bad who didn't before, it's unlikely that they've just suddenly decided to stop washing or eating a whole new diet, right? Serious reasons why you or someone you know might start to smell Diabetes One of the most common reasons is [diabetes](https://www.harleyhealthcentre.com/health-screening/diabetes), also known as the silent killer. Diabetes is a serious and life-long condition where your body is unable to produce enough insulin, or use it well enough, to regulate the sugar levels in the blood. When you have diabetes your glucose levels are too high. If your blood sugar is poorly controlled, you develop something called ketoacidosis which results not only in a strange breath smell like an old fruit bowl but also a distinctive body odour. You need to get checked out right away if this is happening to you. It's no joke and no, it can't wait until next week. Kidney or Liver disease Another reason for a bad body smell is serious kidney or liver disease. These crucial organs are responsible for processing and eliminating toxins from the body. If they cannot do this, the body will smell differently and more strongly. In addition to changes in urination and other symptoms, this could certainly indicate kidney or liver damage, or disease and it is vital to get checked out by a medical doctor quickly. Overactive Thyroid Finally, an overactive thyroid can cause the body to smell due to the increase in sweat due to the hyperfunction of the [thyroid gland](https://www.harleyhealthcentre.com/blood-tests/thyroid-function-tests). Thyroid dysfunction has many long-term and immediate-term health implications. If you are sweating too much, take it seriously. Overall, strong body odour is likely to have a simple cause but if it is an unexpected and unexplained change or is not going away with the usual changes to personal hygiene, you really should see your doctor.
