Bloomberg In the hours, days, weeks and months following the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, New York City Firefighters and emergency services personnel were called upon to make extraordinary sacrifices.Your heroic rescue and recovery efforts, which were the embodiment of selflessness, formed the founda-tion of the City's post-9/11 rebirth. In the years that have passed since the attacks, the FDNY's Bureau of Health Services has kept close track of how work at the site affected rescue workers, physically and emotionally. This report is the result of theirpainstaking efforts to study the long-term effects of the rescue and recovery effort on the people who carriedit out. Hopefully, it will give all of you an overview and a better understanding of how first responders as agroup were, and continue to be, affected. The more information we have about this situation, the better ablewe will be to provide monitoring and treatment to those who need it. In September 2006, I appointed a WTC Health Panel composed of representatives from all City agencies that serve or represent individuals affected or potentially affected by WTC-related illnesses. The Panel mem-bers were asked to develop recommendations to ensure that WTC health resources are sufficient to providefirst-rate care for everyone whose health was or may be affected by the WTC attacks and their aftermath. ThePanel also was asked to make recommendations to guarantee that City policies regarding WTC-relatedhealth issues are coordinated, comprehensive and responsive to both current and emerging health careneeds. The Panel's report, \"Addressing the Health Impacts of 9/11,\" as well as my subsequent testimonybefore the U.S. Senate, stressed the need for federal funding to fully support all WTC-related medical mon-itoring and treatment programs, including this critical program at FDNY. I accepted all of the Panel's recom-mendations, which we are working to implement. This is just one small part of what the City of New York owes to you, our Firefighters and emergency medical personnel. Please know that the herculean efforts carried out by the FDNY's first responders on 9/11 and inthe months thereafter will never be forgotten. IImpacts oon FFDNY RRescue WWorkers 4When the World Trade Center collapsed on 9/11, it unleashed a cloud of dust and debris the likes of which this City had never seen before. Among the manyunknowns in the aftermath of that terrible day, one that loomed particularly largewas the question of how that cloud would affect our members' health. The FDNY's Chief Medical Officers, Drs. Kerry Kelly and David Prezant, realized almost immediate-ly after the attack that the short- and long-term effects of exposure to the World Trade Centersite needed to be monitored. Together with a host of partners--from Fire and EMS unions, to theNational Institute of Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH)--they created a program specifical-ly tailored to the needs of our members. It monitors not only the medical, but also the psycho-logical effects that this catastrophe had, and continues to have, on our first responders. More than 14,200 FDNY first responders have been examined by BHS during the past five years. This report presents the data culled from those examinations in a clear, understandable format.These objective data were an important part of the Mayor's WTC Health Panel's deliberationsand recommendations contained in the report, \"Addressing the Health Impacts of 9-11.\" Theinformation contained in both of these reports will help us not only deliver the health servicesthat best fit our members' needs, but also help ensure future funding by presenting comprehen-sive data on our needs. To those who labored at the WTC site, this report comes with a pledge: We will continue to pro- vide our members with the best medical and psychological monitoring and treatment for as longas it is needed.Message from the Fire Commissioner several long, difficult months after 9/11, thousands of you worked rescue and recov- ery at the site where the Towers had stood and where 343 FDNY members lost theirlives. I witnessed firsthand the many days, nights, weekends and holidays our Firefightersspent there, under physically and mentally grueling conditions. It was a painful time that none of us will ever forget. And, unfortunately, it has left us with a lot of questions regarding thelong-term effects on our members. Thankfully, the Bureau of Health Services was there with us from the very beginning. On the very day of the attacks, they observed first responders suffering a variety of conditions--from eye andskin irritation, to nasal congestion and breathing difficulties. As the weeks and months passed,they continued to monitor and treat our Firefighters and EMS personnel for their physical andpsychological needs. This report is designed to give you an overview of how the World Trade Center first responders, as a group, have been affected medically by their work at the site. More than 14,200 of youcontributed, making this one of the most comprehensive studies done on the subject. Read itcarefully. But remember that it is important to continue your participation in the monitoring pro-gram, because having such valuable data will help us secure funding to continue with this workin the future. Thank you all for your dedication to this Department in the aftermath of 9/11. Your sacrifices will not be forgotten.Message from the Chief of Department Salvatore J. pleased to see the important work of the FDNY compiled in this new book. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has provided funding since 2002 to FDNY for medical screening, mon-itoring and treatment. As Director of NIOSH, I became aware shortly after 9/11 that responders, their familiesand others were deeply concerned with the question of whether exposures to airborne contaminants at Ground Zero posed ongoing risks for adverse health effects. It also became clear that robust scientific studies, based on goodclinical assessments, were key for identifying symptoms and trends in health effects that could be used to begin toanswer the question. Since that time, I have had the opportunity to meet many of you who served at Ground Zero. I have been touched by your stories of heroism, hope and faith. FDNY has been a leader in efforts to address thequestions about health effects associated with WTC exposures. Early on, as a partner in federally funded programs,FDNY provided medical screening and monitoring of responders. Those efforts laid the groundwork for subsequentinitiatives to identify trends in illness among FDNY responders, both individually and collectively, to publish scientificstudies that are invaluable for furthering our collective knowledge and to guide treatment. The FDNY program notonly provides needed medical care, it also captures data that will help us develop an accurate picture of the 9/11health outcomes, greatly increasing the ability to identify, prevent and treat illnesses. I am impressed by the quality of the program, as reflected by the contents of this book, and I look forward to contin- ued partnership with you, FDNY, and others to answer the questions that concern us all. Sincerely,Letter from John Howard, MD, Director National Institute for Occupational Safety and HealthCenters for Disease Control and Prevention World TTrade CCenter HHealth IImpacts oon FFDNY RRescue WWorkers 6 In the aftermath of 9/11, the health consequences to our FDNY members (Fire and EMS) were both immediate and far-reaching. In the hours after the collapses, members fought to survive while working to find lost coworkersand civilians. They struggled to breathe particle-laden air and to clear eyes, noses and mouths of fallen debris.The fires continued to burn until December of 2001. Our Department, carrying out its rescue, recovery, emergency medical care and fire suppression roles, maintained a continuous presence at the site until its closure in July 2002.Our rescue workers were the first in, the last out and the most exposed, working at the deepest levels. The need to evaluate and monitor the health effects of this exposure was evident early on. That is why the Bureau of Health Services, with the help of labor and management, developed this program, which began in October 2001,just weeks after 9/11. This report is an outgrowth of that work; although there are still many unanswered questions,it gives us the chance to share what we do know at this point in time. Some of the information gathered comes from comprehensive medical questionnaires, some from testing, some from FDNY retirement statistics and some from the FDNY's Counseling Services Unit. We also have included in this bookthe NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Clinical Guidelines for Adults Exposed to the WTC Disaster. Weask that you bring it to your personal doctor to assist in caring for your health. This report can only begin to address the question raised by many of our rescue workers: \"How are we doing\"? The information we gather from this program will help us answer this question, both now and in the future. We owe it toall our members to share all information we gather and analyze. We know that without the participation of our mem-bership, this program could never succeed. The need remains for long-term monitoring of both active and retired Firefighters and EMS members, not only to examine current medical issues, but also to look for any late-emerging symptoms or diseases that could occur in thefuture. We remain committed to providing evaluations and treatment for the physical and mental health consequencesof WTC exposure for our exposed members. Obtaining the resources to fully fund this program, provide these serv-ices and share this information have been and will continue to be among our top priorities. Be well, stay safe and continue to take care of yourselves and your families.

We lost 343 of our Brothers. We do not want to lose one more. Most of us--some for many months--served at theWTC site, the Fresh Kills landfill or the Medical Examiner's office. Although we cannot change the exposureswe experienced, we can improve our health through medical monitoring and treatment. Within a month of the 9/11 attacks, BHS initiated comprehensive medical screenings for FDNY members. We worked with BHS in designing the FDNY BHS World Trade Center Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program specifically for our mem-bers. Your periodic annual medical isthe World Trade Center medical for those Firefighters who were on the job on 9/11/01. Together--the City, FDNY, fellow unions--successfully advocated for fundsfrom the United States Congress for long-term medical and mental health monitoring and treatment. We urge all members exposed on 9/11 and in the aftermath to participate in the FDNY BHS World Trade Center Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program. The program has been expanded to include treatment for all WTC-related symptoms.The program includes diagnostic testing, outside counseling referrals and free medications for WTC-related conditions . BHS continues to schedule active and retired members for repeat, follow-up exams every 12 to 18 months. This book on the medical and mental health impacts of 9/11 provides valuable information and guidelines for every mem- ber, their families and their health care providers. We strongly recommend that you thoroughly review this important infor-mation. If you have questions after reading the book, please bring them to your health care providers. Take the enclosedWTC diagnosis and treatment guidelines to your personal physician. We are grateful to BHS for its insight, vision and dedication to protecting our members' health. Both unions continue to serve as active and voting members on the World Trade Center Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program SteeringCommittee. We look forward to our continued collaborative efforts. We thank our members for their honorable service.We wish you all the very best health--today, tomorrow and in the future. Sincerely, Stephen J. Cassidy John J. McDonnell UFA, Local 94 UFOA, Local 854 Stephen J. Cassidy John J. McDonnell 9Letter from EMS Unions Dear EMS Members: Your heroic actions on 9/11/01 and your dedication in the months that followed will never be forgotten. We also will never forget our two lost members. We thank you for making us proud. From the onset, we worked together with FDNY-BHS to design a medical examination specifically for our members. Together with the City, FDNY, UEP , UEMSO, SOA, AFSCME, AFL-CIO and our fellow unions, we were able to securefunds from the United States Congress to provide periodic comprehensive medical monitoring and treatment throughthe World Trade Center Medical Monitoring Program. Active members receive this comprehensive medical as part of their annual physical examination. Retirees have been and will continue to be contacted for follow-up WTC Medical Monitoring. This program provides valuable surveil-lance and resources for diagnostic testing, respiratory and mental health treatment and free medications for WTC- related conditions . This book sheds light on the medical and mental health impacts during the first five years since 9/11/01. Read it thoroughly. Share it with your health care providers. Inform the program administrators and your health care providerof any changes in your health status. Take the enclosed WTC diagnosis and treatment guidelines to your personalphysician. We urge all members who were exposed at the World Trade Center site to continue to participate in the WTC Medical Monitoring Program every 12 to 18 months. Both UEP and UEMSO continue to serve as active and voting memberson the World Trade Center Monitoring and Treatment Program Steering Committee. Supporting this program is oneof the most important things we can do to protect the health and safety of our members for the foreseeable future. Sincerely, Patrick Bahnken Thomas Eppinger Unit member at the September 11, 2006, World Trade Center Memorial Ceremony.SECTION 1 INTRODUCTION & TIME LINE Mission History of the FDNY WTC Program During the past five years, FDNY's World Trade Center Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program (FDNY-WTC-MMTP) has become a national model in termsof both providing services for Department members and developing comprehensive data on the effects of exposureto the WTC site. These objective data were an important part ofthe Mayor's WTC Health Panel's deliberations and recommen-dations released in February 2007. Through a series of chartsand graphs, our FDNY report presents the data we haveobtained. We hope this information is useful to all of our mem-bers, including non-WTC responders, in understanding theknown health effects of 9/11. Of course, this FDNY report pres-ents only aggregate data and contains no information aboutany individual member's health. In performing its medical mon-itoring and treatment roles, the FDNY-WTC-MMTP , as a top pri-ority, is preserving the confidentiality of members' personalhealth records and information. Section 1 of this report provides some background on the FDNY-WTC-MMTP (hereafter referred to as \"the FDNY WTCProgram\"). Section 2 presents aggregate data on the physicalhealth effects of exposures at the WTC on and after 9/11.Section 3 presents aggregate data on the mental health effectsof 9/11. Section 4 shows the effects of 9/11 on FDNY memberretirements and disability pensions collected. Sections 5 and 6provide a summary of efforts to date, a brief look at future plansand information about funding the FDNY's programs. The Appendices provide useful additional informationabout treatment centers, self-evaluation tips aboutyour potential need for treatment and a list of FDNYWTC publications. MISSION The current mission of the FDNY WTC Program is to evalu- ate and treat individual FDNY members, both active andretired, who worked at the WTC sites. The FDNY WTC Program develops plans for future monitoring and treatment needs byanalyzing patterns of illness and using this information toanswer central questions about the health effects of WTC expo-sure. Monitoring and treatment are an outgrowth and expan-sion of what the FDNY Bureau of Health Services (FDNY-BHS)does everyday--improving member health and wellness throughperiodic medical evaluations, preventive therapies, injury/illnessevaluations and treatment. HISTORY OF THE FDNY WTC PROGRAM One month after the attacks on the WTC, under the guid- ance of our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Kerry Kelly and Dr.David Prezant, FDNY-BHS began comprehensive medicalscreenings. Both doctors were caught in the collapse andunderstood the potential short- and long-term health impacts ofthe unique exposures experienced at the WTC sites by ourFDNY rescue workers (Firefighters and EMS members). FDNY-BHS co-designed this program specifically for FDNY members,partnering with the Uniformed Firefighters Association (UFA), theUniformed Fire Officers Association (UFOA), the InternationalAssociation of Fire Fighters (IAFF) and Uniformed EmergencyMedical Technicians and Paramedics (UEP), Uniformed EMSOfficers (UEMSO) and the Supervising Officers Association(SOA). The periodic medicals and treatment programs already in place for active members supplied the foundation for the FDNYWTC Program and enabled FDNY-BHS to institute the programrapidly. We are proud that our BHS physicians were the first toidentify and treat WTC-related illnesses and that the FDNY WTCProgram helped to inform other WTC medical programs,including those provided by the Mount Sinai Consortium's1 WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program for non- FDNY responders and the Bellevue Hospital WWorkersEnvironmental Health Center's Treatment Program. Recognizing the potential for long-term health consequences from the exposures experienced at the WTC site, the FDNY WTCProgram expanded its initial screening programs to includelong-term monitoring, disease surveillance for late-emergingproblems and treatment. Over time, the FDNY WTC Programalso included many scientific partners, including the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institute forOccupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the Mt. Sinai NY/NJWTC Health Consortium for non-FDNY responders, the BellevueHospital WTC Environmental Health Center, Montefiore MedicalCenter and Albert Einstein College of Medicine. As of December31, 2006, more than 14,200 FDNY WTC rescue workers havehad medical monitoring examinations and more than 8000have received follow-up monitoring exams. Outreach activitiescontinue in an effort to give monitoring examinations to all ofthe approximately 16,200 members with whom the FDNY WTCProgram has been in active contact. The FDNY WTC Program recently has expanded to provide WTC-related medications to active and retired members. Thevarious treatment options available in the program will be dis-cussed in greater detail later in this publication. Treatment pro-vided under the FDNY WTC Program includes services only forWTC-related conditions. For those who did not participate in theWTC rescue and recovery effort and are not eligible for thesefree medications, the FDNY WTC Program remains importantbecause it has allowed FDNY to provide increased monitoring,expanded treatment options, improved safety benefits and morerobust training programs to all members. FUNDING In October 2001, only four weeks after the attack, FDNY- BHS began performing standardized medical screenings onWTC rescue workers with funding provided by NYC and the FDNY. This was the first comprehensive post-WTC exposuremedical performed by any medical institution. In November2001, the CDC granted $4.8 million to the FDNY to help fundthis program from 2002 to 2004. This allowed the FDNY WTCProgram to include affected retirees, who previously would havebeen excluded from BHS monitoring and treatment. By February2002, FDNY-BHS had conducted screening medical examina-tions on nearly 10,000 FDNY rescue workers (Fire and EMS,active and retired). In July 2004, the FDNY received $25 million from CDC/NIOSH to expand its monitoring program for an addition-al five years (2004-2009). This funding pays for standardizedclinical exams, staffing, scheduling and follow-ups. With thisfunding, every \"annual\" or periodic medical evaluation mem-bers receive at the FDNY has been improved and expanded tobe a WTC periodic medical to include higher quality pulmonaryfunction tests and improved medical and mental health ques-tionnaires. It also supports an FDNY data management group toprovide quality assurance and data analysis, so that the FDNYWTC Program can plan for future needs and release its findingsto our members. This report, provided to every active FDNYmember and affected retiree, is one example of the data man-agement group's work. The FDNY WTC Program receives funding from the FDNY to provide most work-related treatment for our active members.Since 2005, certain specialized WTC treatments have been pro-vided by supplemental funding through a September 11thRecovery Grant from the American Red Cross (ARC) LibertyDisaster Relief Fund. For retirees, initial funding for WTC-relatedphysical health treatment (respiratory, etc.) came from this ARCgrant. For retirees and family members, funding for WTC-relat-ed mental health treatment has come from multiple sources, 1Hospitals in the Mount Sinai Consortium: Mount Sinai School of Medicine/I. J. Selikoff Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine Long Island World Trade Center Monitoring and Treatment Programs/Stony Brook Medical Center Center for the Biology of Natural Systems, Queens College University of Medicine & Dentistry of New Jersey/Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Environmental & Occupational HealthSciences Institute Bellevue Hospital Center/NYU School SAMSA recent(November 2006) influx of approximately $20 millionfrom the federal government (NIOSH) now is beingused to continue these medical and mental healthtreatment efforts. We anticipate that this funding willsupport the program for approximately 12 months. The FDNY continues its efforts to secure additional federal funding to provide members with continuedlong-term monitoring and expert treatment. Futurefederal funding is always contingent upon document-ed needs; therefore, member participation in theFDNY WTC Program is important. The FDNY and its unions have been major support- ers of this program. Every dollar we receive from thefederal government for the FDNY WTC Program isspent only on this program. Both the FireCommissioner and union leadership have been instru-mental in helping FDNY-BHS obtain funding for theFDNY WTC Program. City government also has played a crucial role. In September 2006, the WTC Health Panel was formedto make recommendations to ensure sufficient fundingof WTC health programs in the future. Its report,\"Addressing the Health Impacts of 9-11,\" and the sub-sequent testimony given by Mayor Bloomberg beforethe U.S. Senate, vigorously advocate federal fundingto fully support the FDNY WTC Program, the MountSinai Consortium's WTC Medical Monitoring andTreatment Program for non-FDNY responders and theBellevue Hospital WTC Environmental Health Center'sTreatment Program. 14WTC Attacks Tower 1 and 2 collapse Total job recall BHS sets up triage center on Broadway Tower 7 collapse BHS treats members for WTC symptoms & injuries CSU support groups begin, debriefing groups at site IAFF and NFFF assist FDNY-CSU CSU sets up units in StatenIsland and Fort Totten,Queens Dr. Kelly testifies before U.

They were presentduring and after the collapse, seeing first-hand how FDNY rescue workers suffered from eye and skin irritation, nasal drip/congestion,coughing, breathing difficulties and other respiratorysymptoms. The medical screening program developed byFDNY-BHS four weeks after 9/11 evaluated and moni-tored these symptoms in our first responders. Members had blood tests administered, including complete blood cell counts, chemistries, lipid profiles,heavy metal screening and urine analysis. The blood andurine samples from the first 321 FDNY rescue workerswere sent to the CDC's National Laboratory to test formore than 110 chemicals, including heavy metals, pol-yaromatic hydrocarbons, PCBs and dioxins. These testsshowed no clinically significant elevations and, therefore,bio-monitoring tests on the rest of our group (more than13,600 additional members) concentrated on certainhighly toxic heavy metals (lead, mercury and beryllium)and total PCBs. Testing found heavy metals to be withinnormal clinical limits for all of our members and totalPCBs to be within normal limits for nearly all. In a groupof approximately 50 Firefighters, PCB tests showed mildelevations. The initial post-9/11 medical evaluation also included a chest x-ray, pulmonary function testing, EKG, hearingevaluations and a physical by our Medical Officers. Ateach medical, FDNY rescue workers also participated inan educational presentation with a question/answer ses-sion that reviewed WTC-related physical and mental health challenges, stress recognition and coping strategies. To assess the long-term physiological and psychologi- cal impacts of 9/11 on rescue workers and their families,the WTC Program developed a series of self-administered,computerized questionnaires, in conjunction with periodicmedical interviewing and testing of active members andretirees. The initial questionnaire was conducted fromOctober 2001 to October 2002 and then was replacedwith an updated questionnaire that ran from October2002 until August 2005. The total number of membersresponding was 9953 in the first year and more than14,200 cumulatively as of December 31, 2006. In thefuture, we will strive to give monitoring examinations toall 16,200 members with whom we have been in contact. Responses have been analyzed for the October 2001 to August 2005 period. We are continuing to compilesimilar data from August 2005 to date, using newer ver-sions of the computerized questionnaire. We have had anunprecedented response that clearly reflects our mem-bers' recognition of the importance of the FDNY-WTCProgram and their active participation. We hope that ourmembers will continue to participate, as the informationwe gain helps us to deliver the health services that best fitour members' needs. The results of these questionnaires,as shown on the following pages, indicate that manyWTC-related symptoms and conditions (respiratory andmental health) are strongly tied to arrival time at the WTCsite.The information contained in Section 2 has been gathered from medical questionnaires taken byactive and retired FDNY members at the FDNYBureau of Health Services during medical monitor-ing evaluations administered post-WTC. ActiveFDNY members were asked to respond to thequestionnaire at their periodic company medical,which now includes the WTC medical.23SECTION 2 MEDICAL QUESTIONNAIRE TTrade CCenter HHealth IImpacts oon FFDNY RRescue WWorkersIn an effort to better understand the health effects of Ground Zero exposure on FDNY employees, we classified rescue workers into four groups, based on their estimated arrival times at the WTC site.1Arrival Group I 1858 FDNY rescue workers present at WTC onthe morning of 9/11/01 during thecollapse Arrival Group II 9435 FDNY rescue workers who first came tothe WTC site in the afternoon ofDay 1 or anytime on Day 2 Arrival Group III 2031 FDNY rescue workers who first came tothe WTC site on Day 3 or later Unexposed Group 187 FDNY rescue workers with no presence, atanytime, at the WTC site Ninety-nine percent of the group surveyed responded to the WTC. There was a job-wide recall that brought in active members. In addition, many retired members volunteered and that response continued for the weeks and months tocome. In the initial trauma of that day, our injured members were taken to local hospital centers (including locationsin New Jersey), most with significant orthopedic injuries and a few with severe respiratory injuries requiring mechani-cal ventilatory support. Members critically injured by falling debris required hospitalization and, for some, orthopedicsurgeries to recover. In the first 24 hours, 240 FDNY members were treated in emergency departments and 28 mem-bers were admitted to hospitals. Some members had respiratory difficulties that began that day, but for many others,respiratory symptoms surfaced in the days, weeks and months after 9/11/01. 1Data analysis collected from questionnaires completed by FDNY rescue workers Oct. 2001-Aug. 2005.ARRIVAL TIME AT WTC QUESTIONNAIRE DATA * A respirator is a specially fitted device worn over the mouth and/or nose that protects the respiratory system of the user. 2Data analysis collected from questionnaires completed by FDNY rescue workers Oct. 2001-Oct. 2002.Frequency of mask and/or respirator* use is a prominent factor considered when determining the severity of the exposure experienced by WTC rescue workers.2 When the towers collapsed, an enormous dust cloud with a high concentration of particulate matter consumed lower Manhattan. FDNY first responders constantly inhaled this thick air, a process made worse by strenuous workand open-mouth breathing. On Day 1, even those with self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) only had clean airfor about 15 minutes. After the SCBAs ran out of air and for the many who did not have an SCBA, there were fewrespirators available to rescue workers and those who used protection wore dust masks. N95 \"TB\" respirators are cor-rect for biological emergencies; however, dust, surgical masks and N95 \"TB\" respirators do not provide adequate res-piratory protection at a collapse/fire disaster site. The correct mask for this exposure (P-100 respirator) was not wide-ly available until after the first week. The intense environmental exposure is directly related to the respiratory symp-toms/illnesses described throughout this publication.Day 1 56% never wore a mask/respirator 23% rarely wore a mask/respirator 21% mostly wore a mask/respirator Day 2 47% never worn 23% rarely worn 30% mostly worn Weeks 2-4 12% never worn 19% rarely worn 69% mostly worn After Oct. 1, 2001 9% never worn 16% rarely worn 75% mostly wornMASK/RESPIRATOR USE 100 80604020 0 Day 1 Day 2 Wk. 2-4 After 10/1/01None Worn RarelyWorn FFDNY RRescue WWorkersThe number of rescue workers suffering from eye and skin irritation has decreased dramatically as time has progressed.3One Month Post-WTC 70% of rescue workers had eye irritation 30% had skin irritation One Year Post-WTC 47% had eye irritation 25% had skin irritation Years 2-4 Post-WTC 7% had eye irritation 4% had skin irritation Eye and skin irritations were likely to occur when exposed to the thick dust cloud, as evidenced by the high rates of these symptoms in the first months after 9/11/01. There has been a dramatic decline in the incidenceof both types of irritation in years 2-4. Currently, few continue to report eye and skin symptoms. 3Data analysis collected from questionnaires completed by FDNY rescue workers Oct. 2001-Aug. 2005. FDNYWTCRescueWorkers(%)Post-WTC mo. 1 Post-WTC 1Post-WTC yrs. 2-4 DATA 4Data analysis collected from questionnaires completed by FDNY rescue workers Oct. 2001-Oct. 2002.The incidence of respiratory symptoms in the first year after 9/11/01 is directly related to WTC arrival time.4 In total, more than 79 percent of those present during the morning of 9/11/01 had at least one lower respiratory symptom, with a large number demonstrating multiple symptoms. Our data show a strong connection between WTCexposure and respiratory ailments. These data clearly indicate that earlier arrival times (especially within the first 48hours) at WTC by FDNY members are associated with the highest incidence rate for respiratory symptoms. Other sci- entific groups have mirrored our results, showing a clear association between arrival time and loss of pulmonary function.Daily Cough 54% of Arrival Group I 47% of Arrival Group II 31% of Arrival Group III Shortness of Breath 38% of Arrival Group I 25% of Arrival Group II 14% of Arrival Group III Wheezing 27% of Arrival Group I 20% of Arrival Group II 12% of Arrival Group III Chest Pain 30% of Arrival Group I 20% of Arrival Group II 10% of Arrival Group III Any of these Symptoms 79% of Arrival Group I 69% of Arrival Group II 50% of Arrival Group III100 80604020 0 Daily Cough Short of Breath Wheeze Chest Pain Any Lower Respiratory SystemArrival TTime EExposure CCategory Group I=AM of 9/11/01 Group II=Next 36 hours (Day 1 PM & Day 2) Group III=After Day 2FDNYWTCRescueWorkers(%)RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS FOR DIFFERENT EXPOSURE GROUPS YEAR 1 Arrival Group I Arrival Group IIArrival Group III27SECTION 2 MEDICAL QUESTIONNAIRE IImpacts oon FFDNY RRescue WWorkersWith early diagnosis and treatment, the incidence rate of lower respiratory symptoms has declined significantly since 9/11/01, but these symptoms persist in many of our members.5Day 1 9/11/01 99% of FDNY rescue workers pres- ent were coughing 43% had shortness of breath 30% were wheezing 36% had chest pain Month 1 Post-WTC 53% had a daily cough 29% had shortness of breath 21% were wheezing 24% had chest pain Year 1 Post-WTC 46% had a daily cough 25% had shortness of breath 20% were wheezing 20% had chest pain Years 2-4 Post-WTC 31% had a daily cough 28% had shortness of breath 20% were wheezing 11% had chest painDay 1 exposure to clouds of dust and debris resulted in cough symptoms for 99% of those present at the WTC site. One month later, more than half of our rescue workers were still reporting a daily cough and 2-4 years later,31% were still struggling with this symptom. With early diagnosis and treatment, the incidence rate of this symptomimproved compared to Day 1, but is still significantly higher than before 9/11/01 when only 3% of FDNY rescueworkers reported a daily cough. Other lower respiratory symptoms have followed a similar evolution over time.These persistent symptoms, coupled with objective proof of pulmonary function declines (see page 29), are whyFDNY WTC rescue workers should continue to participate in the long-term monitoring and treatment programsoffered by the WTC Program. 5Data analysis collected from questionnaires completed by FDNY rescue workers Oct. 2001-Aug. 2005.LOWER RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS 100 80604020 0 Daily Cough Short of Breath Wheeze Chest PainFDNYWTCRescueWorkers(%)Pre-WTC DATA 6Data analysis collected from questionnaires completed by FDNY rescue workers Oct. 2001-Aug. 2005.Upper respiratory symptoms were the most common problems experienced by FDNY rescue workers, but these symptoms, while persistent in many, have also shown great improvement over time.6 Upper respiratory symptoms (cough, nasal/sinus congestion/drip, sore/hoarse throat) have all followed a similar evolution during the four years following 9/11/01. On Day 1, more than half of our work force experienced all ofthe above symptoms. One year later, more than half of our rescue workers were still reporting upper respiratory symp-toms and 2-4 years later, about 25% were still struggling with daily or frequent symptoms. Particulate matter analysishas shown a highly alkaline pH of WTC dust (like lye), which is extremely irritating to upper and lower airways.Day 1 9/11/01 99% of FDNY rescue workers present were coughing 80% had nasal congestion 63% had sore/hoarse throat Month 1 Post-WTC 53% had a daily cough 40% had frequent nasal congestion 54% had frequent sore throat Year 1 Post-WTC 46% had a daily cough 25% had frequent nasal congestion 46% had frequent sore throat Years 2-4 Post-WTC 31% had a daily cough 32% had frequent nasal congestion 22% had frequent sore throatUPPER RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS 100 80604020 0 Daily Cough Frequent mo. 1Post-WTC IImpacts oon FFDNY RRescue WWorkersAlthough loss of lung function can be linked directly to arrival time, all exposure groups experienced an unprecedented decline in lung function within the first 12 months following the WTC attacks.7Pre-WTC On average, FDNY rescue workers lose 31 milliliters (ml) of FEV1 eachyear (similar to US population aver-ages) Within the First Year Post-WTC Members in Arrival Group I lost 388 ml of FEV1 on average (more than12 times the average pre-WTCannual loss) Members in Arrival Group II lost372 ml of FEV1 on average (12times the average pre-WTC annualloss) Members in Arrival Group III lost357 ml of FEV1 on average (morethan 11 times the average pre-WTCannual loss)Since 1997, FDNY rescue workers have participated in a periodic medical evaluation (every 12 to 15 months) to track health problems and determine work eligibility. One part of the evaluation is a pulmonaryfunction test (PFT), which measures forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume after 1 second(FEV1). FVC is the total amount of air one can forcibly breathe out. FEV1 is the amount of air one can forciblybreathe out in the first second. As we grow older, both FVC and FEV1 decline naturally at an average rate of20-30 ml per year. In this graph, we see a connection between arrival time at the WTC and pulmonary func-tion loss, with members of Arrival Group I demonstrating a greater loss in FEV1 than members of ArrivalGroups II and III. Although the reduction in pulmonary function was greatest for those present during the col-lapse, FEV1 and FVC was decreased even in FDNY rescue workers arriving at later time periods. Similar find-ings were found for the FVC. Data obtained after September 2002 now are being analyzed and future FDNY-WTC monitoring will allow us to determine if this decline plateaus, improves or continues. For those withsymptoms, we believe that treatment is the best way to ensure appropriate diagnoses and improvement. 7Data analysis collected from PFTs by FDNY rescue workers EXPOSURE CATEGORY -388 -372-357-31 -31 -31 Arrival Group IArrival Group IIArrival Group III Arrival Time Exposure Category Group I = AM of 9/11/01; Group II = Next 36 hours (Day 1 PM & Day 2); Group III = After 8Data analysis collected from PFTs by FDNY rescue workers Jan. 1996-Sept. 2002.When we break down our rescue workers into two groups, Firefighters had a greater average decline in pulmonary function than EMS members, but both groups still had greater average declines than pre-9/11/01.8 The greater decline of FEV1 in Firefighters compared to EMS workers likely is due to the differing roles of each job in the rescue and recovery effort. Fire suppression and search activities kept the Firefighters closer to the burn-ing debris and pulverized rubble. Although EMS workers have lost less lung function than the Firefighters, on aver-age, they still showed a substantial decline in lung function, indicating WTC environmental site exposure. Thus, job-related tasks performed and perhaps proximity to the Ground Zero site played roles in the loss of lung function.Pre-WTC Entire FDNY rescue worker popula- tion loses 31 ml of FEV1 each year(near national average) First Year Post-WTC EMS employees lost 320 ml of FEV1 on average (more than 10 times theaverage pre-WTC annual loss) Firefighters lost 384 ml of FEV1 onaverage (more than 12 times theaverage pre-WTC annual loss) Firefighters had 20% greater declinein FEV1 than EMS employeesPULMONARY FUNCTION LOSS: FIRST YEAR AFTER 9/11/2001 BY WORK ASSIGNMENT (FIRE & 0 -50 -100-150-200-250-300-350-400-450-500 AdjustedFEV1Loss(ml)Pre-WTC Post-WTC-31 -31 (MCT) is a specialized, objective test used to confirm the diagnosis of asthma in symptomatic FDNY rescue workers who have normal pulmonary function.91 Month Post-WTC, in a random sample: 24.7% of highly exposed workers have Airway Hyperreactivity (AHR) 8% of moderately exposed 3.6% of unexposed control group 3 Month Post-WTC, in a random sample: 23.8% of highly exposed workers have AHR 6.8% of moderately exposed 3.6% of unexposed control group 6 Month Post-WTC, in a random sample: 27.6% of highly exposed workers have AHR 8.3% of moderately exposed 3.6% of unexposed control groupMethacholine is a chemical that when inhaled at increasing doses in a controlled setting, identifies who is likely to have asthmatic reactions. In susceptible subjects, this test can provoke an asthma attack (airway spasm). TheAmerican Thoracic Society defines significant airway hyperreactivity as FEV1 at low-dose metha-choline levels (<8mg methacholine). Airway hyperreactivity can be especially burdensome to Firefighters who, dueto the nature of their job, often are exposed to smoke, fumes or other irritants. Similar to our symptom and PFTdata, the methacholine challenge tests indicate a strong correlation with the earliest WTC arrival time. Before theWTC attacks, there was no history of asthma in our Firefighter work force. As shown in the above graph, these newonset cases in FDNY rescue workers were not just acute, temporary effects of exposure. Data we now are analyz-ing show long-term airway hyperreactivity persistence for 2 to 4 years among those initially affected. 9Data analysis collected from PFTs by FDNY rescue workers Oct. 2001-April 2002.

The causeis unclear, but sarcoidosis is associated with exposures to organic and chemical dusts, metals, silica and wood dustor smoke. Compared to population values, FDNY-BHS showed increased incidence of sarcoidosis in FDNYFirefighters during the 15 years pre-WTC, presumably due to smoke exposure. After 9/11/01, the number of newFDNY sarcoidosis cases increased dramatically, especially in the first year post-WTC. In contrast to pre-9/11, mostnew cases are symptomatic (69%) with shortness of breath, cough and other asthma-like symptoms. Because ourcases primarily involve the lung, it may be more accurate to classify them as WTC \"sarcoid-like\" granulomatouspulmonary disease (SLGPD). Other rare pulmonary diseases in FDNY rescue workers have included 2 witheosinophilic pneumonitis (occurring in 2002 and cured with early diagnosis and treatment) and 4 with pulmonaryfibrosis (1 fatality in 2004 and 1 who may need a lung transplant).15 Years Pre-WTC 0 to 5 FDNY rescue workers contract sarcoidosis annually, an averageincidence rate of 13/100,000.Most were asymptomatic 9/11/01-9/11/02 13 new cases develop in FDNY res- cue workers, an 86/100,000 annualincidence rate (or more than a 6-foldincrease from pre-WTC levels) 9/11/02-9/11/06 13 new cases of sarcoidosis develop in the next four years, an averageannual incidence rate of22/100,000 Asthma 69% of those diagnosed with sar- coidosis since 9/11/01 had newonset asthma Airway Hyperreactivity (AHR) 8 of 21 (38%) of sarcoidosis patients who take a challenge test 1210 86420NumberofPatients\"SARCOID-LIKE\" GRANULOMATOUS PNEUMONITIS FDNY: PRE- & 1993 1995 1997 1999 9/11/01-02 9/11/03-04 9/11/05-06SECTION 3 MENTAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT Mental Health Questionnaire Data FDNY WTC Survivors Closely Linked to Those Lost on 9/11/01 WTC-Related Health Concerns by Arrival Time WTC-Related Concerns About Early Mortality by Arrival Time Change in Sleep-Related Issues After WTC Change in Mood After WTC Feelings of Distance and Detachment After WTC Reliving and Remembering the WTC Experience Change in Exercise Program After WTC 34 FDNY members and trades personnel work at Ground Zero. HEALTH ASSESSMENT For more than 25 years, the FDNY Counseling Service Unit (FDNY-CSU) has been meeting the needs of theFDNY community. Prior to 9/11/01, it provided coun-seling for family issues, personal stress or when an FDNY member died. In response to the World Trade Centerattacks and the tragic loss of 343 members of our FDNY fam-ily from more than 60 firehouses and 2 EMS stations, wequickly adapted and expanded our programs, trained person-nel, visited every firehouse and EMS station and added coun-seling sites to provide emergent and extensive mental healthservices to members and their families, including the familiesof deceased rescue workers. The FDNY-CSU played a princi-pal role in the evaluation, treatment and monitoring of the psy-chological response to the 9/11 attacks. Because our CSUhad significant experience and understanding of our members,programs were developed to meet specific needs. Now, in thesixth year after this tragedy, our dedicated staff continues itsmission of caring for the mental health of our members (bothactive and retired) and their families. In addition, mental health questionnaires from the FDNY WTC Program helped to further identify mental health concerns andtrends. One of the goals of these questionnaires was to identifythe scope and severity of the psychological and physical damageresulting from the WTC terrorist attacks in an effort to providefocused interventions/treatments and monitor response rates. Theinformation collected is used not only to improve the quality ofcare provided by the FDNY-CSU and FDNY-BHS, but also toincrease our general understanding of mental health responses after major disasters. This is a critical issue for our members asthey are always among the first to respond to such disasters. Our initial questionnaire asked FDNY rescue workers about arrival time at the WTC and total time spent at WTC sites in themonths that followed. The mental health portion asked aboutemotional well-being through questions aimed at identifyingsymptoms and behavioral patterns related to stress, anxiety anddepression. It examined changes in the ability to function, bothin their personal and work lives, which may have occurred dueto psychological problems resulting from 9/11, such as anger,irritability and anxiety; memory and concentration problems;changes in eating, sleeping and exercise patterns; and increas-es in alcohol and tobacco usage. As we had not rigorously col-lected mental health information pre-9/11, we present theseself-reported data without comparison. The mental health questionnaire also collected data on the number of people utilizing our counseling services and the typesof counseling used. It should be noted that the members takingtheir medicals and responding to these questionnaires were, forthe most part, on full-duty, working in the field, but also includ-ed our light-duty members and affected retirees. Our findings after 9/11 show the persistent emotional impact left by this tragedy, with the greatest effects realized inFDNY rescue workers who either were at the WTC site during thecollapse or lost loved ones on 9/11. Section 3 of this report will discuss the psycholog- ical effects of working at the WTC site by examin-ing self-reported data from ASSESSMENT 1Data analysis collected from questionnaires completed by FDNY rescue workers Oct. 2001-Oct. 2002.The majority of FDNY members reported close ties to those lost at the WTC site.1 An overwhelming 98% of FDNY rescue workers knew at least one person who died at the WTC and many knew more than one person. In addition to being members of the FDNY extended family, the 343 rescue workers we lostthat tragic day held multiple, diverse roles as spouses, fianc\u00e9s, significant others, fathers, sons, brothers, friends andcoworkers. The close bonds formed between those members who sacrificed their lives and those who survived helpto explain the extent of our members' suffering in the aftermath of 9/11. Despite the loss of their loved ones, ourmembers dedicated themselves to continuing the search for the missing. Each anniversary, memories and unex-pected reports of new identifications can serve to rekindle these emotions.98% of FDNY rescue workers lost someone they knew on 9/11/01 68% lost FDNY close friends 52% 23% lost non-FDNY relatives andclose friendsFDNY WTC SURVIVORS CLOSELY LINKED TO THOSE LOST ON 9/11/01 100 80604020 0FDNYWTCRescueWorkers% Knew someone FDNY Relatives & Friends98 68 HHealth IImpacts oon FFDNY RRescue WWorkersEarly responders expressed the greatest health concerns after working at the WTC site.2 Year 1 Post-WTC All FDNY Rescue Workers 93% had WTC-related health concerns Arrival Group I 95% had health concerns Arrival Group II 94% had health concerns Arrival Group III 85% had health concerns WTC-related health concerns are seen in all response groups, regardless of arrival time. Clearly, those groups arriving on Day 1 or Day 2 had significant con-cerns about their health when faced with air quality issues. These groups also per-sonally witnessed the largest amount of injury, death and destruction. 2Data analysis collected from questionnaires completed by FDNY rescue workers Oct. 2001-Oct. 2002.FDNY Any Arrival TimeArrival Group I Arrival Group II Arrival Group III100 80604020 0WTC-RELATED HEALTH CONCERNS BY ARRIVAL TIME Arrival Time Exposure Category Group I = AM of 9/11/01; Group II = Next 36 hours (Day 1 PM & Day 2); Group III = After Day 2939594 85FDNYWTCRescueWorkers(%)Concerns about early mortality among FDNY rescue workers are strongly correlated to arrival time at WTC.3 WTC-RELATED CONCERNS ABOUT EARLY MORTALITY BY ARRIVAL TIME 100 80604020 0RescueWorkers(%) FDNY Any Arrival TimeArrival Group I Arrival Group II Arrival Group III Arrival Time Exposure Category Group I = AM of 9/11/01; Group II = Next 36 hours (Day 1 PM & Day 2); Group III = After Day 2223122 14 In the mental health questionnaire, 22% of FDNY rescue workers answered that they were \"feeling as if (their) future will be cut short\" by WTC exposures and relatedillnesses. These results are not surprising, as those members present before and dur-ing the collapse of the towers personally experienced the prospect of death, witnessedthe sudden loss of coworkers and inhaled the most dust. We know that regardless ofarrival time, all FDNY rescue workers suffered varying inhalation exposures and werein proximity to those who perished. Concerns about early mortality among our FDNYrescue workers are to be expected. As can be seen in the next group of figures, theseexposures and concerns translate into high rates for symptoms that are common ingrief reactions, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. Years 2-4 Post-WTC All FDNY Rescue Workers 22% had early mortality concerns Arrival Group I 31% had early mortality concerns Arrival Group II 22% had early mortality concerns Arrival Group III 14% had early mortality concerns 3Data analysis collected from questionnaires completed by FDNY rescue ASSESSMENT FDNY rescue workers self-reported numerous sleep issues in the first four years after working at the WTC site.4 Sleep disturbances were prominent in the first year after 9/11/01 and persisted in years 2 through 4. This could be related to changes in mood and anxiety after the WTC attacks, nightmares, the amount of time spentworking at the WTC or changes in exercise patterns. Our results indicate that although healing is occurring, thesesymptoms persist. 4Data analysis collected from questionnaires completed by FDNY rescue workers Oct. 2001-Aug. 2005.FDNYWTCRescueWorkers(%)Post-WTC yr. 1 Post-WTC 0CHANGE Post-WTC 61% rescue ers reported having sleep-relatedproblems 33% had trouble sleeping 46% had trouble getting a goodnight's sleep 27% had nightmares 14% had difficulty getting out of bed Years 2-4 Post-WTC 58% had sleep-related problems 34% had difficulty sleeping 39% had trouble getting a good night's sleep 22% had nightmares 13% had difficulty getting out of bed39SECTION 3 MENTAL HEALTH World TTrade CCenter HHealth IImpacts oon FFDNY RRescue WWorkersMood changes that occurred after working at the WTC have endured for more than 4 years.5 Self-reported persistent changes in concentration, irritability and anger are widespread, with more than half of our WTC-exposed work force exhibiting at least one of these symptoms. Again, this shows long-termpsychological effects from the WTC attacks and that continued attention to mental health is needed.Continued usage of counseling services at CSU indicates that this need remains strong 4 years later.

Feeling numb, distant or detached are frequent findings in those suffer-ing from PTSD, a psychiatric disorder that occurs after exposure to a terrifying event in which serious physical harmoccurred or was threatened (as in the case of the WTC attacks). PTSD may occur immediately or at a later timeand may persist. Effective treatment strategies involving social support, counseling and/or medications are avail-able at FDNY-CSU. It is unclear why some people are more prone to developing PTSD than others, but theprocess likely involves complex genetic, physical and social factors that are unique to each individual. 6Data analysis collected from questionnaires completed by FDNY rescue workers Oct. 2001-Aug. 2005.FDNYWTCRescueWorkers(%)Post-WTC yr. 1 Post-WTC yrs. 2-4 Any Psychological IssueFeel from OthersFeel Detached from Surroundings100 80604020 0FEELINGS OF DISTANCE AND DETACHMENT AFTER WTC 60 53 19 1020 20 2122 17 13Year 1 Post-WTC 60% of FDNY rescue workers report psychological issues (including re-experience issues) 19% felt numb 20% felt distant from friends or family 21% felt distant from others 17% felt detached from surroundings Years 2-4 Post-WTC 53% report psychological issues (including re-experience issues) 10% felt numb 20% felt distant from friends or family 22% felt distant from others 13% felt detached from surroundings41SECTION 3 MENTAL HEALTH workers report psychological issues (includingdetachment issues) 29% had flashbacks of WTC 15% avoided things or people asso-ciated with WTC 9% had difficulty remembering theWTC Years 2-4 Post-WTC 53% report psychological issues (including detachment issues) 29% had flashbacks of WTC 15% avoided things or people asso-ciated with WTC 15% had difficulty remembering theWTC 11% had physical reactions to WTCmemories 20% had guilt feelings about WTC 7Data analysis collected from questionnaires completed by FDNY rescue workers Oct. 2001-Aug. 2005.Nearly 30% of FDNY rescue workers continue to have flashbacks from the WTC experience.7 With nearly one in three FDNY WTC rescue workers still having flashbacks, clearly, there are still many resid- ual emotional reactions from that day. This, too, may be a sign of PTSD. Complicating matters, the stressful sit-uations encountered in the day-to-day rescue work that our members perform can trigger or exacerbate WTCmemories and stress reactions long after 9/11/01. Symptoms related to memories of 9/11 and flashbacks fromthe event continue to demonstrate persistent WTC-related grief reactions, PTSD and depression in our members.Guilt can take different forms; this includes guilt for those who were not present during the collapse and survivorguilt. In their struggle to hold on to those they lost, our members are clearly retaining painful memories. They arelearning how best to identify and manage the residual stress associated with the WTC memories, while holdingon to the need to \"never forget.\" FDNYWTCRescueWorkers(%)Post-WTC yr. 1 Post-WTC yrs. 2-4 Memories of WTCAvoiding WTC Things/PeopleDifficulty Remembering Reaction to WTC MemoriesGuilt Feelings about WTC100 80604020 0RELIVING AND REMEMBERING THE WTC EXPERIENCE 60 53 29 29 15 15 915 112042World TTrade CCenter HHealth ASSESSMENT 8Data analysis collected from questionnaires completed by FDNY rescue workers Oct. 2001-Aug. 2005.In the first year after 9/11/01, the majority of our members exercised less than they did before the WTC attacks. However, these trends are reversing for a variety of reasons.8 Given the physical demands of the job, we always expect to find most FDNY rescue workers engaged in an active lifestyle. As our members are aware, exercise provides an excellent outlet for stress reduction.However, in the first year following the WTC attacks, exercise routines were decreased in more than half ofthe FDNY rescue workers. This may have complicated the ability to handle stress. The increased activity levelbetween year 1 and years 2-4 reflects increased time available for exercise and, hopefully, the improvingstate of health (physical and mental) of our rescue workers.Year 1 Post-WTC 66% of FDNY rescue workers reported a change in exercise pro-gram post-WTC 37% exercised less due to lack oftime 23% exercised less because theydid not feel like it 5% exercised more Years 2-4 Post-WTC 46% reported no change in exer- cise compared to pre-WTC routine 13% exercised less due to lack oftime 15% exercised less because theydid not feel like it 18% exercised more FDNYWTCRescueWorkers(%)Post-WTC yr. 1 Post-WTC yrs. 2-4 Change in routine Decreased due to lack of timeDecreased because do not feel like itIncreased100 908070605040302010 0CHANGE IN EXERCISE PROGRAM AFTER WTC 66 46 37 1323 15 518SECTION 4 FDNY RETIREMENT ANDDISABILITY DATA FDNY Retirements and Years of Service Disability Pensions Received Number of Pulmonary Cases Under the Lung Bill Number of Permanent Psychological Impairment Cases Number of Cardiac Cases Under the Heart Bill Number of Cancer Cases NYCERS EMS \"3/4\" Disability Pension Applications Approved 44 343 flag-bearing FDNY members proudly march up 5th Avenue, passing the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the March 17, 2002, St. Patrick's Day Parade. The traumatic events of 9/11 affected both the physical and mental health of our members. Thisresulted in an unprecedented number of Firefighterretirements in the two years following 9/11, as wellas an increased number of disability pensionsgranted by the FDNY.FDNY RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY DATA In years pre-9/11 (9/11/99 to 9/10/01), there was an average of 544 annual Firefighter retirements. Inthe first two years post-WTC, 1216 and 1201Firefighters retired annually. In the next three years, the average number of retirees returned to pre-WTC val-ues and the work force now is younger with fewer mem-bers having 20 or more years of service. One third of thework force retired between 9/11/01 and 9/10/06. Thenumber of EMS retirements has not increased after9/11/01. Exposed retirees may represent the most severelyaffected of the more than 1500 Firefighters diagnosed with respiratory disease. From 2002-2006, 728 mem-bers qualified for permanent disability benefits under the\"Lung Bill.\" Many of those who retired were our seniorand most respected members. These figures also high-light the need to continue our outreach to FDNY retiredrescue workers to make certain they continue in our med-ical monitoring and treatment programs. Only with earlydiagnosis and treatment can we hope to reduce thepotential long-term impact of this exposure in later retire-ment years. In the 2 years following 9/11/01, there was an unprecedented number of FDNY Firefighter retirements. FDNY Retirements and Years of Service DATE EMS FIRE FIRE (>20 YRS.) FIRE (>20 YRS.)

Long before the WTC attacks, Firefighters have had to turn to the FDNY disabilitypension system when lung problems interfered with occupational demands. The provisions of the Lung Bill rec-ognize the hazards of firefighting, with its recurrent exposures despite protective gear and SCBA. This system pro-vides disability pensions only after a rigorous, objective evaluation of pulmonary function. The dramatic increasenoted above after 2001 is strongly tied to the WTC-related respiratory symptoms and loss of pulmonary functiondescribed previously. From 2002 to 2006, 728 members qualified for permanent disability benefits under theLung Bill.

This began in acknowledgement of the harrowing events experienced by FDNY-WTCFirefighters and Fire Officers, including the loss of friends and coworkers and personally witnessing vastamounts of death and destruction. From 2002 to 2006, 75 members qualified for permanent disabilitybenefits due to psychological impairment.

Members with other cardiac illness, such as cardiomyopathy and cardiac rhythm problems, currently do not fallunder the provisions of the Heart Bill. WTC monitoring will continue to evaluate members to look for patterns ofcardiac health after this exposure. At periodic medical evaluations, FDNY-BHS continues to stress efforts to mod-ify cardiac risk factors (obesity, sedentary lifestyles, elevated cholesterol levels, smoking, etc.). In 2002, there wasa spike in numbers, with a return to pre-WTC levels in 2003-2004. Members with known cardiac problems mayhave deferred retirement for one year to help with the rescue and recovery effort post-WTC. Numbers decreasedin 2005 and then increased in 2006. We continue to study this issue. 3Data analysis collected from FDNY Fire pension records.NUMBER OF CARDIAC CASES RECEIVING FDNY DISABILITY PENSION (\"3/4\") UNDER THE HEART BILL# oof CCases50 40302010 0 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Year23 2329 1235Pre-WTC Post-WTC 222039Pre-WTC An average of 25 FDNY and Fire Officers collect disabilitypensions for cardiac problemsannually Post-WTC An average of 26 FDNY Firefighters and Fire collect disabilitypensions 15 FDNY Firefighters and Fire Officers collect disabilitypensions due to cancer annually Post-WTC An average of 16 FDNY Firefighters and Fire Officers collect disabilitypensions due to cancer annually In 2006, there were an additional15 cases due to newly eligibleretirees under the WTC BillThe Cancer Bill (1994) is a pre- sumptive bill that was enacted inrecognition of Firefighters' daily occu-pational exposures to known carcino-gens. The WTC Bill (June 2005) is alsoa presumptive bill that was enacted inrecognition of WTC exposures andencompasses many ailments, includ-ing disabilities related to the lungs,upper respiratory system and cancer.The Cancer Bill is available only toactive members who have a disablingcancer. The WTC Bill is available toany active or retired FDNY memberwho was on active duty during the res-cue and recovery effort and thendeveloped a covered disabling condi-tion. In 2006, Firefighters first becameeligible for the WTC Bill. The number of members retiring due to cancer has been high for awork force this size, both pre- andpost-9/11/01, reflecting the exposuresto smoke and toxins consistently expe-rienced by our members. In 2006, there was a marked increase in the number of pensions granted due to cancer;however, this is the first year of broadened eligibility due to the WTC Bill and a significant portion of the increaseappears to be due to previously ineligible retirees who now are eligible. Of the 15 WTC Bill cancer pensions grant-ed in 2006, more than two-thirds were awarded to retired members seeking reclassification of their retirement sta-tus. Before 2006, these reclassifications were not possible and cancers among retirees were not tracked. Veryrecently, these data have become available to us (June 2007) and it is too soon to comment on patterns or typesof cancers. We are in the process of intensive investigation and will continue to obtain information from active mem-bers and retirees before finalizing our statistical analyses. A full report will be forthcoming in the near future. Cancer is a late-emerging disease that may take years or even decades to manifest in an individual, highlight- ing the need for FDNY rescue workers to continue in this monitoring program. This is especially true of our retiredmembers, who--until now--we have had no way to monitor following prior exposures. The federal funding provid-ed for the FDNY WTC Program has created the opportunity for retired members to continue their monitoring forlate-emerging diseases. This is the only way we can determine if cancer post-WTC has increased and the only wayto provide early diagnoses, which can improve outcomes. Also, for those few who smoke, we highly recommendparticipation in our free WTC Tobacco Cessation program to reduce future additional carcinogenic exposures. Inprior environmental/occupational disasters, the highest cancer rates have been in smokers.SECTION 4 FDNY RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY DATA 4Data analysis collected from FDNY Fire pension records.FDNY-BHS is closely monitoring late onset diseases, such as cancers, to look for emerging patterns post-WTC.4 NUMBER OF CANCER CASES RECEIVING FDNY DISABILITY PENSION (\"3/4\") # oof CCases35 3025201510 50 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006151615 1019 19 20WTC Bill--Retirees Cancer pensions through New York City Employees' Retirement System (NYCERS).

Priorto 2006, disability pensions from WTC-related injuries and illnesses were not distinguished from non-WTCcauses. Between 1/1/06 and 7/30/07, 9 EMS personnel were granted pensions under the WTC Bill.

WTC medical monitoring exams continue to be provided every 12-18 months to every active member (Fire and EMS) who served at any WTC site. This examis part of the regular periodic company medical. As of April 30, 2007, 10,415 incumbents had received an ini-tial monitoring exam and 8687 had received at least one follow-up monitoring exam (83% retention rate). Visit 3follow-up monitoring exams began October 5, 2006, and the number of members receiving these exams will rise.For the first time in FDNY history, we have included retirees in this post-exposure program. In the first six monthsafter 9/11/01, more than 1100 retirees participated in the WTC Monitoring and Treatment Program. As of April30, 2007, this has expanded to include 3904 retirees who have received an initial monitoring exam and 1898who have received at least one follow-up monitoring exam (49% retention rate). To improve our ability to sched-ule exams for retirees, we will be starting an intensive phone outreach campaign shortly after the sixth-year anniver-sary of the WTC attacks in September 2007. Participation in the monitoring program is a requirement to obtainfree treatment and medication.NUMBER OF MONITORING EXAMS CONDUCTED 16,000 14,00012,00010,000 8000600040002000 0 Visit 1 and 2 Base line Visit 2 Follow-Up Visit 3 Follow-Up*FDNY-WORLD TRADE CENTER MEDICAL MONITORING EXAMS POST-9/11/01 THIS PROGRAM INCLUDES FIRE AND EMS (ACTIVE AND RETIRED).

We were the first to describe the WTC Cough Syndrome and document that treatment was effective ( New England Journal of Medicine , 2002). Between 9/12/01 and 6/30/07, we have seen 6465 patients at a total of 40,313 visits. In December 2006,FDNY-BHS expanded monitoring and treatment services for WTC-related physical and respiratory illnesses. Our pri-mary care doctors have received specialized training and are available for initial treatment interventions. Referrals thencan be made to our two in-house lung specialists with 75 appointments available weekly. More appointments can beadded as needed. FDNY rescue workers at high exposure risk are offered chest CT imaging. Recognizing that treatment has been effective, but costly for members and their unions, NIOSH recently has fund- ed an FDNY no-cost prescription medication program for WTC-related conditions (respiratory, sinus, GERD, mentalhealth). Since medications have been provided, there has been an increase in treatment visits. All FDNY WTC rescueworkers (Fire and EMS, active and retired) who were at the WTC during the collapse/rescue/recovery effort (9/11/01to 7/02) and have received a WTC medical monitoring exam at FDNY-BHS (anytime since 8/12/05), qualify for thisprogram. Those meeting the above eligibility requirements already should have received instructions and a specialFDNY WTC Program prescription card. Eligibility and contact information can be verified or an updated WTC med-ical monitoring exam can be scheduled for you.

Because it is well-known that tobacco use results in an increased risk for the development of respiratory disease and cancer inasbestos workers, we felt it was prudent to offer our members a tobacco cessation program. \"Tobacco Free withFDNY\" is a free tobacco cessation program that provides counseling, nicotine replacement medication and othermedications when necessary. More than 600 members (active, retirees and family members) have participated inour program. We are proud to have some of the highest reported tobacco cessation rates in the nation. In a studyconducted on our first participants, 47%, 36% and 33% had stopped smoking for 3, 6 and 12 months, respec-tively. This program continues every Wednesday, alternating between FDNY-BHS and Fort Totten.

Only 15% of our rescue workers use tobacco, but post-WTC stress caused tobacco use to increase. \"I came to the program having failed in numerous attempts to quit smoking. I was a smoker many yearsbefore, but picked up the 'habit' on September 11,2001. I never thought I'd become a full-time smok-er as I never was one, but I guess the stress on thatday and the weeks and months that followed gaveme the excuse to keep smoking. Smoking definitelyeased the anxiety, which I always found counterintu-itive with nicotine being a stimulant, but I suppose bythen I was addicted and more of my anxiety wascoming from the withdrawal than from anything that9/11 may have been contributing. I didn't know itthen, but certainly know it now. Thanks for helping to save my life.\"Capt. Robert E. HigginsTobacco Cessation Program55SECTION 5 THE FDNY-WORLD TRADE CENTER MEDICAL MONITORING AND TREATMENT Unit (FDNY-CSU) consisted of 11 full-time coun-selors working at one location in Manhattan. This unit was responsible for counseling FDNY members on abroad range of issues, both personal and professional.FDNY-CSU also ran an outpatient substance abuse pro-gram and provided counseling during times of disaster,such as line-of-duty deaths (3 to 5 per year on average). When catastrophe struck on 9/11/01, we realized that rapid expansion was needed to provide assistanceto our members. Recognizing early on the need for anextensive network of counseling and support groups, weacted quickly by tapping into counselors from two part-ner organizations--the International Association of FireFighters (IAFF) and the National Fallen FirefightersFoundation (NFFF), who rushed to provide assistance.We established Debriefing Groups at the WTC site fromSeptember 11, 2001, through June 8, 2002, to supportand provide crisis counseling to those workers involvedin the recovery effort. Post-WTC Trauma Groups wereavailable, as needed, at FDNY-CSU locations. Weoffered extended counseling services at additionalFDNY-CSU offices located in members' communities. Two weeks following 9/11, FDNY-CSU units were established in Staten Island, Fort Totten (Queens) andlater in Suffolk and Orange Counties. For a list of CSUsite addresses and phone numbers, please refer to thepanel on the right. These sites provided individual coun-seling and support groups for FDNY workers and fami-lies, as well as the family members of the deceased. Wealso provided services conducted by FDNY-CSU clini-cians, trained outside mental health counselors andtrained peer counselors at FDNY work locations. Thefirehouses and EMS stations that were visited initially and provided with on-site counseling were those that had lostone or more of their members at the WTC site. Asstaffing increased, every work location was visited andcounseling was offered. The volume of members who sought help through the FDNY-CSU increased dramatically. From 9/11/01through 2006, the utilization patterns for the FDNY-CSUshowed a four- to five-fold increase. Pre-9/11, FDNY-CSU saw, on average, 50 new clients a month at its onesite, compared with more than 260 per month post-9/11. To date, this pattern of activity has continued. Annually, CSU continues to see nearly 3000 FDNY rescue workers (Fire and EMS, active and retired) andaffected family members. New programs introduced byFDNY-CSU recognize the changing and varied needs ofour members. These include the \"Stay Connected\" pro-gram for members and their families during transition toretirement. FDNY-CSU provides services for families of the deceased, including various specialized bereavementgroups for spouses, fianc\u00e9es, significant others, siblings,parents and children. CSU worked with BHS to establishtwo newsletters: The Link , which addressed the specific needs of FDNY families who lost a loved one, andHealth Connections , which focused on all of our FDNY members. Conferences and workshops were provided tofocus on stress management, PTSD, chemical dependen-cy, grief and bereavement and personal relationshipcommunication. Families of the deceased were offeredan array of services, including a Big Brother/Big Sisterprogram sponsored jointly by CSU and the UFA/UFOA.

Due to the nature of the job, FDNY members form tight-knit teams and typically were accus-tomed to self-management of problems or turning to their team members for advice prior to 9/11. CSU-trained peercounselors provide initial support and encourage members to seek professional counseling and treatment fromtrained mental health practitioners (social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists) at CSU or when needed throughother organizations. Referrals to private practitioners were made for those clients as needed or when preferred. Theincrease in use of FDNY-CSU counseling services after the first year post-9/11 reflects a greater acceptance by ourmembers of the need for more formal, structured counseling. The continued utilization of FDNY-CSU services in theyears that followed indicates that members continue to seek services as they recognize the need for effective treat-ments. Between 9/12/01 and 6/30/07, there have been 157,406 FDNY-CSU by 11,248 FDNY employeesand family members. Pre-9/11, there were only 600 visits per year to FDNY-CSU. Free mental health medications noware available for those members (Fire and EMS, active and retired) with WTC-related conditions and a recent FDNY-WTC Medical monitoring exam.ANNUAL NUMBER OF PATIENTS IN THE FDNY-CSU WTC MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT PROGRAMThis program includes Fire and EMS (active or retired) and affected family members.

This belief is sharedby Mayor Bloomberg and the members of hisWTC Health Panel, who have been strong advo-cates of federal resources to fully fund not onlythe FDNY WTC Program, but the Mount SinaiConsortium's WTC Medical Monitoring andTreatment Program for non-FDNY respondersand the Bellevue Hospital Environmental HealthCenter Treatment Program. This report has presented information on the health effects of 9/11, which confirms that theWTC exposure was unique and its effects are far-reaching and widespread among FDNY rescueworkers. It is clear that exposures of FDNY per-sonnel require a continued commitment to healthmonitoring and treatment. Thankfully, for many, time and treatment have allowed medical and psychological problems toresolve or diminish in severity since that fatefulday. Unfortunately, for others, illness persists.Some of these issues continue to present them-selves throughout our work force (Fire and EMS, active and retired). Pulmonary function testsdemonstrated an unprecedented decline in lungfunction in the year following September 11,2001. Follow-up studies are in progress to deter-mine the extent to which these declines have con-tinued. Given the nature of the job, respiratorysymptoms, such as shortness of breath, whichmay occur as a result of lung function loss, canimpair our members' ability to function at work.Similarly, PTSD, depression and anxiety cancause serious problems, both at work and home. The FDNY WTC Program has performed mon- itoring evaluations on more than 14,245 activeand retired FDNY rescue workers. Identifyingthese problems through regular monitoring eval-uations and providing treatment when needed,provide the best chance for preventing emphyse-ma and pulmonary fibrosis and fighting cancerand other late-emerging diseases. Treatment options can take different paths, including specialized procedures, such as chestCAT scans, cardiac stress tests and endoscopies.\"Tobacco Free with FDNY\" is a nationallyrenowned tobacco cessation program that canhelp those members who wish to \"kick the habit.\"We urge our members to take advantage of thisprogram. Although we did not find tobacco use \"It's a no-brainer. If you care about yourself and your family, this is a chance to see about yourcondition, to prevent a condition from worsen-ing or find out if anything has popped up.\" Capt. Bill Butler \"This is a good program; I highly recommend it to other retirees. The evaluation was very exten-sive, thorough. For retirees with concerns abouttheir future health, they should come down forthis medical evaluation for their piece of mindand for their families, too. There may beunknowns popping up or some problems mayshow accelerated rate, so it's important to knowwhat is going on. Everyone at BHS treated usprofessionally and in a caring with WTC-related declines in pulmonary function or with increases in sarcoid,it is well-known that smoking increases the futurerisk of developing cardiopulmonary diseasesand cancer. As of December 1, 2006, the FDNYWTC Program began to offer a free medicationprogram for WTC-related illnesses. We believethat this is an indispensable part of ourTreatment Program, as many of our membersand union security benefits funds (prescriptionplans) have been burdened financially by payingfor WTC medications. By offering medications atno cost, a barrier to care is removed so thathealth outcomes can be improved. We advise all members who worked at any of the WTC sites to remain active in the FDNYMonitoring and Treatment Program. Only withearly diagnosis and treatment can there beimprovement in health outcomes and demon-strated need for continued funding of this vitalprogram. Member participation does not beginand end with a visit to BHS; we will be periodi-cally contacting members for case managementfollow-ups and we urge members to contact us ifany new or additional medical or psychologicalissues arise. You are the best source of informa-tion about your own well-being and active par-ticipation in this program will help us continue towork as a team in maintaining your health. This report has presented the information and data that we have gathered during the past fiveyears. It is a reflection of how the FDNY hasresponded to meet the needs of our members. Itis clear that we continue to see members whoare still suffering from a variety of ailments thatcan be attributed to this event. It is also clear thatonly with long-term health monitoring and treat-ment will we learn how this exposure correlateswith the onset of serious long-term diseases,such as emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis andcancer. We wish to thank all those who served so self- lessly at the WTC on and after September 11,2001. The WTC Monitoring and TreatmentProgram has been a successful joint labor/man-agement initiative that has served as a model forNew York City. Health and fitness are of para-mount importance in fulfilling the mission of pro-tecting life and property in New York City. Ourshared goal continues to be to maximize thephysical and mental health of our work force,both now and in the future. Working together, wewill continue to make progress toward that goal.Our health is a gift that deserves our close atten-tion.

Cancer and heart disease are con-cerns for all Firefighters and many of us are concerned thatWTC exposures will have a further negative impact.Although none of us can take back our past exposures,there are many steps we can take to reduce our risk fordeveloping illness in the future. Wellness involves the health of the whole person. The body must be kept strong, fit and well-nourished, so it's able toresist disease and overcome injury. This is a team effort,combining mind, body and spirit. Wellness is more thanjust not being sick--it's a positive state of health. Wellnessmeans taking responsibility for your own health by: 1.Learn how to stay healthy \u00b7Have an annual medical examination. \u00b7Respond to your body's warning signs and visit your health-care provider--before something serioushappens. \u00b7Get an annual influenza vaccination. \u00b7Get a pneumococcal vaccination, especially rec- ommended for those with pulmonary disease. 2.Practice good health habits and give up harmful ones \u00b7Quit smoking now! Eliminate exposure to second- hand smoke. For help quitting, please call the FDNYTobacco Cessation Program at 718-999-1942. \u00b7Avoid alcohol abuse and drug use. \u00b7Avoid occupational or recreational exposures that are known to exacerbate illness. Always wear yourmask. \u00b7Get enough exercise. Adults need at least 30 min- utes of physical activity on most days of the week. \u00b7Practice safe sex with a loved one. \u00b7Eat right. Make smart choices from each food group every day. If you have gastroesophagealreflux disease (GERD), diet modification and weightcontrol are integral to the management of this dis-ease. Don't eat for 2 hours before lying down andavoid caffeine, carbonated beverages, chocolate, alcohol, spices, tomatoes and citrus fruits/juice. 3.Learn how to manage stress \u00b7Try to relax. Go to a movie, a ball game or partic- ipate in religious, social or other activities that maymake you feel better. \u00b7Improve your environment. Small changes around your home or office help you feel in control. \u00b7Plan your work to make efficient use of your time and energy. \u00b7Be realistic. Set practical goals for yourself. \u00b7Try to be with other people and confide in someone. It is usually better than being alone and secretive. \u00b7Seek professional help. Don't ignore symptoms of stress. Focus on your own wellness. You can be healthier, feel better, look better and live longer! In August 2006, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene released Clinical Guidelines forAdults Exposed to the World Trade Center Disaster. Dueto the fact that many New Yorkers have health problemsthat may be associated with WTC exposure, it is essentialthat primary care physicians know how to identify, evalu-ate, treat and possibly refer these individuals to special-ists. The publication suggests how clinicians can deter-mine a patient's exposure history and identifies manyhealth problems that may have been caused or madeworse by WTC exposure. It also offers algorithms to helpclinicians diagnose, treat and manage WTC-related con-ditions. The guidelines are included with this book. Youcan give them to your personal doctor if you so desire.Your doctor also can download them from the NYCDepartment of Health and Mental Hygiene website at: http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/chi/chi25-7.pdf.
