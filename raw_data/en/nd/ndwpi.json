But its effectiveness has not yet been widely realized/recognized over the world. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the clinical efficacy of TCM medicine in the treatment for COVID-19. We obtained the data of COVID-19 and traditional Chinese medicine from PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science and other databases, and searched from January 1, 2020 to January 26, 2022 to determine the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) without language restrictions. The review includes 26 randomized clinical trials including 2981 patients. The treatment of COVID-19 by TCM combined with conventional treatment is more effective than by pure conventional treatment in many aspects, including increasing of the effective rate [OR = 2.47, 95%CI (1.85, 3.30), P < 0.00001], fever disappearance rate [OR = 3.68, 95%CI (1.95, 6.96), P < 0.0001], fatigue disappearance rate [OR = 3.15, 95%CI (1.60, 6.21), P = 0.0009], cough disappearance rate = 2.89, 95%CI (1.84, 4.54), (1.98, 17.84), = 0.001], disappearance rate of shortness of breath [OR = 2.57, 95%CI (1.13, 5.80), P = 0.02], improvement rate of CT image [OR = 2.43, 95%CI (1.86, 3.16), P < 0.00001], and reduction of the hospitalization time [MD = -3.16, 95%CI (-3.75, -2.56), 95%CI (0.29, 0.83), P = 0.007]. The findings of this meta-analysis suggest that TCM can effectively relieve symptoms, boosted patients' recovery, cut the rate of patients developing into severe conditions, and reduce the deterioration rate.
