Even if your diet is exemplary, a seasonal cleanse is beneficial to remove toxins from the body and give your organ systems a chance to reset. I offer a self-paced Ten Day Reset that hundreds of my clients have participated in over the last 10 years. I recommend this cleanse program 2-3 times a year at minimum as the seasons change to re-establish mindful eating and lifestyle practices, shed unhealthy habits and re-connect to your most vibrant state of being. The Ten Day Reset is a whole-foods, plant-centric, mindfulness program that is rooted in the belief that food is medicine.

Everyone can benefit from a seasonal reset. If you've never done a cleanse, if it's been more than 12 months, or if you are transitioning off of hormonal birth control, medication or preparing for conception, a gentle cleanse may be just what you need. If you experience any of the following symptoms you know its time: digestive issues, bloating, fatigue, fogginess, PMS, migraines, joint pain, moodiness, skin issues, acne Can I do this cleanse if I am pregnant or breast feeding? I do not recommend any type of cleansing while pregnant or when breastfeeding. However, I'd be happy to create a customized nutritional program for you, including food, supplementation and an essential oil protocol. I'm brand new, which one should I pick?
