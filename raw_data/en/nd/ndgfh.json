JANE M. BARNES HOUSE MEMBERS: WILLIAM c. HENRY Jeffrey Mays JOHN T. O\u00b7CONNELL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR: RONALD EWERT This report presents our findings pursuant to House Resolution 776, adopted by the Illinois House of Representatives on April 26, 1978. The Child Victim: Child Abuse in the Family and', Society is the final report f'n a trilogy issued by the Illinois Legislative Investigating Commission which deals with various forms of child abuse; the two previous reports are entitled Sexual Exploitation of Children and Child Molestation: The Criminal Justice System. House Resolution 776 directed this Co~nission to examine the responsibilities, activities; and records of all agencies that deal with the child abuse problem and to determine how a coordinated effort c.ould be developed to detect and reduce the incide'nce of child abuse in. this State. . In fulfilling the mandate of this resolution, we conducted an investigation that was both lengthy and detailed. During its course, our investigative parameters' evolved continually, for two major reasons 0\" First, the systems 'we examined were changing almost constantly. The Department of, Children and FamilY'Services, the agency legally responsible for the identification, investigation and treatment of child,. abuse and neglect, underwent changes in its 'directorship, changes in the laws shaping its powers and duties (for example, the major 1980 amendm~nts to the Abused and Neg.lected Child Reporting Act), and changes ,in its internal rules and regulations. Second, as our investigation progressed, we beg?1n to realize that'the current focus o'f efforts directed toward ths problem of child abuse and neglect must change drastically ?it some point. Efforts expended on treating abuse and neglect after the fact are not only a poor use of public funds, but also ultimately self\u00ad defeating. Primary' prevention eventually must be given the same priori ty as treatment,. , . \\, This realization led us to agree Wl. th many experts who bel.:i.eve that legislation will not solvee the intractable problem of child abuse and heglecb~ Rather than being an answer in and of itself, legislation i.s a framework that'should allow for the ,development of. feasible .,solutions. -ix-. ~ ... We believe that the existing framework is basically sound. While we propose numerous recommendations in the chapter concluding this report, only eight entail statutory revision. We feel that all eight legislative recommendations are worthy of approval and would be of valuable assistance in our State's continuing effort to combat child abus\\9 and neglect, but one is of special importance and merits mention here. We have concluded that the Department of Children and Family Services is the most appropriate agency to receive an.d investigate reports of suspected child abuse and neglect, contrary to the contentions of critics who advocate the use of other agencies, such as law enforcement departments. During our investigation, we have seen improvement in the Department's ability to perform these functions. Unfortunately, what we also have seen--and documented-\u00adis the Department's failure to develop essential cooperation with other agencies and professions. Lack of coordination has resulted in the duplication and fragmentation of efforts and .services. The enactment of our major legislative recommendation, which would require the implementation of multidisciplinary child protection teams throughout Illinois, should help to remedy this inefficiency. In addition to our chapters on the Department of Children and Family Services, agencies that contract with the Department for the provision of services, legal issues related to the problem of child abuse and neglect, and multidisciplinary child protection teams, we have devoted three separate chapters to case studies. These chapters deal, respectively, with actual cases of (1) child abuse and neglect not ending in death, (2) child abuse and neglect resulting in the child's death, and (3) intrafamilial child sexual abuf~ (incest). We chose these cases from among the many we exa~~..;ned because they most fairly reveal the strengths and weak\u00ad nesses of Illinois' complex child protection system. These cases also illustrate many of the problems faced by child protection professionals. As a legislative commission mandated by the Generdl Assembly to investigate this area, we were able to gain access, although sometimes with difficulty, to otherwise confidential and privileged information. The reader should note that in the majority of case studies, the names of victims and others have been changed to protect their identities. Cnly when case's presented in this report have received wide coverage in the media., or when convictions for crimes described therein were obtained, are real names usually supplied.' Just as we have described only \"t:he most illustrative cases from the many on file, we have discussed only the most informative documents from the extensive body of child abuse literature. (The bibliography, however, lists all of the sources reviewed during this investigation.) The information and analysis finally chosen for inclusion in this voluminous report is that which we consider most -valuable to the members, of the General Assembly. -x-I ij I I Respectfully can be exemplified by my recollections of being forced to kneel upright, with piles of books in our outstr~tched arms for hours, of being made to !'shove out\" (to maintain a posture as if we were sitting on a chair, without a chair to support us) and to \"eat a square meal\" (to face straight ahead, without looking down at your plates) while eating. For years we were lined up and spanked with a stick before school in the, morning and again when our father returned horne in the evening. Sometimes we were put in a cold shower in the middle of the ni~ht if our parents went out for the evening. If one of us wa.s told to sweep the driveway, we would be spanked with a stick for each leaf our father discovered when he inspected the job. The second type of abuse that I distinguish was that of unpre\u00ad dictable outbursts of rage. I recall incidents such as the time our father dumped over a fully-set kitchen table because our mother had served two starches with dinner. There was also the time he nailed me to the wall by my braid for laughing too loudly. Allowing a door to slam, dropping a utensil at dinner, being too slow, using the \"wrong\" tone of voice, failing to maintain eye contact, not standing up straight enough, and laughing too loudly were all likely to incur severe beatings. We were slapped and spanked with a stick daily and every few months received injuries that required medical attention. Verbal abuse was incessant. We were constantly demeaned and insulted, told how stupid and unloveable we were and threatened with murder and, torture. Sometimes our parents threatened to abandon us. Occasionally, our father threatened to commit suicide because we were such a burden. We just kept trying to be perfect and to minimize our demands so that they wouldlo'lre us. (! JessicaCameronchild !JAn Autobiography of Violence,\" Child ~use The International Journal (Volume 2, 1978, pp. 139-49). -xii-, \\ I j Chapter 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND TO ~HE PROBLEM In April of 1978, the Chicago Police Department released in\u00ad formation that there had been an alarming increase in child murder. The total 'number of child murders for both 1976 and 1977 combined was 13. By the end of March, 1978, ten such murders had beenre\u00ad ported in Chicago alone. In a Chicago Tr'ibune story dated April 23J 1978, Representa\u00ad tive Aaron Jaffe was q~oted as saying, \"I can't believe that only black people on the South Side murder their children. Suburban crime must also be there, qut it is evidently not being reported.\" He also announced his inten'tion to introduce a House Resolution to'address the problem of child abuse and child abuse ending in death. (. House Resolution (HR) 776 passed on April 26, 1978, with 43 co-sponsors listed on the resolution. We have already referred to specific clauses of the resolution. It was drafted with the inten\u00ad tion that the Commission be able to investigate any facet of the child care system that could benefit from legislative or other recommendations. In March of 1977, the Commission had been mandated by House Resolution 41 to investigate several allegations concerning child porilography operations in the Chicago area and the apparent :r::.ise in child prostitution. We quickly discovered some overlap between these two investi\u00ad gations. Both required that weexarnine the child welfare and child protective services delivered by t;he Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS). Many victims of child pornographers and many child prostitutes were, or had been, wards of the state and in the guardianship of DCFS.' In April of 1979, House Resolution 138 passed, mandating the Commission to fully investigate the molestation of children by adults. Though this investigation was to prove more comparable tp our investigatiop of child pornog:r:'aphy and child prostitution, it too involved some facets of the entire child welfare system. We have issued comprehensive reports to the General Assembly based on HR 138 and HR 41. As a result, and as we will mention later, changes in law have been enacted. We concluded our investi\u00ad gation irito child abuse murder and related matters late in 1981. The investigation\" was lengthy because it involved necessary com\u00ad parisons of data, interviews'~ statistics, and programs both across td.me and acros's, space. We compared cllild abu,se statistics and pro'\u00ad grams in Illinois between. 1975 a~p 1981. W~ also sent investiga\u00ad tors to several other states to examine their systems to prevent, detect, investigate, and treat child abuse. . -1-- ------~~-~-- ----- In order to understand the problems facing the Illinois sys\u00ad tem, we conducted hundreds of interviews and reviewed hundreds of books and periodicals that discuss the various stag'es and types of child abuse. We also examined a number of individual case studies so that we could determine just where the state system had failed and where it had succeeded. These case studies were not developed scientifically or ran\u00ad domly. In some cases, we solicited and used case studies furnished us by DCFS staff. In some cases, we took media accounts of abuse and examined the roles of all concerned parties in the investiga\u00ad tion and disposition of the cases. And in still other cases, we asked to review DCFS case files from which we chose several inter- esting cases. The reader should be aware that many abuse cases investigated by DCFS have happy endings. Many are handled exactly as they are supposed to be handled. It was not our intention to highlight , DCFS successes, or to highlight DCFS failures, either. Rather, J,t was our mandate to determine what goes wrong with the system when it does fail. Our examination of individual cases and DCFS staff was designed to determine what systemic problems exist in the de\u00ad partment and how they might be solved. We have compared \"good\" cases with those handled poorly, so we do have a sense of perspec\u00adtive. But our interviews with individuals of all components of the child protective system also have provided us with a sense of how a case may fail, or what a case might have needed for it to succeed. Success or failure in child abuse cases is also difficult to measure. Many cases may seem to be IIgoodll cases, that is, cases in which everyone does his job. But some of those cases ptill re\u00adsult in the death of children. Other cases that might be considered \"bad\" may present a tangled web of poorly conceived plans by C?hilcl protective workers. Some of these cases turn out perfectly f~ne.,: :\", A case can \"go badll at any of literally dozens of places. Assess.',~ ina blame is a difficult job. We have limited our investigation of ca~es in such away that we can present as many facts surrounding the cases as is possible. We have drawn conclusions about these cases, but the reader is i:nvited to draw his own conclusions based on the information presented in this report. During the course of our investigation, internal procedures in DCFS changed radically. We fo:un.d that such change is common to DCFS. These changes necessitated our reinterviewin~ pers?nnel f~om different divisions within DCFS. We also had to re~nterv~ew off~\u00ad cials from other components of the child pxotective system. In some cases, we were unable to ,reinterview everyone whose role may have cl;la,nged. This report by necessity reflects the chang:i-ng na\u00ad ture of child protective services. We will share our conclusions, as well as our confusions, with the reader. We have found that child abuse is a very difficult. subject for people to deal with. We found in our interviews that many would prefer to pretend that child abuse is something that happens to -2-~, ;' '\" ., , I other ~eople, or,other types of people. Child abuse ending in death 2S almost 2ncomprehensible to many citizens. And it is al\u00ad most equally diffiC?ul~ for child abuse workers to handle. As we shall see, the Ill2n02s child. abuse \"system\" contains several un\u00ad related, generally uncoordinated eff~rts on the part of many people Many cases simpl~ fall through the cracks between these efforts. Other cases are 2gnored., Some cases are mishandled. Clearly, the state,needs a more organ2zed response to child abuse and we found that 2n some ways it is moving in the right directio~. , T~e ~used and Neglected Child Reporting Act of 1980 requiring 2nvest2gat20ns of abuse and neglect cases to be initiated within 24 hours of,a report has ge~erated controversial opinions and results. Some cla2m that the law 2S too rigid and that its requirements can never be met. We ,will examine this Act in detail later. The relationship between DCFS and many oth~r agencies, indi\u00ad viduals, and even the abusive parents themselves has been studied during' our investigation. We will recount our conclusions about this subject in detail later. ~e report7d that this investigation was mandated by a tremen\u00ad dous 2ncrease .~n reports of child abuse deaths in the early months of,1978., Unfortunately, the incidence of child abuse death has re\u00ad ma~ned h2gh. An article published in the Chicago Sun-Times dated Janua:y 12, ~982, m7ntions that there had been three fatal beatings of ch2ldren 2n an e2ght-day period. Some say that child abuse appears to be on the rise because of an increase in reports. Others counter that reports have risen be\u00ad cause of laws mandating such reports and because many citizens are aware that they can and should report. But the incidence of child abuse re,sul ting in death is not a statistic that can be challenged. And, unl~ke many cases of abuse, one cannot hide the death of a child--at least not for long~ . A. Defining Child Abuse Upon first thought, child abuse seems to be an obvious cate\u00ad gory of injury. It is not as simple as it seems. Child abuse has even been defined differently in many state statutes. And there have developed subdivisions of child abuse that are considered to\u00ad getqer,with it, including child neglect, emotional abuse, and even educat20nal abuse. All of these terms,and others, are part of the everyday parlance of the child welfare, and child protective worker. ~hese terms are also commonplace in juvenile courts and among per\u00ad sonnel of many agencies that must deal with child abuse almost every day. This section of our report will present definitions as well as some sense of perspective concerning the place of child abuse in society and in the home. -3-;~ I One basic text is titled Defining Child Abuse. Its authors, Jeanne M. Giovannoni and Rosina M. Becerra, both teach in the School of Social Welfare at UCLA. One primary question they address is how law should define child abuse. They state that there is a great deal of disagreement concerning the specificity of child abuse terminology in statute. Broad language generally seems to have been written to allow judges wide discretion in determining if a case indeed is one of child abuse. They agree that usually only an obvious case of abuse would travel all the way to a judge in a courtroom. This poses the problem that some people may be hesitant to report a case that seems \"marginal,\" and that prosecutors may be hesitant to bring such a case to court. The authors state: \"Yet all .available evidence indicates that the more narrowly defined 'physical injury' constitutes only a small fraction of the kinds of situations that make up the bulk of pub\u00ad lic child protection efforts.\" The authors also cite a study conducted in 1977 in which so~ cial workers, police, judges, and hospital pers~nne~ w~re agreed with the follo~ing statement: ::It 7s d1f~1cult to say what is and what is not ch11d maltreatment. F1ftY-S1X percent of the social workers and 64% of the police agreed with the statement, and the percentages for the judges and hospital personnel were even higher. One of the main considerations for all involved in determining the outcome of child abuse cases is the effects a charge of child I l I I i , abuse will have on the family. Sometimes, as we shall see, the , ! decision to keep a family intact--a societal decision, not an inter- i personal need--will determine the fate of an abused or sexually ;tiJ ~ molested child. The authors address this problem: \"At the heart i of the controversies over what should and should not be consid.eJ:\"ed 'II mistreatment warranting state intrusion into family life is cOIl I';, cern that such intrusion may simplY constitute the imposition c~f the values of one segment of the community on other segments with d,if- ferent values.\" All parts of the child abuse system feel the need to keep the family intact if at all possible, for the sake of the child as well as the parent. But our society is ~o J?lu:alistic that we fear judging one another's standards of d1sc1p11ne and conduct. The result is the hesitancy referred to above. Two quotations from Defining Child Abuse are useful to further understand this phenomenon: Child abuse education programs would do well to emphasize not so much the bizarre, extreme\"situations but the borderline 'types of mistreatment, the bruises and welts that come from \".normal\" hitting, the threshold of c~ild abuse. Clearly what is reflected in the data is a general acceptance of corporal punishment in this country. Since hitting children is acceptable, the demarcation of \"normal punishment\" and \"child abuse\" becomes a matter of the degree of physical in\u00ad jurY'inflicted. -4-The issue of corporal punishment will surface several times in this report. There is disagreement among experts about its effects on children in the home. Even its origin and purpose are disputed. B. Family Violence Another source our staff examined is \"The Social Causes of Interpersonal Violence: The Example of Family Violence and Odyssey House Non-Violence\" by Murray A. straus of the University of New Hampshire. Straus presented the paper at a meeting of the American Psychological Association in August, 1978. Though the focus of the paper is on a specific program that treats violence in the home, we can extrapolate some of Straus' comments about corporal punishment and-Tts role in Aruerican society. Straus stresses that we learn violence in this country from infancy. These violent lessons remain with us throughout our lives, according to Straus. We apply the violence we learn in the home to our lives outside the home, though in \"modified\" form. He mentions that violence is much more prevalent in the home than outside of it because we learn to socialize ourselves among outsiders. Straus cites a study that shows a much higher incidence of fighting within the home tha.n outside among high school seniors. Straus also says the following: The basic training'! in violence provided by the family fits a social learning theory model. It takes place through physical punishment, by observing violence, and by generalizing from the rules that are implicit in the way others react to acts of vio\u00ad lence. In general, the rule in the family is that if someone is doing wrong, and \"won't listen to reason,\" it is o.k. to hit. In the case of children, it is more than just o.k. The norms within the family are far more accepting of physical violence than are the rules governing behavior outside the family. Straus' voice is not alone: many researchers and other ex\u00ad perts in the child welfare field have studied the issue of violence in society in an attempt to understand violence within the home. Gerald A. Foster, D.S.W., presents his views in an article titled \"The Politics of Juvenile Justice.\" Foster mentions the United States Supreme Court decision of Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651 (1977).. Foster states: We should quickly dispel the myth that we live in a child and youth oriented society. It can be said that society as a whole has failed today's youth and failed them in such a way as to alienate them and character\u00ad izel ! them as scapegoats for the many shortcomings o\u00a3 a modern so\u00ad cial order which fin\u00a2is its ethical and moral foundations rapidly eroding. -5---~-~----- ~---~~ The relationship between the schools and society in general differs little from relationships in the different homes across this country. The social norm seems to be that chi.ldren can and should be punished physically. That many parents go to extremes in their punishments at horne is the issue that we are addressing in this report. Richard J. Gelles, Ph.D .. , presented a paper titled IVA Profile of Violence Towards Children in the United States\" at the Annenberg School of Communications Conference on Child Abuse in Pennsylvania on November 21, 1979. The paper makes a number of points that. add. to our discussion. The first is that violence in the horne is a single issue, re\u00ad gardless whether the violence is wife abuse, child abuse, or simply children beating up their brothers and sisters. The research being conducted into family violence stresses the term \"family\" much more than it did in the past.. In the past, child abuse was studied in isolation. NOw, child abuse is studied with increasing frequency as a part of a larger picture of general violent tendencies. It is these tendencies to which Gelles refers. Gelles agrees that the tendency has been to broaden the defi\u00ad nition of child abuse, and that abuse statistics vary because of varying definitions. He states in his paper tha~ e~timates of. child abuse nationwide ran from 30,000 a year to 1.5 mllllon, and Chlld abuse deaths estimates range from 365 a year to 5,000. Gelles' research also indicates that younger children, ages 3-5, are most vulnerable to physical abuse and that older children~ ages 15-17, are most likely to face \"extreme forms\" of violenc~. He also found that the Midwest has the highest rate of,I\"l7io\u00ad lence towards children. Apparently this conclusion is base.J on a number of factors, not the least of which is most ]1idweste:!'ners' favorable attitudes toward corporal punishment in the schools. He also found that city-~wellers have a higher abuse rate than rurql citizens and that abuse is unrelated to religion. The vast majority of abusers are 30 years old or younger; the older a parent, the lower the potential for abuse. There is no significant dif\u00ad ference among the races regarding frequency of abuse. Parents with lower incomes have a high rate of abuse, but, strangely, parents with a mid-range of education have the highest rates of abuse. Gelles defines these people as high school graduaFes. College graduates and those who never finish eighth grade hav7 significantly lower abuse rates. Blue collar workers have a much hlgher rate of abuse than white collar workers. Unemployed people have high rates of abuse and the overall abuse statistics go up dur.ing periods of greater ~nemployrnent. Also, the more overall stress that a family undergoes, the greater the potent.i,al for abuse. Gelles' work has led him to conclude that families in which decision making is shared between husband and wife have a lower incidence of abuse towards their 'children. The highest rates of -6-1 , 1 .; I~i abuse occur among parents ~lho a.re married less than ten years, have been abused as children themselves, do not Participate in activi\u00ad ties outside of the home, and have two or more children. There are other characteristics that can help identify the potentially abusive parent which we will mention throughout this report. Vincent J. Fontana and Douglas J. Besharov's book The Maltreated Child: The Maltreatment Syndrome in Children--A Medical, Legal, and Social Guide also addresses the problem of defining abuse. The authors point out that neglect can be, and has b7en, as pc:>tent.ially dangerous as physical abuse and for that reason lS often lncluded in most states' statutes as a single crime or category. C. Historical Overview of the Child Abuse Problem Commission staff have attempted to trace the historical origins of child abuse. Such a task is not simple. Our conclusion is that child abuse has probably always existed. It has changed primarily in its societal sanctions. An article by Brian G. Fraser titled \"The Child and His Parents: A Delicate Balance of Rights\" addresses the issue of the origins of child abuse. Most early societies felt that children were not people but possessions and were treated as. such. They were subjected to ritual sacrifice, exposure, ~utilatlon, abandonment, and exploitation. Many of these lat~er pract7ces ended in death. The primary reasons advanced for behavlor of thlS sort were early forms of birth control, religious beltefs, and \"treat\u00ad ment\" of deformed children. Frase~ cites the Hammurabi Code of 2150 B.C., in which a father had to \"accept\" a child into the family before that child received the status of being a person. Any rea\u00ad son the father had to reject a child resulted in infanticide. Once a child was accepted into the family, though, ~oth child an~ par-. ents had certain expectations of them. The Chlld had certaln dutles and the parents had to provide minimum care and feeding. In ancient Greece the father determined any newborn's fate. On the fifth day after birth, in a ceremony called the amphidromia, the father decided whether his child should be given a soul. If he decided negatiVely, the child was abandoned.to die of :xposure. Similarly, under early Roman law, the doctrlne of patrla aotestas was upheld, under which a father had the power of life.an dea~h over his children until adulthood. The father could kl11, mutl\u00ad late, or sell his children. Roman law changed to prohibit in\u00adfanticideuntil the child was three and then finally abolished in\u00ad fanticide altogether, but the child always could be sold into slavery. Fraser cites the Visigothic Code (476-711 A.D.) as the begin\u00ad ning of attempts to protect children. Rights and duties of children became as one under the Code, thereby giving children status in society. Infanticide was a serious offense punishable by blinding -7-~--- ~ -~-----'-----\"\"\"_i-\u00b7 -___ .-_.--_____________________ ~~ ___ ~- or execution. A child could be disinherited but not killed by his parents. \"Reasonable\" physical punishment was allowed; apparently this punishment was quite severe. We also reviewed an 'article titled \"Child Abuse and Neglect Part I: Historical Overview, Legal Matrix, and Social Perspectives\" by Mason P. Thomas, Jr. According to Thomas, early treatment of children in this country was based on previous custom as well as English COn'U.11on law. Children could be severely disciplined asa matter of course by parents, teachers, and ministers. Most justi\u00ad fication for punishment was rooted in passages of the Bible. In the 1600' sand 1700' s, few ad::empts were made to punish parents who may have been over-zealous in their harsh treatment of their children. Chiluren from poor families or even from families that were simply too large were placed in apprenticeships and alms\u00ad houses. They shared space in the latter facilities with adult paupers, the insane, and the severely retarded. 9hildren often remained in these facilities until the age of eight, at which time they were placed in apprenticeship, an early form of foster care. This system lasted until 1875, according to Fraser. The first reform movements for children occurred in New York City in the early 1800's. A number of organizations sprang up whose purposes were primarily to keep neglected and abused chil\u00ad dren from becoming criminals or threats to society. Their ori\u00ad ginal aims were not directed toward prevention of abuse or protec\u00ad tion of children-.-- Thomas refers to what has become a famous case of abuse,! one that may have been pivotal in structuring child protective services .m in this country. Unfortunately, the case is misunderstood and al- most always misrepresented. It is the 1874 case of Mary Ellen' Wilson, often referred to simply as the case of Mary Ellen. ~. he details of the case are interesting but will not be dealt withln detail here. Suffice it to say that Mary Ellen Wilson was a young child who\u00b7 had been badly abused by her mot.her in New York City. The case somehow came to the attention of Henry Bergh, who at that time happened to be the president of the ~~erican Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Bergh asked the Society's coun- 1;1 sel, Elbridge T. Gerry, to petition the court for the girl's re- lief. This petition was brought not by the Society, as is often maintained, but by its president acting as a private individual~ As a result of media attention to the case, Gerry then organized the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children that. same year. In his article, Thomas mentions that the Mary Ellen.Wilson !!.lyth invariably is more interesting than the facts of the actual Mary Ellen Wilson case. Thomas says that the core of the myth is this: \"Since there were no laws to protect children, the case was brought to .. couf't on the theory that the child was a member of the animal kingdom and thus entitled to protection from the same laws that were intended to. protect animals.\" 'The point is meant to be shocking: how can it be that we provide better protections for our \" animals than we do; for our children? -8-i j. Thomas clarifies the myth thus: \"Laws to protect children were not lacking but were not enforced systematically. The case was not brought into court by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals on the theory that this child was entitled to the legal protection afforded animals; rather, it was initiated by the founder of this society acting as an individual, using the Society's attorney, by a petition for a writ de homine replegiando [an old English writ of law intended to remove-a person from one person's custody to another's], on the basis of which the court issued a special warrant to bring the child before the court.\" Ultimately, as a result of the court's hearing this case, criminal action was taken against Mary Ellen Wilson's mother, who was convicted of assault and battery and sentenced to a year at hard labor in the penitentiary. The real significance of the case was the formation of the first of many societies for the prevention of cruelty to children. Soon after the original formed in New York City in 1874, it ac\u00ad quired police powers that it still maintains today. Thomas de\u00ad scribes the original society thus: It was organized as a private group in 1874 and later incor\u00ad porated under legislation that authorized cruelty societies to file complaints for the violation of any laws affecting children and that required law enforcement and court officials to' aid agents of the societies in the enforcement\u00b7 of these laws. The Society placed its agents into every courtroom dealing with destitute, neglected, or wayward children and offered judges their opinions concerning when children should be committed and to which institutions. Further legislation in 1881 gave the power of arrest to agents of the societies and made it a misdemeanor for anyone to interfere with or obstruct the work of the societies. ,! By 1890, the Society was present in all boroughs of New York and was responsible for 15,000 children, costing the city $1.5 million. Thomas adds this remark to further fill in the picture of how\" the Society operated: liThe Society's vigorous law enforcement methods greatly increased the number of children who received in\u00ad stitutional care in orphan asylums and who became wards of public or private charities. However, their methods te~ded to discourage adoption or family foster placements.\" After the formation of the Society in ~874, many other simi\u00ad lar groups formed. Some had been organized to deal with cruelty to animals and simply added children to their protection lists. Some formed to protect both animals and children. Between 1875 and 1900 twenty ,\"cruelty\" societies confined their activities to pro\u00ad tection for children. By 1900, 161 societies existed in this country designed to protect animals or children or both. -9- Thomas adds a long parenthetical comment to the Mary Ellen Wilson case and its impetus toward the formation of societies to protect children. Here he refers to the establishment of police powers for agents of these organizations: The NYSPCC [New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children], having been organized first, became the model for the law-enforcement approach to child rescue, with its agents exercising police powers under legislative authority.'l'his ap\u00ad proach seemed punitive to some reformers since it often separated children from their parents and emphasized the prosecution of parents, who were often punished by jailor prison sentences. Other child protection groups in Massachusetts and, Philadelphia ,; did not approve Of the tendency of anti-cruelty societies to become anns of the police. Theyowere conce:r;ned about preve.tl.tive, remedial, and economic efforts that would strengthen the home so that a child might remain with his parents. These early dis\u00ad agreements provided the seeds for the growth and development of contemporary thinking on effective methods of child protec\u00ad tion. The modern social-work approach to protection--protective services~-tends to avoid this punitive approach, but these dif\u00ad ferences in concept. and philosophy have continued into the twentieth century. The rest of Thomas' article traces the changes in emphasis be\u00ad tween the private and' public sectors. Both slpwly moved towar~ , strengthening of the child's own home, and\u00b7 the overall.respons~\u00adbility for child protection became a public respons~bility as . federal and state legislation chapged to mandate ch~ld protect~on measures. Private child humane societies continued to grow, ~ow\u00ad ever, peaking in 1922 with 414. By 1967, there were only ten such groups left in the country. Thomas' article addresses the founding of Juvenile court';j.n Cook County, Illinois, in 1899. It was the first such specia~!;1Lzed court in the country. Thomas notes that the court and the la~tls pertinent to it were drafted in 1898 by a \"co~ittee of s?c;:ial leaders and lawyers,\" and he goes on to descrJ.be the found~ng of the court and its early philosophy: The juvenile court was also that product of pol{~ical compro\u00ad mise between private sectarian interests that operated the industrial schools and state welfare authorities who believed strongly in state-operated institutions for dependent and ne\u00ad glected children~ The 1899 juvenile court law continued the blurring of distinctions between neglected, dependent, ~d delinquent cnildren and the practice of mixing these children in the same institutions--sometimes under repressive and puni\u00ad tive conditions. 7: \" The terms \"dependent\" and \"neglected\" were used interchangeably in the 1899 juvenile court law, and these terms were defined in words that described'conditions that werebelleved \u00b7to lead to crime in the early nineteenth century. The name of the court was new, but t.he simplistic philosophy linking poverty, neglect, -10-~ .... r L j j 1 ~ I I [ ~ i ] f ~ W-iil ~ ! and crime has remained unchanged. Moreover, it has continued as a major theme of' juvenile corrections into the twentieth century. According to Thomas, in effect this new law substituted the stflte for parents who could not control or provide for their children(: { Thoma$ argues that the law was, disturbimg because it was written by middle-class people to apply only tb lower-class people. As abuse became morerecognizeq, the states adopted laws to ,deal with it.. By 1967 all 50 stat~s had a reporting provision. 'fBy 1972, 45 states haC!. mandato.ry reporting~ the other five had voluntary reporting pt-ocedures. In mandatory reporting, certain \"classes\" of people are required to report cases of suspected or confirmed abuse, depending on the wording of the law. The most obvious and common group of mandated reporters is that of doctors. Illinois law now includes teachers, coroners, police, private so-cial workers, and many other classes of people, as do several of the other states' more progressive laws. Thomas offers the following concluding remarks: This his'cory of child protection in the United states indicates tmatpublic interest in children is cyclical, recurring between periods of relative indifference.\u00b7\u00b7 The decade of the 1960' s was the first time in a century that wide public interest was at\u00ad tracted by the complex and emotional problems related to pro\u00ad tecting children from physical maltreatment by their own parents. The problem had been repressed from public consciousness. protective services \"to parents could usually provide child protection withoqt the necessity of removing the child from his nwp home. The fact that reporting laws have been passed has served to assure the publ'ic--perhaps unrealistically--that chil\u00ad !irenare being protected and that parents are being helped. So much has been written about child abuse and its many components that it would be impossible to even refer to every article or book. Further research will be summarized as this report progresses when specific subj~cts :Decome pertinent. ~ ,D. Companion ReEortFollow-up We have referred to the two other investigations the Commis\u00ad sion has complete<i that de'al with maltreatment of children was publ~shed ~n October 1980. On' October 9 and 10, 1980, the Commission h.~ld public hearings in Chicago on matters pertinent to both investi\u00ad gations and both reports. Some of those matters directly relate to this report. In Child Molestation: The Criminal Justice Sys\u00ad ~, we presented\" a brief section updating ~he 7\"eader on several specific case studies from. our Sexual Explo~tat~on r~po:t. Here, we will provide further updated inf9rmation, discuss brJ.efly the hearings, and offer other general remarks about the effeets of our previous two reports. -11-I i \u00b7-------- I ~ At the public hearings, the Commissioners heard testimorlY from a variety of experts in the fields of corrections, law en\u00ad forcement, probation, and others. First to testify were two prostitutes who had been identified by Commis.sion staff as having begun their illegal careers as juven\u00ad iles or as young adults posing as juveniles. Through their testi\u00ad mony, we were able to receive the perspective of the girl on the street. Their experiences apply to this report only in that many girls run away to escape abus,ive homes or foster homes. We will examine cases in which just that did occur later. We heard testimony from Dr. Frank Osanka, Professor of Soci\u00ad ology and Social Justice at Lewis UniversitYi He confirmed most of the impressions and conclusions reported in the two reports and has since adopted the reports as texts for his courses. Dr. Stephen Hardy, Administrator of Menard Psychiatric Center of the Illinois Department of Corrections, t.estified about the Sex\u00ad ually Dangerous Persons Act and his program designed to rehabili\u00ad tate sex offenders who volunteer to be admitted to the program. We had previously determined that the Menard program was the only correctional option for such an inmate wishing to be rehabilitated in Illinois. Rudolph Nimocks and William F. Keating, both of the Chicago Police Department, addressed the issue of sex crime, training of officers assigned to sex crime invQlving juveniles, and the role of the courts and correctional faci~.ities. We heard similar testimony frol.~ William a r Sullivan and Thomas Schumpp, both of the Illinois Department of Law Enforcement. O'Sullivan also described in detail a new computerized program de\u00ad signed to track sex offenders and provide local jurisdictions with leads in sex crime cases. Representing the court system on the first day of hearings were Lake County Assistant staters Attorney genry E. Mueller and Richard J. Fitzgerald, Presiding Judge of the Criminal Division, Cook County Circuit Court. Mueller ran through the normal proce\u00ad dure of preparation of a case involving a sex crime against a child. Fitzgerald presented an eloquent argument for judicial discretion in sex crime sentencing, an argument our Child Molestation report endorsed strongly. On the second day of hearings, the parents of two girls who had been the victims of sex crimes testified. Th,ey provided a realistic and moving account of the emotions victims and victims' parents go through when a sex crime is committed against a young child. Susan Weaver testified as a representative of the Cook County Juvenile Probation Office. She has worked personally \"with one of the child prostitutes profiled in our Sexual Exploitation report and reiterated our conclusion that few child prostitute rings are operating anywhere in .the city. I) -12-1 I Susan Yellig and Barbara White testified as social workers from Children's Memorial Hospital. They offered an expert view of the trauma seen at the hospital level and methods parents, the po\u00ad lice, prosecutors, and others could use to reduce the trauma suf\u00ad fered by a child victim of a sex crime. Our final witness was William B. Kelley, Co-Chairperson of the Illinois Gay Rights Task Force. Kelley indicated his organi\u00ad zation's concern that homosexuals not be portrayed as preying on young children, when such is so rarely the case. He applauded our presentation of cases, which made it clear that chi~d molestation is not a homosexual problem at all, but a broad soc1etal problem. The hearings provided the public with information that bol\u00ad stered the findings and conclusions presented in our two reports. They made clear th~ Commission's ongoing interest in the rights and treatment of cliildren, particularly child victims. And they laid part of the groundwork for the continuation of our child abuse investigation. Several specific sections of our previous two reports should be consulted by the interested reader for information on abused or neglected children. The Sexual Exploitation report makes it clear that some children involve themselves in child pornography schemes because of parental neglect. Such was the case with some of,child pornographer John Spargo's victims. Spargo was,able to conV1nce many young boys to engage in sex with him and to pose for porno\u00ad graphic photos because their parents, who wer7 almos~ all weal~hy, had little time to spend with them. Other ch1ldren ,1nvolved w1th some of the men who are profiled in that report also app~ar to be neglected children. Many of the men--and ~ome~--arreste~ and,con\u00ad victed of child pornography schemes or tak1ng 1ndecent 11bert1es with a child specialized in finding victims who came from fc:>ster homes, victims with low self-images, victims who were chron1c run\u00ad aways. Both of our long case studies in Sexual,Exploitati()~ of two Chicago-area prostitutes--onemale, one female:--are of ch1l~ren who had been physically abused and who, had extens1ve c(;>ntact w1th the Cook County Juvenile Cou:rt. The g7rl thc;tt w7 stud1ed, as far as we can determine, is still a prost1tute 1n M1lwaukee. ..The boy was . murdered two years ago. In Sexual Exploitationi we present the. research findings of a study rnto ma.le sex rings. Many of the victims enticed into such rings had been abused or neglectea prior to their a~sociation with the people who formed the rings. Virtually our ent1r~ ax;aly\u00adsis of female prostitution centers around wards of the I111~01S Department of Children and Family , Services: We pre~ent an 7nb~r\u00ad view, with one such ward and make 1.t clear 1n a sect1o~ on p~m~>1ng that many: of the girls' (of age or below it) involved 1n prost1tu\u00ad tion are runaways from abuse or neglect. \\ 1 I Child Molestation presents fewer ties to this report on child abuse. Our previous investigations into child molestation and child prostitution and child pornography lead us to provide a dis\u00ad tinction among the victims of these crimes. In some cases of child molestation, the victims are. unknown to the offenders and are forc\u00ad ibly raped or otherwise molested in single incidents. However, a significant number of the victims of child molestation know their attackers and often are unwilling to report them because they may be friends of the family, because of fear, or for a variety of other reasons. They are not willing victims in spite o,f their seeming unwillingness to report their attackers. Further compli\u00ad cating these distinctions is the fact that some child molesters are also child pornographers. In fact, most child pornographers do engage in sexual activity with children. In sharp contrast to these types of victims are children who become prostitutes. Though it is true that certain factors may influence their decision to prostitute, generally they make a conscious decision to earn money through their activities. Only rarely are they coerced into lives of prostitution. When Commission staff attendee, the Fifth National Conference on Child Abuse and Neglect in Mi1w9lLtkee in April, 1981, there were numerous workshops that treated th,~1 subjects of child pornography and child prostitution. Only one mf the presentations could even marginally be linked to child molestation. This seeming diverg~nce can be problematic .,in one important regard: the effects of chjJJ.d molestation, chi1d\\pornography, and child prostitution on their victims are often sl.lni1ar. Eurthermore, these effects are similar to the effects that intrafamilial sexual abuse (incest) may have on children. In this regard, these four areas are integrally re\u00ad lated. Because we treat the effects of intrafamilial sexual abuse in great detail later, we will not dwell on the effects that child molestations, child pornography, and child prostitution have on victims. Instead, we refer the interested reader to sections of our Child Molestation report. While that report is issue-oriented, with chapters devoted to discrete areas of concern. all of the descriptions of the victims in chapters. discussing specific crimes, as well as many interviews with. experts in the field\" mention the traumatic aftereffects that child molestation usually has on a young boy or girl. i Unlike the victims in Sexual Exploitation, the victims of Child Molestation do not come from broken homes. They are not run\u00ad aways from abusive or neglectful parents. Most victims are involved without cause~-at random. They are chosen by the molester simply because they are handy. The victims may suffer at the hards of a burdensome judicial system, at the hands of insensitive parents, and at the hands of a system that has less than complete regard for their emotional wellbeing ~ollowing a mo1est~tion or molestation attempt. Victims may experience tlie same fear of men experienced by rape victims; they may withdraw, as do incest victims; they may \"act out,\" as do victims of child pornography. Almost all of the -14-i\\ -,y ---~~----- --~ ----- - effects we later describe when we detail cases of incest also oc\u00ad cur to victim,s of child molestati.on. For that reason alone an examination of Child Molestation may be valuable. ' There is anothe\\r reason for the interested reader to do so ~owever. ~e di~covered a high incidence of abused children gro~\u00ad ~p to be ch~ld molesters. Not all child molesters are psy\u00ad cnot~c or mentally deranged, though some are. Many have reacted badly to the trauma of abuse, particularly sexual abuse, while they were young. Some of the offenders profiled in our report are extr~mely young. Others have long histories of sexual abuse. The ti~le of.thi~ rep~rt is The Child Victim. After spending ~ou7 ~nvest~gat~ng d~fferent types and form$ of victimization, ~t ~s clear to us that all child victims share some aftereffects in common. Of particular interest to readers involved in the field o~ incest should be our Appendix B to Child Molestation. It con\u00ad s~sts of the Chicago Hospital Council's \"Guide1ines for the Treat\u00adment of Suspected Rape Victims. II We now return briefly to our report on Sexual Exploitation. II?-that report we mentiqn that during the course of our investiga\u00ad t~on, several individuals involved in sexual offenses against chil\u00ad dren were identified by a Commission undercover investigator. In several cases,.th7 ~nformation was sufficient to persuade police to arrest the ~nd~v~duals. We presented data on seven such indi\u00ad v~duals and added additional information about several more. We w~ll update the status of these individuals below. Clarence Richard Barnett was arreste~ in Indiana on December 12, 1978. Barnett was convicted, and on March 12, 1979, Barnett was sentenced to one year imprisonment for Distribution of Obscene Matter. Barnett, a Baptist minister, had failed to provide bond and had spent several months in jail. The remainder of his sentence was suspended. Barnett now lives in Ge?rgia. J~hI?-P. Mika1auskas was arrested on E'ebruary 11, 1980, after h7 e~h~b~ ted and offered to sell pornographic pictures to a Com\u00ad ni~ss~on undercover agent. On February 14, 1980, the DuPage County Grand Ju~y indicted Mikalauskas on one count of exhibition of child pornography, one count of deviate sexual assault, and three counts of indecent liQerties with a child., Mikalauskas entered into a plea agreement whereby all charges except the indecent liberties charges were dropped. On November 7, 1980, despite a sentencing recommendatio~ by the State'$ Attorney's Office that Mikalauskas rece:i,:ve {iears' imprisonment, was sentenced to of th.e probation included non-as so\u00ad ciatidn 'with the victims of the indecent liberties charges as well as psychiatric and vocational counseling. David I. Preston was arrested at his place of business in Belleville, Illinois,onJanuary 17, 1980. Ultimafely, Preston was \"charged with a violation of the \"Harmful Material\" statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 38, Sf 11-21. Unlike the child pornography -15-.~-~---~----- ----~ ---. statute, the \"Harmful Materialll statute is only a misdemeanor of\u00ad fense. The prosecutor handling the case told us she would suggest one year's probation as a sentence. Preston was sentenced on June 20, 1980, to one year's probation. Richard J~~s Seeden was arrested on August 13, 1979. Seeden had met with a Commission undercover agent and had given him several pornographic Polaroid pictures. Seeden was charged with delivery and exhibition of child pornography. Se~den was convicted and sen\u00ad tenced on July 24, 1980 to one year's imprisonment. . On ~ebru~ry 5, 1979, ~obert C. Simmons was arrested and charged w1th,a v10lat10n of the ch11d pornography statute. Commission in\u00ad vest1gators had subpoenaed him to testify in our offices regarding his \"business,\" the Media Exchange. Simmons admitted to us in a statement that he had mailed lists of child pornography he offered for sale.. On August 30, 1979, Assistant ,State's Attorney Robert Zadek dec1ded not to pursue the charges against Simmons. The charges were stricken on leave to reinstate but never were. John R. Spargo communicated on several occasions with a Commi\u00ad ssion undercover investigator. Our investigator met with Spargo on Au.gust 17, 1979, at McHenry Darn State cPark. Spargo brought with him a l~rge.photo.album containing 76 Polaroid photographs of 12 boys en\u00ad gag1ng 1n var70us sexual activities. At that time, Spargo was ar\u00ad rested by pla1nclothes officers of the McHenry County Sheriff's De\u00ad partment and charged with a violation of the child pornography statute. On Oct<;,ber 29, 1~80, Spargo was sentenced to $1,000 fine and two years' probat10n follow1ng his conviction for exhibiting child oornograohy. ~fter sentence, Spargo was arrested on Ja~uary 8,'1983 1n Bettendorf, Iowa, on charges of lascivious acts with a child and indecent contact with a child. . ~he fir~t person arrested as a direct result of our investiga\u00ad t10n 1nto ch1ld pornography was Donald Warren a me7ting with a. Commission the purpose o(~is\u00ad ~laY1ng and se111ng samp1e~ of child pornography. During the ~eet- 1ng on December ,2, 1977, W1tt was arrested by agents of the Illinois Department of Law Enforcement. Because Witt was arrested urior to the effective date of the Illinois child pornography statute he,was charged with Exhibiting Obscene Mat~r.tal and sate of Obscene'Haterial. Witt agreed to plead guilty; in exCi'hange for his guilty plea, Witt was placed on one year's court supervision and directed to furnish the Cpmmission with any informa~,ion he had regarding the manufacture or sale of child pornography. Witt was 'unable to furnish the Com\u00ad mission with much information except certain oersonal details in\u00ad cluding his-sexual involvement with young boy; prior to his i~volve- ment with child pornography. - . The fifth chapter of Sexual Exploitation reports on arrests of f7gures o~her than those with whom Commission investigators were d1rectly 1nvolved. One case reported was that of the husband- wife team of Raymond and Lori Brown. The Browns were arrested on AprilS, 1978, and charged with taking indecent liberties with a child after a 13-year-old ward of the state threatened suicide be- -16-, cause of her despondence concerning her sexual involvement with the couple. This young girl, together with some of her classmates, had been involved sexually with both Browns. Raymond Brown had filmed some of the sexual activities between Lori and the girls. When the Browns were arrested, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services assumed temporary custody of the Browns' one\u00ad year-old daughter. On March 4, 1980, Raymond and Lori Brown were both convicted of taking indecent liberties with a child. Raymond Brown was sen\u00ad tenced to five years' imprisonment; Lori Brown received four years' probation~-, As we reported in Sexual Exploitation, \"Pamela [the Brown's daughterJ was returned to her mother's care after a spokes\u00ad person for the Department of Children and Family Services stated that the department was not concerned with what parents were 'into' but whether they treated their children well.\" When we questioned Brown's probation officer, she told us that her office did not have a working relationship with DCFS, so she could not tell us anything about the status of the daughter. Brown's new probation officer told us that she was doing well. We also learned that Raymond Brown was incarcerated on April 11, 1980, and ultimately was transferred to the Logan Correctional Facility. Brown was to have been eligible for parole 2~ years af\u00adter the date of his original incarceration, with adjustments for \"good\" and \"badll time. In February of 1982, Commission investiga\u00ad tors made a routine check on Raymond Brown and learned that he had been paroled on December 10, 1981. We also learned that counsel\u00ad ing was not a con.dition of Raymond Brown's sentence while at Logan. Next, we contacted John Frattinger of the Uptown Parole Office. Frattinger is con\u00ad ditions of Brown's parole: they are the normal conditions imposed on most parolees. There is no provision for counseling or psy\u00ad chiatric care. When we asked Frattinger why Brown had been re\u00ad leased so early, he told us that Brown had served three months \"before being released on bail. He also served a brief period of time aft,er his conviction. Brown was credi t~d with six months of \"good time\" after he had been at Logan. Thus, Brown did in effect serve 2~ years of his original five-year sentence. Finally, we determined that the DCFS case on Pamela Brown had been closed on November 12, 1979, and no further monitoring of the child is being done by DCFS. Commission investigators initiated a case regarding a man thought to be involved in child pornography in 1979. A Commission undercover investig~,tor wrote to David Kummer of Maple Park, Illi\u00ad nois, after reading an advertisement Kummer had placed maga- !, -17------~~------ ~ .---~. ---_. ----- zine titled The Compendium. A full description of this magazine is contained on pages 40-42 of Sexual Exploitation. In brief, the magazine was a preteen heterosexual journal that catered to child molesters and private child pornographers. Its editor stated in an issue that \"The Compendium is a service designed to assist you in the biological phenomenon of puberty.\" Its owner was ar-, rested in 1978 and the magazine's mailing list was confiscate~ by the Los Angeles Police Department. Our undercover investigator wrote a letter of inquiry about services that Kummer's Studio 9 could provide. Kummer responded with a letter to one of our undercover postal boxes. A meeting was arranged between Kummer and our investigator. On October 23, 1979, Kummer and our investigator met in the American Room Cafe\u00ad teria of the Sears Tower in Chicago. Kummer told our agent at , that time that he was interested in young girls, particularly be\u00ad tween the ages of 9 Cl;nd 12. He told him that he had taken thou~\u00ad ands of pictures of young girls, many of them at a supposed nud~st camp near Marengo, I.11inois. Kummer told him also that, whenever possible, he has the girl's parents sign what he, called a \"model release form.\" He said that other photographs had been taken at his home or at the home of one of the young girls. At this meeting, Kummer told our investigator that he had en\u00ad gaged in sexual activities with many of the girls he had photo\u00ad graphed. Kummer told our investigator that he had conferred with his attorneys and planned to publish a photo album of his work. Kummer told our investigator that he saw nothing wrong with adult males engaging in sex with preteen females, and his artwork.was to be, an expression of his philosophy, though he never ment~oned pub17sh\u00ad ing photographs of sexual activity itself. (~rior to and immed~I.},tely following the meeting, our investigator met w~th agents of ~he ' Illinois Department of Law Enforcement, who conducted surve~llance of the meeting throughout.) At this meeting, Kummer also ref~rred t~ his family ~ife . He ' sta\u00b7ted that he and his wife often made love ~rt front of h~s ch~ldren and that one of his children even helped posi'tion Kummer and his wife for oral sex. KUItUlter said that \"children are brought into this world for the entertainment of their parents,\" and admitted that both he and his wife perfprmed oral sex on his daughters on numerous occasions. Commission st.aff took the information we had developed to Kane County First Assistant State's Attorney Patricia P. G~l~en, who indicated her interest in pursuing the case. The dec~s~on was made among representatives of the State's Attorney's Office and the De\u00ad partment of Law Enforcement to try to develop a case for crimi~a~ prosecution. They proceeded with the case but were unable to de\u00ad velop sufficient information for criminal prosecution. The case was dropped. -18-1) -'I f, d -~-- - ~ -'--- --~ I heard about you from a friend quiet some time ago. Perhaps we have similar interests?

David Kummer -20----:..........------ ~-- Subsequently, Postal Inspector John Ruberti had independently developed a number of advertisements that child molesters might be attracted to, and Kummer had responded to one of these ads. Ruberti met with Kummer at Kummer's studio in Batavia in October of 1981. A~ that time, Ruberti ordered six photographs of nude pre-pubescent g1rls and scheduled a tentative photo session with Kummer to photo\u00ad graph Kummer's seven-year-old daughter. Ruberti if Kummer's daughter could \"touch her\u00ad self\" for these photo sessions. Kummer allegedly replied that if a friend of his daughter touched her, that would be between the friend and his daughter. Kummer said that either he or his wife would be present at the photo sessions and that they would charge Ruberti $60. Finally, Ruberti asked Kummer if Kummer's wi.fe could be photographed with their daughter. Kummer said he wasn't sure but thought that she would agree. ); \" Commission investigators accompanied officers from various law enforcement agencies to the Kummer's Maple Park home on the evening of October 26, 1981, to observe the search and arrest of Kun~er and his wife. Search warrants had been obtained for both Kummer's horne and studio. Batavia Po'lice Department officers arrested the Kum\u00ad mers at the time and DCFS worker Mary Regen took the Kummers' three children to be temporarily placed in foster homes. David Kummer was charged with the following offenses: two counts of taking indecent liberties with a child; two counts\u00b7 of obscenity; 'three counts of child pornography: two counts of inde\u00ad cent solicitation of a child; one count of contributing to the ne\u00adglect of a child; one count of cruelty to a child; and one count of unlawful possession. of marijuana. Gail KUmmer was charged with one count of contributing to the neglect of a child, one count of cruelty to a child, and one count of unlawful possession of mari\u00ad juana. These charges are a mixture of felonies and misdemeanors. Bond for David Kummer was set at $25,000; bond for Gail Kummer was set at $10,000. An addi'tional bOI)d of $15, OQO was levied on each of the Kummers for the marijuana charges. Kane County prosecutors had been unable to proceed more quick\u00ad ly with this case. When the Kummers finally were arrested in October, 1981, the existing child'pornography statute did not cover their ac\u00ad tions. Public Act 82-028'7, which amended the child pornography statute (Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 38, CJI ll-20a) and which took e:6fect January 1, 1982, filled what the Commission viewed as a loophole in the child pornography law. It had been our hope that situations such as the one presented by the Kumrners could be resolved through such a law, which we f.eel would have covered the content of the photogr~phs confiscated from the Kumrners' home. The Act was co\u00ad sponsored by Representative~haddeus S. Lechowicz and Senator Ade\u00ad line J. Geo-Karis, now a Commission member. .. Unfortuflately, in spite of the workp'lt into this case, most charges against the Kummers were dropped pursuant to a plea agree\u00ad ment.\" Circuit Judge Paul Schnake accepted a guilty plea from the Kummers to a misd~meanor charge of possession of marijuana. The -2,2-~~~---~-~~~-~~ -~~~ ---------~-----~-- Kummers were sentenced to six months' probation. The judge al~o ordered through a stipulation of facts to the offense of contr1- buting to the neglect of a child and ordered the Kumme::s,to be , placed on 12 months' court supervision. If the superv1s10n ~er10d ends without incident, the Kummers' record with regard to ch1ld neglect may be expunged. Under the terms of the p~e,a agreement, the Kurnmers will receive custody of their three ~h1ldren but,the entire family must continue to receive psycholog1cal,counsel7ng. The Kummers are banned from making nude photos of ch1ldren, 1n\u00ad eluding their own. All photographic equipment confisca~ed by the police was to be returned to them. The Kummers each pa1d court costs, as well, which were minimal. Judge Schnake indicated that none of the confiscate~ photo\u00ad graphs was even remotely obscene~ An attorney.represent1~g the that the,Kummers are \"very car1n~ and lov:-ng par\u00ad ents,\" and a psychologist hired to assess the ch1ldren ~a~d.that they had suffered no trauma from any of the alle~e~ ~Ct1V1t17s of their parents. The attorney, William Bochte! cr1t1c1zed med1a attention to the case, saying that if the ch1ldren have b7en ~:~ fected adversely by the incident, to me~J.a a ... 1..7n\u00ad tion.\" The Kummers have also voiced their displeasure w1th the1r recent media exposure. There seem to have been problems with the criminal case pre\u00ad sented against the Kummers. We can only report what we know about the Kurnmers based on what we have seen and based on wha~ David Kummer told our investigator. The Kummer Case reemp~as1zes what we found in our Sexual Exploitation report: that ch1ld molesters and child pornographers are usually w111 to the1r activities, given enough 'time. It is unl1kely the law enforc:~ment community has heard the last of the ,Kurnmers. ~~. Another case that Commission investigators id7ntified during the course of our child abuse investigation bu~ wh:-ch properly be\u00ad longs with these other cases of child molestat10r;t 1S that of.John. D. McCauley. His case came to our attention dur1ng the rout:-ne investigation of an abuse case ending in death. One of o~r 1n\u00ad vestigators spoke with Villa Park policeman Andr7w D. S~bJect re\u00ad garding a case Subject had handled and was told 1n ~ass1ng of the McCauley case. Subject made ,reference to the case 1n context of discussing his problems with DCFS. McCauley h~d been,cau~ht molest\u00ad ing a child in his care and had been charged w1th tak1ng 1ndecent liberties with a child. The pad thing T,!a~,that McCauley ~as a _ licensed. foster SubJec~ al that McCauley's license had exp1~;ea but that. D~FS cont1nued to send children to his day-carecent~,r for superv1s1on. ~1cCauley was arrE1,sted on Feb::uary performing a deviate sexual act w1th a ~llegedly had occurred in July, 1979. William Kohnke told reporters that his -22-./1 27 1981, and charged ~ith si~-year-old boy . ' The act Villa Park Police Chief office had been inves.:tigat~. ',) I .' ~ j ~ r 1 ~. I ~: , i, ; 1 , I .ing McCauley for about six months following a tip that irregular activities were occurring between McCauley and children for whom he \"babysat.\" Bond was set for $10,000. . Leo Olsen, Director of Building and Zoning for Villa Park, sa1d that McCauley had been licensed by DCFS since at least July 1, 1980, but McCauley refused to apply for a village license re\u00ad qu~red by vill~ge or~inance. Olsen told reporters for the Chicago Tr1bune that h1s off1ce had contacted McCauley several times but never was able to get inside his home to conduct an inspection. McCauley had even wrl,.tten a letter on June 13, 1980, to a state legislator in hopes of getting aid in finding a \"loophole\" in the Villa Park ordinance, . ,) Police reports of the arrest of February 27, 1981, indicate that warrants had been obtained for a ,search of MCCauley's home. The warrants specified that pornographic material was to be searched for. A ~arrant also was provided to allow the mother of one of the alleged victims to enter McCauley' s home with a concealed transmitter. Police entered after the woman had engaged McCauley in conversation. The police reports indicate that sexual abuse of children may have been occurring as early as October, 1977, and that some of the abusive incidents occurred with overnight child guests at the same time that McCauley had permanent foster children in the horne. McCauley met several of his victims at a Cub Scout activity at one of the Villa Park elementary schools. Commission investigators 'who examined this case found out from DuPage County State's Attorney Criminal Division Chief Thomas L. Knight that MCCauley had been accused of taking indecent liberties as ea,rly as 1976. ., MCCauley had been arrested, according to Knight, but the charges were dropped. McCauley pled guilty to one count of taking indecent liberties with a ch:i,ld for his actions in the latest case mentioned. McCauley was sentenced to four years' probation with special conditions that he serve 90 days in. jailor 180 days on work release to begin April 11, 1983. He was fined $4,000 and $74 in court costs. Finally, he was required to undergo psychiatl;'ic counseling at the Isa.ac Ray Center, 1720 West Polk Street, Chicago. . Unfortunately, McCauley was not the only foster parent or day\u00ad care worker we discovered who had been involved in child molesta\u00ad tion. Allegations about such workers surfaced on occasion during our investigation. Actually, these allegations are not surprising, given our findings in Sexual Exploitation. People like McCauley tend to involve themselves as closely as possible to Children: that is undoubtedly why he was involved in a Cub Scout function even though he had no children oi,his own in the Cub Scouts. Many of the offenders profiled in our previous two reports managed to get themselves int9 situations ~n which they ha9 close proximity to children. You can hardly get closer to children than by becoming -23-I~\\ -------- ----------~--~----------~--------------------~------~ a foster parent--or a worker in any portion of the child welfare field. Furthermore, many children involved in the child welfare system are somewhat more susceptible to being approached for sex\u00ad ual purposes. Many feel that they have no one to whom they can turn for help--except, perhaps, their foster parent. Many are runaways. Marly are relatively unstable in their own personal at\u00ad titudes toward many things, sex included. Though we only looked at the Kaleidoscope, Inc. group homes in passing, we learned that Karl Turner, a former Kaleidoscope staff member, pled guilty to engaging in sexual relations with a 16-year-old,Hirl living in one of Kaleidoscope's homes in Bloom\u00ad ington, IllinOis. As conditions of the plea agreement, Turner was fined $100 and ordered to serve 12 months'''court supervision. Also as part of the agreement, a second charge of contributing to the sexual delinquency of a child was dropped. We l;?arned in late May of 1982 that anothel:' Kaleidoscope coun\u00ad selor ha~; been arrested and charged wth contributing to the delin\u00ad quency of a 14-year-old girl. A night-care counselor named Eric Tapley of Bloomington was charged with the offense after his su\u00ad pervisor learned about incidents involv~ng Tapley and one of the Kaleidoscope clients. Tapley was terminated by Kaleidoscope, pled guilty to \u00b7the offense on June 16, 1982, and was fined $100. \", Following this incident, DCFS initiated a freeze on referrals to the Bloomington-Normal Kaleidoscope facility until a DCFS licens\u00ad ing review could be completed. A five-member special committee of the Illinois House of Representatives was charged with review\u00ad ing Kaleidoscope and reconu'ne~ding whether or not the state should continue funding. j At the same time, Kaleidoscope ~moved to replace male nigf~f staffers with women; increased the average age difference bety;\\een staff and wards by hiring older people1 and stepped up surprise spot checks at night~ - The DCFS review led to a lifting of t4e placement freeze, and the House special committee recommended in a report released in November that no negative sanctions be taken C!-gainst the child\u00ad care 'agency. The report described the criminal acts as \"isolated\" and took cognizance of Kaleidoscope's steps to minimize their oc- currence in 'the future. \\1 We will report on O\"ther improprieties as they occur within the purview of spee'ific cases.\"~ It'lshould be clear to the reader by this time that-sexgal exploitation, child molestation, and child abu:::;e are related problemsv not only because of the involvement' of elements of the state chi'ld~protective and welfare systems, but also because children wAo ~\\re victimized lay themselves open to further victimization.\" Any pne of these three areas cart lead to furtrfu{ vict~ization in a vicious circle that can be diffi- cult to b;t;:,eak.. \". .\\ As we mentioned, our previous two reports are being used by' teachers, police departmentsf and courts as training materials and texts. Our 'Chief Investigator has partiCipated in a number of \\) , -, I ,.

Sexual Exploitation and Child Molestation: Upd~te on Legal Issues As a result of\u00b7 the t~o commission. reports issued during 1980, Sexual Exploitation of Ch~ldren and Ch~ld Molestation: The Crimi\u00ad nal Justice System, the Commission sponsored or supported the fol= lowing legislation: 1. Sexual Exploitation of Children Iiegislati.on a. Senate Bill 1, enacted into law as Public Act 82-341, a~ends the Criminal C?d~ of 1961 (a~ leg~slat~on fro~ a ?l~s~ 4 felony to a.Class 1 felony for the following offenses: Sol~c~t~ng for a Juven~le Prostitute\" and \"Juvenile l?iI?ping. CI It also adds a section on II Exploi tation' of a Child II 'for w~~ch the penalty for violation is a Class X felony. ,This le~isla\u00ad t~on was approved August 26, 1981, and became effective as of that date. b. I.Iouse Bill 287, enacted into law q.s Public Act 82-287 amends the Criminal Code ,of 1961' (at Ill. Rev: Ch. 38, i 11-' 20a (a) (2) (F\u00bb. \"' This legislation amends the child pornography law to incluq:e as prohibited sexu;al conduct the exhibition '19, 1981, and became effectl.ve January 1, 1982. This is the new legislation referred to in the Kummer case aboy-e. 2. Child Molestation Legislation a.' Senate Bill 618, enacted into law as Public Act 82- 694( amends the Criminal Code of 1961 (at Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 38, ! 11-4.1). \"\" This legislation creates the offense of. \"Aggravated Indecent Liberties with a Child,\" which provides that avictiinizer -25-\" .\\e: '- of pre-adolescent children is guilty of a Class X felony. This legislation was certified November 12, 1981, and became effective July 1, 1982. b. Senate Bill 1078, enacted into law as Public Act 82-180, amends the Criminal Code of 1961 (at Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 38, ~ 11-11.1). This legislation creates the offense of \"Sexual Abuse of a Child by a Family Member\" and makes a violation a Class 3 felony. This legislation was approved August 13, 1981, and became effective January 1, 1982. c. House Bill 288, enacted into law as Public Act 82- 712, creates the Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation Treatment Center Act (at Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 23, ~~ 2081-2087), which is dis\u00ad cussed in Section C of Chapter 3. This legislation was certified November 12, 1981, and became effective July 1, 1982. d. Senate Bill 1077, enacted into law as Public Act 82-782, adds a new section to the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 (at Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 38, ~ 115.9). It provides that in a crimi\u00ad nal prosecution for a sexual act perpetrated upon a child under the age of 18, the child can testify that he or she had complained of said sexual act and the person who heard the child's complaint can testify that it had been made, in order to corroborate the child's testimony. This legislation was approved July 10, 1982, and will become effective January 1, 1983. Two other bills were sponsored by Commission members as a re\u00adsult of the Sexual Exploitation and Child Molestatj/)~). 'reports. Senate Bill 741 would have created an exception to the'hearsay rule in prosecutions for sexual acts perpetrated on a child under the age of 13, by allowing an adult to testify as to the details of the child's timely out-of-court statement about such act. House Bill \" 286 would have required film processors to report suspected child 'ornography. However, Senate Bill 741 failed in House subcommittee, ~ House Bill 286 was vetoed by the Governor. 3. John R. Spargo Conviction e case of John R. Spargo was recounted in the Commission's \" l;xploitation of Children report, as we have noted here. The I~ims App~llate Court, Second District, on January ,19, 1982, af\u00ad firmed the conviction of Spargo for th~ offense of ch~ld pornography (Ill. Rev. ftat. Ch~ 38, ~ ll-20a), and affirmed that the law was not overbrocd. Spargo had shown child pornography photographs to a Commission investigator without offering to sell theJtl and was ar\u00ad rested. The appeals court decided that the word \"exhibits\" in the statute prohibited even priyate exhibition or dissemination,of,such material. Spargo had exhibiteq;, the photographs to the Comm~ss~on investigator while in his car, 'where he was arres.ted. In its decision, the court compared the offense of child por\u00ad nogra.phy to obscenity, for which an affirmative def7nse ,that the dissemination was not for personal gain could be raJ.sed. Howev'er, -26-no such defense was allowed for child pornography prosecutions the court said, because the child pornography statute was enacted to regulate against the sexual exploitation of children. It was also held that the law was not so vague that it vio\u00ad lated due process standards. The court disagreed with the defend\u00adant's argument that the statute's standards of obscenity were un\u00ad constitutionally vague, saying that the determinations were to be made with reference to the judgment of \"ordinary adults.\" (See People v. Spargo, 103 Ill. App. 3d 280.) 4. Child Pornography: Recent U.S. Supreme Court Action State legislative approaches to the problem of child pornog\u00ad raphy vary, but they, like Illinois, generally address both the pr~duction and distribution of pornographic materials which depict chJ.ldren. Most commonly, the states, again like Illinois, have followed the lead of the federal government (Protection of Children Against Sexual Exploitation Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251-2253) and have c~eated separate offenses within their criminal codes which speci\u00ad fJ.cally outlaw child sexual exploitation, rather than amend exist\u00ading statutes such as obscenity laws. Child pornography laws are similar to obscenity laws, but many omit the requirement that the material be obscene. Instead, they prohibit using or permitting children to be filmed or photographed in s~e~ificall\u00a5 de~ine~ sexual acts. Additionally, they generally prohJ.bJ.t the dJ.strJ.b~tJ.on and sale of such materials. Obscenity was most recently defined by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1973 case of Miller v. California (413 u.s. 15). In Miller, it was held that a work is obscene if: (a) the average person, applying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; (b) the work depict~ or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by applicable state law; and (c) the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value~ The fede,ral child pornography law cited above outlaws the dist:ribution of \"obscene\" materials which depict children involved in slexually explicit conduct. On the other hand, the ban on the production of the material has no such \"obscenity\" requirement. Many states hc:j.ve followed the federal government and require that material which depicts children involved in sexual conduct be obscene according to the Miller standard, in prosecutions for dis\u00ad tribution of child pornography. 'l'he Illinois statute (Ill. ReV:-\u00ad Sta~.Ch. 38, ~ 11-20a) goes further by incorporating the obscenity standarcL in prosecutions for both the EFoduction and distribution of child\"\"\"pornography. . Unlike those states following the federal law, twenty have attempted to combat the problem by barring both the production and the distribution of material depicting children engaged in set forth -27-11'-Q; ; .4 types of sexual conduct, regardless of whether the material is obscene. New York is one of these states. As it concluded its 1981-82 term, the U.S. Supreme Court on July.2, 1982 upheld the New York criminal statute banning the pro\u00ad duct~~n as ~el~ as the distribution of child pornography regardless of whvthe~ 7t ~s legally obscene. In upholding the New York law that pr~h~b~ts the production, direction or promotion of material portray~ng sexual conduct by children under 16, the Court in New York v. Ferber (455 U.S. 904) ruled that a state has greater-\u00ad ~eeway.under.the First Amendment to regulate pornographic material ~nvol~~n~ ch~ldren than it has in enacting other content-based restr~ct~ons. The result in this case was a major victory for New York pro\u00ad secu~or~, who successfully persuaded the Court to reinstate the conv~ct~on of Paul Ira Ferber, a Manhattan adult bookstore owner for selling two films depicting sexual acts by young boys. ' Writ~n~ for the unanimous Court, Justice Byron White stated in the.op1n~on that the l~gislati~e judgment that using children as subJects of pornograph~c mater~al harms their physiological mental and emotional health \"easily passes muster under the Fi;st ~e~dment.\" .The standard developed in the Miller case for deter\u00ad m7n~ng what sexual thus, according to the ''''0';1rt, the M~ller standard ~s not \"a satisfactory solution to the ch~ld pornography problem.\" . I~ rejecting the argument that the New York statute is uncon\u00ad st1tut~onall\u00a5 overbroad because it could be applied to material that has ser~ous literary, scientific or educational value, the Court stated: \"We consider this the paradigmatic case of a state stat';1te ':lhose legitimate reach dwarfs its arguably impermissible appl~cat~ons.\" . This Commission's Sexual Exploitation of Children report was c1ted as a supportive reference in this U.S. Supreme Court case. ~' .. ( As sta~ed above, obscene ~n prose\\\u00b7:~t~ons fo: both, i tS'production and distribution. However, the product~on of ch~ld pornography constitutes conduct of a typ~ ra:ely thought to implicate First Amendment protections; now, ~n l~ght of New Yorkv. Ferber, even the distribution of child p~rnography cannot be considered a protected First Amendment acti\u00ad v~ty. ch~ld abuse ~n and of ~tself, and Illin01s law should not accord these ~cti~ities Firs~ Amendment protections not required by the U.S. Const~tut~on. Certa~nly, the abuse of a child which o~cur~ dU:ing.the pro~u~tion of pornography and, later, during its d~str~but~on ~s not m~t~gated by a court determination that the material is not obscene. -28-... I II\u00b7 \u00a5 , A proposal concerning amendment of the Illinois child pornog\u00ad raphy statute to effect more ease in prosecution is one of several legislative recommendations discussed in the final chapter of this report. F. ~dressing the Problem of Child Abuse Child abuse is such an overwhelming subject that it can never be addressed exhaustively. This particular section of our report will both summarize some of the ideas presented thus far and intro\u00ad duce issues that we have not yet addressed. The most important issues toward which we are looking deal with state central regis\u00ad tries and the whole method of identification and treatment of abuse and neglect. Brian G. Fraser was Executive Director of the National Com\u00ad mittee for Prevention of Child Abuse in Chicago at the time his article \"A Glance at t.he Past, A Gaze at the Present, A Glimpse at the Future; A Critical Analysis of the Development of Child I..buse Reporting Statutes\" was published in 1978. He is also a graduate of Colorado School of Law and has authored many important essays and articles on the issue of child abuse and neglect. His article examines issues we have discussed, such as the definition of child abuse, and then moves into new areas, offering a brief view of the different processes in the child protective ser\u00ad vices method. Fraser also offers views toward both the history of child abuse and neglect functions and thoughts about the future of reporting statutes and services to victims that will result. Fraser's first comments criticize the governmental response to Child abuse. To Fraser, this criticism relates not only to child abuse but to any major problem that continues over time Fraser's criticism is an open critique of American institutions. In \u00b7the child abuse arena, this means that the federal government has spent time and money on demonstration projects that are proven neither effective nor ineffective. These projects, and related resea.rch efforts and programs within individual states, continue to be funded because \"there is a belief that these dive~se programs will \\rnagically coalesce at some future point in time. II (f Fraser views this amalgam of services as ineffective if we WiS)l to de-. ve1.op a coordinated, comprehensive national program to combat child abuse and neglect. In fact, Fraser sees this scattershot approach to the problem as a failur,e. Fraser also addresses the definition of child abuse: ., !the term child abuse has a much broader meaning. It is a generic term. In the simplest of terms, it is damage to a child for 'i.1hich there is no reasonable .explanation. Child abuse is usually not a single-physical attack or a single act of molesta\u00ad tion or deprivation. It is typically a pattern of behavior. Its effects are curnulati ve. The longer it continues, the\" more serious the damage. -29-a 4. , .. Fraser points out that there are different types of child abuse, which he defines at greater length later in his article. Neglect and emotional abuse cannot be defined absolutely, accord\u00ad ing to Fraser, because they reflect community standards of behav\u00ad ior. Cultural biases and community standards vary geographically and across time. Fraser says that there are four variables which seem to be indigenous to the crime. The first is learned behavior. In most cases of child abuse, one or both of the parents was abused I ne\u00ad glected, or deprived as a child. T~e second factor is p~rental isolation. The parents may be physl,cally or culturally ~solated. They have no friends or relatives upon whom to call in times of crisis. Third, the parents usually have unrealistic expectations for their children. Fourth, there is usually a crisis of some sort which precedes and precipitates an abusive incident. When these four factors coalesce, child abuse is very likely to 'occur. In light of the tremendous amount of child abus7 tha~ oc~urs every year in this country, Fraser suggests that leg~slat~on ~n\u00ad tended to prevent or treat the problem mus~ t~ke into ac~o~nt the sheer impossibility of anticipating every ~nc~dent of ch~la abuse. He calls legislation that requires treatment \"for every abused child and his paren'ts, when no resources exist, [as] shortsighted and self-defeating-.II Child abuse is such a complicated issue that only a multidisciplinary approach is likely to ameliorate the problem. In terms of approaches to the problem, Fraser identifies three major areas of effort: /,: identification of the child alleged. to have been abused; investigation to determine if the allegat~ons are indeed true; and delivery of services and treatment to both the . child and his family. Fraser views the current child abuse syste'p as remedial in the sense that it deals wit,h the child only after /' he has been abused. All resources are al,lqcated toward efforts. to treat abuse that already has been infl~cted, and Fraser sees that as a shortsighted approach to the prob~,em. , In addressing identification, Fraser concentrates on rep~rting statutes. All states now have such statutes, as we have ment~oned. The question is how well they are being utilized. Are mandated re\u00ad porters really reporting? Are there sanctions against those man~ dated reporters who have been proven not to be reporting? Fras7r notes that almost all reporting statutes concentrate on profess~onals who should report. But, Fraser mentions, most child abuse reports come from non-professionals, such as next-door ne~ghb07s: He ,argues that the general public must be made aware of the~r ab~l~t\u00a5 to re\u00ad port, if not their responsibility to do so. Many author~t~es agree that neighbors and relatives are the first to become aware of abuse, and therefore should be encouraged to bring this to the attention of the auth(.)ri ties. II Nonprofesf;iionals'are' not among manda;ted reporters under Illi\u00ad nois law, but reports ,still have greatly increased. What we do not know is the proportion of reports from mandated versus nonmandated -30-reporters, because as the new reporting laws have gone into effect, a general awareness of child abuse reporting has occurred among mem\u00ad bers of the general public. So, though there has been an increase in reporting since the statute has been amended to include more professional mandated reporters, non-professionals may also be re\u00ad sponding to the intent of the law. Certainly recent efforts by DCFS to educate the public by plac\u00ad ing advertising in public places and on television and radio will increase reporting among non-professionals. Also, efforts by DCFS to make professional reporting responsibilities clear in the past year should have effected an increase in reports among professionals. Fraser devotes a small amount of space to a description of the investigation of a child abuse case. He mentions that normally, a local representative of a state department of social services is required to investigate any reported case of child abuse. We will see later that there are exceptions to this general rule. Never\u00ad theless, a social worker is the person most likely to respond to a report. The type of investigation produced will almost invar\u00ad iably come from a social-work point of view, which usually is non\u00ad criminal in nature, even though in most states child abuse is a crime. This is an: important issue that we will discuss in detail as the report progresses. Fraser makes the following interesting observation about the investigation phase of child abuse response: \"The investigation which focuses on the reported injury creates a still life portrait of the child at the time the report was received. The proper investigation needs to focus on the child's life, not on a single event. The proper ~nvestigation should create a moving picture of the child's life.- Fraser says the best investigations occur as the result of coordinated efforts in which agencies complement one another. The pooling of expertise among professionals is presented as a key to a successful investigation. The next category that Fraser addresses is titled \"intervention\" and refers, simply, to implementation of a treatment plan. Of course, in reality, several steps intervene between the child abuse investigation and the implementation of treatment. The most impor\u00ad t~nt of those steps involves the courts. We will describe these steps within the context 'of all of the case studies that follow. Fraser refers to federal initiatives, most specifically the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, signed into law by,the President-:on January 31, 1974 (\\42 U. S .C. ~~ 5101-5107). The Act allocates' funds for distribution to the states for prevention and treatment of child abuse. Funds are distributed through a formula that has changed over the years. Fraser includes a brief history of reporting statutes, a por\u00ad tion of which is worth quoting at length: -31- ~--~ ----- ~hefirst generation of reporting statutes had a rather simple focus. Their purpose was to mandate certain professionals to report suspected cases of child abuse. It was an identification function. It was believed that if a case of suspected child abuse could be identified and funneled into the system, appropriate relief would be provided. It was an erroneous assumption. As a result, a second generation of reporting statutes began to emerge. The focus of these statutes was identification and investigation. It was believed that, if the needs were clearly established, existing. agencies would provide the appropriate relief. That too proved to be an erroneous assumption. As a result, a third generation of reporting statutes began to emerge. In addition to identification and investigation, these statutes began to address the complex issues of intervention. These statutes began to address the issues of limited resources, limited expertise, lack of coordination, a need to involve the general public as well as professionals, and the need to es\u00ad tablish a planning component. Fraser then runs through the typical reporting statute item by item, starting with definitions--again. The definition section is important because it establishes parameters and because this section must be broad enough to cover several types of very dis\u00ad similar behaviors. Most states refer to'accidental vs. non-accidental injuries. Many statutes specifically refer to corporal punishment. Fraser states that corporal punishment is by definition inflicted non\u00ad accidental physical injury. No state, however, prohibits the use of corporal punishment by parents. The issue rests on what typ:=s and amounts of punishment are reasonable. Some stat.es have been concerned with the distinction between non-accidental physical ~n\u00ad jury and corporal punishment and have attempted to distingqish. ~~~\u00ad tween the two in their statutes. Four states specifically perm; It reasonable corporal punishment and state that it is not child abuse. On the other hand, four other states categorize exceSSIve corporal punishment as child abuse. Almost. all reporting statutes also mention neg:lect in specific terms. Fraser states that there have arisen two schools of thought concerning standards for definitions of neglect. The first is that a cllild is entitled to \"the care and support that a reasonably prudent parent might provide.\" The second is that a parent must only provide the minimum amount of care acceptable within the com\u00ad munity. Obviously, thj,s has to be viewed as a community-based\" , issue. Fraser indicates that the \"real standard\" fluctuates from community to community. Fraser mentions that some, but not all, states includ~ sexual molestation within thei;,:\" definitions of child abuse. The problem is that there are many types of sexual molestation, as we detail\" in our Child Molestation report', and some are closely related to abuse, while others clearly are unrelated to what is normally con\u00ad strued as being child abuse. -32-I ~ '. Fraser also refers to a category that we encountered upon occasion during our investigation and which is receiving increas\u00ad ing interest from social workers and others. It is the area of emotional abuse or mental injury. Fraser's comments on this cate\u00ad gory are valuable: As early as 1958 it was suggested that mental injury should be included in any definition of child abuse. The sarne suggestion has been echoed by various commentators for the last twenty years. There is little doubt that physical trauma or a hostile psy\u00ad chological environment can cause mental injury. There is equally little doubt that the mental injury can be quite severe and the effec\u00b7ts can have a pronounced effect in later years. It cannot, however, be said with any surety that a hostile or neglectful envirorunent will result in mental in\u00ad jury. And this has prompted at least one commentator to sug\u00ad gest that mental injury and possible intervention should be \" premised solely on damage to a child\" and not on a harm\u00ad ful environment which might result in psychological damage and mental injury. In the remainder of this report, we will describe specific case studies of child abuse and neglect, abuse and neglect which ended in death, and intrafamilial child sexual abuse. The cases are intended to illustrate the child abuse system, including its strengths and weaknesses. They also provide insight into how the system is meant to function. Areas not covered within the context of specific cases will also be described in the report. Family violence will not go away. It is our responsibility to develop recommendations for the development ang implementation of the most efficient and effective instruments to limit violence within both the family and society. -33--~-----~-- ~~---- ,f r r\u00b7 \\ G ii, i , --------- . Chapter 2 THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES Illinois> law names DCFS as the state agency solely responsible for protecting children. Besides child protection, the Department also provides services involving family maintenance, sUbstitute care, adoption, child and family development, unmarried mothers, and youth development. As of June 30, 1982, DCFS had open cases . representing approximately 23, 000 children (see Figure 2-l). 'l'he Department served these children through its eight regio~al and 73 Services Offices (see Figure 2-2 for.a map of the regio,ns). Por Fiscal Year 1982, the General'Assembly appropriated $158.5 million to the Department, making its General F.evenue Fund budget the 5th ampng comparative State code departments. 'A~ History The earliest predecessor to the Department of Children and Family Services was created in 1905 by the Legislature under the Visitation of Children in Homes Act. The Department of Visitation of Children was charged with visiting all dependent and delinquent children placed in foster homes and institutions and with inspecting these institutions annually. The Department was a division of the State Board of Public Charities, and served a much narrower purpose than today's DCFS: to oversee the care of \"that class of children who are subject to abuse and brutal treatment at the hands of foster parents, as is sometimes the case ...... The Department of Visitation became a division of the Department of Public Welfare when that Department was created in 1917. In 1929 a Governor's commission recommended that a Division of Child Welfare be established in the Department of Public\u00b7 ,Welfare to perform the visiting duties of the Division of Visitation of Children, and to license, set s,)tandards for, and supervise public and private agencies caring for children. The) Commission also recommended that the\" new Division clearly sf3parate its case\\'{,ork and supervisory responsibilities. ~ . . At about the same time, the philosophy' behind the commission's recommendations was also eXpressed at the 1930 White House Conference on Children~ (President Theodore RooseVelt held the first White House Con,ference on Children in 1909, which called for the nation to preserve and'strengtpen horne life for children. The conferences are held every \u00b0 ten years.) The 1930 conference emphasized the need for stat,e welfare departments to e:;;tablish standards for all child\" care agencies. At the White House Conference, states were directed to provide \"leadership, guidanpe, and direction to social work programs. \" ' . These sentiments 'led the Illinois Legislature to pass the Placement of Children in Homes Act (also known as the Child Welfare Act) on July 10, 1933.; This act repealed the Visitation Act of -35'\" ' , Preceding page blank Ii , Regional Map Illinois Depart ment of Children and Family Sa . rYleeS Figure 2-2 Stars indicate rcgi I \" ona headquarters. -36-' l r , i I ,i I I \u00b7Ii' t '; \" !: I, , i. \" lit I \\) ~ Figure 2-1 If , II Open child Cases by Sub-State Regions Fiscal Years 1981 -1983 :'!

The legislation became effective January 1, 1964. The new department was to run most of the non-psychiatric programs and services to children forme'rly administered by the Department of Mental Health. The Division of Child Welfare's licensing duties were also transferred to DCFS. DCFS' current legal. authority comes from the Child Care Act of 1969. For a discussion of this and other acts related to chi~d protection, see Chapter 3. B. The Department's Organization Currently, DCFS has five divisions: Child Protection, Management and Budget, Policy and Plans, Program Operations, and Youth and Community Services. (See Figure 2-3.) The Division of Child Protection, created last year, will be our main focus in this chapter. The division is responsible for the statewide toll-free child abuse and neglect hotline, the State Central Register of abuse and neglect reports, child abuse and neglect investigations, internal security investigations, and licensing. In this chapter's section on child protection, we will discuss all these functions except internal security investigations. The Division of Management and Budget, as DCFS' 1983 Human Services Plan put it, supports the Department and its services areas by directing administrative management and fiscal activities of the Department. Included in this D~vision are the functional offices of Budgeting, Financial Management, Information Services, Financial Policy and Systems Design, Contracts/Grants, Affirmative Action, Employee/ Labor Relations, Children's Financial Benefits, and Central Support Services. Of these functions, we will discuss only Cont.!'acts/Grants. The Division of Policy and Plans is responsible for overall policy and program development, planning, staff training, and administrative case review. Administrative case review oversees DCFS' progress toward its permanency planning goals. One of DCFS' major initiatives for FY 1982 was to develop and implement permanency planning and case review system!; ~n accordance with the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (P.t. 96~272) to prev~nt unnecessary placement of children, reunify families or provide children who have been placed in sub\u00ad stitute care with permanent, secure and nurturing living arratlge\u00ad ments. This is according to the Human Services Plan, which goes on to say that the case revi~w system will \"review cases of all children in substitute care every six months. The case reviews will be con\u00ad ductedby the Permanency Adyocates [now called case review administrators] and will be open to the participation of parents.\" \u00b7'39-\" , r r r .t\u00ad O , Dlvllion \", Odld Protection I Office of Comrnunlutlan Figure 2-3 Department of Children and Family Servh:ea Office of UjIIIIs.mc .. /;-\",Olvlslon of DIRECTOR Grepy L.

The Division of Program Operations \"performs the vital func- .' tion of direct management and supervision of the eight DCFS regions .'1' The division al'so includes the management offices for Program Service Administration, Support Services, and Adoption Services. Later in this chapter, we will discuss the family ma;i.ntenance and substitute pare services provided by the eight regions, as well as the adoption services provided statewide. Included under tpe Adoption Services Unit's administration is the Adoption Information Center of Illinois, opened in March of 1981. Organized in dc\u00b7tober of 1981, the Division of Youth and Community Services was created to., serve Illinois' troubled adoles\u00ad cents by forging a coherent strategy from several fragmented programs. The Division is divided into four offices: Management Resources, Governor's Youth ,., Services Ini tia ti ve, Community Services Integration, and Field Services Management. Management Resources handles the Division's financial affairs. The Governor's Youth Services Initiative is explained in the 1983 Human Services Plan: This program, which began in 1979 as the Governor's Cook County Court Project, was designed expressly to serve youth with multiple problems. By combining and coordinating the resources and services of four state agencies, the Initiative develops individualized treatment plans for youth who formerly \"fell between the cracks\" of state agency mandates. Participating agencies are DCFS, the Illinois State Board of Education, the Department of Mental Health/Develop\u00ad mental Disabilities and the Department of Corrections. The Initiative operates in Cook County and three downstate regions: Champaign, E. St. Louis and Peoria. Currently youth in\"need of the Initiative!s services are identified and referred by the Juvenile,. Court. The Initiative accepts refer\u00ad rals on a no-decline pasis when they need one or m9re of the fol\u00ad lowing criteria: All regular channels to services have been exhausted. There is a major disagreement between the court and a state agency as to that state agency's responsibility for a child or as to tpe type of service the child is to receive. There is a major disagreement betweBn state agencies as to which agency is responsible for service delivery or as to the type of service the child is to receive. The majority of referrals to the Initiative are multi-problem delin\u00ad quents, but since!OOst ar,~ non-violent offenders, judges are reluctant to incarcetate them. Most youth referred to the Initiative also are inappropriate for mental health hospitalization. After receipt of the referral, the Governor's Initiative Regional Coordinator convenes an interagency staffing. As the youth's holistic needs are identifiept interim and long-term service -41..---------~----------------------- .. ~---- recommendations are formulated. A comprehensive service plan then is developed that includes arrangements for residential placement, continuous project staffing, on-going direct contact with the youth and his/her family, guardian and service provider. The project served 106 youths in FY 1981. ,The project is expected to serve approximately the same number in FY 1982 and FY 1983. Community Services Integration is currently a one~person office responsible for division planning. Field Services Management absorbed the functions of the commission,on belinquency Prevention, including administering such youth serv~ces as t~e, Illinois Status Offender Service and the Office of Youth Tra~n~ng and Employment. Also, this office recently took over the operation of Unified Delinquent Intervention Services (UDIS) from the Department of Corrections. We will now discuss in greater detail those functions of DCFS that most directly affect abused and neglected children. Th~ugh our discussion will center around the Division of Child Protection', it will touch on the divisions of Management and Budget, Policy and Plans, and Program Operations. This c~apter sh?uld.be rea~ ~s general background to our case are r~ch ~n spec~f~c information about how DCFS operates. C. Division of Child Protection In August, 1981, DCFS announced that it ha~ created a ne~ Child Protection division, although implementat~on had begun ~n the Chicago Region early that Spring. The new division b:ouf.;iht together Child'Protective Services, the State Central Reg-:ster, and licensing, all of which had previously been under Reg~ona,l control wi thin the Division of Program Operations. DCP would,\u00b7 .also be responsible for Inte-:rnal Security Investigations, which ha~~ been performed by the Office of Investigations, independent of any division. The Internal Security Investigations section employs three investigators who investigate DCFS employee misconduc:t, often in cooperation with the Department of Law Enfor~ement: I~ternal Security Investigations is not relevant to our ~nvest~gat~on. We will, however, discuss the State Central Register, Child Abuse! Neglect Investigations, and Licensing in detail. 1. The State Central Register: A Child Abuse/Neglect Tracking System Before DCFS can help an abusive or neglectful family, .the Deoartment must be told about the problem. DCFS cannot see through th~ walls of Illinois homes, so it depends on reports from doctors, teachers, relatives, neighbors, and others to learn of abuse or neglect. Once an incident has been :eport7d, ~CFS must kee~ a record of the report and subsequent ~nvest~gat~on. DCFS tr~es to Jreach two Com\u00ad pleteness means re<;:e'i ving reports on as many of Illinois' child maltreatment in.cidents'as possible, while coordination means -42-r ~ r f ! t i\" F r Ii F { I J.i , ~ J I tt ! ~ ,~ ~i I 1 ',4 ,j I :j .l 1 ,.~ J ;\\ 'l 'J 1 't ~ 1 ~~ JI . ~ .~ 1 \\ , keeping track of proven abusers even if the family moves or years pass between incidents. TO improve DCFS' ability to meet these two goals, Public Act 81-1077 was passed and became effective July 1, 1980. The Act required the creation of a statewide reporting hotline: There shall be a single State-wide, toll-free telephone number established and maintained by the Department which all persons, whether or not mandated by law, may use to report known or sus\u00ad pected child abuse or neglect at any hour of the day or night, on any day of the week. Immediately upon receipt of such reports, the Department shall transmit the contents of the report, either orally or electronically, to. the appropriate Child Pr.otectiveServ:ice Unit. Any other person may use the State-wide number to obtain assistance or information concerning the handling of abuse and neglect cases. The Act also required an automated, computerized Child Abuse Register, which would be used to determine whether a reported victim had been abused before and to monitor the progress of protectiVe services cases The new register and hotline, then, would perform the four functions identified in a 1978 Chicago Kent Law Review article by Douglas J. Besharov, at that time Director of the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect. Besharov writes that an upgraded central register can: 1. Facilitate management planning by providing statistical data on the characteristics of reported cases and their handling; 2. Assist assessments of danger to children by providing or locating information on prior reports and prior treatment efforts; 3. Encourage reporting of known and suspected child abuse and neglect by providing a convenient hotline for reporting, by providing a focus for publip and professional education campaigns, and by providing convenient consultation to caseworkers and potential reporters; and 4. Sharpen child protective accountability by monitoring follow-up reports. Before we describe how the new system performs these four functions, we will see what led to the passage of Public Act 81-1077. a. Background to the New System In December, 1979, after Public Act 81-1077 had been passed, DiBernardo Management Consultants wrote a report for DCFS -43-----~~--- ~---- -----~-~- ---- ~~ --~~~ discussing the implementation of a new child abuse tracking system. The report provides some background information on the State Central Register: since the passage of the first child abuse .and neglect legislation in Illinois in 1965, a State Central Register (SCR) has operated within thefD~partment of Children and Family Services. Prior to the passage-of P.A. 8l-l077,the duties of the SCR were limited in scope and involved primarily recording reports of suspected abuse and neglect, providing information to Departmental staff related to p:r;ior reports of abuse and neglect, and preparing statistical summaries of child abuse and neglect reporting in Illinois. The narrow statistical purpose of the register kept it from being of much use to the 18 area offices (DCFS reorganized its 18 areas .. into 8 regions in the swnmer of 1978). Thus, the area offices kept their own card files of cases. Reports were received by over seventy field offices. This system, with each field office receiving its own reports, was in place when we began our investigation. We soon heard many com\u00ad plaints about the Information and Referral (I & R) workers who answered hotline calls. These I & R workers forwarded reports to Area multi-service workers, to CPS Intake, or directly to a CPS geographical team. Doctors, social workers, policemen, and school principals described DCFS' I & R staff as inexperienced workers who screened all but the most severe incidents. Several of the professionals also complained about DCFS' slow response to accepted reports. One hospital's assistant direc,tor of social services told us he was never sure that the I & R workers were taking down his information, and felt as though DCFS did not want his input. The'~ coordinator of another hospital's child abuse program said the I & R telephone workers were usually not ski.lled social workers experienced in working with child abuse, yet they determined whether or not DCFS accepted a case. The coordinator went on to say that I & R workers conunonly re.fused failure-to-thrive and medical neglect caseS because they were \"not.severe enough,\" even though the reporting act requires that these\" cases be referred to DCFS' Child Protective Services unit. A soci,al worker and two physicians at another hospitCl,l echoed these complaints, saying that not only were some serious cases refused, but ,an attitude of \"why are you calling UE1?\"\" came across the phone. They said that in one instance, the case of a child with gonorrhea was not accepted by DCFS because of lack of severity. Another time, one of the doctors tried to call DCFS for four hours before anyone answered. At another hospital, a medical social worker supervisor recommended that I & R staff be more qualified and experiepced. A physician there told us that whenever he reported an abuse case, the DCFS worker would give him the impres\u00ad sion that \"it's a 'chore' that we've delegated to the State. \" He -44-\\ I ! \\\\ also complained that when DCFS did act on a case, the caseworkers never told the hospital anything about what was done. Because hospital staff never heard anything about what DCFS did for mal\u00ad treated children, they were unenthusiastic about reporting cases to the Department. At two other hospitals, social workers told us they sometimes dissuaded doctors from reporting a case because if DCFS rejected it, the hospital would have hurt its relationship with the family for nothing. Another hospital's social worker supervisor said that in the past, DCFS caseworkers hadn't always come to the hospital, instead doing everything over the phone, but that having a DCFS liaison assigned to the hospital had helped. A medical center's emergency department social worker described DCFS' reluctance to work ona case, saying it took a lot of prod\u00ad ding and urging to get DCFS to act. The social worker said the medical center's Suspected Child Abuse and Neglect (SCAN) team had helped push DCFS into action. One hospital's director of social services bluntly stated, \"Any call to DCFS is just a fiasco.\" The director of conununity services coordination for Calumet City's Youth and Family Services made the same complaints we'd heard at the hospitals. He stated that DCFS hotline workers were not capable of answering or referring callers. He also said that the hotline workers restrict the cases DCFS will respond to, demanding expert witnesses i, opinions before they act. School personnel also complained about DCFS' reponse to child abuse and neglect reports. An elementary school principal and teacher told us the DCFS hotline did not live up to its name-\u00ad that several follow-up calls were\u00b7 often necessary before a DCFS worker would visit the school. They also complained that the telephone intervie,'17s, were too long; the I & R worker would ask about 25 questions. As hospital personnel did, these school personnel complained that they received no information once DCFS took over the case. The director of pupil personnel services for East St. Louis' Board of Education told us DCFS was not as willing to act on neglect reports as on severe abuse reports. He said he had taken many cases of truancy to court himself in order to have the court force DCFS into some kind of action. Although some hospttals and schools said they had no problems wi th DCFS' response to abuse reports ~~\" most complained of delays, unreasonably strict screening of calls, and lack of feedback once DCFS had taken the case. These problems led professionals to .. feel as though DCFS wasn't worth calling at all. We alsa heard complaints from police officers. A Calumet city youth officer criticized the workers who took calls on the -45- local hotline, saying that getting tqem to accept a case became \"a game of who can outdo the other with words.\" He explained that because the intake workers were not properly trained, or qualified in the first place, they either gave the caller a dose of doubletalk or transferred the call to an equally unqualified worker. The commander of the Peoria Police Department's Juvenile Bureau also complained that one of the,bureau's biggest problems with DCFS was simply gettingcasewerkers te respend. The cemplaints we heard in interview~ were supperted by findings we read in reperts. Professienals teld us I & R werkers accepted neglect cases rel.uctantly, preferring clear-c::ut cases .of severe abuse.. The American Humane Assecia tien. (AHA), in: its feund that The Department err~hasis on response to abuse reports has resulted in dilution of services to neglected children. The:present organizational structure does not assure equal protection of children reported as neglected under the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act. The AHA also criticized DCFS! system .of coerdinating and tracking cases: Fragmentation of the flow and processing of neglect and abuse cases arising from the present organizational framework results in built-in weaknesses and inefficiencies which seriously impair the ability of the Department to provide quality protective services. In 1979, H. Frederick Brown and fellow researchers at the uni versi ty of Illinois' Jane Addams College of Social Work sub- '\" mitted to the Illinois Law Enforcement Cemmissien a report entit~ ~~d, \"Policies and Practices of the Pretective Se.rvices System ih , Cook ,County. \" Brewn and his associates found several problems . with DCFS reports and records. Data checks were not consistent .or cemplete. Brewn explains what a data check is fer: \"Following the telephone report of the abuse .or neglect, CPS Intake will make a data check of any prior histery with the family.\" In examining 882 child abuse and neglect case legs, Brewn found that data checks were dene for only 53.4% .of the reports. The State Central Registry was consulted in .only 22.3% .of the cases, the EPS-l file (a manual file of all Cook County Intake Forms fer the past twe or three years) in 18.5% of the cases, the computer printout and terminal of all active DCFS cases in 14.5% of ~e cases, and the Guardianship File in,.30.1% .of the cases. Brewn writes, Clearly, the information sources available to workers are inadequate to meet the need fdr a quick accurate history of prior abuse/neglect reports and/or current involvement with the Department. The ,agency's gomputerized information system is especially cumbersome. First, it -46- G ., -------------------- is not functional after hours, when over 40 percent of the CPS reports come in. Even more important, it is not accessible unless the worker alre~dy knows the number assigned the opened case; this is impossible when the call first comes in. If the system were based on retrieval of cases by names of children, parents, or their addresses, it would greatly enhance the possibility of obtaining . what prior information exists. Since 46 percent of all reports occur after hours, the availability of the computerized case Jnfor- mation at these times is critical. ' 'I The professienals we interviewed also claimed that inex\u00ad perienced I & R werkers screened reports toe strictly. Brown found that approximately '''ene-fifth of the abuse/neglect reports received by CPS are clesed at the Intake stage, usually witheut benefit of an in-person investigation.\" Brewn lists eleven reasons workers give fer clesing a case at intaker and then .observes, '! some are clearly more appropriate t\\han others.\" Two .of the weakest reasens, in Brewn's opinion, are denial of the allegation by the suspected perpetrater (usually over the phone) and questions raised about the reporter's credibility. In Brown's sample, 25.8% of the cases clesed at intake were clesed because the reporter's credibility was questioned. (These weak reasons may, hewever, have been given in combinatien with others.) Brown and his associates recornmend that \"Definite guidelines be established for clesing cases at intake without further investi-gation.\" . Brown alse mentiens the intake workers' lack of experience, \\~(~~: ~. suggesting that the situation may be improving: '\\\\ o '\\ Considerable effort has gone into iIl\\Proving intake procedures in \\\\ Child Protective Services., subse~u. ent to the .reorganization fol- \\ co,\" lowing the recommendations of tnl'e American Humane Association '~~~ponsultation. Until recently th~ Intake Unit was the only CPS '\\. ~it which had Social Worker I positions where Social Worker II '\\'J.~ositions were required in all other units. 'Upgrading personnel ,;, in the Intake Unit may also be indicated. \" Hospi tal and schoel persennel criticized DCFS\" slow table in suppert ofll . this criticism, pointing .out that in 38.7% of these cases, ;in.l:\\ persen contact teek place a week or mere, after the report. ' I],'~inois law required that in all cases, DCFS \"shall initiate an invest':t\u00ad gation within 24 hours.\" Because this deadline clearly was . not being met in many' cases, Brown and his asseciates recommended that \"In-persen centacts be required within 72 hours .of r~cEdpt .of initial report.\" . -47-,. \" \\ ., I ~~-~---~'-....------ --------------- First In-perso~ Investigation ., Received of Follow-up Ca'ses Number of Days after Report Percent One Day or Less 15.0% (53) Two Days 15.5% (55) Three Days ~, 15.5% (55) Four Days to One Week 15.3% (54) Eight Days to Two Weeks 17.5% (62) Over Two Weeks 21.2% \" (75) \" 100.0% (354) (Timing unknown = 35) Brown also discusses problems wfth DCFS' case records. In choosin.g his sample, Brown had to delete over a hundre8)cases out of a thousa~nd because \"they lacked essential identifying information and would be untraceable.\" He. then writes, no -record could be located or no follow-up recording had been done in 55 of the 148 cases in the sample that reached the follow\u00ad up stage, although all likely locations within CPS and the ~our DCFS Area offices were searched at least once. the case records themselves led to some problems of consistency since they contain several different data sources completed at various, stages and by several different administrative units. Besides these problems with the investigativ~ records, Brown encountered problems with the s,ervice deli very records: ' Information about services was gathered from case records of open cases, supplemented by ~~terviews wi~ caseworkers when a record was not available or, info~tion was known to be missing. DUe to extreme work load pressure anSi the emergency nature of much that' must be done, it ,is probable that CPS workers do not consistently record all ongoing casework or case management services. 'Thus i., our picture is incomplete. '. r I: In the final chapter of thisl979 report, Brown looks forward to the arrival of anew state~wide reporting system: , Q Possibly the most encompassing piece of legislation to be Vassed and signed by the governor that will influence services to these children is Senate Bill 973 co-sponsored by Senators [Kenneth v.l Buzbee and [Richard ~.] Daley. This legislation, with its required state-wide reporting and monitoring system, will require major reorganization. During this current year (1979) the s~ate is .. -48- ..; \\1 , I \\ j- I I placing theimplemen\"cation of this legislation as their top priority. If this neW systeli!, as provided in that legislation, can be made to work, many of the problems pointed up\u00b7 in this research report will become more manageable. Hgwever, he is cautiousl:f optimistic about the new ,system: \\\\ ~ It is not clear that the new ~ystem will be able to develop a case monitoring system which can provide immediate information as to the status of any case, that is being handl~ by IDCF,S. Although the new system will comprise both manual anq\\computer systems for monitori~,c;J'CA/~ reports, there will continue \\Ito be problems in ,the areas of handling the flow and use of case rec.:ords by CPS '>1orkers. . ~ The present system of assigned case records befng stored in desks of case workers or supervisors makes loca ting ca'si:~, records most difficult f01;\" researchers or intake worke:es who are respond,ing to subsequent repo'rts O:f abuse/neglect. The research proj~ct acknowledges the necessity of the case workers and the superviso:r;:s to have easy access to these records assigned to them, but a better control system needs tqbe devised. b. The New System In October of 1979, DCFS began a pilot hotline system down\u00adstate, and by July of 1980 had established:: the system statewide Before the new system was installed, files took as long, as three months to update and there was almost no way to establish links between cases. \"F~ilies could \"hospi tal shop\"--take their abused children to different hospitals to avoidqetection. And if families moved from one region to another', their. abuse records didn I t move with them. With the new statewide hotline and computerized central registry, coordination is grea~ly enhanced. Hotline social workers can receive a call in springfield, type'the family's name into the computer, and immediately learn if there have been previous inci\u00ad dents of abuse or neglect. The worker ~akes down information about the present report on a Child Abuse/Negle'ct Tracking System (CANTS) form. The worker then phones this information to the appropriate regional offige and enters .it on the compute,r's files. On IJecember 29, 1980, one of our investigators visited the State Central Regis,ter in Springfield, whert?;, hotline calls are received~ ',' He intervi~wed William Ryan, \"Assistant Deputy Director of Program Operations, and Dennis Stuckey, Administrator of the State Central Register. Ryan and Stuckey toldou~ inv~stigato-t that they anticip\u00a3~ed receiving, 80 to 90 thousand' calls per year 1 one-thiJ::,dof whichwouJ.d lead to investigations. Of the calls that \"were investigated,about 60% would p'rove unfounded. Thus, only about one-seventh of the, calls would lead to founded abuse or neglect reports. '\\, ' , -49-a 4\" ~' I & $$C .. \" -- Ryan and Stuckey suspected, as we had, that before the imple\u00ad mentation of the statewide hotline, regional personnel were screening less serious heglect allegations and focusing on abuse. Ryan told us that the workers taki.ng calls now were all Social Worker lIs, and that 90% had field experience. But although the workers were more experienced, questions abqut definition and jurisdiction remained, according to Ryan. For example, should DCFS invest:igate cases of educational neglect? And is it medical neglect when parents fail to have their children innoculated? Stuckey described the record-keeping prior to the automated registry as \"unbelievably bad,\" with no way for Springfield to know how many child abuse reports were actually being received. Ryan and Stuckey explained that the system was designed to be easily expanded as the number of calls increases over time. Shortly after the hotline was implemented statewide, fewer calls were being received than had been expected, which was fortunate because calls were taking longer to answer than had been predicted. DCFS had anticipated calls averaging eight minutes J,?ng, but eight\u00ad minute calls proved rare; they were only that short \\~'hen a reporter had all the necessary information at his or her fingertips. To handle busy periods, cRyan borrowed an idea from police departments: the \"power shift.\" The hotline has five eight-hour shifts; overlaps cover the busy hours. After a telephone worker receives a call and decides it should be investigated, she or he calls the regional office and gives it the information. The worker then submits the information to the Computer Entry unit where the workers keypunch in the report. On the following day, the hard copy is mailed to the regional office where the investigation is being conducted. DCFS initially planned to install CRT printers in the regional offices to avoid tying up caseworkers on the phone. However, the funds for this project were cut from the budget and a printer was not installed in Chicago until April of 1981. Presently 86% of the reports received by the SCR are transmitted to local offices over CRTs . Monitoring case determinations is one of the duties performed by the Central Register's two midnight shift workers. If a case. determination of \"unfounded\" seems inconsistent with the in.juries described in the initial re.port, the case is sent back to the caseworker. Besides rece1v1ng maltreatment reports anq monitoring case determinations, Central Register workers counsel parents who call the hotline because they fear they are about to abuse their children. In a December 29, 1980 Chicago Tribune article, Gregory Coler is quoted on the hotline's .contributions to child abuse prevention: Coler said the \"most exciting thing\" about the hot line is the fact that a growing number of adults are phoning when they feel they are -50-about to hurt their. children. \"Sometimes we talk people out of hurting their kids right on the spot,\" he said. We tried to discover how many calls the Central Register receives from potentially abusive parents. A DCFS pamphlet states that the hotline can and has prevented potential cases of abuse. This happens when a \"self-referral\" call comes in. For example, a distraught mother, under heavy stress, will call to warn that she fears she is about to abuse her child. \"We get about 70 of these self-referral calls a month and can take immediate preventive action,\" says Mr. Ryan. During the composition of this report, we spoke to the Register's Hector Caldera about self-referrals. He told us that in Fiscal Year 1981, 344 of the 20,908 reports to the hotline were from the victims themselves. In FY 1982, 353 victims reported. But Caldera could not tell us how many potential.ly abusive parents had called the hotline. Although the registry keeps track of how many ~others and fathers call the hotline, it doesn't keep track of how many of those parents called because they were about to hurt their children. Caldera told us he spoke with his supervisor after our inqui.ry, and they are considering tallying parents' self-referrals from now on. While visiting the Central Register, one of our investigators spoke with three workers, each of whom seemed dedicated and enthusiastic about his or her work. They said that stress was not a problem p though Ryan had said it was. In 1980, Ryan was also worried about the possibility of harass\u00ad ment calls: people reporting their neighbors out Qf spi\u00b7te. Ryan guessed that one or two percent of their present calls were harass\u00ad ment calls. Ryan also wondered if parents who were competing for custody of their children might call in to report each other. T~e system has since expanded its line capacity from 10 to 13 lines. Stuckey said that in the past six months, callers have received busy signals only once or twice. There are times when callers are put on automatic hold because all the workers are busy, but they have been wnrking on keeping this to a minimum by making return calls following peak periods when the situation permits it. He stated that they receive an average of 350 calls on weekdays and 150 toc200 a day on weekends. The new hotline has received a fair amount of attention in\"the press. On June 29, 1980, the Chicago Tribune carried a two-page article that said the computerized reporting network was \"considered the most advanced in the nation\" and quoted an official in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as saying, \"It's pointing in the::.cdirectian we'd like al-1 :the states to go.\" In February of 1982, articles appeared in both the Tribune and the Sun-Times describing DCFS' case backlog. The Sun-Times article -51-I i' ~~---------- ~ ----~------------------------------------------------------~------------~i~.-------- reported that the Cook County backlog reached 1,200 cases in July. In about 400 of the cases, investigation was not begun within 24 hours. In about 325 of the cases, the legal time limits were met. And in the remaining 475 cases were described by a DCFS deputy director, Michael Tristano, as \"'lightweight', such as educational abuse, and 'logical to be put on the back burner. '\" Th~ article ties the backlog to the new hotline: \"DCFS said the backlog developed when investigators were overwhelmed by calls with the implementation~Q~ July 1, 1980, of a toll-free telephone 'h()t line' to report abuse,\\\"~d neglect. II \\. \",,' In August of 1982, we spoke again with personnel from three hospitals we had contacted earlier in our investigation asking them to comment on current DCFS response. All three said DCFS resPOnse had improved under the new hotline. To improve the flow and coordination of records, DCFS is working on merging its three management information system: CANTS, MARS, and CyeIS. DCFS describes this merger in its 1981 annual report, issued in the summer of 1982: This effort got underway when CANTS-;-the Child Abuse and Neglect Tracking System--went into effect July 1, 1980. Linked with the hotline and State Central Register, CANTS has exclusive use of an IBM 8100 computer. The computer records and stores all basic information on prior abuse or neglect reports, feeding it back to hotline wqrkers and child abuse investigators responding to new reports. In addition, CANTS also tracks cases, prepares automatic reminders and reports, and generates statistics for use in analysi~,; and research. . The second system to be merged is the Management Accounting and Reporting System (MARS), which will computerize all aspects of DCFS financial management and payment processes. It will include all payments systems, app~opriation accounting, budgeting, contracting, trust accounting, federal funds claiming, and rate setting. In the past, most of these procedures were done manually. The most innovative new system for which the Department is plan~ing is CYCIS--Child and Youth Centered Information System. this system will track the progress of all children in public or private agency care or under juvenile justice jurisdiction. For DCFS workers, CYCIS will improve planning, goal setting, case reviews, and follow-up services. For managers and planners, it will i'1entify trends and bottlenecks and provide a factual., base for testimony to the executive branch and the General Assembly when the Department seeks new or different resources. Planning and programming for MARS and CYCIS proceeded through 1981. When completely linked with CANTS, the system will give DCFS a comprehensive management information system capable of monitoring \"all functions of the agency and tracking all children and facilities served. A pilot project is set to begin in the Springfield -52-f I '::i If ! Region July 1,' 1982, with the rest of the state going on line in (9ptember. DCFS' 1982 Human Services Plan identifies this merger as one of the Department's major initiatives, and lists several benefits of the new coordinated system: A more direct contact between the computer system and the worker by the use of terminals at larger fiel~ offices for data entry and correction. Faster response for turnaround of case documents by using field printers. Standardization of caseworker procedures and reporting. Automatic suspension of payments when licensing and contracting authorization does not match the payment request and faster notification of appropriate personnel when a payment is being suspended due to lack of proper authorization. A comprehensive review of caseworker decision through permanency goal an5l outcome goal achievement monitoring. Potential reduction in the number of eligibility forms since many can be computer generated. Creation of a single integrated file showing all purchased services. This file will assist budgeting, analysis of resources effectiveness and management decision making \" Development of special management reports that highlight exceptions to the norm. We \\>lill now discuss how Illinois' SCR fulfills the four functions described by Besharov. Facilitate management planning Before creating the SCR, DCFS had no way to accurately describe the distribution of child abuse incidents throughout the state. Since all reports now come to the central register the concentration of abuse incidents can be determined with absolute precision. For the first time, DCFS can accurately evaluate personnel needs for both investigation and follow qp on child abuse cases and identify the target problems. For instance, the Department knows on a monthly basis which regions are experiencing problems commencing all of their investigations within 24 hours, what the investigator caseload is by region, etc. Management can now study these devia\u00ad tions to determine the reason for th,e deviation and initiate measures to change them when it is indicated. -53--~~----.-~------ ~.---~- ----- ---.-~ --~-----~ ---\u00b7------------_T~---_\u00b7_. Assist assessments of danger to child~en Previously, the Central Register was so poorly thought of that the Cook Count}~CPS Unit would only query the Register in 22% of the cases they received. The Registe'r was only operating 40 hours a week and required a case number to access. The Department\u00b7 has gone from this part-time, impotent system to a 24-hour, computerized registe~ which can be queried by a variety of mandated reporters with simply the phonetic spelling of a victim or per\u00ad petra,tor's name. Consequently I any past incident of abuse in the family can immediately be determined. Encourages reporting The department has advertised its 24-hour toll-free Hotline number encouraging the public to report information they may have regarding abuse or neglect of children. It was just more than two years ago that mandated reporters telephoning one of the .72 dif\u00ad ferent DCFS offices which received reports, literally had to argue with the DCFS worker to get the worker to take down the information. One can imagine the treatment ordinary citizens received when trying to initiate a case. The Department has reversed from dis\u00ad couraging cases to actively encouraging reporting. Sharpen child protection accountability In the past, CPS wOl:'.kers were assigned to investigate reports of abuse by their supervisors who were supposed to insure that investigations were actua.lly conducted. Frequently supervisors were not diligent in moni~i:.oring their subordinates' activity. The result was that many reports were never investigated and were eventually forgotten. ,) The SCR does not forg\\et. Follow up referrals must be ent ~red into the SCR at specified ~lntervals. If proper follow up infor\u00ad mation is not received, thE~ computer automatically notifies . increasingly higher levels \\of supervision that proper action has not been taken. 'i Our investigators visited the SCR and Hotline on several occasions. We also intervi~~wed other outside officials who had examined the operation, and:.\\inspected Central Registers in other states. It appears that DCElS has planned the hotline well ,=-~c assigning the space and staf\\~ necessary to make i t\u00b7work. The staff seem well trained, eff~cient, and professional. By comparison to Central Registers we 'have:! seen in other states. and certainly by comparison to the way repdlrts previously were handled in Illinois, the Central Register and HotJl,\\,ine is an impressive operation ..

Child Abuse/Neglect Investigations p E R C E N T 0 F T .0 T A L The,Invest~g~t~an~ section of the Division of Child Protection serves as the.d~v~s~on s front line.

Many of the changes that have taken Department attempt to solve the previous problems. -55'\"' :;-\"\", ..... * 44; 4fC = r~ ,~,----------- The cases presented in other chapters of this report all happened under the past system. In order for the reader t~ more fully understand the case studies and the changes that have taken place in the Department, \\\"le offer the follmving background. In the early 1970's, Jerome Miller, Director of DCFS, divided the department into 18 Areas, leaving each Area office to a~inister and provide its own services. Some p~ograms, however, rema1ned centralized, covering the jurisdiction of more than one Area . office. For example, the child abuse program for East St. LOU1S, set up by Jeanine Smith, coordinated CPS in the various East St. Louis Area offices. Smith was transferred to Cook County to set up a similar program, and in 1975, the emergency protective services for each of the four DCFS Area offices were consolidated into the Cook County Child Protective Services uni.t. This unit supervised response to reports by Area CPS offices and provided follow-up services on a county-wide basis. But this partial centralization\" did not solve all of Cook County~s protective service pro~lems. In 1976, I?CF~ asked the . Children's Division of the AIner1can Humane ASsoc1at1on to evalua-ce Cook County's Protective Services Program. Children's Division's Director, Vin<?ent D~ Fra:r;c1~, 1ssued November of 1976. Of .1ts ma.Jor f1nd1ngs, four concerned removal of children from their homes. The study team found that police and hospital personnel took ch~ldren ou~ of their homes without consulting the Department. Commun1ty agenc1es saw the Department lias a 'child snatching' service for use ~s a la~t resort.\" Placement foster care occurred at an alarln1ngly h1g~ rate: 60-75% of the cases served by the Department. And of the\u00b7 child protective cases seen in court, approximately one-~alf.r7sulted in no finding of neglect, implying that removal was not Just1f1~~. '.rhe team also found \"an absence of synchronization. between ,~he various units because of basic differences in philosophy, orientation, training and skills.\" Finally, they found a lack pf clear account\u00ad ability, both to the community for protecting its children and to families already in the DCFS sYGtem. Based on these findings, the study team made several recom\u00ad menda,tions for protective services in Cook County. It recommended that DCFS \" --centralize its protective services; and tra;j.ning of supervisors and administrators; --increase interdisciplinary consultation available to the child protection staff; -56~ ! I f1 o I '1;f\u00b7 ' I ! I f I I system; --fully utilize a community advisory team; and --continually evaluate the impact of CPS operations. Apparently, DCFS listened to these recommendations. The report's acknowledgements section states, Based on the interim report of the study submitted to the Department in June 1976, the Department Director took action to implement the major recommendations. Task forces have been mobilized and those who initially helped in the study are now shouldering the task of implementing the findings. The recommendation to centralize Cook County's protective services was implemented in 1978, when DCFS reorganized its 18 areas into 8 regions. Later, an office was established in the Division of Program Operations to coordinate Child Protective Services (CPS) statewide. Outside of Cook County, however, most regions used their multiservice workers to perform CPS duties. Nevertheless, criticisms of the Department continued. In 1979, the American Humane Association issued a 600-page survey of America's child protective services, including a section on Illinois. The survey describes both the state policy and the actual practice as reported by area offices. Several gaps in state policy appear: there is no state ,~dvisory committee specifically for child protective services, no-policy regarding caseload size, no policy regarding worker to supervisor ratio, no statewide hotline, and no funding for consultative services (legal, medical, psychiatric, and psychological) outside the larger metropolitan areas. By 1979, DCFS said it was providing 24-hour coverage, with specialized CPS staff on duty in Cook County's regional office specialized CPS staff on call in another regional office, and other staff on call in the six other regional offices. DCFS also told the AHA that CPS,workers receive higher salaries, and a special job classification \"'is currently being studied by a Department conunittee.'\" 20% of the workers had graduate degrees in social work; 2% had other graduate degrees. Only 10% of the workers had no bachelor degree. The service regions provided regular inservice training. -57-Finally, DCFS listed changes needed to and --more community cooperation and understanding. Another analysis of Child Protection in Cook County around 1977 comes from the study by H. Frederick Brown that we mentioned earlier in this chapter, Policies and Practices of the Child Protective Services System in Cook County. The study exrunined 882 child abuse and neglect cases handled by DCFS during the last half of 1977. Brown identified the three major steps in processing CAIN reports as assessment of the report, case assignment and investi\u00ad gation, and follow-up actions in validated cases. Assessment of the report occurred during the first 24 hours after the report was made: the intake stage. As we mentioned earlier, Brown found that full data checks on the involved family were completed only half of the time. And 18.7 percent of the cases were closed during intake, even though intake workers con~ tacted the family in-person in only 6.5 percent of the reports. 88.1 percent of the cases not closed at intake were assign~;~ to one of Cook County's nine CPS teams. The ope~ cases were ! investigated by private agencies contracted by DCFS.. Almost half of the cases sent to a CPS team remained there for over six months. Brown found that investigation was initiated within 24 hours in only about 15 percent of the cases. The average time between receipt of report and investigation was 13 days; the median was five days. The more severe the case, the more quickly the inve&ti\u00ad gation was begun. Brown includes interesting information on the caseworkers' >questioning of the abused or neglected children: Despite frequent physical qontact with these children, workers noted the children's responses to the allegations in only 41 percent (176) of the cases in which recording on this point was clear. When asked, the children's conunents railgf.\\d from support of the allegation in 42.5 percent of the cases, to miri'imizing.,it in 32.4 percent, to contradicting it in 25.0 percent of the cases. -58- L The accused,adu~ts who were questioned contradicted or minimized t~e allegat~on ~n over 90% of the cases; only 6 percent agreed w~th the original allegations. The CPS worker is very likely to encounter both perpetrators and victims who deny or minimize the maltreatment. ' Despite the adults' protests, the workers found that \"about 70 percent (298) o~ the reports were valid in part. >Twelve percent ~eeme~ clearly ~nvalid; the rest (18 percent) were p' robably ~nval~d.\" , (~n half of the cases, investigators found the maltreatment to be less severe than originally reported, d' h ' an ~n anot er 42 percent, ~nvestigators found severity to be about as originally reported. In only 6.6 percent of the cases did the investigators find the cases,to be more severe than originally reported. Brown points out that ~n cases of physical abuse, the reported abuse would probably appear less severe as time passed. Brown also noted the difficulties CPS has faced: Despite a rapidly increasing number of child abuse/neglect reports CPS h~s be~n required to operate under budget and personnel freeze~, deter~orat1ng staff morale, and major reorganization of the State Department. An indication of these problems is the reported fifty percent turnover rate of CPS personnel in Cook County during 1977 and 1978. Brown's Cook County research convinced him that CPS workers needed ~o res~ond to reports much more qUickly, rather than letting the pol~ce gu~de the case from the outset. Therefore, he wrote a grant prop~sa~ whic~,was funded by the Department of Health and Human Serv~ce s Nat~onal Center on Child Abuse and Neglect. The federal g:-ant mone\u00a5 made it possible to add caseworker r.esponse teams, w~~ch funct~oned after nopmal business hours, for each of three Ch~cago areas. The grant stated that the teams would --develop on-the-scene response capability after hours, 7 days ,per week; -~provide crisis intervention after hours; --develop hours; and ' . \",,-use explicit criteria for emergency decisions. The proje7t employed 10 full-time worker~, and reported five turn\u00ad overs dur~ng the two-~ear grant period.. During the last 18 months ~f ope:-at~on, the ~roJect reporte~ serv~ces. Among the seven CPS grant '-59- receivers nationwide, the Cook County project reported the largest total expenditures. A report statE;s, \"If only client services \" are considere'd (that is, excluding costs attributed to overhead andconununity ,services), the actual direct cost averaged $411 per family and $481, per child, the largest direct costs per child among the seven CPS projects.\" Despite these expenditures, the project failed, according to E.H. White and Company, with whom the National Center contracted to evaluate Brown's project: 0 The Chicago project had great difficulty in achieving its goals. Their efforts were hampered by lack of upper administrative support, poor supervision, lack of adequate training, absence of procedures and difficult ongoing agency problems in service delivery. The project will not continue beyond the grant period. The project was never able to sufficiently break away from the agency's crisis orientation to thoughtfully conceive, plan, implement and review any of i~l?~~Ceedings. f . th\u00b7\u00b7 \\J . or superv~sors, e proJect was an en1gma. The grant proposal had been written by an academic the6retician with no experience in direct services. The project supervisor Was not able to obtain a copy of the grant proposal to read until well past the midpoint of the grant period. The familiarity with goals at the administrative level dwindled at the superviscry,level and became non-existent at the staff level. Most staff workers feel that there was nothing innovative or improved about the services provided. The immediacy of response was, according to some, already a departmental priority. There simply was not sufficient staff to carry it out~ However, the project's caseworker supervisor became ill, and regular CPS supervisors began to fill in for him. These substitute supervisors gave the project workers regular assignments that put them out of the office when the police called. The police \\I,'ere then told \"no immediate response workers were available. Soon the police stopped calling at ,all. By August, 1979, the whole project had fallen apart, according to the worke:r; we interviewed. He felt that DCFS administration made success impossible and ultimately killed the project. We learned more about the project's 'administrative probl~ms from John Williams, who eventually served as Projedt Director,': -60--~---~ -.. -' ---- . Williams told us he was assigned to the project weeks after i,t began, and was given no direction. At the time, he was also ser,?,i~g.as CPS' Intake Coordinator and Conununity Relations Adm7n7s~rator, the caseworkers' proJect director, Jeanine Smith, was , transf,~rred to Springfield almost immediately after the project began. The deputy director, Bernadette McCarthy, was also unable t~ d7vote the.ti~e needed to make the project work, according to W2ll2ams. Sm2th s replacement as CPS administrator, Marilyn Nelson, spent most of her time trying to handle -the Intake Unit and paid little attention to the immediate respons~',\\ project. ' Eventually, Nelson ~~,eft to work fol:' a private agency in Ohio. In sum, Williams blamed DCFS' central administration in Springfield for the project's failure. DCFS named a project director and deputy director, transferred the director to S1?ringfield! . and then forgo~ about the project. Thus, a program which ~2ght have 2mproved CPS' ab2lity to help children was rendered 2neffectual. DCFS' handling of the project is typical of DCFS mismanagement during the late 70's. While the AHA survey, Brown study, and HEW project were going on, a 1978 reorganization was going into effect. This continued the centralization begun in Cook County in 1975. Gordon Johnson, then serving DCFS both as Deputy Director, responsible for the manage~ent of ~ll eight regional offices, and as Regional Director for C~2cago~ dis,?ussed the 1978.reorganization ina February 28, 1980 2nterv2ew w2th one of our 2nvestigators. The Cook County region absorbed four area offices now referred to '.' as the North, South, East, and West offices. Johnson said the regional office had simply been serving as a buffer between the four areas and central administration in Springfield; the area offices still operated as separate units, without cooperating and coordinating the management of cases. Johnson was trying to unify management of the Chicago region. ,!ohn,son described pr()blems with DCFS' image. He said other agenc2es looked down on DCFS as non-responsive and uncooperative. Social workers appeared in court unprepared. Many workers were burned out. And DCFS was top-heavy in administrators, partly because the 18 area office administrators had to go somewhere when the are~s were consolidated into eight region~. Johnson said attempts to fire personnel or abolish positions met insurmountable ol?posit~on. Not only did the four Chicago 9,rea offices not cooperate, '\" they hid resources from each other. Caseworkers would find, private agencies in which to place children, keep them secret, and then take the secret with them when they \"left the department. At the time of the interview, Johnson was trying to establish a computerized file of placements. After interviewing Johnson, we interviewed Jeanine Smith, who served as the Chicago region's administrator of CPS. Smith told -61---- ~--~.----------------. . us that because DCFS had had four administ~~ticns in two years, there had been constant reorganization, and CPS staff morale was low. She said that when the newspapers reported a case of child abuse, the Department often was blamed. To appear as if they'were doing something, the Department administrators would then punish the CPS worker.* Smith stressed the importance, and difficulty, of hiring workers with master's degrees in social work. She said that former DCFS Director Jerome Miller (1973-74), had relaJted the department,' s educational requirements, and that since then, the. union had defeated any efforts to raise those requirements. When CPS di.d manage to attract a good worker with a M.S.W.; the worker, often ended up being promoted too soon. Smith added that Cook County had lost administrative support in the last couple of years. She said that the Department of Personnel did not seem to recognize the volume of work that had to be done in Cook County. As the staff was reduced, the remaining staff felt overwhelmed, and did not have tiIDe to properly train new employees. Finally, Smith said that staff in other divisions of DCFS did not understand that CPS did more than investigate, that it also provided services to families in~their homes. On July I, 1980, Public Act 81-1077, which had been approved September 27, 1979, went into effect, amending the \"Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act\" that had been in effect since 1975., ,_ *A book from which we hait! quoted elsewhere, Ruth S. and, C. Henry Kempe I s Child Abus~1 seems to address this kind of problem in the following passage: Workers in child protection need to evaluate their performance constantly and routinely. Instead of seeking scapegoCl;ts for particular failures, everyone should ask \"How could we have done better and how will we change because of our experience?\" Since major decisions are jointly made, no one person is ever solely \"responsible\"; all are responsible\" for good decisions and bad. Human conduct is hard to predict, and it makes sense to share life\u00ad and-death decisions across professional lines so that if a ch~ld is reinjured or killed after being prem~turely returned to his parents, it is possible to say whether the wrong recommendation was avoidable or not. Similarly, when courts ignore the recom\u00ad mendations of a child-protection team and disaster follows, they should certainly know the outGome, though at present they are not routinely informed, at least in the United States. We learn from success and failure, and both shOUld be out in the open. Instead of burying our mistakes, on the grounds for instance of \"clien:t confidentiality,\" we should be aware that we are too often concerned with professional confidentiality; far better to say, \"We were \\'lrong becau~se -62-ii 'i !f j I We have already mentioned the statewide hotline and expanded central register required by the Act, but we have not discussed the A.ct! s many references to Child Pro:t:ecti v.a Services. Reports to the State Central Register, the Act states, will be immediately transmitted to the appropriate CPS unit. The CPS units shall be capable of responding to reports 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Act also expands the 1975 law's discussion of how quickly investigation must begin. Th,e 1975 law states, \"The Department shall initiate an invest.igation of each report of child abuse and neglect under this Act, whether oral or written, within 24 hours after the receipt of such report.\" The 1980 law states, in part, If it appears that the immediate safety or well-being of a child is endangered, that the family may flee or the child disappear, or that the facts otheL~ise so warrant, the Child Protective Service Unit shall commence an investigation immediately, regardless of the time of day or night. In all other cases, investigation shall be commenced within 24 hours of receipt of the report. (Ill. Rev. stat. Ch. 23, ,r 20~7.4) The law goes on to list what an investigation shall include: an evaluation of the environment of the child named in the report and any other children in the same environment; a determina\u00ad tion of the risk to such children if t.hey continue to remain in the existing environments, as well as a determination of the nature, extent and cause of any condition enumerated in such report, the name, age, and condition of other children in the environment; and after seeing to the safety of the child or children, forthwith notify the subjects of the report in writing, of the existence of the. t-eport and their rights existing under this Act in regc~u:d to amendment or expungement. (Id.) The law also sets out time limits II The Child Protective Service Unit shall determine, within 60 days, whether the report is \"indicated\" or \"unfounded\" and report it forthwith to the central register; where it is not possible to initiate or complete an investigation within 60 days the report may be deemed \"undetermined\" provided every ,effort has been made to undertake a complete investigation. The Department may extend the period in which such determinations must be made in individual cases for up to 30 days, but such extensions shall only be made once and only upon good cause shown. (Ill. R,ev. Sta't. Ch. 23, 11 2057.12) If the CPS unit finds no credible evidence tb:~t the child has been abused or neglected, it shall close the case. It may, however, \"suggest services for the family's voluntary acceptance .or refusal. II But if the CPS unit finds credible evidence that.the child has been' abused or heglected, then based upon its determination of the protective, treatment, and ameliorative service needs of the child and family, the Child Protective Service Unit shall ~evelop, with the family, an appropriate service. plan for the family's voluntary acceptance or refusal. (Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 23, '1\"2058.2) -63-When proposing this service plan, the CPS unit may explai~ its \"authority to petition the Circuit Court under the 'Juven~~e Court Act' or refer the case to ~he local law enforcement author~ty, State's attorney, or crimir:ial court.11 The 1980 Act also states that each CPS unit shall \"maintain a local child abuse and neglect inde~ of all cases reported under this Act which will enable it to determine the location of case records and to monitor the timely and prope~,investigation and disposition of cases. I: Fin~lly, Jo~ntly C,'i1:.'i ~nd~v.l.dually to conduct a continuing education and training ,.::t~bgram for DCFS staff, mandated reporters, and the general public on identifying, reporting, and understanding child abuse and neglect. b. The Functions of cps: 1980 to 1981 The new reporting law did not change CPS' functions; the CPS. units continued to investigate reports and provide follow-up services. The law did, however, affect CPS by requiring around\u00ad the-clock response capability, increasing the number of reports through the new hotline, and changing the number .. and nature of forms through the expanded c~ntral register. One effect was to increase the number of cPS;'..iorkers, especially in Cook County. Cook County Organization. Prior to the e~ta~lishment of the i Hotline in Springfield on July 1., 1980, the rnaJor.l.ty of abuse and neglect allega.tipns for Cook County carne into the Inf,?rmation and Referral (I & R)' section which toc\u00b7k down the inforrnat.l.on and sent it over to the Intake Section of ~)ok County CPS. After July 1, 1980 some calls alleging abuse or neglect continued to be received, locally, but the majority were received in Sprinyfie1ci at the new Hotline. After the Hotline workers obtained the nece'ssary infor\u00ad mation, they transmitted it to the Intake Seotion of Cook County CPS. An intake worker would then conduct the initial investigation. If the case proved to be \"founded,\" the case moved to a Geographic Team Worker (in another section of CPS) for the follow-up work. The Geographic Team Worker, a DCFS.multi-service worker, or a con: tractual agency then provided serV.l.ces. In a case where the Hotl.l.ne was notified that protective custody had already been taken, the case was not investigated by the Intake section, but was irr~ediately transferred to the Geographic Team worker . The Commission interviewed many Cook County CPS staff members after the Hotline was established in July of 1~80. We also rode along with workers and sat with supervising caseworkers as they performed their duties. At this time Jeanine Smith was heading up the Cook County CPS office, with three geographic Team Coordinators and one Intake Coordinator. Under the geographical team coordina\u00ad tors were six or seven teams headed\" up by Supervising Social Workers. These Supervi~ors had roughly seven caseworkers reporting to them and doing the field work. We learned that significant problems with CPS continued. The -64-H i ff '1 I I il V , 1 i I~ I I I I ~ ~' 1 J Ii 1 i establishment of the hotline strengthened only one link in the chain of child abuse investigation. The CPS intake and geographic teams continued to be overwhelmed by their tasks. We spoke with one Geographic Team Coordinator who conceded that because of low manpower, there were many unassigned cases. She said tha.t cases were put in order or priority, and less 'serious cases were temporarily handled through telephone calls. Bventually, a worker would go out and talk to the people involved. The Coordinator stated that the pressure to respond to every case led to worker burnout. We observed the cr.l.S.l.S atmosphere' of the Cook County CPS office. One supervisor pleaded with one of her workers to go out and handle a case. The worker had already spent the morning in Chicago's Public Housing projects and did not want to go back out; the worker even asked if the supervisor could handle the case. 'The supervisor told our investigator that because. she had mo+,e cases than she could handle, she had to assign priorities to cases. The highest priority cases were hospital cases, severe abuse, critical neglect, and cases where the police have taken the child into protec\"l:i ve custody. The child's age and the presence or absence of non-abusive caretakers in the horne also affected prioritization. The supervisor confided that she had four or five priority cases for which she had not yet been able to send out a worker. The oldest had been received 11 days earlier. Organization outside Cook County. ~he principal difference between CPS in Cook County and the oth~~r seven regions was the specialization of workers. Only Cook County had CPS workers divided into intake and geogra,phic teams . >In fact, in some parts of the state, prior to the impleme.ntation of 'thE! hotline, there was even~)overlap between CPS workers, and multiservicge workers. The Commission interviewed DCFS worke.rs find supervisors thoughout the state, concentrating on those assignea to cps. In April of 1981, \"lIe intes.;-viewed a CPS sup~rvisor from Northern Illinois. She said ~that the office ;'usedto be ex good one\" before the new hotline anq CANTS system went int9 effect JUly 1, 1980. Nm'l, she said, the office operates on a crisis basis because of the caSe overload. She compared the emergency~ oriented office to afire department. 'I'he supervisQr said that two workers hc:mdled the intake work on about 70 cases a week, while four other workers handled the :,) fol1ow-upwor~. on about 200 opE)n cases per month. One other worker did thE: intake and follow-up work for all Spanish .... speaking families. ,-This heavy caseload, she ~a:t~~, made wo~.kers to a;Lways respon:d within 24 ~~he required in-p~rson investigat10u by CPS 'Workers, so -95-that even though Youth Officers and other law enforcement workers had offered to help investigate complaints, she could not accept their help. The supervisor recommended that CPS be allowed to delegate investigative authority to local police departments or social agencies, leaving the caseworkers time to serve families in which abuse or neglect has been established. Cooperation with police and other agencies. In August of 1980, we spoke with two Youth Officers from the Chicago Police Department about their opinions of DCFS. One said he found the Department difficult to work with, and had developed his own methods of circumventing DCFS. In the past, he would see a clear case of child abandonment, call DCFS, and get a long runaround before the children were taken off his hands. At the time of our interview, the officer would directly call a caretaker service with a DCFS contract to come get the abandoned children. He would completely circumvent DCFS, leaving the Department and the contractual agency to complete the paperwork after the children were already placed. The other Youth Officer thought that cooperation between DCFS and the Chicago Police Department had broken down because of the system at DCFS. He felt there were no guidelines to cooperation for the caseworkers. Both officers praised individual caseworkers, finding them quite capable, but stuck in a system that didn't allow them to fully perform. Both officers also felt that DCFS is more concerned with keeping the family together than with protecting children. While the police are required to make arrests in flagrant cases of abuse, DCFS thinks arresting parents is not in the best interest of children. Because of this difference of opinion, DCFS does not share information with the police, and the-police see DCFS as interfering. Thus, the police conduct their Own investigations and take whatever action they feel is hecessary without consulting DCFS. Jeanine Smith told us she liked the idea of \"guest desks.\" Local police departments and juvenile court offices can have <;aest desks for CPS workers to use one or tvlO scheduled days per week. She added, however, that she-would have to stabilize the Cook County CpS office befQr~ starting a guest desk program. Downstate workers found cooperation 'with police to be good. Ed\\'lard W'ojnarowski said CPS I relationship -with the State police is positive, and the State police are becoming more and more inVolved in child abuse and neglect cases, fr~quently accompanying workers on investigations. He said cooperation with local police varies. The three DCFS workers we spoke to in Murphysboro telt that thei; relationships with the police, state' s attorne~r, courts, 9.nd other agencies were very good. One of the workers said this was because they hr.1.d a very good sllpervisQr and becaus~ they worked in a small town environment where everyone wdr~ed hard to solve problems. -66- \" ...,.,.. I , I i I , I) , :, li-~' ------ Ii (1 I Ii I J I i I The caseworker did say, however, that doctors varied in their cooperativeness. She said,that most doctors in the area simply did not report middle class child abuse. More recently, in January and March of 1982, we checked again wi'th two other Chicago Police Department youth officers to see how the hotline was working. They described an immediate police response program, begun in January of 1981, as successful. When DCFS receives a hotline call about an abuse or neglect case in Chicago, the Department simultaneously notifies its Chicago Protective Services office and the Chi'cago Police Youth Division Headquarters. If the police get an emergency (9ll) call, they send a beat officer, who then notifies a youth officer. The youth officer notifies the hotline, and works with the DCFS workers in their investigation. Though the youth officer tries to coordinate his ,or her investigation with DCFS', he or she will not wait for the caseworker to arrive before conducting inte'rviews. In all, there' ~ been little friction between youth officers and DCFS caseworkers since the new immediate response program began. The youth officers listed the advantages of immediate police responses: --police are more mobile than DCFS workers and can thus respond to calls more quickly; --abusers are interviewed before they have time to invent alibis; -,-the evidence 1.s fresher, so a more solid case can be built; --some of the calls concern families with whom DCFS is already involved, and without the police response, might be handled routinely. The youth officers told us their fellow officers had two main complaints about DCFScaseworkers: they take too long to pick children up and take them into 'temporary custody, and they do not exchange information freely. Despite these problems, the sergeant we spoke to said the youth officers' complaints about DCFS have been steadily declining, and it appears that DCFSresponse time is improving~ During the composition of this report, in August of 1982, we called the Administrative Group Commander of the Chicago Police Department's youth Division. The Commander said that the immediate notification program has IIwOrked out very well. II He said that the SCR workers in Springfield are requireq to notify the police regarding certain allegations of abuse. He said that although there used to be delays in notifying the police, the immediate notifica\u00ad tion program had been a success. ' -67----- --------.--..-----~-.~ ------ -------- A July 26, 1982 DCFS memo to all SCR staff explains exactly what kinds of abuse require in~ediate notification of the Cook County police or State's Attorney's Office: 1. Case of death,. brain damage, skull fracture, subdural hematoma, internal injuries, burns, scalding, poisoning, wounds, or bone fracture in which the child has been hospitalized. 2. All physical abuse allegations where the injury is serious (i.e., the child was scarred, extensively injured, extensively marked, or in danger of losing his or her life). 3. Allegations of sexual intercourse, attempted or com\u00ad pleted, sexual exploit:ation, child pornography and/or child prostitution of whidh the parent is aware and/or involved, or sexual mOllestation of any sort. 4. All reports that are second reports on, a family, regardless of the present allegation, the previous allegation, and the severity of the allegations. In May of 1981, Kathryn N. Vedder, a Cook County Hospital pediatrician and a member of the Statewide Citizen's Conunittee on Child Abuse and Neglect, complained to us about th~:; inunediate noti\u00ad fication policy. She opposed SCR groing straight t6 the police instead of notifying them through the local DCP office because the police often arrive at about the same time as the injured child. First, according to Vedder, come t.hle beat officers, then the supervising sergeant, then perhaps a detective, and finally a youth officer, until the emergency l~oom is crowded with police. ~ Vedder also said the Cook County HOSlpi tal Child Protection Coalition was quite upset about the inunediate notification policy and thf: fact that hospital personnel were not consulted about it. When we spoke with the Administl:-ative Group Conunander in August of 1982, he said that the beat: officer no longer handles abuse cases first, unless the call comes into the 911 emergency number. He said that only the youth cfficer goes to handle the case. The exception is a death or very serious injury, in which case a violent crimes investigator would also be dispatched to the hospital. Complaints: caseloads, paperwork, training resources. The CPS workers we spoke to often complained about heavy caseloads, heavy paperwork, inadequate training, and a lack of space and equipment. ,:;:1 , In April of 1981, one of our investigat;ors spoke to the super\u00ad visor of a Cook County CPS unit that oversees contractual in-home services. His in-home services unit monitors Purchase of Service contracts. Whenever it is decided that a child can best be served within its own home ,the case' is given to the in-home services unitt. -68---------------------------------------------------~~----------------------------------~----- , The supervisor aired a by-now familiar complaint: overwork. With eight workers, his unit had 1200 open cases, with 900 to 1200 new cases coming into Intake every month. The supervisor said it was next to impossible to keep up with such a caseload. He said that DCFS never hires enough workers to handle all the cases the law requires them to handle. The problem, he said, was with DCFS' managers. He said a good manager need not be trained in social service, and it might even be to his or her advantage to be some\u00adthing besides a social worker. The supervisor said it doesn't take long for a worker to figure out that when you are given an impossible task, no one really expects you to do it. So the worker does what she can until she realizes her actions are futile and looks for another job. The poorest workers can't find other jobs, so they are the ones who stay. On January 9, 1981, we again met\"with Jeanine Smith, administra\u00ad tor of Cook County Child Protective Services, to Qsk her about problems faced by CPS. She told us that Cook County CPS lacks experienced workers, adequate training, telephones, dictaphones, and most all, office space. She also complained about the low salaries paid her workers. She pointed out that Chicago Police youth Officers are given a year of training and probably $18,000 pet year, while her CPS workers are given almost no training and $12,000 per year. She also said that CPS' clerical workers are underpaid, so they uS.e CPS as a training ground and then go on to a higher salary in private industry. c. Ride-alongs To better understand how CPS functions, our investigators rode along with CPS workers on case investigations. During one ride\u00ad along, we learned that the subject of the investigation had been involved in a chi.ld abuse court case back in 1975, and that the caseworker wanteo.' to look at the file. Because the closed case dated back five years, she asked her team supervisor to help her find it down in the basement storage room. Our investigator went along, and saw files placed in cardboard boxes and stacked in the hallway. The supervisor pointed out that anyone could easily carry files out an opeti exit door at the end of the hallway without being seen. The supervisor then searched through the boxes in the hallway, many of which were completely unmarked. He then went into the lunchroom and searched through the filing' cabinets--some broken, some unlocked, anQ some missing drawers. He couldn't \u00a3ind the file. The supervisor then said that adoption records were stored in the room, which anyone could get into. Finally, he called the \u00a3iling system \"disgusting\" and said, \"I hope you put this in your ~eport.\" Two weeks later, our investigator returned to the CPS office to discuss the filing system with the team supervisor who had searched for the 1975 file. The supervisor told him there was no -69- --~ -- --~~-~-~-~~- ope at CPS with sufficient skills in filing and maintaining records; the clerks received no training in systematic filing. He said CPS needed a separate section for records, but tha't would be a major llndertaking. The s,upervisor stressed the importance of being able' to find closed case files. Much of the information that might prove use\u00ad ful to the caseworker was not stored in the computer. But, he said, the caseworker's chances of finding a particular closed file in the basement were 50/50 at best. A lot of caseworkers no longer bothered to even look for closed files. During the ride to the child's home, the intake worker dis\u00ad cussed the stress of being a CPS worker. ;Sp>.e sai,d the stress was partly caused by inadequate staff, improper reports (which lead the workers to confront upset families who have not really abus.ed their children), and the simple experience of seeing abused children . She also complained that schools wait until the last day of school to report abuse, so they will not have to face hostile parents themselves. Not only is it hard to deal with the large number of allegations that come in all at once, but it is hard to find the children once school is out. The worker also discuss~d working with the police, saying she had never had any problem getting the police to accompany her when she needed them. However, she suggested that three or four officers be assigned to th~ DCFS office, always a,vailable to accompany workers on threatening cases. The accompanying officers would then be experienced with abuse, instead of beat officers who might not know what to do. . The caseworker conunented that it takes almost a year to feel comfortable with being a CPS worker. She recalled three separate incidents in which ~\\abies arrived dead at hospitals, and the worker had to simultaneous]y console and ,interview the mother--not knowincr ,if the mother was responsiblefo;r the death or not. \" t\" d. 1981 Re?rganization The CPS structu:e.lasted ,less thanl,a year before more changep were made. DCFS adm~nl..s.trat0rs' focus had moved from the hotll.ne c;tnd central register to the next critical step in child protection-\u00ad ~nvestigation. The, major change was the creation of the Division of Child Protection and the use of investigative teams'consisting of nurses, social workers, and experienced investigators. The new use of investigators in CPS was publicly discussed at a May 27, 1981 meeting of the Statewide Advisory Coinmittee ,on Child Abuse and Neglect. Gordon Johnson, Depu.ty Director, stated tliat one of DCFS' most glaring weaknesses was the initial investigation of an abuse allegation. He sa.id that in recent, cases which eventually ended in the child~B death, a trained investigator would have se~m dail.ger signs that the social workers missed.' Thus , DCFS was try~ng out, a model CPS program in Cook County that employed aI:l -70-~, I. j l I Il-member investigative team. (Michael Tristano later conunented, \"If it works in COQ~ County it will work anywhere,lI a conunent that downs tate CPS. administrators might not agree \\'li th. ) The eleven members would be a registered nurse, a trained investigator, and nine MSW social workers, all trained to conduct imTestigations. If the team finds that abuse is indicated in a reported ease, the case is refer;red tOH a follow-up team. The teams were expected to cut the, investigative reporting time from 60 days down to 10 days. . The investigative teams would report directly to Michael Tr~stano, head of-the newly created Division of Child Protection since May 18, 1981.. . In August of 1982, \\'1e spoke with James Winters, Administrator of the Cook County Division of Child Protection. He said that Cook County is served by ten DCP teams, eight day teams and two night teams. 64 investigative social workers and eight investigators make up the day teams. Four nurses act as consultants to Cook County DCP, handling DOA's, meeting with coroners, and acting as hospi tal liaisons. The nurses. are not assigned to specific teams. When we asked Winters why DCFS began the new system of child abuse investigation, he answered that the old Intake and Referral system was inefficient. The workers had been making the minimum number of phone calls to verify allegations, and had little face\u00ad to-face contact with the complainants or family members. Thus 1 cases were-being referred to the geographical teams without a com\u00ad plete investigation by Intake and Refert.\"al. Also, the CANTS forms were not always filled out correctly and promptly. Winters ('3 aid that the Intake workers were constantly playing catch~up. . A~,Jsoon c;s they started to catch up on their current cases f tb,e~r supe,:Lv~sors would .', give them even more. The IlDtake workers were overWhelmed and: una9le to complete thorough investi\u00ad gations. Winters s.aid Intake ~7as investigating onl.y 50% of the cases co~ing in, and were closing only 30% of the cases. The rest went to. the geqg,raphical teams. Intake IS ineff:i,ciency hurt DCFS '. relationship with. families .. A caseworker can!lot convince, a family of the importance of. being responsible and being o.n time for appointments when the worker himself cannot \"meet deadlines. Very often, according to Winters, an Intake worker would make an appoihtment with a family: aet over\u00ad whelmed with additional priority ca~es, and not be able to\"'cancel the appointment beda'Use the family had no tel~phone. The family would bel,e;et'waiting a . casewo!.~ker -who n~V',er showed workers WOUld. provido se~vices to the tam~ly at the same time they were conducting the investigation. Sometimes services do have to be offered immediately, but when the child j,s not, in, serious (ianger, the qase\\\\Torker should complete a thorough investigatiq;n, including an assessment of. th~ family's needs, before told us that \"thousands\" of cases were mismanaged because of the old system's poor tracking. Intake and Referral sent cases to many different DCFS units, and no one knew where cases were going. Winters contrasted Intake investigating 50% of the cases with DCP investigating 100%'of the cases. Furthermore, unfounded cases under DCP have risen from 30% to 50%, and they are trying to push the percentage to 60%. Winters feels that DCP supervision is much better, and that the workers are making much more efficient use of -cheir time. He added that when DCP was established, guidelines were tightened and goals were clarified. When the workers are operating under strict guidelines and procedures, they feel more comforta.ble because they know exactly what is expected of them. They also feel more confident that they will not automatically be blamed if something goes wrong. Winters said one of the first things DCFS did when DCP was established was to cut down the caseload of every DCP worker. He added that under the old system, an inefficient worker could hide behind the excuse of an overwhelming caseload. He said that a case\u00ad worker should maintain a caseload of seyen. Although Winters feels that seven is an acceptable figure, DCP is pushing its workers toward 12, having found-that many workers can easily exceed 12 cases; many handle 15 to 25. The main incentive for the workers is competitiveness between the different teams. Winters said that when DCP began, they had to deal with a backlog of cases and orders from Springfield to meet the 24-hour response mandate on, new cases. In order to meet the deadline, Winters had to pull one member from e~ch team to simply determine which cases needed immediate attention because children were at risk. These caseworkers did no investigating. . Winters then said they still have 60 d.ays to complete an ' investigation, which can be extended to 90 days, but that DCP pol,icy states that investigations should be completed within 10 days. Winters believed DCP met the 10-day deadline on the most serious cases. The requirement to see everyone in the household is unnecessary, according to Winters. The requirement is not legal, Qut is part of DCFS policy. Winters felt that if the worker determines that an allegation is unfounded, the child is all right, and the home is a safe one, then there is no reason for the worker to see every member of the household. Winters went on to r::ay that when DCFS has no credible evidence on a case, ,it should get out; he felt that in many ca.ses, workers end up badgering the family for no reason. He estimated that DCP could save 30% of its time if workers were not always required to see everyone in the household. Winters said felt that DCP and coordinate files. that when DCP was first formed, administrators follow-up workers should meet face-to-face to Winters had earlie,r given us a DCFS document -72-R , I ! I I 1 I .'.' .. \\ ..... J ;l entitled, \"Child Abuse and Neglect Investigations: An Overview,\" which states, If the finding is \"Indicated,\" the investigative worker will con\u00ad tact the follow-up team supervisor responsible for that geographic area in order to schedule a case staffing. The staffing or meeting will have as participants the investigative worker and the follow-up worker assigned to the case. Jointly, they will review the investigative findings and the dynamics of the case. . . The investigative worker will also accompany the follow-up worker during their first contact with the family in order to introduce the worker and discuss future plans. Winters said, however, that DCP and follow-up workers communicate only in the most unusual circumstances. He said that meetings between them would cause a backlog of 400 cases per month. He would also have to contend with the schedules of both DCP and the follow-up units. If the DCP worker has a very unusual or compli\u00ad cated case, the worker will put a note on the case report asking the follow-up worker to contact him or her. Winters felt that DCP's thorough investigations and case reports make meeting with follow-up workers unnecessary. Finally, he said that other DCFS units still distrust and are even hostile toward DCP. In September of 1982, a Commission invest.igator spoke with one of the 10 team supervisors working in Cook County's DCP. According to the supervisor, the main difference between the old system and the new system is that now those doing the investi\u00ad gations in DCP are taking the investigations from start to fin,ish, whereas before, cases might be partially investigated by CPS Irl~a$e and. completed by the Geographic Team. An advantage to this new\" system is that a caseworker going to court on a temporary custody hearing is not the same caseworker that is going to be treating the family later. There has always been a feeling that it is not feasible for one worker to perfor~n both duties. The supervisor stated that the new system has brought tremendous improvement, commenting that the old\u00b7 system was a \"patchwork mess.\" The supervisor stated that under the old system some workers had to see as many as four to five cases per day~: Under this system, they lost a lot of good people. He stated also that people left before the new system was implemented without ever giving it a chance. Currently, caseworkers are seeing approximately four to five c~ses per week and at least 12 to 15 cases per ~onth, besides the t~me that they spend in court. Cases are cUrrently, being assigned to workers as priority one, two, or three. Priority one denotes the worst type of cases or DQAs. Priority two includes cases of fractures, bruises, lacerations, etc. And priority three is the lowest priority: cases where there are allegations of inadequate clothing, mild neglect, dirty houses, etc. Commission interviews at Cook County DCPwe had an opportunity to view several case files. Most of the files we viewed were organized and neatly arranged. We believe these files could be easily reviewed by the follow-up caseworkers who are de~tined to receive the files of the founded cases. However, we st~ll found many files that were disorganized and incomplete. Nevertheless, the condition of the files has improved over their condition in prior years. Though the DCP has received a generally favorable response in t~e Department, there are some criticisms. One complaint was that w7th the new system caseworkers and supervisors have very little t~m~ to confer, as caseworkers are always busy working on investi\u00ad gat~ons. One Department source complained to us that too many cases that should not be indicated, are being indicated. For example, a case where a six-year-old was playing in his front yard and ran out into the street, while playing, and was hit by a car. The case was lIindicated\" for lack of supervision. The source believed that the over-indicating came partly as a result of an incident in which a DCP Investigator resigned after failing to do an adequate investigation. , Assistant S~ate's Attorney Diane Romza told us that the DCP J.nvest~ga'tors still need more training in asking the right questio.ns and teistifying in court. Romza said, for example, that when the DCP investigators interview doctors, they often fail to obtain a specific diagnosis explaining exactly how the victims were hurt. Or the investigators will say that an abuse incident has been \"verified. by va.:z;-ious relatives\" without giving the witness.es' names and addresses. Romza stressed the need for training DCP investi- \" gators how to testify in court, saying that many investigators are presently very defensive in court, and that many times she has seen DCP workers fall apart on the stand. A CPS Follow-up Supervisor told. us that many case's from DCP.t have to be re-investigated by CPS Follow-up Team workers. She . said thW reC.eive disorganized files and confusing reports .. Often she sail\", she cannot figure out from a report who did' what when .. ' Sometimes the interviewee's relationship to the victim is not given. The supervisor said about half of the DCP cases that come across her desk are very tough to figure out. Sheagded that having two different units serving the families disrupts continuity. She said DCP very often makes promises to the cli~nts that the CPS Follow-up teams cannot keep. The supervisor cla~med that DCP workers have even promised families that their cases would be unfounded, and then ended up sending the case to CPS. In these cases, CPS becomes th~ \"heavy.\" . ,DCP has the chief responsibility for the first contact with vJ.ctJ.ms and the assessment of risk to the child. From here, the case moves to the Divis~on of Program Operations for follow-up work. Though the follow-up work fall.s under a different division, we will discuss it here for the sake of continuity. -74-( '., J I fi 11 I', r\\ tt 11 L1 [I t 1:; 1 ij t\u00b7 r f I] '. fl ~ ~.! , / . ..:J. , f I ! i l The case is transferred from DCP to follow-up by way of the Service Coordination Unit (SCU). When an SCU worker gets cases from DCP, he breaks them down according to geographic area, and then looks to see if everyone in the family was seen. He also checks to see if there is a need for more recommendations on the case. The SCU worker also deter\u00ad mines whether or not the DCP investigator looked at the allegations as compared to the story given. And, of primary importance, he determines if the child is still at risk. Before assigning a case to the appropriate follow-up team, the Service Coordination worker considers two factors: the amount of services needed and the urgency. He then assigns a letter (A, B, or C) to the case according to its urgency: (A) means contact within 24 hours; (B) means contact within three days; and (C) means contact within five days. This assignment of letters is only a recommendation made by the Service Coordination Unit worker. According to the CPS supervisor, they send back only about five percent of the cases that they receive from DCP. She also said that 85% of the cases that they get go on to Ch~ld Welfare Services. There are currently 15 follow-up teams located at the area offices, at a Harvey, Illinois outpost, and at 1026 South Darnen, Chicago. One of the follow-up teams at 1026 South D~~en investi\u00ad gates all of the sexual abuse cases. Sexual abuse cases are routed directly to that follow-up team for investigation rather than being investigated by the DCP teams. Cases sent from SCU to the follow\u00ad up teams are sent by courier. In September, 1982, we spoke to both a follow-up supervisor and follow-up caseworker. The supervisor stated that as a follow\u00ad up team supervisor, her role is to get indicated abuse and neglect cases from DCP via the Service. Coordination Unit (SCU) and assign them to one of her workers for follow-up. Follow-up might include going to court as well as providing services to the family directly or through contractual agencies. She stated that cases usually come to the follow-up teams 10 days after the report is made, but c~n come up to five months later. In cases where a child is already in protective custody, they receive them in about seven days. The supervisor sta,ted that they then keep cases for long as necessary to provide services. Though cases are only supposed to remain there for up to 18' months, they can act,ually remain longer. On'an average, however, they keep cases where,the children are at -75-n (' r r t I ~------- -------------~--~-----\\~------~.------~--------.----------------------------------~----------------~--------~----------~~--------------------------.----------------~~ )) 'i ',., : f 10 o f,.,~-\u00b7-~-\u00b7\u00b7---~~\u00b7-~-\u00b7~.;;.,:::-;::;'...,-.;;\u00b7 .;,.~.'::.:.-;:::. =\u00b7::'=.==::;:-\u00b7-;;:'r=\u00b7:::::;=:::::::;:::::::::.:==:::::;::;\u00b7\u00b7:::'-'=,\"=.~'''':'~'''''M\"~\"\"\":::':j!~ f r t .. 1 I I I I C' j/ .. t\"\" i ~ i I ~ \\, I I home between nine months and a year. She added that if they anti\u00ad cipate that a case will be long-term, they transfer it to Child Welfare Services. Masters stated that the bulk of the cases in CPS follow-up are cases where the child is in the home and \"at risk.\" According to the efficiency of the worker and the types ::of cases, each caseworker may have between 18-45 cases per month. Her whole team serves about 300 families per month. About 40 of these are serviced by contractual agencies. The supervisor believed that the quality of investigations has improved under DCP. One problem that has developed is the differences of opinion between DCP decisions and CPS follow-up teams decisions. She said that the new system \"sets up an automatic dichotomy with DCP and follow-up.\" She said that she really preferred the other system because she saw the case almost all of the way through; now, she gets cases where maybe promises were made by a DCP worker that a follow-up worker can't keep. She added lilt's difficult to pick up the pieces\" after DCP. Clients are sometimes not in the best frame of mind by the time the investigation has been done and follow-up has to contend with them. It appears that the next area for DCFS administration attention will be the follow-up teams. The Department has successfully brought about significant improvement at the hotline and registry function of the Department and indications are that DCP is accom\u00ad plishing its child protection mandate better than CPS did in the past. This, then, is how protective services are currently organized. Protective Services reports to the state, independent of regional operations. Investigative teams investigate all reports of child abuse and neglect within 24 hours. By law, the teams have 60 days to complete the investigation, and this can be extended to a total of 90 days. DCP's policy, however, is to complete investigations within 10 days. After the investigation is complete, founded cases are turned over to CPS follow-up workers (who are regionalized under Program Operations) in Cook County. Unfounded cases in which the parent is willing to accept recommended services are turned over to multiservice workers in Cook County. Outside of Cook County, both founded and unfounded cases qre turned over to the general multiservice workers for follow-up. DCP has 30 teams through the State now, with approximately ten members on each team. Cook County has 10 teams composed of a total of 64 investigative social workers, eight investigators, a~d four nurses. 3. Licensing . , Licensing' functions were turned over to DCP in August of 1982; -76-\" 1 I I I i they were formerly handled at the Regional level. As DCP is organized at the state rather than regional level, licensing duties are now carried out at the state level, with regional licensing coordinators accountable to the state central office. The reorgani\u00ad zation did not involve any change in the licensing requirements or functions. The Department licenses Child tl1elfare agencies, Child Care institutions, Maternity Centers (for unwed pregnant girls under 18), Group homes, foster family homes, day care centers, day care homes, and night-time facilities. Such facilities must be licensed to do business with DCFS. Licenses are for two years. Child Welfare agencies that place children in foster homes can in turn license such homes for DCFS. Agencies or persons providing services but not care, such as Homemakers, advocates, or counsellors, are not licensed. Before issuing a license, DCFS examines the prospective licensee for compliance with Department standards, such as amount of space, utilities, staff ratios and training, etc. Furthermore, a criminal background check is done on anyone applyin9 for a license except for those wishing to open a day care home. One weakness we found in these criminal background checks is that DCFS does not check the background of, for instance, an uncle or son living with an applicant for a foster care home 'license. Thus, it would be possible that a child would be placed in a home where a relative of the foster parents had a historY of violent or sexually criminal behavior. Before granting a license, DCFS does not simply determine compliance with standards: workers help the applicant to meet the standards. This was said to be true also after the license had been granted. DCFS licensing workers make four basic types of visits: initial licensing, supervisory (to check compliance with standards); renewal .. and consultation (when needed to work out difficulties in compliance with standards). At each step, licensing workers help the licensee to comply with standards, taking a \"positive\" approach. We learned that this was simply a way of saying that enforcement powers were weak. To illustrate this, in a May, 1980 interview, Wi'llye A. Coleman, Day Care Licens ing unit supervisor for Cook COlli\"'lty, described the process of seeking com\u00ad pliance at an institution. If the center is in continual violation and \"pleading\" by licensing staff fails, then representatives of the center are called in to the DCFS office for an administrative conference. The center and DCFS licensing staff members try to work out whatever problems are occurring; usually more compliance time is granted. If this fails, the matter is turned over to the ;, chief' of Licensing Services in Springfield, who will either visit the \u00b7facili ty to encourage compliance or will write to the center. The Licensing units have no disciplinary powers. If the center still will not comply, DCFS may hire a hearing officer and conduct a hearing. This happens i'nfre.qq$11tly Staff shortages were cited as the biggest cause of these -77- problems. Though licensing units are required to make monitoring visits yearly, these visits occur in reality only about every two years. One Foster Care Licensing Supervisor told us that workers were able to spend about 45 minutes per year with each foster family. Thus, the license renewal inspection is effectively the only inspection made. Because of staff shortages, DCFS would make supervisory visits {to check compliance with standards} only after receiving a complaint about a facility. Finally, meeting the requirements for a license does not ensure good care, for example with a foster family. DCFS workers told us that when they feel a licensed family or facility is substandard, the Department would simply not make referrals rather than seeking license revocation. This is because of the lack of enforcement powers in the licensing units. Though licensing is now under DCP, the investigations of technical violations and investigations of allegations of abuse or neglect of children in licensed facIlities will remain discrete. If DCP investigates allegations of abuse or neglect, licensing representatives may g.t the same time conduct a compliance examination. This should give the licensing unit more authority in monitoring compliance. D Division of ManagE.\\ment and l~.E9get At present, the Division of Management and Budget is a cen\u00ad tralized agency, with no field staff. This division has several sectio~s: Management Services, Information Services, Financial Policy .,and Systems p,esign, Affirmative Action, and Contracts and Grants. Only Contracts and Grants is of interest to us in this report. All of these sections develop policies and guidelines that must be followed by the s~::.ctions I counterparts in the regions and in other divisions of DCFS, for instance, affirmative action. Most direct care serv'ices provided to clients of DCFS --such as residential care, foster care, counselling, legal and medical services, and psychological care --are purchased by the Department from private agencies and persons. This necessitates a comprehensive system of developing and entering intq contracts. As the child welfare system is continually changingr, new, experimental programs must be tried out, so DCFS awards gran.ts for the development of new approaches to the problems faced in child welfare. There are several ways to distinguish betweJ,m cOlntracts and grants. Contracts are for services to be provided on an (mgoing basis. Contracts can be renewed year a.fter year. Grants are for more experimental programs and are not generally renewed beyond the initial grant period. Should DCFS find that a service developed under a grant meets some of the Department's needs, it can negotiate a contract with the agency. Grant money is usually paid quarterly, in advance. Money for a contract is paid monthly; a contract is for one year. With a contract, DCFS reimburses the agency for units of service after they have been provided, with a maximum payment. Therefore, -78-n \\;1 i1 , I' I tj [j I i 1 l f I tl 1 r lj I f ,I r' ~ [ ~:I \\< 1:; \\Q.:1 i .~! ; i ~ t ~ [l ,/ ' '~i ::1 n .J ,j 1 \"j J 1 \" '.~ , '1 I. the agency must have some initial operating capital. Both contracts and grants can be terminated for appropriate causes. Agencies or institutions providing residential care, such as Child Care Institutions (e.g., for the physically and mentally handicapped), Group Homes, Community Living Facilities (for adults), etc., and other large facilities, such as Day Care Centers, must hold a license with DCFS before applying for a contract. Should an unlicensed agency approach DCFS to be considered for a contract, DCFS will refer the agency to the Licensing Division (discussed under DCP), which will then provide the applicant with appropriate regulations. Once the applicant is licensed, a contract can be negotiated. Until July, 1978, all contracts for services were signed at the state level. Area offices would locate resources, work out the terms of a contract, and send the contract to Springfield for signature. After the move to regionalization in 1978, Regional Administrators had the authori ty to sign contracts ~ Each region would locate agencies that could provide needed services and nego\u00adtiate contracts without involvement of a central office. Ideally, the regional system would have involved assessment of needs --the regional office should know best what services it required. It was hoped that Regional Administrators would send out Requests for Proposals to local agencies, which would in turn propose to provide services to meet the regional needs. The regional office would then award a contract to the bidder 'whose program best met the needs at the lowest cost. However,in practice RFPs were rarely used. Generally, agencies with long-standing relationships with DCFS would retain contracts or be awarded contracts for new services. Agencies would often approach DCFS with proposals for new programs; if the regional office felt that the proposed program met c.ertain Department needs, a contract would be drawn up. The Regional Administrator, if he thought a new program should be developed, would often approach an agency already under contract for other services and ask it. to develop a program, instead of sending out RFPs. This system has faults. Needs were not accura:tely assessed, so that. p).lrchased care would not necessarily fulfill the changing requirements of DCFS. Providers did not have much reason to improve services since contracts were generally awarded year after year unless gross non-compliance was detected. In our interviews with Contracts and Grants personnel, understaffing was often claimed as a reason for these problems. In 1981, the signature authority for contracts was returned to the cehtral office. Regional adm,tnistrators can still sign routine, standardized service contracts, for example with day care centers. According to pol~cy implem~pted in the Fall of 1981, contracts for new services\" will be sent out for bids. Needs are to be assessed at the regional level; RFPs will be deyeloped by the regional offices\" which will send them to the Division of Management and Budget for app~oval. The RFPs will be sent out for 'bid -79-. ~- -----------,---------...--------....---~---~--~----------~~---------~--------~---~~- -- by the central office, which will award the contract. The RFPs for demon~tration grants (for developing new programs) will be handled by the Division of Policy and Plans, Office of Program Development. These also must be approved by the Division .of Management and Budget. Furthermore, all contracts for non-resi\u00ad dential care must be sent out for rebid every four years, so that renewal of these contracts will no longer be, in effect, automatic. It is still too early to tell whether these changes in the adminis\u00ad tration of contracts and grants will improve the quality of services purchased. Other than those prepared by the Office of Program Development, few RFPs have been sent out because DCFS is not developing many service initiat.ives during this tight budget period. Evaluation Until late 1977, DCFS had a monitoring and evaluation unit in Contracts and Grants that determined compliance ,on the part of agencies. After its abolition, there was never any clear procedure for monitoring: some interviewees said that the Contract Administrator was responsible for monitoring the facilities, others that the caseworker was to do so to determine if the individual child was receiving adequate services. Many reported that facilities were monitored by once-a-year inspections or even less. To make matters worse it was not until this year that a procedure for evaluating the effectiveness of types of services was established. Back in the spring of 1982 an evaluation was done to determine the effectiveness of specialized foster care. DCFS Contracts and Grants Manager for the Cook County Region, Charles E. Johnson, told our investigators in April of 1980 that the Department made investigations only of residential facilities applying for contracts, not of agencies applying. Furthermore, he stated that DCFS did virtually no monitoring of existing contracts. Peter Lewis, Progrant Planner for Contracts and Grants of the Cook County Region, told us in July 1980 that such monitoring would not only establish compliance with contracts but would aid caseworkers in keeping track of available services and spaces. He told us that often a child would have to spend the night on the couch in a CPS office because the caseworker could not find a placement owing to inability to keep records of all available resources. Casewor;kers spend hours seeking placement by a hit-and-miss method. And in September of that year, Manager of Service Operations for Cook County Region Sarah Trice told us that the system of monitoring a contract. consisted of taking the ag\"ency' s word for it that the terms of the contract were honored. Presently program monitoring is being carried out at the regional level by contract staff. E. Division of Policy and Plans A June 15, 1982 handbook for the Division of Policy and Plans explains that while three of DCFS' divisions provide services to children and their families (Child Protection, Program Operations, and Youth and Comrnunity Services), two div~sions provide support to managers and fieid staff (Management and Budget and Policy and Plans). -80-t i\u00b7 \\.\\ d 'I , \" r The Division of Policy and Plans supports DCFS staff by --preparing and distributing rules and procedures; --coordinating and evaluating program --acquiring and managing research funding; --training staff; and --reviewing case plans for progress toward permanency. goals. These five functions are performed by five offices within the division: Rules and Procedures; Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation; Program Development and Support; Staff Development and Training; and Administrative Case Review. We shall focus on the Offices of Program Development and Support and Administrative Case Review--the two offices within this division that most directly relate to our investigation of child abuse and neglect. 1. Program Development and Support In September of 1982, we spoke with Linda Avery, Associate Chief of Program Development and Support. Avery told us that the office performs three major functions: writing grant proposals to obtain outside funding, administering the State Child Abuse Grant Program, and developing program models. Avery then explained the processes for gaining and administering grants. For federal grants, Avery begins by reviewing the federal register for funding announcements. Avery looks for grants which might fit DCFS' priority needs as identified by the executive staff and the deputy direetors of DCFS' divisions. Avery then describes any such grants to Director Coler in a memo which also recommends different ways of using the grant. Coler decides which, if any, recommendation will be pursued. The Office of Program and Develop\u00ad ment's grant writer then writes a proposal. The proposal is reviewed, in turn, by Avery, the Director of the Office of Program Development and Support, the Director of the Division of Policy and ~lans, the Director of DCFs,~/~he director of the division which will use the grant, and th~' ,reau of the Budget. Once all these administrators have approve..,;_Jhe proposal, it is submitted to the federal funding source. In fiscal 1982, DCFS received approximately $2,000,000 from external funding sources. Of this, approximately one-and-a-half million came from the Illinois Law Enforcement Commission. DCFS used the ILEC money to pick up functions previously performed by . the Commission on Delinquency Prevention eliminated by Governor Thompson. Avery said that DCF~ usually obtains four to six external grants a year. Regarding the State Child Abuse Grant program, Avery said that the program's funds are appropriated by the legislature under -81---.. the line item \"Grant-in-Aid for Research and Treatment of Child Abuse and Neglect.\" The program was appropriated $1,225,400 in bqth FY 1982 and FY 1983. The program's final report for FY 1981 states, the Grant Program funded 63 projects with a total expenditure of $1,384,946. These projects can be broadly categorized by services offered as follows: Therapy and Counseling Projects Self-Help Groups Crisis and High Risk Intervention Projects Multi-Disciplinary Teams Outreach and Advocacy Projects Service Coordination and Networking Projects Community Awareness Projects Parenting Training Avery explained that the process for awarding grants is similar to the process for awarding Purchase of Service contracts. In brief, Requests for Proposals are sent to agencies which DCFS feels could operate the new program. After regional personnel review the proposals, an agreement is negotiated, the grant is processed, and the program's expenditures are monitored. If the grant is for s\"tatewide services, the Office of Program Development and Support administers the grant; otherwise, the regional office of Contracts and Grants administers the grant. Avery also explained the differences between grants and Purchase of Service contracts. Contracts have to be competitively bid; grants do not. Contractees bill DCFS on a per diem, per /iclient basis; grant recipients are paid one lump sum, and ca~~e paid at the outset. Contracts are usually entered for ongoing, maintenance, services; grants are awarded for research and demonstration projects to develop model programs. \" Finally, Avery told us t.~at if grants under $10, 000 are avail\u00ad able, DCFS does not have to send out a request for proposal. Director Coler has the authority to approve and issue these small grants. Coler is able to award such grants for special needs and crises. 2. Administrative Case Review The division handbook states the Office of Administrative Case Review's purpose: to: promote and assist the movement of children into permanent placement through on-going, l?eriod~c reviews of children in substi\u00ad tute care; identity and assess internal and external barl:'iersto permanency planning; and advise all Department staff on the status of permanency planning for DCFS children as seen through the Administrative Case Review system. i' -82-I I I , DCFS began reviewing sUbstitute care cases formally in July, 1981 to remain eligible for federal funds encouraging permanency planning. The office's staff of 49, including 25 regional case review administrators, is currently reviewing 1,300 cases per month. On September 1, 1982, we interviewed John O'Donnell, Chief of the Office of Administrative Case Review. O'Donnell said that before administrative case reviews began, case reviews only occurreq informally, and it was difficult to get the involved parties together. Private agencies complained that DCFS had no consistent procedure for reviewing the cases of their clients. Caseworker turnover further contributed to the lack of consistency. With the new system, administrative case reviews are done every six months for DCFS wards who have been placed out of their homes for s'ix months or longer. DCFS' computer provides a list of children up for review six weeks in advance, in order to give the reviewers ,time to set up a conference. DCFS then notifies the parents, sending a copy of the notification to the child's case\u00ad worker and any other involved parties, such as the private agency housing the child. At the case review conference, the reviewer questions everyone concerning the goals described in the caseworker's plan. Those present discuss the progress that has been made toward those goals, and whether they continue to be appropriate. New goals may be discussed. O'Donnell told us that the case review administrators may heavily influence case planning, although they have no direct supervisory control over the caseworker. The caseworker certainly may object to the reviewer's suggestions. But the case-review administrator may, in turn, go to the caseworker's supervisor and on up the administrative ladder, if necessary. The children and parents themselves may also obj ect ,\", to the case plan. If they are present, the parents and children are asked to sign the review, indicating their agreement with it goals. If they disagree, they tell the caseworker, and the appeal goes to the supervisor. If necessary, the appeal then goes to the administra\u00adti ve level, then the regional level\", and finally the director of DCFS. Parents also may go back to court to complain. Although he called the administrative case review process \"absolutely vital,\" O'Donnell didn't think that it could be applied tQ all open DCFS cases. He felt that his office would need at least twice as many reviewers, and that it would take a great deal of time, because each case xev,iew takes at least l~ to 2 hours. '. ' We also interviewed a Cook County case review administrator g Susan Demaree, and sat in on t.wo case reviews. Demaree said the purpose of a case review is to determine why DCFS was initially involved and why DCFS is still involved. The caseworker, the parents, the chil'd \"if over thirteen years old, private agency representatives, and other service providers are all invited to -83-attend. The caseworker's supervisor is also -allowed to attend, but typically doesn't. In both r~views that we observed, Demaree clearly explained the ramifications of DCFS involvement in the case. She was very supportive in discussing difficult, sensitive'topics. When we asked the caseworker how she liked the administrative case review process I she answered tha't she favored it because it provided an objective, formal review in which parents and children are brought together to discuss problems and further action. She also said that it is often difficult to solve a family's problem alone, ,and that a third opinion can be very helpful. Although the current case review system simply looks at the problems of individual cases, Iris Slack, the Deputy Director of the Division of. Policy and Plans, told us that the case reviewers had noted some patterns of problems that suggested needs for systematic change. The Division is considering formaiizing this process, using administrative case reviews to systematically improve DCFS' contractual substitute care. F. Divisio~ of Program Operations The vast majority of DCFS' service delivery responsibilities are carried out by the Division of Program Operations. Prior to July, 1978 services to children and families were delivered through 18 Area Offices. These off.ices were then consolidated into 8 Regions, each of which is supervised by a Regional Administrator. The Deputy Director of Program Operations, Gordon Johnson, oversees the activities of each Region. Johnson has also served as Acting Regional Administrator of Region 2B, Cook County, for the past two years. In addition to each region, Offices of Program Service, Suppor't Services and Adoption Services are currently separate units within Program Operations. For our purposes here we will highlight only activities of Adoption Services and the general functions of the Regions. 1. Adoption Services Although each region performs adoption services functions under the direction of the Regional Administrators, adoptioi'l activities are also carefully supervised at~he state level by the Adoption Services office within Program Operations. Until last year, the office of Support Services performed this function, but the recent emphasis on permanency planning as well as the adoption initiative led to the c~eation of a separate unit. Anthony Veronico, Associate Director and Guardianship Administrator, is responsible for this new unit. According to the Department's 1982 Human Services Plan, the \"goal of the adoption program is to increase the use of adoption as a means of providing permanent care when it is impossible for -84-t t , I families to provide a permanent, secure, and nurturing living situation for their own children \" The Plan sunwarizes the magnitude of the problem: The number of children in substitute care on December 31, 1980, was II, 188, of whom 6,073 have been in substitute care over two years. Just over 50 percent of those in substitute care are 12 and under. National studies have indicated that adoption may be an appropriate goal for as many as one-third of the children who are in substitute care. In May of 1982, conunission staff interviewed Anthony Veronico about DCFS' efforts in adoption. Veronico told us that in the early 1970s, Illinois was a leader in adoptions in the country, wi.th around 1,000 adoptions per year. In the, early years of the decade, this situation deteriorated, perhaps because other areas be\u00a2arne higher priorities, so that adoptions suffere4 as a result. In 1979, Director Coler came to DCFS and stated that two of his highest goals for the Department were abuse and permanency planning for children in need. In the spring of 1980, DCFS began an assess\u00ad ment of its adoption programs, in Ea.st St. Louis, Chicago, and Marion. Other Jregions had caseworkers who handled adoptions along with other duties. ' Some regions may have been purchasing services from private aqencies instead. There were about 40 adoption workers statewide. Their priorities included the need for more staff who had specialized training to do work with \"special needs\" children. However, more staff was not enough: better management and training were also needed. DCFS\u00b7 adoption initiative was thoroughly described in a letter to the Commission dated April 23, 1982, from Dwight Lambert, Chief of the Office of Permanency Services. The bulk of the letter follows: Early in 1980, Directpr Coler identified adoption as one of the major priority components of the Department's pe~~nency planning ,initiatives for FY 81 and FY 82. Goals directed toward the Department's adoption revitalization efforts were established resulting in the following major accomplishments in the adoption initiative. o In June, 1980 a survay)of the Dep~~tment's regional adoption programs, focusing on barriers to adoption and initiatives to reduce/eliminate the barriers was completed. The survey identified two majdr barriers to a successful ado~tion program: 1. Fully operational adoption units were found in only three regions (the remaining five regions were pro\u00ad viding adoption services but did not have specialized adoption units); -85----~~--~----------------------------------------~--------~---~----------------------------~~---. N4 iQAg f \" o o o o o 2. Legal expertise to assist with court issues relating to adoption was lacking in all regions. In November, 1980 a program ent:i:tled\u00b7\"One Church -One Child\" was initiated. in Chicago by Father George Clements a:ld the Department of Children and Family Services. Father Clements appealed to his pa~ishioners and later to other churches in Cook County, to respond to Chicago's lack of adoptive resources for black children. Through the cooperative efforts of the Department and Father George Clements, over twenty presentations (featuring slides of children available for adoption) have been made in Cook and several downstate counties. In January, 1981 the Illinois General Assembly passed a supplemental appropriation which provided additional funding to the Department. This funding facilitated the.h~ring of 68 adoption staff (11 of which were attorney pos1t10ns). This supplemental has led to the creation of specialized adoption units in every DCFS region. In FebruarYJ 1981 the Adoption Information Center of Illinois (AICI) was'opened. AICI features a statewide telephone hot-:\u00ad line, a photo listing book of adoptable children and potent1al adoptive families, and a public education and recruitment program. The goal of AICI is to make permanency through adoption a reality for more special needs children - especially black children. In September, 1981 a Re.~.ional Adoption Program Model was developed. The model was designated as the official document. to structure the de;velopment of/enhance existing speciaJ:-:i;oze~ adoption units in each region. The model established servi~~ standards designed to produc~ high quality services with statewide consistency. By November 15, 1981 each of the Department's eight regions had implemented the regional ~doption program model and were functioning within the frame\u00ad work of specialized adoption units. In October, 1981 the Department embarked on a major adoption recruitment effort. A campaign entitled \"I Want to be a Son - ,I want to be a Da:\\lghter\" was produced for the Department of 'Children and Family Services and the Adoption Information Center of Illinois by McCann-Erickson, a Chicago advertising agency. Staff from the Department of Children and Family Services' Office of Communication/Community Relations made personal contacts with at least 50 newspapers around the state asking publishers to run adoption ads as a public service. Over 100 radio and television stations were also contacted to participate. Response/participation by the media exceeded the Department's expectations. This particular e'ffort also focused on special needs children. -86-1 ., '.1 1 ~ r I o Legislation in the form of House Bill 985, 488 and 486 provided major reform of the adoption laws of Illinois in the past session of the General Assembly. This legislation was geared toward removing certain bureaucratic barriers from the adoption process. (It is not expected that the recent Supreme Court decision, Santosky vs. Kramer, which ruled on the standard of evidence required in termination cases will adversely effect the Department's adoption ini\u00ad tiative as adoption staff have continued to be advised to prepare the strongest case possible for termination qases.) These efforts resulted. in better adoption statistics in fiscal years 1981 and 1982~ Number of children freed Number of children placed for adoption Number of adoptions finalized Number of subsidized adoptions finalized FY 81 (7/1/80;:-6/30/81) 595 592 293 FY 82 (7/1/81-6/30/82) 731 847 798 493 DCFS has several ways in which it assures improved adoption services, some of which are mentioned in the foregoing letter. The Adoption Screening Committee comprises representatives from the State's Attorney's Office, from the Guardian Ad Litem's Office, and from DCFS. The Committee in \u20acook County presently meets three times a week for two-hour sessions. At first the Committee had fewer meetings until they realized the pressing need. At these meetings, members decide whether a case is \"court ready\" for termination of parental rights. Calendars 7 and 8 of the Cook County Juvenile Court have a four to five month backlog for hearings on contested par~ntal rights termination cases. In pis interview with our Commission staff, Veronico said that he felt another juvenile court calendar to handle these cases is necessary because after such a long delay evidence becomes stale. In his opinion, the problem in terminating parental rights is affected more by the backlog in the courts and not so much by the \"clear and convincing\" standard, with which he saw little problem. Also, there is reportedly a nationwide pI'oblem with poor case records. As of August 1, 1982, Calendar 12 has been added to hear child abuse and neglect cases at Juvenile Court. Judge Saul A.Perdomo presides. This new court rOQ~ has cut the case backlog down to two months. Of course, this backlog does not apply to temp,?rary custody hearings, ,etc., which must be heard much sponer. All new cases opened in August and\u00b7September, 1982 were assigned to Calendar 12; C~lendars 7 and 8 received no new cases. However, as of October I, 1982, new cases are assigned to the three by rotation, when petitions are approved by the State's Attorney's Office. -87-u ~-----~.----------------------------------------------~----------------------------~---------------- ---------- Termination of parental rights cases make up a relatively small percentage of the cases heard in Calendar 7, 8, and 12. ;; I' Veronico stated that DCFS is conunitted to reunification of the natural family if at all possible, so the Department is careful not to track children into adoption from the point of intake. Cook County Ju~'enile Court judges appear to be very firm that this tracking not .take place. Another problem in bringing cases to court is that DCFS case\u00ad workers do not necessarily know what is needed to present a success\u00ad ful parental rights termination case. In the winter of 1981, DCFS received a supplemental money appropriation. Through this, the Department was able to ~lace at least one attorney in each region to work with DCFS caseworkers on termination of parental rights in adoption cases. The actual parental rights termination case is presented by the Assistant State's Attorneys, not by DCFS attorneys. If the Assistant State's Attorney will not prosecute a case because he or she feels there is a lack of adequate evidence or lack of need for termination, then DCFS has no recourse. The Director of DCFS might intervene in such cases and try to negotiate with the State's Attorney's Office, but the State's Attorney's Office has the final say in these cases. DCFS has als.o been working with the State's Attorney Association to try to resolve any differences they may have on how particular cases should be handled. , , 'd 'bl f ~ , POSSl. e reason or J:.\\ursu~ng , termination of parental rights even when no adopti~~ home has been identified. He said a child whose natural parents' \\Fights had been terminated would be more attractive to potential adoutive parents because the problems associated with termination wou~;d have already been resolved. There would be less trauma and les~time involved for the adoptive family. He also mentioned some problem areas in adoptions. Certain children are difficult to place in adoptive homes, termed \"~pecial Needs\" children. They include minority children, white and> hispanic children over the age of ten, any physically or mentally handi\u00ad capped children, and sibling groups. The age requirements for adoptive parents who want \"Special Needs\" childJ;:en apparently are more liberal. Veronico outlined what DCFS is doing about the problem of adoption of black children. DCFS respects race and culture but will leave a child in its placement (even if not of the same race) if the placement has been long-term. DCFS will look for a black family to adopt a minority child for six months, though the six-month period can be waived. The preference is to place children with families of the same .racial and ethnic background. On Chicago.' s South Side, there is an adoption unit called -88-Adoption Family Development Unit, which focuses on recruiting black families. This unit has increased staffing, use of publicity and news media, ~nd local tra~ning programs for staff regarding recruit\u00ad ment s~rateg~es and,the l~ke. The staff have reviewed their criteria rega,rd~ng the adopt~ ve family. They have also been working on ways to bre~k down the myth ~hat bl~ck families don't adopt. Furthermore, there ~s a church campa~gn to ~ncrease adoptions. There have been appearances by DCFS staff and children on the Phil Donahue Show and the Lee Phillip Show, as well as articles on adoptable \"Spec; al Needs\" children in the Chicago Defender Newspaper and in the -National Enquirer. Of t~e 200 black children who were placed last year in Cook C~unty, e~ght were placed transracially. Because of DCFS' initia\u00ad tJ.ve and the Adoption Family Development Unit, there are currently no healthy black babies waiting to be adopted. , Veronico pointed ou\u00b7t a potential problem in the new law that g~ves foster parents who have had children in their care for a ye~r preferance as possible adoptive parents. The problem would a:~se when ~CFS fe~ls that t~e foster family best pos\u00ad s~ble adopt~ve fam~ly. It m~ght be argued that if DCFS was dis\u00ad pleased with the family, it shouldn't have left the child in the plac~ment ~or a year. Potentially, this new law would push DCFS to f~nd su~table placements more quickly and to seek permanent placements as early as possible. ,V~ronico,also spoke about contacts with other states. Illinois part~c~pates ~n the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, Ill., R~V. ~tat. Ch. 23, ,r1r 2601-2609, which ,.involves 44 states. Pa:t~c~pat~ng states share a photo listing book of available ch~ld:en. For ex~mple, ,a California couple could go to a private adopt~ons ~gency ~nthe~r state,l or to the state's equivalent of DCFS, seek~ng to adopt a child. Should they express interest in an Il~inois,chil<:l listed in the'book, a home study of the couple done ~n Cal~forn~a would be sent to Illinois for review\u00b7 if there are no problems to this point, a pre-placement visit to'california by the Illinois child might be made. Illinois was one of the first states to institute \"SUbsidized adoPtion~.1I Eligibility depends on the child, not on the parents. The subs~dy can cover the following: a.medi6a~ expez;se of the child; the subsidy would pay the part of a med~cal b~ll not covered by insurance; b. Fi monthly maintena:i.1ce paymep.t ,for the child, by law \u00b7the montbhllY Pfayment must be (at least) one dollar less than thA com\u00ad pa:a ~ oster care payment; this payment may continue until 'the ch~ld ~s 18 years old; it is renewable each year unless for example, the child has left home; ,. , c. legal cQsts (.a one time payment only,); -89-f I I ~. ~. ~ -----~-~----~-~~--- ~ -~~- d. special services, such as transportation (this is also a one-time payment only). The death of one or both adoptive parents (depending on the cir\u00ad cumstances) can result in the subsidy being cut off. The subsidy can apparently only go to the original adoptive parents, not to any step-parent. According to Veronico, under ~tate law the child must be a ward of the state to be eligible for the adoption subsidy. Yet another way in which DCFS is trying to improve adoptions services was developed in December, 1979. Under the Case Review system, administered by John O'Donnell, cases of children in care are reviewed administratively every six months, with an eye toward per\u00ad manence (whether in an adoptive home, a long-term foster home, or an institution). Case goals a.nd obj ecti ves, which are very specific, are reviewed at that time. Good documentation is needed for these reviews. Veronica told us that he believes the Case Review system will lessen the length of foster care stay. Once a child is placeg in an adoptive home, there is a six\u00ad month probationary period. Only after this trial period can an adoption be finalized. DCFS offers certain slervices, such as counseling, to adoptive families during the initial six months of placement. However, DCFS is more li]{e.ly to refer the family to a local organization or suggest that the family join an adoptive family support group. Should the~ family request it, DCFS will continue such services past the six-month trial period. 2. Regional Functions: Purchase of Care As we mentioned, adoptions are supervised at the state level, though each region providE~s adoption services. All other family maintenance and substi tutE~ care services are provided at the regional level. These services, along with adoptions, are used in permanency planning. In its 1982 Human Services Plan, DCFS describes the concept of permanency planning: \\ The mission of the DCFS child welfare system is\u00b7to assure that each child. in its care iSl able to obtain a permanent. secure, and nurturing 11v:Lng arrangem\\~nt. The department's commitment to permanence is based on th<:l conviction that children must have a consistent nurturing emdronment to achieve optimal growth and development. Continuity Of care by sensitive and caring adults whom the child views as hi,s own \"parents\" establishes the basis from which a child can dev~~lop a stahle adult personality. This consistency of care also el)ables the child to internalize the values and behavior which \\'i~HI promote his/her parenting ability. Permanency planning involves all aspects of direct provision of services. The 1982 Plan \\')utlines six permanency goals: -90-r 1 Family Preservation Family Reunification Adoption Long-term Placement (for older adolescents or children for whom the court will not terminate parental rights) Independence (for mature, old~r adolescents) Continuous Care (for tl}e severely handicapped child) . These goals can basically be broken into three broad categories, as they are in the 1982 Plan: Family Maintenance, S~bstitute Care, and Adoption Services. In general terms, each case ~s handled at the least \"radical\" stage possible, first through Family Maintenance, then Substitute Care, and finally Adoptions, depending on the severity of the case. Some case~ are from th~ ou~set hand~ed through substitute care or adopt~on; some beg~n w~th su~st~tute, care and end with reunification of the family; others m~ght beg~n with family maintenance services and end in adoption. In any case, preservation of the family is the primary goal if it can be achieved without jeopardizing the child's safety. \" Once DCFS becomes involved after the initial investigation and after protective custody issues have been decided, caseworkers gather information, assess Reeds, develop a tr~atrnent pla~, arrange for services and monitor progress. Most serv~ces for ch~ldren and families are'provided by persons or agencies through purchas~ of services by contract with the Department. A more complete d~scus\u00ad sion of DCFS' contractual activities is found in our section on Management and Budget. a. Family Maintenance DCFS Director Jerome Mille.r (1973-1974) emphasized bringing back to Illinois those children who had been placed in substitute care out of state, for the most part r7turning them to their, natural families if possible. He inst~tuted the current pol~cy of providing services designed to keep families intact by, for example, relieving the stress on parents that often results in ~buse and neglect. Such services fall under the category of Fam~ly Maintenance. Family Maintenance services are meant to relieve stress and to preserve and strengthen 'the family so that out of horne placement is not necessary. These services include the following: Homemakers -',l'o str~ngthenand support the parentsl capacity to care \"for their children, Homemakers teach and provide home manage\u00ad ment, consisting of meal planning and preparation, budgeting~ shop\u00ad ping, child care, light house-keeping, personal care related activities; supervise medication, dJ.et I [, Of medical equipment; and provid,e,oth, er home-management, and care ab 1 force lbis service provides a st 1 1z1ng management assistance. in the family. , ak placed in the home when the Caretakers -Tra1ned caret ers are ma1nta1ns con 1nu ~~i~~r~a~~st~~p~~~~s~~nt~~tc~~:'Child need not be placed out of the home. , 'helps to reduce the stress child Welfare Day Care -Th1S serv1ce , ome that might contribute to neglect or abu~e, a~I~W1~g 1?~::~~~: ~asic , awa from their children and ensur1ng tat e c 1 t1m~ y t Services might include recreation, education, meals need s arkeSmeph~ ysical examinations and might nelp parents ma1n a1~ a ~ schedule to better provide economically for the ch11dren.

For thEh:';e children the permanency goal is to provide as secure and nurturing a family environment as possible. For sere:ct:ed older youth who hav'e demonstrated the capability and expressed the desire to live independently, the permanency goal may be a successful transition to self-sufficient independence. Most SUbstitute care settings fall under two broad categories: foster family care and residential care; residential care involves group homes and institutions. Foster families provide a normal family environment for the child. The foster home chosen is ideally the least restrictive setting that is most similar to a natural family and most compa\u00ad tible with the child's needs, and that is in close proximity to the child's home and community. The placement is considered temporary, used until the child can be reunited with his family, adopted, or prepared for self-sufficiency. /.=C -=~~\"\" ' Residential care, provided through Group Homes and Institutions, provides to'tal substitute care for children removed from the home. Such care is also considered temporary. Group Homes and Institutions may also offer a variety of specialized programs for children with special needs, for example, unwed teenage mothers or mentally or physically handicapped children. In our interviews with DCFS caseworkers, we learned of several problems with the substitute care system. We were told that it is a constant struggle to get enough foster homes to meet DCFS needs. Periodic recruitment campaigns give low returns. Another problem is foster home drift. Though the purported goal is permanent placement as early as possible, many children remain in foster care for several years, often drifting from one home to another. This problem was attributed to DCFS' emphasis on the crisis situa\u00ad tion that causes state intervention in the first place. Protection of the child from immediate harm is considered central, so the child maybe' 'removed from the home before the possibility of stabilizing the family is thoroughly explored. Once the child is in a more stable environment in the foster home, the caseworker ;may tend, to forget him and not exercise vigilance in seeking an adoptive family. The, huge caseloads of the social workers adds to this situation; they \"are constantly working on the inunediate needs of newly referred children and cannot adequat~ly follow up children in foster care. Another big problem is staff turnover. A new social worker will tend to concentrate on those cases with more inunediate needsf letting the, children in stable situations slide. c. Follow-up of Services Purchased For the most part, the services we have been discussing are long-term and require continual mo!dtoring and r~,view by caseworkers. After the intial investigation is completed by (formerly by \"\"\"\"\"r~-~_- ~~- CPS) and the intial action taken (e.g., protective custody), the case must be turned over to caseworkers who will follow it on an on-going basis. In Cook County, DCP hands the case over to CPS. CPS follow\u00ad up is discussed in the section on the Division of Child Protection. Outside of Cook County, all functions are handled by multi-service workersL in Cook County, multi-service workers handle all follow\u00ad up except that involving abuse. G. Conclusion In this chapter, we have described the Department of Children and Family Services' several functions, focusing on the Department's attempts to protect abused and peglected chFl.dren. We.have seen that these functions are performed by, five divisions:. Child Protection, Management and Budget, \"Policy and Plans, Program Operations, and Youth and Community Services. For specific accounts of DCFS in action, see this report's case studies. DCFS ' protective services have improved in the \"last few years; {ne hotline and central register are notable examples of this improvement. But improvement must continue: DCFS is still not the efficien~ smoothly organized entity that Illinois' children need.

Early Illinois Juvenile statutory and Case Law* 9fficial response to child care in Illinois historically con\u00adsistsof the assumption of governmental control over children who either had violated the law or who were without proper parental or custodial care. Early measures treating these types of children, without dff\"ferentiation between the two, were markedly different from the measures employed today. The emphasis of the legislature in the 1800's was on confinement and institutionalization of these children. Historically, the state attempted to gain legal control over placement of children, but these attempts' were challenged in court almost as soon as statutes were enacted. We will recount a brief history of attitudes and measures on the part of the legisla\u00ad ture and the courts in Illinois to handle the problems that have evolved into what is now known as child abuse and child neg;J..ect. In 1863, the Illinois legislature enacted a statute (Ill. Priv. Laws 1863 ch. 14, \u00a78) authorizing justices of the peace to commit two categories of children between the ages of six and six\u00ad teen: (1) children who violated the criminal law and (2) children who were vagrants, destitute of proper parental care, or growing up in mendicancy, ignorance, idleness or vice. By 1869, in the case of Fletcher v. Illinois (52 Ill. 395), the Illinois Supreme Court refused to accept the concept that parents have unlimited discretionary power over their children, holding. that \"parental authority must be exercised within the bounds of reason and human\u00ad ity\".\" The court found that a father's imprisonment of his blind son in a cold, damp basement made it \"monstrous to hold that, under the pretense of sustaining authority, children must be left, with\u00ad out the protection of the law, at the mercy of depraved men and women, with liberty to inflict any species of barbarity short of actual taking of life.\" The broad commitment authority of the 1863 legislation cited above was challenged in the 1870 case of People ex reI. O'Connel~ \" v. Turner (55 Ill. 280), which involved a 14-year-old boy who had been committed to the Chicago Reform School under the general statutory authority to arrest and confine for \"misfortune.\" In a scathing attack on parens patriae (an English concept whereby a court of equity, .exercising the. Crown's paternal prerogative, could declare a child a ward of the Crown when the parents nad failed to maintain the child's welfare), the Illinqis Supreme Court ordered the boy's release on the grounds that commitment of a poor or neglected child who had not committed a crime violated his con\u00ad stitutional rights. The court in its opinion discussed parental rights and the difficulty of defining a proper standard of parental care. In declaring the neglect statute unconstitutional, the court 'statea: *See articles autho';;ed by (1) Mason P. Thomas, Jr., and (2) Dr. Rowine Hayes Brown, .l ! :; \" Ii F /: , f et al., listed in the Bibliography, both of which examine this subject in greater detail.. -95-------,---~----~--~~ ~-~---------------~------- If, without crime, without the conviction of any offense, the children of the State are to be thus confined for the \"good of I\u00ad society,\" then society had better be reduced to its original elements, and free government acknowledged a failure. , '~ Why ~~\"U'i~ children, only guilty of misfortune, be deprived of liberty without \"due process of law?\" This decision of the Illinois Supreme Court was regarded as socially irresponsible\"by the reformers who believed so strongly in institutional c~ref)?r crime preven,tion. The st':lte ~eform the de\u00ad ficiencies: commitments were limited fa criminal offenders, tne right to commit during minority was eliminated, and commitments for parental neglect were abolished. The primary significance of the case is its standard for determining when parental conduct justifies state intervention and removal of the child's custody: \"gross misconduct,or almost total unfitness ,on the part the parent . clearly proved.\" The le.gislature, in 1877, showed con\u00ad cern for these problems by approving \"[a]n act to prevent and punish wrongs to children\" (Offenses Involving Children, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 23, i 2354): <~.\\ It shall be unlawful for any person having the care or custody of any child, wilfully to cause or permit the life of such child to be endangered, or the health of such child to be in\u00ad jured, or wilfully cause or permit such child to be placed in such a situation that its life or health may be endangered. ii \\\\ Tiiis Act withstood a 1971 challenge of unconstitutional vagueness '\\\\in People v. Vandiver (51 Ill. 2d 525, 283 N.E. 2d 681). Currently, any person convicted under this Act is guilty of a Class A mis\u00ad demeanor, while any subsequent offense constitutes .a Clas~, 4 feloPlY. Three years prior to the adoption of the above act, the General Assembly had enacted a law proscribing cruelty to' children and o~hers (Offenses Involving Children, Ill. Rev. Stat.ch. 23, ! 2368), which currently reads as follows: Any person who shall wilfully'and unnecessarily expose to the inclemency of the weather, or shall in any other manner injure in health or limb, any child, apprentice or other person under his legal control, shall be guilty of a Class 4 felony. This law likewise withstood a challenge of unqpnstitutional vague\u00ad ness, in a 1978 case entitled Peoplev. Virgin (60 ,Ill. App. 3d 964,377 N.E. 2d 846). ~ o Because neglected children no longer could be committed to reform school s after the 0' Connell case, institutions under a I:\\,ew name--\"industrial schools\"--w.ere created to care for such ch~~$n , around 1875. These schools were intended for children who were legally classified as \"dependent,\" which w.as .. a term statutorily defined similar to that of a neglected child. Although such -96-I ! I schools were usually organized by private sectarian groups, they received public f'mds. The county of residence was required to pay ten dollars per month for the support of each child committed to an industrial school. The Supreme Court of Illinois on several occasions uphefd the constitutionality of the industrial school act; relying on Earens patriae, its 1870 position in the O'Connell case was reversed and the practice ,of committing neglected children to such sectarian institutions without following traditional con\u00ad cepts of legal due process was endorsed. Also receiving public funds, pursuant to an 1885 law, were private groups engaged in the investigation ,of cases involving cruelty to children and the prosecution of parents, such as the Illinois Humane Society (known as the Illinois Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals prior to 1881). This law provided that fines collected from the prosecution of cases involving cruel\u00ad ty to animals and children would be used for these agencies' sup\u00adport. Nineteenth century Illinois legislation authorizing insti\u00ad tutional commitment of neglected children, and cases interpreting these laws, reflect the sequential development of institutions under various names in which neglected children were mixed with child offenders. Child-saving organizations seemed to agree that, if society were to achieve a realistic approach to crime preven\u00ad tion I there sh,ould be,. no real distinctions between neglected chil\u00ad dren (then legally classified as \"dependent\") and child offenders. Establishment in 1899 of a juvenile court in Cook County, Illinois, marked the first implementation of a separate judicial framework whose sole concern was directed to problems and miscon\u00ad duct of youth. The redefinition of the state's relationship to the child was not really an innovation but rather was based on the old English concept of parens patriae. Civic, social and professibnal leaders in Chicago, concerned over the punitive applications of the criminal law to child of\u00ad fenders and the large number of children who were then confined in local jails and county poorhouses, provided the momentunl fo~ the establishment of the first juvenile court. In 1898, a comml.ttee of social leaders and lawyers was formed to draft a bill ,and work for its enactment. The bill, entitled \"An act to regulate the tr.eatment and control of dependent, neglected and delinquent children,\" was enacted by the General Assembly near the end 9f its 1899 session (see Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 37,! 701-1 et seg.). The juvenile court wa~ a product of political compromi~e be\u00ad tween private sectarian interests that operated the industrl.al schools and state welfare ~uthorities who believed stron.gly in state':'operated ins,titutions for dependent and neglected children. The 1899 juvenile court' law continued the blurring of distinctions between neglected, dependent and delinquent children and the prac\u00adtice of mixing these children in the same institutions. Like the industrial schools that preceded it\" the juvenile court possessed -97- \u00ab t ----~~~.~pu--~ .. ----------------------------~------------~--~-------------------------------------------------------~-------------------- r I /. I broadly defined jurisdiction over neglected children, with little thought having been given to the rights of parents and children. The terms, IIdependentll and IIneglectedll were used interchangeably in the 1899 juvenile court law, and these terms were defined in words describing conditions believ,ed to l-ead to crime in the early nineteenth century: the definition included any child under age 16 who for any reason is destitute or homeless or abandoned; or de\u00ad pendent upon the public for support; or h!'is not proper parental care or guardianship; or who habitually begs or receives alms; or who is found living in any house of ill fame or with any vi\u00ad cious or disreputable p'ersoni or whose home, by reaSon of neglect, cruelty or depravity on the part of its parents, guardian or other person in whqse care it may be, is an unfit place for such a child; and any child under the age of 8 years who is found peddling or selling any article or singing or playing any musical instrument upon the streets or giving any public entertairunent. The 1899 Illinois statute incorporated the concept of parens patriae by providing that lithe care, custody and discipline of a child shall approximate as nearly as may be that which should be given by its parents ...... It encouraged family placements that would result in adoption, and it gave the individuals or agencies to whom a child was committed broad authority over the child as guardian of the IIward.\" Such individuals or agencies were given certain parental rights, including the right to place the child in a family home and to consent to the child's adoption without notice to or approval of the child's parents. The general aim of the law was to displace certain broadly defined 'types of parents who were viewed as failures and to substitute ,the state as parens patriae. The Chicago juvenile court system became the model for jUVt~n\u00adile court legislation that was rapidly adopted throughout the \" United states. By 1909, twenty states and the District of Col~bia had en~cted such laws; all but three states had a juvenile court, system 'by 1920. with the development of the juvenile court, the law of ne\u00ad glect changed somewhat. Juvenile court statutes began stressing issues, of parental fault, parental actions or omissions, moral enviro~~ent, adequacy of physical care, and a proper home. Courts, in interpreting these statutes, began incorporating the standard of the IIbest interests of the child.1I Because of the expansion of juvenile probation services under the juvenile court movement, the need to remove ,children from their homes by institutional commitments for protective reasons\" has declined. The availability of juvenile probation' services has provided a new resource for supervising children in their homes. The juvenile courts in Illinois had furnished protective ,services for youngsters, originally secured from private, voluntary ~gencies dependent upon community money-raising activities. -98-In 1963, the General Assembly created the Depa~tment of Children and Family Services (see Ill. Rev. Stat. cit. 23, \u00abj[ 5001 et seq.), in response to recommendations of the Illinois Report for the 1960 White House Conference on Children and Youth. Since the creation of this department, the Juvenile Court has utilized the protective services available through it. Few have decried the very existence of the juvenile court or ~uestioned.seriously its underlying premises. Most objections are 1n derogatlon of what the juvenile court has become, since its pro\u00ad cedures have been altered gradually to confontl to requirements of th7 ~nite~ States ~onstitution. See, for example, dissenting oplnlons ln two Unlted States Supreme Court cases--In re Winship8 397 U. S. 358, 375-76 (1970) (Chief Justice Burger dissenting) and In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 78-81 (1967) (Justice Stewart dissenting). Modern critics state that the juvenile process has been en\u00ad dowed with all the trappings of the criminal process and has lost its informal, nonadversary character. It is well to remember, how\u00ad ever, that at the same time the juvenile court established a benevolent, protective, nonadversary relationship between the child and the state, it also effected a loss of procedural rights upon children, a loss that was obscured for over half a century in at\u00ad t7mpting to serve th~ best interests of the child. Throughout the hlstory of the juvenile court movement, children have been denied procedural rights that they had enjoyed previously, on the basis that the proceeding was civil and not criminal, that it was a non~ adversary proceeding, and that the juvenile court was able to pro\u00ad tect the interests of the child as well as serve the interests of society. Reforms protecting against procedural arbitrariness, while altering the procedural setting, have not prevented the juvenile court from attaining its basically ameliorative purposes, parti\u00ad cularly at the dispositional stage. The protective policy has en\u00ad dured. Only by assuring a child of procedural fairness will a court be able to truly represent the child's interests and fulfill the state's now commonly accepted role of parens patriae. B. The General Framework for Child Protection According to Brian G. Fraser, former Executive Director of the National Committee for Prevention of Child Abuse, who was in\u00ad terviewed by Commission staff members ,there al:e four factors in\u00ad digenous to child abuse. We will repeat them here: (1) Because it is li~ely that one\" or both abusing parents were physically a~used, neglected or deprived as children, child abuse apparently is ,a learned or conditioned behavior. (2) Abusing parents are isolated and have no friends, relatives or neighbors who can be called upon in time of crisis. (3) The parents have unrealistic expectations of their children. J4) There is usually a crisis of some sort wh~ch precedes and precipitates the abusive incident. When these four factqrs coalesce in a family, child abuse is likely to occur. -99-\" ~---~-------------~---~~~---- Child abuse legislation, if it is to be effective, must re\u00ad spond to all of the above problems. It must create a mechanism which combines different disciplines and different forms of ex\u00ad pertise, according to Fraser, which will lead ~o a mo:e.effect~ve delivery system and resolution of the complex 1ssues 1nvolved 1n child abuse. The current child abuse system is remedial, becoming opera\u00ad tional only after the child has been abused . Fra~e: id7ntifie~ the three steps that are involved: (1) the.ldent:f1c~t10n of the child believed to have been abused, (2) an 1nvest1gat10n to.deter\u00ad mine if the child actually has been abused, and (3) the de11very of se~vicesand treatment to the abused child and his family. Identification. Every state has enacted into law a mandatory reporting statute to ensure that report~ are made and to facili\u00ad tate the reporting process. All report1ng statutes have a co~o~ purpose and format, but there is little uniformity because def1n1- tions, standards and procedures vary from state to stCite: ~t~te statutes typically define child abuse, mandate ~elected ~nd1v1duals (usually professionals) to report when they be11eve a ch1ld ~as been abused, designate at least one st~tew1de agency ~o rece1ve and investigate reports, provide immun1ty for good fa~th reports or provide criminal or civil provisions for non-com~11an~e.to en\u00ad courage reporting, and abrogate the status of ce:ta1n.pr1v1leged communications. While effective child abuse leg1slat10n mus~ provide a mechanism to ensure that all cases of suspected Chlld abuse are properly identified and reported, any concerted effort to increase the number of reports must be matched wit~ an ef~ort to increase the capacity of the system to deal effect1vely w1th those reports. Investigation. When a report of su~pecte~ c~ild abuse is re'\u00ad ceived by the appropriate state agency (l.n Il11n01s, the.Department of Children and Family Services), it is screened and ass1gned.to an agency caseworker for investigation. While all future ~ct:ons will hinge on this investigation, Fraser feels that the maJor1ty of child abuse investigations are neither thorough nor properly co~\u00ad ducted. The amount of time available to inve~tigate each case 15 decreasing because the n~er of suspected ch1ld abuse repor,ts _has increased dramatically wh1le the number of ag~ncy personnel re sponsible for investigating the reports has not incr7ased ~ubstan\u00ad tially One caseworker usually must formulate thed1agnos1s, and the treatment plan.,. Because on7 ~ndiv~du,:,-l :arely has substantive experience in all of the requ1s1t7 d1sc1pl1nes, child abuse legislation should provide for cooperat10n betw7en agen\u00ad cies, training and education of expertise of differe~t profe~s~onals. Ch1ld abuse.17g1slat10n ~ust address Voluntary 1I?pl7menta tion is monitored by the caseworker, who withdraws when 1t 1S -100-I J I, believed that the home environment has stabilized. Voluntary in\u00ad tervention is not appropriate in certain instances, however. For example, when the parents are unwilling to cooperate, the prognosis is poor, the injuries are severe, or there is a pattern of past abuses, involuntary intervention, i.e., implementation and moni\u00ad toring of the treatment plan by a court, is indicated. A model child abuse reporting statute was proposed in 1963 by the Children's BUreau of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare (now Health and Human Services), and two other models were developed by the American Medical Association ana the Council of State Governments in 1965. All fifty states adopted some form of child abuse reporting statute between 1963 and 1967. In January, 1974, the President of the United States signed into law the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 SlOl-Sl07) allocating federal money for the identification, treatment and prevention of child abuse, part of which was soeci\u00ad fically earmarked for state use. For a state to be eligible-for these funds it must: (1) Provide for the reporting of known or suspected child abuse. (2) Provide for an investigation by a properly constituted state authority upon receipt of a report of known or sus\u00ad pected child abuse. This investigation must be made promptly and if there is a finding of child abuse, the state must provide immediate act.ion'to protect the health and welfare of the abused or neglected child or any other child in the same home. (3) Demonstrate that there are in effect administrative pro\u00ad cedures, trained personnel, training procedures, institu\u00ad tional and other facilities and multidisciplinary programs and services sufficient to assure that the state can deal effectively and efficiently with child abuse. This must include provisions for the receipt, investigation and veri\u00ad fication of reports; provision for the determination of treatment and ameliorative social services and medical needs; provision of such services; and recourse to the criminal or juvenile court where necessary. (4) Have in effect a child abuse and neglect law that provides civil and criminal immunity for persons who report in good faith. (5) Preserve the confidentiality of all records concerning re\u00ad ports of child abuse and neglect by having in effect a law that makes such records confidential and make's any person who perm:i\"ts or encourages the unauthorized dissemination of such records or their contents guilty of a crimc~. (6) Establish cooperation among law enforcement officials, courts of competent jurisdiction, and all appropriate state agencies providing human services for the prevention, treat\u00ad ment and identification of child abuse ...,.....---.~~- .. -~------------~------------~....----.-------------------~----------- -------~~-- '.-,-..;.-------- 1\\ (7) Ensure that in every case of child abuse that results in a judicial proceeding there is an appointment of a Guardian Ad Litem to represent the child. (8) Show that the aggregate of state support for programs or projects related to child abuse is not reduced below the level provided during the fiscal year 1973. (9) Provide for public dissemination of information on the problem of child abuse as well as the facilities and the prevention and treatment methods available to combat it. (10) To the extent feasible, insure that parental organizations combating child abuse and neglect receive preferential treatment. , Child,abuse for protective purposes. The report~ng laws were added to an existing legal framework that al\u00ad r~ady ~rovided for stat~ intervention to protect children in f~ed c~rcumstances. Th~s legal framework included criminal statutes a~d,case precedents that limited excessive parental discipline, c~v~l ~aw p~eceden\u00b7ts that governed child custody disputes, various state J~ven~le ~ourt acts, and state legislation that provided for protect~ve serv~ces. The separate parts of this framework have de\u00ad veloped somewhat independently so that legislatures, courts and scholars have seldom examined the framework as a whole in order to evaluate its effectiveness for child protection. C. Illinois Legislation Impacting on the Child Abuse Problem Ultimately, \u00b7the prevention and treatment of child abuse and neglec-t;: depend less on laws and more on the existence of suffic!~ent and ~u:-tab17 helping services for children and parents. A law uay proh~b~t ch~ld abuse and neglect, and may mandate the rehabilita\u00ad tion of parents, but it cannot prev~nt or cure child abuse and ne\u00ad glect, nor can it rehabilitate parents. At best, a law c~n estab\u00ad lish the institutional framework for the protection of<chi\\~ldren . and it can enunciate the philosophy that will guide a syst~\\m as' it deals with the individual problems of children and parents .\\\\ '\\\\ A summary of Illinois statutes that shape the frame~Tork'\\0f child protection in this state follows. Included, also, are s~~\u00ad opses of selected legislation amending the pertinent acts in s\u00b7ig\\;,. nificant ways, which was passed recently by the 82nd General As\u00ad ~embly and signed into law. Only that legislation dealing with ~ss-qes relevant to the Commission' s i,nve~tigation is discussed. (These amendments are discussed following the description of each act, and are referred to as \"Public Act 82- .\") 1. Adoption Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 40, ~~ 1501-1529.

Effective January 1, 1960.) (Approved 1959. a. Public Ac\u00b7t 82-437 provides that a termination pro\u00ad ceeding can take place \"without regard to the likelihood that the child will be placeCl for adoption.\" Previously, an adoptive family had to be identified before a determination was made regarding the termination of parental rights due to the parent being unfit. b. This Act amended in several respects the statutory grounds for parental unfitness in termination proceedings. Most importan\u00b7tly the definition of unfitness is rewritten to include a parent's failure to visit or communicate with the child as a ground. The court no longer must require a showing of diligent efforts by the a~thorized agency to encourage the parent to maintain contact with the child. It now is the parent's responsibility to strengthen the relationship with the child within twelve months after the ne\u00ad glect or dependent adjudication. c .. The Act,gives any person over the age of eighteen who has cared for a child for a continuous period of one year as a foster parent the right to apply to the child's guardian for consent to adoption. The guardian must give preference and first consideration to this person's application. Juvenile Court still is the final authority as to the propriety of the adoption. d. Public Act 82-225 provides that a parent's consent to adoption can be challenged by the parent on the grounds that it had been obtained by fraud or under duress or on any other grounds only within twelve months from the date the consent was executed. Previously, there had been no limitations period for actions to void or revoke a consent to adoption. e. Public Act 82-224 provides that a child whose parent signs a final .irrevocable consent to adoption or surrender, or whose parent is found unfit, is no longer to be considered a \"re\u00ad lated child,\" and such a parent is no longer to be considered a \"parent of the child\" who, before this amendment! had been granted certain rights in the future adoption of the chiid 2. Interstate Compact on Juveniles, Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 23, ~~ 2591-2597. This Compact is an agreement between all states that provides, in relevant part, for the return to their home state of nondelinquent juveniles who have ru.n away from home. (Approved August 1, 1961. Effective August 1, 1961.) 3. Criminal Laws. The Criminal Code of 1961 1 Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 38, '.I[~ 1-1 et seg., is replete with criminal offenses possibly applicable to child abuse and child abuse resulting in death; therefore, no attempt will be made here to discuss the en\u00ad tire range of possible charges. Worthy of special note,;t however, because it became law so recently (December 18, 1980) I 'i'8 \"aggra\u00ad vated battery of a child\" (Ill. Rev. stat. Ch. 38, ~ 12-4.3), which makes the infli9tion of \"great bodily harm or permanent dis\u00ad ability or disfigp.remen\u00b7t to any child under the age of 13 year~\" a Class 2 felony. -103-, \" i I,\"' \"\"II1II:' 1P ...,..~ J 1\\ \\ A new addition to the Criminal Code of 1961 is as follows: a. Public Act 82-677 adds an \"aggravating factor\" in murder convictions. A defendant who at the time of the commission of the offense has attained the age of 18 or more and has been found guilty of murder may be sentenced to death if the murdered individual was under sixteen and the death resul'ced from exception\u00ad ally brutal or heinous behavior indicative of wanton cruelty. A new addition to the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 is as follows: b. Public Act 82-228 provides that whenever a peace officer arrests a person, the officer must question the arrestee as to whether he or she has children under the age of eighteen who may be neglected as a result of the arrest. If this is the case, the officer must assist the arrestee in placing the children in the care of a responsible person. When the officer has reasonable cause to believe the child is neglected, he must report it imme\u00ad diately to the Department of Children and Family Services. When a judge ascertains that an arrestee has children under eighteen who may be neglected as a result of the arrest, he must instruct a probation officer to report it immediately to the Department of Children and Family Services. See Section E of the In~roductory Chapter of this report for a synopsis of other new criminal laws which had been sponsored or supported by this Commission during the last session of the General Assembly. In addition to the two criminal offenses involving children discussed in Section A of this Chapter (Ill. Rev. Stat.Ch. 23, \u00abj[\u00abj[ 2354, 2368), prosecution for \"child abandonment,\" a Class 4 felony (Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch:\"-.23, ~ 2361), as well as other specific statutory offenses against children codified in Chapter 23 of the Illinois Revised Statutes, is feasible. 4. Department of Children and Family Services Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 23, \u00abj[\u00abj[ 5001-5035.1. The purpose of this Act is to create a Department of Children and Family Services to provide social ser\u00ad vices to children and their families, to operate children's insti\u00ad tutions, and to provide certain other rehabilitative and residen\u00adtial services as enumerated in the Act. (Approved June 4, 1963. Effective January 1, 1964.) a. Public Act 82-726 provides for, among other things, moving children in the care of the Department toward the most per\u00ad manent living arrangement and permanent legql status possible. To this end, a new,case plan and case tracking system is implement~d. b. Public Act 82-969 establishes a Division of Youth and Community Services to be adm.inistered by the Department. 5. Juvenile Court Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 37, 1'1' 701-1-- 708-4.

(The law and procedure under this Act is highlighted in Section E of this chap\u00ad ter.) (Approved August 5, 1965. Effective January 1, 1966.) a. Public Act 82-223 amended a substantial portion of the Juvenile Court Act. The neglect adjudication is completely re\u00ad written to be consistent with the Abused and Neglected Child Re\u00ad porting Act definition and restructured into a subsection for \"Neglected Minor\" and a subsection for \"Abused Minor.\" Those ne\u00ad glect cases which must be reported now are the same aS,those cases which may, if necessary, be prosecuted under the Juven1le Court Act. Also, the legislature eliminated that category of a \"Neglected Minor\" whose behavior was .injurious to the welfare of others. The Law now reads as follows (additions to the law effected by this Act are indicated by underline~ deletions are indicated by s~r~kee~~s): Sec. 2-4. Neglected or Abused Minor. (1) Those who are neglected include any minor under 18 years of age.:.. ~at whose parent or other person responsible for the minor's welfare does not provide the wae-~e-Re~\u00b1eeEee-ae-Es proper or necessary support, education as required by law, or ae-ES medical or other remedial care recognized under State law as e~-e~e~ eare necessary for a minor's a!:s neces:. sary for his orhe~well-being, including,adequate food, clothing and shelter, or who is abandoned by his or her parents..,. or other person responsible for the minor's\u00b7welfare. ~a~e!:aR-e~-e~eEee!:aR..,. ~~t--wfteee-el'lv!:reml\\el'le-!:s-!:l'!;l:l!!'ie~s-ee-a!:s~we~~e.re-e!!'-w'h.ese beAa\u00a5~e!!'-!:e-!:l'l;l:l~!:el:lS-ee-Aie-ewR-we\u00b1~are-e~-~aae-ef-eeAe!!'s~ (2) Those who are abused include any minor under 18 years of age: Ca) whose l?arent or inunediate family member, or any person responsible for the minor's welfare, or any person who is in the same family or household as the minor, or any individual re\u00ad siding in the same home as the minor, or a paramour of the minor's parent: (i) inflicts, causes to be inflicted, or allows to be in\u00ad flicted upon such minor. physical injury, by other -105-\" \u00b7 . .-k' , ~----~- ~-- -----------------~--~-------- ~ means, which causes death, disfigurement, impairment of physical or emotional healthJ or loss or impairment of any bodily function; (ii) creates a substantial risk of physical injury to such minor by other than accidental means which would be likely to cause death, disfigurement, impairment of emotional health, or loss or impairment of any bodily function; (iii) commits or allows to be committed any sex offense:? \" against such minor, as such sex offenses are defined in the '.. Criminal Code of 1961, as amended, and extending those defini\u00ad tions of sex offenses to include minors under 18 years of age; (iv) commits or allows to be committed an act or acts of torture upon such minor; or (v) inflicts excessive corporal punishment; or (b) whose environment is injurious to his or her welfare. (For informational purposes, the definition of a, dependent minor under the Juvenile Court Act is any minor who is without a parent, guardian, or legal custodian. (Most commonly, a child is d~pendent if he or she is wit~9ut proper care because of the physical or mental disability of tn,e parent, guardian or custodian. The disability may be mental or physical illness, alcohol:j,.sm or drug addiction. The essential ele\u00ad ment is that the disability results in lack of proper care for the child. \\' (Additionally, a\\ dependent child is one who has a parent, guardii=ln, or custodian who with good causes wishes to be relieved for all residual parental rights and responsibilities [i.e., those, rights and responsibilities that remain with the parent after the transfer of legal custody or guardianship of the child], guardian\u00ad ship or custody and who desires the court to appoint for the child a guardian who may consent to th\\~ child's adoption. (Finally, a dependent ch:i,ld includes,a minor who is without proper medical 01:' other remeqial care recognized under state law or other care necessary for <Ilis or her well being through no fault, neglect or lack of concern by his parents, guardian or custodian. Parental rights cannot be terminated, nor can the child be removed from the custody of his or her parents for longer than six months, if the dependency is based upon this latter definition.) b. Public Act 82-453 provides th~t after a c,purt pre\u00ad scribes shelter care and orders such placement for a mi'nor, the minor may not b~ returned home without court involvement. ') c. Public Act 82-233 (d,iscussed in part alrEj!ady under subsection a, above) also details in very specific provisions those -'I 06-l f1 i K \" ~ t ~ :~ f 1- .~ t~ ~ 1 1 r ~ I f i J statements and conditions which are admissible in evidence of abuse or neglect in adjudicatory hearings. The following now constitute prima facie evidence of abuse or neglect: medical diagnosis of battered child syndrome, failure to thrive syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, or withdrawal symptoms from narcotics or barbiturates at birth; or injuries sustained by a minor that ordinarily would not exist \"except by reason of acts or omissions of the parent, cus\u00ad tod,ian or guardian\" i or the repeated use of addictive drugs by the \"parent, custodian or guardian. d. The aforementioned Act makes proof of the abuse or neglect of one minor admissible evidence on'the issue of the abuse or neglect of any other minor for whom the parent, custodian or guardian is responsible. The admissibility of othe.r types of evi\u00ad dence is also liberalized under this Act. e;. Public Act 82-437 provides that if a child is over fourteen, the court may consider the child's wishes in determining whether the best interests of the child would be promoted by a finding that the parent is unfit so that parental rights can be terminated. f. Public Act 82-437 reduces the standard of proof in termination proceedings. Prior to' this Act, courts terminated par\u00ad enta.l righ,ts to free children for adoption only when the parents were found to be unfit by \"clear and convincing\" evidence (unless the parents consented to the termination). This Act provides that a finding of unfitness of a nonconsenting parent is to be based only upon a \"preponderance\" of the evidence, unless the parents are minors, mentally ill or mentally deficient. This reduction in the standard of proof is now unconstitutional. On March 24, 1982, the U.S. Supreme Court rendered its decision in Santosky v. Kramer (455 U.S. 745). At issue was a New York law re\u00ad quiring that only a \"fair preponderance of the evidence'\" support a finding of unfitness in parental tlarmination proceedings. It was held thatbef'ore a state may sever completely and. irrevocably the rights of parents to their natural ~hild, due process requires that the'state support its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidence. (But cf ... : Lassiter v. Department of Social Services, 452 U.S. 18 [1981J, wherein the U.S. Supreme Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause does not require the ap\u00ad pointment of counsel for indigent parents in every parental status termination proceeding~) g.

Crime Victims\u00b7 Compensation Act, Ill. Rev. stat. Ch. 70, !! 70--90. This Act provides for compensation of victims of cer\u00ad tain violent crimes and dependents of deceased victims for their pecuniary loss. While no compensation is to be paid to a victim who lives in the same household as the assailant at the time of applying for or receiving compensation, it is conceivable that the typical victim of child abuse could be eligible for compensation under certain circumstances (e.g., in instances where the perpetra\u00ad tor no longer resides in the child's home). Compensatioh may be made for medical, psychiatric and other e~penses. (Approved Aug\u00ad ust 23, 1973. Effective October 1, 1973.) 8. Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children., Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 23, ii 2601-2609. Over forty sta\u00b7tes, including Illinois, have enacted this Interstate Compact. Its stated pur\u00ad pose and policy is to promote cooperation and sharing between states in the placement of children in their care. It covers the placement of children in adoptive and foster homes located outside of Illinois, as well as out-of-state placements in a child care agency or institution where adoption is not contemplated (with some exceptions). 'The desired result of the Compact is that every child who requires a placement shall receive the maximum oppor\u00ad t9nity to be placed in a suitable environment and with per,sons or iqstitutions having appropriate qualifications and facilities to provide a necessary and desirable degree and type of care. (Ap-\" proved September 5, 1974. Effective October 1, 1974.) 9. Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 23, ii 2051-2061.7. This Act requires certain enumerated man\u00ad dated reporters (listed below) Any physician, hospital, hospital administrator and per\u00ad sonnel engaged in examination, care and treatment of persons, surgeon, dentist, osteopath, chiropractor, podiatrist, Christian Science practitioner, coroner, medical examiner, school personnel, truant office~, social worker, social services administrator, registered nurse, licerised practical nurse, director or staff assistant of a nursery school or a child day care center, law enforcement officer, registered psycllologist, o~ field personnel of the Illinois Department of Public Aid or the Department of public Health, Department of Mental Health/~hd Devel~pmental Disabilities, Department of co:t:;;rections,,,,~~:/fobation o~llicer 'or any other child care or [Ill.

The privileged quality of communication between any professional person required to report and his patient or cli\u00ad ent is abrogated, and' does not constitute grounds for failure to :-eport as required by this Act. Any otqer.person m~y make a report 1f such person has reasonable cause to be11eve a ch1ld may be abused or neglected. This Act requires the Department of Children and (! .~\\ (l -108-I' \"':i Family Services, upon its receipt of such reports, to protect the best interest of the child, offerprotec.tive services in order to prevent any further harm to the child and to other children in the family, stabilize the home environment and preserve family life whenever possible. This Act generally implements requirements of federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, discussed in Section B of this Chapter. (Approved June 26, 1975. Effective July 1, 1975.) (Also, this Act was substantially revised by Pub\u00adlic Act 81-1077; approved September 27, 1979; effective July 1, 1980. ) a. Public Act 82-453 provides t,hat \"any person who know\u00ad ingly transmits a false report to the Department commits the of\u00ad fense of disorderly conduct under subsection (,a) (7) of Section 26-1 of the 'Criminal Code of 1961.'\" . b. The aforementioned Act also authorizes hospital ad\u00ad ministrators to give physicians who are keeping children in custody within the hospital the right to perform emergency medical treat\u00ad ment upon these children, under certain circumstances. c. The aforementioned Act requires the Department to maintain a list of unfounded cases in the Central Registry when the subject of the unfounded report requests that the record not be expunged. The subject of the unf.ounded report must base this request on the alleged claim that the report was made in an inten\u00ad tionally false manner. d. This same Act adds a new group of persons allowed access to the reports on file in the Central Registry. This new 'group includes \"law enforcement agencies, physicians, courts, and child welfare agencies in other states [emphasis added] who are involved in suspected or indicated cases of child abuse or neglect and request information from the Department to aid in their assess\u00ad ment and s'ervice. II 10. Domestic Violence Act6 Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 40, ii 2301- 1--2303-5. This new Act, which includes provisions amending other statutes also, expands the civil and criminal remedies for victims of domestic violence by enabling civil and criminal courts to quickly issue a protective order, enforceable by the police and carrying criminal penalties, to ba~ the abuser from the home. The new order will replace the current civil injunction, which can take as long as four to six weeks to obtain. It also will replace a juvenile court protective order, often used to separate an adult and child in incest and sexual abuse cases. (Approved '3eptember' 24, 1981. Effective March 1, 1982.) 11. Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation Treatment Centers Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 23, !! 2081-2087. This new Act directs the Department of Ch,ildren and Family Services to provide f~r the.t:-eat\u00ad ment and counseling of ~exually abused children and the1r fam1l1es, whenever possible, through community-based grants, when such sexual abuse or exploitation was inflicted by the child's i~ediate care- -109-\u00b7----~-~--- -.- ~ giver. The purpose clause of this Act characterizes its mandate as a program design~d to ameliorate, reduce, and ultimately eliminate the trauma of ch~ld sexual abuse and exploitation. (Certified November 12, 1981. Effective July 1, 1982.) D. Criminal Prosecution of Abusing Parents . Over thirty-five states have statutes covering cruelty to ch~ldren (see Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 23, CJ[CJ[ 2354, 2368 discussed'in Section A of this chapter). state penal codes which cover homicide and general assault and battery cases apply to a parent's or care\u00ad taker's bringi~g about the death of a 7hild or inflicting physical harm upon a ch~ld. The plethora of cr~minal offenses with which a child abu~er in Illinois already can be charged militates against recolnmend~ng the enactment of any new Criminal Code legislation to deal with the problem. It was indicated during the Commission's investigation that prosecution for child abuse is more likely in cases of sexual abuse seve:e in~ury 0: death, and abuse by non-parents. Many professionals deal~~g w~th ch~l<:l abuse and neglect advise prosecution ex\u00ad cept ~n unusual c~rcumstances. Reasons given include: (1) Criminal courts do not have power to order treatment for family members who are not defendants (e.g., the spouse and child), and they lack the necessary support services to implement effective supervision and t:eat~en't. (~) Criminal prosecution may make the parent less coopera\u00ad t~ve ~n rem~d~al procedures. (3) Criminal prosecution is less likely to <:leter.ch~ld abuse than other criminal acts. (4) Criminal prose\u00ad cut~ons ~n abuse and neglect cases are difficult because of eviden\u00ad tiary problems( the standard of proof required (beyond a reasonable doubt), and the prohibition against self-incrimination. One Commission recommendation, to be discussed later in this chapter, suggests legislative guidelines for when child abuselilnd neg~ect rep<?rts should the desirability of legis\u00ad lat~vely mandat~ng that certain types of cases be referred to ~the ~ppropriate law enforcement officials for investigation, no attempt ~s made to recrnnmend actual prosecution in any specific category of case. Such decisions must be made strictly on a case-by-case'basis. Once a case is referred for criminal investigation, a coordinated effor; between t~e Dep~rtment of Children and Famly Services anp. State s Attorney s Off~ce should lead to the best course of action. A prosecutor's decision whether to accept alternative therapy in lieu of prosecution should depend on a reasonable evaluation of the plan's legitimacy and its responsiveness to agreed-upon goals. Another suggestion for further coordinating civil and criminal functions involved the role of juvenile and criminal courts: Cri\u00ad minal prosecution for child abuse would be permitted only upon re\u00ad quest of the juvenile' court once a.petition has been filed, and a gu~rdi~n ad.l~tem would be ~ppointed.to monitor and represent the cr~m~nal court act~ons. Th~s concept warrants further re,\u00ad search in the ongoing quest to facilitate. increased coordination of the civil and criminal facets of child abuse cases. -110-r i ~ t I, I \"f r t \"\\ ~I . t\\ I --<--,------ One our Commissioners, W. Timothy Simms, has in\u00ad troduced Senate Bill 1564, which would create \"The Abused Child Shield Law of 1982.\" Basically, this legislation is intended to provide an alternative to the personal appearance in court of a child who is the victim of sexual or physical abuse. The law would permit the State's Attorney to question the child in the judge's chambers while the testimony is being videotaped. The videotape then would be played in court as evidence. The defendant's at\u00ad torney would have the right to cross-examine the child. The State's Attorney may request that the judge order the de\u00ad fendant physically excluded during the videotaping of the testi\u00ad mony. If this happens, the videotape first must be shown to the defendant and his attorney, whereupon the attorney would be afforded the right to cross-examine the child. The taping can be made at any time after the crime has occurred, even before the accused has been identified or arrested. If this should be the case, the court shall appoint a public defender to represent the \"John Doe\" defendant and cross-examine the child. Senate Bill 1564 pcissed out of the Senate but failed to pass out of the (:11se. E. Overview of Juvenile Court Proceedings Within 24 hours of its receipt of an abused or neglected child report, the Department of Children and Family Services must begin an investigation. Pursuant to its own rule, the Department is sup\u00ad posed to refer the following types of cases to the appropriate State's Attorney for consideration of criminal investigation or other action: 1. Reports in which a child is dead on arrival or dies after admission to a hosp~ tal as a result of suspected abuse or neglect~ and 2. Reports in which the ~nJury to the suspected abused or neglected child is severe, such as, but not limited to, ., fractures, burns, and subdural hematoma; and 3. Reports in which credible evidence is found that a child has been abused a second time, regardless of severity; .~,; and 4. Reports of physical injury when evidence indicates that the child has been tortured. Additionally, the Department shall refer to the appropriate state\"$ Attorney cases in which it is determined that the chi~d is in severe jeopardy from physical or sexual abuse or neglect and in need o~ protection beyond that which can be provided through comprehens~ve protective casework services.

Upon the Department's receipt of a report, it may offer so\u00ad cial services to the family without having a petition alleging neglect filed in the Juvenile Court of Cook, County. Under both the Juvenile Court Act and the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act (both of which were discussed in section C of this chapter), a child may be taken into \"temporary protective custody\" under certain circumstances. Any minor who is found in any street or public place suffering from any sickness or injury requiring care can be taken into temporary custody without a war\u00ad rant by a law enforcement official. A minor may also be taken into temporary, custody by a law enforcement official, employee of the Department'of Children and Family Services,' or a treating phy\u00ad sician without obtaining the consent of the parents or custodian under three conditions: (1) where there is an imminent danger to the child's life or health, (2) where the parent or custodian is unavailable or has refused to give consent to removal, and (3) where there is no time to apply for a court order for temporary custody. If the Department's investigation reveals a child is dependent, neglected, or abused, a petition for adjudication or wardship is filed. Natural parents, guardians, legal custodians, or responsible relatives must be notified of the temporary custody hearing. At this hearing, the state's Attorney presents the case for the State. Witnesses usually include social workers, police officers, the minor, and his parents. Hearsay evidence is admissible, and testi\u00ad mony can be compelled notwithstanding the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination unless the witness faces or is likely; to face criminal charges as a result of the testimony. In addi-,,~ tion to the State's Attorney, the child's attorney (usually the\"i guardian ad litem, who must recommend to the court what is .best for the child) and'the parent's attorney (apppinted by the court, usually from the Public Defender's office, if the parents cannot afford an attorney) also examine, the witnesses. After each party has presented its case, the court must either (I) find there is probable cause to believe the child is neglected, abused or dependent, or (2) dismiss the case. If probable cause is found, the court next must d.etermine whether removal o~ the chi~d from the home is a matter.: of immediate and urgent necess1ty for h1s protection. If it is, th,~ child can be placed with. a relative, in a foster home, or with a private welfare agency. E1ther the rela\u00ad tive or the Department of Children and Family serv~ces.is th7n a~\u00ad pointed \"temporary custodian\" of the minor. A soc1al 1nvest1gat10n of the parents, usually conducted by the Department, is then ordered to be completed wi thin thirty days, in order to formulate a pli,3.ce\u00b7\" ment plan for the child. After being apprised of the results of the inv@stigation, the State's Attorney at a status hearing (held thirty days after the temporary custody hearing) informs the court ,;:: -114-, ' ,to r i,. : (i .:\\ , j 1 u whether it will seek af~nding of neglect, abuse, or dependency, or seek to return the ch1ld t<? the parents under court supervision. If the parents do not agree W1 th the disposi.tion sought by the State's Attorney, the case is set for an adjudicatory hearing. The issue~ t<? be. decided at an adjudicatory hearing, which ,< must be hel~ w1th1n n1nety days of the filing of the petition un\u00ad less otherw1se agreed, are (1) whether the child is abused, neglect\u00ad ed or dependent, and (2) whether the child should be adjudged a ward o~ the court. At the adjudicating hea:T'ing, the burden of proof 1S a preponderance of the evidence, arld because the rules of evidence fo: civil proceedings apply, hearsay lis inadmissible. ~fter all s1des have presented their case, the judge makes a find- 1ng of neglect or dependency: otherwise, the case is dismissed. If found to be neglected or dependent, the minor must be adjudged a ward of the court so t4.at the court can continue to exercise jurisdiction over the child and parents. If it is in the best in\u00ad terest and welfare of the child and public, an adjudication of wardship will be made. The next phase is the dispositional hearing, at which time the court may (1) order the appointment of a guardian for the child (2) allow the child to return to or remain in the parents' home ' under court supervision, or (3) emancipate the child pursuant to the Emancipation of Mature Minors Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 40, 2~01 et seq.). If court supervision is ordered, the case is con\u00ad ~1nue~ for progress.r7Ports to determine if the family is comply- 1ng w1th the superv1s1on order. If the family satisfactorily com\u00ad pletes the term 'of supervision, wardship' is vacated and the case is closed. If the supervision order is violated, the State can seek the appointment of a guardian for the child. Certain protective o:ders also can be entered by the court to supplement the disposi\u00ad t10nal o:der: protective orders usually require a parent to commit or refra1n from committing certain acts when a child is allowed to remain in or return to the parents' home. . Dispositional hearings are often deferred if the parents are engaged in family qounseling; if the court has ordered a psychia\u00ad tric eval~ation of the family members--performed by the Juvenile Court's Department of Clinical Services or a private psychiatrist or psychologist--the hearing will be deferred until the evaluations are completed. \" ,. At the dispositional hearing, the court must determine that disposition which b~st serves the interests of the minor and the public.: t,he standard of proof is a preponderance of the evidence, . and hearsay evidence is admissible. If the'parents are found to be unfit, unable or unwilling to care for the minor, a guardian can be appointed for the child. Such guardians can be either reliable, willing adult relatives or the Department of Children and Family Services, in which case the child will remain in a foster home. The case is continued for updated case. plans to the court every six months by the guardian on the status of the child. Only when the child r'eaches legal majority or is return.ed to the custody of his parents and court supervision is completed will the case bE! -115-i/ dismissed. During guardianship, parents retain certain rights and responsibilities such as visitation and supports. Termination of parental rights to free the child for adoption may be sought if the parents fail to exercise their rights and responsibilities with respect to the child. It is important to note that formal dispositional hearings are rendered unnecessary if all parties voluntarily agree upon a certain type of disposition for the child. Supplemental petitions to request a change in the status of a child (e.g., return of custody to parents, cha~qe of guardian, or termination of parental rights) or to seek the court's aid in ob\u00ad ~aining certain services for a child may be filed at any time dur\u00ad ~ng the pender1cy of a case. Most such petitions, however, are filed after a guardian has been appointed. If, after a guardian is appointed for the child, the parents do not make reasonable efforts or progress toward rehabilitation, or if the parents are unfit as defined in the Adoption Act (see Section C of this chapter), termination of parental rights may be request~d by either the Department of Children and'Family Services or a pr~vate agency. All parties must be served with notice of the filing of a petition to terminate parental rights. At the termination hearing, proof of parental unfitness must be clear and convincing evidence (see Section C of this Chapter). If the court finds the parents unfit, it then determines whether it is in the best interest of the child to appoint a guardian with the right to consent to adoption {which depends upon the likelihood of the child being adopted in the near future}. The child becomes fr(~e for ~doptionupon a finding of parental unfitness, termination of parental rights, and appointment of a guardian with the right to consent to adoption. F. Proposed and Enacted Revisions in Juvenile Court Law And Procedure Two bills, Senate Bills (SB) 605 and 1231, dealing with the Juvenile Court Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 37, 1r1r 701-1 to 708-4),' were introduced in the 82nd General Assembly and were given wide coverage. As originally introduced, both bills proposed the repeal of the Juvenile Court Act, SB 6'05 replacing the Act with a new \"Juvenile Code\" and SE 1231 replacing it witlJ, a 'new I1Code of Juvenile Law and Procedure.\" Actually, both bills contained major portions of the structure and wording found in the Juvenile Court Act but new sections were added and old sections reworded. The Chairman of a Senate subcmruni t\"t:ee' which ,held '. _ .. Subsequent to the preparation of prior sections of this chapter, an ame11deCl ve~siol1 of SB 1231 was signec1 into law 011 Septerilber a, 1982, as Publ~c Act (PA) 82-973. Consequently, a synopsis of this legislation is not contained in Section C of this chapter. Although the bill originally proposed a new Code, after study and public hearings, the Judiciary I~ Committee decided a complete revision -1'16-I I ( I [I l: \\ \" i r f~ f , ~ ,I t \"!' I I 1 ~ 4 ( 1 J ~ ~ J ~ t j I I 1 .~ I I i, , ~~--of the Juvenile Court Act was unnecessary and instead merely amended sections of the Act. We believe it likely that these or very similar bills will be introduced in future sessions of the General Assembly. Therefore, we will include here not only a discqssion of PA 82-973, but also a discussion of SB 605 and 1231 as originally introduced. Alt.hough these bills contained some provisions which do not relate specifi\u00ad cally to this report, we will discuss each of these bills in their entirety because both have far-reaching implications for Illinois juvenile court law and procedure. There are many differences between the two bills and between each bill and the Juvenile Court Act. Some of the differences are technical and others are significant, substantive changes. It would take many pages to summarize all of these differences. Instead, we will point out some of the major d~fferences bet~een each bill and the Juvenile Court Act. Inread~ng the compar~~ons, the reader should note the differences between the two bills ~n their treatment, of. confidentiality issues, trial of juveniles as adults, and the categories .of juveniles. 1. Senate Bill 1231 (Public Act 82-973) PA 82-973 adds a section to the Juvenile Court Act which expands the instances where a juvenile may be tried as an adult. A minor of at least 15 years of age who is charged with murder, rape, deviate sexual assault orarm~d robbery ~hen the armed rob\u00ad bery is committed with a firearm, w~ll automat~cally be transferred to criminal court. This act makes a number of changes regarding the confidenti\u00ad ality of records. Before revision, the Juvenile Court Act had a restrictive emphasis on. law enforcement and juvenile court records. PA 82-973 defines \"law enforcement records\" ahd \"juvenile court records\" and provides that inspection and copying of law enforce- ment records shall be restricted to: . 1) Any local, State or federal ,law enforcement officers of any jurisdiction or agency when. necessary for the discharge of their official duties during the investigation or prosecu\u00ad tion of a crime which would be a felony if coinmitted by an adult. 2) Prosecutors, probation officers, social workers, or other individuals assigned by the court to conduct a pre\u00ad adjudication or pre-disposition in)estigation, and individuals responsible for supervising or providing temporary or perma\u00ad nent care and custody for minors pursuant to the\"orger\u00b7of ~he .juvenile court, when e.ssential to performing the~r respons~\u00ad bilities. 3) '. Brosecutors and probation officers in the course of criminal proceedingf:) \"\" -117* 4) Adult and Juvenile Prisoner Review Board. 5) Authorized military personnel. 6) Persons engaged in bona fide research, with the permis\u00ad sion of the Presiding Judge of the Juvenile Court and the chief executive of the respective law enforcement agency. Inspection and copying of the juvenile court records shall be restricted to the following: 1) The child, his parents, guardian, and counsel. 2) Law enforcement officers and law enforcement agencies when such information is essential to executing an arrest or search warrant, or to conducting an ongoing investigation. 3) Judges, prosecutors, probation officers, social workers, or other individuals assigned by the court to conduct a pre\u00ad adjudication or pre-disposition investigation, and individuals responsible for supervising or providing temporary or perma\u00ad nent care and custody for minors pursuant to the order of the Juvenile Court. ~: .. 4) Judges, prosecutors, probation officers in the course of criminal proceedings. 5) Adult and Juvenile Prisoner Review Boards. 6) Authorized military personnel. 7) Victims, their subrogees and legal representatives; how\u00ad ever, those persons shall have access only 't.o \"the name and address of the minor and the disposition of the Juvenile Court proceeding. . 8) Persons engaged in bona fide research, with the permis\u00ad sion of the Presiding Judge of the Juvenile Court and the chief executive of the agency that prepared the particular records. \" Admissability of evidence in other proceedings is also dif\u00ad ferent from the pre-amendment Act which placed strict limits on admissability. PA 82-973 permits admission of evidence given in juvenile court proceedings: 1) in subsequent proceedings under the Juvenile Court Act concerning the same minor; or 2) in criminal proceedings when the court is to determine the amount of bail, fitness or the defendant or in sentencing under the Unified Code of CorreCtions; or 3) in 'proceedings under the Act or in criminal proceec;lings II -118-in ~hich anyone who has been adjudicated delinquent is to be a w~tness, and then only for purposes of impeachment and pur\u00ad suant to the rules of evidence for criminal trials; or 4) in civil proceedings concerning causes of action arising out of the incident or incidents which initially gave rise to the proceedings under the Act. PA 82-973 provides for expunging law enforcement and juvenile :ourt,records wh7n the child has reached age 17 or when all Juven~le proceed~ngs against the child have terminated whichever is later, upon petition by the child in the following ~ircumstances: 1) the minor was arrested and no petition for delinquency was filed with the clerk of the circuit court; or 2) the minor was charged with an offense and was found not delinquent of that offense; or 3) t~e minor was placed under supervision pursuant to the Juven~le Court Act and such order of supervision has since been successfully terminated. Law enforcement records relating to incidents occurring before a pe~son's 17th birthday which did not result in criminal proceedings ~nd juvenile court records relating to any crimes, except murd7r, ,committed before a,person's 17th birthday, if he h~s no conv~ct~ons for any crime since h,is 17th birthday and e~ther 10 years have passed since his 17th birthday or 10 years have passed since all juvenile court proceedings against him have terminated, whichever is later, may be expunged. In addition to prohibiting a minor under 16 years of age from being confined in a jailor place ordinarily used for confinement of , prisoners in a po~ice station, PA 82-973 also provides that ch~ldren under 17 must be kept separate from confined adults and may not at any time be kept in the same cell, room or yard with adults confined pursuant to the criminal law. Regarding summons to appear in cOllrt, the act adds the provision that: When a parent or other person who signed a written promise to .appear and bring the minor to court or who has waived or acknowledged service, fails to appear with the minor on the date set by the court, a bench warrant may be issued for the parent or otber person, \"the minor, or both. . The pre:-amendment Juvenile Court Act contained a provision for ~he,cont~nuanc7 o~ a <?ase under superv~sion before proceeding to or hear~ng evidence but before mak~ng a f~nd1ng.' PA 82-973 expands on this provision by providing the following: -119-l' 1) A minor otherwise in need of supervision, a neglecte~ or abused minor, or a dependent minor whose case has.be~n d~n\u00ad tinued under supervision may be permitted to remaJ.n ~n hJ.s home~ 2) The period of continuance under supervision for a delin\u00ad quent minor may not exceed 24 months. 3) When the hearing of a delinquent minor is continued under supervision, the court may' requir~ the minor to do any of the following: a) not violate any criminal statute of any jurisdiction; b) make a report to and appear in person b~~fore any person or agency as di'rected by the court; c) work or pursue a course of study or vocational training; d) undergo medical or psychotherapeutic ~rec:tment rendered by a therapist, or treatment for drug ,addJ.ctJ.on or alcoholism; e) attend or reside in a facility established for the instruc,tion or residence ,of persons on prob~tion; f) support his dependents, if any; g) pay costs; h) refrain from possessing a firearm or other dangerous weapon, or an automobile; i) permit the probation officer to visit him at his home or elsewhere; j) :reside with his parents or in a foster home; k) iattend school; 1) attend a non-residential program for youthi m); contribute .to his own support at home or in a foster ho',tue; n} perform some reasonable public service work; 6,,) make restitution to the victim; '''\"-,'I '?,iF?) comply with curfew req:uirements as designated by the Ipourts ; or ;q) comply wi th any other conditions as may be ordered. by .! the cQur,t. II -120-I , The proposed SB, 1231 added a section requiring that in the following cases ~he juvenile be. tried as an adult: 1. persons 14 or older who allegedly commit murder, rape, deviate sexual assault, heinous battery, home invasion, aggravated arson, or armed robbery in which a firearm is used; 2. p~rsons 14 or older who allegedly commit any crime of violence classified as a Class 1 felony and who at the time of the alleged commission of such class 1 felony have twice been adjudicated delinquent for crimes which would be class 1 felonies if ~ommitted by adults; or . 3. persons 14 or older who allegedly commit any crime which would be a \u00a3elony if qommitted by an adult where the child 'previously had been charged with a crime which would be a felony if'cominitted by an adult and these earlier proceedings resulted iri'waiver of jurisdiction by the juvenile court. The definition of minor in need of supervision (MINS) as appearing in the Juvenile Court Act has changed to child in need of supervision (CINS) and was defined as any child under 18 who: 1. demonstrates disregard for or misuse of lawful parental authority of the child's legal guardian or custodian; 2. violates the compulsory education laws of the state of Iilinois; 3. absents himself without. p~rmission of his parent or legal guardian or legai Gustodi::1'<1from h:i,s approved place of residence; 4. demonstrates dysfunctional behavior as a result of excessive use of alcoholic beverages o~ drugs. This definition is bro'ader than that in the Juvenile Court Act because of the addition of alcohol abuse and runaways. SB 1231 enacted as PA 82-973 contains prov~sions for continuance of a hearing under supervision. A similar procedure was contained in proposed SB 1231 but was called Iladjournment in contemplation of dismissal.\" Unlike the pre-am~ndment Juvenile Court Act and the enacted SB 1231, its use was limit'edto CINS and neglect cases. The purpose is\" \"an adjournment of tl'le proceeding for a period not to exceed 1 year with a view to ultimate dismissal of the petition in the ;turtherance of j l.lst:ice. \" , The court may order various terms and conditions during this period but must include that the child be in the respondent's 1/ custody, and that the child and the respondent be under thesuper~ vision of a child protection 'agency or other appropriate child ~; welfare agenoy. If the agency fails substantially t,o provide the respondent: 'with, adequate supervision or to observe ,the terms and cQnditions of the order, the court may direct them 'to do so. -121-,; /. ::\" ;1 ~--- -~---- ------------------------------.-~------------~~------~------------------------------------~------------------- --..... -... ~.~--\"-. If the court determines that the respondent has failed to substantially observe the terms and conditions ox to cooperate wit~ ~he supervis~n~ agency and that the facts alleged in the pet~t~on are suff~7~ent,t~ establish CINS or neglect, the court may proceed to a d~spos~t~on hearing a.nd enter'an order of dis\u00ad posi~ion with the same force and effect as if an adjudicatory hear~ng had been held. In addition to waiving any applicable communications privi\u00ad lege between any professional person and his patient or client except the attorney/client privileg(a, as is provided in the cu;\u00ad re~t: ,law, SB 1231 woul,d also waive the husband/wife pr~v~lege. . Similar to the current law which provides that the court may make an order of protection, this bill would add that when the . order of,p:otection i~ mad7 act~veparticipation in the rehabili\u00ad tat~on process and may impose specific requirements on him subject to penalty for contempt. The proposed SB 1231 adds a provision for orders in addition to or in lieu of placement which may: , 1. direct a child protective agency, or other duly autilor- ~zed agency to undertake dilig,ent efforts to encourage and strengthen the parental relationship when it finds such efforts will not be detrimental to the best interests of the child. Such . order may include a specific plan of action for such agency or official including, but not limited to, requirements that such agency or official assist the parent or other person responsible for the child's care in obta.ining adequate housing, employment, counseling, medical care or psychiatric treatment; and 2. direct a duly authorized agency to cooperate with the Staters Attorneys Office to institute proceedings to legally free the child for adoption, and upon a failure .by such official or\" a~en~yto comply within 30 days after entry of such order, per\u00ad ~tt~ng the foster parent(s) in whose home the child resides to institute such an act;ion with the State's Attorney. PrOposed SB 1231 added the requireme~t that if a law\u00b7 enforcemen'l: officer takes a chi~d who is alleged to be abused or neglected into temporary custody, ~.~th or without a warrant, he\" shall ,1. notify the Illinois\u00b7\"Department of Children and Family Serv~ces that he has taken protective custody of the child; and 2. bring the child to a place designated by the Department ~f Children and Family Servic9Sj for his p~pose,'unless the child ~s pr will be presently admitted to ahospita1. (\\ ., . A'provision of this nature does not enacted SB 1231. -122-~ I\u00b7 ~ , , l ~ r ~ .. ' i r' I , i \" f\" j :~ ~ I:~ th.e pJ:;'ohibition that a minor under 16 cannot he confined in a jailor place ordinarily used ;for con\u00ad finememt of prisoners in a police station and instead provided that children under 17 must be kept separate from confined adults and may not at any time be kept: in the same cell, room or yard with adults confined pursuant to the criminal law. Enacted SB 1231 contains both provisions. Proposed SB 1231 also provided a list of circumstances when a juvenile detention may be used, such as: 1. upon taking a child into custody for alleged conduct which if committed by an adult would constitute a crime; 2. while awaiting extradition as a runaway, escapee or absconder, pursuant to the Interstate Compact on Juveniles without the necessity of prior approval of the court. Similarly, juvenile secure shelter facilities may be used without prior approval of the court for 1. children from this state who have runaway from their approved place or residence; or 2. children who are del~nquent, or who are otherwise in need of supervision. The enacted SB 1231 contains,. no similar provision. Portions of the proposed SB 1231 which did not appear in the enacted PA 8~-973, were contained in SB '623 which was signed into law on September 8, 1982 as PA 82-969. For example, \"minor in need o.f supervision, II as provided in the Juvenile Court Act, has been changed in PA 82-969 to \"minor requiring authoritative or habitual truant, \"is absent from home without consent of parent, guardian or custodian, or is beyond the control of his or her parent, guardian or custodian. Proposed SB 1231 provided- for . .changing \"minor in to \"child in need of super\u00ad vision\" and defined the new term in substantially the same manner in which \"minor requiring authoritative intervention\" is defined. 2. Senate Bill 605 The Juvenile court Act classifies juveniles under its juris\u00ad diction into four categories: delinquent, minor in need of super\u00ad vision (MINS), abused or neglected, or dependent. SB 605 provides for only two categories. It re.tains the delinquent category, but eliminates the other three: These are repl,aced with a c1ass'ifioa\u00adtion .designated n:f;amily in need of supervision\" (FINS). FINS is defined as: a family with a minor: a) who is beyond the control of his or her parents, guardian 6r custodian; -123-b) who has committed a private offense or whO,se behavior is injurious to his or her own welfare; c) who has not received proper or necessary support, or medical, remedial or other care necessary for his or her well being, or whose environment is injUrious to the minor's welfare; d) who is abu.sed; e) who is without parent, guardian or custodian by reason of death, abandonment, or physical or mental disability 'of the minor's parent, guardian or custodian; or, f) whose parenitl? fail to provide education as required by law; except that no 'minor or family shall be included herein solely for the purpq!se of qualifying for financial assistance. The case disposi:i:ion choices available\" to the court for a FINS case are similar ,to those found in the Juvenile Court Act with two major changes. SB 6615 provides that an order of disposition may require any of the p1rties respond~nt (parents, guardians) to: i) att:.en& and participate in counseling, whether public, Ii ' private or throug~ probat10n; ii) cooplrate with any agency; , If iii) partttciPate ili visitation with\"'the child, whether in or out of the home; , iv) ~arjficiPC\\te iil any court ordered or agency II \"\" ,:i '. v) proyide transpo;-tation to school\", medical care for the child or any othiar court ordered program; II I: ::;\"11 ' II \", jl I' vi) in psychiatric or mental treatment; vii) do jl'any 'other reasonable acts \u00a3ortlie rehabilitation of ' I' i the family. I, ;l \" # In add;i.. tion, I!the court may order the Department of' Childre~t and Family ServicE!s, Department of Mental Health and DevelopmenJ:;al Disabilities, Illj;nois Conunission on Delinquency Prevent:i,.on or any local probation adJency to provide services to the minor or his family even thougi,l. they had not been made the guardian or custodian of the minor. I ' SB 605 proviaes a. penalty clause for violation of itjs confi\u00ad dentiality ofrec6rds provisions. A violation is a The agsrieved juvenile Illay sue and punitive dama!~es, including attorney's fees\" and the '1'Tiolator may not a any inununi ty, ei theJ:' qu'alifiecl or absolute. Neith~lr enacted SB 1231 jontain provisi9n. ! l ,~ 'r !: Ii ;,'1 ,I ,', The Juvenile Court Act provides that a law enforcement officer may take a minor into custody without a warrant and if not released, the minor shall be taken before the court or to a place of reception for minors designated by the court. SB 605 ex~and~ upon this , section by including specific procedures. Under th~s b~ll the off~cer shall have the following options: The 1. \"make informal:1street adjustment and release; 2. make informal street adjustment with release to the parents; or 3. notif\u00a5 the parents and take the minor to a youth officer. youth officer may take one of the ~lllow.Lng actions: 1. station adjustment with reled's: '\" ,//; 2. stat10n adJustment w1tb7release of the minor to a parent; 3 t t' d' l , s a 10n a Jus~ent, r~lease of the m1nor to a parent, referral of the case to co~~unity services; , and 4. station adjustment, release of the minor to a paren~, referral of\u00b0the case to community services with informal mo~itoring by youth officer; 5. station adjustment and release of the minor to a third person pursuant to agreement of the minor and parents; 6. station adjustment, release of the minor to a third person pursuant to agreement of the minor and parents, and referral of the case to co~unity services; 7. station adjustment, release of the minor to a third person pursuant to agreement of the minor and parent, and referral to community services with informal monitoring by a youth officer; 8. release of the minor to his parents ,and referral to a juvenile probation officer; (; 9. taking the minor to court or place of reception designated for minors; or 10. any other appropriate action with consent of the minor and parent. In a further attempt to divert a minor from the formal court process, this hill expands upon the Juvenile Court Act which allows theojuvenile proBation officer to conduct a preliminary conference with the person seeking to file a petition, the prospective II respondents and other intere~ted persons. Efforts to adjust suit\u00ad able cases without the filing of, a petition may not extend beyond -125-~ __ (1 <r three months. SB 605 provides a list of ~non-judicial social adjustment plans\" which the juvenile probation officer may\"make, including: 1. informal 6-mo~th supervision within i:he family; 2. informal 6-month supervision with a probation officer involved; 3. informal 6-month supervision with release to a person other than parent; 4. refe~~l to special education, counseling or other -rehabilitat~ie social or educational program; and 5. referral\" t&' residential treatment program. SB 605 failed to pass out of the Senate. t( \\.) \\) -126-() I (\\ . Chapt.er 4 CASE STUDIES: CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT Commission investigators reviewed dozens of case files in order to find cases that were representative of the types of cases dealt with by DCFS. We were not looking for cases thi;lt had been handled perfectly; nor were we looking for sensationaiized cases that had been mishandled by everyone in the child protective net\u00ad work. Rather, we wanted to look at cases that seemed to reflect the typical problems that one might encounter in any review of child abuse and neglect cases. Each case is unique; each case has variables as individualistic as the vic~irn, the par~nts, and the workers involved. But we looked for cases in which we could identify actions that were appropriate or inappropriate for the individual case. We looked for cases that reflected some of the problems we had discovered i~1 our review of the child abuse litera'\" ture. We looked for cases ir~ which there had been extraordinary inter-agency cooperation, or 'the lack thereof. Finally, because we were specifically mandated by House Resolution 776 to do so, we did .look for cases that might hacve been mismanaged by DCFS workers at one level or another. But we did not limit our search to those types of cases. While our case search was not totally random or\" scientific, it also was not based on preformulated opin\u00ad ion or suspicion. A. Walter. On F,ebruary ~O, 1980, a young boy named Walter was abused by his mother's boyfriend. Allegedly, the boyfriend immersed Walter'p hands. into hot water, resulting in second and third de\u00ad gree burns. The boy's mother apparently was not home at the time and a babysitter claimed to know nothing of the incident. The boyfriend took Walter to Mt. Sinai Hospital in Chicago for treatment of the burns; Mt. Sinai officials contacted both the police and DCFS. Our investigators spoke with a Mt. Sinai social worker who handled Walter's case. He mentioned that the hospital has a Ghild Protective Team to deal with abuse cases. Because Walter was at Mt. Sinai from February 10 to March 13, his case would have been discussed by the team several times. The team viewed the case ., as quite serious. The team was not sO much bothered by the in\u00adjuries as by the atmosphere. and conditions of the home. Although ,the boyfriend never admitted to the abuse, the team felt it \u00b7was obvious that it had occurred. The'team received information about the home from DCFS work\u00aders and visiting nurses. They said that the mother appeared to , be alcoholic; other children in the home appeared to~be malnourished. The team decided tha't Walter should not be returned home unless -127-c' the boyfriend were removed from the home. Ultimately, he did leave the home immediately prior to Walter's hospital release. After Walter's release, he was supposed to visit the hospi\u00adtal five times a week for rehabilitation as a result of the burns. Failure to do so'would have resulted in some loss of the use of his hands. Initially, the mother was unable to make the appoint\u00ad ments, or did not understand their importance~ Finally, she agreed to bring Walter in three times a week. Chicago Pol:j,ce Department records reflect that a DCFS CPS worker was called to the hospital, as were the police, on Febru\u00ad ary 10. The CPS worker assumed temporary custody of Walter, and such custody remained in effect until the boy's release from the hospital. The boyfriend was arrested on February 11 and charged with battery. At the preliminary hearing, Judge John P. McGury, on the motion of the State's Attorney, ordered the Cqse stricken on leave to reinstate, apparently because there was neither a con\u00ad fession nor any witness to the crime. Commission staff also spoke with the CPS worker who had handled the case. She knew little about the case because she had only been active on it for a short period of time. She had contracted with Central Baptist Family Services for counseling. We also spoke with the liaison .. worker with DCFS who handled cases referred to Central Baptist Family Services. When we spoke with her in August of 1981, she was unaware of the status of the case. We subsequently learned that the case was closed on November 18, 1981. I, ,; We asked the liaison worker if the mother had to cooperate with the contractual agency; she said that the mother did have to cooperate or the case would be brought back before the court. The liaison worker's only other comment was that the six-month time limit that contractual agencies had to work with a family was too brief. . I\u00b7 We spoke with the social worker with Central Baptist Family Services who had been the direct service worker for Walter when the case was first referred. She worked through a program called Emergency Caretaker and Homemaker Outreach (ECHO)'. The ECHO pro\u00ad gram deals only with cases of abuse and neglect and does not pro\u00ad vide counseling or any other services in their offices; rather, all treatment is rendered in the home. When we spoke with the worker in May, 1981, she still was visiting the home weekly. How\u00ad ever, she felt the case could be closed by ECHO soon thereafter. She mentioned that official court involvement'had ceased on Novem\u00ad ber 2, 1980, when t.he neglect case had been dismissed . After '''that time, the mother accepted services voluntarily. -128-'-' 1 ,\u00b71,' , \" . , ':he ECHO worker agreed that the nature of the burns that Walte-r susta1ned suggested deliberate abuse. One of the reasons her agency had ~emained activ~ with the case was to assure that Walter would ~ece1ve pr~p~r med1cal attention. She also mentioned the malnour-7shed,cond1t10n of the other children as a reason to continue work-1ng w1th the mother. . , The ECHO wo~ker told,us services had been pro\u00ad v1~ed to the fam11y: fam1ly therapy, parenting, home management sk1lls, transportat10n for Walter to the hospital nutritional education, and provision for both a homemaker and' visiting nurse. The w~rker reported no contact between the mother and her former boyfr1end. She felt that the incident had been a single, isolated case o~ abus~. She~a~so felt that the mother had improved in her p~rent1ng sk1lls ana 1n the general supervision of her children. F1nally, the worker said that one must appreciate the problems fa<?ing the mother: she was only 23 years old and already had six ch1ldren to care for. She felt the stress level in the home must have been high, and the boyfriend's presence was the reason abuse had occurred. Our,case analysis indicates that the mother was provided use\u00ad ful, serV1ces that should stand her in good stead. Treatment was adequate and the case was directed through proper channels until its resolution. Finally, our analysis of DCFS and ECHO documents shows that ~evera~ si~nificant documents were missing from the DCFS file, 1ncludHig 1ntake sheets and quarterly progress reports from ECHO to DCFS. Workers were unable to explain their loss. B. Marie on,May 9~ 1979, 15-year-old Marie, a junior in high school, had a f1ght w1th her mother. Her mother had refused to allow Marie to visit her boyfriend. Marie's mother is divorced and has a history of mental illness and alcoholism. \" . , The next day Marie arrived at school with minor cuts on her wr1s~s. When taken to the school social worker, Marie threatened to k1ll herself. The social worker called the girl's mother who the~ ~ame to the school with her own boyfriend and her \u00b7attor~ey. Mar1e s mother sh~wed no sympathy for the girl's problem; she re\u00ad fused to do anyth1ng except take Marie home and punish her . The school social worker did not want to leave the matter there. She aSked,the,vicep{inCipal and the principal for f-ldvice, then called the H1lls1de polLce and DCFS. The social worker want\u00ad ed to have Marie hospitalized because of her suicide threats. The pol~ce,ag~e~d. The DCFS worker; however, thOUght that this was an 1ns1gn1f1cant 9ase and advised that Marie be turned \"over to her mother. After several hours of haggling with the case\u00ad worker and ~CFS lawyers (on the phone), both the school personnel and .. the po11ce. thought the caseworker's attitude irresponsible -129- . . ~--------------.------------------~--------~--~----------------~-----------~ and decided to handle the situation themselves. The police took Marie to {1niversity of Illinois Hospital for observation, where she remained for a brief period of psychiatric counseling. On May 15, Marie was released from the hospital and was taken by a DCFS caseworker to a foster care facility for adolescent girls, the Living Center for Girls, on west Washington Street in Chicago, operated by the Volunteers of America. She continued to go to her high school in the suburbs. About a month later, Marie ran away from the Living Center for Girls. The administration of the Center did not call the po\u00ad lice, and for two or three days no one there k~ew what had hap\u00ad pened to her. Finally, the Volunteers of Amerlca cal17d DCFS and learned that Marie had returned home and become reconclled to her mother. Shortly thereafter, Marie married and left the state. After June 15, 1979, DCFS had no further contact with Marie, and closed~the case on April 16, 1981. We interviewed several of the?~ersons involved in Marie's case. The school personnel felt that DCFS had not handled the case properly. When the mother, the apparent cause of Marie's distress arrived at the school and insisted on taking the girl home to be punished, the DCFS caseworker sided with the mother. The police and the school personnel then had to take Marie to the hospital themselves. Afterward, neither the police nor ~he ~chool workers were informed of Marie's discharge from the hospltal or her placement at the Living Center for Girls. The relationship between DCFS and the police is typically very poor; in this case it was no di~fe~ent., The,police Unlverslty of IlllnOls Hospital. Afterwards, the youth officer involved in the case was'. never informed of Marie's prQglress; 'he had to make several phone \" calls himself to find out whci'f had happened. He told us that he ' was upset with th.e placement of a white suburban girl in a home in the heart of a black urban ghetto. He felt a placement in a more familiar area, nearer to her high school, w0tl.ld have been more sensible. .f We would not call Marie's group home placement \"inappropriate,\" but neither would we call it ideal. Frances Barnes, Director of the Living Center for Girls, told us that she had no specific ter\u00ad mination date for Marie's stay there because the girl had run away sometime in the second week in June. She said that it was not at all unusual for girls to run away from the home, so the Center hadn't called the police, only DCFS. As to the appropriateness of placing Marie in the home, Barnes said that the majority of the residents are black but tl1at race poses no problem. She described 'the facility as a sort of \"United Nations.\" Barnes also said that they haVe had no problems based on location. The DCFS'file on this case is short\u00b7 and concise. Marie's\" case is not .. aclassic example of abuf?e or neglect, but it suggests the kind of amorphous case with which DCFS workers, and others, -130-,. J must sometimes deal. It illustrates some of the shortcomings of the Department, particularly in the area of limited resources. T~e DCFS caseworker who responded to the call of the school so\u00ad clal worker saw the sj,tuation as mild and easily resolved; in con\u00ad trast to many of the cases DCFS it was. However Marie w'7's ;:hreatening suicide; her wrist t~ounds ~n~ention was necessarily superficial. Her place\u00ad mentln an unfamlll.ar,and potentially hostile part of the city ~em~mstrates not negllgence but lack of resources. Luckilyv and ln large part owing to the efforts of the police a.nd the school personnel, Marie's case ended well. C. Jody and Susan Commission staff pieced together the details of an abuse case within a single family that involved two sisters, Jody and Susan. '~he case is interesting for\u00b7 several reasons, not the least of which lS the pattern of continued abuse by the mother. Interviewees -' told us that the abuse of one of the girls first surfaced in 1972. Records we examined also indicated that a child abuse report was made on February 28, 1972, but we found no copy of that in~tial report. The report had been made to Child and Family Advocates of Evanston (CAFA). Notes in the file state that the records were sent to the Evanston Hospital Administrator but never were returned. Commission staff spoke with the Director of Social Services at Evanston Hospital regarding the case. She told us that she was fairly certain that a report of abuse of Jody had been made in 19?2, but she had been unable to locate the file. She was not surprlsed that the report had been lost because reporting of abuse in 1972 was rather unsophisticated and informal. .1 The next contact we noted occurred when Jody was three years old. Evanston Hospital records indicate that she was admitted on March 18,' 1973. Jody was treated for a severe burn on one foot. The report raises the possibility that the injury had been caused by abuse, but the incident never was reported to DCFS. However, the mother and Jody were involved for five months in counseling with th7 Family Counseling Service of Evanston and Skoki~ Valley. C~unsellng ,ended when the mother sent the child to J;amaica t.o stay wlth relatlves. \"Staff at that time felt that some progress had been made with the mother. At th~ time that Jody was sent back to Jamaica, her sister Susan already lived there with relatives. Both of the girls' par\u00ad ents were Jamaican natives. The cultural differences between Jamaica and this country were to beco~e a soignificant issue in this case. Our review\"of other documentation indicates that when Jody was admitted to the hospital in 1973, she had severe burns, and other marks and bruises. The mother claimed that 'her babysitter had beaten Jody and that Jody had been burned by pulling a kettle of hot water over onto;herself. These documents indicate that counseling was\" weekly until Jody ~laS returned to Jamaica for al\u00admost two years. -131-fit 4; ; 4Q22 l' l \\ \". ~. The next report of abus e came in November, 1 975. 'rhe DCFS Central Register indicates that this report was investigated by CAFA (at that time, even abuse investigatio~ were contracted out to pr.ivate agencies in some cases). We determined that on November 24, 1975 a school community aide for a public elementary school in Evanston brought Jody to the school principal; Jody had marks on her back, a bruised lip, and an infection in one ear. When the aide had questioned Jody about the marks on her back, she had responded that she had been whipped. JodyRs mother was called in by the principal the following day, at which time she was told that a referral would be made to CAFA. CAFA case notes state that a horne visit occurred the follow\u00ad ing day. Jody's mother told CAFA workers during the visit that the child did not act properly. The mother admitted she left Jody home alone because she could not trust babysittersi her lack of trust stemmed from an allegation of infidelity between her hus\u00ad band and one of the babysitters. The mother did not perceive her other child in the home, Karl, to be a behavior problem; Jody, though, presented a problem. To keep her in line, the mother \\vhipped her. .- These case notes state that an examination of Jody showed \"01d whip lash scars and welts across back and buttocks. II The mother showed the CAFA workers the leather strap she used to disci\u00ad pline Jody. When a CAFA worker asked if her relatives in Jamaica had whipped Jody, the mother said they had. Karl, just two years old at the time, was described as very hyperactive and aggressive. The worker questioned the mother concerning some of his behavior (spittng, talking back to the mother), but the mother defended him and made it clear he never had been abused. The CAFA assessment was that the mothe.r was totally overwhelmed by her life. She was pregnant but still working and had very lit\u00ad tle time t.o herself. Her own mother had rai,sed eleven children, and her upbringing had been very strict. A CAFA document dated December 1, 1975, inqludes additional information about the initial incident and the f.amily. One com- ment is: \"Mrs. sees her problems stEimming primarily from Jody's attitUde and behavior. The mother is a severely stressed woman who cannot adequately cope \" The notes included with this document indicate that the mother criticized Jody for lying and for \"attempting to break Up\" the mother's marriage. The document states that the mother would be referred forcoun\u00ad seling to the St. Francis Hospital Adult and Child Guidance Cen\u00ad ter; DCFS would be notified by mail; and the principal who had brought this case to light would be kept up' to date regarding de\u00ad velopments in the case. Just as DCFS contracts out for most direct services, so did\")) CAFA at that time ~ontract with private agencies to provide treat\u00ad ment. CAFA case notes, as a result, are sparse. Several docu\u00ad ments from 1976 repep.t what we have already learned. The .,most -132 .... I useful piece of information is a notation of another allegation of abuse. Supposedly, Jody was again abused on April 21, 1976, and taken to Evanston Hospital for treatment. Apparently the in\u00ad cident was reported; it was given a DCFS reporting number. How\u00ad ever, no disposition of the case is reported, nor did we discover other references to the incident. By April of 1976, Jody's mother had given birth to another child, Diana. At about the same time that t.he above abuse inci\u00ad dent supposedly occurred, Jody was sent to Jamaica again. At this time, the mother was supposed to be in counseling at St. Francis Adult and Child Guidance Center, but because Jody was returned to Jamaica, counseling ceased, even though there were two other children in the home (Karl and Diana). The Director of Social Services of Evanston Hospital told us that one of the problems with the c&se was that only the mother was involved in counseling. She felt that Jody should have been in therapy together with her mother. Jody did cause some of her own problems, she thought, and they might have been avoided in the future had she received counseling also. Jody next came to the attention of school authorities on the morning of October 21, 1976. A social worker for her elementary school examined her after she came to class with bruises on her arms. School personnel decided to check further and discovered bruises and welts over her entire body. The social worker told one of our investigators that she never will forget hav{hg to soak Jody's legs in water in order to get her tights off, due to the amount of dried blood that was causing them to stick. I, The girl was taken to Evanston Hospital and CAFA was called in to perform another investigation. The social worker told us that ordinarily she was very pleased with CAFA investigations; in Jody's case, though, she felt that CAFA had done an inadequate job, as had St. Francis Adult and Child Guidance Center. She told us that the treating psychologist at St. Francis refused to fur\u00ad nish school authorities with any records pertaining to Jody after October, 1976, citing his privilege of confidentiality. The so\u00ad cial worker felt that ~e had been manipulated by the mother, just as she had tried to manipulate others involved in her daughter's care. This CAFA investigation revealed both new and old whip marks on Jody. When CAFA workers interviewed the girl, she said that she had made her mother angry, and her mother had hit her with an ironing cord. She did not know what she had d,one to make her mother so angry. When CAFA workers confronted the mother with the facts of the abuse, she said that a babysitter had told her that Jody had picked up her younger sister while standing near a window; the babysitter had been afraid that Jody was going to throw the. baby outside. When she told the mother what had happened, the mother whipped Jody with an ironing cord. -133- /} CAFA held a staffing the following day with most of those involved at one time or another with the family. One of the work\u00ad e~s ;saiCi that the mother' ~ attitude toward Jody was overly pun.i\u00ad t1ve; she mentioned that the mother had once told her that Jody was \"evil.\" This worker expressed concern about Jody's remaining in i:he home. From November, 1975, to May, 1976, a psychologist worked with the! mother on a weekly basis. Occasional homemaker services were provided. The father refused to participate in counseling of any kind. CAFA terminated the case in 1976 with the following nota\u00ad tion: Dr. felt that at the time of termination some stresses had been reduced and there had been some improvement in child management and \"moderate relief of personal upsets.\" He recom\u00ad mended that therapeutic treatment with the family be continued when the family was more receptive to it. The termination report also states that Jody is a scapegoat for chronic abuse and that such abuse stops when treatment services are provided, only to begin again when those services are with\u00ad drawn. Recommendations were that Jody be placed in a protective env.ironment, that the parents undergo psychiatric evaluation and counseling, and that the condition of the two younger children be monitored to be certain they were not being abused. A psychiatric evaluation dated March 14, 1977, states that the mother sees her children as \"miniature adults\" and could not develop a proper attitude toward the children. His recommenda~ tion was that Jody remain out of the horne and that additional psy\u00ad chiatric evaluations of the mother be made. Subsequently, Jody was placed in foster care for about fif\u00ad teen months, returning home in March, 1976. A doctor who had worked witR-the family previously recommended that Jody be returned home with s:,\\:rict supervision; instead, she was placed in foster care. t fl' I \" \\ Meanwhile, Jody's mother was referred td'Associates in Crisis Therapy, Inc. (ACT). ACT therapists were to develop an assessment of the mother's capacity \"to parent\" Jody, \\>lere to determine the child's therapy needs, and were to develop a counseling relation\u00ad ship with the entire family. Involvement with the family began in July, 1977. One of the early notations in the case file is that counseling sessions were interrupted in the summer of 1977 by the mother's return to Jamaica. The mother returned to arrange for her daughter by a previous marriage, Susan, to corne to the states to live. The following description of the family is valu\u00ad able to a full view of the home situation: Their participation is more passive than active not solely from resistance. ~hey are both natives of rural Jamaica. .Their culture, religion, and education n~s not prepared them to con- -134-r ceptualize in ways familiar to native urban middle class white Evanstonians. They are not good candidates for insight based psychotherapy. For them, the request by a stranger for per- . sonal information is rudeness. Our culture has allowed psy-. chotherapists the permission to violate such social norms and ask questions about \"personal business\". In Jamaica such pri\u00ad vilege is limited to the family. The judge can grant a psycho\u00ad therapist the authority to ask, but he cannot convince the [parents] of how giving the answers will help them live their l~ves better. They have no model for that type of thinking. [The mother] had great difficulty accepting the notion of am\u00ad bivalence and seemed perplexed by the idea of unconscious moti\u00ad vation. She feels what she feels. $he does not feel anything she is not aware of feeling. The assessment also mentions that Jody was not suffering from any emotional illness or psychotic reaction to her abusive home. She did not understand why she had been taken from her horne or what she had to do to go back. She clearly wanted to return home. The official assessment was that she viewed foster care as \"exile.\" Further, the assessment determined that it was likely that Jody had only been abused twice, and characterized the abuse as epi\u00ad sodic rather than chronic. The assessment also recommended that the mother and daughter attend joint counseling sessions and that the two should begin unsupervised weekly half-day visits, over\u00ad night visits a month later, and weekend visits two months later. Meanwhile, Susan came to this country. Evanston police De\u00ad partment records indicate that she first came to their attention in July, 1978. A police officer picked her up following a ~un- away and, because he noticed bruises, took her to St. FrancH; Hos\u00adpital for x-rays and other tests. The off icer called~\\ DCFS; a worker removed her ,from the hospital, placed her in emergency care for a few days, and then returned her home. Shortly before this incident, Jody was found to have been abused while in her foster horne and was returned to the natural home.~hortly after her return, a,buse of Jody began again. \" Sc~ool officials wrote letters to DCFS after Jody appeared at school w1th a ,:;t:;trge bump on her forehead. Jodyalso told school offi~ials I that her sister Susan often was Tilhipped for doing \"bad th1ngs. I Another letter was sent to DCFS three weeks later, after Jody came to school with\" burn marks next to her eye and on her ear. Jody told school staff that her mather twice had burned her accidentally while curling her hair. Fina.lly, a letter to DCFS mentions that Jody stopped attending SUITaner s.chool after Susan's abuse became a matter of police record. An ACT therapi.st submitted a progress report dated July 25, 1978, that discusses the entire family's therapy. The report states that ACT had been instrumental in persuading DCFS workers to re- ':turn Susan to her home following an allegation of abuse made by an attending dOCtOD at St. Francis Hospital$ He says that \" our agency took the position that Susan and Jody were b~st treated in the context of their family.\" -135- This assessment adds a number of recommendations for continued supervision of the children. Recommended were cor.'tinued evaluations for Susan; a clear statement of responsibility from the Juvenile Court judge assigned; presentation of the DCFS,case plan in open court; allowing the parents to press a complaint. against the abusive foster mother; the possibility of the mother taking a leave of absence from work; consequences for the parents\u00b7 being spelled out clearly if abuse were to continue; and being certain that pertinent ACT records were taken to court by DCFS workers at the next hear\u00ad ing. ACT referred the family to Developmental Abilities Service (DAS) of Lutheran General Hospital in late July, 1978. DAS case summaries refer repeatedly to Jody's \"history\" of stealing and lying, mentioning at one point that her foster mother had abused her because of her stealing. These documents also are interest\u00ad ing because they present the first evidence that the mother had been abused as a child--not by her mother, but by her sisters. She transplanted this learned behavior to the United States and to her own children~ Although ACT had referred the case to DAS, it remained active with the family in counseling. One ACT document recommends that the DCFS caseworker remain mindful of past manipulative behavior by the parents; that the family should continue to be viewed as high risk, with the family being adept at denial and proj~ction of blame\u00b7 that efforts continue to be made to assess Susan's needs accurateiy; that the only male child in. the family also be moni\u00ad tored for possible abuse\u00b7 and, finally but most importantly, that the caseworker should be'prepared to remove all of the children from the home should another incident occur, 'WIth thf= realizat~on that such abuse is representative of a pattern of abuse and not'\" just another isolated incident. The . d~)ct;tment als,? ut~l~z~ng Cr~m~nal Court to establish the father'S culpability for failing to pro\u00ad tect his children and the mother'S inability to learn new \"coping behaviors\" regardless of the number of opportunities with which she had been presented. The next document of note is a DAS report dated February 7, c 1979. It indicates that Jody's abuse had indeed been chronic and not episodic, as had been reported, earlier. One recommendation was that she receive psychotherapy separately from the parents. If Jody were discovered to have been abus.ed a single time more, all of the children should be removed from the home, accord~ng to the report. During the week of February 13, 1~79, a public school nurse had checked Susan IIfrom head to foot\" i~nd found the followiI)g: a swollen and bruised thumb; infected s:titcheson her forearm; a sore on her toe; and other marks. Su,?an eXPlained away all of these marks as accidents of one ,sort or another. A.school social worker writing to DCFS stated that ~t had not been unusual for Susan to appea~ at school bruised or scratched up. He ~dded that it had been difficult to get Susanto acbnit what appeared to be -136-,I , ! !t j u I I ! happening in her home. Just the week before this letter had been wr~tten, though\" Susan had told school personnel that she was very fr~ghtened concerning her home situation and that she had been packing her bags because her mother had threatened to send her back to Jamaica. This letter was to present information only, not to make recommendations. Such was not the case when the school social worker wrote DCFS again on March 21, 1979. The social worker had received a letter from Susan's mother indicating her dissatisfaction with school therapy for the girl. The social worker adds that it is customary to cease counseling in cases of parental disapproval. The letter ends: Therefore, unless school authorities or faculty report an in\u00ad cident of abuse, or if the court makes it possible for me to continue seeing Susan, I will discontinue service as of today. I am sorry to do this because I feel that it is in the best interests of the child that she receives social work services in school. It is iL1portant that I provide a monitoring func\u00ad tion, as well as help Susan with school and home adjustment. On March 16, 1979, by order of the Juvenile Court, Jody was removed from the custody of her parents and placed in the Lydia Homes for Children, part of the Lydia Home Association. Follow\u00ad ing placement, the parents contested the judge's order; he ruled that Jody remain under state guardianship. At this time, Susan remained in the pome; DCFS was attempting to find long-term place\u00adment for Jody. ,. Commission investigators spoke with a social worker at the Lydia Home in June, 1981. Only three days prior to our interView, staff there had a discussion regarding the release of Jody to her parents. Several interested parties had attended the meeting, incl,udinga psychiatrist from Children's Memorial Hospital who had recently done a workup on Jody. He told the group that Jody should be sent home permanently. At the time of our interview, plans had been to send Jody home only on Sundays; further plans were to send her home for entire weekends and then permanently. One stipulation regarding her return home was that she receive twice-weekly therapy at Children's Memorial Hospital. The psychia\u00adtrist indicated that the parents shoUld be involved in therapy with Jody but no plans had been made to provide for it. After Jody was placed at Lydia Homes, apparently her sister Susan became the ~egular victim of abuse. A letter from a school nurse to DCFS states that Susan had come to her with swollen and painful bruises on one arm and scratches on the other. She ad\u00ad mitted that the injuries had been inflicted upon her by h.er mother. Subsequently, Susan was removed from the qome and placed at Edison Park ~ome on March 7, 1980. Edison Park offered Susan a residential~\u00a3etting that kept her out of jeopardy and that pro\u00ad vided her with therapy to understand and deal with her prior abuser. -137- I ~ L She was allowed to attend her regular high schooL A progre~1s report of December, 1980, states that Susan had made a good ad\u00ad justment to life at Edison Park. From April through October\" 1980, the parents had attended thi,rteen counseling sessions with Su:san at the placement. Jody and her social worker had also attended the last, three sessions. They planned to continue attending, as a family, in the future. Documents f.rom Edison Park indicate that Susan's progress had been slow. Susan continued to exhibit anger toward her par\u00ad ents and, at the very best, had \"mixed feelings about her family.\" One docume'nt recommended continuing placement, therapy with the entire family present, and one day per month in her natural ho.me, unsupervised. These documents also make it clear that Susan must have been abused on a regular basis while living with maternal relatives in Jamaica. We learned through interviews with DCFS staff that both girls were allowed to return home for visits after a judge had placed a protective order on the mother not to use physical discipline on them. At one court appearance, the mother was cited for con\u00ad tempt of court because she had physically punished Jody, in spite of the prohibition. A DCFS caseworker told us . that this case was unusual for t\\'10 reasons: first, because the two younger children were allC?wed . to remain in the home following a finding of abuse of the two older siblings- second, because it is unusual for DCFS to remain involved in a cas~ for so long. She added that DCFS had given this family more chances than many families receive. She said the real prob\u00ad lem with the case was that the parents cooperated, to a greater or lesser extent, in counseling, but the abuse continued anyway. DCE'S told us that Jody was returned horne on July 20, 1981,:, with the stipulation that she continue therapy at Children's Memorr ialHospital. A DCFS work~:r:: was hopef~l that the mother also.:would become involved in family therapy. ThJ.s same worker told. us J.n August of 1981 that Susan was not to return home in the forseeable future because she still was not getting along with her mother~ At that time, the mother was still participating in therapy at Edison Park. Many of those whom we interviewed mentioned ~Tamai,can culture as a problem in this case. All agreed that Jamaican discipline is much more physical and rigorous than is considered acceptable in this country. The mother simply transplanted to this ,country the discipline that she had learned there. Also, both '3'J.rls were used to such discipline because both had spent at least part of their lives in Jamaica. Jamaican culture tends to pulace male children on a pedestal, that explained why the older g:irlswere abused while the son remained unhurt over the years. , In this particular case, the Evanston public schools had an extraordinarily active and posit.ive role. Case files ar.e replete with letters and other documents from school officials and social -138-'Jl A I workers regarding both girls and their problems at home and in school. ~ Apparently, the father did not s.ee any reason to participate in therapy until it was obvious that he would not regain custody of his ch~::dren. The mother manipulated the system as best she could to regain control of her children. Although' she participated in counseling, she learned little. One of the school officials deeply involved with the case mentioned the abuse by the foster parent on Jody. She noted that DCFS caseworkers had indicated in case notes and other documents several times that Jody had provoked the abuse. She complained that DCFS should make it clear to foster parents that they will not be receiving children who are entirely \"normal\" for placement in their homes. She felt in this case, and as a matter of general policy, that foster parents should be made aware of the nature of a child's problem and behavior and that all foster parents should receive appropriate training. She said that instead of preparing foster parents for mental, phYSical, and behavioral prob\u00ad lems, DCFS workers instead waited for problems to surface in fos\u00adter placements. Even then, in most cases, children were removed from the foster home and returne.d to the original abusive setting, as happened with Jody. If this same case came into the child protective system today, its outcome should be very different than it has been with this family. DCFS' Division of Child Protection (DCP) performs all investigations of abuse reports. An agency such as CAFA would i. not be involved in the case initially at all. An agency such as CAFA might become involved as a community resource providing spe\u00adcific serVices, such as counseling, once the abuse is \"founded.\" The State\u00b7 Central Registry should have been an aid in this par\u00ad ticular case because it keeps track of all cases of alleged or founded abuse for a number of years. Sending a child to another country could not thwart the system today, at least in theory. If this case came to the attention of DCFS today, therapy would be h~ndled in the same way--through contractual agencies. Hopefully, however, more of an effort would be made to coordinate services and to assure that both mother and daughters attended therapy together. Hopefully, today DCFS planning would include the father as a more active participant; we also hope that plan\u00ad ning would be done on a long-term basis earlier than it was in this case. Also, the mother's ability to manipulate should have been recognized ~arly on, and stt10nger action by DCFS and/or the court might have been taken. The suggestion of the psychologist at St. Francis Guidance Center to provide counseling at a time when the family was more receptive to it should not have been used as a r~ason for all counseling to stop. The family should have been referred elsewhere. This case presents what ~~me psychiatrists described as a pathological attitude by the mother toward at least one of her daughters. Compounding this problem was that of cultural differ- C:-I -139-~~-------. ---- -------- ----------~~~------------~----~.------------------- PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT TYPE OF CAIN PHYSICAL XNDICATORS PHYSICAL ABUSE PHYSICAL NEGLECT SEXUAL ABUSE EMOTIONAL ~TREJI;TMENT Unexplained Bruises and Welts,: -on face, lips, mouth -on torso, back, buttocks, thighs -in various stages of healing -clustered, forming regular patterns -reflecting shape of article used to inflict (electric oord, belt buckle) -on several different surface areas -regularly ~ppear after absence, weekend or vacation Unexplained Burns: . -cigar, cigarette burns, espec~ally on soles, -immersion burns (sock-like, like, doughnut shape on .' -patterned like electric burner, iron I\" etc. -rope burns on arms, legs, neck or torso Unexplained Fractures: _ to skull, nose, facial structure _ in various stages of healing _ mUltiple or spiral fractures Unexplained Lacerations or Abrasions: _ to mouth, lips, gums, eyes _ to external genitalia Consistent Hunger, Poor Hygiene, Inappropriate Dress Consistent Lack of Supervision, Especially in Dangerous Activities or Long Periods Unattended Physical Problems or Medisal Needs Abandonment Difficulty in walking or Sitting Torn, Stained or Bloody Underclothing Pain or Itching in Genital Area Bruises or Bleeding in External Genitalia, Vaginal or Anal Areas Venereal Bisease, Especially in Pre\u00ad teens Pregnancy Speech Disorders Lags in Physical Development Failure-to-thrive BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS Wary of Adult Contacts Apprehensive When Other Children Cry Behavioral Extremes: -aggressiveness, or -withdrawal Frightened of Parents Afraid to go Home Reports Injury by Parents Begging, Stealing Food Extended Stays at School (early arrival and late departure) Constant Fatigue, Listlessness or Falling Asleep in Class Alcoholic or Drug Abuse Delinquency (e.g. thefts) States There is No Caretaker Unwilling to Change for Gym or Participate in Physical Education Class Withdrawals, Fantasy or Infantile Behavior Bizarre, Sophisticated, or Unusual Sexual Behavior or Knowledge Poor Peer Relationships Delinquent or Run Away Reports Sexual Assault bJ[Caretaker Habit Disorders (sucking, biting~ rocking, etc.) Conduct Disorders (antisocial, destructive, etc.) Neuro.tic Traits (sleep disorderq, inhibition of play) Psychoneurotic Reactions compulsion, Behavior Passi~e. aggressive, demanding , .

At some point it is only logical that DCFS deCide that a family must conform to societal standards of child care or for\u00adfeit the right to care for children who are being abused. In this case, the mother had y~ars of professional counseling to learn from her mistakes and correct theIn, but she never did. Any par\u00ad ent whose only comment about the abuse sustained by Jody at the hands of her foster mother is, .\"she put bruises on top of where I marked Jody,\" has a problem that demands serious treatment. Commission staff had occasion to address several issues re\u00ad garding this case with a DCFS supervisor. He told us that he felt the case had been handled extremely well and that in some ways' 'it was a model case. The supervisor explained that he felt that all of the family members were actively communicating with one another through counseling seSSions. At the time of our inter\u00ad view in 1981, the goal was S\\}ill reunification of this familv. It is important that professionals and o\u00b7thers learn to recognize indications of child abuse. School personnel in this case paid close attention to the two girls and were able to intervene when they felt that the girls were being abused. D. Paul Paul was born on October 21, 1.978. He sustained injuries to his leg on May 24, 1979, allegedly as a result of parental abuse. Paul was hospitalized the following day and DCFS took cus\u00adtody'of the child o~ May 30,,1979. On April 11, 19~0, Judge Arthur N. Hamilton entered a finding of neglect reg~.rding the par\u00ad ents and cited them for maintaining an environment injurious to the health of their child. Paul. was then placed in foster :care, in which he remains to this day. The natural parents in this case had a prior history of abuse with DCFS. Their daughter, Diana, born November 20, 1974, was placed in adoptive care in 1979 after being abused by her parents. Another daughter had dieq in the home, supposedly of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, in 1977. Some caseworkers viewed the death as highly suspicious, but there was no evidence to substantiate death by unnatural causes. One of the p~ople we interviewed was an assistant statees attorney who had been the CPS worker on the case while employed at DCFS. After rece~ving an anonymous calIon May 24, 1979, with respect to Paul's injuries, she told us, DCFS workers contacted the family and persuaded them to take Paul to Illinois Masonic Hospital for treatment. Doctors there stated that Paul's injur\u00ad ies could not have been s'elf-inflicte&,or caused in the manner described to them by the parents. The former CPS worker told us that she made a very quick debermination that the ,pa:rents were unfit and that adoption would be the best course to pursue for Paul t s sake if drasti~c steps CQuid not immediately rehabilitate the parents. She mentioned that this was the only case she could -141-------------- ---~-~-----~ recall in which such a decision had been made so quickly; she was influenced principally by reading of the parents' prior history of abuse and by the atti~ude and lack of concern shown by the mother. The worker was also concerned that while the father might not have been an active abuser, he did not appear to be strong enough to prevent further abuse from occuring. She added that Paul's injur\u00ad ies seemed to be duplicates of Diana's abuse and that neither par\u00ad ent would even admit that Paul had been injured. Finally, the mother completely refused to cooperate in any way with DCFS. She had ~sked both parents to sign the service plan but they refused, sayfng there was nothing wrong with them and that they didn't need any help. A Commission investigator also spoke with an emergency room social worker at Illinois Mason-ic. She was a. member of the hos\u00ad pital's SCAN team (Suspected Child Abuse/Neglect) that made the determination that Paul probably had been abused. She told us the parents said that Paul had injured his leg by sticking it be\u00ad tween the slats of his crib. The social worker told us that even if he had done what the parents had described, he would not have sustained a chip fracture and heavy bruises to the leg. She did not think it likely that Paul would have wedged his leg through the slats because he did not appear to be a very active baby. Paul also had a bruise on his nose, a bruise on one upper eyelid, and a bruise on his right buttock. The mother explained these injuries away by saying that her son was very active. How\u00ad ever, the social worker told us that the child was so inactive that originally he had been diagnC?sed as \"develqpmentally delayed.\" The social worker also told us that the mother appeared to be defensive, guarded, and agitated. When asked questions about! Paul's injuries, she often would answer, \"none of your business.1I Following Paul's admission to the hospital, both parents did visit, but-the mother did not come as often. The soc ia 1 worker f e It the: t; the father acted appropriately toward his son, while the mother .,,\u00ad did not. Both parents refused all offers of counseling from staff at Illinois Masonic. A Commission investigator interviewed the DCFS worker who took the anonymous child abuse telephone call and who interviewed Paul's parents on May 24, one day bef6re the parents brought the baby to the hospital. (This was not the CPS worker assigned to handle the case after Paul's hospital admission.) She told us that she was unaware of any prior abusive history with this fam\u00ad ily when she made the home visit on May 24, because the previous abusive incidents had occurred in another county. At the time of those incidents, the state had no computer soundex system which could have alerted her to an abuse history in another part of the state. When she went to the parents' home to interview them, she knew that Paul had been abused. She told us that the parents \\ could offer only poor excuses and inconsistent explanations re\u00add garding the baby's injuries. At the time, she felt that there I -142-, ) :\"ti ' , ; ~ t 'f was no way the child could have incurred the injuries as described by the parents. She also mentioned that she had seen the same types of injuries on abused children before, and had heard the same sorts of explanations from parents before. Further, she felt that Paul was too \"placidll a baby even to attempt to climb through his crib as the parents had described. We asked why the worker did not demand that the parents take the child to the hospital immediately, or why she had not taken emergency custody of the child. She responded that, although the mother denied the seriousness of the Situation, by the time she concluded the interview, the parents \"might\" have been willing to take Paul to the hospital on their own. Also, the father had been very cooperative. Furthermore, since she knew the case to be ser~ous, she said she knew a follow-up team from DCFS would be sent to the home the following morning if the parents failed to take the child to the hospital. As we have noted, the parents took Paul to the hospital the following afternoon. When we asked the worker if she would handle the case dif\u00ad ferently today, with the aid of hindsight, she said that she would: \"Knowing what I know now about her [Paul's mother], I would get the police.\" CommisSion analysis of DCFS records reveals that on May 25, 1979, a CPS worker called a DCFS field officer in Kankakee, re\u00ad questing information on the other child in the family, Diana, who had been adopted. The CPS worker learned from the field officer that DCFS was involved with the family in 1975, when Diana was only three months old. At that time, 75% of Diana'S ribs had been broken and were in eight different stages of healing, she had a skull fracture, and she was extremely malnourished. The field officer said that the parents appeared to have no remorse for what they had done, and though DCFS workers \"practically lived at their house\" for a period of time, no improvement ever was made. This same field officer also said that after Diana had been placed in foster care, the parents never attempted to visit her until she had been in placement for more than a year. Even after that, they failed to show up for most of their scheduled appoint\u00ad ments. ,After two years, the parents went to a mental health cen\u00ad ter for therapy but refused to cooperate in counseling. This worker also recalled that, over a year before, she had received a call from a Chicago hospital stating that a sibling of Diana had been brought in DOAat;age two months. At the time of her death, she weighed less ~han her birth weight. The DCFS records also indicate that the mother had given an entirely different account of Paul's injuries to an emergency room nurse than she had given to others involved with the case. She told the nurse that Paul had hurt himself when she left him in a chair to go get the maiL\u00b7\u00b7 She said that he had fallen out of the chai:u-and sustained injuries that way'~ o -143-When the mother left the hospital the day that Paul was ad\u00ad mitted, she refused to allow hospital per.sonnel to feed him any fruits or vegetables, stating that he needed only whole milk and meat. By the time he was released from the hospital, he had gained weight and no longer appeared malnourished, and had become more active. On June 7, 1979, the CPS worker made the following recommenda\u00adtion: Due to the past history of this family, no evidence that the [parents] have taken any action that would enable them to be\u00ad come effective parents, Paul's serious injuries, and the [par\u00ad ents;] lack of remorse, uncooperativeness; this worker believes that Paul's interests will best be served by quickly freeing him for adoption if the [parents] do not make any effort at rehabilitation. The final notation in the record is that the case was being referred to another worker for private agency long-term foster care, with the recommendation that Paul be placed in a prospec\u00ad tive adoptive home. Basically, the DCFS plan was to continue to maintain Paul in foster placement, provide needed medical care for him, and-al\u00ad low the natural parents their court-ordered Visits. Children's Home and Aid Society (CHAS) \\'las~to provide counseling for the par\u00ad ents each week, supervise visits betweeri the natural parents and Paul, and continue to submit regular progress reports to the Juven\u00ad ile Court as required. In speaking with the CHAS social worker assigned to this case, we learned that the worker knew very little about the history of , the fa,mily she was treating except that a daughter had died and i, another had peen placed in adoptive care. The worker was unaware! of the reason for termination of parental rights for Diana. She' didi,!iknow that the parents had been involved in some sort of coun\u00ad seling regarding their daughter Diana but, that it had failed;. The worker said that the parents had been. very vague about this counseling and only told her that it took place somewhere in Will County. The worker explained that her function ,was to c;}ssist the par\u00ad ents in understanding the proper attitude toward their son and to assist in the supervision of paren,tal visits. She told us that the parents consistently had denied abusing Paul, that they felt they had been the victims of \"vengeful\" neighbors who had made the anonymous call, and that the court had based its decision on what had happened with their daughter Diana. \\ She was seeing the parents weekly when we interliewed her. While there had been some cancellations, generally the parents ' made their apPointments. However, the worker mention~d that the parents were resistive to the intended effects of counseling: they saw counseling as a means to regain custody their I rather than as an opportunity to correct their own problems. She described their interaction with Paul: the father consistently \\-'las affectionate and \"fatherly\" toward Paul in his visits, whi.le the mother was much more nervou~ and sometimes did not show up for visitation. The CHAS worker told us that the mother is a very immature woman. As a child she was abandoned and subsequently spent a great deal of time in foster homes. She had never developed trust in parental figures. The worker 'saw hope in the father~s approach to his son, though. The worker told us that though it was apparent the parents had been neglectful toward Paul at the time he was hospitalized, she did not feel that they had abused him. When asked how she would feel if Paul were immediately returned to the parents, she told us that \"she did not feel the parents would abuse him. She quickly added that she had her apprehensions about the mother, though. She characterized the mother as a very needy perso:q: her\u00ad self, and that if s~e had a bad day, undoubtedly she would deal with her own problem~ and probably neglect Paul. Then the worker also mentioned that the parents both lack good common sense and would be likely to neglect Paul's medical needs. (A tumor in Paul's kidney was diagnosed, after he had been placed in foster care.) The worker told us that the parents would be up for review in July, 1981. She conceded that they might not be granted cus\u00ad tody of Paul but that she wanted \"to continue counseling and not \"throw in the towel.\" During our second conversation with this worker, we learned that her original case plqn was developed on February 24, 1981. The father signed the plan on March 17, but the mother was not present to also sign. Later, when she read the plan, she refused to sign it because she did not agree that she needed weekly coun\u00ad seling, nor did she ag+ee that she needed to strengthen her par\u00ad enting skillso On October 20, 1981, both parents signed a plan developed by the CRAS worker. The new plan called for bi-weekly visits at the CHAS offices between th~ pa~ents and Paul, s~pervised by CHAS workers. Each of these visits would be followed by one hour of counseling with the eRAS caseworker. The parents were expected to acknowledge mar,ital problems that led to Paul's abuse, acknow\u00ad ledge parental problems that led to,Paul's removal from the ho~e, and show serious concern and Common., sense, regarding Paul' s med~\u00ad cal condition and what to do if he suddenly became ill. Commissiol).i~ staff also analyzed CHASdoc~f11ents that reflect chronological contacts with the 'parents. There were a total of 42 contacts that shou(l,d have included visitations with Paul and/or counseling with the CHAS c~seworker. ' Of the 42 contacts, the ~ar\u00ad ents oancelled without cau,5e 24 of. them. Following each such can\u00ad cellation, a letter was sent to ., \\ -145-Ii! 4;; 4Qll .. - their obligation to appear or cancel contacts in advance and with good cause. Of the 18 contacts that were made, three were par-tial in that they involved only one parent, the parents just visited with Paul, or the parents just came for counseling. It is interesting to note that the parents failed five of eight contacts after the new plan was developed. Further, after the service plan expired on January 19, 1982, CHAS continued coun\u00ad seling without any new service plan. As of March, 1982, counsel\u00ad ing by CHAS continued in spite of the decision to terminate their parental rights to Paul. A Commission investigator spoke with a supervisor in Adop\u00ad tions for DCFS, who told us that Paul's case was transferred to the Adoption Unit in November, 1980. She told us that the plan of DCFS Adoptions was not to offer any direct service to the par\u00ad ents but to allow CHAS to continue its counseling, with occasional DCFS monitoring. She added that workers in Adoptions \"had seen little parental progress and felt that counseling couL.'''.:' go on for\u00ad ever with nothing changing. This worker explained to us the necessity of having a good service plan signed by both parents. In the absence of such a plan, at a hearing to terminate parental rights, the parents could claim that they had never known what was expected of them and there\u00ad fore were incapable of meeting agency goals. Following a February 20, 1981 screening of this case, CHAS did not consider adoption to be the best plan for Paul. The DCFS Adoptions worker, on the other hand, thought it to be the best plan by far, based on the length of time that Paul had bee:n in foster care, his age and degree of attachment to his fostr./r par\u00ad ents his medical problems, and, most importantly, the lack of prog;ess by the natural parents. She made it clear that if th~ natural parents really could indicate some progress, then term~\u00ad nation of their rights would be reconsidered. Our investigator asked her what would happen if a couple de\u00ad cided not to rehabilitate but to attend counseling regularly in order to get' \u00b7their child returned to them. She admitted that: if a family were sophisticated enough to know \"how the game ist/layed,\" there would not be much anyone could do about it. As long as par\u00ad ents ,show an interest in their child, there is not too much that workers or court personnel can do about it. She also commented that someone can go through long-term counseling and get nothing from it. Her unit was in the process of devising a service plan that would minimize the possibility of anyone attempting to sim- ply drift through the system in this way. In May of 1981, a Commission investigator interviewed the assistant state's attorney handling the case. She told us that she felt the parents had achieved a good deal of progress toward rehabilitation\u00b7 at the same time, they had far to go before Paul could be retur~ed to themo She told us that, based on informa\u00ad tion presented at the most recent hearing, there were instrfficient grounds for termination of parental rights. -146-The assistant state's attorney told us that she too had been impressed with the father's attitude toward his son, but the mother left a good deal to be desired. She also said that the court will not terminate parental rights based on the action or inaction of only one of the parents. Both parents must be found to be unfit. We asked the assistant state's attorney how the court or the workers assigned to a case could determine whether parents really were being rehabilitated or simply going through the motions. She stressed that standards in these cases are necessarily very subjective, but a good social worker will notic-e any inconsisten\u00ad cies in approaches to the child taken by the parents. Such incon\u00ad sistencies should, be enough to raise doubts concerning thee parents' real motives toward regaining custody of the child., She told us that if the parents continued to make progress, the adoptions screening committee would not seek termination of parental rights. She added that, in all likelihood, another six\u00ad month extension would be granted at the next court hearing and a revised service plan to prepare both Paul and his parents for his return home ~puld be implemented. Since these interviews, we have learned that the case went before the screening committee on March 5, 1982, at which time DCFS filed a petition for termination of parental rights. The basis for the petition was failure by the natural parents to cor\u00ad rect behavior and make reasonable progress toward rehabilitation~ We were told that if the parents decided to contest the termina\u00ad tion decision, as they had done with their daughter Diana, the case might go to trial around September, 1982. Based on other cases of this nature, the trial probably would take a year to com\u00ad plete. If uncontested, we were told, Paul could be free for adop\u00ad tion in six months. E. Lucine 'J:he fifth case of abuse that we will present occurred in Des Plaines, Illinois, on July 11, 1980. Two-month~old Lucine was ' taken b~, her mother to Holy Family Hospital. The case came to the at,t'ention of the Des Plaines Police Department and a police officer called DCFS on the same date to notify them of an injury to a child. Lucine's mother told DCFS caseworkers, that her husband came home from work about 3:30 p.m. and found Lucine crying. He sat down on the f,loor next to her, grabbed her by the right arm and leg, and flipped her over so that she fell on her knees. He then took Lucine upstair$ to change her, where he held her upside down and dropped her on the bassinet. The mother ,took her to the emer\u00ad gency room for treatment of a fractured right leg. Lucine was admitted for further observation. Eventually, her leg was put in traction, and she was treated for head, neck, and back injuries. -147-, I I Although DCFS registry checks indicated no prior abuse his\u00ad tory, DCFS workers learned that the father had beaten both his wife and his daughter on several occasions. At the time of this inciden't, Lucine had two older sisters living in the horne with her. When CPS workers contacted the mother following Lucine's hospitalization, she told them she plan\u00ad ned to move the other girls to her brother's horne in Chicago, where they would be taken care of by their grandmother. CPS workers also learned that Holy Family Hospital Emergency Room records re\u00ad flected treatment of Lucine just two weeks earlier. At that time she had been treated for bruises on the buttocks, arm, and face. CPS arranged for Holy Family Hospital personnel to examine Lucine's sisters for possible signs of abuse before they were placed with their uncle. Neither showed any sign of physical abuse. On July 11, the father was arrested and charged with beating his wife and aggravated battery of his daughter. We examined the case notes of the principal CPS investigator assigned to this case. They reflect a five-day period of investi\u00ad ~tion. This worker characterized the abuse of Lucine as the most serious that could be designated on the investigation form. On July 14, he contacted staff at Holy Family Hospital, repre\u00ad sentatives of the Des Plaines Police Department, the family doc\u00ad tor, the mother, and both of Lucine' s sisters. The following day \\. . he spoke with the investigating officer of the Des Plaines Police' Department. The day afte~ he spoke with the girls' aunt and other officers of the Des Plaines Police Department. The Des plaines police report confirms much of what is stated in the DCFS case notes, adding some detail. When the father carne home about 3:30, the family's two dogs began to bark and Lucine began to cry_ The father offered Lucine a bottle, which she re~ fused. He then shattered the bottle against the wall, saying, \"If she doesn't ~lant her bottle, she'll starve!\" Next he flipped the child over in mid-air so that she landed face-first on his leg. Finally, the father carried his daughter upstairs, shook her by the leg, a.nd dropped her head-first from about six inches above the changing table. When his wife confronted him, he struck her in the throat and then gave her Lucine. Without a telephone, the mother had to wait for her own mother to get home with a car. The CPS investigator's notes state that the mother c'laimed to have seen bruises on Lucine four to six weeks before July 11, and that she may have seen similar bruises on her other daughters. She said that she suspected her husband of beating the girls but could never prove it because., he never did it in front of anyone-\u00ad unt il he broke Luc :Lne 's leg Although the mother compared her husband to an \"animal\" who would kill her daughters if left alone -148-r r I I long enough, she had dropped her intentions of pursuing a divorce because she had no money to live on her own. The CPS worke(~), recommendation was that the mo~her and the grandmother be given a chance to take care of the ch1ldren, as long as \"extensive counseling and protective services monitoring\" were provided to both of them. It was also recommended that re\u00ad sources be directed toward getting the mother involved in community\u00ad based counseling so that she could respond appropriately to her children's needs in the future (that is, she should not wait several hours to take one of her children to the hospital if badly injured). When these case notes were written, the father was already incarcerated. The notes state that when he is released from pri\u00ad son, he must be given intensive counseling if he is to return horne so that the abuse will not recur. il The case was referred to Family Guidance Centers. The Glen\u00ad view FGC was to provide intensive counseling and protective ser\u00ad vice monitoring. Commission investigators spoke with Bruce Paynter, a Cook County Assistant State's Attorney, who confirmed that the father had been arrested.and charged with aggravated battery and battery for the injuries inflicted on his wife and daughter. When we spoke with Paynter on October 23, 1980, he ~old US that several hearings had been held but that the case had not yet corne to trial because the father had an unrelated jury trial on a burglary charge pend<\u00ad ing in DuPage County that was to begin on November 17. Paynter said the outcome of that trial was crucial to his own handling of the trial for aggravated battery and battery. Paynter mentioned that all child abuse cases are difficult to prosecute in court, and this one was no exception. One f~ctor that probably would enter into the discussion in c,?urt was s1mply the mother's word against the father's. Further! 1t was unclear from several reports whether Lucine's leg might have bee~ broken before the father picked her up and dropped her. If Luc1ne had been irritable before that, as apparently she was, she might have sustained the 'injury some other way. That the parents strug<:!led with one another while the father continued to hold onto LUC1ne further obfuscated the issue; it might be difficult, Paynter told us, to prove that the father. had caused the injuries and not the mother--or both parents together, inadvertently. paynter wanted to await the outcome of th,e other trial be- ,fore settling on a prosecuting strategy. If the father were found guilty of burglary in DuPage county, he could accept a plea agree\u00ad ment on the battery charges and the father would have to serve his two sentences concurrently. If the father were foun~ ~n~o\u00ad cent on the burglary charges, Paynter said he would not 1n1t1ate a plea agreement with him but would go to i:;rial. -149-i; Ultimately, the father pled guilty to the burglary charges and was sentenced to three years in the Department of Corrections I minimum security facility, where he was to undergo psychiatric testing following alleged suicide attempts. The father entered into a plea agreement on the charge of aggravated battery and, on February 24, 1981, was sentenced to four years in prison. The four-year sentence was to run concurrently with the three-year sentence for battery, less time served. Lucine's father was paroled on April 2, 1982, with discharge from parole scheduled for July 11, 1984. Our investigators spoke with a DCFS supervj,sor regarding this case. He told us that he had visited the home himself and found the mother I s house orderly and the children fine'. He said that the mother hoped to receive her GED and eventual:ly find a job. Because the mother was doing well and the father was still in pri\u00ad son, DCFS closed its case on the family on Septe:mber 16, 1981. The supervisor told us that before closing the case, DCFS staff told the mother how to apply for Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) benefits and how to contact Parents Under Stress for support. We also spoke with two representatives of the Family Guidance Centers. Family Guidance Centers provide comprehensive mental health services to both children and adults for a variety of prob\u00ad lems. Under the Centerls DCFS contract, comprehensive psycho\u00ad social treatment and intervention for abused and neglected chil\u00ad dren and their families\",when referred by CPS, are provided. The goal of these services is to keep children out of placement. We were told that the mother had been receiving two hours of counseling each week, beginning in July, 1980. One of the work\u00ad ers told us that the mother was only 19 years old and already had three children to care for. She had been extremely dependent cn her husband and even upon her mother, with whom she lived inter.\u00b7\u00b7 mittently. The mother knew the father was abusive but did not know what she could do about it. She had wanted (1 divorce but did not have money for legal fees or to raise the children. The mother was very nervous just seeing her husband at the trial and was very anxious about his being released from ja~7. At the time of our interview, we were told that the mother had become more realistic about her situation, ha~J been looking for new living arrangements, and had acquired a nig'ht-time job at a pizza parlor. BeQause she had been living witl1 her mother, no homemaker servtces were proferred. We were also told that one of the older daughters had adjusted well to the chaijges in her life, but that Lucine still did rtot trust people. The mother and her children received counseling I at F'amily Guidance Centers from July, 1980, to August, 1981, when the agen\u00ad cy closed its case with the family. Final recommenda\\tions were that the mother apply for ADC benefits; that she cont\\,~nue working ',' toward her GED; that she find a \"satisfying\" job and appropriate day care for her three children; and that she contact \\Parents Under -150-i? , , t i I il r t I' ~ \" ;. ~ ~ ., I I i I Stress--virtually the same recommendations as those referred to by DCFS. The case is now officially closed. F. Conclusion 1. An Overview of the Problem 1 thought I was the lowest-down sonofabitch that could ever walk, t~ harm my child that way. After I beat her, r felt guilty the whole damn day. I w?Uld sit home and think about how rot\u00ad ten I wa,s. Then I would tell myself that if she didn't deserve it one \"\"ay, she deserved it another. She was trouble, but she didn't deserve ,what I was dishing out. * ?\\ lot elf times, I hoped somebody would have caught up with me. I was sending her to school with black and blue marks allover her and she couldn't sit down. But the Chicago schools never said n<.)thing. It really seemed like they could have cared less. It was ,only when I moved out to the suburbs that the schools caught u,P with me. * The way y,ou were raised is the way you swear you will never raise ym11Fkids and it ends up that way because you don't know any other~\\'lay to do it. '\\ , These corrunents were all made by parents who had abused their ch~ldren. ,They were quoted anonymously in an article in the Chicago Sun Times on March 6, 1980. All were members of Parents Anonymous, a national group that gets abusive parents together to discuss any problems that members may have and which will be discussed later in this concluding section. ' Some abusive parents love their children very much. Some do not intend to hurt their children. Others do not seem ,to com\u00ad prehend wh~t ~hey are doing par\u00ad ents are v~ct~ms themselves--v~ctims of abuse when they were chil\u00ad dren, victims of spouse abuse, Victims of an isolation with which they cannot d7al. Many have become parents While still very young. They have no ~dea what a parentis responsibilities are or how to care for and properly discipline children. Many neglect their children simply out of ignorance, not malice. Others are malicious. Some intend to harm their children. Some, as we will see in the next chapter6 inflict such harm that their children die. Luckily, these people are in the minority. Regardless what' a parentis intention may be, the result can be the same. An abused child is just as abused if the abuse is inflicted intentionally or by \"accident.\" c, The amount and intensity of violence in our society--particu\u00ad larly toward the young--is a logical starting point in understand- -15')-\",Sd' \"\"T~ ing the dynamics of child abuse and neglect. One book that ad\u00ad dresses this issue is Behind Closed Doors: Violehce in the Ameri\u00ad can Family, by Murray A. Straus, Richard J. G~lIes, and Suzanne K. Steinmetz (1980). All findings come from a 1976 survey of 960 men and 1,183 women. The major limitations of the study are lack of results from single-parent families, an interview completion rate of 65%, and exclusion of data from families in which all of the children were under the age of three at the time of the survey. The early statistics indicate that American attitudes toward slapping and spanking seem to be very libera.l. Seventy percent of the respondents viewed slapping or spanking a 12-year-old as necessary; 77% thought that such an action was normal\u00b7 and 71% viewed either act as \"good.\" The authors discovered that child\u00ad less persons more often sanctioned slapping and spanking than did those with children of their own. Younger respondents were more likely to view slapping and spanking 2S necessary, normal, or good. The greatest number who saw these sanctions as necessary were under 30. However, a significantly high number of respondents over 50 agreed. According to the authors' projections from this study, the following would occur sometime between the ages of three and seven\u00ad teen for the average American child: 71% of children would be slapped or spanked; 46% would be pushed or shoved; 20% would be hit with an object; 8% would be bitten, kicked or punched; 3% would be threatened with violence with a gun or knife or would have a gun or a knife used on them; and 73% would experience some form of violence at the hands of their parents. The authors I research told them that males tend to be beate.n or more severely punished more often than females, perhaps beca~(se our society thinks that violence \"toughens them up. II ! These three researchers repeat the opil\\,ion cited earlier in this report that Midwesterners seem to be more violent toward their children than people from other areas of the country. The authors conclude from their research that unless we want violence to escalate in American families, we must change some of ourwost fundamental attitudes and beliefs. According to two of the foremost experts on the subject of child abuse and neglect, Ruth S. Kempe and Henry Kempe . (Child Abuse, 1980), abuse occurs in the presence of four factors: (1) the par\u00ad ents have a background of e~otional and physical deprivation and perhaps abuse as well; (2) a child is seen as unlovable or dis\u00ad appointing; (3) there is a crisis; and (4) no effective \"lifeline II or link to sources of aid, exists at the moment of crisis. ' The Kempes state: -152-With child abuse the whole family is disturbed and not each needy member alone. Experience over the past twenty years has taught us that it is futile, and even disastrous, to return an abused child repeatedly to a family that exists in name only, that is not and never will be capable of providing a nurturing environment, and that may well destroy the child unless he is promptly and permanently removed. But is it possible to make such .grave diagnostic assessments of families early in treat\u00ad ment? In general, it is not only possible, but essential--and often lifesaving. Further, to stop incurable parents from de\u00ad stroYlllg their child is an act of mercy not only to him but to them as well. This is one of those areas where society must look after the best interests of all concerned, through early intervention by the court as parens patriae. All the disas\u00b7t.ers we experienced took place in situations where optimism about the successful progress of therapy was allowed to overrule the evidp.nce. The Kempes cite the fourth factor--the absence of a \"lifeline\"-\u00ad as the most significant factor in child abuse situations. In an article entitled liThe Role of Individual and Social Support in Preventing Child Maltreatmentll (in Protecting Children from Abuse ~Neglect: Developing and Maintaining Support Systems for Fami\u00ad lies), Benjamin Gottlieb presents a list of \"impediments to forma\u00ad tion of supportive social ties. II They are: --Family members lack the skills necessary to maintain suppor\u00ad tive relationships. --Family members participate in few social situations so that there is little opportunity to form supportive relationships. --Family members are overburdened by the demands of everyday liv\u00ad ing to the point that there is no time to develop personal at\u00ad tachments. --Family members subscribe to the norm of self-reliance in mat\u00ad ters pertaining to the management of stress, particularly stress relating to the parenting role. Family isolation as a contributing factor in child abuse and neglect leads the Kempes, in fhild Abuse, to state: . Child abuse is less common in families who have other relations living with them. Children in these extended families can count on a number of loving adults for protection and care. If fami\u00ad lies could come to lead les's isolated lives in the community, so that the arrival of a new baby in the neighborhood were again a reason for community celebration and the parents could turn for support to a larger circle of neighbors and friends, then children's well-being would be far better assured. -153-'-, --,,-------- ------.,-~----- Jose D. Alfaro directed a study entitled \"Summary Report on the Relationship Between Child Abuse and Neglect and Later Socially Deviant Behavior \" for the New York Select Cqnunittee on Child Abuse (1978) (\"the fir~t, and perhaps the only, legislative conunittee devoted solely to the issues of child abuse and negl~ct\"). In this study, both child abuse and neglect ar~ placed ~n the broader perspective of the victim and abuser in soc~ety. The study makes clear, through specific findings, that unles'~$ abuse and neglect are addressed inunediately and comprehensively, other members of society will pay a price. The report's preface quotes ,Dr. Sher,:,ert,Frazie~, once Deputy Director of the Columbia Univers~ty Psych~atr~c Inst~tute, who refers to his study of murderers, all of whom had been \"the vic\u00ad tims of remorseless physical brutality when they were children,\" and also to Judge Nanette Dembitz of New York City Family Court, who said that \"the root of crime in the streets is the neglect of children.\" The\u00b7 study suggests a \"definite relationship\" be\u00ad tween child maltreatment and juvenile criminality: n[M]altreated children have a significantly greater likelihood of becoming de\u00ad linquent or ungovernable. Though the ~a~a i~ ~n wh~ch abuse or neg lect have occurred is considerably higher than among the general population of children living in the same conununities.\" The aut.hors refer, in their section on specific findings, to the fact that they relied on official rec~rds for the~r.infor\u00ad mation. They note that one problem with rel~ance on off~c~al re\u00ad cords is simply that child abuse and neglect are under-r~ported: despite registries, hotlines, and publicity, child maltreatment is not reported as frequently as it occurs. Nevertheless, the study found that as many as 50% of the fa~i\u00ad lies reported for abuse or neglect had at. least. one child take~ ':1' to court as either delinquent or ungovernable; ~n the county w~t ~ the most complete set of records, 64% of the families were in.that situation. In the county with the best rep~rts, the rate o~ Juven\u00ad ile delinquency and ungovernability among children who had neen :. reported as abused Or neglected was five times greater than among the general population. In three counties, 35% of the boys and 44% of the girls re\u00ad ported to a court as either delinquent or ungovernable had pre\u00ad viouslybeen reported as abused or neglected. Children repor~ed as abused or neglected tend to be more violent than other d~l~n\u00ad quents. As an example 6f this violence ratio, the study po~nts out that in the general population of delinquents, less than 1% of all delinquency contacts were related to homicides, ,but a~ong the abuse/neglect delinquents, this percentage was an ~ncred~ble 29%. Finally, selected short excerpts from the study's conclusion follow.: -154-I I, j I I , I One fact is resoundifigiy clear: a considerable percentage of children, as seen in both the 1950's and the 1970's sample, were abused or neglected and reported as delinquent or ungovern\u00ad able when they were older. An important factor in the relationship between child maltreat\u00ad ment and juvenile misbehavior, highlighted in this study, is the amazing lack of services provided to most children and fami\u00ad lies. The complaint that we have improved reporting laws but .) few services are available to respond to new cases is almost universal. In both samples in the study, the prime services provided, if they are to be called that, were either placement or casework supervision, and for most cases, nothing else. It is possible, of course, that the families involved needed nothing else; but the outcome in terms of the later problems of many of the chil\u00ad dren indicates that more was needed, unless the children and parents are going to be discarded as hopeless. The criticism that child protective services does not do much for the child-\u00ad that it is oriented towards helping the parents--is not a novel perception, but it is true. Most services, most child protec\u00ad tive efforts, are directed towards getting the parents to stop the abuse or neglect. Little is done to help the child over\u00ad come the experience of being abused or neglected. Abused and neglected children need mental health services to undo the emo\u00ad tional damage of child maltreatment. Many of the families in the' study required intensive, long\u00ad term help--perhaps for a generation or more. In one sense, they got it in the form of repeated but intermittent involve\u00ad ments with the child protective or juvenile justice systems as individual problems were brought to the attention of agen\u00ad cies and courts. But there was no long-term commitment to sup\u00ad porting families with an organized array of services to help them overcome their prob,1,emli>\" We must face the fact that some \" families will require this kind of help for a long period of time. 2. Neglect vs. Abuse t One of the findings in Cthe report prepared for the New York Selept Conunittee on Child Abuse, cited above, is: \"The placement rate in child neglect cases was higher than in child abuse cases indicating that neglect is a more intractable problem.\" The re_1 port s~at~s that \"[t]his finding indicates that neglect may be more d~ff~cult to treat than abuse, that protective agencies find abuse more amenable to treatment. As the major study on child neglect indicates, neglect 'is chronic, pervasive, resistant to specific treatment, and transmitted in inter-generational cycles.'\" One of the series of User manuals from the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect is entitled Child Neglect: Mobilizing Services. Its authors are Carolyn Hally, Nancy F. Polansky, and Norman A. Polansky. This 1980 manual mentions that CPS should -155- take \"lead responsibility\" for the marginal or neglectful family and should,not prioritize its services to respond only or most quickly to children who apparently have been physically abused. Of course, some hard decisions regarding response and tre~'tment must be made based on the severity of the case, b~t the authors make the point that neglectful situations frequently lead to abu\u00ad sive situations, and neglect can be fatal. The report's definition of\" neglect follows: a condition in which a caretaker responsible for the child either deliberately or by extraordinary inattentiveness per\u00ad mits the child to experience available present suffering and/or fails to provide one or more of the. ingredients generally de~med essential for developing a person's physical, intellectual and emotional capacities. There are many definitions of neglect. Str~ngely ~nough, many state laws that mention child neglect are s~lent w~tt: regard to a definition, or provide a definition so broad that ~t can be ap\u00ad plied to almost any child's situation. The authors indicate that abuse generally is made up of a single or series of discrete occ~rrences, whereas negle~t tends to be chronic. They state that neglect often occurs in family situations in which one or more parent is unable to form a per\u00ad sonal relationship with a child. In discussing treatment, the authors indicate that it is pre\u00ad ferable for children to remain in their own homes, as long as pro\u00ad tection and aid can be provided so that th~ children are n~t neg\u00ad lected. Problems with removal of a child ~nclude the marg~nal quality of many foster homes, the general lack of re~ources (such as foster homes) in many areas, the trauma to the c~~ld, an~ the tendency of neglectful parents to \"replace these ch~ldren w~th , : more children.1I Finally, the authors say that it is cheaI?er to maintain children in the home thqn to remove them, a poss:j,b.l.e con\u00ad sideration in some cases. Tqe two types of care recommended as. being very helpful in most neglectful situations are day care and homemak.er services. Homemaker services involve volunteers or \"pro\u00ad fessionals\" being sent to a home to teach basic skills such as providing meals maintaining the upkeep of the home, and budget\u00ad ing income. Th~ authors state tha~ homemaker services are the most promising new service, an area that they recommend be expanded. II The authors spend a good deal of children fro~ neglectful homes. discussion follow: of time discussing placement Several e,xcerpts from their .aathe plan to place a neglected child with a substitute fam\u00ad ily must be part of, ~ independent of, an overall trea~ment plan designed to ,meet the individualized needs of the ch~ld and his or h~r parents. The responsibility for making the decision should be shared. by a team of professionals~~the CPS apd foster care supervisors and workers, a pediatric~~n, a -156-o I If \\i: l\u00b7 I I :r g , 'l J I ~ psychologist, a child development specialist, the juvenile/ family court judge--~ by the family members The parents and the child should participate as fully as possible in these dec is ions. The decision to place may be clear-cut or obfuscated by many fac\u00adtors. Placement should occur in the following situations: :::' The child is in immediate danger due to: severe malnutrition; environmental failure to thrive; abandonment by the parents; severe parental mental illness; or severe parental substance abuse. The family is experiencing a situational and temporary crisis, such as hospitalization of the mother, and emergency services such as 24-hour homemaker services are not available. However, in many cases the weaknesses of the parents in meeting their children's needs must be weighed against their strengthsr as well as against the children's attachments to the natural par\u00adents. The authors addre,ss services that should be provided to na\u00adtural parents also: In most current foster care programs, treatment for the biolo\u00ad gical parents does not;, receive sufficient attention. Improved housing, better public assistance, job training, and better physical health care can improve these parents materially. ';Supportive counseling, supplemental services, and hospitali\u00ad zation are necessary for some of these parents. Many of these parents require therapy for intrapsychic or personality prob\u00ad lems that have prevented them from being adequate parents and productive members of society. The authors of the User manual conclude that many neglected children may die or become phYSically handicapped. Those who do not almost always become \"psychologically crippled. II This entire issue of negl'ect is addressed in a paper entitled tlNeglect: Is It Neglected Too Often?\" by Al Kadushin in Child Abuse and Neglect: Issues on Innovation and Imglementati.on (1977). Kadushin states that neglect is ignored far too often .. com\u00ad pared with the attention and focus given to child abuse~( As 'evi\u00ad dence, Kadushin refers to the late adoption of state law9 requir\u00ad ing mandatory reporting of neglect; the literature, which shows t,hat between 1967 and 1977, only three books were written about child neglect, all by the same authors; and the fact that at the conference at which Kadushin ~,s paper was presented, only two of 24 workshops focused exclusively on neglect. Kadushin finds this state of affairs puzzling, to say the least, because every sta\u00adtistic he analyzed showed that many more children are neglected than are abused. The National Clearinghouse on Child Abuse twice as many cases of neglect when compared with abuse, using 1975 s'tatistics. This information showed that in states with larger cities (such as New York and Michigan), the ratio of neglect cases to abuse cases was as high as 6:1. To explain this apparent imbalance, Kadushin suggests that neglect is 1I1ess medicalll and is not included in the umbrella term IIbattered child syndrome\" and is therefore easier to ignore; that neglect is far less IIdramaticll and therefore easier to ignore and consider inconsequential; and that provision of services for neg\u00ad lect cases is more expensive, since much neglect results from con\u00ad troversial social issues such as unemployment. One of the sources to which Kadushin had referred in stating that only three books had been published that dealt with neglect was Child Neglect: Understanding and Reaching the Parent (1972), by Norman A. polansky, et ala Polansky was also the author of the HEW report, Child Neglect: State of the Knowledge. These authors state that child abuse and neglect need not go hand-in-hand: We have seen children who are well-:-fed, well-dressed, well\u00ad housed and yet treated cruelly We have seen other children who undergo cold and malnutrition and periodic abandonment, but have never been struck or even physically punished by a' parent. They also mention the problem of definition when dealing with neg\u00ad lect: 1I there is no established yardstick for measuring the point at which child care has sunk so low as to be called neglect.1I The authors see family poverty and ;; infantile;: attitudes ~nd behavior by adults as the most common causes of neglect. These infantile adults are unable to make fine distinctions among their ideas; think concretely and never abstractly; have trouble solv- c::, ing any sort ,of pr\u00b7oblem\"j react in all-or-none terms i' cannot cope with frustration or failure; are inflexible; demand immediate 'grati\u00ad fication of their needs; and have consistently poor judgment about others. The most obvious and consistent characteristic about in\u00ad fantile adults is that they are extremely self-centered \"and care for themselv(=s first and foremost. The authors state that, rather than lovingr; these adults develop IIclingingll relationships. According to a pamphlet published by the Children's Division of the American Humane Association entitled Neglecting Parents: A Study c)f psychosocial Characteristics: The way in which these [neglecting] parents:~,:Cfeal with rea~ity is known to, the caseworker who has carried a'caseload with a high proportion of character disordered clients. The fact that approximi;l.tely31% of the group distorted reality, 22% denied reality and almost 5% were out of touch with reality \"in9icates a real problem for the caseworker. -158-i ' '\" / il\\, distortion seems to be commorl among neglecting par\u00ad ents, allowing them to continue acting inappropriately toward their ~iMr~. ' Breaking the Cycle of Child Abuse, by Christine Herbruck, a grQup sponsor for Parents Anonymous in Cleveland, explores spe\u00ad cific areas of the abuse/neglect spectrum. Herbruck distinguishes between physical neglect, emotional neglect, and emotional abuse, which has been done only rarely. She describes the dynamiCS of physical neglect as follows~ Physical neglect, as its name implies, is exactly that--the neglect of the physical needs of the child. Failure to pro- vide medical attention, proper meals, adequate and appropriate clothing, and routine body care constitutes physical neglect As with all types of abuse, physical neglect is a sign that something is wrong in the parent's life. Physical neglect demon\u00ad strates that for some reason, such as a recent, divorce\" a death, or more complicated personality reasons, the parent is not tak\u00ad ing adequate care of the child. Par,ents who neglect their chil\u00ad dren often neglect their homes as well [N]eglecters are not \"harder\" to treat; rather, they require different treatment. Unlike abusive parents, the energy level of neglecting parents is often so low that for them to get to appointments with their therapists is practically impossible and, therefore, treatment falters at the early point. The therapist may need to make many home visits in the beginning. Frequently, adults who neglect their children are so full of and enervated by their own problems that they have no energy to spare. Typically, the neglecter has very little drive or initiative and lacks both motivation and the desire to follow through~ The adult caught up in a pattern of physical neglect may alternate long periods of sleep with times when he or she s leaps sporadically or not at all. This type 9f person rarely goes out of the house and has few, if any, close friends. Just living seems to be the extent of the coping ability of the adult who physically n~glects. On the subject of e.motional E.,eglect, Herbruck writes: Emotional neglect is the neglect of the emoti9nal needs of the child Emotional neglect differs from emotional abuse in that nothing harmful is actually said or done to the child. In fact, not enough is\u00b7 done, period. a Children 'who have been emotion\u00ad ally neglected seem to grow up with an unclear or vague idea ~f who they are. Many don't perceive themselve~ as being good or bad; they simply don't perceive themselves as being anything :.: at all. ,', Neglect in its most extreme form results in the \"failure\"\"to- thrive\" infant--a baby who both physically and e:motio~ally does not develop normally Babies without adequate stimulation, handling, and love do not thrive. While emotional neglect of any form leads to underd~velopment of some aspect of the child, \u00b7-159-.. 4] ',6;\\ :~ f drome. Failure-to-thrive infants may begin as undemanding babies; even if they don't, they're forced to become that way. When their needs are never met, they stop making them known. They cry seldom or for only brief periods of time because they've learned that nothing happens when they do cry~ Parents brag about what \"very good\" babies these infants are because they never cause any \"trouble.\" A failure-to-thrive infant can grow and change from a listless, thin baby into a fat, lively one in a few weeks in a hospital setting wh1t'~ the attendants re- spond 1:0 his or her needs. I), \\ J \\ , Herbruck's comments about emotiona-'r abuse directly follow these comments about neglect: Emotional abuse is a side effect of every other form of abuse~ It can be administered on its own, however, without the pre\u00ad sence of any of the other types Emotional abuse creates a stifling and crippling atmosphere which is difficult to describe but easy to recognize. It severely damages the child's sense of self. It occurs when an adult uses weapons such as guilt or fear to influence a child1s behavior. Parents who make their children feel so gu,ilty that they can't leave home, for example, or who threaten illness, death, or desertion if their behavior doesn't change are emotional abusers. The flow of words and feelings is often insidious, but the total effect is devastat,\u00ad ing. Although such a parent can and often does use harmful words a~~inst his or her child, it is the force of emotions behind t.he words which hurts the child the most. The child Ts\"l';ft with feelings of in~\\~quacy arid helplessness. We hope we have shown .:that neglect can be just as harmful-\u00ad even more harmful in its long-lasting effects--as abuse. Emotional damage can be as severe for ,the neglected child as for the bat\u00ad tered child, and more seriOUS in its effects on the whole SOCiety. As the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect Us_~r manualq, referred to earlier in this section state, ~ ~ The fate of neglected children concerns all professionals involved in child protection. Their parents have survived to adulthood, but it is often uncertain whether the children will. Should these children escape premat:ure death, and fortunately most survive, they run a chance o,f being physically handicapped. That they will be psychologically crip\u00ad pled, however, is more than a chance; it is ''1 probab.ility~ Society does not know everyth:LTlg there is to know about develop\u00ad ing happy, compet:.ent people; however, in the l~st century so\u00ad ciety has learned that people with good biological potential may, nevertheless, become intel .. lectually stunted and burdened by emotions that include anger, anxiety and intense loneliness. It does not require extraordinary sensitivity to feel badly for others whose chances at happiness are wasted. How does -160-l f , I I I SOCiety benefit when children survive phYSically-only to be SOCially and emotionally damaged? Nor it is possible to turn away fro~ the parents of these children, for they did not choose to be th~s way. And, besides, thes~ fam~lies are members of society. They affect everyone. Along w~th p~ty, society is experiencing a riSing sense of alarm. There is now evidence that children who have been maltreated, especially neglected, are more likely than others t~ be d:linquent; moreover, their crimes are more likely to be cr~es or personal violence. These families also consume common resources without contributing proportionately to their renewal: In a time of declining American affluence, everyone shares,~ the burden of the unproductive. Legislation aimed at soc~al control applies to all, but it appears particularly relevant to people unwilling or unable to instill workable con\u00ad sciences in their children. Social reactions, such as holding pa::ents personally responsibl~~ !for thefts and assaults by their understandable~ CPS workers and other profes\u00ad s~onals, ~ human only hope that such reac'\u00ad t~ons w~ll pr~ve ewo-supportive rather than merely punitive for parents w~th ~~om they are involved. 3. Adolescent Abuse a~d Neglect b Abuse and neglect of teenagers~re Similar in many ways to a use c:-nd neglect of younger childrem, yet there are some impor\u00ad tant d~~fer~nces. Adolescent Abuse Ne lect: Intervention ~trateg~e~ ~s a manua pu ~s e in January, 9 0 as one in a ser\u00ad ~es from the Office of Human Development in Washington It st that there is a problem in identifying adolescent Victims of a~~~:es at;-d t;-eglect,because these children do not resemble the \"typical\" :~ctli11s. They ar~ usually 1.2 to 18 years-IJ.,ld and are often big, trong, ~nd generally healthy. The manual presents statistics that_ show that actual abuse--often very serious-~is quite common a~ons.,~ adolescents and is an area often overlooked by SOCial ser\u00ad v~~e agency personnel. Furthermore, abuse and neglect among these c ~ldren tend to recur w~th.a greater frequency than do abuse and ne~lect among younger ch~ldren. A good deal ,of adolescent abuse c:-r~s~s, as a result of emerg,tng sexuality in children, particularly ~n g~l::ls, a~d as a result of feelings of independence developed naturally by adolescents. The manual stresses that adolescent neglect cases outnumber abuse cases almost two to one. The following excerpt from the manual deals with neglect: Neglectful families' lives are chaotic and disordered- diffi\u00ad culty in coping is apt to be generalized rather than iimited to chil~-r7aring.c Parents frequently play the role of the older ~J.bhng rather than parent to their c.hildren, and com\u00ad pete wJ.th them over whose dependency needs will be Wet Neg-lected adolescents: \\\\ -161-'I \u00b7~ t ,~. I 1) 2) 3) 4) usually approach the tasks of adolescent development with generalized developmental lags and evidence of behavior disorders and/or withdrawal; m~y be quite aggresive and exhibit antisocial behavior; often have problems with internalization of controls; may appear emotionally healthy, but may have psychosocial and cultural deficiencies that may eventually bring them to the attention of schools, hospitals, and mental health facilities; 5) may be at extremely high risk for early pregnancy; and 6) may exhibit extreme withdrawal and suicide gestures in very s.erious cases. The manual distinguishes between neglect originating in child\u00ad ho~d and neglect beginning when children become adolescents. When ~h~~dren are neglected only when they reach their teens, often ~t ~s because the parents give up their responsibilities because they fee~ that th~y no longer can control their children, parti\u00ad cularly l.f the ch~ldren \"testll their parents excessively. It may also be because parents often take on new responsibilities them\u00ad ~elves, such as new jobs and returning to school once their chil\u00ad dren are ~raisedll and the parents feel that they'can fend for them\u00ad selves fa~rl~ well. In these cases, the children in the home are leftovers from the 1I0id life.\" Because of the problems presented by adolescents, the manual suggests that CPS designate one or more specialized,adolescent caseworkers to ha~dl~ cases involving adolescent abuse and neg\u00ad lect. ~hese spec~al~sts would be able to rec?gnize the indicators of abusJ.ve or neglectful behaviOl:'. The manual says that behavior may be the only clue to abuse or neglect. A specialized CPS worker could then desig~ an individua+. service plan for each child. . One of the strongest pOints stressed in the manual is that 1nter-agency cooperation is essential to treatment of adolescents-\u00ad and any other abused or neglected population, for that matter. In fact, the manual addresses the very issue of distrust among personnel assigned to or working on a case. 40 The Conflict Between Children's and Parents' Rights Cases of abused and neglecte'd teenagers often raise the issue pf the child's rights vs. the parents' rights. Adolescents often assert their emerging independence, forcing courts and child wel\u00ad fare agencies to confront the issue of the adolescents' rights as young adults~ One must bear in mind that this subject applies t~ all abused and neglected children, including the younger vic\u00ad t1ffiS who are unable to assert their rights on their own. -162-r I, I j! fI ij it \" i\" I t '. i ',' ( 1 !

I' I I Commission staff reviewed a series of three articles concerned with foster care, adoption, and the concept we mentioned briefly before of IIpermanent foster. care. II All of these i~sues a~e perti\u00ad nent to our discussion, particularly the final opt~on, wh~ch seems to be the newest and most radical suggestion for alternative care for abused and neglected children. The three articles are a~l by Andre P. Derdeyn, a psychiatrist ,with ,the Div~s,i(:m ,of Ch~ld and Adolescent Psychiatry of the Un~vers~ty of V~rg~n~a Med~~al Center. The first article was co-authored by Walter J. Wadl~ngton III and published as IIAdoption: The Rights of Parents ';. the Best Interests of Their Childrenll in the Journal of the Amer~can Aca\u00ad demy of Child Psychiatr~ (1977). A summary from the article's abstract makes clear. its focus: Adoption for the benefit of children is a relatively recent historical development which continues to be influenced by the concept of children as the property of their biological par\u00ad ents. Substantial changes in current practices can occur pri\u00ad marily through new legislation stipulating that the interests of the children are to be at least equal to the rights of their parents. Previously, of course, the rights of parents superceded by far the best interests of the child. The authors refer to several court decisions in their discus\u00ad sion of the adoption issue. One 1972 case included a statement by a judge that the natural mother has an lIunqualified right to withdraw consent to adopt. II Another states that the burden rests no't upon the natural mother to show 'that a child I s welfare would be enhanced by the child's being returned, but rather by the non\u00ad parents to prove that the mother is unfit and that the child's well-being requires separation from the mother. The authors cO.mment that the presumption t~at ~ child s~ould always stay with his natural parents serves to avo~d a cons~dera\u00ad tion of what actually would best serve the child's'interests.1I They cite a 1972 court decision that determined that the welfare of the child is not a controlling factor in adoption cases: They add, IIGeneraliy, it is only after the righ~s of the biolog~cal parents are so terminated that the court w~ll assess a proppsed adoption according to whether .it promotes the child's best inter\u00ad ests. II They make it clear that when a naturw-~ pa~en~ c,?ntests _ .' an adoption proceeding, the welfare of the ch~ld 1S qUl.te second aryll to the interests of the parent.. Courts' are very reluctant to terminate parental rights. The authors also allege that,when the courts do terminate parental rights, it is often to pun~sh, the parents for previous extreme behavior, not to place the ch~ld in the best possibl~ situation. The authors recommend a change in legislation,to provide ~ore detailed and clearer criteria for the decision-mak~ng process ~n adoption cases. They recommend a specific statutory provision that the best interests of the child be weighed at least equally with the rights of the biological parents. Their conclusion also is useful: \",,163---~ ----~'--~~--------------~ ---------- The most important impediment to the court's response to the child's needs is a preoccupation with the concept that biolo\u00ad gical parents have something closely akin to a legal property right in their children. Because of the lack of legal tradi\u00ad tion regarding adoption in the English common law, adoption in this country is always statutory and the statutes are com\u00ad prehensive and detailed. Any major change in adoption prac\u00ad tices requires a change in the laws. Der.deyn published another article 'entitled \"Child Abuse and Neglect: The Rights of Pa~ents and the Needs of Their Children\" in the American Journal of Orthopsychiatry (1977). In this arti\u00ad cle, Derdeyn mentions that most authors and researchers have held that state intervention in family affairs should be kept to a mini\u00ad mum and that children, not be removed from their homes until ex\u00ad tensive efforts have been made to rehabilitate the natural par\u00ad ents and the home situation. He mentions that state responsibility for such rehabilitation has grown and has been \"formalized\" by the idea that statutes providing for termination of parental rights include a \"familial right to treatment\" clause or philosophy. Derdeyn mentions what were at that time recent New York court opinions requiring two findings in order for parental rights to be terminated: a fIiiding of \"permanent neglect,\" and a finding that the responsible agency IImust have not failed in its duty to encourage and strengthen the relationship between mother and child.\" Derdeyn goes on to point out that right now,,';,the most \"hotly contested court involvement\" occurs at the time parental rights may be terminated. Instead of this being the critical moment, he feels that the initial deciSion to remove a child from his hOlne should be the most critical decision in the matter. He says that the burden should rest on the state to prove that removal is ab\u00ad solutely ne,cessary for the well-being of the child. He continues' ~ ~he truly momentous decision is the removal of the child from the home in the first place, and this juncture needs to be re\u00ad cognized as the critical moment it is for the child, the fam\u00ad ily, the agency, and for the decision-making process itself. [The court] is in many ways not faced with what appears to be a momentous problem: the parents are not currently abusing or neglecting their child, and the child is apparently being adequately cared for in foster placement. A frequent response of the court is to find that termination of parental rights is not warranted, but that the child requires continued foster care. It is at the time of removal that the weight of parental rights should be exerted, in order to allow, the parents to keep their child if the state cannot establish that they cannot care for their child adequately. Once the child is removed the burden should shift to the par\u00ad ent or parents tp establish that their rights should not be terminated or thqt they are capable of caring for the child. -164-I t I ~ r I ,~ So Derdeyn has proposed that, instead of placing children in f~s\u00ad ter care and then, after the sense of urgency has passed, leav~ng them there unadopted because of the issue of parental rights, par\u00ad ents' rights should be asserted strongly when removal is first contemplated. If the child is placed in foster care, then the parents should have to prove their right to the child. Derdeyn's somewhat ge~eral discussion is co~tinued,in the _ next issue of the American Journal of Orthopsych~atry, ~n an ar ticle entitled \"A Case for Permanent Foster Placement of Depend\u00ad ent Neglected and Abused Children.\" BaSically, his position is that a good'compromise between long-term foster placement with\u00ad out the severance of parental rights and adoption would be what he calls \"permanent\" foster care. The difference between this type of foster care, \"normal\" foster care, and adoption, is that while parental rights are not severed, parents would be,u~able , to regain custody. Thus, they still would be able to v~s~t the~r children placed in this type of care. Derdeyn states ~hat ~hiS situatidh might be better for the child when the relat~onsh~p b~\u00ad tween the child and his foster parents is better than the relat~on\u00ad ship between the child and his natural parents, but when, for what\u00ad ever reasons, parental rights could not be terminated. Derdeyn's description of this type \"of care follows: Permanent foster placement should be considered in tho~,e situ\u00ad ations where strong emotional bonds have developed between fos\u00ad ter parents and foster child. Such a legal arrangement would ensure the stability and continuity of the foster parent-foster child relationship. In addition to serving families where there is an established good relationship between foster parents and foster,\"Child, permanent foster care would be applicable to some unad6ptable children. Children currently in long-term foster care for whom adoption is of diminishing likelihood are those who are older, of minority race, or suffering from some handi\u00ad cap. Others are not free for adoption due to agency inertia or judicial maintenance of parental rights. In addition, some children conti..Tlue to have important emotional ties to biologi\u00ad cal parents who can never take care of them, and the termina\u00ad tion of the relationship with biological parents required by adoption woul(i ,be undesirable for them. <'C. \\' We have presented this option to adoption because it has had some consideration not only in the child abuse literature but among some soc,i,al ~ervice agenc ies, according to Derdeyn. Al!30, probably Derdeyn is very aware that this situation exists in ~ facto form in some stat'es anyway. Many children do languis~ ~I1 a single foster placement with no termination of pa~ental r~ghts. These children are luckier than children who are sh~fted from,home to home, but, they still face the problem of not really belong~ng to arly one person or family. Derdeyn I s sol~tion appears to b~ meant to remedy a situation tha,t already ex~sts and that he v~ews as unfortunate, at best. Derdeyn's final comments on this issue follow: -165- It is apparent that the parental right issue is and will re\u00ad maiU a major block to adoption. When a dispute between a bio\u00ad logical parent and a third party involves termination of par\u00ad ental rights preparatory to adoption, parental right is very often the determining factor. If parental rights are not di\u00ad rectly confronted by means of an attempt to terminate those rights, however, custody may be determined by what the court decides is best for the child's welfare. The weakness of this arrangement with regard to continuity of the child's relation\u00ad ship with the foster parents is that the biological parents may continue to challenge the foster parents' custody of the child. with the advent of increased rights of foster parents, it appears possible that in certain ~ircumstances, the foster pal)'ents' right to custody might be made a permanent one. The major reason Derdeyn proposes this plan, of course, is that it could be a way to \"beat\" the courts' reluctance to termi\u00ad nate parental rights. His argument that this type of care may be better thad adoption because the natural parents still have visitation rights is flawed; many children would be more harmed than helped if suhjected to having to understand and deal with two sets of \"parents.\" It seems likely that judges would be no more amenable to using permanent foster care bec:ause use of such care theoretically severs permanently any possibility that the natural parents could regain custody. Judges are affected in their decision not only by emotional bonds between the, biological par\u00ad ents and their children, but also by the, possibility that the par\u00ad ents may be able to rehabilitate, regain custody, and reconsti\u00ad tute a \"normal\" family. Permanent foster care does little to ad\u00ad dress these concerns on the part of a judge. So th~ argument that the natural parents be able to visit' their children seems to be shal.low as the rationale setting up such a problematiC system. Permanent placement as defined by Derdeyn would be legal in this state, however. If DCFS maintained legal guardianship over a child, it could initiate permanent placement under the law and still maintain control of parental rights of visitation. Kris Olmstead and Bruce Rubenstein, both from DCFS, told us that the Department does place children in what is called \"long term foster care.\" This concept approaches the permanent, place\u00ad ment concept with no legal designation or determination as pro\u00ad posed by Derdeyn. Both told us that DCFS does not place children in foster\" care with the purpose that they be adopted. Department philosophy is that the natural parents should be provided support and time to rehabilitate so that they can regain custody of their children and resume normal family life. However, as a matter of practicality and humanity, if a child in foster care becomes avail\u00ad able for adoption, the foster parents are often given the first opportunity to adopt. In some cases the foster parents are chosen partially because gf their interest in adoption and their ability to move from being foster ,to adoptive parents. Finally, the fos\u00ad ter parents are usually chosen if the emotional bond between them -166-! I, , I !

Bruce Rubenstein told us that the basic premise of foster care and the premise of permanent placement contradict one another Rubenstein was totally opposed to Derdeyn's proposed plan. Olmstead told us that such a plan with older children (over 10) might actu\u00ad ally be in the best interest of the child. She told us that it might be feasible to recruit foster parents especially for perma\u00ad nent placement care, but more likely it would be used with an exist\u00ad in~ foster relationship,in which the need for security for the c~l.ld could not be obt~lJ.ned, for whatever reason, through adop\u00ad tl.on. She offered the examole of an eight-year-old child who had been in foster care for three years. If this chtld had only one natural parent living who was sentenced to 20 years in prison, permanent placement would offer both the child and the foster fam\u00ad ily the permanency they would require if the parent refused' to surrender parental rights. We were told that one of the key factors to this plan was the emotional investments made by both natural and foster parents. If a natural parent agreed, visitation could be arranged much as it occurs in a divorce proceeding, and if the child were old enough the child could partiCipate in the formulation of a visitation ' schedule., However, if permanent placement were entered into with\u00ad out some agreement on the part of the natural parents, it would be likely either that the natural parent would cease visitation or that the natural parent would. utilize visitation rights to con\u00ad tinually threaten the placement. Pertinent to the issue of permanent placement is a new ini\u00ad tiative by DCFS called permanency pl~nning~ Though the Pep~rtment has planned for long-term care for its wards for years, the Depart\u00ad ment is now going about it in a more directed fashion. The DCFS publication Hotline reported in its Winter, 1981-82 issue that almost 1,200 children went through a new case review system that is intended to assure permanent planning for DCFS wards by the end of October, 1981, the second full month of the new case re\u00ad view system. The system is mandated by a recent amendment to the DCfS enabling act, discussed in our chapter on legal issues. DCFS Director Gregory L. Coler said that the new system was \"inspired in partll by federal law that requires case planning and review \"as an absolute condition for federal reimbursement.1I Coler is quoted in this publication as saying: ' No longer will kids be permitted to drift in foster care while the state shells out more and more money for clothing, room, and board with little concern for either the child's psyche or his.future. In this age of unprecedented demand on declining federal re\u00ad sources, we ~ill also be getting the most efficient us~ of our funds. -167-we will conclude our presentation of arguments about the rights of children and parents and the issue of adoptive and related care with several references to one of the most Popular books recently published on the subject of child care. Before the Best Interest~ of the Child, by Joseph Goldstein, Anna Freud, and Alber~ J. Soln~t (1979), begins with the premi~e th~t a f':1mi~* structure (but not necessarily either legal or b~olog~~al) lS~ e be~t structure-r0r rearing children, and that dissolut~on of the fam~ly should occur only in limited and narrowly defined circumstances. Any effec\u00ad tive intervention program must be minimal and must create or re\u00ad create as quickly as possible a stable family for the child in\u00ad volved. A child's psychological need for family should override al\u00ad most all other concerns, and the state, according to the authors, never should be more than a temporary caretaker. The authors state that families have three basic rights: parental autonomy to make decisions for the child\u00b7 a child's right to \"autonomous parents\"; and a privacy f~om inte~vention. They elaborate that ~ child has the right to a family unit that corresponds to a child ~ sen~e of continuity and structure. This family need not be,b~olo~~cal but may be constituted in one of several other ways, ~nclud~ng foster care. The authors say tha't the state should intervene only in the following circumstances: .' when parents request that the st~te t~ke the child from their custody; when the caretaker of the ch~ld e~ther requests adoption or refuses to surrender the C~ild to natural parents; when the child's parent or caretaker d~es and no ~ther arrangement has been made for the child; when paren~s phys~call! abuse or neglect the child; when parents refuse med~cal treatment that is lifesaving and non-experimental; and when pa~~~ts request legal assistance or an adjudication is made that a cnild needs ., legal assistance. The authors present a proposal even more lenient than those recently enacted into Illinois law. Unde'r their proposal, foster families may request and be granted adoption of any child under three years of age that they have had for more than one ye?lr a:r:d any child over three that they ha.ve had\",for two years. The or ~\u00ad ginal parent then surrenders parental rights and the ,only poss~ble objection to prevent adoption would corne from the ch~ld. The recurring theme in this book is mini~al intervention by the state, together with a demonstrated value in the best inter\u00ad ests of the child. 5. Prevention Efforts 'I'he Herbruck volu~efcited earlier (Breaking the Cycle of Child Abuse) states, \"N'iiiety percent of all abus~ve nomes can be made safe; some of the parents may never have all of the,patience or good humor pOSSible, but their homes can be made emot~onally and physically secure for their children. II -168-, . .... . it ~ I I I I I l' >l! II ~ ~ II ! ! [~ 1 'j J I , l ~ j One of the key iSsues in current thought about child abuse and neglect, however, concerns prevention. ObviOUSly, we would pref7r to prevent abuse than to have to treat it. One expert in the ~mportant area of prevention is Gertrude J. Williams, whose 1980 article \"Toward'the Eradication of Child Abuse and Neglect at Horne\" was reviewed by CommiSSion staff. Williams pOints out that the Child Abuse Prevention and Treat\u00ad ment AC~ specifies that prevention of abuse is a major goal; she also po~nts out that prevention has received \"miniscule attention in child abuse and neglect programs ...... She cites data from fed\u00ad eral studies that indicate that child abuse treatment programs ge~erally seem to work at about 50% effectiveness. She indicates tha\\t-one of the problems with these, programs may be their general assprnption that the abused child should be returned home in the Va}3!!t majority of cases. She is adamant in her rej\"ection of such ideas: It cannot be assumed that a child has formed a bond with an abusive or neglectful mother Furthermore an abused child's wish to remain or ~eturn to the mother may stem from a maso\u00ad chistic rather than a growth-enhancing attachment. In such a case, a child's attachment to an abusive or neglectful mother may be more damaging than the effects of separation.. . Williams favors freeing children for adoption as S00l1i~~S pos\u00ad sible when the case clearly warrants separation between parent and child. Williams attacks the lack of family planning and abortion counseling as causative of a good deal of abuse and neglect.~_Her critiCisms also carryover to .. other areas of American life, iri~ .. eluding a nurr.ber of \"textbook myths!! about roles members of our SOCiety must play Williams recommends the development of programs whose pUr\u00ad pose is to find alternatives to keeping a child and parent together. She describes these efforts as alternatives to what we now have and titles them \"child~oriented programs.\" She speaks of \"socially sanctioned violence against children\": The eradication of child abuse cannot be accomplished if the attitude persis.ts that corporal punishment of children is a right of parents [and teachers). ',,\" Corporal punishment is not a nec,!=ssity ~\"'th~ teaching of chil- dren. It has been abOlished in schools in Denmark, Finland, Holland, Israel, Japan, Norway, the Soviet Union, and Sweden. Finally', she cites fourteen separate sources who \"have empha\u00ad sized the ineffectivene~s and irrationality of the corporal punish\u00ad ment of children and have s~'ggested effective, growth-inducing, nonviolent alternatives to disciplining and instructing children.\" -169- \" These fina~ findings are also reflected in a document record- lng the proceedlngs ~f the National Conference of Representatives from Government, Medla, and the Academic Community, sponsored November 20-21, 1978, by the Annenberg School of Communications of the University of Pennsylvania and the Bush Center of Child Develop~ent and Social Policy, Yale University. The proceedings are entltled CCimference Recommendations on Child Abuse: Report of ~epresentatlves\" from Government, Media, and the ACademj~c Com\u00ad munlty and were edlted by Catherine J o. Ross and others. Theodocu\u00ad ment reports that all representatives at the Conference cond~mned corporal punishment in the scllqols even though, at that time, only fo~r\"sta~es banned corporal punishment. Specific suggestions for ellIDlnatlng corporal punishment from schools included \"~ passage of state and federal legislation or administrative regulations p~ohibiting it, monitoring of schools by parents, government agen\u00ad cles, and advocacy groups, and trainin teachers in alternative methods of discipline and classroom managemeE!\" emp elrs). One of the appendixes of this document includes a number of specific recommendations for the prevention and treatment of child abuse and neglect. Several will be paraphrased here: 1) 2) 3) 5) 6) ,~ ) separate definitions should be developed for terms in\u00ad cluding lIabusell and \"neglectll fO:r:: the separate purposes of legal, research, clinical, and social service func\u00adtions.

II Volunteers could playa crucial role in this step. IIContinuing research and evaluation are needed to test the effectiveness of various approaches and programs and to improve O'ur understanding of what causes child abuse.\" Public interest groups should meet with media representa\u00ad tives to develop media campaigns emphasizing prevention. Television should also donate time during prime time for commercial messages. -170-j r' r I ! ~ .. ! 1 II Ii !~ \". I I' j i ; ! I;. I ~ I i t 'f ' ......

II These parents often have such psychological and social Charac\u00ad teristics as a sense of incompetence and poor self-esteem, great difficulty in seeking and finding pleasure in the adult world, social isolation, a strong belief in the value of punishment, a family history of abuse and a serious lack of ability to empa\u00ad thize with a child I s condition and needs . These characteristics manifest themselves in visible danger signals--problem drinking, repeated job loss, unwanted pregnan\u00ad cies at a young age, poor utilization of medical care, birth cGmplioatiGns. Q~r~~listic expectatiGns of their children and an inability to maintain children on various behavior and school schedules--that can be spotted by trained professionals as possible precursors to physical or emotional abuse. 6. Self-Help Groups and Voluntarism Closely rela~ed to efforts at prevention are self-help groups. Parents Anonymous was established in California in 1970 as a na\u00ad tional self-help organization. By 1974, the national group had 90 chapters in the United States and Canada and it has grown tre\u00ad mendously since then. Parents Anonymous is, baSically, a crisis\u00ad intervention program whose primary objective is helping to pre\u00ad vent \"damaging relationships\" between parents and their children!' According to Cassie L. Starkweather and Michael S. Turner, authors of an article entitled \"Parents Anonymous: Reflections on 'the Development of a Self-Help Gi~\"OUp\" (in Nancy Ebeling and Deborah Hill's book Child Abuse: Intervention and Treatment [1975]), the primary appeal of., Parents Anonymous lies in two general a';~'::'lis: the inadequacy of present methods of responding to abusive pai.\"ia,nts in anything other than \"moral or punitivell t'erms, and \"openne;3Ic: -171-JI j r r ,) (t \\ d \\ ,I ,::) (.I ). t pa gi ;p ~ ~ ~ CF and honesty among members, their easy accessibility during crises and their feeling of urgency in finding concrete 'do it now' ap\u00ad proaches to dealing with their problems. II Interestingly enough, members of Parents Anonymous often ex\u00ad press fears of seeking help from professionals because they per\u00ad ceive large differences in education, sex, and social status, which can become communication and understanding barriers. Man.y members indicated that the kinds of relationships that they can establish with other parents through the organization form a sharp contrast to this fear and expectation. The authors also note tha.t many times this fear of professionals serves as a smokescreen for \"a parent's difficulty in admitting the problem to himself. II The founder of Parents Anonymous of New York, Gertrude M. Bacon (a former Family Court judge), in a 1977 article published in Victimology, describes the group as follows: Parents Anonymous is a self-help group of parents who offer immediate relief to parents who feel they are abusing or neg\u00ad lecting their children. We offer a 24 hour telephone service in the U.s .. Our basic concept is parents helping each other to help themselves, by continuous communication through the phone and meetings, to change our habits on a day to day basis. Parents Anonymous is a non-profit group, completely autonomous, with no agency affiliation. All services are free. Our ba.sic rules of privacy and confidentiality are strictly followed Our primary objective is the rehabilitation of damaged rela\u00ad tionships be'tween parents and children, by instilling within the parents the strength and self-confidence to rechannel our destructive attitudes and actions into constructive ones by changing our habits on a daily basiS. Bacon goes on to make the point that one of the major reasons that Parents Anonymous is not ever agency-affiliated is so that the parents involved in 'tne-group will come to help themselves and will realize that whatever good results occur have been as a re\u00ad sult of their own good efforts. She adds that too often members of society refuse to recognize a child abuser as another human being; even well-intentioned outside organizations may have pre\u00ad judices against the members or the methoqs of the group. Bacon presents ten ideas that parents who may be on the verge of abusing their children should consider: 1) 2) The first step to handling anger toward children is ac\u00ad cepting the'fact that their feelings are IIhonest, human, and universal fee~ings.\" . Parents must learn to handle their anger without damag\u00ad ing their children .\" 3} Parents should learn not to .create situations that will make them angry unnecessarily. -172-, r {-:-. \" \" I~ i .~. I , 4) 5) 6) 7) 8) \"A child lives what he learns,\" which parents should remem\u00ad ber before applying disciplinary measures. Often children are not the cause of a parent's anger. The most important thing about Parents Anonymous is that if offers someone to talk to. \"Children who tend to ignore high-decibel commands will often respond to a quiet request for understanding or cooperation ... Being a good parent does not mean never yelling at a child; it means spanking only appropriately, after a child has been warned and understands the consequences of his ac\u00ad tions. 9) A good test of whether a parent should yell or spank his children is whether it is working; overdoing either usu\u00ad ally means that it has no positive effect anymore. ., 10) \"[T] ry to change your child by changing yourself. The way to change is little by little, day by day.\" A 1978 publication by Isolde Chapi.n, \"Childre~ Are for.Loving: volunteer Involvement in the Treatment and Prevent10n of Ch1ld Abuse and Neglect,\" maintains that volunteers can help both abused children and their parents. The author states that volunteers can help both abused chil\u00ad dren and their parents. This may be especially pertinent given reduction of social service funding at the federal and state level. Commission staff members have attended conferences--since announce\u00ad ment of federal Qudget cuts--in which the volunteer issue was pre\u00ad sented as extremely important precisely because of the proposed and expected cuts in social service dollars. Chapin sta~es that volunteers can provide crisiS intervention and the teach1ng of parenting~ She stresses that child abuse is occurring every day everywhere and that volunteers are needed to address the prob17m. One of the most effective groups of volunteers are former abus1ve parents themselves~ volunteers can be used to assist as parent aides, to provide parent education, information, and referral services, to provide temporary homes and adolescent counseling, and to act as advocates in juvenile court. Another in the series of User manuals published by tiona.! Center on Child Abuse 'and Neglect, which we have to earlier, is entitled Parent Aides in Child Abuse and Programs, by Carla D. G i '. or an C! ers. . e manua. 0 vice concerning situations appropr1ate for 1ntervent10n by parent aides. Situations in which such paren1;: aides should ~ be used -173-\u00a3Q 4;; '$0 I i. include when parents have sexually abused a child, when parents are also involved in spouse abuse, when parents are alcoholic or addicted to drugs, and when parents have severe emotional prob- lems, such as psychosiS. The manual states that CPS workers should sUBervise the work of parent aides through biweekly telephone calls. These CPS work\u00ad ers must be on-call 24 hours a day for crisis intervention and lnust be willing to incorporate information regarding parent aide involvement with the family in the official case file~ According to this manual, parent aides must spend at least four hours each week with the parent (and make additional phone calls), encourage the parent to take part in community-based so\u00adcial and educational groupS, help out with transportation of chil\u00ad dren to and from school and to and from such things as medical appointments, help out in activities with the parents such as shop\u00ad ping and picnicking, and provide guidance in such areas as budget- ing and helping with child care needs. The manual also lists things that parent aides should avoid doing. The list includes becoming too emotionally involved with the situation; becoming overly involved with the child (in fact, the manual recommends that parent aides not become involved with the child ;.'I.t all unless supported in these efforts by the parents); discussing ,\"the abusive or neglectful situation directly with the parents unless the parents initiate the discussion; and accusing a parent of being a \"bad\" parent. Obviously, the emphasis is on constructive help, not criticisms of the parents or attempts to work with the children. However, the manual stresses that if par\u00ad ent aides become aware of further abusive or neglectful behavior on the part of the parents, the behavior must be reported to the CPS worker. CPS workers also must be ab'le to ask the parent aides to assist in the assessment .0+ potential harm to a child. The manual states that, if necessary, parent aides can testify in court on behalf of the parents but that they should not be utilized to testify against the parents. This manual mentions that the parent aide/parent relation\u00ad ship should be terminated when the aide, the CPS worker, and the parent aide program director all agree that the client should be able to depend on his/her own resources. Contact between the aide and the parent should decrease gradually, and the parent should be informed that contact can be reinitiated should she need it. A number of specifiC exercises and steps toward training for po- tential parent aides are also provided. -174-! \\ I Chapter 5 CASE STUDIES: CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT RESULTING IN DEATH For Fiscal Years 1977 1978 child abuse deaths numbered 53 7 1979 and 1980, reported cases reliability of these state-wid~ t~t 57',and 101! respectively. because they were compiled pr' t als 1S quest1onable, however Abused and Neglected Child R 10r .0 the major amendments to the' made effective in 1980. eport1ng Act which were enacted and Prior to FY 81, the eight DCFS ' , report all child abuse deaths to S :eg1?nS d1d not necessarily of The reports not collected centr 11 pr1ngf1eld.

A. Tracy This case occurred in Ch' mqnth-otd Tracy. 1cago, and involves the death of 18- -175-; U Q;g ... - On April 18, 1979, the principal of an elementary school in Chicago reported a case of suspected child abuse to the Chicago Police Department. A six-year-old boy named Michael, who was Tracy's brother, had come to school that morning with lacerations on his arms, legs, and other parts of his body. Initially, he told the principal he had been cut by falling down, but he changed his story and said that his father had whipped him. (The \"father\"-\u00ad not the natural father but a boyfriend of Michael's and Tracy's mother--Iater was to admit he had hit Michael with a belt that morning before school but that the cuts had occurred in a fall.) Michael was hospitalized and a DCFS worker notified. DCFS, after investigating the incident, entered into an agreement with Michael's and Tracy's mother in which she agreed to undergo coun\u00ad seling if Michael were allowed to return home from the hospital. The boyfriend, James Brown, was arrested by Chicago Police Depart\u00ad ment officers and charged with battery. After being convicted, he was sentenced to six months' court supervision. On June 7, 1979, Chicago police responded to a call at Cook County Hospital. Michael's and Tracy's aunt, a 15-year-old who was then living in their household, was admitted with bruises and lacerations over her entire body, possible internal injuries, and some of her teeth knocked out. She told police she had been at\u00ad tacked by an unknown male as she was walking home (to her sister's house) On June 11, 1979, Chicago police responded to a call at St. Bernard Hospital. Tracy had been admitted for treatment of blows to the head. Tracy also had numerous c~ts and bruises elsewhere on her body. Police questioned the mother, who, although initially denying it, admitted that her boyfriend, James Brown, 'had beaten the child. The mother also told police that Brown had beaten her sister with a skillet, knife and metal bar, which resulted in her hospitalization. After presentation of testimony to a grand jury, Brown was indicted on charges of aggravated battery and armed vio\u00ad lence in connection with all of these incidents. On June 13, 1979, Tracy died of her,injuries. Brown was then indicted for murder. A \"purchase of service\" worker in DCFS' west Area Office, who was primarily a liaison between DCFS and private service pro\u00ad viders, was interviewed by us. She had been assigned this case following CPS' placement of the two children (Michael and his aunt) remaining in the home after Tracy's death. They were both placed in foster care through the Children's Home and Aid Society (CRAS). The DCFS worker told us that she worked with CHAS workers to de\u00ad velop a plan for the children but was not supposed to provide di\u00ad rect service herself. She told us that although it is DCFS procedure, it is not ~ very common for the various workers assigned to a cas,e to sit down together to develop a unified plan. The DCFS family caseworker is kept abrea9t of developments by the DCFS liaison worker's for- -176-[ I r warding of reports from any private agency involved. She added that before private placement is used, a fairly well-developed plan is created. As of the time of our interview, the Department had custody of the children and was going to ask the court for guardianship. At that time, the mother was not pleased with CHAS and the liaison worker was trying to develop alternative counsel\u00ad ing plans. Our investigator spoke with a DCFS multi-service worker as\u00ad signed to the case. His role in the case was limited. As the' multi-service worker to whom the family was assigned, he would normally work with the family to help them resolve their problems. In this case, however, because the two children were in private placement, he was working only with the mother. The multi-service worker's major job was to find and coor\u00ad dinate counseling for the mother. He mentioned that if the chil\u00ad dren had been placed in foster care directly by the Department, and not through CHAS, then he would have their files and be re\u00ad sponsible for provision of services to them as well. This worker confirmed that coordination of efforts between himself and CHAS was primarily through phone contacts and written correspondence. He said that he had never spoken to the liaison worker for DCFS. He admitted that DCFS procedure calls for all parties to get together when a case is opened to determine mutu\u00ad ally beneficial goals, but he added that heavy caseloads frequently prevent that from happening. His caseload at that time was 40 families, totalling about 80 individuals receiving care. The worker told us that unless a child could be placed for adoption, or unless counseling efforts could change the parenting skills of a parent, a child was forever doomed to remain in fos\u00ad ter care. About the only other viable alternative was placement of the child with a relative, though that too was still techni\u00ad cally foster placement. Our review of the DCFS case files on Michael and his aunt revealed that both case, ftles are almost exact duplicates of one another; in fact, one file contained the original of a social in\u00ad vestigation and the other file contained a carbon copy of the same social investigation. Neither file had any information on the medical or educational condition of the two children, even though DCFS had been maintaining the files since June 12, 1979. In fact, the most recent documents in the case files were the case trans\u00ad fer summaries, dated October 11, 1979, which indicated foster placement of Michael and his aunte There was nothing in either file from CHAS or the specific foster homes, nor were there any summaries f~om any DCFS workers on the service provided these children or the mother. Though both files indicated that DCFS obtained temporary custody of the children on June 12, 1979, there was no copy of any cour~ order in either file. Each .file contains a 3D-day review form with planning objec\u00ad tives. Neither was an original; both were copies that failed to -177-.. distinguish separate geals fer the two. children, in spite ef the range in age ef the ch.ildren being placed. No. recerd indicated which, if any, ef the geals had been ebtained~ and the mest re\u00ad cent date fer any ebjective to. be reached was January, 1980. The case transfer summary mentiens the hespitalizatien of Tracy. It indicates that when she was brought to. the hespital fer 'treatment, she was uncenscious and barely breathing. She also. had burn scars and eld bruises en beth arms, Cigarette burns and eld puncture weunds en the bettems ef beth feet, and scratch marks en her face and bedy. The recemmendatiens fer future service fer the two. children include centinued fester placement; individual therapy fer the mether after the birth ef her new baby (she was pregnant at the time). The summary notes the fellewing: \"This is a prier- ity as has a chrenic pattern ef invelvement with vie lent men; and abuse to. any child in her care is likely until this pat\u00ad tern changes.\" In erder to. determine the type ef treatment being effered to. this family, the casewerker frem the Fester Care Divisien ef CHAS who. had been aSSigned to. this case was interviewed. The werker acknewledged that there had been seme centact with the DCFS casewerker, but there had been no. meetings to. previde plan\u00ad ning. He said that he had \"minimal\" centact with the DCFS liai\u00ad sen werker. The private agency werker said that it is the exceptien when he wj.ll be called upen by a DCFS casewerker to. arrange a planning meeting er even to. inquire abeut a given child's pregress in place\u00ad ment. As a result, he said, the private agency casewerker pre\u00ad vides all the care and menitering. The werker teld us he had ceunseled the mOther, but she be\u00ad gem to. View him as an antagenis't and discentinued appeintments. The werker then arranged hewever, as date, he had net heard frem DCFS. regarding success or failure ef the new ceunseling group. Apparently CHAS eften dees provide ceunseling to. a mother even when her children have been placed in a CHAS fester horne. In Tracy's case, the mether refused to. participate in ceunseling and prebably lost an eppertunity to. werk with the same casewerker who. was ceunseling her children. To. determine hew the case against James Brewn had been handled, we interviewed Ceek CeuntyAssistant State's eccurred during .. Brewn' s trial that eventually resulted in a plea negetiatien. Tracy's mether \"flipped\" en the stand and altered the stery she had given the pelice and presecuters. She said that she had been in ttiebath\u00ad reem and did net see what had happened when Tracy was hurt, greatly weakening the state's murder case. -178-~ ! I I I I i.l There alse.was a preblem getting seme expert testimony Bernard's Hespital had ag~eed to. t~stify that Tracy's injuries fit the classic abuse scenar1e. The Judge, hewever, sustained ebjectiens by the defense an~ . ef these facters, Lecalle believed Brewn might be acqu1tted en the murder charge. He therefere agreed to. reduce the char~e frem murder to. inveluntary manslaughter in exchange fer a gU1lty plea. ' Lecalle teld,us tha~ the aggravated battery charge filed be\u00ad cause ef the aunt s beat1ng never went to. trial because she was a very emetienal girl who. was generally unwilling to. discuss the case. He added that she had been cerrespending with Brewn while he ~as in,jail and that she seemed to. be unwilling to. testify aga1nst h1m. Ultimately, Brewn pled guilty to. inveluntary manslaughter on March 4, 1980, and was sentenced by Judge Jehn Pewers Crewley to. a twe-year term in the Cerrectiens. ,AS mentiened earlier in efficer's supe~V1S1en) Michael.

Brewn:s pr~se~ce,at the hearing was waived. feund in cas~ report;:, were related to. lack ef adequate staff in the Infermatl.en and Heferral Unit. DCFS had been shert on beth prefessienal and clerical staff. When we mentiened eur difficul\u00ad t~es in finding\",infermatien en the children in this family, we dlscevered that there were preblems because DCFS was handling three names that all related to. the same case: Brewn, and the -179->r\"~Q4 .\u00a5 two different last names of Tracy and Michael. The different abuse reports had not been cross-listed, and tlit:! State Central Registry had no information regarding abuse of a person with Tracy's last name. We were told that there were problems within the Department regarding cross-indexing. The supervisors with whom we spoke em\u00ad phasized that the real problem was lack of manpower, not any \"fault\" within the Department. As we have noted, DCFS determined in one of its original as\u00ad sessments that the mother in this case was at-risk with her other children. Her children were removed from her care not because she was actively abusive toward them, but because she had a chronic pattern of involvement with violent men. The mother played a pas\u00ad sive role in the abuse of her children; therefore, DCFS wisely removed her children from the home after Tracy had died from her injuries. As in all the cases we reviewed, DCFS provided services for the children and the mother through private agency channels. And, as we have seen at least once before, the mother encountered prob\u00ad lems in initial counseling and requested alternative therapy. Finally, we found problems with missing documentation in the DCFS files. We have often encountered missing and inaccurate in\u00ad formation. This case provided the additional problem of our not being able to find information because there were several names involved in the'case. DCFS staff admitted there had been errors when the information was first logged in. We are fairly certain that these errors would not occur today, with the revamped and more sophisticated State Central Registry. Still, adequate docu~ mentation remains a problem within the Department. At the conclusion of our investigation the two children were in the foster care system and probably will remain there. B. Erika Boyd Chicago Police Department records state that officers were summoned on February 9, 1980, to an apartment on the city's north side. Chicago Fire Department paramedics had already been con\u00ad tacted by an anonymous caller, had arrived, and were preparing to transport the victim, 4~-year-old Erika, to Edgewater Hospital. Police officers spoke with the giJ~l's mother, Darlene Boyd, and her boyfriend, Larry Bey. Bey gavE~ several conflicting ac\u00ad counts of incidents leading up to Erika's injuries, but eventually admitted that he had spanked,the girl and had hit her with an elec\u00ad trical cor.d. Her mother, Darlene Boyd; also admitted hitting her with the electrical cord, but neither would explain how Erika sus- tained severe head injuries. . When Erika arrived at Edgewater Hospital, a nurse contacted CPS. According to the initial CPS report, Erika had sustained : , '~ 1 IImultiple contusions, abrasions and welt-type injuries over the entire surface of her body; also sustained subdural hematoma, caus\u00ad ing extensive intercranial pressure \" Both Boyd and Bey were arrested. Boyd was charged with single counts of aggravated battery and cruelty to a child. Bey was charged with the same offenses but two counts of each. On February 15, 1980, Erika died from her injuries. Both Boyd and Bey were then indicted for murder. They were found guilty of involuntary manslaughter on December 30, 1980, and sentenced to terms in the Illinois Department of Corrections. Boyd was to serve three years and Bey was to serve eight years. In some ways, this case appeared to be straightforward\u00a7, but other elements of the case were puzzling, such as the fact that there had been no previous reports of abuse to Erika. We spoke with an attending nurse in Edgewater Hospital's Emer\u00ad gency Room. She had b~en on duty when Erika was brought ,in semi\u00ad conscious on February 9~ 1980.. She recalled that when Erika was brought to the hospital in critical condition by paramedics, her injuries and bruises imm~diately suggested the possibility of abuse. The nurse also recalled that Boyd, the girl's mother, was with her wh.en she was admitted but would say nothing except that she had found Erika in a beaten condition. She also remembered Boyd's saying that she would say nothing more until she had an attorney present. This response, and Boyd's lack of concern for the girl, confirmed for all involved their suspicions that Erika had been abused. Erika was moved to the trauma unit soon after admission. A neurosurgeon on' duty recommended that she be transferred to Children's Memorial Hospital. While Erika was being transferred, the Emergency Room nurse contacted DCFS. She remembered that the CPS worker seemed genu\u00ad inely concerned with the severity of the case and was impressed with how he handled it over the telephone. Commission investigators also spoke with Dr. Robert Kirschner, a Cook County Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy on Erika Boyd. He told us that Erika had sustained a subdural hematoma and that the actual cause of death was head injuries. He added that she must have been severely beaten with some solid object, such as a stick, and that she had been whipped with an electrical cord. Kirschner said that had Erika lived, she would probably' have had \"residual effects\" from repeated blows to the head. Kirschner $aid that it is sometimes difficult to determine exactly how injuries have been sustained in abuse cases and that some cases are difficult to prove because there may be no obvious connection between external and internal injuries. Often, there are no exterior injuries, even though there may be subdural hema\u00ad tomaand extensive brain damage. He -181-\" -~-~ -------~ however, because Erika had ~ustained injuries from head to toe. He also said that these cases would be easier to prove if clear pictures were taken ~f ~he children an~ their injuries as soon as possible after adm~ss~on to the hosp~tal. Kirschner showed us Chicago police Department photographs taken while Erika was still at Edgewater Hospital, which show the bruises but not other areas of injury. Another set of photographs taken by the Medical Examiner's Officer was complete, but because of the time lag between the injuries and the photographs, many of the bruises had disappeared or were fading away. Kirschner added that many hospitals do not bother to take photographs an~ that when the police take them, they should be prepared by tra~ned evidence technicians. Kirschner added two further points of interest. The first is that in his experience with abuse cases, it is simple for a parent to blame another child for injuries when there is more than one child in the home. Many of these cases go unfounded. The second point, a procedural one, is that his offi~e will now con\u00ad tact DCFS anytime it conducts an autopsy on a ch~ld of whom DC~S is unaware. In these cases, a DCFS nurse will come over and d~s\u00ad cuss the case with the performing pathologist. He said that these cases are handled very well. We will report the comments that Kirschner made in his autopsy report: This 4 year old black female was severely beaten about the head, trunk and extremities. She developed a subdural hematoma and associated cerebral injury as a result of this beating. Many of the contusions and abrasions of the skin show a U shaped; loop patterned marking characteristic of the injury inflicted by a loop of electrical cord or similar instrument. There are other contusions that suggest that a stick or similar weapon may also have been used. This child's death was caused by the injury she sustained in this incident. Kirschner added the final notation to make clear the cause of de~th. Technically speaking, Erika died of pneumonia. But that pneumon~a was caused by injuries that had been inflicted upon her. All CPS contact with Erika's family had been by telephone, and most contacts had been with police and hospital staff. No CPS worker went out because Erika's survival was unlikely, there were no other children involved in the case, and both the perpe\u00ad trators had been arrested. Even though they expected Erika to die, CPS workers did file the appropriate papers to obtain tem\u00ad porary custody of the girl if she survived. (We were told that a DCFS nurse had visited the hospital while Erika was there, but nothing could be foundin the file to conf:i,rm that any such visit ever had been made. Such vis'its usually would be documented by reports in the case file.) -182-I Erika's case illustrates the tremendous need for greater pub\u00ad lic awareness of the realities of child abuse and the extent of the problem: private citizens need to ma~e reports of abuse be\u00ad cause mandated reporters do not see all cases of abuse. Nobody in the child protective system became aware of Erika's abuse until it was too late. Cook County Assistant State's Attorney Lawrence Hyman told us that the case against Boyd and Bey was going to be a bench trial but at the pre-trial conference the defendants agreed to plead guilty to charges of involuntary manslaughter. At the conference, Bey admitted that he had repeatedly hit Erika with an extension cord. Boyd did not reveal her role in the abuse except to say that she \"briefly\" whipped Erika with the same cord. As the result of this plea-bargaining, Judge Thomas Maloney sentenced Bey to eight years in prison. Hyman told us that the judge probably would have imposed a stiffer sentence had Bey's previous arrest record included arrests for child abuse or related crimes. (Though Bey had a three-page arrest record dating back to March, 1963, most of the arrests were for offenses such as theft, unlawful use of a weapon, and numerous assaults.) Judge Maloney sentenced Darlene Boyd to three years in pri- son. Hyman mentioned that he had seen potential problems with the case. He referred to the fact that Erika had died, technically, of pneum.onia contracted after surgery to relieve pressure on her brain, the result of injuries she suffered in the beatings. Hyman said that in his opinion, the defense could have argued that the surgery and the resultant pneumonia were the cause of death. Hyman also mentioned that there were no external head injuries. In such a case, the defense could have argued that it was unclear which injuries could have been caused by blows to the head and which might have been caused by neurosurgery. Commission staff also spoke with Judge Maloney. He told us he had given Bey what is termed an \"over-extended sentence.\" He said that involuntary manslaughter carries a sentence of five years but that the sentence can be increased up to double that perj'Jd of time depending on aggravating circumstances. Judge Maloney took into account Bey's prior arrest record and the heinousness of thiS particular crime in his sentencing decision. Judge Maloney took into account mitigating circumstances in sentencing Darlene Boyd to three years in prison. She had no prior arrest record. The judge also mentioned the difficulty in pin\u00ad pointing the actual perpetrator in a child abuse case: h~said that'neither of the defendants would admit to inflicting the head wounds. As a result, he felt that murder could not be provedo As this report is being written, Larry Bey is serving his sentence in Stateville Correctil')nal Center. -183-....;:\u00ab a .40 Darlene Boyd was remanded to the custody of the Department of Corrections and was sent to the, Dwight Correctional Center in December, 1980. Dwight Correctional Center Commission staff spoke with several different personnel at Dwight over a ten-month period. Boyd's correctional counselor told us that very little information accompanied Boyd on her trans\u00ad fer sheet when she first came to Dwight. She did know that Boyd had abused her child, though. Her file also contained a state\u00ad ment from Hyman indicating the circumstances of Erika's abuse as well as the details of Boyd and Bey's arrests. The counselor told us it is always a problem when an inmate is transferred with little information in the file. She said that Boyd was a very private person who asked to be held in protective custody during mas~ of her stay at Dwight. Boyd never volunteered any information about the abusive incident. Whenever the counselor brought it up, Boyd remained Silent, leading the counselor to be\u00ad lieve that Boyd could no~ admit to herself what she had done. Boyd was scheduled for release on August 7, 1981. Her coun\u00ad selor told us that she had accumulated enough \"good time,\" a one day credit for each day served without incident, for her release to occur before she had served half of her sentence. Besides the correctional counselor, we spoke with a mental health counselor at Dwight. Both agreed that there was much more opportunity for counseling to occur at Dwight than in any of the men's prisons because the population was quite small in compari\u00ad son. We asked the mental health counselor how she felt about Boyd being released without having received any effective counseling. She responded that Erika Boyd's death was a \"situational crime\" in that Darlene Boyd was influenced by and went along with Larry Bey. She concluded that since Boyd would not. be with Bey when she was released, she should not abuse any other children. When we suggested that Boyd might become att'ached to another person much like Bey, the mental health counselor agreed that it was likely. The correctional counselor said that either she or Boyd's other counselor had recommended psychia~ric counseling as a condi\u00ad tion or recommendation for parole. Then the correcticnal coun\u00ad selor called someone in Administration to determine the Prisoner Review Board's decision regarding Boyd's parole. She was told there were no recommendations or conditions on parole at all. Thus, all Boyd would have\" to do upon release is report monthly to her parole agent, stay out of trouble, and remain in Illinois. We were told that prisoners from downstate Illinois often receive no recommendations for treatment or counseling because of lack of resources; Cook County has the best resources. The correctional counselor admittedothat in Boyd's case, counseling given about child abuse had been inadequate. -184-In July, l~Hl, we aSKeci the correctlonal counselor anout a program phased in at Dvlig\"ht iJy Child Abus,e Uhi t for Studies, Ec1ncat.ion (C]I~USES). She told us tha'c she :1.ad :been involved in \\'lri ting the proposal\" but that very Ii ttle had been done in terms of actual trea\"tment. She added that sorae counseliing had been provic.ed by Dr. Nahman Greenberg ana '::{ravitz services, arid private grou::?s. -' She said that though the proposal called/for training of Dwight staff it never occurred. Trained Dwight staff were supposed to help ~ounsel inmateS. The correctional counselor said that the program had not proceeded beyond the first or second phase of ~ five-phase program. She felt this was unfortunate because the program definitely was needed. Commission staff analyzed the program narrative for the pro\u00ad gram, titled \"Collaborative project with pwi~ht Correction~l Cen\u00adter (D.O.C.), of Famlly Ser\u00ad vices & C.A.U.S.E.S.\" Program objectives follow: 1) 2) 3) 4) To provide in-service training to social service/mental health professional staff at Dwight in the assessment, interviewing and treatment skills and approaches for women residents with histories of infant/child maltreatment (child abuse) To develop screening methods to assist in the identifi\u00ad cation of women with previous physical abuse of an in\u00ad fant or child and/or to identify women residents with children who are apparently at-risk of engaging in overt aggressive behavior towards one or more of their chil\u00ad dren. TO develop followup release services for women identi'~ fied as abusive to their children. To develop an improved system to facil~tiate mother-child visitation. 5) To develop improved communications between DCFS and DOC regarding families being served in common. The program narrative states that seminars wi~l ~e given ~o Dwight staff on the origins, dynamics, and characterlstlcs of Chlld abuse; that \"demonstration .l,nterviews with women residents known to hav: physically abused or more children\" ,wil~ ~e conducted DWlght wlll be an ongolng , objective. The narrative also states that women will complete question\u00ad naires focusing on: possible previou,s problems ,with ,the,ir chi~dren; an inventory form will be developed \"to,ldentJ.fy abu~e :-n the past or the futu:r:,e by meas1,;lring personallty characterJ.stJ.cs found in <4 4* , knewn te DCFS fer abuse .of a child will be invited te talk abeut these matters fer purpeses .of clinical services and with the receg\u00ad nitien and understanding .of net legally jeepardizing their situa\u00ad tien .or bringing abeut additienal supervisery concern\u00ad ing the pregram and were teld that by May .of 1981, abeut 50 .of, Dwight's 370 inmates had received service frem CAUSES. These ~n\u00ad mates need net have been child abusers; any inmate expressing a need fer ceunseling regarding parenting skills was eligible te receive CAUSES' ceunseling. He said that Bernice Kravitz was the primary werker with these wemen; he alse said that this pa~t .of the CAUSES preject was successful bey end anyene's expectat~ens. We were teld, en the ether hand, that in-service 'training had been the mest disappeinting part .of the CAUSES pregram. CAUSES was suppesed te previde 16 in-service training sessiens, but as .of June 9 1981, nene had been conducted. He said he had yette meet anye~e managing .or supervising any .of the werk being dene\" and the pregram was abeut te end en June 30 with ne extensiens that he knew .of. The supervising psyche legist felt tllat the per\u00ad tien .of the ceunseling by Bernice Kravitz sheuld be centinued, even if funding had to be assumed cempletely by DOC. Our cenversatiens with Darlene Beyd's ceunselers at Dwight made it clear that there is a preblem with making recemmendatiens te the Parele Beard. The cerrectienal ceunseler teld us that re\u00ad perts are submitted to the Beard toe seen after an ,inmate arrives witheut adequate time fer ceunselers te assess an ~nmate's needs. This becemes, an acute preblem when an inmate serves .only a shert sentence. Alse, while ceunselers can make recemmendatiens te the Beard in writing, they cannet be present at 'the hearing te empha\u00ad size special needs in any particular case. The mental health ceunseler teld us that , in Bey <;;1 , s case, any recemmendatiensgiven te the Beard prebably wO\\.lld~be useless. She felt that this was the case mest .of the time. The mental health ceunseler was enceuraged by Beyd's request that seme sert .of ceunseling be set up fer her felle~ing her re\u00ad lease. She made an appeiBtment for Beyd at the Lake, Ceunty Men\u00ad tal Health Center in Waukegan. When .our investi~ater mentiened that Waukegan seemed te be awfully far te t,ravel,we were teld that ether mental health centers had been centacted and they had referred Beyd elsewhere each time. The mental health counselor, admitted te us that she had no idea where Waukegan was at the t~me she made the appeintment for Boydo The supervisory psychologist Dwigh,t teld us his dees not \"routinely\" make recommendations fer counsel~ng fer ~n;;\u00ad mates who had been child abusers, theugh he aclrnitted that in Beyd's case \"it might ,haVe been a goed idea.\" He blamed lack .of trai~\u00ad ing and manpewer at Dwight fer lack .of adequate treatment fer ~n\u00ad mates. He added that Dwight~s mental health cempenent functiens -186-the same as mental health units in cemmunities: if a persen dees net want to coeperate with ceunsel~ng, there is nething that the staff can de abeut it. He suggested that perhaps the Department .of Correctiens sheuld adept a rule that in cases in ,which a weman has been invelved in a child abuse crime,cQul1selol'.'s must recommend te the Priseners Review Beard that the inmate receive ceunseling upen release. This rule ceuld be medified': fer instances in which an inmate re\u00ad spends to ceunseling while still incarcerated and staff dees net think that she needs additienal ceunseling after release. We spoke with a decter at the LakE;!Ceunty Mental Health Center, whe said that Beyd had made an appeintment but that she had net shown up. He added that ne new appointment had been made. The decter was net surprised, theugh; he teld us that child abusers require seme leve~age te ferce them te make their appointments. Darlene Beyd exercised her rights as a prisener in the Illineis Department .of Cerrections system by refusing ceunseling. Hewever, she was released with ne recemmendatiens .or cenditicns placed upen her parele, in spite .of her refusal tc deal with the crime she had cemmitted. The limited efferts by Dwight cerrectienal staff aftercare fer Beyd were easily circumv~nted. Th~re is little te suggest that sre weuld net repeat the cr~me fcr wh~ch she was St. James Hespital Chicage Heights. The fcllew\u00ad ing day, Medical Examiner Rebert J. Stein perfermed an autcpsy en the .child and determined the cause .of death tc be hemeperiteneum (laceratien .of the liver) as the result .of \"blunt trauma.\", That same day, the girl's mether was placed under arrest:>by eff~cers .of the East ChicagO Heights Pelice Department, charged with murder. The first case of abuse .of Niccle reperted to DCFS .occurred en Nevember 24, 1979. A CPS werker tcck a call frem a medical assistant working in Park Ferest. The dectcr had dector cencluded that the \"burns\" might , ,have been caused by a severe discharge. At the time .of the exam~\u00ad nation the decter reccmmended that Nicole be , Memerial Hespital. The decter planned te X-ray arm, which was slightly swellen, and te perferm b,leed tests. A ,CPS casewerker The CPS werker met with the mether and her estranged husband whe was visiting at the time.

The mothe~ was unable to explain the whip marks; she sald she had never noticed them before. The marks on his stom\u00ad ach were from hot grease splashing on him while she was cooking she said. \" ' The worker's report is interesting for its initial assess\u00ad ment of the family in November, 1979. Excerpts from the report follow: The evidence of abuse is most prevalent in this family, so too is the ripeness of the mother to abuse. She is lonely, depressed, and, without support. [She] received little or no nurturing as a child and has few parenting skills. She has grossly un\u00ad realistic expectations for Nicole and projects her own feelings of inadequacy to this child. Still, [she] related warmly with Adam, and he showed no signs of inhibition. [She] stated that she took Nicole to Dr. because she fell down a lot and doesn't talk well. She stated that people tell her there's something wrong with Nicole, and she wanted to have it checked out. [She] reiterated what she'd told the hospital about the marks Nicole has; she has no idea how Nicole received them. [She] cried often throughout the interview and said it would hurt her to have the children removed. These children seem to represent still another attempt of [the mother's] to have her needs met. As far as being dangerous to the children, she did not at all strike me as one who would burn them. She ad\u00ad mitted hitting the child~en with her hand and with a belt, but said she did npt recall ~iver leaving bruises. (:' There are two or three possibilities to be considered. Maybe, [she] has been abusive, perhaps at times when the children be\u00ad came too demanding about getting their needs met. Maybe, she was covering,for her husband who, ;erc:;>m her description, could very well be abu~ive. He's young and unhappy with his r~sponsi-bilities. ~ At any rate, further investigation is indicated here. [The mother] has expressed a desire to receive assistance and coun\u00ad seling, and homemaker services may be in order whether the chil- dren are removed or not. \" Her report contains her supervisor's comment that the \" situation is high-risk and in need of immeQiate intervention. ,\" The case then appears to have been assigned to another GPS 0 worker. His fir~j:, series of case notes cover the period from Novem\u00ad ber 24, 1979 ,to ~jtarch 27, 1980. The notes indicate that he visited t~e mother and Nicole at Ingalls Memoria,'!. on November 28, 1979. HJ.s notes state that Nicole had severa,l injuries, all of which were explained away by Nicole's mother. ' Th~, ne~t contact took plaC'e more than a month late!;, in spite of the prevJ.ous note that the ,case was in need of immediate inter\u00ad vention because of its high-risk nature., This pext contact con- -1SS~ J \\~ . sisted of a dall from the new CPS worker to Nicole's mother; she told him that her children were doing just fine. Another month passed and the worker phoned the mother again. He got no answer. About a week later, he phoned again, and again received no answer. The day after this second call, February 14, 1980, the worker drove out to the home. No one answered the door. In spite of all these f,ailed attempts to establish contact, he waited for more than a month to recontact the family. He placed another telephone calIon March 26, 19S0, and found that the tele\u00ad phone had been disconnected. \" He then sent a mailgram to the home requesting a home visit, which finally took place on March 27, 1 ~8cQ. Case notes from the meeting indicate that Nicole appeared ~o be in good health1 and the mother was pregnant. \\\\ ~ 'b d The caseworker learned that the mother had gotten a JO an that Nicole's paternal grandmother had been babysitting for the children. He gave the mother information about Parental Stress for help with her pregnancy, job, or children. His notes sta~e that the mother was \"not likely to intentionally harm [the chl.l\u00addren]We are closing the case on this family at t,his time. II The r~port is dated May S, 19S0, two months before Nicole's death. Other material in the DCFS case file deals with events that occurred after DCFS received ,notice of Nicole's death. Commission investigators interviewed East Chicago Heights Chief of police Jack Davis and Sergeants Charles McCary and George Nance about their roles in the case after Nicole's death. On \"july 17, 19S0, at 4:45 p.m., Nance received a radio call that a chl.ld could not be awakened at her nearby home. He arrived wi~hin three minutes and found the mother standing in the doorway cryl.ng. Enter\u00ad ing the h031se,he saw Nicole lying in a strange posf.tion on t~e living room couch \"as if she had been placed there. Paramedl.cs from the East Chicago Heights Fire Department already ha~ responded ,and were trying to revive Nicole. Nance felt that the gl.rl prob\u00ad ably was already dead, partially because her body was cold. He told us the mother said to him, \" 1 don't know wh~t's the mat-ter She ha(C:i a cold, a few, days ago; she came in and laid down on the'couch.\" Paramedics could not revive the girl, and transported her to St. Ja.mes Hospital. At the hospital, emergency room personnel worked on Nicole for about an hour. When she would not respond, she was pronounced dead-on-arrival at 6: 02 p.m: ' Nance ~old us that while she was being worked on at the hospl.tal, brul.,se marks were apparent \"all 'over her ,body\" and she waso/:'t;>leeding from her nose and her ears.' Emergency room nurses conLl.rmed the strong possibility of child abuse. ~) DCFS received a report of child abuse from a nurse at st. James Hospital at 7: 4,9 p.m. on\" July 17, 19S0. Sergeant McCary phoned was d.o.a. with multiple, extensive bruises over the body. The mother said the child came in and laid down, and she could not waken her when she went to give her a glass of milk. The mother-paramour tried to have the child picked up by an undertaker, but the hospital is holding the body. Following the reconunendation of DCFS officials, police took protective custody of Nicole's brother, Adam, at about 10:00 p.m. Adam was taken to St. James Hospital far an examination, and was placed in emergency foster care the next day. That same day, July 18, 1980, both parents carne to the East Chicago Heights police station. A DCFS worker was also present. The police asked the parents about a neighbor's report of hearing a child being whipped in Nicole's house early the day she died. The mother admitted that she could have beaten Nicole early that morning but had no recollection of the act. She attributed this to loss of memory or \"blackouts\" that she supposedly sometimes ex\u00ad perienced. She insisted, however, that she alone had caused Nicole's bruises. She explained that on the day of her death, Nicole had been playing with water in the toilet as she had done on previous occasions, so she whipped Nicole on her legs and buttocks. Nicole walked out of the bathroom, stumbled into a living room coffee table, and fell to the floor. The mother stated that she lifted Nicole onto the sofa and shook her. At that point, Nicole seemed to be gasping and having convulsions, so the mother telephoned for an ambulance. Nance told us the father would allow his wife to talk to the police only when he was present, and seemed unconcerned about his daughter's death. Nance suspected that both parents were involv~d in the beatings, and fabricated a story to protect the father. !\\ Nance was skeptical of the fatper's story that he had been play-,r ing basketball when the last beating occurred, although a friend later corroborated this alibi. After being advised of her constitutional rights, the mother, in the presence of an Assistant State's Attorney, offered the fol\u00ad lowing version of what had happened to Nicole: Mrs. stated in summary but .not verbatim that in the afternoon hours she was home alone with victim and her four year old son. Victim took a glass of water from the to,ilet and defendant \"walloped\" victim with a belt. Victim fell and hit her chest on a cocktail table. Defendant picked child up and put her on the couch at this time. Victim was still breath\u00ad ing and defendant notified ambulance. Defendant further stated that she punished victim in past in same manner for same be\u00ad havior. In fact,one week earlier, she \"walloped\" victim for the same behavior. Mrs. told ASA that she would give a court report.ed statement. However, upon talking to her attorney, she no longer wished to give a written statement. -190-I I f 'I' , f I.' '( 14 'j: I i~ ---------- According to Nance, Adam told him two days after Nicole's death that he had seen his mother abuse Nicole. CPS interviewed Adam the day after Nicole died. He told CPS workers that Nicole had been home all day because she WdS sick. When asked why she was Sick, Adam replied that his moth~r had whipped Nicole. He said that his father had not participated in the whipping. Be\u00ad cause of his age, however, Adam would not be allowed to testify at his mother's trial. The three police officers described some of their problems in working on this case. They said they no longer had photographs of Nicole lying on the couch because the photographs had been turned over to the State's Attorney's Office. (When we mentioned that the State's Attorney had no photographs, the officers said that it would not be the firs't time that evidence photographs had been misplaced.) They were further frustrated because the neighbor who had heard the sounds of whipping refused to testify in courto They 'also said that they probably could have gotten a written con\u00ad fession from the mother, but waited for involvement from the State's Attorney's Office so that no \"loopholes\" could be used to challenge the confession. The police mentioned no problems with CPS or other DCFS work\u00ad ers. They informed us, though, that after Nicole's brother had been placed with his father's mother, she allowed him to return to his father. Nance called this case the worst he had ever worked on dur\u00ad ing his 21-year police career. He emphasized the emotional strain he was under, saying that he had worked on many homicides, but none had affected him as strongly as Nicole's. DCFS case notes covering the period from July 17, 1980 (the day of Nicole's death) to August 26, 1980 describe a good deal of casework. The CPS worker contacted everyone who had even ~ remote connection to the case, including neighbors, the children's pediatrician, and the Cook County Jail psychiatrist, psychologist, and social worker who had been working with Nicole'p mother. His analytical case notes provide a good perspective on this case: [The mother] came out of a family setting that offered 'little real mothering to her. Her mother deserted her as an alcoholic and she was raised in part by her older sisters and a step\u00ad mother. [The father] reported that her sisters used to beat her. Ms. noted that there was little closeness be- tween [the mother] and her mother, and she had to raise her\u00ad self. [She] wasn't. close to her own sisters and die!, not allow them to babysit for her children. [She] specifically requested that Adam be placed with people on [the father's] side of the fami~y rather than with her own natural family. [Her] becoming a mother at 16 gave her little time to have all of her own developmental needs met. Unrealistic expectations on Nicole as evidenced by bruises lef,t on her in November, 1979, over potty training incidents as well as unhappy marriage -191-\\ , -, , .--added to the pressure that [she] must have felt. [The father] told worker that he had taken [her] several times to a Family Services Center for counseling in Chicago Heights at [her] re\u00ad quests but this ended in the summer of 1979. Several of the family in retrospect felt that [she] needed psychiatric help but none suggested this to her. None of the other relatives noted any serious physical abuse on Nicole. She was seen by two DCFS;workers on March 27, 1980, and no evidence of physical abuse wa~\"seen. The family pedia\u00ad trician, Dr. , who examinEd Nicole numerous times, was never able to find evidence of physical abuse on Nicole. Her last examination of Nicole on July 3, 1980 revealed no evi\u00ad dence of physical abuse. On the other hand, [the father] had been physically abusive to his wife on occasion and was in con\u00ad tact with his daughter within the time period that she could have received the blows that lacerated her liverca~sing her to bleed to death. The worker's recommendations include: expert psychiatric care for the mother; clinical evaluation of the father :to deter\u00ad mine his ability to provide for Adam in the future; clinical evalu\u00ad ation of the mother if she is released from jail and one cannot be performed by her treating psychiatrist at Cermak Hospital; ef\u00ad forts to keep Adam in touch with his father and his other rela\u00ad tives; and limited, but unsupervised, visits during the day be\u00ad tween Adam and his father. Later, the juvenile court allowed un\u00ad supervised, overnight visits. DCFS approved of this arrangement. In January, 1981, a Commission investigator interviewed Cook County Assistant State's Attorney Michael Boyle concerning the case I s progress. At the time of the ,interview , the mother had been found mentally fit to stand trial; a psychiatrist also ce~ti\u00ad fied that, in his opinion, she had been legally sane at the tin.'e the incidents involving Nico'le occurJ:\"ed. Boyle was ready for trial. He agreed that the husband might have had something to do with the abuse, but said that such involvement could not be proved. In the interim, the mother had given birth to a daughter, Louise. DCFS gained custody of Louise and placed her in foster care. The mother was released on bond sometime between September, 1980, and January, 1981. She went to live with her husband' at hi?' mother'S home. On December~19, 1981, Judge Cornelius Houtsma granted a de\u00ad fense motion for m~ptrial. The motion concerned the testimony of Dr. Robert Stein, the Cook County Medical Examiner. BaSically, the central issue 'was that Dr. Stein originally deSignated the' manner of death in his autopsy report on Nicole as \"undetermined.\" La ter, after consulting St. James' emergency room reports-, Dr. Stein changed his opinion of the manner of death, testifying that it was \"homicide.\" The defense had been given only a copy of the report with \"undetermined\" on it. ('. As soon as Stein testified in court that the manner of death was homicide, the defense moved for a mistrial, arguing that Dr. -192-I i , ! ,- f. ~ ~ V , f t Ie I- ~- I r~ r ~{ ~ , : ~ I I I , I I 1 J I a \" , t th Judge Houtsma sus-Stein's testimony came aS,a s,:rp~se 0 _emthat the state had the tained the motion forfa m~st~l~~ea~~n~~~e~f death.

The story also mentions that DCFS had been involved with this family before Fleanice was killed. One source of information on this case was Fleanice's maternal grandmother. She told the Commission that she first called the DCE'S child abuse hotline in September of 1980 to report that Fleanice had been taken to the Woodlawn Hospital Emergency Room because ~f cuts on her forehead. The girl's mother ~aid Fleanice was in\u00ad Jured when she fell out of bed and hit her head on an ashtray. The grandmother told us that she became suspicious of the treatment that Fleanice was receiving from her stepfather when on September 16th, Fleanice had to have her stitches remo~ed and seemed \"petrified\" to leave the medical center with Pedro. Fleanice clung to her grandmother and asked to stay with her. The grand\u00ad mother decided to call the police because of her granddauahter's react~on. .The police discussed the situation with the family and Fleanlce flnally agreed to leave with her mother but, according to the grandmother, still avoided Pedro. Sometime around October 14th, the grandmother heard that Dorinda and.pedro were taping Fleanice's mouth shut for some reason. She declded to call the police again and met them at her daughter's horne. The grandmother said that during the conversation which e~sued, Pedro did all the talking. She said she became very upset wlth ~er dau~hter for not explaining what had been happening with Fleanlce. Flnally, the grandmother hit Dor.inda and then Pedro slapped the grandmother. Dorinda signed a complaint and the grand\u00ad mother was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct. Accofding to the grandmother, she called DCFS the next day to report-the mouth-taping incident. Two DCFS intake workers sub~ mitted an initial report on October 15th alleging that .. Fleanice had had her mouth taped shut as a reaction to her use of foul lan\u00ad ~uage~ The workers recommended follow-up by CPS but added that Lmrnedlate response was unnecessary because the case was not an emergency. A supervisor assigned CPS caseworker Doris Fair to the case on October 17th. Fair contacted the grandmother, who told her that she wanted custody of Fleanice. Fair stated that she would investigate the charges and get back to the grandmother. Fair discussed the use of tape over Fleanice's mouth with both Dorinda and Pedro and ad- ,vised them not to discipline their child in that way again. A ~ummary case review filled out by another DCFS worker states that Fc:-1r and ~he Grays,also discussed the couple's admission that they hlt Fleanlce as an added disciplinary measure. Fair later tol~ ~s she c~uld not recalL, this discussion but added that she defln~tely haa seen no evidence of physical abuse. She questioned F17an;ce abou~ the taping incident and could only offer that the Chlld s reactlon was \"puzzling.\" Fair decided that Fleanice might be hyperactive and told the Grays. that she would' be returning , with a nurse examine their Fair recontacted the grandmother and told her that she had found no indications of any serious abuse and was going to recom\u00ad mend that Fleanice remain in the custody of Dorinda and Pedro. On october 27, 1980, Fair contacted CPS nurse Sharon Balcitis, a supervisor in the Division of Child Protection, to request that she conduct a physical examination of Fleanice. Balcitis told US that this type of request is a rather informal action on the part of a caseworker and no supervisory permission is needed. Balcitis conducted a thorough examination of Fleanice and determined that, although the girl was active, she was not hyper\u00ad active. Balcitis found no signs of abuse, although she found a small bruise on Fleanice's head. Dorinda explained that this was the result of Fleanice hitting her head on an ashtray on the liv\u00ad ing room coffee table. Balcitis added that Fleanice was not ap\u00ad prehensive about the physical examination, and that she responded appropriately to both her mother and stepfather. A case review written after Fleanice died mentions that Balcitis noted reddish spots pn Fleanice's chest. Balcitis did not recall what the mother's explanation had been for the marks and added that they could not have been part of any abusive pattern, so her inability to remember the mother's response was insignificant. Balcitis remembered that she told the parents they probably should have Fleanice checked by a doctor for hyperactivity, since it was they who had been concerned that Fleanice might be overly active for a girl her age. Fair recalled the service plan that she prepared on Fleanice's case and said that Dorinda signed it. It included an agreement to take Fleanice for a follow-up examination at either the Wood\u00ad lawn Clinic or wyler's Hospital, an agreement to allow visitation by the maternal grandmother, and an agreement not to tape Fleanice's mouth shut. The follow-up examination was never done, according to Fair. While conducting further follow-up on the case, Fair spoke with members of Pedro's family on a couple of occasions. Pedro's mother gave Fair the impression that she did not want to get in\u00ad volved with the case or with her son's business. Fair added that she had the feeling that the mother might have been withholding something the first time she was interviewed, so Fair spoke with her again. After the second conversation, Fair was sure that her previous impressions were correct. Fair ~~d learn from Pedro's mother that another son had called the Chicago\\~olice Department on october 4, 1980, to report that he suspected)\"\\~eanice was being physically abused.. The police apparently coula not find any evidence of physical abuse and is\u00ad sued a verbal \"w-~rning\" to Dorinda and Pedro that the next time the police were-called, DCFS would be notified. Fair told us that tJ,1e police did not submit a report of any kinO. to DCFS with re- gard to this incident. -195- d The maternal grandmother told us that she went to court on the disorderly conduct charge in late October. Both Dorinda and Pedro were in the courtroom with Fleanice, who, according to the grandmother, had bruises allover her face. The grandmother said that she called Fair, who told her that she was too busy to come out that day to investigate. The grandmother told us that she begged Fair to come out to investigate before the bruises faded, and that eventually she did. Fair allegedly reported that there was absolutely no evidence of any physical abuse of Fleanice. Fair told us that she COUMj not recall receiving any call from the grandmother regarding the bruises on Fleanice's face, and nothing in the DCFS file reflects that Fair ever spoke with the grandmother about this incident or that a report ever was en\u00ad tered~ Fleanice's grandmother, who had custody of the child from late November of 1980 to mid-January, told 'us that she noticed bruises on Fleanice's buttocks and thighs on November 25. She took the child to the Woodlawn Medical Clinic, where a nurse and doctor examined her. The medical records indicate that Fleanice was examined and found to have a tender nasal bone as well as the bruises her grandmother had noticed. The doctor who performed the examination sa~~ it was never brought to his attention that Fleanice' s grandmo/Fher suspected her injuries were the result of physical abuse./ The grandmother, admitted that she didn't want to get the doctor involved in any abuse investigation, but claimed that she did notify Fair of this incident. Fair stated that she never received any information regard\u00ad ing the injuries or the medical examination performed on NovembE?J:\" 25. Fair said that had she been given the information, she cer-\"L tainly would have taken some action. She pointed out that if ab':lse had occurred, the doctor, a mandated reporter, should have con\u00ad tacted DCFS. No report was ever made. Fair remained dubious th~t this incident ever happened, because if it had, it would have only served to strengthen the grandmother\" s assertion that Fleanice was not being properly cared for. Fair did indicat~ that t~e grandmother had given her a radiol-' ogy report dated November 25, 1980 for an X-ray of Fleanice's nose, and a handwritten page which was attached to the report. The hand\u00ad written page was illegible so Fair had no idea that it pertained to the suspected inCident. (Corrunission investigators were able. to make out the report only after the examining doctor deciphered it.) Apparently the material was given to Fair by mistake. She had requested that the grandmother provide her with documentation that Fleanice had received a recent physical examination so that she could be enrolled in a day-care program. Fair said that she notified the grandmother that the records received were not ade\u00ad quate, and that the grandmother never indicated the records in ques\u00ad tion pertained to the physical abuse allegation. -196-I Fair told us that the Fleanice Gray case was officially un-, founded on December 24, 1980, during a routine case review between!: Fair and her supervisor, Helen Mullins. However, the case sum- i,\\ mary, Which was not completed by Fair, shows that the unfounding II took place on December 4. Fair stated that both she and Mullins agreed to unfound the case. She added that if she were to receive the same case today, she would indicate it and then still close it out. Fair said the issue was really quite simple: there was no evidence of physical abuse and, except ~or the taping of the mouth, nothing to suggest that anything wac wrong in the home. Finally, even the taping of the mouth was not viewed as severe. Fair also mentioned that she relied heavily on Mullins' experi\u00ad ence in unfounding this case because she had only been on the job for four months. ;1 // In mid-January, Dorin\u00a2!a and Pedro regained cust~bdy of Fleanice from the grandmother, with the assistance of the pol!~ce. Dorinda and Pedro married on January 22, 1981, and the granq,Inother never saw Fleanice again. '; A Commission investigator interviewed Sergeant Michael Hoke of the Chicago Police Department's Homicide Unit regarding this case. Hoke told us that on February 14, 1981, Dorinda/and Lawrence \"Pedroll Gray reported to the police that they had been robbed by two men in the alley behind their apartment. Police responded quickly with many men because the Grays claimed that not only were they robbed, but their daughter Fleanice had been kidnapped at the same time. Hoke said that he worked on the case from the very first day and it was obvious to him that there was something wrong with Gray's story. Hoke's eleven years of experience as a robbery detective told him that they were lying. He said that their stories were just too good and their descriptions were just too accufate. Hoke stated that most robbery victims simply cannot remember details as vividly as the Grays could, particularly 'since they had been robbed at night and in an alley. Also, never in his experience had anyone ever abducted a child in such a bizarre manner. For tn~ kidnappers to keep the child any longer than a few minutes while they escaped would have been foolish, so the police could have expected to find Fleanice no mo.re than a block or two from the robbery 'Hoke added that there was no way the robbers could have used the child to extort more money from the Grays, and keep\u00ad ing hel::) with them for any period of time would only draw atten- tion to \"them and slow them down. Hoke said that although he felt the story was fabricated, the police c.ontinued to follow up any lead the Grays furnished. At the same time, the police began to work on another angle: that the parents were somehow responsible for Fleanice's disappearance. Police officers learned from their can\"vass of the area that neigh\u00ad bors felt the parents had abused Fleanice be~ore~ even some rela .... tiv~s questioned Pedro Gray's story of the krdnapping. Further questioning of both relatives and neighbors, when compared to stories offered by the Grays, turned up minor inconsistencies. -197- d d While Pedro stuck to his story, the mother began to change minor details of hers, which had been exactly the same as her hus\u00ad band's. Hoke told us that a line-up was arranged for the Grays, who picked out one man as one of their assailants. This co~firmed some of Hoke's suspicions about the Grays because the man d1d not even remotely resemble the offende,r the Grays had described. Hoke speculated that by the time the line-up was conducted, Pedro was beginning to feel that his story had not been believed, so he used the line-up as a desperate way out. After the linei-up, the police brought the Grays in for addi\u00ad tional interviews. This time the two were separated because the police felt that the husband was exerting control over his wife~ Hoke said that with Pedro in another room, Dorinda broke down and told the police the truth. She told them that on February 12, two days before the police were called, Fleaniqe wet her bed and Pedro took her to the bathroom, where he beat her. When they re\u00ad turned from the bathroom, the mother noticed that the child's eye was swollen and bruised. On February 14, according to the mother, she got into an argument with Pedro, who told her to take her daugh\u00ad ter and leave the house. The mother did not want to leave, but Fleanice urged her to do so and go to the maternal grandmother's horne. The s~ep~ather apparently became incensed that his stepdaughter would 1nS1nuate that she would rather live with someone e~se, so he began to beat her again, hitting her head against a door and opening c: cut. Pedro then placed his stepdaughter into a tub of water 1n the bath\u00ad room. When the mother went into the bathroom to get her daughter out, she noticed that she was lying face up and was beginning to sink under the water. According to the mother, she grabbed ahold of Fleanice and tried to pull her out, but in doing so slipped . and hit Fleanice's head on the side of the bathtub. Then Fleanice tried to climb out by herself and supposedly hit her own head,agai:}. \"1 According to Dorinda, the stepfather tried to reviV~ F~eanice but couldn't. After it was obvious to.them both that Flean1ce was dead the stepfather apologized to his wife and said that it haCi.;:~-been' an accident. She said that he offered to turn himself in to the police but later changed his mind and threatened to kill her if she told police the truth. While both of the Grays cleaned. up the bathroom, which was full of blood, the stepfather moved Fleanice's body out of the way and set her on top of a rad.iator, where the body sustained burns. The Grays dressed Fleanice and put her 'into a plastiC g~rbage bag. They carried her from their house and dumped the body 1n an abandoned building at 6558 South Ingleside. Then they called the police with their story of robbery and abduction. Hoke told us that after Dorinda Grayr.completed her story, she offered to take detectives to the exact location where she and her husband had dumped th~ body. Hoke said that Pedro Gray was in the next room and somehow became aware that his wife was cooperating with police. He also became concerned with t~e crying -198-\\ ,. and hysteria of other members of his wife's family, who had con\u00ad gregated in the poliqe station and were easily visible to him. Hoke speculated that Gray must have thought that his only chance was to try to transfer blame for Fleanice's death onto his wife. He offered to give a statement implicating his wife in the beat\u00ad ings; he said that he participated in the cover-up only to pre\u00ad vent Dorinda from being arrested. Hoke said that Pedro Gray sim\u00adply was not very believable. DCFS records indicate that two days after Fleanice Gray died, the original report of abuse, whi~~ stemmed from the mouth-taping inCident, was changed from unfou~lded to indicated abuse. The re\u00ad cord indicates the original unfounding was \"in error II and that the mouth-taping should have been indicated. This report also showed that Fleanice had died and that the Grays had been charged in the case. CommiSSion investigators interViewed CPS Supervisor Helen Mullins abo:ut tJrLis case and asked her why she approved the unfound\u00ad ing of the case~\\ Mullis replied that there was no evidence of physical abuse 6h which to base an indicated report, and that she was satisfied that there had been no beatings or injuries inflicted upon Fleanice. She said that the mouth-taping incident certainly was not serious. Mullins added that the case looked like another intrusive relative case, this time in which the maternal grand\u00ad mother wanted to obtain custody. She added that Fleanice was staying with her grandmother at the t'ime the case was unfouiide'd and that she felt the child was out of danger. Mullins added that at the time, the case had been unfounded, th~ process of unfounding and indicating cases was relatively new and she had partiCipated in only a few unfoundings. She said there were no guidelines, either written or oral,for unfounding a case. The only guidance she had was the definition. of an allegation. Therefore, Mullins had to use her own discretion~in determining when to indicate or unfound a case. ~ report that Jeanine Smith, CPS Deputy Regional Administrator, haq made to DCFS Director Gregory Coler with regard to the Fleanice Gray case is excerpted as follows: The first week in January it was brought to my attention through the case review process that workers were unfounding excessive corporal punishment cases with supervisory approval. I do not understand\"the reasoning other than to state it was existent within the supervisory staff. I immediately instructed super\u00ad visors of this er~9r in jud~ent in at least two supervisors' meetings. The Gray case was unfounded prior to these meetinrrs although the ,supervisor should have kno'tm better, she and several others appari:mtly did not. When I discovered it I took cor\u00ad rective action. Mullins told us that Smith wasj{i'tilizing i'scare tactics ll on workers, particularly supervisors, as J result of irrational pressure ex\u00ad erted by Director Coler in r~sponse to cases liKe the Grays'. Mullins told us that as a dir~ct result of the Gray case, distinct -1.99- it, ~.----------- :1 g 44; :;:P .. guidelines were developed for handling cases involving corporal punishment. Mullins told us that until that case occurred, cor\u00ad poral punishment never was defined. When the Gray case surfaced, she and Fair were scapegoated and guidelines were then developed for corporal punishment cases: now, if a child is hit with \"an instrument\" no matter how lightly, it is to be indicated child abuse. Mullins said that 95% of the parents in the city would be child abusers if this definition were applied to them. When we asked Mullins if she could shed any light on apparent discrepancies in the summary review of the Gray case, she said that she could not, but she guessed that the summary review was composed under great pressure. Mullins described the atmosphere surrounding the review as one of panic; everyone involved with the case was very scared. She said that Coler and Gordon Johnson, a deputy director in Cook County, wanted a scapegoat, and the fi\u00ad nal review tends to incriminate both her and Doris Fair. Mullins added that when a case like the Gray case \"hits the papers\" there is always a tendency to try to find a scapegoat. We asked specifically why the report from December was un\u00ad founded while a report dated two days after Fleanice \"s death showed that the case was indicated. Mullins said that the new computer system was so back-logged that the original finding had not been entered into the computer by February 16, thereby allowing DCFS staff to change the original report and indicate the case. We poirlted out that it appeared that Falr had insufficient training and experience to handle serious CPS cases. When we asked whet-her training should not be provided these workers before they are assigned serious cases, ~llilins replied that the reality of the situation is that half oi'-her workers are always new. She said she felt that it is \"deplorable\" that new workers are assigned to \"tr:Lcky\" cases I but that she had no way of determininc,J in ad\u00ad vance which cases were going to be tricky.. She said that, con\u00ad Sidering it again, if she were faced with the same situation--with the same backlog and no one else aVailable--she probably would assign Fair to the Gray case again. Mull~ns said that she had to work, with what she had been given. Mullins' final comments were that there was nothing that DCFS could have done to remove Fleanice from the home to prevent her death. The only thing they possib~y could have done that they did not do was try to involve the falnily in intensive therapy; at the time they had the case, though, there had been no indica\u00ad tion that intensive therapy was necessary. She added that no one can force someone to receive counseling if that person does not want to. Nothing in the Gray case suggested that closer monitor\u00ad ing had been necessary or that it \\'lould have changed the ou,tcome of the case, Mullins said. It, should be noted that the report prepared by Jeanine Smith recommends that no disciplinary action be taken against Doris Fair due to the fact that she was undergoing training at the time of the Gray caae and had \"performed duties to the best ot her capa- -200-I I j bilities.\" Smith also recommended that Helen Mullins receive no more than an \"oral warning\" and that her actions should be viewed' as a \"supervisory error.\" Smith also agreed with Mullins' conten-. tion that the facts of this case did not warrant removal of Fleanlce from her parents' home. The Fleanice Gray case was not really complicated. It prob\u00ad ably was a case in which the child had been chronically abused. It was yet another situation in which the mother of a c.hild de\u00ad cided to live with, and then marry, a man unsuitable to raise chil\u00ad dren. DCFS was involved in the case as soon as it appeared like\u00ad ly that abuse would occur chronically; yet6 there never was clear\u00ad cut evidence that abuse was occurring. The grandmother in this case may have done more harm than good, finally, through her ef\u00ad forts to orchestrate the dissemination of information. The workers, with whom we spoke indicated that morale at DCFS is poor because the D'epartment will not stand behind its workers. Certainly that appears to be the case here. But this case was also flawed for reasons central to the larger problems at DCFS. The supervisor constantly had new workers having to handle sensi-tive CPS cases. Training was not provided for workers. Case- workers had to prioritize cases, and \u00b71:his case certainly did not appear to be a priority case. Reprimanding the supervisor in this case for a series of circumstances out of her control appears to have had a negative effect, not a positive one. Changing the child abuse report from \"unfounded\" to \"indicated\" as a result of Fleanice's death is an act that we do not fully understand. \" overall, this case illustrates that none of t~e ~roblems with\u00ad in the system were addressd as the result of Fleanlce s death. Instead, workers were instructed to change reports. A summary was developed in which specific caseworker and supervisor blame was assessed. Cook County CPS dey-eloped.a. series of arbitrary rules for the indication of cases in which corporal punishment has occurred, ,probably further clogging up future CPS work. DCFS continues to respond to crises and criticims by using a short-term approach; the real problems, such as lack of training and exper\u00adtise and poor co~~unications among professionals, are not addressed. On Thursday, June 24, 1982, Criminal Court Judge James Schreier found Lawrence \"Pedro\" Gray guilty of involuntary manSlaughter for the February 14, 1981 death of 'his stepdaughter, Fleanice. Both he and Dorinda Gray were found guilty of oipstructing justice and conC'ealing a homicide. During the trial e;:tch accused the other of killing Fleanice and then fabricating a stOry to protect the person responsible. \"Pedro\" Gray was sentenced to 14 years in prison by Judge Schreier who said that the man had displayed \"barbaric, uncivi\u00ad lized, a~d satanic'lI behavior in beating Fleanice and then dumping her body\": like raw sewage'! in .an abandoned buildi;ng. Dorinda Gray was sentenced to five years in prison for the 9harges she faced. -201-..... ~ .................... -----------..------~,.--~~-~-- ~--\u00ad 14 44' 44 /,~ \\ \" Fleanice died less than a month after the Grays were mar\u00ad ried. E. The Virginia Williams Family On January 11, 1981, eleven children perished in a fire in an East St. Louis home. Virginia Williams was the mother((,of the children; she had left them alone and unattended on the e\\rening of January 11 while she and her male companion went out gambling. Williams was charged with neglect and negotiated a plea agree\u00ad ment that resulted in a sentence of one year's probation. After the final hearing, Williams said, \"There's nothing I want to say, except I'm glad I'm not going to have to spend any time in prison.\" Ordinarily non-professionals do not consider child neglect to be as serious or severe as child abuse. This case, however, illustrates that the results of child neglect can be worse than those of abuse. The Department of Children and Family Services first became involved with the Williams family on April 13, 1977 I following ,If a report from the East St. Louis Po,lice Department that Virginia Williams' children were being left unsupervised in the home and had been seen begging for food. ;'from neighbors. A CPS caseworker on this date established the following service plan goals: ~s\u00ad tablish a child care plan for the children when the mother wa's' absent; assist with'housing pxoblems; and provide medical services when needed. Williams refused to accept homemaker services which had been offered by the DCFS workers. The DCFS file contains no indication of how these goals were addressed or whether they ever were met. On July 12, 1977, the East St. Louis police took temporary custody of all of the Williams children because they again were left unsupervised and were seen begg ing for food. After their\" return home, Williams failed to improve, and all of her children.) were placed in foster care after being ,left unsupervised on yet another occasion. DCFS custody, was terminated when Williams de\u00ad cided to move the entire familw to Mississippi. Documentation from the:, Department of Public';\"Welfare in that;. sta.;te indicates that, in November 1977, Williams refuqed to have her children innocu\u00ad lated and reportedly often left them without supervision or food. () \" 1/ On February 20, 1979, the Illinois Department of Public Aid vOt5 .. f ied DCFS that the Williams <family had returned to Illinois td\u00b7di had applied for publ~c aid at the East St$ Louis off.,ice. Mississippi authorities later told DCFS that Williams left the \"state the \" day before her cpildren were to be. placed in foster' care there. c. DCFS' first contact with Williams upon her\" return revealed that she was destitut'e c DCFS workers suggested that ,she have her children placed voluntarily until she could receive her first public aid check. She refused. \" II -202-~ I 1 I. I :1. I \\ o DCFS workers attempted to make ten home visits between Febru\u00ad ary 26, 1979, and June 12, 1979. Eight of these visits were suc\u00ad cessful; two were not. The family received emerge,ncy clothing and furniture, but again Williams refused homemaker services. The DCFS plan was to work with Williams on basic parenting and child care skills. A DCFS summary sta'tes that she appeared to be making strides in these areas. On June 12, 1979, Williams' landlord informed DCFS that the family had moved to Iowa on May 29, 1979. The Iowa Department of Social Services provided services to the family from September, 1979, to August, 1980. Apparently this agency insisted upon man\u00ad datory homemaker services and consistently monitored the home through caseworker visitation. Despite these precautions, the agency noted only marginal improvement in child care skills and continued negligence in the children's physical care, household safety, and medical follow-up. The Iowa Department of Social Ser\u00ad vices placed the eldest child, a daughter, with one of Williams' relatives in Mississippi due to an unexplained conflict between the child and Williams' current boyfriend. According to the Iowa Department of Social Services, \"It is possible that Williams left the Waterloo area to avoid what would have been a court referral and removal of her children if these problems persisted.\" On August 12, 1980, the family returned from Iowa to East St. Louis. Again the police recei.ved complaints that the chil\u00ad dren were unsupervised and begging for food. On August 26, 1980, Williams was arrested and charged with neglect. DCFS was called and a caseworker responded. While the worker did not view the Williams situation as one of \"severe neglect,\" it did seem serious enough to warrant follow-up services. The case was recorded as \"indicated neglect.\" The major problems identified on the DCFS report were the mother's unemployment; her financial problems; substandard hous ing; ana the mother:i's poor housekeep\u00ad ing skills. Williams refused to partiCipate in a birth control program but, finally, on October 23, 1980, she' agreed to a ser\u00ad vice plan that called for Headstart programs for three of the chil~ dren, medical care, clothing, furniture,' training in \"house;tlold functions,\" and vis\u00b7it,s from DCFS caseworkers twice a month. ,. Th~'~CFS list of phone contacts and home visits seems strin\u00ad gent; unlike some cases we have analyzed, visits to the Williams' home seem to have been maintained on a fairly regular, strict schedule. DCFS records reflect that when a caseworker made a home visit on December 109, 1980, there were approximately 15 children in her house and Williams was not home. An eleven-year-old daughter,., Jeannette, was in charge and, according to the worker, seemed to be in control of the situation. The worker noted the following in her report.: \"Although nob the best of circumstances\" I believe the children to be safe and had not known Mrs\" Williams to leave the children home alone in the past. I did plan, however, to dis\u00ad cuss the situation wth her.\" Apparently the worker was referring -20~-IX igi 4P to her own experiences with Williams and was disregarding the so\u00ad cial histOry of the mother, which indicated a clear pattern of non-supervision e The records we have reviewed describe progress toward ser\u00ad vice delivery for the family. The DCFS records note that no other neglect situations were discovered a.fter August 26, 1980, except for two occasions when Williams was founo not to be at home with the children. The final report states that the caseworker, Debbie Moffet, and the supervisor on the case, Vivian Sanders, \"were not aware of the mother leaving the children some evenings during the weekend, which became app~rent during the fatal fire.\" Again, apparently this refers to these two workers' personal experiences with the Williams family and disregards both the mother's history of neglect and a case record dated September 4, 1980, when a neigh\u00ad bor commented to DCFS workers that lithe mother is almost never homla and when she is, doesn't ca.re for them.\" The DCFS summary statement, prepared largely because of wide\u00ad spread suggestions that the Department had;\\. been remiss in not re\u00ad , moving the children from the home prior tO~,\\he fire, states: \\' \\~ Viewing the case in perspective of the intermittent contact that this agency had had with the family and considering the fact that both in 1979 and 1980 Mrs. Williams had apparently been cooperative in dealing with problems identified by DCFS, it is unreasonable to conclude that DCFS should have petitioned the Juvenile Court for removal of the children in the course of our contact in 1980. The DCFS documentation written after the fire states that there had been a great deal of improvement in the family situa\u00ad tion. This documentation indicates that the mother had shown pr9- gress in parenting, child care, and housekeeping skills, that tI1~\\i, children were attending school satisfactorily, that the children: I\" were healthy and well-fed, that DCFS had received no complaints , from community or police, and that th~/mot~er DCFS begin a full~scale investiga\u00ad tion because Williams had followlad (,the service plan. This para\u00ad graph also appears near the conclusion of thE3 reports, which are signed by Gordon Johnson, Deputy DirectOr for Program Operations: It is also my feeling that the worker Debby Moff~~t and Vivian Sanders acted properly in not requesting court intervention. The \"Juvenile Court Act requires a finding of imminent danger to the childrEm in order for the court to remove children from their parents at the point of a shelter care hearing. A simi\u00ad lar legal pre-condition is\" required for eith~r law enforcement officers [or] DCFSto take temporary custody. The Williams' \\, case does not qualify as one in imminent danger to the chil\u00ad dren. Therefore, the Service Plan to keep the children in the home can be supported. -204 .. \" '\" ~\" ~ .. I \" l' A comparison of the case summary with pribr case notes pOints out at least one discrepancy. In the case summary, Johnson states that a visit scheduled for December 19, 1980 was an unannounced visit. This was the visit at which 15 children were discovered in the home and Williams was absent. This is contradicted by a portion of a document titled \"Running Record\" submitted by the caseworker. The \"Running Record\" contains a reference to December 18 1980 and reads as follows: ~I told Mrs. Williams about the th~istma~ basket being requested and that I would bring it over the next afternoon to give it and gifts to the children.\" Obviously, the next day's visit was not unannounced, and the caseworker should have known that the mothe~ absence was a sign that she was not following her service plan to provide adequate supervision for her children. If the mother could not even be home when the case\u00ad worker was expected to visit, who could logically assume that'she was home on other occasions? On January 11, 1981, Virginia Williams was 28 years old. Her 12 children ranged in age from eight months to 13 years, 11 of whom perished in the fire. (The 13-year-old was in foster care in Mississippi.) Sergeant Gregory Cox of the East St. Louis Police Department told us that he had numerous encounters with Williams, including \"two arrests for child neglect. Cox told us that twice the chil\u00ad dren were placed in f~\"ster care because of th~ neglect: He added that the mother appeared to have no interest J.n her chJ.ldren. He described her as a compulsive gambler who borrowed money from friends to gamble, and that Williams was known to have gambled away money that she had borrowed at a 25% or even 100% interest rate promising to pay back \"a dollar for a dollar.\" Cox told us that Williams was known to gamble a\"\"lay her entire public aid check and that the children went without food as a result. Cox said that the fire started from a space heater located on the first floor of an old two-story house. All of the bedrooms were on the second, floor and all of the children were trapped either in the bedrooms or on, the stairwell.' Cox said that if the chil~ dren had not died in the fire, fumes from the clogged space heater would have killed them anyway. Cox said that one good thing had come from the Williams in\u00ad cident: prior to the fire, the police did not trust DCFp workers and the workers did not trust the police. They were reluctant to share information. Now, however, Cox said that the Williams' tragedy has provided a bridge for them to resolve their suspicions and difficulties. They realize the different functions of the other agency and have begun to coo1?erate, so ,that each ~ne can do the best job. The police have admJ.tted theJ.r shortcomJ.ngs, as have DCFS workers. In September, 1981, Commission inve~tigators interviewed Virginia Williams at her home in East 'St. Louis. Sgt. Cox aC90m\u00ad panied them to her home, where she agreed to be interviewed./;/ -205-i, , \\ \\ , A $jig we Williams told us she was born and raised in Mississippi. By 1976 she had given birth to seven of her children. She said that she was receiving an insufficient amount of money from the state so she began gambling. State welfare authorities found out about the gambling and threatened action against her and her children. On the advice of her brother, who lived in Eas~ St. Louis she moved to Illinois in 1976. As soon as she arr~ved she appli~d for and was granted public aid in the amount of $~O~ per month, a substantial increase over what she had been rece~v~ng in Mississippi. Williams told us that she remembered her first contact with DCFS as occurring sometime in 1977. She told us that the East St. Louis police had received a call from someone alleging tha7 she had left her children home alone; the children were taken ~nto custody and Williams had to go to cour~. W~lli'7ms.cl'7im:d that she had been visiting friends or relat~ves ~n M~SS~ss~pp~ when this call came in and that she had left the children in the care of a htgh school girl, who, she said, had left them alone. . Williams added that the judge told her when she a~peared at the hearing that she should move back to Mississippi because s~e h~d relatives there who could help her with her finances and w~th ner children. Williams did move back to Mississippi in 1977 and. stayed there until 1979. Then Williams said, the man who had fathered several of her younger ch1.1dren, Will Arthur Jones (who is married with five children of his own), came to Mississippi and moved the en\u00ad tire Williams family to his home in Waterloo, Iowa. In Iowa, . Williams again applied for public assistance and was granted $804 per month. By this time she had twelve children. Williams told us that the Iowa Department of Children and Family Services pro\u00ad vided homemaker services and was interested in the health and we~l-,. being of all of the children. When we'asked how the Iowa au~ho::~-!';:, ties became involved with her family, she responded that Ill~no~s-~ DCFS notified the Iowa authorities of her whereabouts and past association with DCFS. She added that the Iowa authorities had become concerned with the welfare of the children after one of her children lost vision in one eye following an accident. Next Williams moved her children back to Illinois, around october of 1980. When she first arrived, she found it necessary to live with others, so she and her twelve children moved in with friends who had five or six children of their own. Williams said that because the home was so overcrowded, the police were called and her children were placed until she could find adE:')quate hous\u00ad ing for them. What she found was a house provided by a friend of Will Arthur Jonese Investigators asked Williams about the homemaker services that had b~en provided by Iowa authorities, since she had refused similar services in 'Illinois. Williams responded that she never knew what the Illinois caseworkers were talking about when they referred to homemaker services; she did not kn9w what the term meant or impl.ied. So she refused the services becauSe she did -206-l , , ,I. I ~i \\ h I} f~ I 1\\ not know what they were, she said. She added that had she known what they consisted of, she gladly would have accepted them. Williams described the events that led to her discovery of her children's deaths. She left home about two o!clock in the afternoon with her friend Jones and spent some time in St. Louis visiting friends and playing cards. They returned to East St. Louis sometime that night, whereupon they went to a friend's home to play more cards. She said that Jones would periodically leave and drive by her house to \"check on the children,\" though he never went in. After his last such trip, he returned to his friend's home about three o'clock in the morning where Williams was still playing cards. Williams said that he was incoherent when he walked in the door but eventually was able to say, \"All of the children have been burned up.\" Williams told us that she had someone drive her to her home, where she saw firemen trying;', to put out the fire. That 'was all that she rememhl':\"'~d; she told us that someone informed her later that she faintaA,,:a.t the scene of the fire. She added that she had been told that the firemen had done nothing to save the chil\u00ad dren and that it had taken them a very long time to respond to the initial call. Williams was adamant that she had done nothing wrong. She said that the 11-year-old who took care of the rest of the chil\u00ad dren was quite capable of disciplining the children, cooking, and managing the household. Williams said that had she herself been in the home when the fire occurred, undoubtedly she also would have been killed. On February 11, 1982, Judge Kenneth Juen discharged Williams from probation during a brief court hearing, saying\" \"The mere fact you are no longer under the supervis ion of this cour,t doesn't mean you can s l,;i.p back in [to] your old ways.\" He warned her that she probably would lose all rights to her new child if she ever were charged with neglect again. Williams was pregnant at the time of the fire, and she gave birth to a son during the time she was on probation. Williams gave birth to yet another son during the late sqrnrner of 1982. DCFS had been monitoring this case during this entire period. On September 2,2; 1982, a nurse from the Visiting Nurses Asso\u00ad c~ation ca.lled on Williams at her home to .check on Williams' 14- month-old son (she was unaware that there were actualJ;y.\u00b7two in\u00ad fants in the home). There was no response to hE3X knock on the door, so. the nurse waited outside in the hope that someone would rE:'!turn soon. Aftei about 45 minutes, Williams returned t9 the home, and i.nvited the nurse in. OncE:'! inside the house, the nurse observed that an electr'ic space heater was plugged in and that the burners on the kitchen range were on. She stated that the house was extremely hot and uncomfortable. When William$ fetched her two infants for the -207-1 ,. Fa 44 g ... t~-------------- nurse's examination, the nurse noted that they both were perspir\u00ad ing heavily and appeared to be experiencing great discomfort be\u00ad cause of the extreme heat. The nurse notified PCFS of the incident the next day, and the two infants have been in foster care since an abbreviated shel\u00ad ter care hearing was held September 24, 1982. At a rehearing on DCFS' request for shelter care, held October 15, 19182, Williams and her boyfriend both testified that the children were not left alone, and that the boyfriend was tending them. (Apparently, the contention is that the boyfriend was at home during Williams' ab\u00ad sence and the nurse's visit but did not want to be seen so remained hidden.) Despite this testimony, St. Clair County Juvenile Court ~udge Milton Wharton ruled there was still probable cause that the two boys had been left unattended. At the october 15 hearing, Williams said she will \"never for\u00ad get\" her 11 unattended children who died in the 1981 fire. \"God has blessed me with two more sons and I won't do nothing to hurt them,\" she -cold Judge Wharton. Williams' lawyer, Maripn Goldenhersh, said in court that the complaint was filed because of \"overreaction and oversuspicion about this lady.\" At a full hearing held on October 27, 1982, Judge Wharton entered a finding of neglect, then ordered the two boys made wards of 'the court. DCFS is to make a social study for the court be\u00ad fore a disposition hearing set for November 30 (subsequent to the time this report is being written). The visiting nurse testified at the October 27 hearing that she and Williams were in the house about an hour before she ever saw the bdyfrienq., who appeared at the front door. Criminal charges of child neglect (Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 23, .2361) are also pending against Williams. 'I :');1 There appear to be few questions about this case. The 'mother clearly neglected her children and moved from 'state to state when threatened by child welfare authorities. \" For whatever reasons, ,\u00ad she refused services in Illinois. For supposed religious reasons, she refused to participate in birth control programs. Of her 14 children, 11 are dead, one remains in foster care in Mississippi\" and two are in the custody of DC,FS. What is most notable about this case is its implication of the seriousness of neglect, as well as the ability of a person to elude and. avoid the authorities. If the mother had been a severe child abuser, perhaps more of an effort to\u00b7 treat her would have been made by state authorities; J;>erhaps the police would have been called in more often. But generally ~ven child protection profes- ~. sionals labor under the illusion thatQneglect can ha~e a long~term effect on children but cannot be 'immediately damaging t9 them. This case proves otherwise. -208-\" ' \"Fi :,,' ~ f: t i '\\ ~ f' t' t ' I ; ! 1 , ~ ! t i I '. ., F. Peter Peter's case came to our attention during a routine inter\u00ad view of Assistant Cook County Medical Examiner Robert H. Kirschner. He told us that Peter had died of salt poisoning at Loyola Medi.cal Center in June, 1980, and that he may have been abused. He added that authorities were not pursuing the case. Commission investi\u00ad gators then conducted interviews and reviewed records, to con\u00ad struct the following chronology of events leading to Peter's death. Peter was born several weeks prematurely on July 28, 1977, at St. \"Therese's Hospital in Waukegan, and was transferred to Evanston Hospital a few days later. Pet~x:developed meningitis and, later, hydrocephalus, an abnormal increase in the amount of fluid in the cranium which, ifl.m-Sreated, causes enlargement of the head and destruction of the brain. Peter was operated on by a surgeon in the Pediatrics Department. The surgery involved insertion of a small synthetic tube, a \"shunt,\" into Peter's cranium. This shunt drained excess fluid into Peter's abdomen. Peter's surgery was performed on August 2, 1977; he stayed at Evanston Hospital until October 27, 1977. The operating sur\u00ad geon could not recall ever seeing the parents visit Peter, but att+ibuted this to the considerable distance between Antioch (where they lived at that time) and Evanston. When Peter was discharged, his parents were advised to bring him back for an examination in one month. They failed to do so. According to the surgeon, Peter's examination would have in\u00ad cluded checking the shunt to ensure that it was functioning pro\u00ad per~y and that Peter had not outgrown it. He told us that because of the, hydrocephalic condition, Peter would develop SlO\\,lly during his fi,rst six to nine months but would develop normally after that. On his release from the hospital, every indication was that Peter would be able to lead a relatively normal life. Peter's family doctor told us that the parents had brought Peter in on November 9 and December 8, 1977. He said that these had been:r:'outine office visits to check Peter's height, weight, and general conq.ition. He had not chebked the shunt because he was a general practitioner,not .~ specialist; he felt that t,he doctOr who had implanted the shunt or a similar specialist should check it for effectiveness. Peter had an appOintment for January 27, 1978, which was not kept, and another for February 2, 1978, which was. That was the last time he saw Peter or his family. Officials at\" the Lake County Health Department told us that between September, 1977 and June, 1979, a public health nurse made regular home and telephone contacts with Peter's parents. The hospital had :;-outinely forwarded Pet.er' s records to the depart..,.,. ment because he was premature, antiCipating -the need for medical follow-up. All of the Departm~nt' s\" records indicate that the par\u00ad ents w'ere providing Peter with proper diet and care. The Depart- -209- \" Q\u00a7 *4 ii' mentis role in the case, however, was quite limited and ended when Peter's family moved to Villa Park (i.n DuPage County). On October 10 1979, DCFS received a telephone report concern\u00ad ing the alleged neglect of two-year-old Peter and his one-year-old sister, Paula. Paula was a norma~healthy child and the caller's only remarks about her were that she seemed extremely overweight for a child her age and that she probably was not receiving pro\u00ad per medical attention (shots, etc.). The caller told DCFS that Peter was unable to walk or talk, receiving no medical care, fed only strained baby food, and confined to his bedroom at all times. We interviewed, the caller (whose identity cannot be revealed) to find out why he had filed a report on Peter's parents. \"He told us that although he was not extremely close to the parents, he felt ,.that they were ashamed of Peter. Whenever Peter's na~e would come up in conversation, they always responded that they d~d not feel like talking about him. 'l'he source descr ibed the /t)arent 's backgrounds. When he made the report to DCFS, the mot:h-gr\u00b7was about 21 and the father was about 29. Allegedly, the father physically abused his wife; they had even separated briefly because of these beatings. The source listed several allegations about Peter's father, perhaps the most significant of which concerned his abnormall~ secretive natur7. , Never allowing his wife to go anywhere, he d~d\"~~l of the fam~ly s grocery shopping and even r'efused to le,t her answer the door when he was not home. Supposedly, the father's parents had abused him when he was a child, and he eventually spent time in the Juvenile Division of the Department of Corrections. Finally, the source told us that the father had a very bad attitude about Peter, and had said he wished Peter had been a girl. DCFS caseworker Mary Ellen McIntyre had taken the source's :: initial call and was assigned the case by her supervisor. She '/ went to the horne the day after the call, but found no one at home until a week later on October 17, 1979, when she interviewed P~ter's parents. McIntyre told us that Peter's parents were both quite hO,stile toward her and refused to let her enter the home until she threat\u00ad ened to call the police: children. She~Giiierr.bered noth~ng unusual about either child. Peter's mother showed MCIntyre his shunt and a copy of his special diet, and explained the complexi\u00ad ties of Peter's roedtcal condition. The mother told McIntyre that they had just moved to Villa'Park, and had not yet had ~ chance to find a local doctor. She also stated that Peter needed no spe\u00ad cial medical attention unless he became \"extremely\" sick. McIntyre left the telephone number of the local public health facility at the apartment. After leaving the home, McIntyre called the re\u00ad porting source'and told him to call DCFS again if anything unusual developed. She then designat'ed the case \"unfounded\" and closeq it. t1 f~ fi ~ '1 ,~ f t We learned later that Paula had been seen at the Villa Park Medical Center on three separate occasions for routine purposes, but that Peter had not been brought there at all. </ At 6: 00 p.m. on June 9, 1980--almost 'eight months after the DCFS visit to Peter's home--paramedics took Peter to Elmhurst Memorial Hospital. Peter was in a coma, suffering from, among other things, a non-functioning shunt, head trauma, and hyperna\u00ad tremia (salt poisoning). Because Loyola Medtcal Center in Maywood was better equipped to handle such a case, Peter was transferred the~e in critical condition. Before the transfer, however, the pol~ce were called in to fill out an initial report. On June 11, 1980, at 2:30 a.m.--less than a day and a half after he was brought to Elmhurst Memorial--Peter died. He was not quite three years old. Loyola Medical Center notified the Cook County Medical Ex\u00ad aminer's office of Peter's death. Assistant Cook County Medical Examiner Robert H. Kirschner performed an autopsy on the morning of Peter's death. A portion of his post-mortem report follows: This 35 month old white male was brought to the Hospital in a comatose state. The parents related a history of a fall from his crib. The child was admitted to the hospital but died ap\u00ad proximately 24 hours later. At autopsy, there is minimal evi\u00ad dence of trauma to the head. There are, however, old and recent \u00a3ractures of the limbs char\u00ad acteristic of child abuse. The injuries of the legs are such that the child probably would not be able to stand, due to the pain associated with the fractures. The parents' story is in\u00ad consistent with the multiple, repetitive injuries suffered by this child. The recent head injuries were either directly inflicted or occurred as a direct consequence of the other in\u00ad j,,,-ries to the body. ~e etiology of the hypernatremia and hyperchloridemia is ob\u00ad greatly elevated levels of these electrolytes sug\u00ad gests that this child may have been, fed large amounts of table salt. Salt Toxicity would potentiate seizure activity and cere\u00adbral coma. MAImER OF DEATH: HOMICIDE An attached radiological report done at Cook County Hospital as a consultation lists three \"impressions\" of the radiologist. The first is simply \"battered child.\" It should be noted that this post-mortem report was not pre\u00ad pared until a number of tests were completed several months later. Until all oftllese test;s were completed, the cause of death offi\u00ad cially was \"undetermined.\" (Kirsch1}er told us that his report was also delayed because he had trouble gettiJlg information from the involved hospitals and others.) Immediat~ely after completing the autopsy, however, Dr. Kirschner did suspect homicide and con-(I .. -211-pa 44 a, .. tacted Detective Andrew D. Subject of the Villa Park Police Depart\u00ad ment. The DuPage County State'~ Attorney's Office also became aware of this case at that time, although (for reasons to be ex\u00ad plained later) their investigation of Peter's death did not begin until January, 1981. On the day of Peter's death, then, Detective Subject and Detec\u00ad tive Lieutenant Dennis Miller questioned both parents after giving them Miranda warnings. The parents told the police their version of what had hap\u00ad pened. On June 9, 1980, at approximately 4:00 p.m., the mother fed Peter a~d, as was her normal practice, put him back in his crib. Shortly thereafter, she heard a \"thump I; and went to Peter's room, where she ,found him on the floor \"in a daz ed cond it ion~' II She said that Peter was not crying and she noted no physical signs of injury, so she put him back in the crib anJ left the room. Five minutes later, she went back to check on him and found him vomiting, clenching his teeth, and rolling his eyes back into his head. At about this time (4:4S p.m.), the father arrived home from work and decided to drive Peter to Elmhurst Memorial Hospital. Because of Peter's obviously worsening condition, he stopped en route and called paramedics, who transported Peter to the hospi\u00ad tal. The parents said they remembered two or possibly three pre\u00ad vious occasions when Peter had fallen from his crib. They said that one side of Peter's crib malfunctioned from time to time, and they assumed that this is what happened the afternoon Peter had to be taken to the hospital. \u00b7t Both parent~ denied ever physically abusing or otherwise h6.rsh\u00ad ly punishing Peter. They stated that their on,ly punishment f.or him was slapping his hands, which seemed to be effective. They also said they rarely went out socially but when they did, their only b~bysitters were the mother's parents, who lived in another DuPage County suburb. To learn more about the extent of Peter's injuries, we con\u00ad sulted Dr. Kirschner and another, outside medical authority. Dr. Kirschner gave us copies of all reports that he had completed con\u00ad cerning Peter's death. ,He told us that the immed'iate cause of death was salt po i:soning , and that if there had \"been no other signs of abuse, he would have classified the cause of death as \"uncer\u00ad tain.1I However, the multiple fractures and bruises that Peter had sustained were a clear sign of abuse. Dr. Kirschner .said that Peter had four separate fra9tures-\u00ad his right arm and both of'l:lis legs had been brok,en. Each frac\u00ad ture was at a different stage of healing, indicating that each\" had occurred separately. Also, at least,five nruises Had been detected on Peter's legs and feet.. Like the fractures , the Ii bruises were old and' in the process of healing when Peter ,.d.ied. -212-f , I ~ n \" ! 1 I I \" #. :1 \\ I i I Neither the fractures nor the bruises could be attributed to a recent fall from a crib, as Peter's parents had suggested. Also, Dr. Kirschner found no \"visible sign:s of injuryll to Peter's contradicted the parents' explanation of Peter's comatose state: that he had fallen from his crib and hit his head. Over 30 grams of salt were found in Peter's blood. We asked Dr. Kirschner if there were any way that the salt could have been eaten by accident or through an improper diet. He responded that it was possible that the parents could have mixed the salt with the child's f.ood, but they would have had to be aware that they were giving him so much salt that he would be poisoned. Apparently, there is no way Peter could have ingested so much salt on his own. For one thing, if Peter had eaten 30 grams of salt at once, he would have vomited it befcre it reached his blood\u00ad stream. Moreover, Dr. Kirschner told us-that Peter's fractures would have kept him in constant pain, rendering him incapable .of standing .on his .own, let alone walking to the table salt. Dr. Kirschner felt that the injuries were typical child abuse symptoms; in most child abuse cases, he explained, the parents do not attempt to kill their child but try to inflict extreme pun\u00ad ishment for real or imagined acts. He ccncluded by 5,tating he was willing to give his opinions \"with reasonable medical certainty\" as testimony. The independent medical expert we consulted was Rute Medenis, M.D., Associate Professor of Pediatrics at the University .of Illi\u00ad nois Medical Center. We furnished Dr. Medenis with Dr. Kirschner'S reports and' subpoenaed medical records from all of the h.ospitals 'that we knew had treated Peter: St. Therese's Hospital, Evanstcn Hospital, Elmhurst Memorial Hospital, and Loyola Medical Center. After reading the reports, Dr. Medenis commented: \"That kid must have been a punching bag for someb.ody.1I pr. Medenis agreed with Dr. Kirschner that Peter must have been in constant pain from the fractures of his limbs. She said that it would have been impossible for anyone to have stood up with a fracture like Peter's--locc;.ted'both above and below the knee. She also explained that bleeding in Peter's head had oc\u00ad curred on both sides, which is consistent with the effects of salt pciscning and inconsistent with a blcw to the head or fall from a crib, which wculd have produced bleeding in .one area .only. Dr. Medenis told us that she has inserted shunts into chil\u00ad dren's heads and that it is essential that they be checked perio\u00ad dically to see if the child has outgrown the shunt, in which case it would have been ineffective in draining off fluids near the brain. peter clearly had outgrown his shunt, she said'. Dr. Medenis said that this case ''laS a \"classic\" child abuse case and that it \\'la:S obvious from the evidence that Peter had been a~used unt'il he died.\" She said that the case was typical insofar as abusive parents often will choose .one child in the family to '~ -213- ~, . .... '-a QU ; 4Q2 ~ 1 I ! ~ I abuse and leave the others alone. Frequently the child chosen is \"different\" in some way, or is not \"normal.1I She argued that, at the very least, Peter's parents' inattention to his medical condition indicated child neglect. Dr. Medenis also showed us a chart of average height and weight for a child of Peter's age. Peter was grossly unde,rweight at the time of his death, even tak\u00ad ing into consideration his medica~~problems. Dr. Medenis said that there are several medical conditions which can cause salt to accumulate in the body, including a spe\u00ad cific type of head injury in which the brain will shut off the normal flow of instructions to other parts of the body that eli\u00ad minate excess salt. If this were the case, the body would be un\u00ad able to eliminate the salt, causing coma or cardiac arrest. How\u00ad ever, nothing in any of the medical records even suggested that Peter had this or any other condition that could have been a IInaturalll cause of salt retention. Dr. Medenis said that there was one indis\u00ad putable fact concerning the presence of this amount of salt in Peter's body, regardless of whether Peter had collected the salt by force or by accident: he would have had to be deathly ill for at least three days before he was brought to the hospital, and it was more likely that he would have been extremely sick for about seven days before his death, because it takes a certain period of time for salt to accumulate in the body. Therefore, Peter would have had to have been vomiting, convulsing, or shoWing some other signs of extreme illness long before his parents took him to the hospital for treatment. Because there was' some confusion over who was supposed to report Peter's death to DCFS (which we will describe later in this' account), DCFS did not learn of the incident until November 7, 1980, five months after Peter died. The DCFS record states that a report could not be initiated at that time \"e:s child was dead five months prior to the report to DCFS.\" DCFS did open a case, howev~r, apparently for two reasons: (1) follow-up on Peter's sister; Paula, and (2) documentation of the events leading to Peter's death. After some difficulty in locating the family, the DCFS worker finally found the right address and apartment, and left a note asking the parents to call DCFS. The father\u00b7 did so on November 20, 1980, expressing his surprise at being contacted. He said that he and his wife had spoken ,'lith the police and that they thought the matter had been closed. The socj.al worker taking the call noted that the father was quite evasive and obviously did not want to meet with her. The father said that the worker would have to talk to his wife because he worked six days a week from 5:00 a.m\" until after 11:00 p.m.; further, his wife IIwas away\" and would not return for a few days. He would not say where she had gone. Finally, they set up an appointment for November 24, 1980, the father claiming that this was the earliest his wife could meet with the social worker. '. On this Same date, the social worker spo~e with a representa\u00ad tive of told the worke;r -214-I I I t ~ \" \", ., ~, r that he thought the case was being investigated and that he would get back to the socic:-l worker about the case's status. The''<'.!orker also contacted the V~lla Park police, who initially agreed to' send DCFS a copy of the police report but later recanted stating that the report could be submitted to DCFS only upon rec~ipt of a written n\u00b7~9uest or a subI;0ena. A DCFS social worker viSited the mother and Paula on November 24, 1980. Her initial observation was that the home was spotless and that the mother and Paula communicated well together. DCFS case records include the mother'S version of what occurred on June 10, 1980, the day before Peter's death: [The mother) spoke in a quiet tone and began on the afternoon of 6~10/80. [Paula and Peter) were in the kitchen. [The mother) was 1n the bathroom. When she returned to the kitchen she found the salt shaker had been opened. [The mother) presumed [Paulal had opened it. There was salt allover the table and floor and on [Peter). She did not see hini eating any salt but just to be safe, she gave him water and some peptoBismol.' He ap\u00ad peared fine. Approximately 1~ hours later, she fed [peter). He ate and drank some milk. She then put him in his crib for a nap. A short while later she heard a noise as though he had fallen. She opened the door and found him on the floor face do\\m, ge\\:ting to his knees. She stated that the bar on' the c:ib ~ust have given way. She indicated that she thought he h~t h~s head on the dresser. He was whining rather than cry- jng which is the sound that he usually made when upset. [The mother] stated that she held him for awhile and he seemed to be alright. She placed him back into bed and returned to the kitchen to feed [Paula). She then heard [Peter] vomiting. She went to his room and found him shaking as though he had the chills. She tried .to hold him and he didn't want to be held. He continued to vomit violently for about 20 minutes She laid him on the\"floor when it seemed he had stopped and\u00b7 changed his clothes and sheets. She returned him to his bed He tried to pick his head up but didn't seem to have control\u00b7 of his head. He began to vomit again. She again cleaned him up and changed the sheets. This took approximately 30 minutes. [~eter] then began to kick and jerk his body and arms and head. H~s eyes opened and rolled back. [The mother] stated she didn't know what to do as she had no phone. Hex' husband came home shortly thereafter and put [Peter] in the car,' and proceeded .' to Elmhurst Hospital. [The mother] stayed at home with [Paulal. v On the way to the hospital, [Peterl wor~.ened and began jerking and acted as though he could not breathe. [The father] pulled over and called for an ambulance. [Peter] had stopped breath\u00ad ing but he was still alive when he arrived at Elmhurst Hospital. The mother was later transported to the hospital by her parents. She remem1?ered being told by a doctor that Peter had had an epi\u00ad leptic se~zure and that he ne'eded to have the shunt removed be\u00ad cause it had come out of his stomach. She remembered a doctcr asking what Peter had eaten recently and she had gone home to bring in his baby foods for testing. The mother remembered doctors dis- -215-IX 44 44 i ~ ,_ ... cussing why Peter had died; she recalle\u00a2l that one had thought it was the result of a brain tumor, while another thought that it had been sugar diabetes. Still another mentioned Reye's Syndrome. The report states the motherfs belief that \"They were never clear about how or why he actually died.\" The mother told the social worker that Peter was development\u00adally delayed but that they had been told to expect that. She said that he never walked on his own; he walked by holding onto things He had been able to stand alone for only two months before his death. She also told the social worker that the doctors had said tha~ no follow-up care was necessary unless Peter showed signs of J.llness. The following two paragraphs are taken verbatim from the DCFS report: Social worker asked [the mother] why [Peter] had bruises on his body at the time of death. [She] said he used to kick his high chair and hit his head on the back. of his crib. Whenever he wanted attention, he would hit his head and [the mother] would respond by picking him up or at least go to him. Social worker asked if [Peter] had ever had any broken bones and [the mother] claimed to have no knowledge of this. In the course of the conversation, [the mother] mentioned that a DCFS worker from the Villa Park office had been out about ~ year ago. She explained that someone called anonymously claim\u00ad ~g the~ were not feeding their children and were not provid- Lng med~cal treatment. She remembered telling the caseworker that she would follow up on immunizations for both chidren and still had not done so. [The mother] was afraid of losing [Paula] because of this. The mother remembered that the first report had accused her of never allowing the children out of the bedroom but when the social worker arrived, all of. the children were in th~ living room (one might recall that the worker was allowed in only after she threat\u00adened to call the police). Later.the social worker learned, ;in conversation with DuPage County AssJ.stant State's Attorney Cynthia Lee Wheeler whose of\u00ad fice ~as investigating the case, that the mother had ~ot mentioned anythJ.ng about the salt i~cident to the State's Attorney's inves1ti\u00ad gator. Wheeler wondered J.f the mother had changed her story based\" on what s,he heard at the hospital. . ~ On the DCFS social worker's fourth visit to the horne on J.an\u00ad u~ry ~~', 1981, she finally met the, father. He strongly s~pported hJ.s wJ.fe s account of the events that led to Peter's death and was.ver~ c?operative with the social worker, Both parents'expressed theJ.r wJ.IIJ.ngnes~7to cooperate with DCFS in order to ensure welfare, \"short dif removing her from the horne.\" ~216----~ ---- On February 19, 1981, the day on which the story of Peter's death appeared in a local newspaper, the worker made another home visit. Specifically mentioning Peter's fractures, the worker ad\u00ad vised both parents that a finding of \"indicated child abuse\" would be recorded. Neither parent rnadeany comment or asked any ques\u00ad tions. The worker learned at this meeting that the mother had agreed with the Sta~e's Attorney's Office to undergo a polygraph examination. The father became upset and expressed his distrust of the .. system. \" 'l'he mother expressed her intention of cancelling her appOintment with the State's Attorney's investigators, but after discussing the matter with the worker, stated that she would think it over. Following these meetings,,, the worker wrote a report which included recommendations regarding Paula: This social worker has found no indication of any abuse or neg\u00ad lect on [Paulal. Had social worker been involve.d immedi~tely after [Peter1s] death, this might have been a different reac\u00ad tion an.d another plan might have been recommended. ,.However, coming into the case after a child had been dead for 5 months and seeing the second child well cared for and happy, social worker is not recommending placement at this time. Social worker has talked with Cindy Wheeler, State's Attomey, and they, too, could find no reason to remove [Paula] from the home. Social worker does recommend follow up in the form of supervi\u00ad sion at this time as the family ;ls not feeling any need for serv!ces. A finding of abuse on [Peter] was made on February 19, 1981. The case will be held in the Protective Service Unit for fol\u00ad low up on [Paula]. The news story in the local paper highlighted the fact that tl1e DuPage County State's AttOrIlf,!Y' s Office di\u00a2l not begin investi\u00ad gating peter's death until January, 1981, even though the Villa Park Police had notified the office of his ,death shortly after its occurrence. The story further stated that both Elmhurst Hos\u00adpital and Loyola University Medical Center failed to report the case as suspected abuse or neglect, and DCFS offiCials did. not learn of Peter's death and the Circumstances surrounding it until they conducted a routine check of Loyola's records, looking for suspect~d abuse cases that might not have been reported. \"The story said that ~T. Mi.~hael Fitzsimmons, DuPage County if State's At'torney, acknowledged his office's knowledge 9f the death (\\ since June., 1980, but said that his investigation was delayed be-\" cause the child was transferred fro~ a DuPage County hospital to a Cook County hospital. Furthermore, the autopsy wa$, pe~forrned by the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office, delaying transferral of records until January, when his office began its inv~\u00a7tigation, Fitzsimmons said. -217--A 4\u00a3 JQ if ~\"\".' representatives of the DUPage County State's Attbrney's Office on an ongoing basis, be\u00ad ginning in April, 1981. Two representatives of the office, Wheeler (mentioned earlier) and Criminal Division Chief Thomas L. Knight, along with other members of the staff, eventually concluded that it would be virtually impossible to convict anyone of poisoning Peter with salt. They felt that Peter's fractures and bruises, as well as his medical neglect, would have been sufficient to re\u00ad move him from the home had he still been alive and possibly even to seek termination of parental rights. But they believed that the fractures, bruises, and medical neglect would not aid in any prosecution for Peter's death due to salt poisoning. Knight's reasoning was based on case law he interpreted as prohibiting the introduction at trial of evidence of conduct by the accused not relevant to the actual, specific cause of death. (That is, only conduct illustrative of certain modus operandi would be admissible into evidence.) An investigator also spoke with Cook County Assistant State's Attorneys Kathleen Ryan,and Timothy McMahon. Ryan's assessment of the case records was that this would be a tough case to prose\u00ad cute successfully because of the salt\". However, she recommended that the case nevertheless be prosecuted: she commented that the medical evidence from two experts was overwhelming and that the pattern of abuse was chronic. Further, the paren'ts I stories were inconsistent enough to erase doubts in her mind about their cul\u00ad pability. While we wanted to interview Peter's parents to complete this case study, we were hesitant to do so because of the possibility-\u00ad however slight--that the DuPage County State's Attorney's Office might reverse itself and prosecute either or both parents for Peter's death or some lesser charge. We sought their advice; in response,:, we received a letter from Knight stating that his office had no 'I intention of prosecuting the case because of insufficient evidence. In a later conversation, before the parents were interviewed, Knight told us that his office would bring cha.rges against one or both parents, if they confessed. If the confession contained an admis\u00ad sion that Peter was force-fed salt, Knight would prqceed on murder charges; if the admission concerned only the fractures and bruises, he would pursue ch?rges of aggravated battery. We discovered t.hatPeter' s parents, with Faula, had moved from Villa Park to a Lake County suburb. We ,arranged to meet with Peter's ~other at a Lake County hospital, where her husband was undergoing minor surgery. We in~erviewed the motlier on, December 31,1981. She told us that she h~d been very young when she married and became preg\u00ad nant in her first year of marriage. During her pregnancy and throughout the marriage, her husband drank excessively and used drugs. Often he was fired or laid off so there was not enough money to go around. 'When he was working, it was at night. He spent his days off with friends instead of -218-~' ~~ t- l tl'> , / \\ ~. , i \" ,~ ~ ~ I t !i \" Ii \" IJ 1 i1 .j '. .~ \u00b71 , , , I his wife and children and sometimes spent weeks away from home. Because her husband did not allow her to go out or have any friends, ,she had no one to talk to about her problems. Her husband did not want to give Peter any special \"medical care; the one time she suggested taking him to a group such as one sponsored by Easter Seals, the husband refused. She admitted that when the family's monetary problems and other marital pressures got to her, she would take her frustrat\u00ad ion Qut on Peter. This became acute after Paula was born, and she had a normal, healthy baby with whom to compare Peter. While Paula might cry occasionally, P~ter whined and whimpered almost constantly, sometimes all night long. Near the end of the interView, she admitted to spanking Peter and screaming at him to get him to stop whining. When that did not\" work, she would grab his arms or legs and twist them as hard as she could. When he started to cry, she realized what she had done but never really understood why she had done it. She agreed to sign a statement that sun~arized her actions toward Peter, which she did, and said she felt better having finally discussed the matter with someone. She continued to maintain j however, that Peter must have in\u00ad gested the salt accidentally. The mother said that she never told her husband about hurting Peter unt.il after PlSter had died and Villa Park police questioned him at work about Peter's injuries. She said that to the best of her knowledge, her husband had never hurt Peter. The purpose of the Commission in conducting this investiga\u00ad tion had been made clear to Peter's mother; she understood that she had not been subpoenaed and that any information she gave us was given voluntarily. She did say that she did not understand why she had hurt her son, and expressed an apparently sincere de\u00ad sire to talk to a professional about it. At the time this report is being written, the DuPage County State's Attorney's Office has taken no further action on this case. Aft~r our interview with the mother, she underwent counseling, which apparent~y was successful, according to the counselor. Systemic Problems During our investigation of Peter's death, we interviewed several professionals who described general systemic problems that go beyo?d this one case. DuPage County Assistant State's Attorney Cynthia Lee Wheeler was quite critical of DCFS, charging that at times DCFS staff had withheld files from her off ice \"in order to \"protect their clients.\" Wheeler said that DCFS did not cooperate or work with her office on cases at' a'll. Wheeler's analysis of were interested in their individual clients, while staff at the State's Attorney's Office were charged with being respon\u00ad sible for the \"public good.\" Wheeler felt that this basic con\u00adflict might always keep the two from cooperating. Wheeler said that the only cases that DCFS reported to her office were \"head\u00ad line grabbers\" and cases needing police support and protection. Thomas L. Knight agreed with Wheeler, and said that in his eleven years of prosecuting cases, he has seen DCFS fight court ,recommendations and decisions. DuPage County Assistant State's Attorneys Victoria A. Rossetti and Patrick J. King, Jr.! commented on issues dealing with child abuse and neglect prosecutions. Rossetti and King mentioned that their office established its own screening committee to divide calls and categorize cases. County hospitals an9 local police departments had been calling their office directly rather than attempting to call DCFS. They sai9 that these mandated reporters ignore the law because they feel that they will get no. results ',' if they call DC~S . King said the situation was so bad that ASAs even get calls at home. Rossetti said that the root of the conflict with DCFS was internal conflict within DCFS as a result of trying to both in\u00ad vestigate suspected cases and also provide tr~atment to the ~bu\u00ad sive families. She added tnat DCFS is not always uncooperat1ve With her office but that inconsistency besb)decribes the DCFS i 1/ initiative toward King thnt DCFS has at times open~y refused to prov1de his office with information on a Case. Th~y have told him that a subpoena is necessary to obtain records and ot~er.informati~n. Both Rossetti and King mentioned that when DCFS 1S 1nvolved w1th a case caseworkers often tell defense attorneys the details of a case; thereby ';blowing\" the state's case. DCFS hire 'professional gators with investigative experience to make initial determina\u00ad tions of indicated or unfounded abuse. They said that there is too much conflict fora worker to investigate a case impartially while also considering the welfare of the family and the Depart\u00ad mental philosophy of trying to keep the family intact whenever possible. King added, \"I live in fear of calling a DCFS worker for my witness. We just can't use them.\" -I Rossetti and King mentioned some specific cases to augment their argument concerning problems with DCFSi .the~ also ad~ed alle\u00ad gations about workers and supervisors perform1ng 1nappropr1a~e functions. The up'Shot of their comments was, that \"they perce1ved several crucial p~oblems with present activities and procedures of the DCFS workers in the immediate area, some of which seem to be tied to Department-wide philosophy and rules, and some of which cou ld be changed \" at the loca I, leve t!t; 1 ! _1 I , ~ I \" t I t :'1 1i\\ I' ~ I j :I ,1 a 1 Villa Park Police Detective Subject told us that he had no contact with DCFS. He said that he never calls DCFS or reports anyt~ing to them becau~e':{lin the ,past, DCFS has never responded to h1s reports. He sa1d that DCFS only had made things worse in cases that he had reported previously. DCFS caseworker Mary Ellen MCIntyre, who made the very first contact with Peter's family nearly eight months before Peter's death, told us about her employment with DCFS . ' She started in , the Lake County office, was transferred to the Villa Park (DuPage County) office in 1979, and only took over her duties as a neg- lect investigator in July of 1980. She described her transfer from the Lake ,County to the Villa Park office as \"culture shock.\" She said that the Lake County off ice is run much better than the Villa\"Park office, even though the Lake County office receives more calls that need to be investigated. She thought that the population in Lake County was more diverse than that of upper middle\u00ad class DuPage County, and therefore more careful to report possible cases. ,', , ' ,McIntyre felt that the relationship between DCFS and tl1~ courts was also superior in Lake County, partially because of the work done by the DCFS Court liaison, and partially because the Lake County State's Attorney's Office was much more a,ggressive in bring\u00ad ing cases of abuse and neglect to court. McIntyre mentioned the existence of a Lake County Community Residential Network, a type of multidisciplinary team that meets to discuss the very diffi\u00ad cult ,and severe cases. A DCFS supervisor sits on this particular committee. Lake County may also funqtion better, she said, be\u00ad cause all PCFS workers are assigned to specific teams, whereas in DuPage County each worker is given a caseload and is expected to handle it alone. In Lake County, the teams meet faithfully every week to staff difficult cases. In DuPage County, the workers are on thei;!:' own and they receive little, if any, support from supervisors. There is a lack of conSistency in DuPage County, she mentioned, adding that each supervisor wants things done his or her own way. Finally, McIntyre said that the police do not have anywhere near the kind of cooperation with DCFS workers in DuPage County that they have in La.ke County. MCIntyre speculated that because many residents of DuPage County are upper middle-class, they are not likely to report cases of abuse. She felt that many were com1?,le'j:ely unawar,e of the existence of DCFS. '::,; During the course of pursuing Peter's case, a Commission in\u00ad vestigator visited Loyola UnivE\\'lrsity Medical Center to speak with authorities there and to pick up records. We spoke at the time with Sister Rut!h Kleitsch, Dire'ctor of Social Services, and John S. Swartwout, llfssistant Hospital Director. We aSked Kleitsch why the case had nd,:t been reported to DCFS until five months after Peter's death. She admitted that 'the case should have been re\u00ad ported and regr,etted that it had not been.. She said that she had been on vacation when Peter was brought in and that her staff was not prepared to report the case. She added that because Peter was only in the hospital for a short period (24 hours), the So\u00ad cial Service Department did not have much time to get involved. -221-pa 44; 74 o She also stated that once a child is pronounced dead, the Gase is the responsibility of the Medical Examiner. (When we asked Medical Examiner Kirschner w~y he hadn't reported the case to DCFS, he said he assumed DCFS already~new about the case.) She guessed that in this case, because Peter had been transferred from Elmhurst to Loyola, staff on duty at Loyola must have assumed that the Elm\u00ad hurst authorities had reported the case. Both adminis.t~ators said that they had discussed the case extensively aftel:;:'\"/they discove:t;ed that it had not been reported correctly. LoyoLa has a child protection team that immediately tightened up its procedures so that a similar case could not fall through the cracks in their system, they said. Several days later, a Commission investigator went to the Memorial Hospital of DuPage County (Elmhurst r>lemorial Hospital) to pick up records on this case and to speak with Charles Warner, Director of Social Services at the hospital. We asked Warner the same question. He responded that he had not been Director of So\u00ad cial Services when Peter was brought in; he has been director only since October, 1980. He said that he did not know exactly \"Thy DCFS never was notified about the case, but guessed it was because the child was transferred to Loyola within 12 hours of admission and was still alive at the time. He added that because Peter was retarded both physically and mentally\" the abuse was not as ap\u00ad parent as it might have been with a 'inormal-sized\" child. His main point was that he assumed that Loyola would report to DCFS. He showed us the forms that had to be filled out on any case of suspected abuse or neglect and noted that they were quite lengthy and complicated. He suggested that the short time Peter was in the hospital, coupled with the mechanics of filling out these fo~ms, contributed to their lack of reporting. As at Loyola, aft~r the problem was discovered, the hospitalf staff doubled their etforts to discover and report suspected caseG of child abuse anq neglect. He said that reports have increased dramatically since Peter's case was discovered to have been mis\u00ad handled. Thus, in Peter's case, officials at both treating hospitals assumed incorrectly that the othE;r hospital had the responsibil.ity to report; neither bothered to check with the other hospital to . see if, indeed, a report had been made. And the Medical Examiner assumed incorrectly that the hospitals had already reported the case. G. Kurt Geisen On May 22, 1979, the Crystal Lake Police Department received a report that smoke was coming from an apartment puilding. Offi\u00ad cers responded and found a young boy chained to a bed in the burn\u00ad ing apartment. The boy, Kurt Geisen, was taken to a local hospi~ tal to be treated for severe burns and smoke inhalation. He died the next day. -222-i 1 I fl I' f ~ 1 I r f I: t !/ t Vi i ~ .'! It(' iJ~ I I I I ! .l i f .. , r,' .~. 1 '~ ': i j Local newspapers ran the story and, because the Department of Children and Family Services had been involved with the case, accused DCFS of negligence. Governor James Thompson's concern over this case led him to order an independent investigation. In addition, the: Commission looked at the events, which led to Kurt Geisen's death. Kurt was born July 11, 1965 and developed a medical condition known as Prader-Willi Syndrome. The two major characteristics of this syndrome are developmental delay (both physical and men\u00ad tal) and a compulsion to overeat to such a degree that the af\u00ad flicted person's life is endangered. This need to continually eat caused Kurt's mother to restrain him to his bed with a chain when she was at work and Kurt was unsupervised in the home. On April 30, 1971, DCFS received a child abuse report from a doctor who had examined five-year-old Kurt and noticed slight bruises on the boy's shoulder and head. Kurt's mother told the doctor that her husband had abused the child. \"DCFS workers were unable to contact anyone in the family until May 13, at which time the boy's mother explained that Kurt's father had hit him after becoming angry at her. She stated that her husband was alcoholic and assured the workers that such an incident would no\u00b7t recur be\u00ad cause she had filed for divorce. DCFS records contain case notes and summaries of this incident, but no further action was taken because of the mother's interest in obtaining a divorce and be\u00ad cause the father was no longer in the home. The next contact with DCFS occurred on March 11, 1977, when Richard Taber, a social worker for the Special Education District of McHenry County (SEDOM), which provided schooling and other ser\u00ad vices for Kurt, called to report that Kurt had been absent from school for two days and had,returned with bruises. Taber requested that DCFS not take any action at the time because he planned to speak to the mother about the incident. Taber just wanted to make the report. Apparently DCFS did no follow-up on this incident. On April 20, 1979, the Crystal Lake Police Department received a call from a neighbor of the Geisen's who said that Kurt was roam\u00ad ing through the apartment complex in which he lived, knocking on doors. \" The police contacted Kurt's mother, Delores DeGeorge, who told them that because of Kurt's extreme mental retardation and his compulsion to eat, she had been forced to chain him to his bed and that he somehow got out. Mrs. DeGeorg.e said that she had a difficult time finding qualified babysitters because of the na\u00ad ture of Kurt's disease. On April 24, 1979, Detective Keith Nygren of the Crystal Lake police Department called the Lake County Youth Service Bureau and reported that Kurt's mother admitted to cha\u00b7ining Kurt to his bed during unsupervised periods. The Youth Service Bureau, which was handling after-hours DCF~ calls at that time, contacted DCFS the next morning with the report. -223-... 44 .42 DCFS worker Ann Indelicato visited the home on April 26. Kurt and his mother were present at the meeting. The mother re\u00ad peated to the worker essentially what she had told the pollce. ,. She admitted to keeping Kurt chained up at times even when she was home, and said that she or her daughter maintained supervi\u00ad sion of Kurt when he was loose. Regarding the incident reported to the police on April 20, Mrs. DeGeorge stated that Kurt apparently found the key to his chain which was kept outside of his room, unlocked himself, and left the apartment. The locking mechanism consisted of a chaih attached to a collar that fit around Kurt's ankle. The chain was approximately twenty feet long and gave Kurt access to his room, the hallway outside of the room and the bathroom. The collar was just tight enough to keep Kurt from getting loose. During this visit, Kurt showed his bedroom to the caseworker and showed her how he chained himself. The worker made the following notation in the case record: \"When questioned about what would happen in case of fire, Mrs. DeGeorge stated that she and her daughter each had a key close by to use.\" The caseworker asked Kurt's mother why she did not just lock the refrigerator and kitchen cabinets and was told that this method had peen tried but \"penalized the family.\" Also discussed was the possibility of residential placement for Kurt, but this was preliminary only. On April 27, the caseworker contacted Patricia Fohrman, a SEDOM nurse, in order to develop a better understanding of Prader\u00ad Willi Syndrome. Fohrman told her that those who suffer from the . syndrome never have the feeling of being full, and can quite liter\u00ad ally eat themselves to death. Most of those who have the disease do not live very long and die from complications associated with:'i obesity. The nurse said that the usual way to deal with the protr. lem is to lock the cabinets and refrigerator. Richard Taber of SEDOM also talked to Indelicato on this date. He said that he had been unaware of Kurt's being chained and told the workers that he would help the mother install locks in her kitchen. . DCFS discussed this case at a regular weekly team meeting held April 30. The discussion concerned Kllrt's condition and how his mother was handling it. The decision was made to assist SEDOM staff in changing the mother's attitude about the necessity of chaining Kurt, and to work with SEDOM in finding an appropriate residential placement for the boy. SEDOM records show that Mrs. DeGeorge met with staff members on May 4, 1979, to discuss Kurt's behavior problems both at home and at school. The mother stated that Kurt was chained and un\u00ad supervised generally between 4:45 p.m., when she left for work, and 10:15 or 10:30 p.m., when he:!; daught,er returned home from a part-time job. - SEDOM staff expressed their concern with the chaining and asked that the mother continue to seek an appropriate babysitter for this period. Staff members indicated that they would talk -224-to DCFS about a homemaker for that period of the day when Kurt was home alone. The mother requested that SEDOM look into resi\u00ad dential placement for her son in light of her inc~easing diffi\u00ad culty controlling him. Everyone agreed to conunun~cate better so that disciplinary measures for Kurt~ both at home and at school, would be more consistent. Taber sent a copy of the memo explaining this meeti~g.t~ Indelicato at DCFS, with a brief note regarding the posslblilty of DCFS providing homemaker services. On May 15, he sent a let\u00ad ter to Kurt's mother to be certain that she had understood what SEDOM staff had decided to do regarding Kurt. In reference to the mother's request that he look into residential care, Taber mentions in the letter that any such care is \"very costly.\" He continues, \"r know of two ways that State agencies might eventu\u00ad ally agree to help with this high cost, as follows.\" He then adds the following two paragraphs: 1. 2. For children and teenagers, one way is through the courts andD.C.F.S. with the child made a ward of the state. often parents ask for help saying they cannot give the child what the child needs. DoC.FoS. has a policy of trying to keep children in the home and D.C.F.S. may offer various kinds of help to try to keep the child in the home. But, if these attempts fail thp.n DoC.F.S. may take action to provide the best available residential placement for the child, such as foster care, children's home, or other residential care. Under the State Department of Mental Health & Develop\u00ad mental Disabilities (DMH-DD), sometimes funds can be made available for those with developmental disabil'ities. (Kurt is developmentally disabled.) At this time we could not attest that his present educational placement (SEDOM) is inappropriate for him. So we could not ask your local school district to help pay the educational portion of any present residential placement. This would mean that the State DMH-DD would have to agree to fund the cost of any residential placement. The state DMH-DD is very reluctant to fund residential placements. The gist of the'information is that residential placement did not seem to be a likely alternative for Kurt. A telephone conversation Retween Taber and Indelicato on May 15, ledotothe following agreements: 1) 2) The homemaker request was inappropriate for this situa\u00ad tion. M~. Taper agreed to proceed with assisting Mso DeGeorge in appiying for residential placement for ~urt. Mr. Taber agreed to visit a few local residential treat\u00ad ment centers with MS. DeGeorge. -225-pa 44 ., .. I r\" 4) This worker [Indelicato] agreed to search files for a licensed night-care home for Kurt. 5) This worker agreed to contact Public Aid to determine if they could help the mother in payment for residential care. The plan developed was simple: cooperate with SEDaM in finding residential care; attempt to locate licensed night-care; and re\u00ad visit Mrs. DeGeorge to further discuss the issue of restraining her son. On May 30, 1979, after Kurt had died, SEDaM produced an\u00abin\u00ad ternal document stating the chronological events that led up to Kurt's death. Listed in this account are tge various meetings that had been held. The point is strongly made that both the po\u00ad lice and DCFS were aware of Kurt's chaining for seven days prior to SEDaM's being contacted. A good deal of the memo concerns it\u00ad self with efforts by SEDaM staff to try to persuade the mother not to chain Kurt. Most of what we have discussed is reiterated in this internal document. The document states that no one in\u00ad formed anyone at SEDaM of Kurt's death, thou,gh a neighbor of the family notified SEDaM's transportation department of the fire and of the fact that Kurt had been badly burned. The document concludes with a statement that SEDaM had done all that it could to provide appropriate supportive help in this case and shared no culpability for Kurt's death. Commission investigators interviewed most of the key people involved in the Geisen case. Included in these interviews were conversations with three representatives of the Crystal Lake lolice Department: Lieutenant James Weidner, Commander of Investigations; Detective Keith Nygren, Juvenile Officer; and Officer Kathy Sgeley, also a Juvenile Officer. They commented first on their investiga\u00ad tions of child abuse and neglect in general and then addresseOi the issues of the Geisen case. The three said that DCFS officials, at a traini.ng seminar.., had told the police in the area that they did not want police ,'in\u00ad volved in any cases of abuse or neglect. Officer Sheley added that she had heard th~. same thing personally. They said that the only time DCFS contacted the police was when DCFS needed to be \"bailed outll of a situation. The officers agreed that DCFS defi\u00ad nitely tries to hold to its policy of preservation of the family within the home at all costs. ~ The officers had a number of ,.complaints regarding DCFS' op~ra\u00ad tion: they do not understand how DCFS can conduct ch.ild abuse andcneglect investigations over the phone; they have had problems with getting DCFS to respond when the police take protective cus\u00ad tody of a child; and they had a~ occasion when they picked up a runaway who was also a DCFS ward and the agency workers refused to come and get the child. -226-..- e\u00b7 .~:? ! U I I I ~ ~ .... (' t ;.~ ~ j :l .~ ./ 1 I ~ ~ ~ ~ i , 1 1 (. f Also, the officers were not aware of any correspondence from DCFS regarding either the new reporting laws or the toll-free \"hot\u00ad line\" number for reporting. A Commission investigator spoke with Winnebago County Chief ~epu\u00b7ty C<:>roner Ruth Anderson. Her office was responsible for the 1nquest into Kurt's death because Kurt died in a hospital in Rock\u00ad ford, which is in Winnebago County. Anderson said that in the five years that she ~ad been with the coroner's office, there had been only two deaths resulting from possible child abuse or neg\u00ad lect. She described cooperation with local law enforcement bodies as excellent., She described portions of the autopsy procedure. ~d,she descr1bed one of the major functions of her office: deter\u00ad m1n1ng the facts surrounding any death and presenting information to th~ coroner's jury. ,She said that it was this jury that would class1fy a death as acc1dental, suicide, homicide, or other. ~he told u~ that the jury is composed of six people; this jury 1S respons1ble for determining the cause of death but can also make recomme~dations. In the\"Geisen c~se; the coroner's jury found that Kurt d1ed from severe burns and smoke inhalation. The death was ruled accidental but \"parties\" to the death were cited as negligent. Anderson told us that the parties referred to were Kurt's mother and sister. The State Fire Marshal's report indi\u00ad cated that no accelerant had been used in the fire and that the probable cause of fire was either matches or a defective toy. , ~he McHenry County Grand Jury returned to the McHenry County C1rcU1t Court a report of their deliberations into the Geisen case on June 8, 1979. The report contains a \"No True Bill\" and states that \"there is no probable cause for an indictment to be issued regarding possible criminal violations.\" The following fiv~ para\u00ad graphs are taken verbatim from the text of the Grand Jury's re\u00adport: We want to reprimand the Department of Children and Family Ser\u00ad vices for their lack of follow-through and their negligence in this case. We .feel, in this case, that the child should .' never have been chained to his bed and left alone. Further, that once the authorities knew of this boy's chaining, the boy should h~ve been placed in protective custody until the matter was resolved as to how this boy was going to live the rest of his ,life. We want to reprimand the Department of Children and Family Ser\u00ad vices for their. inaction\"and for the decisions they made in handling 'this boy's life. .we also want to reprimand the. Department of Children and Family Services for th~ir lack of as~istance to the mother. They should have gon~ back into the home to check and see if the boy was being neglected or left alone. We dQn't want another \"Kurt incident.\" -227-a Qgg titS We do not condone the methods used by Mrs. DeGeorge in chain\u00ad ing Kurt and leaving him unattended when she had said she would not do so. We want to reprimand Mrs. DeGeorge for her negligence in leaving her son alone. A Commission investigator discussed the Geisen case with Ann Indelicato. Included was discussion of the reprimands from the . Grand Jury and a complete discussion of the activities that oc\u00ad curred prior to the fatal fire. At the time of our interview, Indelicato was the DCFS intake coordinator for DCFS-McHenry County. She had served with DCFS for five years at the time of the interview. Before that she had been a school teacher and worker for Public Aid. Indelicato told us that her primary function was investigation of alleged child abuse and neglect cases in McHenry County. She said that she had a number of \"desk cases\" that required more monitoring. She added ~hat norma~ly intakecworkers conduct the initial investigations; 1f a case 1S opened, the case is transferred to another worker Indelicato said that the Lake Villa Office, to which she was at\u00ad tached, did not have a CPS unit as such. As an intake worker, she functioned much as a CPS worker in Cook County might. At the time of our interview, Indelicato said that the Lake County Youth Services Bureau had provided after-hours answering services for DCFS until January 1, 1980. Their contract expired and t4.e after-hours calls service had been picked up by the Antioch Answering Service. Indelicato said that their operators have re\u00ad ceived training ih handling calls and that they determine when they receiv: a call if it is serious enough to be referred immediately to an 1nta,ke worker on-call, or if it should wait until the, next business day. She also mentioned that the Youth Services Bureau had used the same procedure when handling their calls before 1980. Calls are now handled by the nhotline\" in Springfield. Indelicato also discussed the details of the Geisen case. She a~mitted that DCFS was the primary agency respr;nsiblefor handl1ng Kurt's welfare, but she felt that askingSEDOM for as\u00ad sistance in this case was adequate. SEDaM had been involved with Kurt. f'qr some time. Furthermore, she charged that SEDaM staff had khown about Kurt I s chaining for a,t least a year before DCFS was called in to deal with the problem. Indelicato consulted her case notes, which indicated that she was to attempt to locate night-care for Kurt and to contact the ~epartment of Public Aid concerning funding for possible resi\u00ad d~nt1a~ placement. She told us that she did make an attempt to fl.nd n1ght-care for Kurt .but was unsuccessful and that she did not contact the Department of Public Aid because she had previously'ii tried to get assistanqe from the Department on another case and was unsuccessful. She told us that she felt that trying in Kurt's c'ase would do no good. II '~ We had a chance to exmaine Indelicato IS cas.e notes and diS- covered that her attempts to find night-care and her rationale -228-, () for not contacting the Department of Public Aid are not reflected therein. Indelicato addressed problems with the Department of Mental Health/Developmental Disabilities. She told ,PS that it is very difficu,lt for a parent with a developmentally disabled child (like Kurt) to ~eceive assistance from the Department; she said that a parent can apply personally for an individual care grant but will be placed on aO long waiting list. Indelicato claimed that DMH/DD does not in fact have emergency placements available in spite of DMH's statements to the contrary. Indelicato was very critical of DMH/DD's operations. She said that it is difficult to get ahold of anyone person involved with emergency placements at DMH/DD and that is very hard to have a child placed as an emer\u00ad gency because of the red tape involved. Indelicato told us that although she had not seen either of two reports that DCFS had issued about the Geisen incident, she had heard that the Department supported the way the case was handled. Regarding the Grand Jury reprimands, Indelicato said that the chain\u00ad ing that Kurt went through was not abusive but had been done for protective purposes only. She mentioned that the mother had told her that the chaining occurred for short periods of time only. Based on the information she had at the time, she did not think that the case warranted protective custody. She added that if . the case were so serious that the child should have been removed from the home, the police should have been the ones to do so, par\u00ad ticularly since they had known about the chaining for four days before they reported it. She said that she did not think that she had failed to follow u? with the mother because DCFS was Jl}~p\u00ad dated to utilize existing agencies and services and because SED~M' had stated its interest in helping the mother. apply for residen\":i; tial placement for Kurt. She said that she does not call the,.pd\u00ad lice every time she investigates a case of abuse or,neglect, but she does call, them when necessary and claims t,o enjoy an excel\u00ad lent relationship with them. Indelicato's final comments were more general. She added to her criticisms of the court system in mentioning that during the pa~t five years in McHenry County there had been only one in\u00ad stance in which parental rights were terminated by the courts. She described that situation as a very clear message that it is difficult if 'not impossible to attempt sucll a termination in that county. DCFS is left with two Cl,lternatives, she\" said: return the child to the home or attempt to use court-ordered services. She said that one doe~ not get much cooperation from parents who are ordered by the court to have a homemaker or to attend coun\u00ad seling. She added that in her opinion, juvenile matters in general ar~ at the botta~ of the list of priorities in the courts. Later, we intervi.ewed Diane Breske, Indelicato's supervisOr in the Lake Villa Office. Breske .addresseo. the G~isen case di-' rectly as well as some of the more general issues we have alluded to freq~ently in this report. -229-\" a Q g .* \" \"\" \" ~., Breske stated that workers in the Lake Villa Office are not all~wed to accept the voluntary placement of children. She reasoned th~/t. if placement-type services were really eleededl' the courts shC)uld be involved. Breske complained that the courts d? no~ take abuse and neglect cases as seriously as criminal cases, as eV1denced by the assignment of the newest and least-trained judg:s and a~sis\u00ad tant state's attorneys to juvenile matters. Breske sa1d that 1t takes time for a judge to learn the nuances of handling juvenile cases. She said that everyone had been fortunate in Lake County because the same judges had been handling juve~ile matters for a few years. But she added that, in her exper1ence, the only ~eople who remain in juvenile court are those who are personally comm1tted to children. We asked Breske about the relationship between DCFS and law enforcement agencies. She admitted that complaints from police about lack of contact when DCFS makes an investigation are true. She said that DCFS workers will contac't the police when investi\u00ad gating a \"major\" case but will n.o~ do s,? otherwise because many of the small police departments w1th wh1ch workers mu~t deal are IIlittle gossip mills. II Most of the departments to wh1ch she re\u00ad ferred are small and are located in small commun,ities where lIevery\u00ad one knows everyone else.1I Breske felt that th~ police,do re\u00ad spect the privacy and confidentiality of s,?me 1nformat10~. She added that police tend to get IIcaught Upll 1n \"cases\"part1cul~rly incest ca~es, and consequently approach a d1f\u00ad ferent perspective ~han does DCFS. . Overall though Breske DCFS enjoys a good relation\u00ad ship with yo~th offi~ers from various police department.s. She did single Qut the Crystal Lake Police Department as one depart\u00ad ment with which her workers had had problems in the past. Breske suggested th~it the younger you'th off icers are eas ier f,?r h~r ~ork\u00ad ers to get a/Long with than off icers who have been work1ng 1n the. Juvenile Division for a number of years. ~ Breske admitted that her workers did have t~e power to take protective custody of a child, but she added that the Lak~ Villa, Off ice had instituted a policy of not doin9' so .if the po11ce were not present. The only exception might be her workers taking,pro\u00ad tective custody of a child while he is in school. Breske sa1d that there were two reasons for this policy: first, police offi\u00ad cers are better equipped and trained to handle protective cus\u00ad tody duties than are caseworkers 1 and second, she felt that some police departments felt that the new law was erodil;g police, powers. As a result, she wanted to be certain that the poll-ce were 1nvolved in these matters whenever possible. Breske predicted that the new reportin~ law would result in an increased number ofr) investigations. She said that the degree to which caseloads increase will depend on the ability of central registry staff to screen out the calls that do not require response or immediate response.,Breske added that one benefit of the new law would be the allowance ~or DCFS workers to take 60 days to complete an investigation (as opposed to the 30 days mandated by ~-; -230-, 'f the old law). She allowed that it should not take 60 days to com\u00ad plete an investigation, but often 30 days is not sufficient~ebause the caseworkers must depend on a number of other people to provide information and records, and these other people might not respond as quickly as they should., The second benefit Breske saw to the new reporting law was the advantage that the Department would have to close a case if it had been presented to the court and had been denied for court services and if the family had refused to cooperate with DCFS. She said that this would enable DCFS to close out cases that otherwise would clog the system. At the time of ' our interview with Breske, she said that DCFS was not providing training in investigative techniques. She said that intake workers in her office, who would all be called CPS workers after July 1, 1980, no longer fool themselves into think\u00ad ing they are anything other than investigators, because that is what the intake position has evolved into. Breske said that she has provided in-service training and that many of her.worke.rs have picked up techniques of investigation from police officers but that the area of investigation and training to conduct investiga\u00ad tions remained a serious deficiency in the Department. Breske talked about the Geisen incident. She repeated that Indelicato had determined that protective custody was not in. or\u00ad der in Kurt's case because, although Kurt was mentally retarded, he still could understand and communicate. Further, to remove him from the home could have been very traumatic for him, Breske said, because he did enjoy a good relationship with his sister and,1 mother, who were trying their best to provide care for him. The chaining was not abusive but was for Kurt's own welf~~e. Breske told us that it was her impression that the mother was very coopera\u00ad tive and had agreed not to chain Kurt during the unsupervised period in the overlap between her job and her daughter's. Finally, SEDaM had agreed to help the mother find an appropriate residential place\u00ad ment for Kurt if still deemed necessary. Breske told us that she had not seen documentation, but had been \u00b7\u00a3:bld that SEDOM staff had bee~. a~qare that Kurt was being chained for more than a year prior to DCFS involvement in the case. \" I) Breske admitted to our invest.igat,or that, normally, the DCFS intake worker would have conducted. another home visit to see if the mother were in fact obtaining proper supervision for Kurt. Breske said that in this cc:\\se, the intake worker had important personal business that kept her out of the office for awhile and that she did not conSider th~;o_case to be a particularly IIhotll one, so she left the case with another, intake worker for follow-up dur\u00ading her absence. Breske echoed what Indelicato had told us concerning DMH/DD's 0lack of emergency plac~mentsr Breske said that if a case~orker calls DMH/DD, staff there will give the worker the names of spe\u00ad cific residential placements to call and the worke.r would have to place the calls himself. It was her impression that parents have had better luck dealing d;i.rectly with DMH/DD than her workers had had. 6 -231-a Qap aIQ We asked Breske about use of an individual care grant for Kurt's res{dential placement. She responded that she was unsure, whether DMH/DD had the money for such a grant at the time. She said that the DMH/DD staff did not keep it a secret that the De\u00ad partment had run out of money for placement of children with psy\u00ad chiatric problems but was unsure of the funding status for chil\u00ad dren who were developmentally disabled. We discovered that both Breske and Indelicato received writ\u00ad ten reprimands from DCFS Director Coler for their handling o.f the GE;:isen case. Breske was extremely angry at getting a reprimand b~cause she felt at the time and still feels now that the case had been handled properly. She told us that she had learned that the letter had not been written by Coler and was replete with in\u00ad accu;racies. She challenged the statements in the letter of repri\u00ad mand through the Departmental grievance procedure, and the matter finally was settled by the letter being removed from her permanent personnel file. Breske told us that Indelicato was challenging her own letter of reprimand and that the matter had not been re\u00ad solved. Breske told us that she understood why Coler had to issue a reprimand. She described him as a political person bound to certain political realities who really had no choice in the mat- ter. She added that if she were in his position, she would have done the same thing. Breske was upset that information in the letters had been obtained by the press and publicized, making it difficult for her to continue in her job, knowing that others were aware of the specifics of the letter. These comments led to Breske's evaluation that the Department does not support its employees. ' Breske felt that she would have been suspended from her job if her supervisor and the supervisor above him had not supported he:}!' position. She claimed that everyone present at the Grand Jury, !I hearing except for Indelicato and herself was represented by an \" attorney. This statement concluded Breske's information and opin\u00ad ion regarding Departmental involvement in the Geisen case. A Cormnission investigator spoke with several representatives of the Special Education Di9,trict of McHenry Count~ (SEDOM). Again, we elicited general responses to the problem of chl.ld abuse and neglect and then addressed the Geisen case specifically. Dr. James Albert, Superintendent for SEDOM, provided many of the answers to our questions.,. Joining him in the interview were the following staff: Richard VV,oosnam, psychologist~ Timothy Foran, social worker. All of the SEDOM staff agreed that DCFS employs a \"bandaid\" approach to child abuse and neglect cases. They said that DOFS utilizes stock responses to almost all cases: homemakers and ad\u00ad vocates. They added that DCFS rarely addresses the problems that lead to the genesis of abuse ,and neglect in the horne. Instead, they concentrate on the imrnedate needs of a parent or child. SEDOM staff observed that many of the parents who neglect or abuse their -?32-t r i children simply do not know how to parent properly and probably could benefit from proper training and counseling. The SEDOM staff complained that many caseworkers are impro\u00ad perly trained or prepared to handle cases of child abuse and neg\u00ad lect. SEDOM staff indicated that none of them would want to work for DCFS, where the pay is poor and morale is exceedingly low. As we have noted elsewhere, turnover was extremely high among DCFS caseworkers, according to SEDOM staff. SEDOM staff also referred \"to the DCFS philosophy of preservation of the home at all costs. Holding ~ child's welfare in a position of secondary importance can cause problems with workers trained to be concerned about chil\u00ad dren and their problems. SEDOM staff criticized DCFS caseworkers for conducting shal- 10w0investigations into abuse/neglect allegations and for taking events and stories of occurrences at face value. They c:ited several cases in which the investigative effort was just too simplistic and in which the child suffered as a result. SEDOM staff told us that caseworkers are not trained to gather evidence or to ade\u00ad quately evaluate the truth of charges. The information that they develop often cannot be introduced into a court of law. We also discussed the Geisen case in particular. Much of the chronology reflected in SEDOM documents that we have presented here was repeated to us. Dr. Albert also responded to several questions about SEDOM's handling of the case. He said that no member of the SEDOM staff had been aware of Kurt's chaining until 'they received a call from Ann Indelicato, and the purpose of that call was not to tell SEDOM about the chaining but to inquire about the nature of Prader-Willi Syndrome. As a result of the conver\u00ad sation, however, the chaining incidents came to light. . According to Al,bert, full' responsibility for the resolution of the chaining incidents lay \"1ith DCFS. Albert felt that even if the boy had not been chained during unsupervised periods, he still was being neglected because of the seriousness of his con\u00ad dition. In effect, he was saying that there should have been no unsupervised periods. Albert said that SEDOM staff spoke both with the mother and with DCFS staff in order to try to find an answer to the problem but could go no further. Albert said that, under the law, if the school district could not accomodate Kurt, it had the responsibiltiy to place Kurt in a private residential facility and pay the cost. But, he added, Kurt's condition was such that the programs offered by SEDOM were appropriate; thus, Kurt could not be referred nor could the school district pay for residential placement. Dr. Albert mentioned the DCFS investigation of the incident that was handled by James Gottreich. Albert said that the investi\u00ad gation was notj~ the result of DCE'S interest in Kurt's death but rather had be;;fi the. result of Albert's interest in making clear that SEDOM, was not in anyway culpable for Kurt's death. He told us that someone from the Lake Villa DCFS office and another DCFS official had made statements to the press implying wrongdoing or -233-a &Q; g ,#& - lack of action by SEDOM. As a result, Albert tried to reach DCFS Director Coler but none of his calls was returned. Finally,' Albert told whoever answered the phone in Director Coler's office that if he didn't hear from Coler, he was going to issue a state\u00ad ment to the press. Albert said that Coler returned his call fif\u00ad tee~ minutes lat~r and the next morning Gottreich appeared at SEDOM off~ces. Gottre~ch spent the day with SEDOM staff who asked him for more information on the disposition of cases i~volving chil\u00ad dren whom SEDOM was servicing. Gottreich agreed to provide the information, Albert said, but never did. None of the SEDOM staf.f went into any more detail regarding the investigation into Kurt Geisen's death. The final document that the Commission obtained is a draft ::eport from the Illinois Developmental Disabilities Advocacy Au.thor\u00ad ~ty (IDDM) on the events leading up to Kurt Gei sen's death. The re\u00ad port was prepared at the request of Governor Thompson and was to be presented directly to him. We spoke briefly in 1980 with then\u00ad Executive Director Stephen Schnorf of IDDM, who emphasized to us that the report was only a draft and that no findings or recom\u00ad mendations had yet been prepared. He did indicate to us that one of the findings was to be that SEDOM had been in error because SEDOM staff did know about Kurt's chaining long before DCFS in\u00ad volvemen\u00b7t. The report mentions that it had been prepared as the result of Governor Thompson's interest in having an appropriate agency conduct an \"independent investigationll into the circumstances sur\u00ad rounding Kurt Geisen's death. The review team that IDDM assembJed consisted of the following IDDM staff, plus Susan Sitter, a LegJI Advocacy Service attorney: Stephen B. Schnorf; Gary R. South, of report's introduction mentions that approximately one week after Kurt's death, twq, members of the. review team interviewed Mrs. DeGeorge. She was cooperative and willing to discuss the circumstances of her son's being chained. In effect, she explai'ned the conditions of the syndrome with which Kurt had been afflicted. Mrs. DeGeorge told the review team members that Kurt was chained at night while other family members were asleep and at all times when there was no one home to watch him. She added that the chaining had been going on for a long time and that, before he was chained by his ankle to his bed, he had been restrained by his bedroom door be\u00ad ing chained partially shut so that he couldn't get out. She said .that SEDOM, DCFS, and the Crystal Lake Police became aware of the chaining on April 24, 1979; she was unaware if the agen~ies knew anything about the chaining before that date. ' ~ The mother gescribed DCFS involvement as unentnusiastic. She mentioned that a DCFS caseworker had visited the home after DCFS learned of the chaining, but she had made no attempt to re\u00ad contact Mrs. DeGeorge, nor did Mrs. DeGeorge feel that DCFS was going to take any action at all in relation to her or her son's problem. -234-I ~ I i . \u00b7~J ~; -I c:' . I, l t j '. ! \" The review team then examined documents from both DCFS and SEDOM. AI~ r~levant entries are summarized in a chronology of events beg~nn~ng October 6, 1972. The review team was careful to differentiate between DCFS and SEDOM records when presenting the chronology of events. Included is a notation from 1972 that Kurt had been getting up at night to steal food from the kitchen and that the mother was trying to find a way to fasten a padlock to the refrigerator door. Notations from both DCFS and SEDOM from March, 1977, reflect contact between a SEDOM nurse and DCFS work\u00ad ers regarding Kurt's (::oming to school with bruises and scratches including the nurse's request that DCFS not become active at that time. There were several references to Kurt being bruised upon arrival at school, and no reports were made to DCFS. This hap\u00ad pened at least four times in 1977 alone. The notations continue into 1978. The most significant notations, which indicate that SEDOM staf~ knew that Kurt was being chaiued at night, come from a SEDOM staff conference dated October 30, 1978. This conference was at\u00ad tended by seven SEDOM workers and Mrs. DeGeorge. No report was made to DCFS and the record indicates the following: IIHow handle overeating? Chains to bed at night 11 The next reports date from April, 1979, when both DCFS and SEDOM became. involved in the chaining problem after the Crystal Lake Police Department was called, as we have mentioned. It seems fairly clear that both DCFS and SEDOM did not act as quickly or as appropriately as they should have. Documenta- tion seems to make it clear that SEDOM staff failed to report Kurt's bruises on at least six occasions. SEDOM staff also apparently had been aware prior to Crystal Lake Police Department involvement that Kurt was being chained in his home, and no report was made to DCFS. DCFS, for its part, was not very aggressive in handling the case. At the very least, \"more caseworker contact could have occurred, or counseling could have been arranged for Mrs. DeGeorge so that she could learn alternative methods of handling her son. Residential placement did appear to be an impossibility because SEDOM was fulfilling Kurt's needs and because the mother was per\u00ad fectly willing to care for him in the home. DCFS lacked resources to provide the support that Mrs. DeGeorge should have had during any unsupervised periods. There are two.possible conclusions to our analysis of this case. The first is that this was a very nO,n-routine type of case, a case that DCFS is not likely to encounter very often. Perhaps . DCFS should develop an internal method to deal with cases like this. Staffing these cases--either at a regional or state level~\u00ad might provide solutions to extremely rare and hard-to-solve cases such as this one. The second conclusion, which follo\\<IS from the first, is that it might be unnecessarily bureaucratic or cumbersome to develop a system to handle non-routine cases, either regionally or state\u00ad wide, because there are so few such cases. An internal policy or substructure within DCFS to handle such a small number of cases -235-A 241 \u00a5QJ&E 2Q m'l' ght b'e a waste.

No further allegations of abuse were received, so DCFS closed the case on September 17, 1975. DCFS' next contact with the family came in January of 1976. On January 30, the Galesburg DCFS office received a call from a neighbor alleging that the Madden children we~e being abused. The neighbor said their father, Gerald .Madden, had been sent to prison two ~'eeks ' earlier and that Tina and Alan, aged two years and several months, respectively, had not been seen for five weeks and were probably being neglected. DCFS accepted the case for service to begin February 20, and aSSigned it to caseworker Vernon Weiss. Coincidentally, it seems, on that date DCFS received a call from the Knox County Sheriff's Department requesting that a worker come to the ja,il to discuss child care arrangements for Pamela Madden*s children. Pamela had been arrested and charged with several criminal offenses, includ\u00ad ing forgery. Tina and Alan were placed in temporary foster care that same day. DCFS records concerning the events which took place during this period are unclear. Court records, however, show that the children's father had been incarcerated at Vandalia State Peni\u00ad tentiary since approximately September 1975, and that Pamela Madden had shown an interest in having her ch~ldren put up for adoption, not merely placed in foster care, during her jail sentence. She allegedly told caseworker Judith Ludwig that she felt her children had been through enough, and that she no longer wanted the responsi\u00adbility of raising them; she felt that she had taken on too much too early in her life. There is, however, no written documenta\u00adtion regarding Ludwig's conversation with Madden. Adoptive surrenders were taken in front of Judge William Richardson on February 23, 1976. The document Mrs.cMadden Signed is entitled \"Final and Irrevocable Surrender to an Agency for Pur\u00ad poses of Adoption of a Born Child.\". Underscored within the docu\u00ad ment is the following clause: \"That I understand I cannot under o any circumstances, after signing this surrender, change my mind or revoke or cancel this surrender, or obtain or recover custody or any other rights over such child. II Separate surrenders are filed for each of the two children, and both are accompanied by signed documents from Judge Richardson. Caseworker notes indicate that DCFS planned to secure adop\u00adtive rights to the children and place t~em in permanent homes. An alternative plan prov;i.dedfor fosterl1placement if the father would not surrender parental rights, to last until one of the par\u00ad ents was able to provide for the children. It is made clean), how\u00ad ever, that adoption was the preferable course of action. The next document in the Madden case file is dated June 2, 1976 and is addressed to William King, ASSistant Guardianship Administrator in Peoria, \"from Judith Ludwig. It informs King that the Madden children had been returned to their father OtiMay 28 -237-and were residing with him in the Galesburg home of his sister and her family. The memo mentions that the mother had surrendered her rights \"and thus 'has termina\u00b7ted .her rights to the children,\" and also reveals that the Maddens had initiated divorce proceeq\u00ad ings. Although Ludwig apparently thought the children were being adequately cared for, the question remained as to how and when custody could be officially transferred back to Mr. Madden. It appears that a good deal of DCFS internal communication is missing from the case file, as conversations and actions are referred to for which there is no documentation in the file. This paucity provides at best a cloudy picture of the events leading up to Alan's death. Case notes do indicate, however, that Gerald Madden obtained custody of his children through a final divorce action against his wife on May 28, 1976, and that at this time he was attempting to find employment, although caseworkers felt his plans were un\u00ad realistic. Case notes do not reflect the supervision which DCFS supposedly maintained over the children throughout 1976. This is not to say that supervision was not main~ainedi there are sim\u00ad ply no records documenting any such service during that time. The next DCFS contact reflected in the case notes occurred during February and March of 1977, at which time Ludwig and her supervisor Jerry D. Scobee visited the Madden home.. At issue was concern over the care of both of the Madden children, particularly in the areas of medical neglect, nutritional neglect, social isola\u00ad tion, bruises on the children, lack of financial support, and ex\u00ad posure of the children to homosexual activities. During the visit, however, Madden denied that his children were being harmed in any of these ways, and that he w.as doing the best he could. ',' The workers apparently broached the subjects of possible DCFS-provided day-care and adoption, but Madden appeared reluctant and asked for time to think over the services offered. Ludwig contacted Madden severa.l times in the next few weeks, but was not able to get, him to agree to any departmental suggestions. In the case notes, Ludwig writes that the case would be closed until DCFS heard from Madden regard\u00ad ing the offered services or thrQugh another referral. postscripted at the bottom of the form is a notation that both children appeared to be pale and both were in diapers. Nothing more was done to substantiate or investigate the'above allegations, nor did the notation concerning the children's condition affect Ludwig's in\u00ad formal closing of the case. . Early in 19'77 DCFS received reports that Madden was neglect\u00ad ing his children. His sister called to report that l-1a):1den' and the children had moved from her home and added that he hi;ld been neglectful. Other altlegations.,were logged in through 1977, up until,.August 12, which ~said Madden had neglected the children, was disciplining them inappropriately, and that he did not pro\u00ad vide t,hem with enough food. He denied all the ~llegations. c On August 12, 1977, Madd~n visited the Department's Galesburg office to tell workers he was7completing a locksmithing corres\u00ad pondence cOllrse and to ask if they could provide him with any\" in- -238-r \" i formation concerning small bUSiness loans. A worker named Joan Kelly spoke with Madden on this date as Ludwig was out of the of\u00ad fice. ,She told him she would look for such information and also told h~ DCFS would be able to provide day care for the children. Madden was apparently not receptive to her suggestions. The worker expressed concern over the medical condition of the children and she as~ed Madden to provide her with a breakdown of his monthly ~xpenses, wh~ch w~re,as follows: out of ~he $200 he from the Ill~no~s Department of Publ~c Aid, $150 went toward rent $10 for. gasoline for his truck, and $40 for food. In spite of this low monthly allocation for food, DCFS workers did not initiate any further inquiry into Madden's financial situation or into the medical condition of his children. Madden said his children were fine. On August 15, 1977, Joanne Johnson of Galesburg contacted Joap Kelly, who assigned the case to Debra Alstedt. Johnson said that during her frequent visits from Madden and his children, she had seen Madden mistreating Tina and Alan. She said she had seen both childr.en with black. eyes, and Alan with stitches on his fore\u00adhead. On August 19, Madden vi$ited the Galesburg DCFS office with both children. He told caseworker Kelly that his locksmithing dip~oma,was ~n its way and that he believed he had a job pending del~ver~ng p~zzas. He requested care for his children during his proposed working hours. Although Madden's schedule was somewhat difficult to accomodate, Kelly finally located a DCFS-approved home at which the children could stay while Madden was at work. On the day he was to begin working, August 22i Madden was told he could bring his children to\u00b7 the home of Mrs. Barbara Price of Galesburg, and Tina and Alan arrived there at 4:45 that afternoon. La~er that same afternoon, Mrs. Price's daughter Betty brought both ch~ldren to the Galesburg DCFS office. The Prices had dis\u00ad covered that Alan was brUised and had difficulty moving without pain. Both children had bruised backs and thighs. Alan also' had swollen and reddened feet, visible scars from areas previously stitched, severe diaper rash, and an i.nfected laceration on the back of his head. The Prices brought the children to DCFS imme\u00ad diately so that they would riot be accused of having ~nflicted these injuries upon the children. Kelly contacted the Galesburg Area Administrator, Ronald Noorman, who advised her to contact the police and take Alan to a hospital for emergency room treatment. Kelly took Alan to Cot\u00ad tage Hospital, whi.1\u00b7e Galesburg police officer Barrigan went to bring in Mr. Madden. . (, Alan was examined in the hospital's emergency room by a Dr. Heffman( who remarked that he had seen the boy there before. Mean\u00ad while, Betty Price returned home and brought Tina to the hospital for an .examination, also. The doctor noted that Tina's condition was less seriOUS, but that she did have a bruised leg, insects -2(39-~ __ ~~,....-----\"\"'7\"\"!\"\"\"'~------ --------- in her scalp, and a severe rash. He completed a suspected child abuse report and both children were admitted. Officer Barrigan brought Madden to the hospital e Madden said he did not know how the children had been injured, but hinted that either his sister or his girlfriend was responsible. Barrigan had found Madden at home. Supposedly the person who had promised him the delivery job had not been at work, so Madden had simply gone home. Attached to the DCFS case record are copies of the referral from the Prices, the report filed with the State Central Registry, and Dr. Hoffman's report. On August 23 Kelly called Assistant State's Attorney John pepmeyer of the K~OX County State's Attorney's,Office, who agreed to file a petition for temporary custody of the Madden children, and a hearing was scheduled for 3:30 that afternoon. At noon however, Cottage Hospital called Kelly to inform her Madden w~s at the hospital demanding the releas.e of the chil\u00ad dren. When Kelly arrived at the hospital, Madden, apparent~y very upset, told her he had been 'Iset up\" with the abuse allegat~ons. Kelly and police officers presen't told Madden he would, be able to present his side of the story at the afternoon hear~ng. At this time, pictures of the children's bruises were taken. At the hearing6 Kelly testified, and the pictures taken were shown as evidence. Judge William K. Richardson granted DCFS tem\u00ad porary custody and the next hearing was set for September 13. Tina and Alan were placed in foster care the next day; ~adden was notified of the placement and. was encouraged to visit the children be\u00a3,ore the next hear ing iI. Madden did visit his children twice 'in early September, with a DCFS worker supervising. On October 14, 1977 1 Jud~t~ ~udwig met with Madden and his attorney to discuss the poss~b~l~ty of returning the children to their father. Ludwig suggested coun\u00ad seling for Madden and provided him with ~h~~am~ and phon~ number of a suitable facility. A schedule of v~s~ts w~th the ch~ldren was also developed, but Madden failed to make the first visit and also failed to call to cancel it. Another appointment was later made for october 18, but Madden again failed to appear. No other information is contained in the case fil,e between October 18, 1977 and January 30, 1978, except that DCFS had re\u00ad ceived several phone calls before the 18th from Pam~la Madden~ who had been notified of an ,October 12 custody hear~ng, to wh~ch she did not respond. There is 'no record of the status of the chil\u00ad dren in foster care and no list of visits DCFS workers may have made with the children. Ludwig's January 30, 1978 ,case notes ref17ct a phone call she received from Pamela Madden from her home ~n Aurora, G~lorado. Pamela expressed interest in regaining custody of her children, -240-i l if 1 t; \". I j , , claiming she had enrolled in child care classes and had been tak\u00ad ing care of the son of the man she lived with; James Crain, with whom she had di~cussed marriage. She had also discussed with her attorney the possibility of moving the children to Colorado. Ludwig told Mrs. Madden that this would be difficult since she would have to have several' successful visits with the chil\u00ad dren to regain custody. The possibilities of Mrs. Madden's moving back to Illin0is and of placing the children in foster care in Colorado were mentioned. Ludwig suggested Madden contact the Knox County State's Attorney's Office and her own attorney for answers to her many questions about having given up her rights to the chil\u00ad dren. Ludwig agreed to come up with suggestions on how Madden might best recontact Tina and Alan, and set up a weekly time at which Pamela could speak with Ludwig on the telephone. During early 1~~8, Ludwig attempted to contact Gerald Madden, who had not been seen' since the October 12, 1977, court hearing. On February 1, 1978, Ludwig spoke with a relative of Madden's, Charles Kruger, who told her Madden had moved from his apartment on the afternoon of October 12, and, that he had heard Madden had moved to California. Kruger expressed an interest in attending the next court hearing in place of Gerald, ,but Ludwig told him the judge would have to decide about that. She told Kruger both of the children's pa~ents should have shown a more active interest in them if they had wished to retain custody. During March and April of 1978, hearings continued concerning the children. On March 16, an attorney representing Pamela Madden was present in court~ On April 12, neither Pamela Madden nor her attorney was present in court and Judge Richardson continued the case to October 17, 1978. The judge ordered DCFS to initiate a thorough home study of Pamela Madden and to present the results of the study to the court in October On June 22, 1978, DCFS made formal application to the Colorado Department of Social Services requesting a home evaluation of Pamela Madden, who lived in Denver at the time, to detertnine her ability to care for her children. The Galesburg DCFS office was to be the recipient of the evaluation. nSocial service agencies are able to request such studies as the result of states entering into legal, contractual agreements known as Interstate compacts that provide jurisdictional reach beyond state boundaries. I.llinois and most other states have en\u00ad tered into such an agreement for social servic~ and child protec-tive purposes. . ,. (\"\" We determined tha't all of the eva'luative forms authorities \\'lere sent to DCFS on Dec.ember 6, 1.978. states that \"approval is not granted\" for return of to Pamela Madden's care. from the Colorado The cover sheet the children Portions of a long letter to Ludwig' from Nancy Feldman, Intake Worker for the Denver Department of Social Services, are revelatory -241-a au 'P \"'. , l ~, , ! \",Ii and particularly significant in light of the final decision to return the children to Pamela Madden's care: Ms. Berg [Pamela Madden] recalls the last time she and her chil\u00ad dren (Alan and Tina Madden) lived together was in February of 1976. At that time she went to prison and the children went into foster care. Alan was six months old then. Ms. Berg feels she and Alan never really ~new one another as she and Tina did. When she w~s released from prison, Alan and Tina were living with their father, Gary [sic] Madden. ~s. Berg lived nearby and was able to see the children, but did not spend time with them. Alan and Tina were eventually removed from Mr. Maaden's home in August of 1977. Ms. Berg now feels she is able to care for Alan and Tina. S~e feels she is the most suitable person to take care of the c~:~l\u00ad dren and, as their mother, has a right to the children. shEL~:~ d<;lesn't know what to expect from Alan, but states she expects \"\" T~a won't be much different from two years ago. She doesn't foresee any problems with regards to adjustments in their lives. They would just have lIa good old time together like we used to.\" These expectations appear quite unrealistic. Ms. Berg is presently pregnant which adds another dimension. Ms. Berg feels Alan won't remember who she (Pam) is, but doesn't expect any problems from him. She also does not anticipate any problems between the newborn child, Alan and Tina. It would appear Alan, Tina, and Ms. Berg will have to make considerable adjustments in their lives without a ne\\>lborn child, and with l/ the newborn, the adjustments become magnified. Again, Ms. Berg's expectations don't appear rea,listic. ,.; Ms. Berg stated that she is presently living 9J;r: her savings. When asked about supporting herself, as well as three children, she stated she would get a job, when the baby was six months old or so. In the meantime, she plans on applying for assis\u00ad tance. In ,,'terms of employment, Ms. Berg would pre~er a night job so she could be with the children duringtte day. She hadn't thought 'about day care, but states it is'a\",possibility. \\ The unborn child is out-of-wedlock. When speaking about him/ her, I-ls. Berg's affect appeared wrong'. She would speak about \"unloadingll the baby in the beginning of Qctober, and did not appear to be looking forward to the baby being mll,her life. She would speak the words, but her affect did not agree. This worker respectfully recommends the children not be placed in the home of Ms. Pamela Berg. It is this worker's opinion \" that Ms. Berg will have enough to deal with upon the arrival of h~r unborn child. The arrival and newness of Alan and Tina may just add to the confusion. Alan 'and Tina are her natural children, however, Ms. Berg herself admits she and Alan never knew one another. These children have known only instability, neglect and abuse in their short ~ives. Ms. Berg, as well as -242-'\\ --~;:,. Alan and Ti'na would have to make considerable, adjustments and this worker does not feel these have been looked at realisti\u00ad cally by Ms. Berg. ShQdenies all charges of past abuse and does not show evidence of making changes in her life. In addi\u00ad tion, this worker did not feel Ms. Berg was honest during the interview as she appeared quite manipulative. In addition, three children may be a great financial burden on her after only needirfg to care for herself. The case had been heard again in court on October 17 1978 Neither Gerald nor Pamela Madden had appeared. Judge Richardso~ had set another hearin.g for November 9, 1978, for a status i~t::'\"Qort. Following the o.ctober hearing, caseworker Ludwig met with ASA'John p~pmeyer and Judge Keith Sanderson, for an \"informal hearing\" to dl.sCUSS the status of the Madden case. Judge Sanderson recommended having a hearing in two or three weeks, with notice furnished to everyone involved in the case. ASA Pepmeyer was to have prepared a petition to present to the court requesting that DCFS be given consent to arrange adoption. Ludwig felt at the time that DCFS probably would be granted adoptive rights to the children. Her case notes go on to clarify ASA Pepmeyer's preparations for the ~ear~ng to indicate that while he was to have a petition ready, l.t ml.ght not be presented at the next hearing; the next hearing would be for presentation of a status report first, with all par\u00adties and their attorneys notified. Commission investigators determined from their document re\u00ad view that Ludwig filed an annual report on the Madden children with the Knox County Circuit Court. This report, written before the Oct9ber hearing, reflects that Ludwig expected Pc3,mela Madden to be prel3ent at the hearing and expected to be able'to present the information from the\" Colorado agency then, also. She says both she and the Colorado agency shared c9ncern about the possi\u00adbility of the children being returned to,. Mrs. Madden in light of her past history of apuse, but that the court would probably order the chil~ren returned to the mother unless thE:! Colorado agency reconunen'ded otherwise. Ludwig again mentions the necessity of visitation prior to returning the children to Mrs.. Madden and the possibility of adoptioq. Ludw.ig apparently expected the court to place a great deal of significance on Mrs. Madd~n's failure to appear at previous hearings even though she was available, and she reiterates that much of the o~tcome of the proceedings depended upon the Colorado report. On November 3, 1978, Pamela Madden again contacted Ludwi9 toas~ about her children. Ludwig informed her of the next court hearing, but told her that her rights had been terminated because she had not been present at any of the hearings. Madden responded that she ,~ould not fight the:! court's deciSion. Ludwig told her that the children were doing fine in foster care and would be\" moved along to adoptive care. Madden final,ly added that she had given birth to a girl, Nicole, on October 22. Again, Commission ~taff were unable to find any documents describing the \"care of the children in their foster home, nor did .', we discover any notes or reports that indicated foster care was being monitored. -243- /i a QJ 7Q2 I 1 In our documen.t review, we did come across an annual report covering the period August 1, 1978 to August 1, 1979, prepal;\"ed by caseworker Dorothy Mason and submitted to the Knox County Cir\u00ad cuit Court on August 30< 1979. Her comments follow: Nothing has been done through the court since the Interstate Report was received from Colorado in Febr.uary,.1978. Colorado would not approve placement with natural mother. However, a, Court Hearing was never held to present that information. I would still like to see these children placed for adoption. DCFS staff have repeatedly requested a Hearing on this matter since February, 1979, in the interest of a permanent plan for these children. Pamela Madden apparently regained interest in having her chil\u00ad dren returned to her, and after several hearj.ngs, Judge Richardson on May 27, 1980 determined that Mrs. Madden's parental rights should not be terminated and that DCFS should arrange for home visits between Madden and her children. Had the children not been even\u00ad tually returned to their mother, they would not have endured fur\u00ad ther abuse and Alan would not have been killed. The judge's de\u00ad ciSion follows in full: It is the conclusion of the Court .. t:hat the parental rights ,of Pamela Madden Berg should not be terminated. The Court would feel compelled to reach this decision because of the sorry state of the record, if for no other reason. The Court does tlot exculpate itself for its responsibility for this faulty record. A petition was filed in both cases on August 23, 1977 alleging abuse--an allegation applicable to the Respondent Gerald Madden, and not to Pamela Hadden Berg, whose address was listed as un\u00ad known. Pamela was served with cqpies of these Petitions on September 20. On September 22, 1977, after securing leave of Court, Amended Petitions were filed alleging that the children were living in an environment injul,\"iolls to their welfare. There is no proof of notice in the file of this hearing, wQ,ich was held on october 12, 1977. The father, Gerald Madden, was present, and the Court found that he had punished the children in an abusive manner and that as to him, the children were neg\u00ad lected. Pamela Berg was not present. She stated Mr. pepmeyer told her it was not necessary for her to appear. Mr.. Pepmeyer denies he told her this, but did testify that in his conversa\u00ad tion with her prior to the October 12th hearing, such conversa\u00ad tion concerned itself with Gerald's conduct, and he did decide to call her as a witness. In the light of this, the Court feels that Mrs. Berg may have been under a misunderstanding as to there being any ~eason for her to appear, nor any realization that there would be a finding as to her that the children were neglected. Subsequent status reports were scheduled, and althqugh actual notice may have been given, the Court file does not reflect proofs of no~ice of the hearings'. -244-f f I I I (\\=had and On November 9, 1978, with neither Respondent, parent, nor the Guardian ad Litem present, the causes were continued to Dec. 7, 1978 and people instructed by Judge Sanderson to give no\u00ad tice of their intent to ask for adoption rignots. Such a Peti\u00ad tion was not filed until November 13, 1~79. This review.of the Court proceedings would make it appear that the termina\u00ad tion of Pamela Berg's parental rights would be based on a re\u00ad cord which would not stand close scrutiny. The Court agrees with the Guardian ad Litem that the finding of neglect very well may not be a Valid order as to Pamela. Assuming it should be considered a valid orde~, the Court can\u00ad not concur that Pamela has shown a lack of interest in her chil\u00ad dren. In February of 1978 she notified the Department of her intention to secure custody of her children. She employed counsel for this purpose, and if he failed to exercise proper diligence, Pamela should not be penalized. In July of 1978 she called from Colorado advising of her change of address and asking about a h,ome study. On November 3, 1978 she made a phone call inquiring about the children. It is not contradicted that she maintained medical insurance on the children. She was never told where the children were located. She was not granted per\u00ad mission to visit her children. It was testified that visita\u00ad tion would have been granted if requested. Ms. Mason further testified that she would not initiate any suggestion for visi\u00ad tation, nor did 'she now think it would be in the best interest of the children. While Mrs. Berg has been ineffectual and spasmodic in her ef\u00ad f,orts to maintain a degree of interest in her children, neither has she received any guidance or help in doing so. In the case of In re overton, Ill. App. Brd. 1014 at p. 1019, the Court states \"In regard to Colene\"s visitation, we note that while Colene's case worker did not expressly refuse Colene's right to visit her children, he did not encourage her to Visit the children. It is apparent from the case recoJ:d that the case worker felt it was in the best interests of the children that Colene should not visit them and that his feeling was communi~ cated to Colene\". The same attitude exists in the instant case. It would appear from this opinion in the Second District that the Appellate 'Court puts the onus on the Department to encourage visitations and other efforts to reestablish parent-child rela\u00ad tionship. The petition accordingly is denied, and the Department is in\u00ad structed to initiate a program, commencing with visitations, which ultimately will culminate, if all goes well, -in return of the custody of the children to Pamela Berg. Please prepare an Order. I would suggest a conference among the three of you and Ms. Mason to spell out the program of viSitations. Although the Knox County Stat~'s Attorney, on behalf of DCFS, cited both Pamela Maddep's 1976 surrender of parental rights the results of the Colorado home stUdY in his brief filed in -~45-a 4; 7 .. I i =t= .. this matter, the judge in his decision inexplicably failed to address these two factors. In addition to this brief, two others had been filed in this matter-~one by Pamela Madden's attorney and one by the Guardian Ad Litem. As explained in our chapter on legal issues, the Guardian Ad Litem represents the best interest of the child(ren) in proceedings such as this~ In its brief, the Guardian argued that Madden's parental rights should not be terminated, and that steps should be taken to place custody of Alan and Tina with the mother. However, it was stated in this latter brief that termina\u00ad tion of Pamela Madden's parental rights would have been recommended if their foster parents were ready to adopt Alan and Tina. After Judge Richardson issued his decision, Pamela Madden moved from Galesburg to Quincy, Illinois. Dorothy Mason wrote an inter-officememorandUln to the Team Leader of the Quincy Fie1d Office on June 30, 1980, enclosing a copy of Judge Richardson's decision. She mentions that the Departmental plan developed in Galesburg was to initiate a series of overnight visits between the chilqren and their mother to begin in August, 1980. Mason requests in her memo that someone from the Quincy office be with the family during these visits and provide the Galesburg office with a written summary of the contacts, including \"observations relating to appropriate space and care of children, and also, ad\u00ad justments by children into mother!s horne.\" Mason also requests \"courtesy supervision of this family\" because she still was re\u00ad quired to make status reports to the court in Galesburg. A memo in response to Mason's request dated July 18, 1980, and written by Amy Anderson, Supervisor of the Quinc~ Field Office, indicates that she visited Pamela Madden on July 15. She mentil.)ns in the memo that Madden expected her children to move in with her by August 22 and that she had last seen her children in Galesburg on July 1 '1. The first planned visit to Quincy was scheduled for August 7. The memo also notes 'that Madden had rented a six-rooID1 house \"with plenty of beds\" ahd that \"Pa~ plans to take Tina and\u00b7 Alan to stores and parks during their visits.\" Another memo, also to Mason and from Anderson, is dated Aug\u00ad ust 12, 1980: it is a formal response to Mason's memo of June 30, 1980. The memo mentions that Madden had planned at that time on marrying again. Her intended husband was \"Dean Fanucchi,\" her landlord, but she planned on delaying the weddin9 for about a year so that the children could get used to him. Anderson ffelt that there was plenty of sleeping room at the home. She closes her memo by stating that the next visitation would occur on August 15 and that if the children \\>lereplaced with their mother, her off ice would maintain courtesy supervis j,on. The follow,:ing para\u00ad graph is the only substantive indication of conversatiO,n with Pamela Madden concerning her interaction with the chilq,ren: Ms. Berg said the, three children got along pretty well but there were some discipline proplems since the children were not used to being with their mother. They commented that they would go back to their foster home if they didn,It get what they wanted. Ms. Berg discussed the discipline problem with me but stated -246-. II // I she understood it would take time for eve:tyone to adjust. She said she would not use phJtsical punishment on her children ex\u00ad cept for a light spanking II if necessary. The three children seemed to get along well and be happy. Tina tried to act like the mother of the whole group. Ms. Berg expects to have the most problems adjusting with ~lan since he was so young when they were separated. The next record of DCFS involvement with the Madden family ref lects events occurring around October 17, 1980, after the chil\u00ad dren had been returned to Pamela Madden. On October 17, the Quincy Police Department received an anonymous call alleging that Alan Madden had a bruised face. The police called DCFS, and Quincy Office caseworker Mary Butler was assigned the case for follow- up. She made several unsuccessful attempts to contact Pamela Madden,. and finally called the Quincy Police Department to tell them she had been unable to reach the woman. Butler was unaware at this time that there was any open case on the family, the mother, or the children. On October 19, 1980, Jack Cosgrove of the Quincy Police De\u00ad partment visited the Madden home and viewed the bruises that Alan had sustained. His mother explained that Tina was very rough with him and had pushed him off the jungle gym at school about two weeks earlier. The children confirmed the story and Cosgrove told the mother that he would still be contacting DCFS about the matter. The Commission obtained the official Quincy Police Department record of this contact. The report reads that CPS worker Kathleen Cherington, who had originally taken the October 17 abuse report call from the police, had requested the police visit the )1adden horne over the weekend because DCFS workers had been unable to get a response during th~ir visits to the horne. The rest of the re\u00ad port repeats that Mrs. Madden explained to the police officer the incident at school as well as her entire history with DCFS, going back to the father's neglect of the children and the support she was receiving at the time from Child Welfare (CW) worker Mary Carroll. She even mentioned the custody problem that was to be fesolved in court. The report concludes with this sentence: \"I feel this situation should be closely monitored because we may have an abu\u00ad sive parent here, it might be wise to check with the school and the: doctor also the other D.C.F.S. office where Pam came from.\" On October 20, 1980,Cherington called the police, who ga.ve her basic background information on the family and promised to send her the police report within the week. On the same date, Cherington received a tel~9hone call from Richard Baldwin, the(' principal of the school bo'th Madden children attended. He ask,ed that Cherington come to the school to have a look at Alan Madden, who had just returned to school, after about a week of ab~ences, with bruises around his eyes. Cherington spoke with Alan in Baldwin's office. Alan told her that his sister beat him, which Tina admitted. ~ina also told Cheringtoh that she had knocked Alan off the jungle gym, although there is no record of the incident in school records. \" -247-'. FA 44 , .. The same day, Cherington visited the Madden horne. Pamela Madden told her that when Alan fell off of the jungle gym she called a Dr. Lovell at the Family Practice Center and followed his instruc~ tions to put ice on Alan's head and watch for signs of concussion. Cherington told us that the mother exp+ained her DCFS Galesburg history to her also and the two discussed appropriate forms of discipline. We were able to examine Cherington's case sUfiwary as requested by her superiors in DCFS after Alan Madden died. The following two statements are taken from her summary of the October 20, 1980 contact: Alan stated that Tina beats on him and that was how he received the bruises on his stomach and back. He could not explain how he r~ceived the bruises on his arm and the topside of his hands. We discussed methods of handling this aggressiveness and various forms of discipline. She stated that the bruises on Alan's arms and hands were due to \"rough house\" play in which she would pick up Alan by his arms and throw him onto the bed. On October 22, 1980, Cherington visited Dr. Lovell, who told her that he had been satisfied with Mrs. Madden's version of how the injuries to Alan had occurred. He also regarded Mrs. Madden as a very responsible mother, based on her following his instruc\u00ad tions in caring for Nicole, the youngest child. Cherington also learned during her visits to the school and the doctor that Alan had not been treated immediately after he fell off of the jungle gym, that no formal allegation of abuse was filed by the school : principal, and that the name listed on the bottom of the school registration card in the box marked \"relative\" was the name \"Jim Crain. \" . I On November 5, 1980, Baldwin called Cherington again to teil i. her that Tina reported that her \"dad\" had kicked her in the stoma~h. Alan agreed that this had happened. When Mary Carroll called Pamela Madden, she told her that Tina admitted making up the story in order to get out of school because she did not feel\"well. On the salUcdate, Mrs. Madden called Cherington to repeat the same story, and also to com:glain that Tina had been waking up at night screaming, \"Daddy hurt me.\" Mrs. Madden claimed that Tina had done the same thing when they lived in Galesburg. During this conversation, Cherington asked if she could meet Dean Fanucchi, Mrs. Madden's supposed fiance. An appointment to that effect was set for November 7. On November 6, Mrs. Madden called caseworker Carroll to tell her that Tina .had chicken pox; the foliowing day, the appointment to meet Mrs. Madden's fiance was cancelled because of Tina'G ill\u00ad ness. Cherington called back on November 10, but was unable to reschedule the meeting. On November 12, Cherington learned from Dorothy Mason of'the Galesburg DCFS office that the Quincy office had received only -248-I J I I ~ , r I I ~{ -\"..:; . i ! i~ II .'~ .. 1 I c;>n:,report of neglect regarding Tina prior to Alan's birth. Mason l.nOl.cated that a court review date to determine guardianship had not yet been set. Cherington visited the Madden household on November 13 1980 and not~d in her records an improvement in the relationship'be- ' tween,Tl.~a and Alan. The following day, Cherington contacted Alan and,Tl.na s former foster parent, who confirmed Tina's aggressive attl.tude toward her brother. On November 24, 1980, Cherington spoke again with Dorothy Maso~ and learned more about the Madden's case history in Galesburg. Cherl.ngton learned of the two neglect findings concerning Tina, the removal of ,;the children from Gerald Madden, placement of the children in foster care, and Pamela Madden's surrender of parental rights. We determined through our review of DCFS records that referenc~ to adoptive surrenders is made in Cherington's case notes but not l.n her summary of the case requested by her superiors after Alan Madden was found dead. . Supposedly, Cherington called Pamela Madden on December 11 1980, and discussed the children's behavior. Madden said that' the children were Jnaking a good adjustment to both her and to Quincy and that she had not had to spank them even once. This entry byCherlngton is not in her case notes but does appear in the final summary. . like cept than ~n Dece~~r 17, ,Cheringtol1 called Madden to see if Tina might ~o partl.cl.pate l.n a community event. She was happy to ac\u00ad but told Cherington that the family would be away for more a week on \"Dean's farmll during the holidays. The next DCFS contact with the Maddens ocurred on January 11, 1981, when Martha Butler received a call from James Rost of the Quincy Police Department reporting that Alan Madden was dead. ~n January 11, 1981, a flurry of activity occurred. Tina and Nl.cole Madden were placed j.n emergency foster care. Pamela Madden was arrested for the death of her son Alan, as was a IIfriend\" of hers, James Crain. DCFS officials began a series of telephone calls to the SCR and to each other to determine what to do about the case. Alan Madden's body was taken to the coroner's office for an autopsy. The following account, recorded by James Rost, is in actual\u00ad i~y a very small portion of the Quincy Police Department's offi\u00ad Cl.al records on the case, and it presents one perspective of all of the immediate events occurr:lng just prior to Alan Madden's death: '. In talking with Pam about the things that happened to Allan [sic] prior to his death, she told me the following: Pam said that Jim [James Crain] came over Saturday (01-10-81) around 1400 hours. She said that he was in and out of the \"-249-sa 4; ** house after this. Pam said that the only persons present in the hous~ all day up to Alan's death was her, Jim Crain, Nicole, and Tina. They had no other visitors at all in the home that day. Pam said that Alan got out of bed Thursday without asking, and she questioned him as to why he got up without asking permis\u00ad sion from hero Pam sa~d that Alan told her that he wanted to play with his sister, and Pam said that she knew he was lying, and not telling her the truth why he got up. Pam said that she asked Alan again why he got up, and this time Alan did not answer her question at all. Pam said that she was real mad at Alan for lying to her about the question (IIWhy did you get out of bed? II), so she punished him for this. I asked what the punishment was, and she said that she put him in his bed and made him stay there. Pam said that this was at 2100 hours on Thursday evening (01-08-81), and he was made to stay there until Saturday 01-10-81 when she had Tina get him up at 1900 hours. Pam said that during this time he was being punished he was not permitted to eat or drink anything, and had to stay in bed all the time. She did let him up only to go to the bathroom. Alan was also kept out of school all of the week of 01-05-81 through 01-09-81 because she did not want the teachers at Washington School to see his badly bruised right eye. Pam said that when she entered the living room and bedroom area (same area) that WKRP (a television program) was just start- ing. She told Tina to go get Alan out of his bed, and for him to come to her. Tina at first yelled real loud \"Alan come here.\" Pam said that Jim got onto Tina for yelling and told Tina \"Tina, your mom could have done that. What she wants you to do is go get him.\" Tina then went to get Alan. Pam said t~at when Tina and Alan came into the livingroom that Alan came up to her and stood in front of her. She (Pam) was sitting on the couch. Pam said that Alan asked her what she wanted, and Pam said that she again asked Alan why he did not answer her question on Thursday, and Alan said \"I didn't get up or dressed\",. Pam said that she hit Alan after he said this, and told him that he was lying, and she wanted the truth. She asked him several times over and over to answer her question, and when Alan stammered around trying to answer, she would each time hit Alan ~ithher hand. Pam said that she would ask the question of Alan and then hit him, ask the qUElstion of Alan, and then hit, etc; etc; etc;. Pam said that she repeatedly struck Alan after each time she asked the question. I asked Pam how long she did this to Alan, and she said that. this lasted for about 15 minutes. While she hit on Alan, Tina was made to stay on the end of the couch, and see all of this taking place. She thinks it bothered Tina to see her brother getting hit. -250- ~ l:J.~ :t ~ .. I t f !. j' /, i !. I h it II p 'j r~'\u00b7 h ! r; I l' f' \\ F r r f: '\\ lot J' 11 q 11 ~ t f, l: a i ~ { 1 I I j ~ ! When this question and hitting on Alan was taking place Pam said that she made Alan stand directly in front of her, and she was sitting on the couch. Jim was on the mattress watch\u00ad ing, and hearing what was taking place, and Tina was on the couch next to Pam. Nicole was said to have been in bed asleep. Pam also said that the hitting she did was mostly on his rump area, and the more she asked the question, the more she got carried away, and hit harder. I a$ked Pam what answers Alan gave each time she asked the question of why he got out of bed, and she said that Alan did not give h~r any true or full an\u00ad swers, he would just stutter saying things like \"well, uh, I, uha,\" and things like this. Pam said that she could not ac\u00ad cept the answers and kept it up, until about 2000 hours which was a hour after she started. Pam said that she wore herself out hitting on Alan, and Jim took over for her. She went in and got Nicole out of bed, and sat back on the couch with Tina. Pam said that she also told Alan \"I'm getting mad, and I'm going to give you a good one if you don't answer me\". I asked Pam again where she hit Alan with her hand, and she said I started hitting him on the rump, but after that 'where it hit; it hit\". Pam said that when Jim first started on Alan, that he just got up off the m~ttress, and hit Alan with his hand. Jim, after hitting him the first time said \"Why don't you answer your Mother?\", and before Alan could say anything, Jim started hit\u00ad ting him some more. Pam said that Jim kept hitting, and hit\u00ad ting Alan, and she did not know how many times at first. Pam said that Alan was crying, and screaming real loud, and it staT-ted to get to her. She said that she did watch for awhile, and it got to the point where she could not handle it so she started sewing on ~9me socks that needed mending. Tina said that the socks she was sewing belonged to Tina. Pam also said that she was doing this sewing on the couch in front of /where Jim Crain was beating her son, and that the two girls \\~ere still present. \\\"-.' ,) I asked Pam if she believed the beating that Alan was getting from her could have caused death or great bodily harm to Alan, and she, said that she believed it could have at the time she was hitting him. I asked Pam if she believed that Jim was doing great bodily harm to her son when she sat and watched Jim Crain beat Alan, and Pam said that she believed he was. I asked Pam how she could sit and sew socks while her son was being beaten in front of her. She said she did this to block out the beating Jim was giving Alan, and that she could not stand to watch it. -251-A QJ \u00a2P I asked Pam where Jim was hitting on Alan and she said that he was getting hit allover, t'lhere the hits would land is where he got it. I asked Pam if Jim used anything other than his hand such as clubs, or sticks,. and she said that she thinks he just used his hand, but she did not watch all of it. Pam said that she did look up, now and then, to see Jim beat\u00ad ing on Alan, and she heard Jim yelling and askli,g questio~s of Alan all the time it was going on. Pam also said that Jim would kneel down on the :floor, and with both hands holding Alan in the air would drop Alan with force onto and across his raised right knee. Pam demonstrated this. The victim was said to have been facing towards the floor each time that Jim brought him down across his knee. Pam said that the beating of&Alan was over about 2200 hours, which meant the victim was beaten for about three hours. When it was over Pam said that Alan was still alive, but he had a lot of bruises on him, that showed up. She. said that this bothered her because if the DCFS seen the bruises or if it was reported to them that they would come and take the kids away from her. Pam said that Jim took Alan to his bedroom, and she did not know if Alan walked or Jim carried him. Jim came back out of Alan's bedroom and had put Alan in hi~ bed. Pam said that af\u00ad ter Jim came into the living room after this she asked him if she should put Alan in cold water. This was to get rid of the bruises, and change the body temperature. Jim told Pam \"it's up to you to do what you think is best; I could have hit h~m too hard\", and \"too many times\". Pam went into the bathroom and ran cold water into the tub. She yelled at Alan to come to her, but got no answer. Pam said that Jim then came in with Alan in his arms. Pam said th~t she did not remember who undressed A1ani but both of them was in the bathroom. Pam said that they put Alan into the tub of water, and he was in the tub for about ten minutes. Jim was the one that took Alan out of the tub, and held him up while Pam put a yellowish\u00ad gold colored blanket around Alan. Pam said that sbe put a towel over Alan's head. Pam said that she took Alan into the living room and laid Alan down on the floor nezt to the register so the warm air would blow on him. \" Pam said that Alan would not talk to her, only stared at her. She also said that the ends of Alan's fingers were a bl'7~.sh color, and his eyes were white,-like. Pam said Alan laid-by the heat register for about five minutes, and she then took him ,'carri~d) to his bed again. -252-t 1\\ f r ! ! .. : ! 'I I , I Ji J Pam said that Alan was naked so she put some clothes on him. Pam said that she took Alan into the living room and laid him on the floor. She and Jim tried to get a temperature reading from Alan with a thermometer but could not get a reading. She then though~ the thermometer was not working right. Pam said that she and Jim watched wrestling on T.V. and it was over about 0100 hours (01-11-81). Pam said that they checked on Alan between 0100 and 0115 hours, and she knew that Alan was dying at the time. She took an electric blanket and wrapped it around Alan and turned it on. She said.that she told Jim that she knew Alan was dying, and that she could not stand to watch it happen so she was going to lay down. Pam said that,. she told Jim to set the alarm to go off in one hour, and that he was to wake her up when Alan was dead. Pam said that she did lay down and go to sleep lIDtil Jim woke her up at about 0200 hour (01-11-81). Pam went to where Alan was, and got down on the floor by him. She said that she gave Alan mouth to mouth resuscitation and CPR, but it did no good. She then took a stethascope that she had to get a heart beat, but could not get one. .Pam said that she looked up at Jim and said liMy god I think he,,' s dead\". Pam said that she told Jim to call an ambulance because we need some help. She said that Jim did and the police and ambulance came. Pam said that the police brought her and Jim in them for ques\u00adt:i.oning After I got th~ough questioning Pam I went into the interroga\u00ad tion room where Sgt. Griffin and DeVoss were talking with Jim Crain. I asked Jim if he still understood what his Rights w~re and h~ said yes. I then told hi4:: who I was, and wanted to ask him somet~,ing. Grifl:.i.H and DeVoss \\\"ere still present. I told Jim that he was under arrest for the murder of.Alan Edward Madden age 5, and asked him if he understood the charges. He stated yes. I then asked Cra'in if he knew he was hitting the victim, Alan Madden, that the hitting could have induced great bodily harm, and likely death. Crain looked at me for a moment, and stated \"Yes, I did \". I\" l~ft and lodged Pam in the County jail in lieu of bond for the charge of murder. In we will Crain. order. to balance this narrative presented by Pamela Madden, now present selections from the interrogation of James These statements were recorded by detective Michael DeVbss. Crain was interviewed on January 11, 1981, and was told that Madden had told the police of her involvement in Alan's death and had implicated Crain in the beatings. Crain responded, \"I'll tell the truth; what do you want to know?\" When DeVoss asked Crain -253-. \\ about the reasons for the beatings, Crain claimed that Alan was being punished by Madden and that he had been in'bed all day as part of the punishment. He said that the reason Alan was being punished was that he had not, answered a question directed to him by his mother. Crain said that the question that Alan could not answer was, \"What was the question I asked you yesterday?\" Crain said that periodically throughout the evening he would go back ,to where Alan's bed was and ask him 'the question, to which Alan could only mumble a reply. Crain admitted to police that he did not even know what the original question had been. He said that every time that Alan was unable to answer the question, he hit him. The police asked Crain to demonstrate the kind of blows he used; he backhanded Alan with an open hand held Slightly curled. He demonstrated the blows to the police on a wall in police head\u00adquarters. After each blow, Crain would return to the living room to continue to watch television. Crain said that with each blow, Alan would normally not fall down. When he did, Crain would pick him back up. Crain told police that he thought he was using \"rea\u00adsonably soft blowsll and that he did not use anything other than his hand on Alan. Crain claimed that at no time during the beat\u00ad ing did he get angry, although he told police he felt that Alan giggled during the beating and did not understand that he meant bUSiness. Crain claimed that he was hitting Alan so that he would answer the question; if he answered the question, then he could come to the living room and watch wrestling on television with the rest of the family. When asked if Crain did not feel that being kept in bed for not answering a question was a bit ex\u00ad treme, he acknowledged that it was somewhat extreme. The police told Crain that Alan had sustained a broken rib. Crain denied breaking a rib and hypothesized that it had been btr:>\u00ad ken before the beating. Crain told police that he had had a cracked rib and that it hurt more after the event than when it actually cracks. Crain claimed that he never heard a bone snap or crack during the beating and he never heard Alan Scream in sud-den pain. 0 The police ask,ed Crain if he knew that Alan had been con\u00ad strained to his bed since January 8 at 5:00 p.m. and that he had not been fed. Crain claimed that he knew nothing about it; he had only noticed that, when he stopped at the house\"for lunch on Friday the 9th, Alan did not eat with the rest of the family. Crain said that it was not uncommon for Alan to spend a lot of time in bed because he liked to sleep. Crain did mention that when he came over for lunch, Alan never ate w:Lth the rest of the family .~.-:::.:::>' Crain was asked about bruises. Crain said that Alan had fallen in the bathtub two or three weeks earlier and that no doc\u00adtor was called because neither he nor Madden felt the injury was serious. When pressed, he admitted another reason no doctor was called was that they wer~ afraid of a DCFS investigation. -254-,,' \"', ;'\" ~ ..

She asked Tina if she could describe how her brother had gotten hurt (Jansen could not ascertain if Tina knew that her brother was dead, but she did not tell her). Tina replied that her \"daddy\" had kept hitting him in the stomach. When asked if he had used a flat hand, as demonstrated by Jansen, Tina said that it had been a fist. Tina made a fist to show Jansen what had happened. She also said that \"her dag~yh had thrown Alan onto his knee. Jansen did not understand thi~ '~scription at first and as~ed if Alan was on his ~nees. Tina\\ ~~ )id tha~ he was thrown onto h1.s knee and tha'c blood came\\;::;t of hlS mouth. Sgt. Jansen asked Tina if Alan had been'kept in bed cfor a long time, and she said that he had. She added that he had had nothing to eat but that she had given him a drink of water, with her mother's permission. When Jansen asked her why she did not take Alan something to eat, she replied that she did not want to qet hit. Jansen asked if her mother had hit Alan. At first, Tina did not reply, but eventually she said that her mother told Alan to stick his feet out of the bed and hit him on the feet. When asked what she hit him with, Tina mentioned a stick with tape wrapped around it. Then Tina said that her mother told her \"to give her the telephone. She did, and her mother hit Alan with the telephone mouthpiece on the feet and then on the head. Sgt. Janser. asked Tina if she knew why Alan was being hit. She replied that it was because he would not answer the question. When asked whi<;<h question she m~ant, she said it was somethi,ng about why he had gotten out of t~d. She said that he had answered the question; he had gotten out of bed to play with his sist.er. Sgt. Jansen examined a deep scab on Tina's back wpere she said her mother had kicked her. Then she adds this account: Tina told me that Daddy and Mama had put Alan in the bathtub. She said that his eyes were wide open and that Daddy had splashed ',' water into his face but that he did not blink. She said that Alan had rolled over in the water and that when they raised him up that his eyes were still open and that he had not blinked.

I I \u00b7Il. ., i -~ t I I:;.:.' .... I l' i I , i I l I II- I I Detective Gregory L. Scott wrote the Quincy Police Depart- ment report on the autopsy, performed by Dr. Zakiah S. Ali, a patho\u00ad logist, and assisted by Coroner Wayne Johnson and Laboratory Tech\u00ad nician Thomas Luctenburg. Before the autopsy began, Detective Scott counted bhe bruises and abrasions on Alan's body and stopped counting when he reached 170. The autopsy revealed that all of Alan's major organs, with the exception of the heart and lungs, had suffered extensive hemor\u00ad rhaging. The doctor found that 400 cc. of blood lay in the ab\u00ad dominal cavity; ha explained that a child Alan's siz.e should have about 500 cc. of bl00d in his entire body. Scott told the doctor that Madden mentioned that some of the bruising had occurred as a resultdf her attempts to perform cardio\u00ad pulminary resuscitation on Alan. Dr. Ali stated that there was no sign that CPR had been used on Alan and that there always will be some sign on both the heart and sternum if it has been done. Dr. Ali also stated that there was no way that the injuries that Alan had sustained could have been accidental or self-inflicted. Fourteen pictures were taken during the autopsy and four more were taken after Alan's body had been taken to a funeral home. The photographs reveal massive brain hemorrhage, kidney hemor\u00ad rhage, colon hemorrhage, and pancreas hemmorrhage both on the in\u00ad side and the outside. The photographs taken at the funeral home show severe bruising even in extremity areas, such as the feet. Soon after Alan Madden's death, DCFS Director Gregory Cole+ instituted disciplinary action against several Departmental employ\u00ad ees deemed by an i.nternal DCFS investigation to have failed the case in 9.~e or more ways. \\,-/ Dorothy Mason and Carol St. Amati both of the Galesburg Office, were accused of fa.ilure to transfer the Madden case file. Mason was suspended for two days without pay; St. Arnat was suspended for a single day without pay. \\\"\\ Indeed, one of the issues raised by this case is the ques\u00ad tion of appropriate DCFS' jurisdiction responsible for monitoring the Madden family. As we mentioned, caseworker Mason of the Galesburg office had to report to the court concerning the suita\u00ad bility of placement for the children with their 'natural mother. But she had to rely on Quincy DCFS staff to monitor the home situa\u00ad tion, speak with the mother, and supply her with written records. We asked both Carol St. Amat and Joan KellYI Galesburg caseworkers, j! the Madden case file had been transferred to Quincy. They told us that it had not been transferred because they interpreted DCFS rules to state that a case file should not be transferred unless ~ll business is complete from the original DCFS office, and Gales\u00ad burg still had contact with the family. They tOld us that as long as crit~cal issues faced the court--such as the father's rights to the children and giving the mother custody of the children-\u00ad the case file properly.belonged in Galesburg. The judge had not rendered a final decision prior t~the case being transferred. -257-a 4; ) Ij ,p According to both St. Amat and Kelly, DCFS policy is that a case should not be transf~rred until a disposition is reached. They mentioned that the case file could have been t~anSf'erred if the judge had ordered it to be transferred. r( \\\\, I, I , .I Z Both St. Amat and Kelly agreed that, in t11eir dpinion, there was nothing critical in the case file regarding P,timela Madden's past history or demeanor toward her children, while there was a good deal of important information about the conduct of Gerald Madden. Therefore, the file rightfully belonged in Galesburg, they reasoned. The Commission reviewed the applicable DCFS rules governing both transfer of cases and transfer of case files; the rules that we reviewed were applicable at the time the Madden case was pend\u00ad ing. They may have been amended since then. A portion of the \"Policy Governing Transfers\" (Rule 6.3.1) follows: Areas shall utilize written agreements to delineate service responsibility when more than one Area must be involved in ser\u00ad vice delivery. Areas shall also utilize written agreements when total responsi\u00ad bility (service and financial) is being transferred from one Area to another. Such agreements shalL be negotiated prior !2 the transfer and shall specify the proposed date of trans\u00ad fer (by the sending Area) and the acceptance date of transfer (by the receiving Area). A. When a family exists, the Area in which the family re\u00ad sides (home Area) will be responsible for se~~ice and financial planning. 1. Planning and payment responsibility shall remain together. 2. The Area i1'1 which the family resides has service and financial responsibility for all children from that family who are in purchased resources. In addition to private ~gency/institution resources this includes all state-operated facilities\" li\u00ad cenSed Department foster homes, relatives' homes, and independent living arrangements. DCFS Rule 6.3.2 is titled \"Case Record (File) Transfer\" and delineates circumstances governing transferral of physical case r~cords. The rule includes a comprehensive list, of the responSi\u00ad bilities of different DCFS staff to assur~ that the proper docu\u00ad mentation has been included in all transferred records. The im~ portant portions of this rule follow: . The case record (file) of a child shall remain with the Area providing services, even t,hough the \"home\" Area retains pay\u00ad ment responsibility. Housing and l1laintenani::e of the \"files\" should be agreed to in writing by the approp~iate Area adminis~ trators (i,.e., which Area etc .. ). -258-t'1, r' r' ,t I J I I I,') I () j When case records (files) are physically transferred, the Area initiating the transfer is responsible for assuring that the record(s) is/are in proper order. Kathleen Cherington was discharged from the Department, effec\u00ad tive February 3, 1981, for: failing to contact the State Central Registry about three separate abuse allegations; failing, in four separate ways, to complete and return the Child Abuse and Neglect Tracking System (CANTS) forms correctly; and failing to initiate an investigation of the October 17, 1980 abuse report within 24 hours. Cherington did not appeal her dis~harge because she became confused about filing dates. Martha Butler was suspended for three days for failing to call the State Central Registry regarding the October 17, 1980 incident. When we asked Butler about the disciplinary action taken, she told us that the community was demanding that something be done and that some type of action had to be taken against those heavily involved with the Madden case. However, she did not feel that any of the workers was incompetent in actual duties and men\u00ad tioned that the State Central Registry procedures of the Quincy office have changed at least a dozen times. She added that work\u00ad shops to explain the new reporting system have served to only fur\u00ad ther the confusion about reporting. When we asked Butler why she was unaware on October 17, 1980, that there was an open case on the Madden family, she responded that the case originally was referred to the Quincy office from, the Galesburg Office as a child welfare case and not a case for Child Protective Services. She added that the Child Welfare unit provides \"non-protective\" services such as family stress consul\u00ad tations, home studies, and adoptions. As Butler unq,erstood the case later, the Galesburg workers had requested that a home study be conducted so that the adoption and parental surrender issues could be settled in court in Galesburg. Toward that end, Child Welfare (CW) assigned caseworker Mary Carrall to coordinate ser\u00ad vices to the family. Butler added: \"There has always been ~,nter\u00ad action between CPS and the CW units at the Quincy office and later in the scenario Cathy Cherington who was assigned the case in CPS, did in fact communicate with Mary Carroll who had the case in the Child Welf.are Service Unit.. \" Furthermqre\" as Butler I s supervisor Timothy Morrell and Kathleen Cherington pOinted out, the bulk of information in the Madden file pertains to. Gerald Madden, the father, with very few references to Pamela Madden, the mother. They said that the case could not have b~en handled much differently and that Pamela Madden cou~d not, based on case history, have been considered a potentially abusive parent. Timothy Morrell was d;i.scharged from the Department effective Februa~y 11, 1981; he appealed his discharge to the Civil Service CommiSSion, which examined the specific charges against him (basi\u00ad cally the same charges as applied to Cheril'lgton) and: ruled in octoberf 1981, that fome charges had in responsi- -259-( <'< \\' ; ,? 1~ ~ , bility and others did not. It ruled that Morrell should have been suspended for 60 days without pay and reinstated him with the De\u00ad partment with the stipulation that he receive seven months' back pay. No disciplinary action was taken against Quincy DCFS case\u00ad worker Amy Anderson. Nevertheless, she resigned in protest against the firings of Cherington and Morrell. Originally, William Sheppard, once Field Service Supervisor in Springfield and responsible for the Quincy 0.ffice, was suspended for 30 days pending dismissal. Director Coler changed his mind in this case and levied the penalty of eight days without pay and demotion to Regional Planner in the Springfield Office. RalphL. Hannebutt, DCFS Regional Director, was reassigned to a nonsensitive job in the Springfield office. Investigators' reports showed that Hannebutt had spent less than 13 hours in Quincy during the entire previous year; Sheppard, the Field Ser\u00ad vices Supervisor, had spent less than 80 hours in the Quincy re\u00ad gion during that same time period. Commission staff were able to scrutinize the results of the \"Special Investigation Report: Alan Madden,\" conducted by the Department between January 16-19, 1981. The investi4ative team issued a 23-page report that included findings, conclusions and recommendations based on more than 60 interviews, six telephone interviews, and document revie~'l from DCFSrecords. The report states that the findings. and recommendations are the results of a concensus of opinion of the team members: \"This concensus was developed in several group meetings at which important issues were identified, findings presented and recommendations formulated with the approval of a majority of the team members. Issues, findings and recornmcndations with statewide applicabili-ty are identified in the report when appropriate.\" Twelve issues are identified in the report, most with appropriate applicable reconunendations suggested. We will review each o.f the tweJ.ve briefly. 1. T.he repo~t identifies weaknesses in the condition of case records. It criticizes the Galesburg records for lac;king formality,. and for the absence or inaccuracy of dates on entries. Both the Quincy and Galesburg records are criticized for missing informa\u00ad ti0I?-, and the investigatory team viewed these problems as sympto\u00ad mat~c of a general lack of \"proper supervisory review and evalu- !) ation of employee performance.\" The team recommends that workers be required to develop adequate social histories on clients and keep their records current, and that supervisors be required to review case fil\u20acs on at least a quarterly basis to assure compli\u00ad ance with Departmental regulatiqns and state law. 2. The next issue identified is inadequate representation by the State's Attorney's Office, particularly for failing to pre\u00ad pare adequately for court hearings, failing to notify the judge of Pamela l1adden' s signed surrenders which resulted in her impro\u00ad per inc\u00b7lus:Loh in the 1977 petition ~and the 1978 hearing, and fail- -260-I !} ure to take significant action in pursuing termination of parental rights for almost a year after DCFS requested such action. The team recommends that a) consents to adoption be irrevocable after 12 months without exception; b) abandonment be better-defined and grounds for termination of parental rights be made much looser; c) a finding of abandonment contain no clause stating that dili\u00ad gen.t efforts must be made by an authorized agency; and d) a DCFS attorney be appointed as liaison with the court and the State's Attorney's Office for the Springfield region. (The reader should refer to our chapter on legal issues for more information on these recommendations.) 3. The third is/sue the team addresses is that, \"Inappropriate court hearings were apnducted, and the presiding judge failed to acknowledge the surreI\\ders signed by Pam Madden, and failed to issue a Court Order.\" \"The report notes that there was no evidence to suggest that Pamela Madde~'s surrenders were ever voided, and claims that her subsequent involvement in matters concerning Tina and Alan was inappropriate. The t~~m considered its second issue recommendations to be pertinent to this issue, as well, but also expressed the hope thatojudges would more closely review court records in the future and suggested that DCFS assign trained at\u00ad torneys to work as court liaisons in every region in the state~ 4. The team said that there was inadequate follow-up by the Child W~lfare Services caseworker. The report sites her failure to obtain custody for DCFS before the children were placed in fos\u00ad ter care in February, 1976, and notes that the case file contains no\u00b7 record of any services pr\"c>,\\ided Gerald Madden when he regained custody of the children in May~~76. Recommendations include instructing all DCFS regions to COlllp.ly with the case transfer pro\u00ad visions of the Child Welfare Manual, \"'anQ,periodic review of cases by supervisory staff to correct staff mismanagement. 5. I'Failure to report abuse alleg~tions to the State Central Register and to complete required CANTS forms in a t'imely manner,\" are criticisms leveled in the fifth issue. The team found that both the Oc.tober.:17 abuse allegat;i.on an.d the report, of Alan's death were called in too late and that not once in DCFS's'involvement '. ~ with the Maddens was any reporter referred to the 800 number by I! the workers. The review team alleged that the CANTS form submitt~a on l~m~t~ng\\ SCR cross-referencing possibilities. Also, the team criticized . the amount of ti~e lapsed between filling out of CANTS forms by workers, the dates they were signed by supervisors, and the dates \u00b7they finally \\\\'\"ere submitted. The Quincy Office'~ overdue report .;, record was very poor, according to the teRm, as \\-l~~e the records of two of the workers associated with the case. Rl3c_QInIt\\en4cCi-: =~. tions emphasize timeliness, accuracy, and completeness-oaf CA1\\i'l'S - reports and increas~d use of the eoo hotline number. 0 6. According to the revievl team, \"'rhe lac~ of adequate manasre'\u00ad ment. oolicies 4\u00a3 \u00a5Qll effective administration of the Quincy office and the execution of staff responsibilities.\" Cited in this allegati~n were the small amount of time some administrators and superv1~ors.spent in Quincy the lack of a formal mechanism for commun1cat1on be\u00ad tween the'cPS and the Child Welfare workers assigned to ~he.Madden case and the lack of maintenance of basic caseload stat1st1cs need~d to make adequate judgments concerning case a~signment.and staff performance. Recommendations include disci~l~nary a~t1on against individuals previously identified, formal1z1ng offlC7 pro\u00ad cedures for sharing information between caseworkers d1f\u00ad ferent divisions, and that\u00b7 \"requirements for maintenan~e of basic management statistics should be formulated at the reg10nal level and disseminated to all field office supervisors.\" 7. Issue seven me~tions a lack of coordination of commu~ity resources and expertise in identifying, treating, and prevent1ng child abuse and neglect, and suggests that there is a ~eed for greater public awareness in Quincy. The team also dec1ded that the procedure followed by the staff at the Washington school \"may have thwarted the intent of the law \" The team recommends that all mandated reporters be made aware of th7ir r7spons~bil~ties; that law enforcement agencies conduct crim1nal 1nvest1gat7ons when appropriate, jOintly with DCFS in some cases; . that the Qu~.ncy DCFS office reach out to the community for profess1onal exp~rt1se a~d volunteer help; and that funding be prov~ded the QU1ncy off1ce to develop additional CPS treatment serV1ces. 8. The team's eighth area of criticism alleges that btoth d DCFS and the community devote too 'little time to managemen an treatment of child abuse and neglect. The team continu~s tha~ \"it is apparent that the worker is given far too much d~scret1on during the intake phase,\" and it criticizes workers' be1ng allowed to screen calls and deteTmine which should_be ref~~~ed to the.SCR. Also criticized is the worker's handling of the Madden cas7 w1th .. respect to doctor's opinion that Pam Madden's ~xpJ,anat1ons . of Alan's injuries were plausible. The report cla1ms the.worker should have obtained a second opinion from a doctor who d7d not .. ' already kn.ow the family, especially in light of the sever1ty al1? suspicious character of Alan's injuries. The team re~o~ends tnat supervisors playa larger role in case ma~agement.dec~slons and_ that the Springfield region aSsist the QU1ncy off1ce ~n develop ing community and contractual resources. It also adv1ses DCFS. to study the option of having \u00b7staff personally escort the .pos~lble abuse victim to examinatior. by a doctor unknown to the Ch1ld 1n order to ensure an impartial assessment. Also, the tea~ recom\u00ad mends that the medical community receive further educat10n about child abuse and its responsibility to report, and that all CPS workers be required to participate in CPS training no matter when they were hired. 9. The ninth issue is that, nei~h7r t:p~~ BCfS Quincy f iel~ office nor the community properly ut1l1zep the t:~ll-free hotl1n7 number to report allegations of abuse or neglectr Theteamcla.1ms that neither the head of the local Probation Of~ice nor t~e teach\u00ad ers at the local elementary school were aware of the hotl1ne number. -262-, ~ ~ ,~,t ! I r ! The teachers were not aware of their status as mandated reporters and the principal was not aware of the 800 number, either. Both' he and the local .. DPA superintendent preferred to report locally, regardless. Recommendations include educating the general public through an intensified publicity program and that DCFS study the feasibility of call-forwarding local reports to the SCR. 10. Issue ten is that structure and staffing of the DCFS offi.ce have an impact on service delivery and case monitoring. This issue seems obvious, and very little discussion is devoted to it. Recommendations include separating intake functions from case management duties, hiring experienced nurses and investiqa\u00ad tors to assist on cases, and, again, supervisors ma:j..ntaining case\u00ad load information on each worker in the office. 11. The elBventh issue is that \"Follow-up procedures related to client services and case management are not well developed. II The key recommendation regarding this problem is that the DiVi\u00ad Sion of Policy and Plans, with the input and approval of other Department units, develop policy for provision of services to fami\u00ad lies during such transition and adjustment periods as Pamela and the three Madden children 'underwent. The services recommended are to be composed of homemakers, day care, counseling, and par\u00ad ent education. The recollunendation. adds that the service could be developed as a written service plan, with a stipulation that failure by a parent to follow the outlined plan could result in removal of the children from the home. 12. The twelfth and final issue is stated thus: \"The com\u00ad munity reaction to or image of DCFS may have a detrimental effect on the Department's ability to investigate, treat and prevent child abuse and neglect. II The discussion notes the negative reactions by cOTIilTIunity members following Alan Madden's death alid also chas\u00ad tises Quincy DCFS office staft for failing to explain the Depart\u00ad ment 'os functions, purposes, goals, and procedures to the general community. The only recommendation is that the Department attempt to strengthen its image throug!1 education. Presentations to local civic groups are suggested as the primary forum for this educa\u00adtional effort. The DCFS investigative report was prepared very quickly. We have presented what some of the principal figures in the Madden case had to say about the report and the disciplinary action that resulted from it. Undoubtedly, the report's authors realized that such a brief investigation could not identify all of the problems pOinted up by the Madden case, but they appear to have presented those issues that seemed most pressing at the time the investiga\u00adtion was performed. 'Quincy Police Department records, which are voluminous, pro\u00ad vide some very interesting information not reflected in DCFS re\u00ad cords or anywhere else. This information serves two purposes: it provides answers to questions that previously had remained un\u00ad answered~ and it may help to explain some of the events leading up,to Alan Madden's death. . \" -263-a au $44 Berg is Pamela Madden's maiden name. Quincy police officers were able to interview relatives of Pamela (Berg) Madden who cam~ to Quincy for Alan's funeral. They, as well as neighbors ~nd fr~ends of Pamela Madden, told police that Tina had ~een bad~y bru~sed on several occasions when she was still a ch~ld. Fr~ends of Madden told police that they had S~een her force Alan to try to ~o pushups as a punishment when he was only four years old. Two ne~gh~ors mentioned that they had seen him trying to leave home~ push~ng a box with his belongings in it, because of the wa~ h~s mc:>ther treated him. One relative mentioned that Alan ~em~nded h~s mother of her first husband, Gerald Madden, and that d~spleased her. Police also learned that both Crain and Madden were in the. habit of using aliases. All of the water bills a~ ~adden's res~-: \" dence in Quincy were paid by her, uSing the name N~cole St. James. She may have used similar aliases for o~her PUl~'poses as well. The mysterious Dean Fanucchi, Madden's f~anc~ w~th whom the DCFS caseworkers wanted to meet to discuss the ch~ldren, turned out to be James Crain. None of Alan Madden's relatives ~ame forward to take r~sponsi\u00ad bility for his funeral. He was buried in a ~onated c~sket ~n a donated burial plot with police officers act~ng as pallb~arers. Hours after James Crain was released on $300,000 bond, h~s home was firebombed and he left town. Pamela Madden's murder trial was held in Cook ~ount~ because the widespread publicity about Alan Madden's death ~n Qu7ncy could have been prejudicial. On May 8, Pamela Madden was conv~c~ed o~_ involuntary manslaughter. She was sentenced,~!:o ten years ~n pr~ son for the killing of her son, Alan. James Cra in was, tr ied for murder in Spr ir;.gf ie 10 in Ju ly . 1 981, , but the proceedings ended in a.mistrial . Ult~mately, the tr~~: I was held in Adams County Circu~t Court, w~th most of the test~ mony being offered in December, 1981. Pamela Madd~n testified for the prosecution, ~aying tha~ while. she had used some corporal punishment on Alan, Cra~n, q mart~al arts enthusia\"S't:-had used a karate maneuver she called a .\"knee drop': on the bo~. She said this consisted I of Crain,~ s repeat~dly slamming Alan's face down over his knee. lIt was l~ke break~ng a board over his knee,\" she said, according to.a Decemb~r ~6, 1981 Chica article. According to art~~le, Cra~n ~n,turn blame~Madden for beating Alan to d'eath and. cla~med he h~d only hit the boy a couple of times. But .. , accord~ng to the Tr~bune, Madden said Crain told her late the night of the beatin~, \"M~ G~d, I didn't mean to hit him that hard. I didn~t mean to k~ll h~m. Crain had not testified at Madd~n's.t~ial~ invoking his con\u00adstitutional protection against self-~ncr~m~n~t~on, and she had not implicated him in the beatings at her tr~al. She char;.gec;t her story for Crain's trial, however, saying she had had to l~e ~n order to protect herself but that she now felt the truth had to w come out. -264-~ \u00ab . 6 ~ f ~ . .,. , i Ii i ., i ~ ~ I I (\\ On December 15, 1981, James Crain was found guilty of involun\u00adtary manslaughter for the killing of Alan Madden. On January 20, 1982, Crain was sentenced to ten years in pri\u00ad son and $10,000 in fines for his role in the beating death of Alan Madden. Circuit Court Judge Edward Dittmeyer levied the maximum penalty for involuntary manslaughter against Crain, telling the defendant the case was \"the most heinous and brutal\" he had seen in his 35 years in the legal profession. II \\: ~ C~ain pleaded for a five-year sentence, telling the judge tha1?/ f~ve years would be \"plenty to pay for the mistakes I've made.\" Among those mistakes, he said, was being involved with Madden and not know'~~ng what to do to prevent child abuse.. Crain claimed that he had called DCFS to report Madden as an abusive parent. Crain also said: \"I didn't kill him, and I wish it was me instead of him. The reason Alan is dead is because I didn't know what to do. She had me fooled. Pame.la hit that kid with a stick many times. This was just one of those times.\" Immediately after the sen~encing, Crain was rearrested and charged ~.,ith 63 counts ,of theft and public aid fraud. Madden was charged the same day with welfare fraud. It is difficult to categorize the Madden case as typical or atypical. I,n many child abuse cases that result in the death of a child, the parent(s) have (:t prior history of abuse and/or n~g\u00ad lect with a social services agency. It is true that Pamela Ma~den had no formal history of abuse or neglect with DCFS. Instea4, e~ she was receiving child welfare services in order for DCFS to assess her fitness to have her children returned permanently to her care. CPS only became involved following the October 17, 1980 allega-tion of possible abuse of Alan. Police reports suggest that perhaps both Alaneand Tina had ,been physically abused quite a bit more than ever was discovered. The severity .of abuse finally inflicted upon Alan Madden was what made this case appear so heinous. The case also suggests that the child protective system failed miserably in the Madden case. DCFS and the Staters Attorney's Office in Galesburg appear to have experienced breakdowns in their functions, allowing Alan and Tina to be returned to a mo'ther who had Signed irrevocable surrenders on the children. Some of the findings of the DCFS investigative team appear to be correct, while others are questionable. Hopefully, we have presented a balanced view of this case, showing the realities of how the case was handled as opposed to the investigative team's blunt suggestions concern\u00ad ing caseworkers' and supervisors' doing a better job in filing forms and calling the registry. I. ConcluSion - A suudy of 112 cases of child homicide in New York City span\u00ad 'ning a two-year period in the late 1960's, entitled \"The Murdered Child and His Killers,\" by David Kaplun and Robert Reich, assailants, the victims, the status of involve\u00ad ment by both law enforcement and social service systems, and a broad discussion of pertinent issues. We will quote .portions of the article that are directly relevant to child abuse-relater death: Over two-thirds of the assailants in the cases we studied were parents or paramours. The most frequently named assailant was the mother, a finding that agreec_>with results of a study on child abuse. The mother usually acted alone but sometimes acted with her paramour. The biological father was the killer in only !e% of the murders, and minor siblings or other children were almost never implicated. In addition to child maltreatment and marital discord, all but 9.2% of the families we studied showed evidence of other be\u00ad haviors prior to the assault that would be considered socially or psychiatrically deviant. In one-fifth of the cases, the victim or sibling had been placed in an institution or foster home because of parental problems. In five of the nine cases in which the victim himself had been in such care, the killing occurred either in the foster home or during a t.rial discharge to the parents. The article provides information consistent wtih ou~c~se.fin~ings. In addition the article discusses the problem of cont~nu~ng Jeo~\u00ad ardy for other children in the home and th~ interaction of psych~a\u00ad trie, social service, and law enforcement ~nvolvement: After a child has been murdered there are generally surviving siblings or subsequently born children. In 79% of these cases we studied in which the children remaL~ed L~ parental custody following the homicide, there was evidence of possible jeop\u00ad ard~~' and in 32%, continued neglect or abuse was a matter of recdid. The case of Mr. and Mrs. B illustrated such jeopardy. In a similar case no charge was pressed against the father, a violent criminal who used narcotics, after one death because the evidence was deemed insufficient for court purposes. In this case a younger child later died under suspicious circu~\u00ad stances and another sustained a subdural hematoma and mult~ple fractur~s. In the latter instance the hospital physician re\u00ad fused to file a child-abuse complaint although he was aware of earlier injuries because\u00b7che was impressed with the mother's gentle manner and did not know about either her own past epi\u00ad sodes of ungovernable violence or the husband's history. When penal and cor;t:'ectional institution~ were exclude~, .we found that befoie the murders 61% of the publ~c welfar~ fam~l~es were known to social o~ mental health agencies and th~t 47% were known to such agencies afterward. In both.periods, the con\u00ad tact with psychiatric, counseling, and guidance agencies was negligible. Law enforcement activity, as shown by revie\"l of 60 of the pub\u00ad lic welfare cases, was meager and minima-I. In 20 cases, no suspect was arrested. Of 25 cases in which po~tarrest informa- -266-Ii r . r ! .\\ tion was available, 17 suspects went to trial. Virtually all alleged assailants were given short sentences on reduced charges in return for guilty pleas, and one c~se .was dismissed because the witn.f,!ss to the killing was a 10-year-old sibling whose testi\u00ad mony was deemed inadmissable on the groUnd of age. Only in orte case--a highly publicized one in which the father had drowned his child--was there a conviction for first-degree murder. Psychiatric evaluation was used only in the cases of four women who were sent to state hospitals. Part of the diSCUSSion above centers on counseling and psychiatric help offered to assailants and alleged assailants because the authors had a vested interest in considering psychiatric options. But the information also makes it clear that t:he cases ''Ie examined, in wh~ch little counseling was offered or was available, and the sentences in those cases, both follow patterns discovered in this New York study. The authors offer the following in the discus- sion portion of their article; the six questions are intended to identify abusive home situations. The final parag'raph from the article presents an interesting view of the abusive household that is still disputed, though most opinions agree that violence in the home is not confined to one child but is endemic among most or all of the household members: Only rarely are the violence-prone adults associated with these homicides recognized\"by, their community agencies as needing psychiatric attention, and they do not seek such attention on their own. What, then, are the prospects for early identifi\u00ad cation of children in potential jeopardy? Such identification cannot be made with certainty. But bearing in mind that the great majority of the cases came from poverty-saturated areas and that most were known to the pyblic welfare agency, it ,-;ould seem that professionals who serve young mothers wifh out-of\u00ad wedlock children in such areas should identify cases in which some of the following s~ questions have affirmative answers: 1. 2. 3. Does an. adult in the home have a history of assaultiveness toward children or adults, of involvement with crime, drugs or. alcohol-;-or of episodes of impulsive rage? Is there an unwanted pr.egnancy, with a neglected or abused phild already in the home'? Where there is a legal or consensual marriage, is it marked by discord and physical violence? 4. Is casual promiscuity or prostitution the mother's way \" of life? 6. When children are seriously ill or badlY injured, has there been failu~e or-delay in seeking or using avail\u00ad able med~E~';\\l care? Are relationships with neighbors or relatives character~ \" ized by mutual hostility or avoidance? -267-( r r .'< ... i\\ -- () o \\ c ,,\" a as ; $$ \\ Our study throws into question the widely held belief that. the abused child is the family scapegoat, battered by his parents while his siblings are unharmed. We have repeatedly seen the contrary. Our study also does not tend to support the belief that severely abusing parents are receptive to counseling or psychotherapy: the extreme, long-standing psychopathology, the host of coexisting problems, and the paucity of insight and motivation all tend to point against this view for most cases. Cenunissien staff examined an article entitled \"Mest Murders ef Children Caused by Family Abuse\" by Louise S. Miller and Carelyn Rebecca Bleck in a recent issue ef the fempiler, a newsletter pub\u00ad lished by the Illineis Law Enfercement Conunissien. AlIef the data presented are extremely pertinent to. eur investigatien. The authers state that data in the study ceme frem \"pelice-level\" assessments ef child deaths, which they explain as fellews: These data are police-level; that is, they represent the in\u00ad vestigating police officer's assessment of the incident. If the police consider an incident to be a murder, the incident is counted as a murder on the SHR, whether or not the suspect is later cleared of murder in court. Thus, these data do not reflect the number of people convicted of murdering children. Rather, they reflect the number of children that the police consider to be murder victims. While this typelegy can cause seme pJCeblems (the pelice may have been ever-zealeus in certain cases in classifying them as murders), the data are useful and prebably accurate because, as we have seen, so. few peeple are ever cenvicted ef murder ef chil\u00ad dren. Seme are judged insane at the time ef the killing, seme plea-bargain fer a lesser sentence, and seme cases never ceme to. ceurt. The article states that the leading CaUse ef murder ef chil\u00ad dren feur years eld and yeunger in Illineis frem 1976-1980 was abuse by a family member. Of the total ef 151 murders reperted in the article, 62% were murdered by a parent, step-parent, er ether family member. One hundred ef the children were murdered in Chicago.; the remainder were killed in ether parts ef the state. However, the article peints out that the relatienships ef victims to. effenders was censistel):t statewide, as were the Gircumstances surreunding the murders. During the ceurse ef eur investigatien, eur scrutiny ef the natienal media well as ef lecal seurces led us to. semeef the mest extreme cases ef child abuse that ene can imagine.

Gelles, in an article entitled \"Vielence Teward Children in the United States,\" (in Beurne and Newberger's Criti\u00adcal Perspectives en Child Abuse), claims to. present the first study ef parent-te-child vielence based en a true cress-sectien ef Ameri\u00ad can families. He states that his data must be the mest accurate such data cencerning American child abuse yet presented. Regarding child abuse resulting in death, Gelles estimates that anywhere frem 365-700 children are killed each year in this ceuntry as a result ef child abuse. Gelles also. mentiens that the data that he presents indicates that vielence against children almest always represents a pattern ef abuse rather than a series ef iselated events. The enly times that vie lent episedes were ene-time affairs were in the atypical abusive situatiens, such as when a parent uses a knife er a gun en his child. We ebtained other data frem the \"Annual Statistical Repert: Natienal Analysis ef Official Child Neglect and Abuse Reperting, 1978,\" published by the American Humane Asseciatien in cenjunc\u00ad tien with the Denver Research Institute ef the University ef Denver. This repert clesely parallels terms ef the dates ef abuse repert cempilatiens: the report was in Nevember, 1979. This repert presents infermatien abeut 66,248 children who. had been abused in this country. The repert states that 331 ef these children (half ef 1%) died as a result abuse, but adds this caveat: \"ThiS, ef ceurse, dees net include these children who. died after the report was cempleted and therefere must be cen\u00ad ties.\" child death that the Cenunissien re\u00ad viewed, perhaps half ef the children had died at the time the re\u00ad pert was initially prepared.

This is a partial listing ef data available to. these researchers. Therefere, if 331 deaths is censidered censervative, and is based en partial data, the tetal number ef child abuse-related deaths must be far higher. Cleser to. heme, decumentatien given us by the Department ef Children and Family Services fer FY 79 (also. cemparable to. the ether dates being used herein) indicates a tetal ef 57 deaths state\u00ad wide as a result ef child abuse.

Only 14% ef the deaths were reperted by percent ef the chil\u00ad dren who. had been killed had been under the age ef three.

A great deal of attention has been focused recently on incest, partially because it appears tb be much more p,ervasive than anyone thought even a few years ago. Research and self-help groups such as Par\u00ad ents Anony~ous have uncovered cases of sexual assault in a large percentage of our female population, so much so that almost any figures are contradicted by data from more recent studies. The more the phenomenon of family sexual abuse is studied, the more pervasive intrafamilial child sexual abuse is shown to be. It is the hidden crime; the secret assault. Staff research has turned up a tremendous number of defini\u00adtions of incest, ranging from simplistic definitions to more com\u00ad plicated definitions that take into account many factors. For instance, Sandra Butler provides the following definition of in\u00ad cestuous assault in her book Conspiracy of Silence: The Trauma of Incest: \"Any manual, oral or genital sexual contact or other explicit s~xual 'behavior that an adult family member imposes on a child, who is unable to alter or understand the adult's behavior because of his or her powerlessness in the family and early stage of psychological development.\" Researchers agree that incest is a more serious form of sexual abuse than sexual abuse that is non-family related. The after\u00ad effects are more lasting and far-reaching in incestuous situations, primarily because a parental or family bond of trust has been vio-lated. \" \\\\- The Commission report Child Molestation: The Criminal ... Tustice System provides information ccmcerning the effects that such non~ family molestation has on'''' its vict ims. Another CommiSSion report, 'The Sexual Exploitation of Children, deals \\\\1ith child pornography and child prostitut,ion. Readers should refer to those reports in order to deve~op a comp*ete picture of sex crimes against chil\u00ad dren. This chapter will deal specifically with sexual assaults and relationships betw,een children and members of their own fami-lies. . A~ Gail ~ ,~) -----!, G (l Gail walked into the Chicago Ridge~olice Department station on October 23, 1978, and \"reported that her father had sexually molested her. She told 'the police that her father had also sex\u00ad ually molested her sister's,' but, she specifically refused to file charges against her father fqF fear that such an action would ag\u00ad gravate her mother's heart condition. The police quickly contacted ,.allof the girls ,in the family (one out of state and three in the home, includi>ng Gail) to question them regarding theSe allegations. -271-- --------.-..--- ~-~----- -~ .... ------;, ... ! -------------- All of the girls responded that on more than one occasion their father had 'had sexual relations with each of them. None of the girls agreed to file charges against the man. Based on Gail's initial all~gations and confirmation from the other girls, the police took protective custody of all of the girls still in the home and took them to a girlfriend's house un\u00adtil DCFS could take custody. Police also reported the matter to DCFS and questioned the father about the allegations w Soon thereafter, when DCFS became involved with the case, Gail's two sisters returned home at their own request. The two girls were twelve and seventeen at the time; Gail was fifteen. Gail refused to return home and was instead placed in foster care while DCFS referred the case to CAUSES (referred to earlier in this report) for treatment. The DCFS worker we int~fviewed who had handled the case con\u00ad firmed that none of the girls would sign a complaint against their father. The decision to refer Gail to CAUSES was made jointly by a DCFS caseworker and her supervisor. She explained that CAUSES' basic philosophy is that sexual abuse cannot be treated success\u00ad fully unless the family is intact; the primary goal of therapy, she said, is reunification of the victim with other members of the family_ DCFS records of the initial investigation state that the father came to CPS offices to discuss the allegations. The fol\u00ad lowing account comes directly from the case history: Mr. openly admitted having sexually abused all three girls. He stated that Gail was the only one of his daughters whom he had \"penetrated\" and that he had started having sexual intercourse with her when she was 13 years old. He said that he had had sex with Gail on many occasions, most recently, about one week prior to the interview. He stated that he had only \"showed\" Violet sex once during the summer but when she said that lt hurt, he stopped. He said that he had at one time, had a sexual relationship with Carol, but the last incident took place over a year ago and ended due to Carol's insisting that they st9P having relations. Mr. told us that in the beginning with the girls~ he thought that he would be \"teaching them about sex\" but the whole thing got out of hand when he actually penetrated Gail. He said that his wife had severe medical problems and that he had had practically no sexual relationship with his wife for the previous five years. Al} of the inci~ents with his 4aughters had occurred when the wife was hospitalized; she never knew about them until Gail went to the P91ice. The father said that he wanted to receive help and even volun\u00ad teered to move out of the home. He wanted the family to remain -272- '.,i . together.., but if the children had to be placed, he would allow it. A DCFS caseworker first viSited Gail on October 26, 1978. Gail was very open about the incestuous relationship with her father; she told the worker that it had begun when she was twelve. She said that her father bribed her at first by saying that she couldn't see her friends unless she had sex with him. Gail also said that her father had left her alone at times, but resumed the relationship whenever the mother was hospitalized. Gail said that a friend of hers had given her the courage to first talk to a priest and then go to the police. She had am\u00ad bivalent feelings about her father and did not want to get him into trouble, but she also did not want to continue her sexual relationship with him. She still loved him and was afraid that he would have to go to jail. DCFS workers interviewed the mother on October 30, 1978. She expressed guilt about the poor relationship she had with her husband and anger at Gail because she had gone to the pol;.ice. She would have preferred that, Gail had come to her with+;he prob\u00ad lem so that it could have been dealt with within the fi?~o.ily. The mother agreed to counseling and expressed the wish that all three daughters remain in the home with her. She felt she could ade\u00ad quately protect them now that she knew what was going on. DCFS workers also interviewed the ,eldest daughter. The father had left her alone for more than a year after the initial assault, ever since she told him that their sexual relationship upset her. The eldest daughter was very angry with Gail for going to the po\u00ad lice\u00b7 she too was afraid that her mother would die from the added stre~s. The eldest daughter simply could not understand why Gail had gone to the police. The youngest daughter also was angry with her sister for going to the ,authorities. She told DCFS that her father had tried to have sex with her once, but that he stopped when she said that it hurt. The first CAUSES assessment is dated January 25, 1979, and covers the period from initial referral to December 3~, 1979: The report states that the mother ran the household, w'~th an ~ron hand in spite of her \"illness. The mother ,was viewed as being com\u00ad pletely dominant. Gail is described as follows: \"She seems con-' sistently to be on the 'bottom of the hierarchy' at home, although she is descJ;ibed by everyone in the family as 'daddy's girl. III The family had described itselt' as being happy, but CAUSES worke~ felt that there was a good deal: of hostility within the family: The report states that the parents engaged in \"one-up\u00ad manship\" and that the mother \"set the ,children up\" by pitting them l against ,one another. The report states that the first objective was to.get Gail to return to the home, but it also notes that she -273-:. - was very resistant to returning, partially because of her father and partially because of the reactions of her sisters. The fol\u00ad lowing comes directly from the CAUSES report: During the course of the interviews with the father, he stead\u00ad fastly stated that he had had sex with his daughters and he knew that it was wrong, but that he was trying to \"instruct\" them as to what to do when confronted by the sexual demands of their peers; i.e., how to kick, bite and scratch when con\u00ad fronted by a man. He was unable to admit to his untenable pos:ition of \"instructing them in the art of defense against sex\" while not allow~g them to fight him back. The report acknowledges that although the family had been resis\u00ad tant to counseling, the potential for change \"still seems moderately good.\" CAUSES also submitted a, repOl:'t sometime in 1979 (an undated report) that contains a sumrpary of progress to date on Gail and her family. The summary stfltes that the very day Gail was returned to the home (February 2, 19//79), she reported to the police that she was molested again by ~er father. The police again assumed temporary cust,ody, and the father left the home. We were told that the two workers involved with the case from CAUSES were Clifford Rot and Debra Sachs. After several counsel\u00ad ing sessions with them, Gail was returned home. When the second sexual assault allegation surfaced, CAUSES staff requested per\u00ad mission to remain active on the case, but the request was denied by the DCFS liaison with CAUSES. The case was taken to court. The DCFS caseworker told us that the contract between DCFS and CAUSES for work on Gail's case was officially terminated upon en\u00adtry of the case to the court system. The court ordered the ,father to leave the home and gave DCFS custody of Gail. Although the father was not charged with a cri\u00ad minal offense, a protective order was issued to assure his stay\u00ad ing out of the home. Gail was then placed in temporary foster care. The caseworker told us that when she interviewed members of the family, Gail's mother and sisters were very upset with Gail because she had reported her father's activities to the police. No one wanted to discuss the incest, and they blamed Gail for forc\u00ad ing the father out of the home and out of a position to provide \"for them. The two other daughters told the c,aseworker that they forgave their father for what he had done. The caseworker dis\u00ad cerned a feeling of competition between the mother and Gail as a possible source of her extreme irritation with Gail. The caseworker told us that counseling was provided by the Special Services Section of the Cook County Probation Department after CAUSES' involvement in the case was terminated. Counselors from the Department worked with the family twice a month and more intensively with Gail alone. -274-I 1 I The next document we reviewed is a social investigation done by DCFS. It\u00b7refers to the February 2, 1979 allegation. After, the police assumed temporary custody, Gail was ~laced at ,New L1fe House in Chicago. The DCFS report states, \"Dur1ng the f1rst wee~\u00ad end of Gail's placfement, she seemed to feel rather self-destruct1ve-\u00ad as witnessed by the fact that in the space of two days she managed to smash her fist into a brick wall, hav~ her foot ru~ over ~y a car and fall down the stairs of New L1fe House dur1ng a f1re drill: All of these incidents required medical attention.\" DCFS report'ed that a worker visited the mother when she. was home alone on April 4, 1979. The first thing the mot~er tol~ the worker was that she never had believed Gail's allegat10n aga1nst her husband. \"'When asked why Gail would falsely accuse her fa~her of sexually abusing her, said that Gail was a chron1c liar, who was angry at her parents for forbidding her to see ~ boy of whom they did not approve.\" The mother also character1zed Gail as \"the bad seed\" who had always been in trouble. On this same date, the same worker visited Gail. Gail told her that she was very confused about her father--that she both loved and hated him. She was angry at her sisters and mother and expressed no wish to see any of them. The DCFS worker's impression was that it seemed very unlikely that the family ever could be reunited. As a result, long-term foster care was seen as the most viable plan for Gail. COmITlission investigators also interviewed a probat~on offi\u00ad cer with, the Special Services Unit ?f Cook C?unty J~ven11e Court in order to gain a greater perspect1ve on th1s part1cular case and to determine just how the special unit functions. She told us that, the Special Services Unit cons,ists, of, six social workers and one supervisor. The purpose of the un1t 1S to serve sexually abused children, the majority of whom are female. We were told that creation of the unit was the idea of Assistant State's At\u00ad torneys Mary Martin and Catherine Ryan, who had both ,noted ~ lack of adequate care for these children by DCFS. The un1t prov1des individual, family, and other group counseling therapy. We were also told that the unit can work on a case only upon court order; whe;n a service plan is developed., the unit worker attempts to have th(~ DCFS caseworker actively involved in c~se planning. She added that some workers cooperate with the project and others show no interest in it. We were told that one big problem with the unit's functioning was that the parent/defendant was not compelled by any legal means Gto cooperate with counseling. She said that ,in most cases a par\u00ad ent's attorney wil] advise him to go along w1th counseling because, if nothing else, it will look good to the judge when the case comes before the court againo She said that, in her own experience, these parents attend t~e counselihg sessi?ns but refuse to get involved She also sa1d that she would l1ke to see some leverage exerted ;n parents to either participate or face criminal prose\u00ad cution. -275-Pi; 4 ; 014 away soon this that she his Sometime in the early morning of August 13, 1979, Gail ran from her foster home. The foster parents -notified DCFS as as they discovered that Gail ~as missing. A few hours after notification, Clifford Rot of CAUSES called DCFS to report Gail was in his office. Apparently, she had called Rot ~.,hen ran away .and he met her at 3:00 a.m. Rot then took Gail to office where he allegedly fell asleep and Gail sat up all night. The DCFS worker asked Rot to the foster home, but she refused. home had precipitated her running cess of seeking another placement to that pOint. t~y and get Gail to return to Gail's problems at the foster away and DCFS was in the pro\u00ad but had been unsuccessful up Rot demanded that Gail be hospitalized immediately, based on the recommendation of Dr. Greenberg. The DCFS worker indicated that the guardianship administrator would not agree to this es\u00ad pecially since CAUSES staff were no longer responsible for ~lan\u00ad ning on Gail's case. Rot reportedly berated the worker for her lack of professionalism and said that Gail should \u00b7be picked up at the CAUSES office, although he would not \"guarantee ll that she would be there. Eventually, Rot dropped Gail off at CPS offices. The CPS workers decided at that point to take her to the Institute for Applied Behavioral and Psychological Research for testing and treat\u00adment. The probation officer and the DCFS caseworker agreed that R~t's continued involvement in the case had Undermined DCFS plan\u00ad nlng and the caseworker's relationship with Gail. The probation office~ added that Rot need not have encouraged \"her dependence upon hlmn; ~urther, ~he noted that Rot failed to notify all of theapproprlate partles when he first learned of Gail's runaway: DCFS, the police, and the foster parents. On October 19, 1979, ,Gail was again placed in temporary fos\u00adter care. During this placement, her delinquent and other inap\u00ad p:opr~ate behavior appeared to escalate. Allegedly, she set a flre ln a bathroom of a local high school, accused her foster par\u00ad ents of beating her, and hit a policeman following yet anothe~ runaway incident. Because of these incidents Gail was placed . , ln a JSPA group home, the Essex House, in January, 1.980. An agree\u00ad ment was made that Dr. Jonathan Lewis, a psychiatrist at the Insti\u00ad tute, would continue to see Ga,;i..l while she stayed at the Essex House. Unfortunately, problems continued in spite of coordination of efforts by all parties. Essex House staff developed what they defined as a \"very clear pattern of behavior\" that involved Gail's ~anipulation of both people and her environment. Gail 'charged l~ February, 1980, that she had been sexually harrassed by another glrl at Essex. When she discussed the incident with Dr. Lewis the situation appeared to have been resolved. But when she di~\u00ad cussed the incident with another doctor, whom she was visiting -276-.--*W\" ,.\" . r J for a routine physical examination, she became hysterica.l and con\u00ad vinced him that she had indeed been assaulted. The doctor decided that she should be admitted to a hospital for observation and that the other girl should be charged. The director of Essex House confronted the doctor and Gail and tried to persuade him that there was no truth to Gail's allegations. Gail's response was to call the police. The police found no substance to Gail's allegations and re\u00ad fused to recommend removal of either girl from the Essex House facility. Gail's response was to run from the home and stay out all night. Case records indicate a series of problems with Gail there\u00adafter, including attempts to persuade Dr. Lewis to allow her to stay out all night, two unauthorized and unannounced visits with Clifford Rot, and extreme emotional reactions to simple occurrences. On March 30, 1980, Gail was granted a pass to go to the movies alone. At 9:30 that night, she called in and asked what would happen if she came home late. She was told that she had to be home by 10:30 that night. She did not show up. She appeared at Dr. Lewis' office a~ 8:30 the next morning, exactly on time for an appointment. She told him an incredible story of having been kidnapped and raped by four men the night before; she claimed that she escaped just in time to get to his office for her apPointment. A sumni.ary from the Essex House records states, lilt should be noted that Gail later admitted she lied about being abducted and raped. II The next incident of note was referred to in interviews that we conducted and in files that we reviewed. In essence, Gail ran away again on the evening of April 1 and called her boyfriend to pick her up at a bar. An hour later, he picked her up and they drove to one of Gail's former foster placements. An hour later, they drove to the boyfriend's house, picked up some money and food, and Gail called Clifford Rot to tell him she was coming over to his apartment. They arrived about midnight; the boyfriend dropped her off. The next morning, the boyfriend called at about 8:00 a.m. to speak with Gail and was told by Rot that Gail was still asleep. When he called again an hour later, he got the same re\u00ad sponse. Sometime later that day, Rot brought Gail to Dr. Lewis' office. Dr. Lewis called the DCFS caseworker. The caseworker spoke with Rot and asked why he had not noti\u00ad fiedDCFS when Gail appeared at his apartment. He refused to an\u00ad swer her questions. A portion of the caseworker's memorandum re\u00ad porting this inCident follows: When Gail was placed at Essex House Mr. Rot and I discussed, at le~gth, Gail's running to him. We agreed that he would fol\u00ad low proper procedure by notifying one of the following, pre\u00ad ferably in this,. order: 1. DCFS 2. Police 3. Essex House or ~ of a number of persons in this girl's life, at this point, is giving her double messages. She is placed in a structured setting at Essex House. On the other hand she is taken in by a previous worker with whom she has had a prior relationship. This worker's failure to return her to place\u00ad ment gives tacit approval to her for running away. What I want is clarification regarding Gail's case; clear messaqes around what should occur if she runs in the future. After discussion of this issue with her superiors, the caseworker initiated the filing of a supplemental petition in Juvenile Court with respect to the actions of Clifford Rot. A protective order agreed to by JSPA's director, Rot, a DCFS attorney, an assistant state's attorney, and a guardian ad litem was signed by Judge Arthur N. Hamilton on May 14, 1980. Each of the five paragraphs in the order mentions Rot and enjoins him from acting toward Gai.l as he had in the past. The last we heard from the caseworker was that she no longer was monitoring Gail's case. As far as she knew, Gail still was in placement and the father had returned to the home. She said that the extent of his counseling was to speak with a priest twice a month. iJ j The last that we know about Gail comes from a letter from a JSPA social worker td DCFS officials. The letter, dated July 21, 1980, confirms Gail' s dis!.:.~harge from JSPA. It mentions that Gail had runaway from Essex House on June 23, 1980. Though JSPA workers had made an attempt to locate her, Gail's last contact had occurred when she called Dr. Lewis from a phone booth on the city's south side three weeks before the letter was drafted. The letter mentions that Gail had been seen prostituting herself on the city's north side during the week aft~r her runaway, but she had not been seen since. The social worker notes that Gail had never been away for more than 24 hours before this incident. He refers to her continued psychiatric care for more than a year and her extreme emotional outbursts and concludes that JSPA staff was very concerned about her ability to stay out for so long unharmed. Apparently, that was the last contact that Gail had with the Usystem. \" Conunission investigators spoke with Dr. Lewis about iGail; he told us that he could not discuss her case because of doctor\u00ad patient privilege. But he did agtee to discuss the role that psy\u00ad chiatrists playas consultants for DCFS. Dr. Lewis told us that he had been under contract to DCF$ for seven years, wprking part\u00ad time (20 hours per week). He assessed clients and counseled wards for DCFS. These functions were intended to assist in placement planning. Dr. Lewis added that he was engaged in his own research into the typology and characteristics of child abuse. -278-Dr. Lewis conunented on what he called \"myths\" perpetuated by DCFS officials through their bureaucracy. The first such myth is that DCFS assumes that children referred to DCFS are \"normal\" and can be handled even by untrained workers. He mentioned that one of the Department's deputy directors had told him that 90% of the Department's wards are normal, while 10% are disturbed. Dr. Lewis felt that these percentages really should be reversed. He said that by the time he sees children, they have been abused, severely neglected, or orphaned, and then brought into the bureau\u00ad cratic system of the courts and DCFS. Most of the children he sees are severely disturbed. The second myth Dr. Lewis challenged is the DCFS assumption that because there is a natural bond between child and parent, placement with the natural parent is best. Dr. Lewis strongly opposed the trend to keep the family together in cases of extreme abuse. He felt that at the time that abuse occurs, parents are actually mentally ill. \"Impulsive abusers\" should develop the necessary controls to stop their behavior before it becomes dan\u00ad gerous. Other abusers, primarily the sadists he has encountered in his practice, have \"personality deficits\" that prevent them from feeling guilt. Dr. Lewis concluded by saying that abused children should not be considered mentally healthy. He has encountered a major\u00ad ity of children who feel extremely guilty as a result of their abuse; some feel that they are \"evil\" and somehow caused the abuse through their own behavior. These children both love and hate their parents and need treatment to sort out their emotions, as in Gail's case. Gail's \u00b7case was complicated because of the personality traits involved, the home situation, the involvement of other girls in the home in sexual abuse, and Gail's multiple placements. Compli\u00ad cating the abuse were the double messages that Gail received from professionals assigned to her case. The ultimate effectiveness of any of the treatment and therapy offered to Gail remains unknown. Our final contact with the Chicago Ridge Police Department revealed that Gail's family had moved out of state, probably to Texas or Kentucky. Nothing further has been heard of Gail. B. On June 20, 1980, Mary, a four-year-old child, was taken to Forkosh Memorial Hospital by her mother and grandmother, following complaints of internal pains. After they arrived at the hospital, the mother told hospital personnel that Mary had said she had been sexually molested by her father. Hospital staff then called both DCFS and the police. Upon examination\" doctors could detect no \"penetration or trauma. II However, the doctor added this observation, as recorded in DCFS case notes: \"Because of the age of the child he feels that she is being sexually abused because she is not old enough -279-to make up the story and because of her persistence. II Also, the mother reported that for the previous two months, her husband had been going into Mary's bedroom at night. The following mornings, Mary had trouble urinating. The mother told the police she had con'fronted her husband but he denied it every time. The mother refused to sign a com\u00ad plaint against her husband because, as she told a DCFS worker, she \"did not know what would become of her\" if she were to do so. A Chicago Police Department investigator spoke with the CPS worker assigned to the case, Michael Frank. The police report states that Frank had interviewed the victim and that \" he felt this family was in need of professional counseling through the Courts, and that his agency was pursuing the case via the Family Court.\" As a result, he requested that the case be close~ by the police, and it was. On June 30, 1980, Mary's mother took her to Children's Memorial Hospital because of her daughter's complaints that the father had been fondling her. DCFS case notes state that the mother had no\u00ad ticed spots of blood on Mary's underwear. An emergency room doc\u00ad tor confirmed that the spots were indeed blood; his examination showed redness and irritation to the vaginal area but no penetra\u00ad tion. Again the police were called; again the mother refused to sign a complaint; again the police closed the case. On July 7, 1980, Mary's mother took her to Swedish Covenant Hospital, alleging that her husband had sexually molested Mary. The medical examination by two doctors discovered an \"old\" tear of the hymen. One of the doctors quoted Mary as saying that her father \"put his finger in her lower part. II This time the mother told doctors that the molestation had been going on for 2~ years. DCFS case notes emphasize the doctors found no new injury and that they did not recommend hospitalization. Again the police were called; this time they took Mary and her mother to the station for further interviews. All parties involved were concerned about the case because of obvious mental limitations of the mother. Nonetheless, the police arrested the father and charged him with taking indecent liberties with a child. The assistant state's attorney called in to interview family mem\u00ad bers determined that both parents were so limited intellectually that nei\"ther would be credible as a witness in court. In fact, he felt the only credible witness would be the girl, Mary, who was far too young to qualify as a witness. As a result, the charges against the father were dismissed. DCFS case notes state that Mary \\I~as considered to be at \"high risk\" and that protective cus\u00ad tody should be taken as soon as possible. The next day, after a review of the case by the Child Abuse Unit of the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, police took custody of Mary and this time arrested both parents. Mary was placed in temporary custody of OCFS and taken to emergency foster -280- '. ,\\J \" care. The parents were bailed out of jail and, four days later, the mother was admitted to Read Mental Health Center following a disturbance in the alley behind her home. This case becomes clearer when we examine a report submitted by CAUSES on July 29, 1980, entitled \"CAUSES Diagnostic Assess\u00ad ment/Closing.\" As it turns out, Michael Frank had no intention at the beginning of the case of referring Mary's case to Juvenile Court. Contrary to what he told the police, he referred the family to CAUSES for treatment, thereby limiting the likelihood of court involvement, since CAUSES generally will not work on cases that have been referred to the court. Frank took the entire family to CAUSES offices for counseling on the first day Mary was released, June 24. The report we examined covers the period from June 24 to July 29, 1980. The report states that the parents were seen in CAUSES offices on the 24th, the 26th, and on July 1. The report adds, \"~~~~ __ took Mary on 7-2-80 to a private physician and then to Children's Memorial Hospital with vaginal bleeding which Mary stated occurred by mother scratching her with her fingernail while applying a vaginal cream.\" The parents were seen in CAUSES offices again on July 2, and July 8, prior to their arrest. The father also had a visit in CAUSES offices with Mary, supervised by Michael Frank, on July 18. The report concludes: Mrs. has a long history of mental illness and hos- pitalization and presents as a paranoid schizophrenic. Mr. I who is 14 years her junior, presents as a deeply -~-n-x-i-o-u-s-an--d depressed man whose apparent inadequate personal\u00ad ity is overwhelmed by his wife's illness and his inability to deal with her actions and accusations. Mary, in her two visits with the child therapist shows evidence of emotional disturbance. It was not possible to establish whether loir. has sexually abused his child. Her mother's actions, attention to Mary's genitalia and the fre\u00ad quent examinations of them a.re clearly adding to whatever sex\u00ad ual abuse may have occurred. It may also be \u00b7that Mary has been caught up in her mother's delusional system Court involvement has precluded further CAUSES' intervention and this case is being submitted for closing by this agency unless further services are requested. Mary was reported doing well in her foster home. She asked social workers when she could go home but did not ask anything about her parents. The DCFS social investigation makes it clear that the husband is the sole source of support for his wife; ~ichael Frank indi\u00ad cated she \"may\" qualify tor general assistance or disability if she divorces he~ husband but that she cannot support herself \"un\u00ad less she receives tra.ining. II If the wife understood her dilemma, it may explain why she refused to sign\u00b7 a criminal complaint agains\"t -281-a as , , . . ' $\u00a5 3 her husband and why she said she would not know what to do if she had to live without him. A crucial section of the social investigation is the \"assess\u00ad ment of problem\" section, which follows: The major problem in Mary's case is determining how traumatized Mary was by the sexual abuse by her father and by the manual penetration of her by her mother. Because of the emotional instability of both parents, determining how frequently the child was abused is impossible. Are the parents capable of providing appropriate care for their daughter if they are in '. therapy? The history of the parents' marital relationship and their individual emotionai make-up raises serious doubts about their competency as parents. This assessment also indicates that the motherWs instability and the unlikely prospect that she can make significant strides toward learning how to paren~, Mary properly. The father is assessed as impaired, but the final evaluation is reserved until a more com\u00ad plete study can be done. Frank indicates that'he will attempt to place Mary with a relative until the father I s condi.tion can be assessed. An August 21, 1980 memorandum from a Chicago Police Depart\u00ad ment youth officer assigned to the Abuse/Neglect Unit to the Com\u00ad mander of the Youth Division deals specifically with Mary's case. This particular officer was assigned as liaison to Juvenile Court. The memo reports that aft~r DCFS assumed protective custody of Mary on July 7, Michael Frank again returned Mary to her home, just as he had done in June. The youth officer brought his ac\u00ad tion to the attention of Assistant State's Attorney Catherine Ryan~ who ordered a petition to be filed on Mary. Ryan also approved a warrant for Mary\" s father's arrest on the charge of contr ibut\u00ad ing to the sexual delinquency of a qhild. What happened next, as detailed below from the youth officer's memorandum, is very important to an understandi~g of how Frank handled this case: Assistant state's Attorney Catherllle Ryan informed .DCFS on e July 80 that her office ~'las filing on Mary. Michael Franks [sic), the DCFS caseworker, came into her office onS August BO.R/o was asked by Catherine Ryan to participate in the in\u00ad terview. Michael Franks requested that Catherine Ryan not file on the child. He stated that he was actively involved with the family and court action would interfere in his relation\u00ad ship. He related that he was also aware of two prior reports of sexual abuse which were reported to the Chicago Pol~ce De\u00ad partment (20 June BO and 30 June eO). He further stated he also believes the mother, , is also sexually abusing Mary. He was asked to clarify this statement. Michael Fra~ks stated he was at CAUSES, Illinois Masonic MedicaL Center, when the mother demonstrated how. she applies her [own] medicated' cream to the chil~'s vaginal area. He interpreted her actions to convey sexual overtones. Mother is under psychiatric treat\u00ad ment and exhibits unusual behavior whEm she does not take her Ii i{j i~ \\\\ -282-medication. She has been known not to take her medication- . , M~chael Franks was aware of this. When he was informed that warrants would be sought both on the father (Contributing to the Sex~al Del~nquency) and the mother (Neglect), he became quite upset. At this time he stated that he never had any in\u00ad tentions of bringing this matter to Juvenile Court for 'either criminal or civil charges,,\\ He stated he was working with the family and had them in coUnseling with CAUSES a private agency that DCFS contracts with. Its Executive Director is Dr. Nahman Greenberg, M.D. CAUSES will only work with an intact family. Michael Franks knew if the child was removed from the parents, DCFS could no longer contract the services of CAUSES When he was asked what protection was being provided for ~he childt he could not answer. He then admitted that he had gone to the police station on 7 July 80, took the child and waited until the father was released. At this time, he returned the child to the home. On September 2, 1980, Michael Frank transferred Mary's case to the North Area Office. We should note that the DCFS social inves~igation states erroneously that DCFS \"filed d petition in Juven~le Court on July 8, 1980.\" In fact, Michael Frank took cus\u00ad tody of Mary on July 7 and then returned Mary to he,r home. The State's Attorney's Office, Hot DCFS, filed a petition in Juvenile Court. Commission investigators conducted interviews to determine how this case had been handled by different parties and to give us insight where documents failed to provide it~ We spoke with a Forkosh Memorial Hospital nurse and her super\u00ad visor. The. nurse had been in charge Of the floor when Mary 'was prought ,.in on June 20, \"1980. Perhaps because cases of child abuse are extremely uncommon at Forkosh, the nurse remembered the case ,extremely well. Hospital staff had arranged a room to allow Mary's mother to stay with her, but the mother refused. \"This particular nurse had been on duty when Mary was admitted and again when Michael Frank first qame to the hospital.' Her biggest problem with Frank was his decision that Mary should go home, made after interview- ing her mother over the phone. She protested to him that Mary shoUld not go home because of the nature of the charges against o the father and because of the mother's unstable condition. Frank responded that the parents had agreed to attend counseling seSsions at CAUSES and that unless the parents did not show up for counsel\u00ad , ing, Mary was going home. We also spoke with three Chicago Police Department detectives who had been involved with Mary's case. One of the first officers involved recalled Frank's telling him the case would be referred to court. As a re$ult, the officer requested that the case be cleared by the Chicago Police Department. The same officer also spoke with Dr. Greenberg of CAUSES. GreeJ)berg had assured him that CAUSES was handling the case in cooperation with both DCFS and' Juvenile Court, even tho\\lgh no court re~erral had investigators also spoke ~vith Assistant State's Attorx:-ey Edward stern assigned to Felony Review when Mary was brought l.n on July 7 with her third abuse allegation in three weeks 'He told us that there was very little physical evidence to support the child's claims. The mother did appear to him to be mentally un\u00ad stable. He added that she could not have testified: she could not even tell him her name or address (DCFS case notes reflect that she could not remember her own telephone number and that she carried her address written on a slip of paper for reference). stern was under the impression, though, that Mary wo~ld be removed from her home even though he could not approve charges against the father. He spoke with DCFS workers ~n th~ phone who assured him that a caseworker would be sent out ~mmedl.ately. He recalled telling the workers of his concern for Mary because of the mother's unstable condition. Stern also told us that DCFS said that Mary would be removed from the home. Stern had to re\u00ad spond to another case, so he left the station before ~rank ~howed up. He concluded by telling us that he had been decel.ved or at least misled by DCFS when told that Mary would be removed from the home. He said that had he known she was to be returned home, he. would have done something to prevent it~ We interviewed Michael Frank in our offices 1980. At the time of the interview, Frank was on leave\" with DCFS, working on an advanced degree. work part-time as a therapist for CAUSES. on December 10, \"educational He had gone to Frank told us that CAUSES is the primary agency to handle sexual abuse cases in Cook County_ Frank said that he referred Mary's case to CAUSES because CAUSES 'was the sole provider of ser\u00ad vices. He was not aware of other agencies in Cook County that could handle incest cases. Frank\"also mentioned that a team from CAUSES meets each week at the CPS central offices and reviews copies of reported cases th~t had been referred to CPS during the previous week. Frank added that CAUS~S had t~e only DCF~contract giving clear and immediat;e access l.nformatl.on ~t ~he .l.ntake stage. Through a process o\u00b7f discussion and negotl.atl.on, CAUSES and DCFS workers determine which cases to refer to CAUSES and what type of treatment ,is appropriate. f! . Frank said that he and a supervisor agreed that CAUSES could provj,de immediate service for Mary and .. her family, so\u00b7\u00b7 no court referral was made. Frank told us that proper procedure would be for a CPS worker to monitor a case for a certain period of time and then to transfer it to another unit wit~in CPS responsible for contracts \\,~nd grants liaison. Frank did not ever, transfer this ceise as required. He said that because DCFS pol.l.CY has-changed so often over the years regarding how long the original CPS worker is to monitor a case, he decided to monitor Mary's case himsli=lf, '\" even' after it was referred to a contractual agency, CAUSES. Frank claimed to have made the decision to keep Mary in her home 'because of the close relationship Mary had with her parents, the' abuse allegations notwithstanding. He added .that CAUSES was -284-II to do a family assessment and would be seeing the family regularly as a,whole. Frank a~so planned to attend many of the counseling seSSl.ons at CAUSES h.l.mself. He did not feel any responsibility to reI?ort Mary'~ case to the State's Attorney's Office because any tl.m~ there .l.S a second report of abuse the State's Attorney automat.l.cally is notified. ' Frank said that he was surprised at the third allegation of abuse. As soon as he heard about it he planned to take the father to see Dr. Greenberg directly from j~il. Had they the opportunity to analyze the case, he and Dr. Greenberg might have decided to take the~cas~ to court, he said; they never had that chance be\u00ad cause Ca ... her.l.ne Ryan brought the case to court on her own. then same said ment Frank took t~e fath~r home from jail as he ha? planned, and took the ent.l.re fam:ly to CAUSES the folJq~;kr/g day. That day Ryan summoned hl.m to court to diGd..l35c'the case. Frank that the people at the court were all alarmed at his treat\u00ad plan, and that they should not have been. Frank,criti~ized the State's Attorney's Office for having too mu~h dl.scret.l.on concerning when to file a petition on a child and, br.l.ng the parents to court. He cla~med that the Office never c~ntactsor discusses cases with caseworkers before filing peti\u00ad t.l.ons. He added that it was \"inappropriatell for an assistant ~tate~s attorney to initiate court action without first consult\u00ad .l.ng hl.m. Frank said that it was his responsibility to decide w~en 0,' case should 1:;>e referred to Juvenile Court; certain agen\u00ad Cl.es may sugg~st,that a child is in danger or needs protective, custody, but l.t .l.S solely a caseworker's decision as to when to take cust?dy, even if the matter is a police-reported incident. F:ank adm.l.tted that there is a screening committee to which po\u00ad l:?e, prosecutors, and caseworkers can go with cases. The com\u00ad ml.'Ctee mee'ts regularly and cases could be screened there. He still felt, though, that the decision to refer a child to the court should be in the DCFS caseworker's exclusive domain. ~s a final ,comment on his handling of Ma~y's case, Frank said that l.f he had .l.t to do over again, he might have considered the IImental health conditions\" of the family differently and there\u00ad fore might have decided to remove Mary from the home. , One of the ,larg;,er issues raised by this case is the role of d:fferent ag~nc.l.esand departments. How social workers interact ~l.th the l?o~.l.ce and,representatives of the court can be crucial ~~ determ.l.n.l.ng a ch.l.ld's fate. Frank's attitude that he was the expert who should make all ultimate decisions in Mary's case pre\u00ad vented the victim f.rom being protected and treated for sexual abuse~ even though CAUSES' diagnostiSJ examinations done when she ~as f.l.rst r~ferred showed that she had been scarred emotionally .l.f not phys.l.cally. ' , We spo~e with Catherine Ryan concerning both Mary' $ case and the procedure for referrals coming to the State's Attorney's at\u00ad tention. .' )1 I' {i ;: abandoned children and other \"non-serious\" cases; DCFS keeps most serious abuse and incest cases, refusing to cooperate with her office; and DCFS routinely<ignores its own internal rule. Ryan sa\"id that workers know that nothing will happpen if they circumvent the system and return a child home after the police or another agency has taken protective custody. She added that most DCFS workers appear to feel that they help the victim by not calling the police and by not cooperating with a case when it reaches court. Ryan said that the relationship between her office and DCFS is poor. She added that DCFS workers are ill-trained and ill\u00ad equipped to do the jobs expected of them. Because of a lack of accountability within DCFS, caseworkers felt that they could handle cases in any manner they wished, with no uniformity of approach. Ryan felt that it was incorrect for a DCFS caseworker to be the sole judge of how to handle a case of abuse or incest. All of .her comments were congruent with what we discovered from review\u00ad ing the details of Mary's case. Most incest cases are complicated because of unique factors involved; this case was no exception. Still, except for Frank's attitude toward placement of the victim and treatment for the fam\u00ad ily, the case was handled in a straight-forward fashion. The case does point out, however, how a single worker can interfere with or thwart the purpose of the child protective network that often involves many people. Only when they achieve cooperation will cases be handled with a degree of' uniformity that may be necessary for these cases to be resolved properly., C. Lois and Marcia One of the more bungled cases that the Commission came acrdss during its investigation was the case of Lois and Marcia, twin sisters. At this writing, in September, 1982, the case still has not been fully resolved. Some of the more obvious facets of it remain at loose ends and only now are being addressed appropriately by the authorities. A review of DCFS records reveals that the first contact these girls' family, had with DCFS occurred in 1975, when DCFS received a report that the children had been left with a 16-year-old baby\u00ad sitter in a filthy house while the mpther visited France, her native country., The children were placed in foster care until the mother returned home. In June of 1978, Lois allegedly had been forced to attempt to engage in sexual intercourse w,ith her stepfather. Her ,mother worked at night and was worrj ed about Loas becau_se she had been sick. She' told her daug,hter to sleep with the step'father. When the stepfather told her to remove her clothes and'a-ctempted inter\u00ad course, she told him that it \"wasn',:t right\" and to stop, which he did. -286-\\ , i I r LoiS was afraid to tell the mother about the incident, she later admitted to police, so the following night the mother again advised her to sleep with the stepfather sc that her fever would not worsen and go unnoticed. The stepfather repeated the scene of the previous night and again failed to achieve penetration. Lois asked him to stop again, which he did. Lois did not tell her mother or go to the police. Between July 21 and 25, 1978, Lois was approached by the step\u00ad father while she was making his bed. Again he told her to remove her clothes and attempted to have sexual intercourse with her. Again she told him to stop; this time he did, but he forced her to masturbate him. Then he said \"it was allover\" and told her to go back to her own room to go to bed. A week later, he called her into his bedroom and told her to get into bed with him. He attempted intercou~se ag~in and failed. Again he persuaded Lois to masturbate h~m. F~nally, he tried to coax her to put her mouth on his peniS, saying that her mother did it all the time. She refused. These incidents became known to the police when one of Lois' cousins implicated her in acts of sexual intercourse and oral copu\u00ad lation. The cousin said that LoiS told him she had learned about oral copulation from her stepfather. The police brought Lois to the station, where the incidents described above were reported. The police asked her why she never had reported the abuse. She responded that she felt no one would believe her. , The police asked her if she ever attempted to have oral in\u00ad tercourse with her cousin. She admitted t.hat they had removed some of their clothing and had,k1ssed and rubbed their bodies a'gainst one another, but she ins isted she had never had oral in\u00ad tercourse with him. Marcia also was called in by the police and questioned separ\u00ad ately. She was asked whether her stepfather ever had a~proached her sexually. After heSitating, she offered the follow~ng account. Sometime in April of 1978, she had been asleep in her bedroom af\u00ad ter her mother had left for work. The stepfather woke her and told her to come into his room. She refused and tried to go back to sleep. The stepfather then picked her up and carried her into his bedroom. He forced her to remove her clothes and then lay down on top of her. She told him to stop, which he finally did, and he allowed her to return to her own room. Between July 21 and July 25, 1978, the stepfather called Marcia t1) his bedroomo He told her to remove her clothes. This time he attempted intercourse but did not ,succeed. Marcia told police that he ha~ not t~ied to bother her since but ~hat ~e ha~ shown signs of hostility, not allowing her to spend t~me w~th her friend? and making sure she always was in before curfew. When asl~ed about these inc idents, she told police that she had told no one, not even her ~other, because she felt ashamed and thought that she would not be believed. \" l !' ---------.--....-------_.- ~~-~----------~~ The Bensenville Police Department investigation uncovered the 1975 situation, in which the mother was adjudicated neglect\u00ad ful and placed on two years' probation. The abuse/neglect report had not been easy to find because it had been filed under the mother's previous married name. After the police heard the two girls' stories, they went to their house to remove the remaining son and daughter from the home. At that moment, the mother returned home. Police told her to meet them at the station. All of the chilq;r-en were segregated in the custody of their grandmother t<Jhile officers spoke with the mother. She was shocked at the stories and asked to call her husband. Police allowed her to do so, but cautioned her to only tell him where she was and not to say anything about the allegations. Because the father had been born and raised in France, he spoke very poor English. Police arranged for an officer who was bilingual to interview him. An assistant state's attorney was present for the interview. When the man was asked if either of his stepdaughters ever had sexual contact with him, he replied that they had done so while in France several years ago, but not since that time. He was told of the allegations, all of which he denied. The police notified a DCFS worker and advised her of charges (two counts of contributing to the' sexual delinquency of a child) that had been filed. They also told her that the father could provide bond and be back in the home immediately. As a result, the caseworker decided to place the children in the custody of ,the grandmother. Following placement, DCFS referred the family to CAUSES for treatment. Charges against the stepfather were later dismissed I because DCFS failed to provide records for the court. CAUSES ter...i! minated treatment with the family on September 9, 1979, without notifying the local police, who had made the referral in the first place. Documents and interviews reflect a ser1es of other incidents involving this family. On January 7, 1979, one of the girls' aunts reported to the Elk Grove Village Police Department that the sex\u00ad ual assaults had continued. The police interviewed the girls again but this time decided that nothing had transpired. When we asked why no report had been madel'to DCFS, the police admitted that a mistake may have been made in the case; an officer added that he was uncertain whether reporting in the particular instance had been mandatory. On January 2, 1980, the girls' brother attempted suicide. Police reports do not speculate concerning his reason for trying to hang himself; they do note that the boy was taking Tofranil for chronic bed-wetting, a drug that is also used to treat depres\u00ad sive states. One of the relatives suggested to \"the police that the stepfather had already sexu.ally assaulted the girls and now he was going after his stepson. Because the boy slipped in and (C'\\ ~' - $i \\ t I I I 1 I out of consciousness while hospitalized, he never told the police why he had attempted suicide. DCFS was called in and a caseworker was again assigned to the family. The family was also referred to CAUSES for the second time. On August 11, 1980, Marcia attempted suicide by swallowing thr.ee handfuls of phenobarbital. This attempt came to light only after Marcia told police of another sexual incident with her step\u00ad father. This report proved to be the catalyst for action with this family. On August 13, 1980, Marcia told Elk Grove Village police the following: on that same day, the stepfather had been asleep in his bedroom and Marcia had been in the living room. The stepfather came into the living room and escorted Marcia by the arm into his bedroom, laid her down on the bed, and removed his clothes. He undressed her \"and attempted to have intercourse with her. He failed to penetrate and Marcia managed to pull away and run to her own room, where she locked the door. Marcia told the police that, as in the past, her mother had not been home during the alleged incident. She added that her mother would never believe her and that she had believed neither her nor her sister two years earlier. Marcia told the police she was uncertain whether Lois had been sexually assaulted since the incidents of 1978; the two never talked about it. The police then called both the stepfather and mother to come to the station. The mO.ther said that she had to work, but the stepfather appeared with the three other children then in the home. When asked about Marcia's alleged suicide attempt, he admitted that it had happened but that he had called his wife at work and she recommended that he just keep Marcia walking around, that it was not too serious. When questioned about the allegation of sexual assault, the stepfather said 'that he did not remember. He admitted that he \"forgot some things\" and also stated that he could very well have molested his daughters while asleep. He added that he had been seeing a psychiatrist for his problems Since the sexual assault allegations of 1978. His private therapy had grown to include the entire family following hiE; stepson\"s suiCide attempt earlier that year. The Elk Grove Village Police Department investigation revealed that when the stepson was hospitalized following his suicide attempt, hospital officials aSked the police not to report the incident to DCFS pecause the family was under the care of .Dr. Nahman Greenberg. The police refused the request and. did contact DCFS. Fo'.llowing the alleged incident of August t 1980, DCFS again was contacted. At the first court hearing, CAUSES sent a worker to testify on behalf of the father. The hearing was continued, but later ',\\\\ the case was dismissed because of con~ licting state\u00ad ments by Marcia to defense counsel. CAUSES treatment with the family. -289-iW(' 6 ~~- ~--------- ------------~-~---- On October 19 1980 Lois attempted suicide, blaming the horne , : V'l situation for her mental state. Interestingly, the Elk Grove ~ ~ lage police have no record of the inci~ent; th7 State Central Reg~s\u00ad ter shows a report filed by the attend~ng hosp~tal; and the local DCFS office shows no report of the incident. -In fact we discovered an obvious problem with reporting. Th~ Elk Grov~ Village police have seven reported,in~idents in their records\u00b7 the State Central Register shows three ~nc~dents; the DCFS official file shows three incidents; and Cook County DCFS Intake records reflect only one. Following Lois' attempted suicide, the attending doctor took protective custody, and she was eve'ntually placed at Maryville Academy. The stepfather, who by this time was prohibited f;-om living in the horne, moved in across the street from the fam~ly. We discovered that, with the exception o~ the initial a~le\u00ad gations made in 1978, CPS workers did not bel~eve that the,g~rls had been sexually assaulted. They felt instead that the g~rls had fabricated stories to draw attention to themselves and to lash out at their stepfather. When questioned why the abuse allega\u00ad tions had not even been entered into the case record, one DCFS worker claimed that since they had not been proven, they could not be entered into the file. We spoke with a DCFS worker in charge of this case's contractual services. This person served as a liaison between DCFS and ~he, contractual agencies providing therapy and treatment to any fam~ly members. When we reviewed case documentation, we discovered that there was nothing to indicate the extent of treatment for the fam\u00ad ily the cost of this treatment to DCFS, what was being or had bee~ achieved, or even what the nature of the problem had been to begin with. We spoke with this worker's supervisor to d7termine why the:e were these problems with the case record. We po~nted out the a~ sence of billing sheets from CAUSES. He responded that not ~av~ng billings in the case record was not unusual. In fact, he sa~d, Dr. Greenberg and other CAUSES therapists accept referrals ,from DCFS and sometimes do not even bill the Department. He sa~d that sometimes the Department does not have the funds to pay fo~ ,ser\u00ad vices, and that other times CAUSES is paid by sources outsl.de of DCFS. He explained that federal grants could p~y for tre~tment of some cases~' The supervisor saw no problem wl.th referrl.ng cases in this way. We also questioned this person concerning why ,the 'stepfather had been allowed to remain in the home with the chl.ldren when there had been at least four allegations of sexual abuse within the past three years. He told us that keeping the stepfather in the home undoubtedly was part of the treatment pl~n develope~ by Dr. G,reen\u00ad berg. The supervisor said that \"incest ~s not consl.dere~ to~e a bad thing.\" He added that there was a growing theory,~n th~s country that incest has been with us through the centur~es and, -290-[1 ~ 1 I' i f 1) r I , i , I .. 1 ,6 '1 \" -., -or -I 'f1 -\\ ) J ~ I ~ ~ ,I Ji tl tJ I ,j i \u00b7'e'>\u00b7\" ... \u00b7,,':~_./. that sexual relationships within the family may not be bad. We asked the supervisor if he personally subscribed to that theory and he would not answer, although he did say that he kept an open mind. We then asked how he expected anyone in the general public--or the state legislature--to accept this \"new theory,\" and he said that it was about time people \"came down off their high-horse moral\u00adity and accept things as they are.\" We asked the supervisor how one could determine the nature of treatment being rendered by CAUSES from the case file, since nothing there showed what was being done with the family. He re\u00ad sponded that there was a mutual bond of trust between DCFS and Dr. Greenberg. He a.dded the Department did not require Dr. Greenberg to submit detailed reports on everything he did. Early in 1981, we asked the new CPS caseworker what had been done in terms of treatment by CAUSES. She told us that one of the CAUSES therapists, Debra Sachs, had participated in the in\u00ad vestigations of alleged abuse that were determined to be unfounded. The caseworker could not tell us how effective CAUSES' treatment had been. She told us that a new contractor, Horne Intervention Systems (HIS), would take CAUSES' place in treating the family. When we spoke with the caseworker two months later, she told us that the condition of the family had deteriorated. The entire family had been condemned by the community, adding to the family problems that precipitatep. the abuse. The caseworker felt that the police had not acted in the best interests of the children. She was one of the workers who felt the 1978 allegations were v~~id but that the girls had not been assaulted since that time. - We also spoke with the girls' Cook County Juvenile Court pro\u00ad bation officer. She t,old us that the girls met with their CAUSES therapist, Sachs, separately and that there never had been a fam\u00ad ily meeting or discussion concerning the case with Sachs. The last time that the probation officer had met with Sachs, she de\u00ad termined that Sachs had not seen either girl for more than a month. Early in 1981, DCFS Director Coler requested that then-CPS head Jeanine Smith prepare a summary of this particular case for his review. The review makes it clear that from September, 1978, to January 4, 1980, DCFS had no contact with the family except through CAUSES; apparently no one at DCFS was aware that CAUSES had withdrawn from the case on September 30, 1979. CAUSES became involved with:the family again on January 4 following another sex\u00ad ual abuse alleg\"/filtion. This time _the stepfather and mother asked to be referredro Dr. Greenberg for treatment. The summar~~states that DCFS' workers appear to have taken appropriate acticn regarding the case; the delegation of the case to CAUSES for t~~atme.nt was deemed correct. There is no' reference to quality or value of CAUSES' reports to DCFS. According to both caseworker and supervisor aSSigned to .the case, \"Dr. Greenberg -291-,j '\", --~,----- -- ~ can b~ ~rusted to do what is proper.\" Included with the summary are medlcal records that were furnished to the Commission after we were told that we had already received all documentation on the case. We learned of their existence and specifically requested copies of the material. On June 19, 1981, a Commission investigator spoke with the caseworker assigned to the famU,y following a Juvenile Court hear\u00ad ing. He said that the cost of treatment for Lois would be enor\u00ad ~ous and,he d~d,not know who would be able to pay for it. Also, It.was hlS oplnlon that the stepfather could very well have been gUllty of molestation while still asleep. ( We learned through a conversation 'with Assistant State's At\u00ad torney Bruce Paynter that the criminal case against the stepfather had been weakened considerably by a tape recording given to him by the stepfather's defense attorney. The recording, which \\, in\u00ad cluded statements by Marc;i,a, presented a story at odds with the story she had told the police. Paynter said that he had at first contemplated asking for a dismissal of charges but then requested a continuance to ,consider whether the case were prosecutable. Later, Paynter dld not oppose a motion for dismissal of crilninal charges and they were dropped. The protective order against the stepfather remained in effect. A Commission interview with the girls' grandmother revealed that there had been problems within the home for a long time. She,added that nothing had improved in the three years that the famlly had been receiving treatment from CAUSES. .. In ,June, 1981, we spoke with Marcia. At that time, she was llvlng ln the home. She mentioned that she had always gotten along,well with her sister but recently, when Lois visited from Maryvl~le Academy, her mother made them stay away from each other. ~he sald that.her mother was afraid that Lois might influence her ln some negatlve way. In June, 1981, Marcia reported that her mother had embarrassed her in front of the mother of one of her girlfriends. Her mother asked the neighbor why she allowed Marcia ~n her house, and said that ~ooner or later the neighbor was gOing to catch\"Marcia in bed wlth her husband just as the mother had. The mother said that she had found Marcia performing an act of oral sex on her husband. When we asked how she got al'bng with her DCFS caseworker she said that everyone except for the police sided with her m~ther and stepfather. She added that she had thus far been able to \"hold out\" and remain in the home, \"but she was afraid that constant pres-' sure from her mother and stepfather (when he visted) would force her to,. run away. '; ~. Marcia said that she had spoken to Dr. Greenberg only once. Shecfelt that he sided with her mother and stepfather. She said .her contact person at CAUSES was Debra Sachs. Sachs never talked about the alleged sexual assa\\llts but would only ask general ques\u00adtions, such as, \"How are you feeling?\" -292-1 ! ~ l~ . ;1 We also spoke with Lois while at Maryville Academy; at the same time we spoke with Maryville staff who were working with her. We asked one of the staff if Lois were being forced to visit her mother and denied visitation rights with both her aunt and step\u00ad mother, as we had heard from another source. We were told that the treatment plan is handled entirely by DCFS, and it was her understanding that DCFS' goal was to return the child to her par\u00ad ents. Furthermore, the program established for Lois had been de\u00ad veloped with that principle in mind. Whether Lois was sent home or placed elsewhere was out of the hands of Maryville staff. Maryville's Director, Father John Smyth, told us that his staff does make recommendations to DCFS and that in Lois' case he would strongly suggest that the Department not force LOis to return home. ,Father Smyth said that he had personally examined Lois and had read a P9ychiatric workup done on her fOllowing her suicide attempt. He determined that she had emotional problems with which she was only beginning to cope. At the same time, he had been pleased wi~h the progress that she had made. We had an opportunity to speak with Lois alone While at Mary\u00ad ville. She told us that she had attempted suicide because her mother had blamed her for what had happened with her stepfather. She added that after the suicide attempt, her mother sl'lOwed up at the hospital and put on a \"big act ,'II impress ing all of the hos\u00ad pital personnel with her supposed concern for her daughter. Lois told us that she was being forced to visit her mother at home and that when she goes home her stepfather is there. Be\u00ad cause she is ultimately supposed to be reunited with both mother and stepfather, she has to act as though she can get along with them. Lois felt as though none of her caseworkers had done anything to help her or her sister or brother. She told us that her case\u00ad worker had told her that the privileges she enjoyed at Maryville depended on the progress that she made In getting along with her mother and stepfather. Lois, like Marcia, had only talked once with Dr. Greenberg, and her contact at CAUSES also,was Debra Sachs. Lois said that Sachs only asked her general quest,:Lons, such as, IIHow are you feeling?\" Sachs never discussed the allegations of sexual abuse with Lois, either. According to Lois, Dr. Greenberg saw her mother and stepfather weekly. She did not know what they talked about. ., On ~ovember 25, 1981, Marcia left her borne and went to her grandmother's. She refused to return home and ultimately went to the Schaumburg Police Department to t.urn herself in on 110vember 29. Schaumburg police took temporary custody after she told them she refused to return home and called an advocate from Illinois Status Offender Services (rSOS). The advocate arrange:d placement for Marcia in f'oster care. Somewhat later, Marcia was placed tem\u00ad porarily with ner aunt. Onely a day or two after the \"second brief placement,' Marcia was placed. a third ti.me. 4# Marcia appeared in Ceek Ceunty Juvenile Ceurt en December 15, 1981, at which State's Atterney Revelle Peritz changed the petitien frem MINS te a neglect petitien se as net te reflect adversely en Marcia. The case was censelidated with petitiens en alIef the children in the family. At the hearing, the judge decided te centinue Marcia's third fester care place\u00ad ment. In Marchf 1982, the new DCFS casewerker and her superviser came te Cemmissien .offices te discuss the case. The casewerker teld us that she had net been assigned te the case very long, since appreximately Octeber, 1981. When we inquired abeut a service plan fer LeiS, we wer~ told that staff at Maryville werk cut a service plan. Then a pCFS caseworker will review the plan and appreve or reject it. Apparently the caseworker had approved Lois' plan. We were shewn a cepy .of the .original plan, which included a number Of geals te be met by LOis. Included ameng them was re\u00ad cenciliatien with the mother. When we peinted .out that it was our understanding that Leis had ne intention .of recenciling with her mether, the caseworker told us that it was just another ex\u00ad ample of Leis' trying to manipulate those invelved with her case. We also asked about the court .order barring the stepfather frem the home when Leis was present.. Neither the casewerker ner her supervisor had read the ceurt .order, nor ceuld they locate it in the case material that they had brought to the interview. ,They said that alIef these court .orders are alike, and, in any case, the specific court .order didn't matter because Maryville weuld preduce a service plan cengruent with the desires of the court. If they did net, at the next ceurt hearing the plan's de-' ficiencies would be .obvious. When we suggested that having Lois return home while a cri\u00ad minal actien was pending against her stepf:ather, and in which LO~S might be a witness, was impreper, neither the casewerker nor her supervisor felt that this actien could be confi,t:rued as tampering with a witness. The casewerker insisted that, based on her meet\u00ad ings with her, LoiS sincerely wanted to return home. We asked the superviser if the Maryv,ille placement were con\u00ad sidered temporary or permanent. He responded that Maryvill~ is censidered a permanent placement. We then wendered why LoiS hag been sent tea permanent placement, given the service goals for her. The supervisor explained that a placement is defj.ned by the contractual agency, not by DCFS. Maryville called itself a p~r\u00ad manent placement, he said, therefore it. was a permanent placement .. He added that the length .of stay in this-:-\"Permanent plapef,nentll weuld vary frem six months to several years. The supervisor also commented on this particular c\"ase.' He said that it is not uncemmonfer girls their age to act as Lois and Marcia had. He added that the twe girls had discovered how te use the IIsystemli to achieve their own ends. He mentioned that the Department had te work with poer resourc~s .Psychia~;ric(.) ser\u00ad vices in particular have beceme too told; the -294-I I I. l\", I' ;'\" ( 1 1 f o Department had centracted with Maryville partially because it ceuld net afferd other services that LeiS might need. He added that the Department rarely interferes with the service plan develeped by the contractual agency. He said that if toe many restrictiens were placed on contracters by tne Department, soen DCFS would be unable to contract with anyene fer any services. The superviser told us that contractors are given a 'good deal .of latitude in the development and implementatien of servi.::e plans in .order not to antagenize them. We learned during the interview that there was te be no cri\u00ad minal trial against the stepfather because the case had dragged on too long. The civil hearing to determine custody of the chil\u00ad dren was the only court action pending. This supervisor again repeated that the girls were typical .of many girls he had enceuntered in his professienal career. Re\u00ad garding placement of the girls with neighbors .or others in the community, he saj.d, liAs soon as .one of the girls becemes seduc\u00ad tive witq .one of thepar~nts, they'll throw the kid out. And this happens .over and over again.\" The supervisor reiterated that the service goal, for the chil\u00ad dren was family. reunification, beginning with meetings among all children and the parents. Appropriate agency staff would be in\u00ad vited to administrative case review meetings as needed. Hemade it clear that eventually the father would be brought back inte the heme permanently. This interView made it clear that DCFS expects centractual agencies to previde service plans, while centractual agencies claim that DCFS preduces such plans fer implementation. Surprisingly, neither the caseworker nor her supervisor had taken the time to review the case file. Neither was familiar \\Plith facts .of the case occurring before their Own personal involvement with it. Neither DCFS staff nor Maryville staff knew ~'lhat was\" centained in orders from the Juvenile Court, In spite of this ignorarice, treatment plans had been written up and implemented~ The initial reasen fer DCFS invelvement in the case was either lost .or ignered, partially because ne one attempted to review the case file. DCFS staff also chose not to seek additional information available to them. The initial allegations .of incest in the family had almost been fp:r,getten. The focus for the case in 1978 should have been protec.i:10n of the children and presecution and/or renabilitatien effcrts fer the stepfather.' In'1982, almost all ef\u00ad focus en addressing the two girls' non-delinquent but trouble\u00ad some behavior and the mother's emotienal problems. Yet, the DCFS plan remains as reunification of the entire family. \" As the DCFS superviser left .our .offices, he mentioned that he would not be surprised if the Department wound up with the two otper children from tliis family. He \"told us that they probably would be 'referred one at a time, for one reason or another, and that'Lo,is and Marcia would probably outgrow the system befere condu'?ted a ~umber of general and _ specific interviews, both in Illino~sand ~n other states, to de termine how the problem of incest is viewed ~y o~hers and to t identify specific treatment programs. This sect~on of the rePt:?r briefly highlights our findings; it is not meant to be exhaust.~ve. Family Sexual Abuse Program, Fairview Conullunity Hospi\u00ad tal, Edina, Minnesota, In February of 1981, ,an investigator met witt:-Miriam. ~ngebrits~n of the Family Sexual Abuse Program. We were part~cularly l.n~ereste in speaking with a representative of this program because, ll.ke . CAUSES, the program was one of the (special nationwide demonstratl.of,1 -296-r ! ---------~--------------------------------~,~ .. --- i J ,. research projects funded by the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect (NCCAN). Ingebritson mentioned to us that she has met with the directors of all of these projects on occasion. She added that CAUSES is run significantly differently than her pro\u00adgram. a-. The obvious and most significant difference between the two programs is that the Family Sexual Abuse Program treats families that have been referred to the criminal justi,ce system. Ingebritson felt that the involvement of the system was a significant aid in treatment. She admitted that she has treated clients who have had no involvement with the courts or other parts of the system; she felt that those that were so involved fared better in treat\u00ad ment. One of the advantages to court involvement was that it pre\u00ad vented families from moving away when therapy becomes too intense or emotional for the father or other family members to stand. Ingebritson,.;,said that it is natural to want to get away when a person is required to address behavior that is condemned by so\u00ad Ciety. Even a normal family would have a hard time enduring some of the rigors of intense therapy, and any incestuous family would have less of an advantage than a \"normal ll family. Another important reason to require court involvement is that society gives a man double messages if it allows him to commit the crime of incest, which in Minnesota is a felony, and then does nothing to bring him to the attention of legal authorities. It is important for the family to accept the responsibility for un\u00ad derstanding that incestuous behavior is a seriOUS breach of so\u00adcietal rule. We discussed with Ingebritson the problems we had encountered in Illinois between those ~Yho feel that human services is a treat\u00ad menb .. based ideology, while criminal justice is a punishment-based ideology. She told us that criminal-justice is much mOre than Simply punishment, and that the simplistic view that one must choose between punishment on one hand and treatment on the other is ludi\u00adcrous. Ingebritson emphasized the necessity for therapists to make it clear to clients that if incestuous .behaVior is reported dur\u00ad ing treatment, it will be reported to the appropriate law enforce\u00ad ment authorities. Not doing so, she pOinted out, feeds into the pathology of the incestuous family even more, because it allows them to think they are maintaining \"their little, secret\" even as they are being treated because of it. Ingebritson told us that in 3~ years of operation, her pro\u00ad gram has been successful fn 85% of it,s cases, and she conSidered that a conservative estimate a The 85% would refer to those fami\u00adlies that completed therapy more than a year previously and had remained incest-free. She hoped that her program could expand from its present, 12 IXlonths of therapy to 24. The first four months of treatment are intense, with 10-12 hours of therapy per week to begin. -297-, ~~ ~ \\, ~, ~ \" \\ ; ---------.-...----.-.-.....------------------------ Ingebritson felt that the father should remain out of the home during the first four months. It was her experience that incest does not cease upon discovery, in spite of research to the contrary. Furthermore, she felt a fundamental responsibility to protect the child victim. Third, if anyone should be inconvenienced as a result of incestuous behavior, it should be the offender, certainly not the child. Fourth, she has seen a dramatic change in mothers' behavior when the father is forced to leave tihe home, allowing the mothers to develop skills and the knowledge\\that they can indeed survive without their husbands. Finally, a family that really wants to succeed is self-motivated, including the father. She told us that if a father really wanted to stop assaulting his children and salvage his marriage, he should be willing to remain out of the home for as long as it might take to achieve those goals. Regarding funding, she felt that it was possible to run a cost-effective program without government financing. She felt that the \"welfare mentality\" of funding all incest treatment pro\u00ad grams because they could not otherwise survive was crazy. She thought that programs could charge for their services and that such a move would further remind clients that they live in the real world, a notion all too often lost on incestuous families. Ingebritson described her own progr'am as cost-effective. Her \"pro\u00ad gram schedules several families to meet together with a team of four or five therapists as a group. All of the therapists are familiar with the individual problems of the clients. ,This way, the program does not lose money by having each family come in singly to meet with a single therapist. Her therapists maintain extensive charts and records on all families referred to the program, not only for internal use, but also in therapy when a man might begin toCdeny that he ever as\u00ad saulted his daughter. ,Then they can show him a chart with a list of arrests and court hearings. Ingebritson said that these re\u00ad cords are exhaustively reviewed, both by the sponsoring hospital and also by NCCAN. Her program had also received approval from the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals. Irl summary, Ingebritson emphasized that the one thing that can damage therapy is allOWing,' the therapist to do too much. All involved parties need to know where the therapist's responsibi\u00adlities begin and end. 2. Child Sexual Abuse Treatment Program, Santa Clara county, California Commission ,investigators traveled to California to interview a number of people involved in child protection in that state. One of the interviewe(3s was Henry Giarretto, ,Ph.D., Director of Treatment and Training for the Child Sexual Abuse Treatment Program (CSATP), considered bytnany to be C!-p innovator in incest treatment. Giarretto is also the founder of the program. -298--~,,: ' t\u00b7 1: t ,- I , > ! I c officers, court personnel prosecutors). the self-help component (Parents Anonymous, Parents United, and ' D~ughters and Sons ~nited); and volunteers (who, according to G~arretto, can ampl~fy the effects of therapeutic treatment many t~mes over). The support systems came about when he realized early on that therapists could not handle the burden of incestuous fam\u00adily problems alone. We learned that in 1977 the CSATP became a state demonstra\u00ad tion center and that subsequently 30 additional centers modeled after this program were established in California. This in turn led to the program becoming a National Training Center the first of its kind and the only such program being copied acr~ss the country. Gj,arretto explained that basically his program takes a troubled family and ::esocializes its members through the efforts of many ~eopl:. ~h~le no one,therapist can do this alone, the therapist es~ent~al to coord~nate services honestly and impartially. , Giarretto's program works through the Santa Clara County Pro\u00ad b~t~on Department and therefqre is criminal justice-oriented. G~arretto feels that the criminal justice system needs to be in\u00ad ~olv~d in an i~ces~ treatment program because the reality fam\u00ad ~ly ~s faced w~th ~nvolves the courts. Giarretto was quick to add that no workable sy~tem can take an overly punitive stand against incest; reports will not come in and families will not ccme forward for treatment if that is the case. To Giarretto,' the biggest obstacle to doing a good job in therapy is \"getting over professional jealousy,\" the idea that one person is the only one who can perform a task or get something done. Cooperation is what allows a family to be treated success\u00adfully. , Giarretto went through the entire rE~ferral process for us so that we could compare how incest cases are handled in Illinois. In San Jose, where his program is located, when a case is reported to tbe Juvenile Probation Depa~tment, .the San Jose Police Depart\u00ad ~ent Sexual Aspault Investiga.tion Unit is notified and a jOint investigation is performed. The case is then referred back to a coordinator within the Juvenile Probation Department. The co\u00ad ordipator will then assign the case to a counselor, who is respon\u00ad sible for developing a therapeutic case plan and report back to tile police and any other appropriate profeSSionals, such as CPS workers.' Giarretto told us that 90% of the children referred are re\u00ad united with th~ir families, with a recidivism rate of less than ~%. Gia~~etto said that the key to the success of his approach ~s ~o be9~n,ther~~~ with the family immediately and not ,to wait unt~lthe d~spos~;c~on of the court case. His counselors also make a \"point of .:\u00b7providing the Santa Clara County Adult Probation Depa:t't:ment with information so that judges hearing' criminal co~\u00ad plaints can kr,iow how and ,.what the o~fender is doing in treatment. -29'9-.';\".l \" --- - ~~ -~-----~.~,-----~-- --~ ------~-~ Giarrette added in na\u00ad ture. . His therapists previde the ceurts with infermatien but de net attempt to' influence them ene way er anether. He teld us that the preblem with diversien pregrams is that if they fail to' werk, the time lag between arrest and determinatien that treatment has failed will destrey any criminal case that might have been prese\u00ad cutable. Giarrette also. had met with directers acress the ~ ferent frem he Greenberg to' \"make his peace with the system.\" Giarrette teld us that ten years ago he also. wanted to' treat families eutside ef the cri\u00ad minal justice system. He quickly learned that the appreach,wa~ counterpreductive to anyone who. really wants to' help beth v~ct~ms and offenders. Finally, Giarretto fel,t it important fer pregrams such as his to keep their beeks open for inspection by gevernment. The contrelling bedy and the funding seurce have to see what is ge~ng Ion he said, and they have to decide if the program is worthwh~le. iHe' added that cenfidentiality is a \"false to' is justa an henest evaluatien. He felt that the enly legitimate issue in this realm is maintaining anenymi~ of clients, which he saw as quite different from the confidentiality question. Giarretto's pregram has beceme the medel for fessionals continue to suggest that invelvement with the criminal justice system can be damaging to ,a t~erap:utic rela~i,?nshiI?' i~ cr~m~nal Just~ce system is excluded, as it is with CAUSES. lit Sexual Investigatien and Educatienal Unit, East St. Leu;~ pelice Department, East St. Leuis-;-Illineis f; 3. In 1980 we interviewed Sergeant Jqhn E. Bmith and Detective Deborah Guyton ef this unit. Not eve.r:r!/ pelice j;turisdictien has a unit such as this ene, so. it was j;l1teresting,tlolearn how it werks. Smith and Guy ten agreed thaf because mest child sexual assault occurs in the heme, there is a preblem with presecution. Often offenders never are identified; other times the offenders cenvince the victims net to testify. Smith and Guy ten estimated that fewer than one third of all sex effenses cO.mmitted against children are reperted. They added that a DCFS superviser once told them that thepelice de not see 99% ef the sexual abuse cases seen by DCFS. The efficers suggested that incest case reports are not made because these cases frequently fail in ceurt, thus becoming a self-fulfilling prephecy'fer peep Ie 'adverse to' repert\u00ad ing because they it futile. The two. efficers agreed that DCFS centacts them regarding incest cases enly \"'1..,rhen the breaking peint is near c \" This places the pelice at a disadvantage because the families they encounter\" -300-~ I . i\\ -~~--- are always extremely disturbed. a result, often the pelice beceme the \"fall guys\" in these cases and are blamed fer escalat\u00ad ing problems already present within the families. ':;\\ Neither Smith ner Guy ten had ever seen an incest case that they had 'werked on go to' court. They felt that the St. Clair County State's Attorney had a problem presecuting such cases and estimated they had heard ef enly three incest cases that had gene to ceurt in the. entire county. Finally, Smith and Guy ten handle all cases of sex crime in East St. Leuis and also previde educatienal their educatienal ef\u00ad ferts were handled on their own time. Just recently, counselors had been added to' their team to' werk with the victims ef sexual assault. 4. Child Sexual Abuse Treatment and Training Center of Illi\u00ad !:le~s, Inc., the pregram named abeve (CSATTC), a greup formed in 1 976 by Ryan and\" Sandra Gay lerd. The pregram' s precepts are taken from Giarrette's program in Califernia, and it maintains a charter frem, Giarrette's program. Ryan teld us that, his program is geared only teward treatment ef incest viC\u00ad tims and members ef their families. ,.when it incerperated in 1979, it received a contract from DCFS to serve 10 families at one time. Seen thereafter, 23 families had been referred by DCFS. At the time ef eur ,first interview, in September, 1980, CSATrrc was serving 39 families., Ryan told us that he had to' put a held en all DCFS referrals because the Department could net keep up payment. Ryan teld us that his agency had a centract with the Aurora Regien ef DCFS. Fer 'seme reason, he had been unable to get a cen\u00adtract to' serve any clients frem Cook County, in spite of efforts to do s6. Ryan had received a few referrals of families living only a few blocks from his office, but across the ceunty line. Because of no contract with Ceok County DCFS, the only way these families ceuld receive services from 'the CSATTC would be for the family to move\\l across the county line or pay fer therapy completely eut of their ewn peckets. \\\\ Ryan told us that the CSATTC works well with crimina:ll courts but prefers noninvolvement if possible. Ryan explained tlJat he . pr~ferred to work in conjunction with the JuVeni~e C9urt ,ecause of a similarity in goals between the ceurt and h~s ag:ncy. \\' Ryan r s program is structured to' focus en preventing future s~tuatJ,\\ens within the heme that could lead to incest recurring. The Pfogram werks sepCl.rately with the offender, the Victim, and the Wif~;~ Eventually the three are breught together for group sessiens~h' The final step is to' bring any additienal family in f'~r counseling. . , \\ -301-)) .. .~~---------------------- Of the 39 referrals at the time of the first interview, 17 were involved with criminal court and eight with Juvenile Court, eight had no court involvement, and six were self-referred, pay\u00ad ing clients .. Robinson mentioned that sometimes it is difficult to culti\u00ad vate a good relationship with the State's Attorney of a given county because he is vulnerable to political attack and pressure. Robinson added that a State's Attorney in any county in Illinois except Cook County is under tremendous pressure.if he charges a person with incest but the person does not end up in jail. . Robinson's comments refer to the five counties in which the CSATTC works: Will, Kane, Kendall, DuPage, and Grundy. We last spoke with Ryan in July, 1981. Ryan had had a series of meetings with other therapists in the area in order to put to\u00ad gether a more comprehensive treatment program, ultimately called HELP, Inc. After three months of being involved with the larger project, Ryan decided to terminate his association with it. He felt that the project had taken too much of his time from th~ CSATTC. 5. Human Effective Livin I l.nol.S We interviewed a number of people regarding the treatment philosophy and 'effectiveness of this new incest treatment program. Gabrielle (Gaby) Cohen, director of the agency, gave us a copy of a report dated January 12, 1982, that assesses the early his\u00ad tory of the agency. The agency was developed to implement a model for joint investigations of child sexual abuse by the Chicago PI.)\u00ad lice Department, DCFS, and HELP, Inc.; to develop, coordinate, and effect procedures for the involvement of criminal and juven~.le courts with the treating agency; to develop treatment procedures'~; that are \"victim-sensitive\"; to develop a treatment model that t would include the entire family; to develop methods of collec;t- \\' ing, preserving, and sharing informat.ion, evidence, and progress reports among all interested parties; to identify changes in policy needed to bring about the above; and to develop a training courri\u00ad culum to teach the necessary skills needed for effective investi\u00ad gations and follow-up in court. Cohen told us that the project was geographically restricted to Chicago Police Department Area 6. The program would not get involved with an offender with a history of violence or heavy drug abuse. She said that these offenders rarely benefit from such a program. While the program technically began in April, 1981, it did not gain momentum until August of that year. In the period covered by the evaluative report, the project was involved with about 30 cases. Of the cases, four offenders had been through the entire criminal justice process and had'received sentences of probation contingetit upon their agreeing to att~nd counseling seSSions 'With counselors from HELP. Cohen estimated that most offenders would be in treatment for 18 months. -302-~ I I I j -~.~ ~~------- Cohen explained how her project receives referrals. When the DCFS hotline receives an incest allegation it is referred first to DCFS' Division of Child Protection (DCP), which refers it to Child Protective Services (CPS), which refers it to the North Area Office, which finally refers it to HELP. Cohen hoped that by January, 1982, DCP and CPS could be eliminated from the routing process. -Cohen told us that the program begins working on a case by bringing together at the police station all of the involved par\u00adties: victim, alleged offender, other family members, witnesses, representatives of the necessary agencies, and therapists from . HELP. At this time, the therapists try to determine from the Vl.C\u00ad tims just what had occurred. Cohen mentioned that her therapists were particularly skilled at getting incest victims to open up about their experienc~s. While her workers attempt to develop a rapport with the vic\u00ad tim, police officers inte~view the alleged offender. At times, HELP staff i~~called in ~b offer the police a diagnostic assess\u00ad ment of the?r. .. ~]:her or to explain the treatment process in which he may be involved. HELP staff also offers the police guidance concerning the psychological makeup of the people with whom they are dealing. Cohen emphasized that HELP provides treatment to the entire family, including the offender. She said that her staff emp~a\u00ad size.s to the family that such treatment will not stop followl.ng the initial encounter at the police station. Both victim and of\u00ad fender are told that they will be offered a long-term, viable, concrete treatment plane Cohen told us that she does not feel her agency uses the court as a punitive force against the offender, but rather that the court functions as a means of controlling and forcing the offender to accept responsibility for his actions . Often the entire family; needs restructuring, she added, which can require the fulcrum of the courts. Cohen told us that she had been successful in getting State's Attorney Richard Daley to offer \"vertical prosecution\" in incest cases a system through which the same assistant state's attorney remai~s with a case throughout the life of the prosecution. Ob\u00ad viously, such a pract.ice improves any case, but .it is par~icularly important in a case in which a prosecutor needs to establl.sh a. relationship with a child victim, and other members of the faml.ly. Cohen described her program as \"Victim-oriented,\" and felt that /if the family setting were not injurious to a child's well\u00ad bein.g the child should not be \"punished\" by being forced out of the h~me. She felt that the offender had to remain out of the honle for a time to prevent explosive feelings from erul?tin~, and . to allow other family members to establish or reestabll.sh l.mportant familial ties . The mother is forced to learn coping behavior, and the family as a whole must decide how to handle possible future incestuous acts. -303-, .-------..-......-----~----- ----- --_. -- At the same time, Cohen said, the offender is being protected, in a sense. He is prevented from repeating his behavior if it ~s compulsive, ~y being forced out of the home. The father also 2S protected ~gainst false charges from family members and others. T~e fathe~ st211 sho~ld support his family, Cohen said, and HELP w2l1 prov2de counsel2ng to help all family members understand the necessity of his staying out of the home for a time. A Chicago Police Department officer who had worked with the program told us that it has been helpful to have HELP counselors and therapists at the station to begin i~~ediate work with a fam\u00ad ily. I~ makes it easier for the police to elicit cooperation from all f~m2ly members . Furthermore, he said that what happens with a fam21y after a po12ce investigation is completed lies outside ~f the pol~ce department's purview. A family could easily dis- 2ntegrate 2f offered no therapy, and there is nothd.ng the police can do about it. Having a group such as HELP involved at the start makes it less likely that such disintegration will occur. . ,This officer prai~ed HELP's ~mmediate response, the agency's tions ~f i~s role, and the agency's ability to provide for open . ~ommunlca~2on and closer contact among the important professionals 2nvolved 2n a case. He said that HELP staff and the police had developed a spirit of mutual trust that was quite valuable and that is often missing between the police and DCFS. He added that HELP staff are trusted not to hide facts and that HELP staff trust the police to act in the best inte~ests of t~e child. We also spoke with several Cook County Juvenile Court per\u00ad sonnel. Most were quite positive in their comments concerning HELP. One of them recommended that the project be implemented city-wide; another felt that the concept was good but that it was d~ubtful that the project could be replicated in all areas of the' c2ty. Another person int.erviewed felt that it was too soon to discuss the success/failure ratio of the 'project since most of HELP's cases had yet to go to court at the time ~f our interviews. We were told t.hat HELP counselors had done an excellent job preparing child victims to testify. They were also praised for helping the police to understand the emotional trauma experienced by these victims. Several interviewees compared HELP staff to DCFS caseworkers, noting the disparity of both approach and results. HELP counselors were active in participating in case discussions but would not \"step on toes of the other professionals involved with a case\" u HELP'S program was complimented for 'its philosophy and abi\u00ad lity to work with all fa~ily members, and for its ability to pro\u00ad vide immediate help. (!,.\"; . ,An assistant ,state's attorney prai~ed the program for its ab2l2ty to get ch21d victims to testify in court. She described the program as being even mOFe involved with the criminal justice -304---~-----~----- .. -~---. - - .~. system than Giarretto's program in California. She agreed with others that the agency has not been \"obstructionist\" and that its staff know not to overstep the boundaries of their own expertise. We were also given criticims of this agency's approach. Some court personnel did not feel that HELP staff was fully quali\u00ad fied to do the sensitive work for which they had been hired. One person told us that he wondered if HELP staff. would report con\u00ad tinuing incestuous behavior discovered during therapy to the court. He said that this would remain a cloudy area until some of the cases reach the probation stage, at which time such behavior may surface. In general, HELP has been received positively by most of those involved with it. Everyone seems ,to agree that the concept behind the agency is a good one, but there remain questions concerning its ultimate effectiveness. The program has not operated long enough to be evaluated meaningfully. Thus far, however, the pro\u00ad gram has been successful in providing services to a geographically limited portion of. the city. E. conclusion The following quotations are excerpts from Rachell Anderson's brief 1978 article \"Sexual Abuse ESegins at Home.\" They are in\u00ad structive because they were published at about the time our investi\u00ad gation began, because their perspective is somewhat more Illinois\u00ad based than other research, and because the comments are still general enough to be valuable: Incest is more serious, from a therapist's point of view, than is sexual abuse. (It is more difficuLt because by the time it is discovered, the process and the effects have taken their toll with Ii its victims.) Incest is a conditioning process which affects die daughter and the mother. The mother is conditioned to accept the incest, and in many cases, pretends that it is not happening. The daughter's conditioning begins with: 1) frequent body contact, 2) fondling, 3) genital contact, 4) and, eventually intercourse. In many cases, a number of years have passed since the process began. No one knows just how many cases of 'incest and sexual abuse there are. In a study done in 1967, the American Humane Society reported that one out of eyery four girls [isJ sexually abused before she reaches the age of 18. The National Center of Child Abuse and Neglect estimates that there \"are approximately 100 tOOO cases of incest each year. Many workers in the field believe this to be a cons,~rvati\\:,e figure. There still remain many unrecognized, unreported and underrated cases. In 75-80 percent of th~ reported cases of sexual abuse, the perpetrator is known to the child. Of these, 38 percent are the child's natural father. The average age of the victim is 11; however, reported cases have shown children -305-as young as 8 months old being victimized. Venereal disease has also been found in girls as young as 2 years old. The child who is a victim of incest and sexual abuse becomes confused in the mixture of roles which she is playing (i.e., father's lover, father's daughter, mother's substitute, mother's enemy or rival). There is also a lot of confusion about how she is treated by her siblings. There is envy as well as hostility moving back <?-nd forth between them. Fe,el\u00ad ings of being powerless to do anything about the situation for fear of what it will do to the family and to herself are com\u00ad plications with which she has to deal. In many cases, the female victim of incest or sexual abuse be\u00ad gins to see herself as some kind of \"monster\" and feels \"every\u00ad one is looking at me.\" W.e see these ebservatiens repeated in the'research and in case studies presented in this chapter. We also. nete' that sexual abuse eften is a phenemenen that repeats itself ever time: the victim ef ene abusive incident prebably is mere prene to. be sexually vic\u00ad and. Secrecy\" quete a 23-year-eld fermer victim of sexual abuse: think the reasen why a let ef kids den't de anything, den't tell anyene, is because an adult is an autheri.ty figure and semehew they have been forced to. de semething wreng by an autherity, and therefere it must have been right.\" This attitude extends bey end submissien to. men who. are net m~mbers ef the family to. fathers, uncles, and ether family members. Because ef their unique status in the family, children are cenvinced that they must go. aleng w~\\th their ,. shewed that almost half ef tbe victims they studied had been victimized by family members. Th.ey add: \"Four ef the effenders were i.nvelved with the victims, wl).ich emphasizes the frequency. with wQ.ich one family member is able to gair. access to. mere than ene f,emal,e er male child in the\" family. One reason that these people have repeated access to. the child is because they are family members and their presence is net questiened by the family.\" Finally, the authers refer to. the problems that develep as these sexual assaults are kept secret. Victims develep 'fears and tensiens that escalate as time passes. Seme v~ctims fear being blackmailed many years \u00b7later. Seme wemen fear that their husbands will discover that they had been sexually melested as children. Others experience a \"flashback\" to. their yeuth, usually when they are engaging in sex as adults. Such flashbacks may net eccur each time that a woman engages in sex, but when they de occur, they bring with them all ef the pain and other emetiens the weman e:x:perienced as a child~ The authers peint out that a series ef such flashbacks can cause serious neureses. -306-. l - ./\u00b71 , !) \", ~ I I, :s .\"1 r,'r i I CASE 1 \" 2 3 4 .s 6 CEILD'S AGE SEX 4 I F 1 8 F 11 F 13 F 14 F 14 F CHARACTERISTICS OF 14 CASES OF INCEST* FAMILY/MARITAL CIRCUMSTANCES SITUATION OF INCEST Lived with stepfather; work; svep- lJome caring father's second for children. marriage.

Henry Kempe entitled \"Incest and Other Forms of Sexual Abus,e,\" the authors claim that no one economic stratum or race experiences more incest than any other. They also emphasize that when ~ child says that he or she has been molested, the child should be believed unless there is evidence that the child is lying for a reason. The Kempes state: \"Orogenital molestation may leave no eVidence, except the child's story, which should be believed--children do not fabrj,cate stories of detailed sexual activities unless they have witnessed them, and they have, indeed, been eyewitnesses to their own abuse.\" The credibility of incest victims is also stressed by the late Dr. Joseph J. P~ters in a 1976 work,entitled \"Children Who Are Victims of Sexual Assault and the. Psychology of Offenders.\" He said that children simply do not fantasize sexual assault, and a professional believing that they do could leave a child un\u00ad protected and subject to repetition of the original assault. Un\u00ad fortunately, the Cornntission came across _just this belief even with- in DCFS. '- Another important idea brought out in the Kempe research and echoed by ~\\Tilliam R. Shelton's \"A Study of Incest II (1975) f is that despite the claims of shock and anger exhibited by the mothers of incest victims, most know that their husbands are engaging in sexual activity with their daughters. These mothers'lf i especially in long-term abuse cases, allow the incestuous behavior to con\u00ad tinue and should not be considered completely free of blame de\u00ad spite the fact that they are likely to escape the punishment im\u00ad posed on their husbands. The Commission found this to be true in many of the cases examined during 'the course of this investi\u00ad gation. Our research and case studies have indicated that the reac\u00ad tions of incest victires to the crimes committed against them can be varied and severe. In the 1977 article \"Father-Daughter Incest\" by Judith Herman and Lisa Hirschman, the authors cite extremely poor self-images,feelings'of being eVil, and, in later life, poor relationships with men as some commonly shared problems of incest victires they studied. Dr. Peters, in \"Children Who Are Victims,\" stated that a child can suffer extr'eme emoticnc;ll damage even if an assa,ult is ,a one\u00ad time occurrence only, as long as the child, has to continue to live in the 'home with the offender. Peters discovered that many vic\u00ad tims,are extremely angry a.t the offender but may not project their anger onto him; it may be directed elsewhere, including at the mother which, he adds, ,is of tell just.if ied. An article by l'-1eir Gross titled \"Incestuous Rape: A Cause for Hysterical Seizures in Four Adolescent Girls\" (1979), focuses \" on cases of incest in which, the victims were physically assaulted by fathers who were in some way under the influence of alcohol; however,'the other effects of the incest are the same as those -309-~ \" I. .. ;1 .~ ;j ~ ;~ ~ ~ fi a aa ; AS a suffered by victims of less aggressive relationships. The girls studied lived in almost constant fear of being raped again and exhibited very high levels of fear and anxiety. But they aI'so felt a great deal of guilt, just as other incest victims do; they all attempted either to run away or commit suicide. Gross pro\u00ad poses that the girls' hysterical seizures were defense mechanisms. He concludes that, any doctor encountering an adolescent girl who experiences hysterica~ seiz~res or similar behavior should check into her family dynamics for the posSibility of incest. Gross' conclusion points to a problem we noticed during our investigation: the tendency of the \"system\" to focus on the reac\u00ad tions of incest victims to their abuse instead of the abusive situa\u00ad tion itself. \"The Character-Disordered Family: A Community Trea-tment Model Family Sexual Abuse\" by Lorna M. Anderson and Gretchen Shafer (1979) presents findings of the Ramsey County Child Abuse Team of the Ramsev County Mental Health Department. Of particular note is a cornment'ary in the article that comes from a passage qealing with court involvement: In our experience voluntary cooperation is usually short lived at best. W,ithout authoritative intervention the family dynam\u00ad ics, including the sexual abuse, continue as soon as the family can close its door on the conce~ed professionals. Moreover, we have found that the authoritative approach facilitates treat\u00ad ment rather than creating an. obstacle to the establishment of a treatment relationship, as is often assumed. Such an. approach is usually the only community response that effectively counters the denial and the projection these adults typically display. Often, they do not see anything wrong with themselves'-or ,their behavior, and they are rarely motivated to change ,on their own. The community sanction of a criminal charge, and court order or placement of' their children, is often necessary to get these parents meaningfully involved in a treatment propess. Through the case studies presented in this chapter and our examination of the literature and treatment programs both in Illinois and throughout the country, the central dynamics \"of incest are clear. Authorities in this field are usually in agreefuent; how\u00ad ever, the one area of disagreement has to do with how the offender should be treated, and this conSideration can affect treatment and therapy. Generally, there are two camps: those who believe the offender should be brought into the criminal justice process to ensure his attention to the crime and participation in therapy, -and those who feel that therapy cannot be acb~eved ,. if the offender is made to face the possibility of convictio:h~and imprisonment. . Although this polarity eXists, the vast majority of 'incest Gtuthori\u00ad ties, and the vast majority of incest. treatment programs, feel that the offender must be invo'lved in the crim:i,nal justice system. This involvement is thought to be more effective and more equitable, regardless of tr,~atment modalities j \\1 The issue of criminal justice system involvement also leads to a discussion of the relationships between workers in the law enforcement and in the social service cow~unities. As we have seen in Qur case studies, the relationship is often an uneasy one. However, it need not be, as was pointed' out in the 1980 article \"Police and Social ~vorker Cooperation: A Key in Sexual Assault\u00b7 qases\" by Jon R. Conte, Ph.D., Lucy Berliner, and Sgt. Donna Nolan. The article reports on a cooperative project between the King County Police Department of Seattle (represented in the article by Sgt. Dolan) and the Sexual Assault Center of Harborview Medical Center of Seattlec(represented in the article by Berliner). The article presents generous statistics on individual cases studied in which the social workers from the Sexual Assault Center worked closely with police officers from the King County Police Department. Many of the statistics are case-specific and would be meaningless for our purpose9 here. The article mentions that many police offi\u00ad cers feel uncomfortable handling cases of child sex crime; the project was designed to teach the officers how to handle victims of such crimes as well as to familiarize social workers with the procedures of thepo~ice in such cases. The focus of '\" the proj ect was cooperation, so that workers in both areas could understand and work with each other. The project seems to have been a suc\u00ad cess, as the following excerpt indicates: ~or the police, this close working relationship with social workers was based on the confidence that social worker9 now better understand the working of the criminal justice system and the .realities and frustrations of the police role and re\u00ad sponsibilities. Police voiced the opinion that they could rely on social workers to present accurately the problems and requirements of family involvement in the criminal justice sys\u00ad tem. In addition,\u00b7 they indic~ted that the availability of so= cial workers to deal with the emotional reactions of sexually abused children and their families freed the police to pursue their investigative and reporting responsibilities. One of the points behind such a project seems obvious: the roles Of the police, representatives of 'the criminal justice sys\u00ad tem, and social work agencies should hot be completely separate. Goals of the. criminal justice system should be congruent with those of social~workers. Employees from each area should under\u00ad stand that they\" are limited in theil;\" areas\" of expertise~ frequently, for a case to be happily resolved, the investigative skills of the police, the legal skills of the State'l? Attorney's Office, and the diagnostic and therapeutic Skills of social workers must be intertwined. ' In order for thfa goals of the criminal justice system to be congruent with those of social workers, the criminal aspects of incest have to be studied. J. E'. Hall Williams,,., in his 197.4 article entitled- \"The Neglect of Incest: A Criminologist's View,\" concludes that crim.inologists have paid far less attention to incest than have social anthropologists. As a result, the information we have regarding the crime of incest is scarce because many autnors view it as a social problem rather than approach it from a criminolo- -311\"; I\" I a 4 i J 44 a 1 iii 1 , ~. I II /' /~I :, 1<.. I. Ii I I, )) gist's point of view. Williams calls for additional research by criminologists. Despite the many studies and views presented dealing with incest and sexual abuse treatment, there is little information available dealing \\vithprevention. One. source we did find, how-' ever r is called The Silent Children: A Book for Parents AbOl.lt the Prevention of child Sexual Abuse, by Linda Tschirhart Samord. Most important in preventing such abuse, Sanford writes, is establishing the appropriate family atmosphere. Such an atmosp\u00ad here will teach children to be \"nonvictimsll by teaching them self\u00ad confidence. Sanford recommends that parents offer their children very specific praise, but adds that criticism also should be of\u00ad fered to children. Sex-role stereotyping should be avoiged be\u00ad cause it makes .girls more prone to be victims and boys afraid to run away from situations. Sanford feels that parents should think of information about sexual abuse as just additional \"survival information,\" similar to, \"Dress warmly because it's cold outside, II and that such sur\u00ad vival information should be given matter-of-factly and repeatedly. She adds that information about sexual abuse need not be explicit as long as the message gets across. Sanford adds that parents should be certain to teach' their children the d;i.fference between a secret, which is never told, and a sur,prise~ which is most fun when it is told. She feels that parents should teach their children to partiCipate in surprises but never in secrets. '.' In a 1969 study directed by Vincent DeFrancis entitled 'Pro- tecting the Child Victim of Sex Crimes committedb* Adults, i?'FQ= tective intervention is viewed as crucial to attac ing the crime of sexual assault against children: I \\1 communities must reverse the pattern of service emphasis.' Greater emphasis must be placed on a preventive focus. Protective, preventive programs must be enlarged. Funds must:! be made avail\u00ad able so that the size, scope, andl~ffectiveness of protectiye and preventive programs may be sufficiently improved to meet actual need. Intervention must occur at the earliest possible stage to prevent development'of the problems into full blown crisis situations. That children sho,uld be sexually abused is a tragic occurrence but it is umneasurably more tragic to find that many children could h(\\ve been spared the traumatic experience if preventive services had been made avaiJable to their families when the first signs of family breakdown became visible'. In conclu9ing this section we note that, like other forms of child maltreatmfjht, iflcest is being reported more today than ever before. Also, incest is becoming a priority for treatment in most al;:\".eas.

The Department also provides agen\u00ad cies and individuals with grants through which they may provide services to the Depar'tment or to its wards. Contractual agenc ies 'and agencies working through grants provide the bulk of ser~Jce to all DCFS clients. ~ Grants and contracts may range from a ~\\hort\u00ad term agreement with a psychiatrist I)t,o. provide a few hours ofdiag\u00ad nostic evaluation every month, to complete programs that have be\u00ad come totally dependent on .DCFS for funding. The agencies described in this section of the report are re\u00ad presentative Of agencies providing child protective and child wel\u00ad fare services in the state, although the agencies were not chosen at random. In all cases, we were led to these agencies by the development of our investigation. Contracted services to clients include diagnostic assessments, foster care, help ,in securing adoptive care for children, group horne placement, supervised living programs (including independent living), counseling, therapy, classes in parenting, and a variety of other services. Almost any need expressed by a DCFS client may' be met through contractual aid. . A. Calumet City Youth & Family Services 'l'he Commission looked into the operations of the Calumet City Youtp & Family Services in ,1979, about a year after this investi\u00ad gation began. The agency, a funded department of Calumet City, is also funded through grant programs of the Illinois Law Enforce\u00ad ment COImnission .and the federal Law Enforcement Assis~ance Adminis\u00ad tration (now defunct). Investigators spoke with Daniel Kelly and Elaine Krueger con\u00ad cerning the agency's operations. They told us that the agency had developed programs in \"pre-parenting and parent information' services.\" Tliey described these as programs which could prevent potential oases ,of emotional or physical abuse. The agency had several ideas concerning actual therapeutic techhique r including role-play and the establishment of a \"Kids Anonymous\" group, Similar to Parents Anonymo'us but run entirely by children,'with support from ,agency workers and school counselors. I! Kelly and Krueger said that their agency also waC? responsible for determining what services and programs were availabl,e in the comm\\)nity. They viewed aWctreness of local programs as a preven\u00ad tive measure. Awareness and publicity were particularly important, they felt, in the area of child abuse and neglect. -315-'.- T~ \\' ----'- -~----~ .1 This agency provides basic coun.seling and related services and does not depend on DCFS for funding. It is a representative example of a community-funded program providing services to a spec\u00ad trum of clients, including abused and negected children and their families. B. Citizens Committee for Children and Parents Under Stress 'l.'he CCCPS, otherwige known as Parental Stress Services, is located in Chicago. In 1979, we spoke with Sally BrUckner, Execu\u00ad tive Director. Bruckner told us that the agency was started in 'l974 as the Citizens Committee for Battered Children and origi\u00ad nally focused its efforts on legislation and child advocacy. She said that the agency had become more direct-service oriented over the years because contract money it receives from DCFS requires direct services to clients. Bruckner said the agency provided four major services: 1) Referrals to communit.,y agencies for counseling and re\u00adlated services. 2) A 24-hour hot line handling calls of abuse and neglect, staffed by volunteers . 3) 4) Out-reach visits by volunteer workers to help diffuse family problems and crises. These visits may either be emergency or long-t~rm. County. . # Sponsorship of the 35 Parents Anonymou,sij groups in Cook Most of the CCCPS staff' d6nsists of ~oordinators for these\\:; four functions, although there also is a clinical director. CCCP$, at the time of our interview, received $200,000 a year, primarily 11 from the Kellogg Company and the Joyce Foundat(ion. DCFS provided, $32,400 ip grant funding and $7,350 in con~ractual funding. Ali combination of funding from the United Way, corporatesolicita\u00ad tion, and individual gifts pr~vided about $36,000 of the budget. Bruckner told us that, in order to receive state funds, CCCPS had to approach DCFS and \"sell\" its services. CCCP$ was willing to a1:ter existing programs to fit the needs and requirements Of the Department. At the time of the interview, DCFS needed assis\u00ad tance in liaison work with private agencies, in providing services to the Elk Grove Village Youth Agen.cy, and in servicing some of the more problematic areas of Chicago. But overal~, she said, her agency's relationship with DCFS was quite good. In spite of this excellent relationship with DCPS, however, she told us that she had to learn financial record-keeping mostly on ~~r owh and could have benefitted from assistance or guidelines from DCFS re\u00ad garding what should be included on forms in order for CCCPS to be reimbursed. \" CCCPS apparently sometimes treats cases of child abus,e ~with\u00ad out reporting to DCFS. When t-le asked Bruckner about this, she responded that the agency feels its methods of diffusing problems -316-\\, f' in the home are quite effective. Further, she said she felt that many of the people being serviced would never c-ome to the atten\u00ad tion of DCFS7 with CCCPS involvement, at least they would receive some help. Regarding the issue of specific problems at DCFS, Bruckner said that caseworkers were given too heavy caseloads, cthat workers often had to share a sing-Ie telephone at the main office at 1026 South Damen in Chicago, and that the offices are dirty and depress\u00ad ing. She felt that conditions could be improved, at the very least. Although Bruckner was enthusiastic about CCCPS' relationship with DCFS many of her comments were criticisms of how the ,system was being' run in 1979. Regarding the condition of the off1ce,at 1026 South Damen, we also found it to be in bad shape. It~ f11es were not secure and were poorly organized, as we have ment10ned elsewhere. C. Lutheran Social Services In June of 1981 a Commission investigator interviewed the Reverend Gary D.. Stubenvoll, Vice-Pres ident and Director, of So\u00ad cial Services fer Lutheran Social Services. The agency 1S owned by the Lutheran Church and serves more than 150,000 people per, year through 70 programs. Its budget for FY,81 was over $22,m11- lion. Founded in 1867 to care for orphans, 1t has expended 1tS services to the area of foster care and related needs. The ,agency does not work only with children,; it has pro~ram~ for a,var1ety of individuals with specific problems. F~nd1ng,1s prov1d~d by a variety of sources beSides the church, 1nclud1ng the Un1ted Way, foundations, and private individuals. Programs designed for children include housing and,coun.sel\u00ad ing for troubled adolescents a~ the Nachusa Home nea~ D1~on7 the Edison\"park Home in Park Ridge; Fox Hill Group Home 1n,D1xon; and the Lutheran Group Horne in Sterling. Stubenvoll e~pla1ned that while children are involved in residential counsel~ng at these facilities, their parents also receive counseling,at ~ome,so that their children can make a smooth transition from 1nst1tut1onal living to the family home. D Lutheran Social Services als,o ope:r::ates nine day care program: in conjunction with the City of Chicago's Department ,of Human ~e: vices and runs a care facility for developmentally d1sabled ch11 dren in Chicago. Stubenvoll told us that his agency receives referrals ~rom private agencies, the Board of Education in Chicago, the Un1~ed Way, the Department of Mental Heal7h, and ~ -' \\ I ----- ----~---.-- Prior to 1969, the agency had been involved in foster care. When DCFS Director Weaver took over, he insisted that the responsi\u00ad bility for foster care rests in the public sector~-DCFS--and Lutheran Social Services pulled out o~ the field. According to Stubenvoll, DCFS failed to monitor its foster care programs, suf\u00ad ficiently and some of the children became IIl0st in the system.1I Stubenvoll contrasted DCFS' inability to keep track of foster chil\u00ad dren and provide parents with reinforcement with the prior per\u00ad formance of his own agency. At the time of our interview, Lutheran Social Services had contracts with DCFS only for sexual abuse counseling and related services in SterliQg, Dixon, and through the Peoria Area Office. Stubenv611 said that his workers experienced a high IIburnoutll rate and had to be rot!ated periodically when working in these programs. Finally, Stubenvoll recommended the implementation of multi\u00ad disciplinary teams to treat cases of child abuse and neglect. D. Home Intervention Systems During our discussion of one of the incest cases, we refer to Home Intervention Systems (HIS) in Palatine. As noted, all treatment is provided in the home. The goal of the agency in pro~ viding such in-home services is to keep families intact. The agency did not begin operations until the latter part of 1980 and has a DCFS contract calling for treatment of 35-40 cases per year. Its staff consists of a single full-time therapist and four \"ob\u00ad servers,1I who go into clients' homes and record notes about fam- ily members' behavior. One of the founders of the agency, psychologist Charles C. Anderson, said he felt that the program was unique in Illinois. He characterized his approach as behavioral family, treatment and said that CPS in particular had became interested in his treat-, ment plans. In treating an abused or neglected child, the agency _, focuses on all of the family members, Anderson said. P-.nderson explained the p'rocedure used by the agency when a, referral is made by DCFS. HIS staff conduct an initial interview from two to four hours long to gather specific behavioral i~for\u00ad mation on the family. One of the purposes of this initial inter\u00ad view is to screen out psychotic families, as well as~farnilies whose members may require long~term placement. If the family is accepted for treatment, HIS staff meet with the referring DCFS worker to confer. HIS observers will begin noting behavior in the horne to provide a \"baseline\" for comparison when therapy be\u00ad gins. Later in the process, the observers will collect specific information determined by the treatment plan for each individual family. The observers arrive at the homes ,on pre-arranged sched\u00ad ules, when they know that family members will be present. They remain neutral during family interactions and will not intervene in any way ,,,hile observing. These observation periods each last from one-half to two hours. -318- j Anderson emphasized that the purpose of his program was to actually change behavior. Therapy sessions with family members, and separate sessions with the parents alone, are intended to in\u00ad troduce proper behavioral objectives to clients, based on what has been observed about their behavior in the horne. He added that the in-home observers ar~ frequently cross-checked by other ob\u00ad servers to en.sure reliability of the information being collected. Rating discrepancies are analyzed carefully and resolved. Anderson mentioned that' his observers might arrive at the horne very early in the morning, when everyone was getting up. Or they might arrive very late at niClht:.!. We asked him if these types of visits did not pose probli::tms with families because of lack of privacy_ In response, he said that we would be surprised at the acceptance the observers achieve after the initial sessions are completed. He maintained that observers are treated like pieces of furniture and are completely in the background. We asked Anderson if he felt that some family members might not act differently when the obs(~rvers were in the home--would they not put on their best behav;i.or for those occasions? Anderson responded that such is not the case . He said that research will bear this out. Anderson uses videotapes as training aids for clients who lack parenting skills. He said that some parents with no concep\u00ad tion of how to interact suddenly get the idea when they view a videotape of a family interacting properly. He said that such aids were also very useful with clients who had trouble reading and writing. Anderson said that treatment through HIS ceases when the tar\u00ad geted undesirable behaviors have decre~sed to the point that ~he family can live together in harmony. If treatment goals rema~n unmet, HIS staff makes recommendations to DCFS for alternative treatment. Anderson said that an \"unsatisfactory discharge II is ,., made when there is an indication that there might be violence to observers or the therapist; when parent or child psychosis is re\u00ad ve~led; and when a parent is deemed to require a psychiatric hos\u00ad pitalization. Anderson also told us that HIS provides aftercare for clients and other follow-up. After behavior levels are reached that are satisfactory to HIS , .. an HIS pbserver will visit the family at monthly intervals for six months. Then, every other month for the follow\u00ad ing year, an observer will visit the horne to be.certain that ~h~ level of behavioral change matches those prescr~bed by the or~g~- nal treatment plan. Anderson subscribes to the theory that child abusers were themselves abused as children, and he says that his program breaks the cycle of ch;i.ld abuse both by showing parents behavioral change, and by instilling in their children a new set of learned skills. -319-Such has been the popularity of his agency's treatment plan, according to Anderson, that cas'es are taken selectively and only from the northern portion of Cook County. Anderson characterized his relationship with DCFS as very good. His only complaint had to do with billings and slow reimbursement. E. Catholic Charities Commission investigators, pursuing a specific case study, interviewed Jadonal E. Ford, the ASsistant Director for the Divi\u00ad sion of Foster Care Seryices. He provided us with basic background information on Catholic Charities. Catholic Charities has had contracts with DCFS since the Depart\u00adment's inception. Early services were exclusively for regular foster care placements. In 1971, Catholic Charities added child protective services and has since been on contract with-DCFS to provide such services. At the time of our interview (May, 1'980), regular foster care services handled about 700 children annually, while the agency's own child protective services unit served about 600 children annually. Services provided ranged from emergency placement, which averaged six weeks, to regular foster care, which lasted anywhere from a year to several years. Ford told us that the Catholic Charities child protective service uni'!: was divided into three sub-divisions. The first, Protective Services, investigates minor allegations of abuse'or neglect that are referred from DCFS. These investigations are all initiated wi thin 24 hours of receipt, ac,cording to Ford. The second sub-division j.s Emergency Protective Services, whose major function is to place children removed from the home in order to protect them from potential harm. The third unit is In-Home Pro-. tective Services, a program devised to provide services for abuseg, or neglected children wno are to remain in the home. All of thes~ services were described as being significantly different from the~ types of services designed in \"regular\" foster care planning. Ford said that in regular foster placement, social workers from DCFS will have developed a long-range plan for .a child be\u00ad fore referring him to Catholic Charities for service. Catholic Charities only has to place a child in a home that would fit the requirements of the DCFS plan. Regarding emergency placements, workers from Catholic Charities will evaluate each case and de\u00ad velop a long-range plan for the best interests of the child. As an example, Ford said that workers might suggest adoption, or counseling, or continued foster care, or return of a child to the home. Ford offered the following \"idealJl scenario: DCFS would re\u00ad ceive an allegation of abuse or neglect and refer the case to Catholic Charities. Catholic Charities would invest~gate the case and develop a temporary p.lan which would be sent back to DCFS \" for review via a Catholic Charities liaison worker. DCE,S would .be able to approve the plan or suggest changes or modificatio,ns. In Six months, the case would b~ reviewed for effectiveness . -320;\" I ever in actuality, only workers from , DCFS, North and west area ~~;ices'have made personal visits to reVlew ~lac~ments'F~~~d said.

JSPA consisted of seven separate agencies, each of which may hdV~ had different components: 'I -321- I. Children's Home and Aid society of Illinois--Drexel Place Maryville Academy Methodist Youth Service Lutheran Social Services of Illinois--Edison Park Lakebluff-Applewood Homes for Children Allendale Mary Bartleme Homes In addition JSPA coordinated auxiliary services such as counsel\u00ad ing, tutori~g, and \"child care supervision.\" Zapotocny said that all JSPA referrals came from DCFS and that DCFS had a specific liaison person who identified \"eroblem children\" for referral to JSPA. A Comnlission investigator commented to Zapotocny tha~ he d~d not see what JSPA was doing that DCFS could not do. The ~nvest~\u00ad gator said that the JSPA administration appeared.to be a s,?rt of clearing house for placements of children to private agenc~es ~l-_ ready under contract to BCFS. Zapotocny responded that the ph~loso phy behind JSPA was to provide a \"servi~e uni.t\"' th~t would central\u00ad ize services provided by these seven pr~vate agenc~es. Zapotocny also maintained that JSPA could serve children better ~ecause the central administration of t.he agency provided four soc.~al workers for assessment of referred children, and that at the timeoo~ our interview, these four workers had a total ~aseload of 55 ch~ldren. Obviously, he said, they could provide more attention to ch~ldr~n because of this low caseload level. we also analyzed fiscal information for FY 81.

JSPA closed in 1981. G. Volunteers of America Foster Care Proqrams In February, 1982, we interviewed Gwendolyn Marshall, Director of Foster Care Programs for the Volunteers of Arrlerica (VOA). She told us that the VOA was chartered in Illinois in 1911 and has been affiliated with the National Volunteers of America. The VOAls activities have centered on providing professional services to troubled, disadvantaged children, with an emphasis on reSidential care and \"counseling~ In Chicago, the VOA has a staff of 45-50 full-time professionals operating out of five city locations. In FY 81, the VOA had an operating budget of $1.5 million. Marshall said that care is provided free of charge to clients and that the VOA relies on a combination of public and private funding. She said that most referrals are from state agencies. In FY 81, the foster care program comprised 47% of the VOAls Chicago-area budget and was funded in the amount of $707,724. Marshall told us that she had worked for DCFS herself once and did not want to criticize the agency. But she said she felt that any agency the size of DCFS would naturally experience prob\u00ad lems that would have to be corrected. She felt that the huge size of the agency. and its bureaucratic organization had caused some o~ its problems. She said she also felt that DCFS was not get\u00ad t~ng through to the very people it had to help--the lower-income people who would not attend counseling sessions of their own voli\u00ad tion but who needed some help in attending, or who needed such services to be provided in their own homes. . Mars~all recommended that DCFS focus on getting the very young ch~ldren ~n the DCFS system out of the system as soon as possible. These children should be either returned to a stabilized home or placed for adoption. She noted that once a child has become a teenager, no one wants to deal with him or her. Not only ~hat, but the long\u20ac!r a child is in the system, said Marshall, the harder the child will be to dea,l with. She observed that children kept in the system for long periods of time become bitter and attempt to \"get even\" for what has happened to them. To \u00b7the teenager, it is a situation of \"us against the world,\" an attitude very dif- ficult to combat. \\ .... ) H. ASSOCiates in Crisis Therapy .. We met with Anne Brown. Director of Associates in Crisis Therapy (ACT), on several separate occasions. In September of 1980, we !:ipoke with her. about sexual abuse of children in Evanston, where her offices are located. Brown told us that ACT had two contracts 'with DCFS, one for intake diagnosis with the Child Wel\u00ad fare Division, and the other for \"consultation therapy\" with the North Area Office in Chicago. Brown commented that the vast ma\u00ad jority of her DCFS clients are referred for reasons other than sexual abuse; however, at times sexual abuse surfaces as the real reqson behind other more obvious problems. She commented thCl.t -323-\\ I ~--- ------~---------- ....... , ._------------------------ because no one, in\u00ad cluding DCFS caseworkers, has asked the child what the problem really is. In addition to the two DCFS contracts, ACT has a private prac\u00adtice serving mostly adult women who have been sexually abused as children. . During this conversation, Brown referred to several problems she had been having with DCFS. She told us she had been having some difficulties with a particular CPS worker, who was involved, along with Brown, in a case cori-;:::erning a 13-year-old girl who had become pregnant by her own fathlar. Brown l~arned that the girl was still in her father's home ii:;ven though the CPS worker had pro\u00ad mised to have her placed. When Brown asked the CPS worker what had happened to the court referral she had planned to make, the CPS worker said that the father had told her that he \"wouldn't do it again,\" so the girl was left in the home. In March of 1981, Commission staff spoke with Brown again at her office. At this time, she said she felt that DCFS would be a more effective agency if it could establish an actual work- ing plan of operation. DCFS operates on what Brown characterized as a \"crisis mentality\" and is constantly in chaos. She said that DCFS is not mandated to provide primary prevention, but nevertheless should. DCFS at times has attempted to provide all types of care but usually care is rendered on an as-needed basis, she said. Brown also said it is essential that caseworkers get to know the police, hospital personnel, officials from other state agen\u00ad cies in th~ area, staff from other private agencies, and citizen volunteers. When we asked if it were feasible to divide the state into areas smq,ll enough so that all of these profeSSionals could get to know one another and work together, she said that it was possible and could easily be done in, for example, Chicago's North Area. I. Youth Services Bureau In September, 1980, we spoke with William H. Young, Director of Youth Services Bureau (YSB) in Marion, Illinois. Young, a for\u00ad mer employee of DCFS, had been with YSB in Marion for five years at the time of our interview. He told us that the YSB was an out\u00ad reach program designed to help children before they end up in court or in foster placement. He said that they\" do not offer 24-hour supervision or any permanent living arrangements, such as'gr9uP homes. The Bureau's primary focus lies in fiv~ areas: big brother/ big sister placement; peer counseling; counseling status of\u00ad counseling ~for pregnant girls; ana \"stress chal- ~ lenge,\" consisting of, outdoor activities designed to break down a child's psychological barriers. Young added-that YSB used to do a good deal of court diversion work, but the program has been considerably cut down rf-cently because the agency has not been able to secure funding for the program. -324-, . I J The agency's eight professionals provide services to an aver\u00ad age of 130 _phildren a day, Young estimated. YSB has.two offices, in Marion and Benton, Illinois, and serves two count~es. At the time of our interview, YSB spent apout six months with each chil~ referred; Young said that this would.soon c~ange so that e~ch ch~~d would receive more intensive counsel~ng dur~ng a shorter t2me per~od, probably 10 weeks. Most of the children referred to YSB had problems in school, were runaways, had become pregnant, or were beyond the control of their parents. Young said that mo~t. referrals came. from DCFS,. schools, the police, mental health cl~n~cs (although h~s agency. does not serve children with severe mental problems), other s~c~al service agencies, parents, and childre~ themse~ves. Yo~ng sa~d that service plan is established w1th a\u00b7ch11d and h~? p~rents and will vary in each case. The primary method for resolut;:~on of difficulties, however, is counseling of one type or another. Young commented that within the two years previ~us to ou: interview DCFS had become more efficient and effect~ve. Dur~ng the six m~nths immediately prior to our interview, though, he felt that the Department again appeared to be ~n.a state of ~lU:C' He said that the Department could never stab~l~ze because ~t was con\u00ad stantly in a stat!= of reorganization. Young also.commented that he felt DCFS had allowed too many children to \"sl~de through.the cracks\" in the system. He said that now that DCFS was f~cus~ng on abused and neglected children, adolescent and MINS ch~ldren were being ignored. He said he felt that foster and group care placements for these older children were inadequate. Young told us that part of DCFS' problem was ,?onstant a(~jl~tr:~s\u00ad trative change and too great a ~ureaucr~cy. He sa~~ he al:o fl:J.'t. that the Department was caught ~n the m~ddle of an ~deol~g7cal/ battle among its staff over providing casework or sup7rv~~~ng cca:e management, with the result that neither of the funct70n~ was be~ng developed properly. He felt that the idea of DCFS ex~st~ng as solely a monitoring agency was fine, but t~at, either wa~, some\u00ad one had to decide how to resolve the conf11ct. Young sa1d pro\u00ad vision of casework and case management at the same time were too time-consuming and inefficient. Young also commented on DCFS' relationship with cont;.-act':lal\" agencies, the thrust of this chapter. He felt t;:hat DCFS bur~ed . its caseworkers in paperwork and red tape as a result of poor mon1- toring functions. Young said he fel~ that DCF~ should place greater trust in\" its contractors. H1S content~on was that DCFS monitoring was Simply duplication of the wor,k already done by the contracting agency. He said that he felt that DCFS paperwork done to\u00b7verify papeC~~ork done by the contractual agency was a waste of ;time. Y'oung compared DCFS' system with similar account~bility Mental ijealth. Youngsa~d thatre\u00ad ferrals from DMH were nowhere near as complicated as those from DCFS. paperwork for DMH was 110t duplicative, he said~, -325--~--~------- -- --- Regarding general program operations of DCI?S, Young said that he was a proponent of decentralizing the regions so that each could b~ more sensitive to the individual needs of its own area, rather tIlan have to be sensitive to the needs of people in Springfield. ~e suggested that the central offices in Springfield establish, general rules and guidelines and then allow local regions to operate without so many \"restrictions and red tape.\" At the time of our interview, Young was a member of a special committee established by the Governor to deal with placement of hard-to-place children. His committee work had shown him the numer\u00ad ous criticisms voiced by others regarding the operation of DCFS. While he had heard many criticis.ms, he said he had heard very few suggestions for yhange. J. Rosecrance Memorial Homes for Children The Commission was primarily interested in the major tial facility operated as part of the Rosecrance Memorial for Children: the Rockford Campus. Rosecrance also runs campus\" facility in Durand, Illinois. residen\u00ad Homes a \"rural Commission staff visited both facilities. We spoke in Rockford with Phillip Eaton, Director, and Ronald Allen, Program Director. The interView lasted several hours and was followed by\" a tour of the facility. Eaton and Allen told us that the facility's therapy program involved \"positive peer culture~\" requiring a staff with extensive train.ing and specific types of education. Incoming staff are ex\u00ad pected to ~old master'S degrees in social work or a related field. In addition, they have to undergo 40 hours of classroom training in the type of therapy provided at Rosecrance. The training is followed by/two written examinations. Trainees are evaillated fairly rigorous ly jJ . II .,' Client referrals corne primarily through t~b sources, DCFS and the courts. Rosecrance allows staff to ac;:c'ept 2% total popu\u00ad lation private placements, but we were told that such private placements are quite rare. The facility at Rockford was designed < for women only and h~s a capacity of 40; the facility at Durand was designed entirely for males, and has a capacity of 60. Most of the clients are between the ages of 13 and 16. When a client is referred, staff review appropriate documents relative to the client and conduct pre .... placement interviews with appropriate.par\u00adties. In some cases, this will include only the clientcand her caseworker. In other cases, it might include the client, a case\u00ad worker, parents, other state agency workers, and posSibly private workers, also. Depending on the outcome of the interview, a client is q.ccepted or rej ected. . .' We \\.,ere told that the therapy at Rosecrance is very demand\u00ad ing and that clients must be active participant,s or fail and be transferred out. Eatontold us that clients who are suiCidal, homicidal, pregnant, or addicted to drugs or \u00b7alcohol will not be accepted. -326-When a client is selected, she and her parents are told.that there will be no hom~ visits until the girl is ready to r~t~rn home ; parents , however, are encouraged to visit weekly. \\CLLents are told not: to bring radiosf televisions, or other personal items because staff wants to discourage the clients from becoming too comfortable. Clients are divided into groups of ten, each group with a staff leader. The group is re\u00b7spons ible for making rules and en\u00ad forcing them. The only basic rule for the entire Rosecrance faci\u00adlity, we learned, is that no person may engage in \"hurting behavior\" either to themselves or to others. Each of these groups estab- ' lishes a separate identity, has a name, and is allowed to utilize a specific part of the campus for themselves. Schooling is mandatory--there are no exceptions. School is conducted on the campus itself and each student has the indivi\u00ad dual responsibility to attend and, according to Eaton, to do well. The grouJ? is responsible for seeing that each member fulfills her educational responsibility. Credits are given through the local school system in Rockford for work completed successfully. In addition to schooling, work is mandatory for all clients. Each group establishes its own work assignments, rules, and stand\u00ad ards within each living unit. Eaton considered these assignments an integral part of therapy. Because the emphasis of therapy is on clients learning and accepting responsibility fox their ac,tions and lives, group leaders do not intervene or interfere with clients unless \"hurting behavior\" with which the group cannot deal occurs. Eaton and Allen told us that continuity in the program is maintained through regular staff meetings and maintenance of a daily log on every client. All staff are trained in filling out these logs. Eato~ and Allen said that basically, therapy involves clients' learning to confront the difficulties in their lives and in others' lives, discovering appropriate solutions to the difficulties, and imp1~~menting solutions. The actual vehicle for this evolutionary process is a daily group meeting at which problems are raised and confronted and during which solutions are suggested. When a child feels that she ;'5 ready to go home, she will ask the entire group for a reCOIlunendation to \"that effect. If the group agrees, the'n the group leader ,will cons ider the request. If he or she agrees, then supervisory staff will determine whether a child should be sent hom~~, Eaton and Allen told us that the groups deal with problems d\u00a3 all times, and that when a problem arises normal work stops until it can be resolved. About 50% of t~e parents are active participants in their child's therapy. The Rosecrance philosophy is that parents are and should be responsible for their children. Each Sunday, par\u00ad ents are requested to visit if they ,can. Time is 'set aside for meetings with staff; also, parents have anopport.unity each week -327-~...-------------!2 ai; 4# to meet with their child alone. In addition, the~3 is a meeting held during the week, ea.ch week; for parents to. identify and solve problems that impinge on their children's behav~or. Parents are allowed to review the daily log and any other records that concern their child. They\u00b7are invited to all staffings and to 90-day con\u00ad ferences involving their children. Eaton told us that Rosecrance would like to initiate an after\u00ad care program for clients and t~eir paren~s: ~owever, the~e s DCFS contrac~, Rosecrance could not afford such a formal program. Eaton sa~d that staff does provide informal assistance to families who re\u00ad quest it. Eaton also told us that, generally, Rosecrance enjoys good relations with other agencies, including DCFS~ .However, Eator: and Allen did mention some problems that had arlsen. They sa~d that the quality of DCFS workers varies considerably; .th~se who visit and participate in staffings are generally cons~dered to be very good. Those who fail to communicate with Ros~crance staff or the referred child and who do not show up at stafflngs ~re . generally considered to be poor. They added that a worker s f~~l: ing to show up at important meetings can adversely affect a ~h~ld s treatment because the child, according to Eaton and Allen~ r~ghtly interprets lack of interest on the part of the wO::ke~ as JU:,t~ that-\u00ad lack of interest. This can deal a blow to the ch~ld s self \u20accteem, development of which is one of the key elements of the Rosecrance program. Rosecrance had developed the policy of informing the Juven\u00ad ile Court every 90 days regarding a child's progress; this report to the court would include a notation on whether the DCFS worker had been an active participant in the period being covered. Eatqn said that this policy had caused some dissension, on the part of .1 DCFS, but it had also produced action. We briefly discussed reimbursement rates ~ith Eaton and Allen. They said that DCFS provided $40 per day per cl~ent; actual cost of care was estimated to be $47 per day. They said that they could provide services 'for this low figure because group leaders are not paid very much and because there are no medical personnel, such as psychip.trists, involved in the progr~m. We were told that the program is successful with 65-70% of the clients referred, for the following five reasons: a. b. c. Use of one consistent therap~utic approach in which all staff contacting the client are trained. continu~l application of the therapy in all situations o Dedicated and trained personnel. c d. ~n adequate physical facility for programs. e. Parental involvement in all phases of the program. -328-l. Shortly after this viSit, Commission staff went to the Durand Ca~pus of Ros~cran~e to inspect the facility and interview Kurt Fr~edenauer, ~ts d~rector.~ He told us that the agency requires that its employees hold Bachelor's degrees in order to be hired All staff receive the same training in Rosecrance's \"positive p~er culture\" therapy as is required at the Rockford facility. Friedenauer told us that all referrals come through the courts and DCFS. He added that if they did not have to take referrals fr~m DCFS, they would not do so. He offered these two reasons: ch~ldren are seldom referred because Rosecrance therapy fits their needs, .but rather because caseworkers need to place children some\u00ad where ~n the state (often, he said, referrals come on mimeographed forms that obviously have been submitted to other placements Simul\u00ad taneously); and most of the children placed with Rosecrance have had multiple placement failures in the past. Few have the sorts 01\"'1 family ties that f~,t in with Rosecrance' s family therapy philo-sophy. \\ 'I (\\ Although the Durand facility was designed to serve males it had a coeducational program in operation. At the time of ~ur in~erview, the.facility had four male groups and one female group. Fr~edenauer sa~d that he would like more balance with groups--more girls' groups. Each of the groups had about ten members and each had a group leader. As at Rockford, rules are established by the groups, and both school and work are mandatory. One difference is that the Durand school is not accredited although students can transfer their credits to any local sch~OI in the state upon graduation from Durand. Work programs are also more extensive than in Rockford. Again, however, group meetings are established to resolve ~if~icultie~. Progress is recorded in daily logs and through per~ ~od~c staff~ngs . ~arents are invited to attend meetings and staff\u00ad ~ngs and to part~c~pate in therapy as much as possible. Friedenauer said that few, if any, DCFS staff from outside of.his geographical region have ever come to the campus for any\u00ad th~ng other than to make the initial referrral. He added that the~a~y for.children ref~rred by these workers was interrupted by th~s att~tude of non-~nvolvement. Friedenauer said that the relationship between Durand staff, the local courts and the local DCFS office was very good. The Durand staff also s~bmits 90-day reports to the courts, which, Friedenauer said, sometimes angers DCFS workers, because the court learns whether they have made any attempt to be involved with the children at Durand. Friedenauer reported that one major area of friction between DCFS staff and his own st~ff was the very purpose of the facility. He said that Durand prepared clients to function on the outside and to be independent, while often DCFS had referred children as ,part of a treat),lent plan ,that included referral to still another program or fa~lity upon graduation. . . -329----------------------.--,~-------.--~.~-----,------~----~~ .... -------------~--- The Durand campus is reimbursed $30.72 per day per child by the Department. Friedenauer estimated actual costs to be $10-$12 more per day. According to Friedenauer, he has been told that Durand can increase its reimbursement rate by pt:lrchasing expensive automobiles and equipment, and by uti'lizing more medical personnel, such as psychiatrists. Friedenauer said that none of this was necessary but still was frustrated with having to run his program on such a low budget, In July of 1981, the Commission received from DCFS fiscal information concerning the Rosecrance home.s. The licensed capacity for the Rockford campus was 30, and 60 for Durand. None of the cost.s incurred by either campus was considered excessive. The per diem rate for the Rockford campus was $39.54 for FY 81, while the per diem rate for the campus at Durand was $30.79. This compares with an average per diem for the Mary Bartelme Homes of $64.07. The Rosecrance facilities had been allowed the maxi\u00ad mum DCFS increases in FY 81 (12.5%), but even with the maximum increase, Rosecrance's rates remained low. Actual costs of care at Rosecrance apparently were not reimbursed by DCFS. The Rosecrance Memorial Homes for Children appeared to our investigators to be a well-run program that was fully accountable to parents, DCFS, and the courts. Problems with the programs are primarily attributable to DCFS caseworker diffidence and reluc\u00ad tance. K. Maryville Academy Commission investigators viSited Maryville Academy, a resi\u00ad dential facility with many DCFS clients, on several occasions, both to discuss details of individual case studies and to develop' information about the facility in general. I ,\\ Maryville Academy is in Des Plaines and consists of a 75-acre campus, including cottages that serve as group homes for most of Maryville's reSidents. D/.lring our vi.sit, we talked 'with various administrators, including Father John P.

Sinpe taking over as\u00b7Executive Director, he has added a diagnostic center, shel\u00ad ter care and, most recently, a Family-Teacher Program.

We followed cases involving several girls -332-I ' .. \". staying at one of the homes operated by the Bartelme Homes sys\u00ad tem. We will recount interesting and pertinent observations from our interviews, chronologically, so that the reader can understand what lead us to continue to look into the Bartelme Homes' system. In May of 1980, Commission investigators interviewed Alton M. Broten, Executive Director of the Mary Bartelme Homes. The Bartelme Homes themselves were opened in 1914 by Juvenile Court J,udge Mary Bartelme. Originally, the purpose of the homes was to provide residential treatment for adolescent girls with prob\u00ad lems. As the Homes grew and developed, additional services were added, such as group therapy and psychological and psychiatric counseling. In its early years, the Homes operated three group home cen\u00ad ters. The girls attended public school and lived under the super\u00ad vision of group home parent/supervisors. Broten became Executive Director in 1961. When he took over, 'the system operated only two homes, with a total capacity of eighteen girls. One of the .homes was located on Lakewood Street, the other on Wellington Street, both in Chicago. Throughout the 1960's, 60% of the referrals were from the Juvenile Court~ Thirty-five percent of the placements came from the Illinois Department of Public Aid. The remainder came as pri\u00ad vate placements. DCFS was not involved until 1965 because it did not exist prior to that time; Public Aid handled many of its duties previously. Today, Mary Bartelme Homes receives almost 100% of its re\u00ad ferrals from DCFS. Sixty-one girls are in regular group home place\u00ad ment in eight separate facilities; 75 girls are served through an independent living contract with DCFS. In addition to the eight \"regular ll group homes, two additional facilities provide service to severely troubled,~dolescent girls. Broten said that these homes require double staff. These homes are the Essex Group Home and the Dover Group Home. At the time of our interview, the chil\u00ad dren living at Dover were all DCFS referrals. Those at Essex were referred by JSPA while it was still in existence. When JSPA folded, contracts for the home were assumed by DCFS. Broten said that Bartelme programs are only reimbursed for about 75% of their expenses. He said that the Department sets limits on expenditures and will not allow some costs at all. Broten felt that DCFS was better in reimbursing than some agencies, but he felt that it had not peell altogether reasonable in its reimburse- ment formulae and rates.' t Broten told us that the majority of girls served by his agency have at one time or another been victims of abuse or neglect. This was 'particularly true, he said, of girls 15, 16, and 17. Some girls referred had been severely abused~as inf~nts and had been in o~her placements as they grew up. Broten said that counseling in his agency's system was designed to address any and all prob- lems that a girl might have~ -333\"'!\" au '4 4# ! \\ , Broten criticized the information sent to the. agency in a referral form, sayng it was inadequate. The standard referral form can become \"erratic,\" he said, depending on how individual workers decide to fill it out. Broten said he felt that these problems were improving at the time of this interview. Broten said he was very upset that the Department wanted to terminate girls in the independent living program at the age of 18. He said the Department's position was that most of the girls 18 and over just wanted money t9 live and that such cases should be transferred to the Department of Public Aid. Broten provided us With fiscal history. In 1978-79, the agen\u00ad cyis total income was $2,209,361, of which $1,923,871 was provided by DCFS. Expenses for the same period were divided as follows: Group Home Program ~ $1,382,339 Independent Living Program $ 445,656 Information Clearinghouse $ 15,133 CETA Program Services $ 21,961 Management and General $ 306,069 Fund Raising ~ $ 17,574 In general, Broten felt that DCFS had been fiscally respon- \" sible to the Bartelme Homes. He mentioned a backlog in reimburse~ ments but ascribed them to minor technical deficiencies. He felt that any problems come at the caseworker level, with workers who fail to properly file the right documents that will provide reim\u00ad bursements. These caseworker delays had caused the Bartelme Homes to be 3-4 months late in receiving payment in some cases, Broten said. I Broten told us that the Bartelme Homes receives \u00b7referrals from all four area offices in Chicago and on occasj,on \"from an of\u00ad fice in Aurora. Broten said that all contracts are for one year, at which time negotiations and revisions occur regarding a new cqntract. The Bartelme Homes employs parents and 25 social workers. ports, an organizational chart, of the Bartelme Homes. 120 people, including 65 house Broten gave us recent annual re\u00ad and-a sheet of photographs of nine Commission investigators first met with Mary Bartelme staff to develop social history information on some of its resident3 in July, 1980. We followed up on several of the cases, including one involving a girl referred to DCFS on a Minor in Need of Super\u00ad vision (MINS) petition. Conunission investigators intervieTfled Mary Beth Meyer and Susan Caravel;Lo at the Wellington ,House. Meyer was .. Director of Wellington House and Caravello was acounseloi for the Bartelme program.

Meyer said that many of the girls at the Wellington House had been abuse victims, but not in adolescence; she ad~ed that most of the girls had gone through multiple placements before coming to the Wellington House. Meyer said that the facility operated on the basis that most girls re\u00ad ferred would remain at the home for a fairly long period of time. The program is geared toward directing a girl toward independent living, not toward return of the girl to her home. Meyer said that the girls are expected to go to school, but they do not always go. Bartelme Homes has its own school, she said, staffed by Board of Education employees. Many Welli:.lqton House residents could not attend Public schools, she said, because of their behavioral problems. Meyer said that most of the girls have their afternoons and evenings free if they attend school. At the time of our interview, only one of the girls in the home was trying to find a job. Meyer said that girls are expected to spend their nights at the home, but that they do not always do so. Girls are expected to sign out and indicate where they are going when they leave, but they do not always do so. Each is re\u00ad sponsible for cooking one night a week and must keep her room neat. Meyer furnished us with a copy of the rules promulgated for the Wellington House; we noted that often these rules are not followed. By Meyer's own admission, some of the rules are not enforceable. Besides Meyer and Caravello, there were six full-time child care workers for the home. These workers were required to have high school diplomas and be at least 21; they provided \"on-the\u00ad spot counseling\" for the girls in the home. The base salary for these workers was $540 per month. Meyer said that DCFS workers are involved only as much as they want to be. She said that some workers want to monitor cases and others are uninterested. In all cases, contact is initiated by the Wellington House worker or by the girl. Meyer criticized DCFS for continual reorganizations; for a lack of uniformity in area offices; for continual reassignments for girls (preventing them from establishing relationships with workers); for referrals coming in without a ~aseworker to speak with; and for poor DCFS case histories with which Meyer and her staff have had to work. Meyer told our investigators that there was an acute problem with two girls in the home prostituting themselves. Meyer blamed the problem in part on the location of the home. The two girls involved with prostitution were 14 and 17 and both were involved with pimps. Meyer commented that she was working with vice of\u00ad ficers of the Chicago Police Department to try to do something about the two girls' behavior. She added that one of the girls probably would be placed at the Rosecrance facility in Rockford. Meyer told us that her philosophy at the Wellington House was to give girls latitude to do as they wanted; to try to change the girls by forcing them to do something would not work. She felt that the girls would change when they were ready for change. -337-a 4 j ; ,# She endea. the interview by saying, \"We try not to give kids the impression that they can do anything they want--we try to give them the impression that certain things aren't approved of and hope this tool is effective.\" Next Meyer explained the backgrounds of the six child care workers at the Wellington House, during which time Edwin Be, As\u00ad sistant Executive Director, joined the interview. He explained the classification system designed for differentiation between Child Care Worker divisions (I through III), each reflecting a diff,erence in salary. Meyer told us that training occurs on-the-job and through an eight-week, 32-hour course conducted by Mary Bartelme staff. Meyer described a typical day at the Wellington House as school for most of the girls, a free afternoon, and designated evening activities several times a'week, including bingo every Tuesday night. When asked about counseling, Meyer responded that she meets individually with each girl once a week for about 45 minutes. However, she added that professional counseling may be provided through contract with Dr. Maurice Kaplan, a counselor for Bartelme Homes for 'C the past ten years. She said 'that he provides initial , assessments on the girls and general consultation for staff. Meyer . said that, if necessary, Ridgeway Hospital was available for psy\u00ad chiatric crisis intervention. FinaFly, she said that group coun- j seling is conducted by each house director; at Wellington House, Meyei provided the group counseling \"generally\" each Thursday af\u00ad ternoon. Meyer admitted that it was difficult to get all the girls ~' together for these sessions, however. We also asked Meyer about goals for residents of the Welling\u00ad ton House. Outcome goals, she said, were established at intake by DCFS caseworkers and Mary Bartelme staff in consultation with one another. Goals generally are established for \"direction, edu\u00ad cation, and vocational planning.\" According to M~yer, Kaplan does not participate in establishing goals for the girls' at intake \"be-\" cause he does not be'lieve in them. ,\" Meyer estimated that 90% of ' residents remain in placement until release to live independently. The younger girls might go home eventually, and older girls might be transferred to Bartelme's Supervised Independent Living Program. We compared these ,assessments with DCFS' Program Plan for the Mary Bartelme Homes Regular Group Home Program, which provides the following outcome goals: 1) At least 60% of its clients will be terminated with ade\u00ad quate planning leading to either: a. reunion with family or private family settirlg b. Q a state of self-sufficiency c. a satisfactory independent living arrangement -338-\\.: \" J d. or, an\\,:~}er agency setting 2) At lea~t 55% of all discharged clients will have reached the treatment goals established at admission. Ii 3) It will accept back into the program 80% of all runaways unless it has no vacancy. The program these goals and that no achieve its plan also includes this statement: recogntzing that these objectives penalties shall occur for failure outcome goals.\" Ii liThe agency sets are not universals of the agency to Meyer elaborated on several Wellington House rules She said that failure to attend school before a resident's 17th birthday could.result in discharge. Drugs or liquor brought into the home were to be confiscated and, in serious cases, given as evidence to the police. Meyer added that breach of the rules results in reduction of the weekly $6.10 allowance that each resident receives. Furthermore, the child care worker responsible for the particular girl Will confront her about her behavior and discuss the situa\u00ad tion. The allowance could be revoked or reduced. Meyer also said that the $6.10 figure was a base amount and that the girls could earn more, depending on their performance. When asked about problems at the Wellington House, Meyer re\u00ad sponded that the most frequent is curfew violation. She also re\u00ad ferred to several former Wellington House girls who had been prosti\u00ad tutes., She added that prostitution was handled by staff \"talking to the'girlll to try to make her understand the consequences of her actions. She als,o mentioned that the girls did not prosti- tute because they needed more money but for psychological reasons. Edwin Be explained the funding mechanisms for different com\u00ad ponents of the Bartelme system and also explained the system's structure. The least structured homes are those included in the Regular Group Home Program and the Gunnison and South Shore Homes, which are tranSitional group homes for girls 17 and over prepar\u00ad ing for independent living. He said that the regular group homes (Lakewood, Wellington, Jarvis, Touhy, Greenleaf, and Chase) are more structured than the two transitional homes. Furthermore, he added, the degree of structure in each home is largely deter\u00ad mined by each house's internal rules and by the residents in the homes. The next most structured home is the Dover House, which r7ceived more money per resident. Be described the home as a spe\u00ad c~al care group home for difficult girls. Eight child care work\u00ad ers were assigned to the home. The most highly structured home is Essex House, which received in 1980 $104 per diem per girl. The staff at Essex House proVided supervision for the girls all the time. When informed that some DCFS caseworkers had complained that Bartelme residents are sometimes transferred from one h6me to another without notification to DCFS, Meyer said that she considers such transfers temporary and not subject to notification. She called such transfers IItime-outsll for girls to move to another -339-pa-4; , 4# ---~ ....... ~---------.--.--------------~--~-~~- ~--- home briefly if they cannot resolve specific difficulties in one setting. Be added that the Bartelme administration considers all of the girls in the homes to be \"one family\" and that it is not a problem when a girl is transferred from one home to another. Be added that when a girl changes homes to move to a different program, DCFS definitely will be notified, because there will be a change in per diem rates. Meyer provided us with a list of residents placed at Wellington House from January 1, 1980, to September 10, 1980. Of seventeen girls placed, four remained in the program, four were transferred to the Bartelme Independent Living Program, four ran away, an<;l five were \"administratively discharged.\" In November, investigators spoke with officials of the Mary Bartelme Homes educational facility, the John V. Sandberg School in Chicago. We spoke with Michael Catania, Principal, and James Scherrer, Director of Residence for the Bartelme Homes and liai\u00ad son to the school. We learned that the Sandberg School is one-of-a-kind in the city of Chicago; it serves only those individuals that are par~ of the Mary Bartelme Homes system. Basically, the school prov~des special education for high-school-age girls o The program does not differ significantly from that offered in city schools; the big difference is in environment, according to Catania. Students' are not affected by the pressures of public school and may be able to learn more. Also, Catania said, the school's teachers are able to provide far more personal attention to the needs of students at Sandberg School. Catania said that most of the students at the school have severe learning and behavioral disorders--sometimes both. When students graduate from the Sandberg School, they are enrolled in a special education program at a regular h~gh school. The ultimately successful student is the one who can graduate from a regular high school program. Catania said that students' progress is assessed in quarterly meetings, to which appropriate Mary Bartelme staff and DCFS work\u00ad ers are invited. Catania characterized DCFS response as erratic. Some caseworkers were very ~onscientious about following up on children referred to the Bartelme Homes; others did not seem to care. We were told that the teachers at the Sandberg School are both supplied by and paid by the Chicago Board of Education. They all have master's degrees and are state-certified to teach ,spe\u00ad cial education at the high school level. Catania told us that the school employed three teachers, a teacher's aide, and one \"sup\u00ad portive service teacher.\" The only cost to the Mary Bartelme agency is for maintenance of the building. Meals are provided by the Chicago Board of Education as part of its normal school lunch pro\u00ad gram. -340-~ , I I I \" \" We were told that the av~rage length of stay for a girl was a year to a year and a half. We were also told that attendance at the school was mandatory, with transportation for students liv\u00ad ing south of the Wellington House being provided by the school. Students living north of the Wellington House were expected to take public transportation to the school, for which they were given carfare. Though attendance; was characterized as mandatory I we were also told that attendance averages 55-56%. Absenteeism is supposed to be dealt with ~t each individual home by the child care workers. At Sandberg, excessive absenteeism is dealt with by giving a failing grade. Finally, Catania tdld us that 88% cf the girls in the Mary Bartelme system were in school: 50% in regular high school pro\u00ad grams and the other 38% ~t Sandberg. Half of the girls in regu\u00ad lar high school programs were in special education classes and programs. The other 12% of the girls were enrolled in some form of GED class or had jobs. Catania ended the interview by saying that Sandberg graduates had don~ exceptionally well in special education programs at regular high schools. ,On December 16, 1980, in the midst of our inquiry into the Bartelme Homes, Sandra O'Brien, a resident of Wellington House, was indicted together with a friend, Betty Hinckley, for murder, armed violence, armed robbery, and conspiracy to commit armed rob\u00ad bery in the killing of IBM executive Anthony J. Hopfner~ We examined a report to DCFS Meyer dated October 9, 1980, which sta\u00b7tes that 0' Brien's performance at Wellington HOUSe was not acceptable. Included in the report are the comments that \"Sandy does whatever she wants\" and \"needs a kick in the pants.\" As a result of O'Brien's behavior and this report, a contract was de\u00ad veloped to regulate O'Brien's behavior. The Commission received a copy of the contract developed specifically for O'Brien. The contract calls for the following: O'Brien will cook on her as\u00ad Signed days and will \"do her chore\" on Sat~rdays. Furthermore, \"Sandy will be in on time (11:30 on week nights, 1:00 a.m. on Fri\u00ad day and Saturday) at least 80% of the time (100% is expected; 80% would represent significant improvement).\" O'Brien was to con\u00ad tinue to let staff know where she was going when she left the home (as mentioned previously, it was standard procedure for girls to sign in a~~ out, indicating destination). O'Brien was expected to secure at least part-time employment and was to spend gt least five days per week looking for work until she found a job. Welling\u00ad ton House would provide transportation money. O'Brien was expected to submit written proof of her attempts to get a job. For self\u00ad improvement, O'Brien was expected to enroll in some sort of class of her choice and would()have to meet with Mary Beth Meyer once each week individually. We also reviewed ,an assessment. conducted on November 3, 1980, and submitted to DCFS on November 28. Present at this Periodic Service Review were O'prien, Meyer, and O'Brien's child care worker. O'Br:j,en had improved in. her cooking and chores. Out of 24 pos\u00ad sible nights, she had been late only once and out allonight three -341-\" a it 4$? times (\"significant improvement\"). She remained vague in letting ~he staff know her whereabouts. O'Brien had not yet found a job, nor has she demonstrate(j a d~termined effort to find one.\" O'Brien had made no effort to engage ~n any positive structured program (such a~ cl~sses) for self-improvement, nor had she demonstrated any mo~~vat~on to keep individual counseling appointments. Meyer's narrat~ve reports that while O'Brien's \"area of basic expectations\" had \":ra~tly im.t;>roved,\" she had not demonstrated the motivation or ab~l~ty to ~prove her life. She was warned that when she reached age 18, DCFS fU~ding might be cut off for her. Meyer adds, \"The workers were do~ng all the work, and felt quite frustrated by Sandi's apparent lack of interest fn areas affecting her life.\" Comm~ssi,?n staff pursued its study of the Mary Bartelme Homes by procur~ng ~nformation on the Essex House. This information cam~ ~rom th~ DCFS Cook County Licensing Unit. The Essex House fac~l~ty, wh~le part of the Mary BarteL~e system, also served adoles\u00ad cent~ referred by ~SP~. Its licensed capacity is six girls. Li\u00ad cens~ng documents ~nd~cate that the facility serves girls between 13 and 19 who require intensive care and treatment who are re\u00ad fe:-red by ~CFS, and w~o running away, fa~lure, ~nvolvement, prior psychiatric hospitalization mini\u00ad mally mentally retarded, etc.\" Girls who are suicidal psychotic seve:ely mentally retarded, or non-ambulatory generall~ are not ' cons~dered for admission to the facility. f The Essex House ~taffing plans call for two child care work\u00ad ers.to be on-call dur~ng each of the eight-hour shifts. The House's soc~al worker and residence counselor function as backup. One of the documents we reviewed was a list of twelve girls served by Essex House between September 1, 1978, and August 1, 1~79. The document includes a list of charges. Seven girls wer<l d-:-scharged from the home during this period: one to a mental hos~\" p~tali one to her mother's care; one to independent living. one to a~other compo~ent of the JSPA system; one back to the DCFS re~ ferr~ng area off~ce; and two to other group homes in the Mary Barteleme system. I~ Janua:y of 1981, we spoke at length with Tanya Kent, Di-\" r~c~or of Res~dences for both South Shore and Essex House faci\u00ad l~t~es. Among Kent's duties were assuring compliance between wards Bart~lme.agency's rules and regulatiops, making termination, submittingbi-annual progress re.t;>0rts to JSPA, and dealing with any serious problems that may ar~se. Under Kemt' s direction were two group home di\u00ad recto:s, two resident counselors, and 15 child care worker~. Kent was d~rectly answerable to Edwin Be. . Ke~t told ~s that the house directors spend about half of thel.r tl.me prov~ding counseling for wards under \"their care The o~her half of their time is generally spent on actual admi~istra\u00ad tl.on of ~he homes. ~he house week ~ndivi\u00ad dually Wl.th each res~dent, and in a group setting once a week. -342 .... ,. ~. I ! r k M \" i-l f.j Ii n 1 r t, I: r ~ f f. !' \\ Ii [J 1. I 1 ~A, ~ ri r J, ! I! ~ I I I t l J i I We were told that one \"unique element\" about the Essex House opera\u00ad tion was that counseling meetings with the house director were mandatory. Refusal to meet with the director is dealt with im\u00ad mediately, we were told. The objective of programs of the Essex House is to provide an atmosphere of understanding, one that will help residents deal with normal adolescent issues as well.as the particular problems that confront the girls. Most of the girls referred to the faci~ lity have displayed extreme disruptive behavior; therefore, in addition to providing instruction in normal adjustment to adoles\u00ad cent issues, the staff at the facility must deal with social ad\u00ad justments and mannerisms of the residents. All of the Essex House residents are involved in special education, either at the Sandberg School or in a regular high school program. Kent told us that at no time during the day will there be fewer than nine staff members present at the home. Girls are not free to come and go as they please; during the first 30 days of their stay they are not even allowed the right to be alone. Bed\u00ad rooms and ~ashroom facilities have no locks on their doors. If a girl wishes to leave the facility, she must earn the right to do so, and when she wishes to leave, she must provide documenta\u00ad tion regarding her destination, the time she will leave and.re\u00ad turn and what she will be doing when she is gone. Kent sal.d that girl~ are never allowed to leave without meeting these criteria. Regarding program success, Kent told us that when a girl moves from the highly structured Essex House to a less ~tructured set\u00ad ting, that girl would be considered to have exper~enced a good deal of success. We next interviewed several current and several former resi\u00ad dents of the Wellington House. Several alleged that residents were allowed to bring alcohol and marijuana into the Wellington House for personal use. One former resident admitted to enga~ing in prostitution for 5~ of the eight months that she had been l.n residence, and she alleged that five other girls in the home had been prostitutes while living at the Wellington House. Another former resident told us that there was no \"pressure\" f,?r a~y ,?f the residents to attend school. She said that the basl.c dl.scl.\u00ad plinary action was reduction in weekly allowance. She also to~d us that drugs were procured and hidden in bedrooms of the Welll.ng\u00ad ton House. The parents of one girl who had been placed at W~ll~ngton. House told us that they threatened DCFS with a lawsul.t ~f thel.r daughter were not transferred to another facility. She was moved to the Rockf'ord Campus of Rosecrance Memorial Homes for Children. The parents told us that they had been assured that, while.at Wellil1gton, their daughter would receive intensive counsell.ng and would be in a very structured setting. Her father told us that he sa\\,l his daughter \"hanging out\" with her old friends in Rogers Park only a week after the placement had been made. After that, her parents would see her often in early afternoon far.from Wel\u00ad lington House. It was ,.obvious that she was not attendl.ng school. -343---..,......------......,.......--.---------.-~-~--~- ~-~ L .;; LOP ,. After the girl had been transferred, and with her coopera\u00ad tion, Commission investigators furnished officers of the Chicago Police Department with information concerning a man alleged to have been her pimp. The man was subsequently arrested and charged with Contributing to the Sexual Delinquency of a Minor. After receiving his Miranda rights, the man was interviewed by a Com\u00ad mission investigator. In essence, while denying any sexual con\u00ad tact with the minor girl. or having acted as the girl's pimp, the man told us that the girl was heavily involved in prostitution when he first met her. He said that she had become involved through another resident of the Wellington House. He added that he was just her \"friend,\" and that he had freedom to call her or pick her up right outside the Wellington House with no interfer\u00adence from staff. We interviewed Broten again in our offices on October 9, 1981. He spent a good deal of time discussing the history of the agency, which we have presented. Broten said that virtually all of the agencyC s growth over the past twenty years was the result of an increase in demand for services by DCFS. When DCFS began opera\u00ad tions in 1964, Broten said, it realized that it might need con\u00adtractual services for girls. Regarding the children served, Broten said that the only thing the girls have in common with one another is age. The agency re\u00ad ceives referrals of all types of girls with all types of problems. Individualized services are provided to these girls. He said that the child care worker assists the children with whatever problems they may have and also bolsters services render~d by ouher p~o- ~ fessional staff. Broten mentioned that the program is built~on \"psychoanalytical principles\" but utilizes an eclectic approach, which \"anything that works.\" Broten commented tha't thE~ agency's philosophy is not to build a locked-in system, such as positive peer counseling, but to utilize a variet~ of approaches' in order to remain IIloose.\" Around 1970, when DCFS was demanding more and more services'; the agency purchased three of its nine facilities. \u00b7At this time, the agency also began discussion regarding development of its own independent living program to augment services then being provided in the group homes. Initially, he said, Bartelme ran this pro\u00ad gram and distributed allowances to clients for DCFS without charge. However, in 1971, Bartelme entered into a contract with DCFS for these services. Bartelme was paid to provide services to the girls and also to funnel DtFS money to the girls for their living ex\u00ad penses. At this time, the Bartelme staff also decided that some of the girls did not seem appropriate either for group home life or completely independent living; as a result, the concept oftran\u00ad sitional living in an apartment setting was born and implemented at the Gunnison Apartments, also funded by DCFS. Also in 1971, Mary Bartelme Homes added both the Dover Group Home and the South Shore Group Home, both of which handle eight girls. Broten charqcterized the Dover facility as an intensive care and secure home, with two staff members on duty at/all times. -344-it .' J ,..:-I f r I I I i 1\u00b7 t t , ,~ -~ .\" l J r '\\1 , < J Girls at Dover are not allowed to go anywhere unless accompanied by a staff member, similar to what we have learned about the Essex House. Essex House was the next home opened by the agency. He said that it was opened in late 1977 or early 1978 as a \"unit\" of JSPA. Broten explained that he had been one of the principal architects of the JSPA program and philosophy. Broten told us that the Sandberg School was opened in 1977. In the same building with classrooms are offices for social work\u00ad ers of the city's north side group homes. The building is owned by the agency. One program not previously discussed opened in 1978. It is the Adolescent Mother's Program, first begun as an off-shoot of the Independent Living Program. All of the girls chosen for the program are assessed to be potentially capable parents who have specific educational or vocational goals. In 1980, Bartelme had 70 qirls involved in independent living and 30 in the Adolescent Mother's Program. Although these two programs had diverged in 1978, they merged again in 1981, according to Broten. Another program, providing family services, also began in 1978. This program was designed to serve girls living at hom~ or in foster care and is oriented toward counseling (one seSS10n per week). There are 30 gi~ls in the program~ Th~ families are not charged for the counse11ng. All of the g~rls 1n the program are referred by DCFS. Broten also addressed the issue of staffings, which are held quarterly. He said that the DCFS worker, probation officer, psy\u00ad chological consultant, and family members are invit~d.t'? atten~ \" these major staffings (he said that there are also m1n1-s:aff1ngs held periodically and unpredictably as needed). Broten sa1d that an appearance by the DCFS worker is totally unpr~dictable and de\u00ad pends on the individual worker. Generally speak1ng, though, DCFS workers do not attend these staffings . In emergency cases, on the other hand, DCFS has a good respon~\u00a2 rate, Broten said. ~r'?ten characterized treatment. of the g,irls in Bartelme I s care as a J01nt effort between his staff and DCFS's. Generally, DCFS staff fol\u00ad low the plans developed up 1f th~y wish: DCFS workers regularly fail to show up. In addition to the staffings just mentioned, Broten said that the entire counseling staff holds two staffings per week. The first is for individual cases at the intake stage. The secon~ is a staffing with a consultant to discuss individual, specif1c problems with girls in the homes. At intake, goals and plans are spelled out for c:ll ,?f th~ girls. Generally, he said, the gOal is to get the g1rl 1nto 1n\u00ad dependent living or sent home. He added that about 80% of the Bartelme graduates go into independent living arrangeme~ts a~d about 20% are returned to their homes. We about 1nter1m -345~ ~-. ...----------,. -----~---~-~---------~---- -- ---- -~-~ goals. He responded that the major thrust of the program was to integrate the girls well in the group home situation. The g,irls also receive motivation in cooking, getting a job, going to school, saving money, and interacting appropriately with other girls in the home. Edwin Be, who accompanied Broten to the Commission offices along with Mary Ann West, mentioned that many of the girls sent to the Bartelme homes have been involved in extremely destructive behavior. Another goal of the agency is to help the girls dis\u00ad card such behavior. Be adde'd that each girl has an individual\u00ad ized treatment plan developed for her, sometimes involving tradi\u00ad tional therapy and sometimes not . Similarly, when rules are bro\u00ad ken, there is no set punishment; each case is decided on its own merits with the particular girl in mind. When we asked about the success rate of the agency, both Broten and Be stated that they do not keep records regarding such a statistic. They said that they do not think in terms of success or failure. Broten and Be guessed that about 80% of all referred girls either go home or are sent to independent living arrange\u00ad ments. About 2.0% of the girls are terminated: either they leave of their own accord or the agency decides to send them back to DCFS. Broten explained that some girls simply are not suited to a fairly open community-based group home. Be said \"'that success is difficult to measure because each girl presents a complex cluster of problems that must be analyzed. It is hard to define recidivism in these cases or determine any sort of long-lasting success. He concluded that outcome measures are dif\u00a3icult to apply to the Bartelme Homes. Be said that the Bartelme app;roach is \"psychoanalytic,1I not behavioral. Intimacy between the girls and the staff should help the girls in dealing with other interpersonal relationships. Be admitted that recently the agency has moved in more of a behavioral direction in its programs. . Mary Ann West added that IIpsychotherapy!: is provided by the social workers during individual counseling with girls. Consult\u00ad ants are also called in for counseling. WE:;!st explained that the group homes provide goal-oriented group therapy, such as trying to teach the girls individual living skills, values, and clari\u00ad fication. The group therapy approach includes periodic community meetings, in which the staff and the girls discuss specific prob\u00ad lems occurring in the home. Be then took over explanation of the treatmen~ approach, which he told us was founded on milieu therapy. This therapy, he said, is based on the idea that everything that happens to a person has so.me kind of impact. Consequently, Bartelme staff has attempted to build a diverse program that can deal with the many things that may happen to. a person during her life. This accounts for the recreational component and some of the skil\\ls that are -346-, I [ ~ I I t 1 1 f ! i t q - .-Al't ,. .1 :\" l o '.1 I I 1 j taught the girls. Be told us also that the style of therapy em\u00ad ployed by his agency is based on a book by Al Trieschman called The Other 23 Hours. We asked the three to comment specifically on how the indi\u00ad vidual components interact during a typical week. West explained that there is one recreational group activity every week. There is an individual counseling session that is, at most, an hour long. There is one group meeting that lasts an hour, and a community meeting that lasts another hour. West also said that community meetings may not be held each week. Use of consultants, she said, is rare and therefore not built into any weekly schedule. Individual counseling is traditional: the girls talk about their feelings and hew they think they are doing in the group home. Group therapy meetings are also traditional, focusing on problems in the home o.r q particular topiC. For instance, the group meet\u00ad ing might be as~ertiveness training one week and art therapy the next. The group recreation program is not required, West said. We asked West what types of restrictions might be placed against girls who fail to obey house and agency rules. She re\u00ad plied that privileges might be denied, allowance money might be withheld, or a more stringent curfew might be enforced. West told us that the house director will tolerate some disobedience of the rules, depending on how long it continues. She added that if the house director or counselor feels that a girl is making progress, she might be a little more tolerant of infractions e When asked about the allegation that several of the Welling\u00ad ton House girls were involved in prostitution, West said ,that ma~y of the, girls assigned to the Bartelme system may engage J.n prostJ.\u00ad tution. West feels that her agency is appropriate for these girls, depending, of course, on how heavily the girls are involved in the activity. She said that they will refuse admittanqe to and discharge any girl who is or becomes heavily involved in prostitu\u00ad tion. She said that sometimes, even after the prostituti~n has been discovered, DCFS may try to force th~ agency to. cont;L~ue treatment with the girl. West said that they try to get gJ.rls out of prostitution and sometimes are successful\" She also co~\u00ad mented that the girls that are reJerred to the agency are partJ.\u00ad cularly prone to sexual exploitation; she felt that prostitution among the agency's population was more of a symptom of a problem than a problem in and of itself. We asked West about the contract with Sandra O'Brien asking her to obey curfew rules at least 80% of the time. Broten said that that particular contract 'Was \"inappropriate.\" West sai~ that O'Brien's case was extreme and thabthey probably tolerated J.nfrac\u00ad tions of the rules longer than they shoul,d have. \"However I West added, sometimes it becomes extremely difficult to terminate a girl, especially when staff becomes emotionally attached to. her. She told us that the deciSion to terminate depends in large mea\u00ad sure on lithe amount of inve,stments staff will have in the kids .,n -34 7~' \\ , I I Broten allowed that there might be a problem with Bartelme's night supervision. Ideally, he would li~e to have two people awake at night at all times in all of the homes, but the agency cannot afford it, given the reimbursement rate provided py DCFS. Broten mentioned that the way the homes are scattered all over the city is both good and bad. On the one hand, the chil\u00ad dren can blend into their particular neighborhoods and ,make use of community resources so tl~~t they will have more of a feeling of belonging to a community.\\\\ On the other hand, the distance cre\u00ad ates some supervisory problems; no one has direct supervision over facilities as Broten would like to have. ',Broten felt a need for centralized medical, vocational, and administrative services. With facilities dispersed, it becomes hard to manage such centrali\u00ad zation. Broten told us that there is some flexibility in each faci\u00ad lityas rules. This he viewed. as related to the idea of each home being part of a different community. Broten said that in enforc\u00ad ing the rules, his staff hopes to err on the side of being con\u00ad siderate, thoughtful, and non-punitive. Broten emphasized that, in spite of flexibility in rules, there is still central control and review. Toward the conclusion of this long tnterview, Broten told us that he felt that the Commission had probably made some unfavor\u00ad able judgments about the agency's operations., especially since he was unable to provide any examples or concrete statistics con\u00ad cerning success ratios. He said that they do not have informa\u00ad tion that supports actual success. What they do have is the be\u00ad lief that the agency has made a ,real impact on some children's lives. He said that he personally has,seen many cases of success. Broten emphasized that the Ba:r:;telme staff supports girls ev~n, if the girls ar.\\e disobeying rules. These girls are bound to go, ,: ., through cycles of success and failure, and his agency provides the girls with the time to get through some of their problems with! support. He characterized the agency's philosophy as steady com\u00ad mitment to a child over an extended period of tii;ne with the hope that, in the long run, the girl will come aroundi\\ Broten felt it very important that the agency be tolerant of the girls' acti\u00ad vities without reprisals, while still acknowledging that limits had to be set on their behavior. Broten acknowledged that the agency had been too tolerant in certain cases, partially because staff was aware that there were no other resources for a girl be\u00ad s,ides a limited number of mental hospital beds. , Broten emphasized that he did not want to overly defend some of the\" problems that had been uncovered at the Wellington Housel including the repeated prostitution by seve;:\u00a7l of the girls, or Sandra O'Brien's contract with the home ~~ffarding curfew. Broten said that the real problem was that the entire Barte].me system needed more resources and a better linkage system. OutSide re\u00ad sources were also needed, so that Bartelme staff could feel free to recommend a girl's discharge, knowing that she would have some -348-Ii ~ ~'. tl !, If ~ ; Ij ! , p- t 8' .. {. r/ \\ PI l I place reasonable to go. Broten admitted that the Bartelme staff needed to be more consistent in its approach. to cases; continuity is necessary, he said. He mentioned that people want to tryout new ideas and as a result, rules are not enforced uniformly. Broten was emphatic in wanting us not to evaluate the entire Mary Bartelme Homes agency on the basis of the problems that we encountered a.t wellington House. He told us that he did not think the problem$ were agency~wide but were isolated to the Wellington House. Broten said that the problems at Wellington HOUse are unique and are not representative of the other homes. Perhaps, he said, the combina'tion of Wellington Hou$e I s location, staff, and res idents had created its problems. He said that these problems may arise at different periods of time in different homes simply because of the nature of the mix of girls present. As girls move in and out, the milieu changes. The Wellington House was located in an area reple'te weith bars, prostitutes, and other unsayory charac\u00ad teristics for a group home location. We asked Broten if he had any kind of information that might support his contention that the Wellington House was unique. He said that he did not have any_ We then suggested that perhaps if we reviewed school attendance records for all of the homes we would see that the Wellington House had much higher absenteeism than other homes. Broten agreed that this should show up in a review of school attendance recordso We therefore asked Broten to supply US with school attendance records for girls in all o~ the agency's homes. We also asked for any records that would 1n\u00ad dicate that the wellington House was having particular problems or that might compare 'the Wellington House with other group homes. On February 10, 1982, Broten sent most of what we requested along with a letter to our Executive Director, portions of which follow: In response to your letter of F,ebruary 9, I am attaching in\u00ad formation on the growth and development of the Mary Bartelme Homes, especially since I became Executive Director in 1961. On the issue of differences and similarities of group homes, I had emphasized at our conference in October that the Welling\u00ad ton Group Home, which you had singled out for special at,ten\u00ad tion, was .established with similar structure as were five other group homes. This meant a similar population, staff structure, basic ,rules and expectations, available services, equipment. Wellington was part of our Regular Group Home Program. Although similar in these respects, each group home could dif\u00ad fer in its milieu, its strengths and weaknesses, due to such factors as staff abilities, personalities and problems of resi\u00ad dents character of the building itself, resources or tempta\u00ad tions'of the neighborhood or nearby community, accessibility of special education, etc. Also, as I pointed out in our con\u00ad ference, group home programs do not remain sta~ic, and ch~nge from time to time as to their makeup and capac~ty to serv~ce certain youth. -349-.. au $# Thus, Wellington Group Home was similar to five other group homes; it also\" was unique--just as large famil~es, which look alike to the outside,r, differ from one another due to the people involved and their L~teraction with one another. Wellington Group Home operated with the same Basic.Rules and procedures as other R~gular Group Homes. While there may have been some inconsistencies and errors made by staff, I am con\u00ad vinced through our own evaluation that all staff members of, the Wellington House were intent onpro~~~~g the best p~ss1~le care for the girls placed there. The iL,;r,\\~\"'hatel:adersh1p-\u00ad Social were acknowledged pro :Lems m m, uen~m the behavior of certain girls--particularly some wl.th h1sto;ry of curfew violations or runaways. Contrary to your information, staff members have convinced me of the extensive efforts made to focus on problem behavior as well as develop a good milieu in the House. As criticisms were brought to our attention and as problems occurred, meet\u00ad jngs were held with staff members and with leadership people , downtown to work together to improve operations and answer crl.\u00ad ticisms o We found it important to re-stress expecta~ions both of staff and girls and to push for more consistent firmness in management. In regard to your stated attempt to be fair and objective in this \\inv~7tigation, I have reluctantly concluded that thi: was not achieved. Even your let.ter of February 9 tells me thl.s-- as you plan to conclude all !~ our facilities are the same. Your investigation took a year, off and on. It !t.riggered a parallel investigation by DCFS investigators. \u00a5,'hile there was interruption in your activity, \u00b1t did mean for our staff, es\u00ad pecially at the Wellington facility, that they were under at\u00ad tack and criticism. Feedback came back to them periodically about visits made to former residents whq said that the ~vestl~\u00ad qator indicated close up Welli..l1gton. Bouse~\" . '\",,~ Morale of staff suffered. Referrals for this Group Home dro~ped off. Unfortun.ately the Board of Directors decided to discontinue the operation of the W~llington Home effectiv~ octob:r 31, 1981. While it is possible that thisfac:i,lity may be react1vated there or at another location, ! consider this to be a serious setback in our overall effort to provide res idential care for this im\u00ad portant population of young people. We will not attempt to address all of the issues ~ontai~ed in Broten's letter. As the reo.d~r is aware, the DCFS ~nvest~ga\u00ad tion was not the result of our investigation but was the result of Hetty Hinckle and Sandra O'Brien's being tried for murder. -350-U' \\ oj-'\" t 1 d i , I ~ ~ II I One of the ~oc~me~~s furni~h7d to the Commissidn is the \"Mary Bartelme Homes D~sc~pl~nary Pol~c~es and Procedures (Group Homes) \" several brief portions of which follow: ' Rules, regulations, expectations must be well designed and be relevant to the age and needs of those b~ing served by the pro\u00ad gram. They should be clearly interpreted and should be adminis\u00ad tered with firmness, fairne~s, and consistency. J Many disciplinary problems arise because the rules and expecta\u00ad tions have not been clearly determined and explained, or be\u00ad cause there is not a consistent emphasis upon them and their enforcement. Violations shall be met with consequences which are related, if at all possible, to the offense, to the condi\u00adtions, and to the person. Basic rules shall be set on a uniform level by the agency for all residential units. More specific requirements shall be set by the individual group home as long as they do not conf+ict with the Basic Rules and as long as .. they are consistent with the overall philosophy of the agency., \" All such Rules shall be in written form, and shall be first approved by Unit Direct9r--and finally by Executive Director-\u00ad prior to being establiShed. They shall have input initially from girls and from staff and shall periodically be reviewed . Critical Inciden~ Reports shall be prepa;ed wh~ important Rules are broken and these shall be submitted 'as required,. '7-~nsequ:nces should be reasonable and appropriate, and sholl.ld be carr1ed out. (Hasty, excessive actions--which later are changed or ignored--are not helpful.}u Disciplinary actions taken shall be recorded in the log. We al~o we:'t\\'e furnished with a list of girls attending school, together w~th attendance records from girls in the different group homes. Of the 70 girls in Bart~lme's group home programs only six were not attending school\" The only one not attendin~ from' Wellington House was Sandra O'Brien. .. We reviewed the group homes' 1980-1981 school year attendance forms. The reader should recall that Broten characterized the Wellington House as being excessive in absenteeism and that an ~,analys~s Of, school attendance records would reveal that Wellington was un~que ~n the poor attendance 9f its girls. While exact com\u00ad parisons cannot be made among the diff\u20ac;1rent t'acilities, one gains a good idea of actual attendance by reV'ier'ing the separate sheets for 7ach group home's attendance. During the 1980-81 school year, Well~ngton House had seve~ girls in the home. Girls attended school anywhere from one month to six months, depending on refer\u00ad ral date and whether they were transferred out of. the home during -351-\\ I \\ // 1/ that school year. Regardless of the amount of time spent in school, the sheets we were given bre'ak out actual absences, which are comparable among all of the group homes. For these seven girls, during the one to six months the girls were attending school, the Wellington House had 77 days of absence. '> ,+he Greenleaf facility had rti\u00adcu'lar school year.' of the girls at!)tende~i school for the en\u00adtire year; one attended for only tl'lO months) The total number of recorded absences is 76. :7 Essex House had eight girls in care, three of whom attended the entire year and two of whom attended only three months. The total number' of days' absence was 1.19 .. The Maplewood facility had a single girl in residence for the portion of the school year from March, 1981, to June, 1981. This girl recorded 42 days of absence alone. She was present in school only 16 days. The Dover facility had eight girls in reSidence, none of whom attended the entire year and one of whom attended only one month. This group hOrne's sheet shows 198 days of absence. \" The Chas'e facility had five girls in reSidence, two of whom went to school for five months. one of w,hom attended for three days. Total number of days of < absence: 74. The Touhy facility had eight girls in residence during this \"school year~ None of the girls attended longer than five months. Average attend.anc~ was for three months s In spite of these low totals, the girls 'logged in 133 days of absences from school. .' Fitlally, the Lakewood facility had eight girls in residence al$o during this schoOl year. Only one of the girls at.tended the entire year; three attended only for two months,\" The Lakewood Home recorded 261 days of absence for that school year. In retrosp'ect, the ~lellington House .. school attendance is ac\u00ad tually fairly good compared to school attendance at other homes. Clearly, the comparison of school attendance records failed to distinguish the Wellington House as being unique among ~~e Bartelme Homes. We also 'asked the agency for each horne'S \"Critical Incident Reports\" for the same period. Our purpose was to examine the num~ ber, types, and dispositions of serious problems. The number of reports per home follows: Wellington 27 Chase a Touhy 16 ,Greenleaf 4 south Shore 5 Essex e 4 Jarvis 1 -352-I( t I I I 1 Dover 2 Gunnison 3 Our analysis of group home rules showed that Jar~is House, the facility with the lowest number of these reports f\" also had the most stringent rules for residents v far more stringent than the rules for Wellington House. The above figures do suggest that Wellington House was unique in at least the quantity of critical incident reports being filed. These reports take several forms. Some of them are actual critical incident report forms; others consist of case narratives on plain paper or memoranda from a worker to Broten or Be. The report on Sandra O'Brien is not a critical incident re\u00ad portf but rather a discharge summary, indicating that she was ter\u00ad minated from the agency upon her arrest by the police. Mary Beth Meyer'S summary says, \"At the time just prior to the alleged inci\u00ad dent, it was deCided .to refer Sandi to our Independent Living Pro\u00ad gram, with possible consideration for Gunnison apartment, a tran\u00ad sitional group living program. Given Sandi's age, it was felt that further group home placement would not provide the necessary incentive for Sa.ndi to take more active steps concern:tng her fu\u00ad ture.\" One of the more interesting documents is a Critical Incident Report from Greenleaf House. A description of the incident fol\u00ad lows, with the girl's name changed:' Jill spent the night out without permission, was invQ,lved in setting up another gtrl in the house for a possible rape. Jill and 1-2 boys dragged her onto the liLli, took her to one of the boy's houses, where they attempted to get her high, and took her clothes off so that the two boys could have interco.urse with her. However, they were unsuccessful in penetrating. The disposition for Jill? \"She will be grounded for 1 week.\" We examined some similar reports on girls in residence at wellington House. One of these reports follows, with the girl's name changed: A:\u00a3ter not gOing to school and refusing to tell her whereabouts, Leslie was asked ~p go to her room. She refused to do this and became verbally abusive. She left the house and was told by staff to return only with policemen. She attempted to get back in the' house via the fire escape and then thre\\'l something at the window in the staff office. She returned with. police\u00ad men 30 minutes later and was given the option to stay--abiding by the rules or to go with the police--she chose to stay but an hour later began disobeying sta;j;f again--would not stay in room, kicked a chair over'nearly hitting a staff member, and was verbally abusive. The police were called again and she was taken tc 23rq District where she was reprimanded by Youth Officers and boo~ed on disorderly conduct and ungovernable -353-.. 4 j , 4# i -- I 0 (J charges. She was allowed to return to Wellington after sign\u00ad ing a contract that she would abide by the rules. Disposition: Leslie is on restriction and knows that the next time she disobeys that she will be referred to Juvenile Court. Finally, we reviewed three critical incident reports on one girl in residence at the Wellington House in August, 1981. On August 18, she left the home without permission and was gone for 24 hours. When she returned, the disposition was for her to sit down with staff on duty and \"discuss what makes her leave. She agreed to work on feeling better about herself.\" Another report filed on the 31st, but referring to an incident earlier in the month, mentions that the same girl was brought to the home by po\u00ad lice officers who had picked her up for soliciting prostitution: \"On call person was notified and decision was to have police charge her. Youth Officer dealt with (yelled at her and lectured) and made a station adjustment.1I The disposition of the case is: \"Police record, counseling on seriousness of this behavior, DCFS notified.\" The third report concerns the period from August 21 through August 28. The same girl left the house with permission to go to the post office but did not return for three days. She was then taken to Jarvis House for a \"time-out.\" After stealing some money from a staff member's purse, she left Jarvis House via a window. She was returned to ;;jellington'House on the 28th by the police. That same day, while supposedly tak\u00ad ing a shower, she snuck out of the house and had not been seen since. The disposition? Staff notified police of a missing per\u00ad son and notified the DCFS worker. On September 28, 1981, the Executive Commit.tee of Mary Bar\u00ad telme Homes instructed Broten to close Wellington House, citing financial problems as the cause. Based on an extensive investigation, we must conclude that Mary Bartelme Homes has serious deficiencies in its internal ad\u00ad ministration~ The problems that surfaced during the investiga- tion have multiplied while nothing has been done to change the rules or regulations of the homes. The group homes enjoy a more\u00ad than-reasonable reimbursement rate from DCFS and enter into multiple contracts with DCFS each year. There is no program review by DCFS. If DCFS staff want to come to the facilities or even examine finan\u00ad cial records, they must notify administrative staff first. Even when investigating Sandra O'Brien's conduct, they were required to give as long as four days' notice before visiting the facili\u00ad ties. School attendance records indicate a poor performance by the agency in getting its residents to attend school, one of the few specific program requirements spelled out for all residents under 17. We can only suggest that DCFS examine its contracts with this agency more carefully and conduct its own programmatic and fiscal review before entering into contracts for the next fis\u00ad cal year. Alternative programs and requests for proposals should be considered. -354-,I \u00b71 1 1 '/ i ! , 1 J I M. CAUSES The Commission encountered Child Abuse Unit for Studies Edu\u00ad cation, and Services (CAUSES) when pursuing several case studies. The agency's performance and position concerning involvement with . other parties in protective services caused us to examine it closely. In late January, 1981, several Commission investigators inter\u00ad viewed Robert Antrim and Ernest Green of DCFS' Internal Audit Di\u00ad vision regardi~g a recent audit of CAUSES. The auditors cited as a \"weakness\" the fact that for every case examined in which Dr. Greenberg had been personally involved (regarding consulta\u00ad tion with CPS workers), there was absolutely no documentation in the CAUSES files. The explanation offered by a representative of the agency was that the DCFS worker should have the documenta~ tion in his file. The only way to verify Greenberg's time spent on cases would be to review every CPS worker's file on every case in which consultation was provided. The auditors did not consider this very practical. Twelve of CAUSES' employees are paid as independent consultants or contractors, including Dr. Greenberg, despite the fact that Greenberg is listed as the director of the agency. The auditors asked to see copies of the contracts for the twelve contractors, but CAUSES could produce no contracts in effect at the time. They did produce three or four expired contracts, including one that had been for Greenberg. Green also provided us with information regarding contracts and grants that CAUSES and Greenberg have with DCFS. Three of these are with CAUSES and two with Greenberg personally. The amounts for these contracts and grants are listed below: 1) Purchase of Service Contracts: $118,000 2) Child Abuse Grant: $ 40,000 3) \"Shelter Center Contract\" : (amount unknown at time of audit) 4) Individual DCFS Consultant: $ 40 per hour 5) Contract with the University of Illinois Medical Center: $ 16,943 Of these contracts and grants, the \"Shelter Center Contract\"ap\u00ad pears to be for diagnostiq consultation that Greenberg provides at the DCFS emergency shelter care facility, the Cleaver Street Shelter. Green also told us that DCFS pays the fifth amount list~d above directly to the University of Illinois Medical Center to cover part of Greenberg's university salary. Green told us that Greenberg and CAUSES also share two grants from the federal government, administered by the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect (NCAAN) of the Department of \"Health and Human Services (HRS). The first of these grants is a \"Clinj.\u00ad cal Treatment Demonstration Grant\" in the amount of $126,200, pius $53,000 in funds carried over from year. The -355-ra a; in the ameunt .of $200,000. Green added that Greenberg had teld him that he spends 40% .of his time werking the and anether 40% .of his werk\u00ad ing en beth federal grant prejects. Greenberg's werk at the Dwight Cerrectienal Center suppesedly .of the DCFS centract werk that he prevides. In March .of 1981 we were able te review the actual cempliance audit decuments themselves. The audit was prepared by Green and Matthew Cietti. Six majer issues were brought te light threugh this audit. The first issue is CAUSES' internal centre Is and an evaluatien .of present eperat~enal precedures. The audit.disqlesed that net all funds raised were acceunted fer; it recemrrlended that better business practices be used in acceunting precedures in the future. The secend issue was salary and fringe benefits fer CAUSES empleyees. The audit repeats what we have mentiened abeut the twelve empleyees alse being centracters, including audit recemmends Unit net appreve,further budgets until CAUSES' subcentractual decuments are en file with the Department as required. The third issue is a review .of the basis fer allecatien .of all ether cests and a review .of CAUSES' disbursement recerds. The audit determined that .occupancy cests were not allecated te all pregrams being to the federal grant pregrams. The federal pregram received ne allecatien at all and there was ne acceunting classificatien fer management and g~neral expenses. The audit recemmended that CAUSES preduce decumentation te shew why .occupancy costs were not included in fiscal informatien; that CAUSES allecate reasenable sums te management and general expenses; and that CAUSES .offer decumentatien as te why DCFS sheuld net request a refund fer .over\u00ad payment. The feurth issue was travel expenses; the auditers made ne recemmendatien regarding this issue. The fifth issue was an examinatien .of assets. Ne assets were pu~chased in FY 80, and ne recemmendatiens were made. The sixth issue was billings submitted te DCFS frem CAUSES. The auditers that there was nething t.o decument that an interview had taken place en the date reflected in billings . made te the Department. The auditers feund seme files with vir\u00ad tually ne decumentatien. The auditors cenclud,ed that the case file review in suppert .of billings was ne't cenclusive. The audi- -356-I r \\ f I that CAUSES promptly decument each client cen\u00ad tact in the client's file. The client centact weuld then serve as evidence .of service fer each ceunseling sessien billed te the Department In ~1arch .of 1981, DCFS furnished the Cemmissien with a pre\u00ad repert DCFS. The peried cevered by therepert was July 1, 1978, te June, 20, 1979. Greenberg cemments in the repert that when .the incest treatment preject began, seme .of the CAUSES staff had limited knewledge in certain areas cencerning incest and incest treatment. Theugh this lack .of knewledge existed, the pregram preceeded, using what knew ledge they had!; as a basis fer diagnesis and treatment .of certain types .of cases. The preject was characterized, in part, as a learning eXPerience. ,The incest treatment pregram in fact censists of twe separate pregrams. The first is the treatment pregram, which treats fami\u00ad lies that remain intact with ne law enfercement and/er court in\u00ad velvement, \u00a3\u00a3 families that a repert te law enfercement .officials, previded there is ne further legal ac\u00adtien taken. The secend pregram is a research cempenent. Incest cases are used fer data cellectien. There suppesedly had been 400-500 .of these ca~es, .of treatment cases were censidered cit \"subsample.1I Twe initial geals .of the preject are first te attempt te re\u00ad duce the crisis quality that prevails after the incest is made knewn .outside the family, and the secend te premptly previde treat\u00ad ment and services with cen.tinuity. The repert makes it clear that the agency dees net want to handle cases in which there is cen\u00ad tinuing police .or ceurt invelvement. The repert mentiens, as we have, that all sexual abuse cases are referred te CAUSES, and it is at CAUSES' discretien te accept .or net accept a case fer treat\u00ad ment. On December 19, 1980, a Cemmissien investigater spoke with Kee Macfarlane, Project Officer fer the Natienal Center en Child Abuse and Neglect, Office .of Human Develepment Services, Depart\u00ad ment .of Health and Human Services in Washi~gten, D.C. MacFarlane is a Pregram Specialist in the field .of sexual abuse. We called her te ask fer infermatien en the grant awarded te CAUSES fer diag\u00ad nestic assessment and treatment. We asked MacFarlane what type .of grant CAUSES had been given and what the nature .of its reperting precedures was. MacFarlane explained the difference between the twe grants that had been awarded te CAUSES. The first grant had been n:warded in 1978 fer a peried .of 3~ years. This grant is fer treatment alene; referrals from DCFS weuld mest likely fall under the purview .of this grant. Quar\u00ad terly reperts required by HHS weuld net list clients' names. The second grant was fer $200,000 and cevered a three-year peried. '\u00a311.is. National Training Institute Grant ~was te allew interested -357-parties to receive training at CAUSES in ways tOccombat child sex\";: ual abuse. MacFarlane told us that since no methods in use at the time of our telephone conversation seemed to be producing results, new methods must be found that will. She said that CAUSES has offered a program plan that sounds encouraging. She added that she has visited the CAUSES offices and found both projects \"hopeful.\" MacFarlane also told us that she was responsible for collect\u00ad ing and reviewing all documel1tation on programs that provide treat\u00ad ment for sexual abuse. She told us that there are about 25 pro\u00ad jects that deal with intrafamilial child sexual abuse and two re\u00ad search projects that treat the same subject. CAUSES has one of the latter two grants. We asked MacFarlane about CAUSES' philosophy of generally not treating separated families or families involved with the law. She responded that NCCAN was hesitant to fund only one type of treatment program. Rather than choose one type of program, it had attempted to fund the full range of programs. She added that there are so many factors that can influence a case of sexual abuse that it is important to have a range of treatment modalities avail\u00ad able. The first year Training Institutes wer~ funded, NCCAN received five proposals and funded one (Henry Giaretto's sexual abuse pro\u00ad gram in California); the second year, NCCAN had 16 applicants and funded four (including Greenberg's). MacFarlane said that NCCAN chose a national panel of experts in the field to ,review the pro\u00ad posals before grants were awarded. Six people were chosen, half from public and half from private agencies. MacFarlane said they ran into a slight problem with the panel because it seemed that all of the experts knew one another. MacFarlane said that she did not even read the proposals before the panel made its deci\u00ad sion because she knew all of the people submitting proposals. MacFarlane said that the two ends of the treatment spectrum are represented by CAUSES at one end (no police or court involve\u00ad ment, intact families) and the Harborview program in Seattle (strict criminal justice system involvement). She said that there were legitimate projects not funded because they were too similar to other projects receiving fundinq. Thus, unfortunately, the merits of the programs mattered less than where they fell on the spectrum. MacFarlane said that this was actually the panel's system and she wasn't sure she agreed with it. We asked MacFarlane if it were not dangerous to train CPS workers using standards that lay at one end of the spectrum if that end of the spectrum turned out to be wrong, or inappropriate for treatment. In that case, would a state have to retrain i,ts workers in the proper procedure and treatment? MacFarlane r~sponded that these questions were exactly why she was against funding train\u00ad ing institutes. Nonetheless, she said that the reason NCCAN could fund Greenberg's proqram, which generally was opposed to cooperat\u00ad ing with police and the courts, was that such a lack of coopera- -358-tion was not illegal under II~inois law, as it would be under many other states' laws. In many other states, the police must be noti\u00ad fied reqarding allegations of abuse. Then she said that treat\u00ad ment for sexual abuse is so new that when you provide some ser\u00ad vice you do not damage the child--you just use different methods if the original methods do not work or' are wrong. MacFarlane claimed that she had challenged Greenberg on more than one occasion about his attitudes and methods. He re~ponded, \"I'm a shrink. My job is healinq, working with people, it's treat\u00ad ment, itis health. Locking people up is not my job. I don't be\u00ad lieve in it. I think it makes them worse. And I won't do anything to support that system.\" MacFarlane then added that she gets calls all the time from across the country about how incest cases taken to court just do not work. And MacFarlane, who is a psycholoqist with a ,private practice, said that she has seen incest victims much worse off because of their involvement with court proceedings. Soon thereafter, we received a number of documents from MacFarlane. Included was a breakdown of fundina for CAUSES' In\u00ad cest Training Center. Of the $20Q,000 granted, $92,436 was allo\u00ad cated for personnel expenditures,. ,$51 ,000 was allocated for con\u00ad tractual serVices, and $21,800 was budgeted for \"other.\" The bud\u00ad get breakdowns indicate that Greenberg-was providing a total of $302,290 in \"non-federal resources.\" This funding consisted of $25,000 from the applicant; $157,290 from the State of Illinois; and $120,000 from \"other sources.\" The budget projected that Greenberg's project would need $200,000 per year for the next three years in federal funds alone. Included in the federal documentation is a good deal of narra\u00ad tive information about CAUSES, its past history, and its future treatment goals. Relevant information will be excerpted from those documents here. The CAUSES narrative states that the agency was begun in 1973 and first offered parentinq training to expec\u00ad tant mothers who were found to be \"at-risk.\" The determination of service needs had been carried out through specific testing done at Illinois Masonic Hospital and three Chicago Department of Health clinics. When DCFS' Child Protective Services unit be\u00ad gan to refer children to CAUSES, the realm of services was expanded to include full diagnostic evaluations prior to long-term treat\u00ad ment that included individual psychotherapy and family group therapy. Tfie document states that CAUSES has received 442 referrals in tbe previ6us three years. Regarding CAUSES' relationship with CPS, Greenberg's narrative states that CAUSES has a written agree\u00ad ment with CPS \"which clUthorizes CAUSES to develop a sexual abU,se registry on all CPS incominq case reports, to monitor the process\u00ad ing of these c~ses and jOintly with CPS, to assess and plan ser\u00ad vices for them.\"\u00b7 In a section' on the proqram's objectives and expected bene\u00ad fits, the narrative predicts that the training institute will serve 32 traine.es, resulting in 12 to 16 l1ew sexual child abuse treatment progr,:tms. -359-,1\\ Personnel and Budget information also is contained within the material sent to us bv NCCAN. Greenberg, as program Director/ psychiatrist, will earn a 12-month salary of $5,000, devoting 100% of his time to the program. other staff include a Director of ' professional Services, who also will devote 100% of his time to the proj.eqt, but who will be paid $35,000 a year, and an Institute Program Director, also devotinq 100% of his time, and being paid Finally, a port:~n of this narrative addresses how famili~\\s will be referred to CAUSES for actual treatment, as well as thJ, governing philosophy behind the ag~~cy, a portion of which fol~bws: $20,000. CAUSES Intrafamilial Childhood Sexual Abuse Grant Project serves patients througpout the County of Cook who are referred by the IllinoiS Department of Children and Family Services, Child Pro- tective Services. Intake criteria for referrals is ,.that there is no evidence that sexual abuse has or might hav'e occurred in an intact family. There should be minimal or no law enforce\u00ad ment/court complication in a case at the point of referral. \" The separation of family members includinq the placement of children occurs only in the'context of its therapeutic value. Such procedures are not carried out simply because of law en\u00ad forcement or agency poliCies and procedure. The principle, the central or overriding consideration is what will best serve the initiation and continuation of working cooperation to build, a functional and serious therapeutic alliance. This treatment philosophy does not imply what is sometimes interpreted to mean that the family should remain intact for the sake of intact\u00ad ness. The overridina and central concept is the development of therapeutic relationships in keeping with the well-being and future development of the child and other children in the family. This point of view recognizes and respects that even au abused child, harmed and exploited by a parent or one so entrusted may well have strong emotional investments in that person. And that it is to that child I s short-term and long\u00ad rang J betterment for her hope for a healthy, caring, nurturing and protective parent to be realized through changes in the parent brought about through the commitment of a therapeutic , relationship with the parent as well as with the child. This orientation is not in opposition to separating a parent frOID a child for the child1s protection from continuing sexual abuse and to reduce crises. HO\\1TeVer, separations are not car\u00ad ried out capriciously or arbitrarily or subjected to the whims of personal emotional convictions and the re-integr~tion of a family living together likewise, it is based on its thera\u00ad peutic indications which include the child1s safety. .. The prepara'tion for a family to once again live together needs 'co be carried out in the context of the family assuming such responsibilities, just as the initiation of a treatment rela\u00ad tionship constitutes the responsibility of individuals based qn trust, confidence and a growing awareness of the family1s and individual1s problems so also must these considerations govern their living together again. -360-<>\", ,\\ , t \\ ,-, r 1,/ ~ .. ~ 1:-''> n '.\\ .. r The ordering or commanding th' ;) coercive power of a threat froug~ ex~ernal authority and the tion not only interferes Wi~h ~unJ.Shme:~t built into that situa\u00ad individuals of a rare ortuni~:atmenyc~evelopment but denies respon,s,ibility whJ.'ch J.'sPPan essen '-Likewise, the ordering of a f '1' e~uJ.remE:n.~ for change. . amJ. y to lJ.ve apart d th ' suwg at some unknown late t' -'.C.aI'l. en l.S-:.(' them those opportunities tr l.IDe the command to reunite deny , 0 assume a responsib' 1 't f own lJ.ves and future in wh' h ' 1. 1.

Ethical rules are not synonymous with public opinion and the professional is not entitled to take public opinion as a di\u00ad rective; the professional has an affirmative duty to help shape public attitude. In the encouragement of open discu~sion and in the urging of renunciation of concealment by abusive parents of their un\u00ad toward behavior towards one or more of their children, there is an understanding in psychotherapy that talking about for\u00ad bidden behavior will not bring about punishment or rejection. The assurance of non-rejection and of a non-punitive response is not possible when the initial interview is being carried out by a worker as an agent of a legal agency not provided with the privilege of professional confidence or by a law en\u00ad forcement officer serving as a child protective service worker. The revelation of ideas, relations~ips, feelings and activi\u00ad ties recognized as forbidden and punishable, or as shameful and humiliating is difficult under conditions where the pa\u00ad tient or client is safe from punitive consequences or their threat. To assume that this is possible under punitive con\u00ad ditions or their threat or where ordered by an authority under coercive circumstances, approaches the incredulous. A thera\u00ad peutic relationship involves the search for understanding with\u00ad out J;ebuff. Informing a patient that a condition of service is the sharing of information with the court or with law enforcement ~ecog\u00ad nizes that such information could influence decisiqns on fam\u00ad ily dislocation, reunification and other major family condi\u00ad tions. These conditions of service certainly influence the content and facility of communication during treatment ses\u00ad sions and pose questions regarding the feasibility of treat\u00ad ment under conditions in which the clinician, social worker or therapist is in fact, directly or indirectly serving as an agent of the court, a clear conflict of interest. . When those who represent themselves as professionals, concerned with the feelings and needs of children. for their parents, understand\u00ad ing of relations between a cohesive family and the emotional well-being of its members, when these professibnals also par\u00ad ticipate in interventions which serve state ordered threat of penalty involving possible ax'rest and prosecution, loss of em\u00ad ployment, family dislocatiop and the postponement of efforts to establish worKing relationships among family members, there occurs serious breaches of ethical conduct . Greenberg's academic and related appointments listed on his curriculum vitae, which was received from DCFS in 1981 and was undated, follow: -362-Director, Child Development Clinic and Research Unit, Department of Psychiatry, University of Illinois ~.raham Lincoln School of Medicine Associate Professor, Department of Psychiatry, Abraham Lincoln School of Medicine Psychiatric Consultant, Niles Township High Schools II Medical Director Childhood Lead Poisoning Control Program, City of Chicago Depart\u00ad ment,. of Health Senior Consultant--Child Protective Services (Cook County), Department of Children and Family Services Executive Director \"Child Abuse Unit for Stud~~es, Education and Services '.\\ Illinois Masonic Medical Center Clinical Associate Institute for Psychoanalysis, Chicago Consultant, Head\"Start Training Center, Tuskegee Institute, Alabama Attending Psychiatrist ~llinois M~sonic Medical Center Chairman, Interdisciplinary Committee On Child Abuse and Neglect, City of Chicago Department of in Commission offices in September, '1981. He told us details of his background, and we asked him ques\u00ad tions concerning his involvement in incest treatment and child protec:::tion, including the operation of CAUSES. He told us that he had bel3n involved in a variety of research projects at the University of Illinois Medical School, in cooPE7ra\u00ad tion with the Chicago Department of Health, in the 1960's. ThiS work led to the formation of a community health program in uptown called the Maternal and Child Health Center in 1969. The purpose of the group was to provide services to children in a community health program setting. Greenberg was involved, he,said, from ,; \" -363- 1969-1972 and eventually became the director of the center. Sub\u00ad sequently, Greenberg became the director of a. program that grew out of this original project; the new program was called the Uptown Neighborhood Health center. A~ he became aware of the fragmented services available to children, Greenberg put together the Uptown Task Force on child abuse. Greenberg said that several DCFS staff members became involved and one of the DCFS administra.tors noticed the work that he was doing in case consultatibn. He said that she invited him to become a case consultant for DCFS. Greenberg I s first involvement had to do w.ith intake: he be\u00ad came active in sitting down with night staff.to se~ ho~ ~hey handled calls. Eventrpally, his involvement led to hJ.s avaJ.labJ.lJ.ty to all DCFS intake staff. As the years passed, Greenberg was asked to become mor~ ~n\u00ad volved in one-to-one consultation with workers. He began VJ.SJ.t\u00ad ing area offices to help workers solve problems in their ca:eloads. Greenberg said that eventually his work became Cl:lmost a s'emJ.nar approach, based on case studies that he had done. Greenberg said that he began case consulta~ion during Director Jerome~iller's tenure, but added that it was during the tenure of Director Margaret Kennedy that he became a paid consultant. Greenberg also wasn I t sure what his agreement was for consul'ta\u00ad tion though he said that he was sure that he would have wanted it t~ be \"pretty much open-ended as far as time spent.\" Greenberg told us that he put in many more hours than he billed the Depart\u00ad ment for or was paid for. Greenberg guessed that the cQnsulta\u00ad tion/rate for that time might have been in the range of $20-25 an hour. He added that though he put in more hours, he guessed that he billed the Depa:r:tment for onl~ four hou.~s per week. Greenberg told us that one of the problems he tried to deal with early in his work with the Department and now, is the.Depart\u00ad mentis lack of clinical services for clients and a concomJ.tant lack of training for staff. Greenberg stated that his.fr~stra\u00ad tion at not being able to get clinical services from wJ.thJ.n DCFS led hlin to create CAUSES. He felt that DCF~' having to ~o to the \"outside\" for cll.nical assessments and servJ.ces was a faJ.lure, but at least the services then are available. Greenb~rg told us that the true mark of his success will be if CAUSES goes out of existence because its services have been drawn into the Depart\u00ad ment where they belong. Greenberg said that part of his involvement with D9FS i~ made possible through an arrangement between DCFS and the UnJ.versJ.ty of Illinois Medical Center. Through this arrang~men.t, DCFS.unde::\u00ad writes part of Greenberg's salary at the universJ.ty. He saJ.d thJ.s is in the amount of $15,000, a half-time salary based on 20 ~ours of work. He added that this amount should go up to $18,000 l,n 1982. The contract that DCFS holds with CAUSES for diagnostic cen\u00adter work is separate and makes use of other professionals at CAUSES, -364- \" j Greenberg explained. Greenberg said that his function is only to assure that services actually are delivered to DCFS clients. Greenberg said that he receives no money from the contract with CAUSES dia.gnostic center. Greenberg also told us that the last year he held a contract as DCFS consul~ant was 1979: He said that this was a ~rsonal contract that J.S po longer J.n effect. Howev~r, he still provides consultation for CPS through the contract that DCFS has with the University of Illinois Medical Center. Time spent through this contract also includes any hours,he spends working with the diag\u00ad nostic center. This payment, then, .is based on 20 hours of work per week; Greenberg indicated that actually he puts in 30-40 hours per week. In addition to this time, Greenberg said that he sees between three and five private patients per day. Greenberg then explained the nature of his relationship with the 9niversity of Illinois. In 1961, he was awarded a 10-year career investigator position by the National Institute of Mental Health. In effect, he was awarded a tenured position to conduct research \"which enhances the body of knowledge\" at the University. He said that the work he does with DCFS fulfills his obligation to the University. The other half of Greenberg's salary is provided by the Chicago Department of Health for 12-14 hours of work per week. Greenberg said that the University places no restrictions on his time; he added that he does very little teaching for the University. Greenberg stated \"for the public record\" that he intended to retire at age 55 (four years from the time of the interview). Greenberg told us that since the Directorship of Margaret Kennedy he has had a grant for the study of sexual abuse, but that 1981 would be the grant's final year. He added that he has very little knowledge of the financial elements of the grants and con- ,tracts held by CAUSES. Greenberg estimated th,at he probably spends 15 hours a week on the sexual abuse area. Greenberg estimated that he works 80-90 hours per week, on the average. He added that the number of hOurs he spends on these different areas will vary from week ,to week .. depending on what is most urgent. The next project that Greenberg mentioneq was the CAUSES pro\u00ad gram at the Dwight Correctional Center. Greenberg said that he tries to \"get down there\" at least once a week. He added that his only. perspnal reimbursement W{lS for travel exp'enses. The em\u00ad phasis of'the program, he said, ilf on the establishment of \"mothers' groups\" within the prison and on training Dwight staff to help them deal with abusive mothers. Also, CAUSES staff was providing psychological studies on women coming to Dwight to help identify the group that needs service the most. He told us that Clifford Rot is at Dwight twice a week; that Judy Gentile visit.s twice a -365-week; and that Bernice Kravitz is there three times a week. Kravitz supposedly was \"inundated\" with calls from women requesting h .. er help. Greenberg also said that CAUSES has been active at Dwight for three years, only one of which was througha. grant. He said the other two years they provided volunteer services. We asked Greenberg if CAUSES receives every ca~e of child sexual abuse that comes in to Cook County CPS. He said that while these cases had been referred in the past, the referral was no longer being done. Greenberg added that CAUSES collected data from these referrals, which was then given to i?C.FS. Greenberg did not know what DCFS did with the material. ;/ Greenberg said that CAUSES will be getting out of some areas of sexual abuse study. 'I'he agency still will provide training where there is interest; it will also still provide diagnostic assessments. But he said he will not request any additional fund\u00ad ing from DCFS for research on sexual abuse. Greenberg said that he has been involved for some time in the study of infant mortality with the Chicago Department of Health, and he probably would de\u00ad vote more time to that work as his involvement with DCFS decreases. :) We specifically questioned Greenberg regarding his views on the role of the criminal justice system in dealing with the physi\u00ad cal and sexual abuse of children. Greenberg responded that he felt the issue of the social service system versus the criminal justice system never had been adequately addressed. He felt that any effort to treat a child victim from a criminal justice point of view would end up compromising the social service part of the equation. Either no treatment will be possible in such a case or attempts at treatment will be limited by what the criminal jus\u00ad tice system will allow. Greenberg felt that working with a child to get him to testify at a trial could not be considered thera\u00ad peutic. Greenberg continued by saying that programs that deal with the criminal justice system rely upon \"admissions of guilt II .. by the father before children or families will be accepted into treat\u00ad ment programs. This admission of guilt, to Greenberg, does nothing but establish a plea bargaining position amenable to the police and the prosecutor. Greenberg claimed that in all of his years in the sexual abuse field, he has encountered only one .man who did not admit his guilt (and he felt that man was innocent). Greenberg's other major complaint\u00b7about programs that work with the criminal justice system is that many of the offenders actually go to jail. He told us that Henry Giarretto had once mentioned to him that more than half of the men in his own ptogram go to jail for at least two-three months. In January of 1981, we spoke with John Goad, a CPS supervisor in Chicago. Goad had been briefly involved with one of the incest cases that we have included in this report. t-le asked him to ex\u00ad plain the role that Greenberg and CAUSES had played in the case, and then asked him more general questions that arose from his com- -366-b f; I I ments about treatment and reporting. Goad told us that he had problems with the content of reports submitted by CAUSES. But, he added, he thinks that in working with Greenberg, the agency has made progress with reports. At the same time, Goad told us that he was very satisfied wlth the work that Greenberg has done. He told us that he \"trusts Dr. Greenberg without reservation.\" Goad .also referred to the specifics of the incest case, which had been in and out of treatment with CAUSES for a fairly long period of time. We asked what CPS had done while the case was in treatment and what it had done when CAUSES terminated treat\u00ad ment with th~ family. Goad told us that while the family was in treatment, CPS did nothing on the case. When CAUSES terminated the case, apparently CPS still did nothing because, Goad said, the family continued to see Dr. Greenberg as private patients. Goad even said that during most of the period from the first re\u00ad ferral to CAUSES until their final termination, the family case file was closed. When we interviewed then-Cook County CPS Director Jeanine Smith, we asked about Greenberg's involvement with her CPS unit, its history, and what she thought of the work that he had done. She told us that when she came to Cook County, Greenberg already was providing consultation services to what was then called Emer\u00ad gency Protective Services (EPS). As reports of aexual abuse began to increase in Cook County, Greenberg began to specialize in that area. She told us that Greenberg's \"major contractll with the Department was to 'provide diagnostic services. She said the contrc:ct was p~ovi~ed by the Centralized Resource Unit and that she d1d not wr1te 1t or work on it. She added that a Request for Proposal (RFP) came,from Springfield and Greenberg responded to it. Smith estab11shed a five-or six-member advisory committee to review all of the re\u00ad sponses to proposals for child abuse grants. G~eenber~'s grant was one of the first to be awarded by this comm1ttee, 1n 1976-77. We asked Smith to explain the criteria for sending sexual abuse cases to CAUSES. They include: non-court intervention; a decision based on case staffing with CAUSES workers; and a re\u00ad quest for help by a DCFS worker. We mentioned that CAUSES could do both a diagnosis on a case and a case assessment. The result would be that CAUSES staff could refer the case, by assessment, to CAUSES for treatment. Smith maintained that this was no problem because the DCFS worker would have to instigate this action. She said that it is not true that all cases of sexual abuse are referred to CAUSES. She said that CAUSES receives a copy of each case report, but this is for sta\u00ad tistical purposes, not fort.reatment. Smith added, that Greenberg's work in gathering statistics was valuable because 1t has added to the IIbody of knowledge\" in the field. We asked Smith about records submitted by CAUSES. She said that individual DCFS case files should contain copies of any mate- -367-\\ I rial submit,ted or written by CAUSES staff; this would be the re\u00ad sponsibility of the DCFS liaison worker. Smith said then that not all information is always in the file because bf'the c~nfiden\u00adtiality provision regarding mental health cases. H,pwever, she said that a telephone call to Greenberg usually couid get docu\u00ad ments into their hands quickly. Smith also mentioned that the possibility of court intervention might play a part in certain information being omitted from CAUSES records that would go to DCFS. Smith said that the ultimate decision to take a case to court rests with DCFS~ not Nahma~ Greenberg. Thus, if he is handling cases that requ~re or rece~ve no court intervention, it is because DCFS decided not to take the case to court. Smith added that the DCF~ debision to take a case to court or not can happen before, d':lr~ng, or after CAUSES' involvement. She said that Greenberg w~ll follow through on some cases with which the courts are in\u00ad volved, or in which the children have been placed outside of the horne, bu\u00b7t not many. 'f . We spok~ in April,;/of '1982 Dr. Robert Stein, Cook County Med~cal Exam~ner, to ~ee what progress had been made on a program funded by part of one,/'of Greenberg I s DCFS grants. This particular grant called for the ~rovision of four separate services the last of which was for Greenberg to assess the role of child m~ltreat\u00ad ment in infant and child mortality and to design prevention strate\u00ad gies. This part of the grant called for coordination with the Cook C~unty Medical ~xaminer's Office and the Infant Mortality and Ch~ld Abuse Cornrn~ttees of the Chicago Department of Health. . We learned from Stein that Greenberg had first approached h~m regarding this service in April, 1982, though the project was to have concluded on August 31, 1981. No one from his office had been approached about establishing cooperati~e efforts with Greenberg prior to April, 1982., . Also during April we spoke with Doris Ausbrook, Administrative Director, Bureau of Family Health, Chicago Department of Health regarding the same contract. Ausbrook was not aware of any such program or cooperat~ve effort with Greenberg. She called Greenberg, and an investigator spoke with him. He told us that \"no real serious program exists but there have been a series of cornrnunications--that is what I brought about.\" Greenberg said that the program hq,d in .fact been instituted through his continuing informal converSa~\\iOnS with staff of the Chi~ago Depart~ent of Health and the~cooM~countY\"Medical Examiner's Off~ce. He sa~d that he had spoken just ~hat week with Dr. Stein. \",,1 Greenberg asked our investigator how., much time the grant re\u00ad quired him to spend on this progr.am. When told the contract called for 18-20 hours per week, Greenberg responded that it would have been impossible to do all the grant called for because there were not enough hours in the day. He told us that we had taken the wording of the grant too literally. -368-, f To provide a contrast to Greenberg's met~od of treati~g in-. cestuous families, we will refer to an interv~ew that our ~nvest~\u00ad gators conducted with Michael O'Brien, Director, I~cest.Offender Treatment Program Minnesota Department of Correct~ons ~n St. Paul, Minnesota. O'Bri~n provides case management for convicted sex offenders in treatment. He also provides information for the court when a probation officer needs to present a presen~ence report:~_ O'Brien tO,ld us that his program grew out of the M~nnesot,,:, leg~s lature's realization that there needed to be some sentenc~ng alter\u00ad native for incest offenders. O'Brien felt Minnesota had alw,,:,ys been in the forefront of states recognizing incest as a spe~~al problem.. He mentioned that 10% of all reports of sex1lal ch~ld abuse that reached the American Humane Association had corne from Minnesota. Obviously, he said, Minnesota does not have 10% of the incest cases in the Country, but the state does have a better system for identifying cases. O'Brien told us that there are 300-400 cases of incest reported in the state each year. The cases are identif~e~ thr~ugh.either the child protective services system or the cr~m~nal Just~ce system. He estimated that 70% of all cases go unprosecuted. O'Brien told us that it was important for the incest offender to be removed from the horne because it places the responsibility for the crime solely on the offender. If the offender must leave the horne the victim is more likely to feel that the offender was to blame' for the incident not the victim. He also said that the offender then has a goal to work toward--to get back ~n to the horne. Finally, O'Brien pOinted out what we have ment~oned.before, that the power in the family is frequently sk~wed on the s~de.of the offender and that his power base can be d~srupted by forc~~g him to leave the horne, thereby giving the mother and other fam~ly members a greater opportunity to develop some strengths of the~r own. In contrast to his own approach, O'Brien volunteered infor\u00ad rnationon Greenberg's CAUSES program. O'Brien called the program interesting. He told us that Greenberg feels that th~ prob17m exists within the entire family and therefore the ent~re fam~ly must remain intact in order for treatment to be effective. We asked O'Brien what he felt about the problem, and he said that there is a fairly good likelihood that there will be no future abuse even if the offender does remain in the home. The offend7r usuallY is very scared about what has happened. However, he sa~d also that tt.e victim should not have to remain afraid to be in the home with the man she has accused of a crime. , , O'Brien mentioned that he has met Greenberg and talked to him on occasion at conferences. He indicated that Greenberg felt that incest was mis'understood by the court and that it was a prob\u00ad lem of family dysfunction, not a problem of cri~ina~ proportions. O'Brien felt that not only should the criminal Just'l.~e system be involved in treatment of incest offenders, but that l.t could be an asset to therapy. He said that even for the offender to plead guilty might be good for his mental health. -369- .. > o 'Brien also mentioned that a \"typiGaP' sentence in Minnesota will be 5-10 years probation for charges c5f-~U2c~st, including suc\u00ad cessful completion of an incest !;:.ceatl11ent progranr.~~JJ3ri~n' s pro,,: gram charges its families for ~~Jte:tapy; these charges usua.ll1.(_. amount to $3 000-$4,000 per year. Q~13rien felt that this was an ext:tem~ly cost-~ffective approach to c<;ninseling, considering prison costs ,~.-.\u00ad and the, possibility of furtl1er anti-social behavior by either of\u00ad fender or victim if they remain untreated. O'Brien gave our investigator a document titled \"Guidelines for the Assessment of Incest Offenders.\" The following excerpt from the document more fully explains this particular treatment approach: If the o~fender is to be treated on an outpatient basis, it has beeni!our experience that such clinical intervention is more effective when it is mandated by the court as part of a disposition in a criminal proceeding. Initially, the offender may make a serious effort to understand himself, his feelings, and the reasons for his offense. Family and marital problems which may have played a contributing role in the offense may be submerged as wife and children feel pressured to unite with the'offender against the external threat of prosecutione con\u00ad viction, incarceration, and disruption of the nuclear family. When these immediate threats and pressures subside, however, there may be a re-emergence of the offender's characterologi\u00ad cal behavior. Several other pertinent excerpts from this 'document are added below. They generally contradict the g~idelines used. by Greenberg and CAUSES: Treatment Conditions 1. You are dealing with an unmotivated client. He is not self-referred. It will, therefore, be important to in\u00ad sure his cooperati.on in a treatment program by having his part:i,cipation mandated by an external authority such as a court. 2. His sexual offense is not only' a symptom, it is also a crime and needs ~o be dealt with on both levels, requir\u00ad ing a combined mental health/social servic.e and criminal,. justice intervention. 3. He fears the adverse social and legal consequences of disclosure and will, tperefore, tend to deny the offense or minimize his responsibility for his actions. He must not be allowed to deny his offense, minimi.ze the, serious\u00ad ness of his behavior, or ibility for his aCtions el,sewhere. -370-II /1 4. 5. 6. He has operated from a position of power in regard to his victim and has maintained his control by effecting secrecy in regard to his offense. The conventional therapeutic contract typically involves confidentiality. For this type of client, confidentiality contributes to the dynamics of secrecy and reinforces the offender's position of power a~d control. It should be waived. Not only must any s~~pected or known incident of incest\u00ad uous behavior be reported to the proper authorities, but also if the offender's spouse is not aware of the situa\u00ad tion, he must inform her of it, describing what has oc\u00ad curred. In the case of sibling incest, the parents must be similarly informed. The offender should be told from the outset that the worker may divulge information ob\u00b7\u00ad tained in treatment to court\" probation, parole, or other agencies upon request and whenever such disclosure seems warranted in the judgment of the worker. The clinician's primary responsibility is not the offender-client but the protection and well-being of the victim. Although incest is a sexual offense, it i~ not predomi\u00ad nantly fIlotiviated by sexual needs. :Et is the sexual ex\u00ad pression of non-sexual needs. It will be necessary, there\u00ad fore, to help the offender uncover the underlying non\u00ad sexual'needs and issues __ prompting his offense Although other family members may play a contributing role in the evolu'tion of thE! incestuous relationship, the offender's responsibility for the offense cannot be mitigated by viewring incest as solely the product of fam\u00ad ily dysfunction. The offender must be held accountable and, therefore, famiJ.y therapy should not be the only and especially not the initial plan of action. It must be preceded by individual treatment. As this report is being written, CAUSES continues to receive referrals from DCFS and is still operating through federal grants to treat the victims and tne perpetrators of child sexual abuse. -371 ... / / ': . ~~~~~--~----------------------------------------~--~--------- I'\" \\,.

Though we had t l::>out multidisciplinary teams before we visited seven ~tatej ..Jr than Illinois, we lep.rned a good deal about this particul .esponse to the childabyise problem while out of state. The t~1ps provided perspective concerning several different child protection systems; most states provided an inter\u00ad estingand useful contrast to the system in Illinois. The trips also allowed us to explore particular programs of which we had been aware as the investigation progressed. Many of the states that we visited had established the multi\u00ad discipl~nary team as a tool for handling cases of child abuse and neglect. Still, the different states varied in their approach to use of the M-D team and to methods of formation. This chapter com\u00ad piles information gleaned from interviews, conferences, and research concerning multidisciplinary teams. A. Out-ot-State Visits An' important part of our investigation was, a brief examination of the way other states address child abuse and neglect. We ac\u00ad complished this not only., through a review og;\"avcdlable literature, but also through visits to seven other states. The 'states we visited were California, Colorado, Florida, 'Michigan, Minnesota, New York, and Virginia. These were selected for a variety of reasons One was the\" level of government re\u00ad sponsible for', administering chil'd protection programs. According to a 1979 survey by the American Humane Association, Child Protec\u00ad tive Services are aaministered at the state level in 32 states, including Illinois. In the, 18 remaining states, such services are administered by county or local agencies but are supervi~ed by the state. Two of the states we visited, Florida and Michigan, have state-administered programs, while the remaining five have county\u00ad administered programs. We concentrated more, heavily on stCi.tes with county administration\"to find out whether placing responsi\u00ad bility at the lower governmental level would have ,any\" obvious benSfits app~icableto Illinois. rrhere 'Vlere, a variety 'Of other reasons for selecting these states as well, such as a specific progz:-am that we wanted to ex ... ,amine first-hand, or the nature of the child abuse problem in the ~tate., In C'alifornia, for example, we wanted to take a closer -373- Preceding page' blank look at the Child Sexual Abuse Treatment Center in Santa Clara County. In Virginia and Colorado we wanted to examine the wide\u00ad spread, and ap~arently successful, employment of n;ultidisciplinary teams to,coord1nate th7 response to child abuse by the wide range of agenc1es that corne 1n contact with the problem. Traveling to Colorado all~we~ us to meet with officials of both the American Humane Assoc1at1on and the National Center for the Prevention and Treatme~t of C~ild Abuse and Neglect. And New York~s system was of part1cular 1nterest to us because the Illinois statute, as well as one of the model statutes, was drawn from that State's law. We approached this part of our investigation with caution h~wever. M~king,c~mpa7i~ons between states has many limitatio~s s1nce, desp1te s1m1lar1t1es, no two state systems are identical. In fact, there ar7 many differences, sometimes vast differences, between states: 1n the legal authority of dif.ferent agencies, the way state and lo~al governments are structured, funding levels, re\u00ad sources! ~0~ulat10n p~tterns, the scope of the problem, and the way respons1b111ty ~or Ch1ld protection is parcelled out within and am~ng the a~enc1es that address the problem. A program that works qU1te wel~ 1n one s~a~e may be a total failure if simply trans\u00adplanted w1thout mod1f1cation to another. ~ons7quently, while we tried to learn about the structural organ1zat10n ~f the agencies we visited to better understand the cont7xt of ch11d protection activities, our overriding interest ~as 1n how each state has resolved, or failed to resolve, specific 1ssu7s,that any system that deals with child abuse must address. ~pec1f1ca~ly, we looked at the following nine elements that exist 1n any ch1ld protection system: definition of child abuse and ~eglect, identification of abused and neglected children, report- 1ng of ~uspected ab';Ise, record keeping, investigation, initial in\u00ad terven~10n\"e~aluat10n, formal intervention, monitoring, and ulti\u00ad mate d1spos1t10n of abuse and neglect cases. 1. Legislative Definitions of Child Abuse and Neglect , As has already been me~t~o~ed elsewhere in this report, there 1S no commonly accepted def1n1t1on of child abuse and neglect. Most P70ple p~ssess a common-sense understanding of what child abuse 1~ and 1~ not, but the understanding is so imprecise as to rende71t mean1ngless,for purposes of enforcement by government agenc1es. The follow1ng example of a definition that would be .. accepted by most people is offered by Brian Fraser: \"In the sim\u00ad plest ~f terms, it [child abuse] damage to a child for which t~ere 1S nO,reasonable explanation. Child abuse is usually not a s:-ngle phY~1cal ~ttack or a single act of molesta'i:ion or depriva\u00ad t10n., It 1S tYP1cally a pattern of behavior. Its effects are cu\u00ad mulat1ve. The longer it continues, the more serious the damage.1I The l7gislatur7s in all 50 states had to begin with a similar understand1ng ~f ch1ld abuse ~nd then translate it 1n a consistent manner. They.had to descr7be spec1f1cally both the nature of the, IIdamage,\" as well as the ~1rcumsta~ces of the IIdamage,lI which, in combination, would be cons1dered ch1ld abuse. -374-Although statutory language is different in every state, there are many similarities, if not in the wording, at least in the ap\u00ad plication to actual cases. The seven states we visited were no exception. All seven consider physical harm by other than acci\u00ad dental means to be child abuse, and all in SOIne manner attempt to exclude reasonable parental discipline. All of the states we visit\u00ad ed also include (directly or indirectly) sexual assault or abuse in the definition. Failure to protect a child from harm is again included as neglect in a 1.-1 , seven states. Finally, all but Colorado incorporate mental or emotional abuse into the statute. With the exception of Colorado, all of the states have what would be considered very broad definitions of child abuse. Colo\u00ad rado limits the definition to incidents or circumstances IIwhich seriously threaten the health or welfare of a child [emphasis added] ,II while the other six define abuse simply as' \"harm. II The broader definition allows for greater potentia.l interven\u00ad tion by government authorities, at least during the initial in\u00ad vestigation stage (which will be discussed further). In applica\u00ad tion this may not be the case, since those states with broad definitions, according to the officials we interviewed in the var\u00ad ious states, tend to screen calls more thoroughly prior to ini\u00ad tiating an investigation. In fact, initial screening is favored by the American Humane Association~ According to Larry Brown, Director of the Child Protection Division of the American Humane Association, the intake worker who answers the phone is the most crucial person in the syst7m. He should be highly trained and be able to speak at length w1th the caller to determine whether a field investigation is neces\u00ad sary. Brown felt that the intake worker should be able to use his or her discretion in screening calls, even using subjective screen\u00ad ing criteria based on the person's experience. He was critical of the Iowa and Colorado systems, which require field investigations of all allegations, and of the Illinois system, which uses the following substantive screening guidelines: 1) there must be a specific circumstance of harm or expectation of harm, and 2). the involvement of the caretaker in the harm or expected harm must be described. Without screening by professionals, valuable resources are wasted on unnecessary field investigations. According to Brown, lIyou can have professional peQple make responsible decisions.1I He adfultted that there will be mistakes, but emphasized that no system is perfect. In contrast to thils position, Karen Beye of the Colorado De\u00ad partment of Social Services told us that the child protection worker will be dispatched to investigate every allegation of abuse, IIno matter how shak:ip the call. II -' 1f the seven states we visited are representative of all states v the broad definition in combinat:i.on with subjective screening by in- -375-au Q$ , JQ take workers is the preferred approach. This does not necessarily mean it is the best, however. 2. Identification Before child protection service workers can intervene to pro\u00ad tect a child from harm, they have to be aware that a child is in danger. The problem has to be identified by someone and reported to the proper authorities. According to a 1976 national study done by the American Humane Association, approximately 40% of cases are identified by a friend, neighbor, relative, parent or parent substitute, a sibling or the victim himself (see Table,,8-1). These people are generally in the best position to observe abuse or neglect first-hand. Other re\u00ad porters (e.g., police, teachers, or doctors) usually can report only on the basis of after effects of abuse, such as injuries or behavioral change in an abused child. Because child protective workers must rely on others to iden\u00adtify possible abuse, improving the ability of people to recognize abuse as well as prcu.oting the willingness of people to report be\u00ad come major goals of any child protection agency. Though it is so crucial to effective child abuse intervention efforts, no state that we visited had a comprehensive strategy to improve identification. Most efforts were piecemeal and limited to public awareness campaigns that focused on the existence of child abuse r.ather than how to identify it, or were limited to occasional training grants geared toward selected subgroups of professionals, such as teachers. Without exception, officials reported that more cases of abuse could be detected earlier if more people knew what to look for and what questions to ask. Oftentimes cases are over'\u00ad looked simply because abuse is not even considered a possibility. We found one unique program to identify abuse and neglect in Minnesota. Paul Spears of the Minnesota Department 6f Public Wel\u00ad fare told one of our investigators that every medical assistance report involving services rendered to a child is reviewed to de~ tect possible unreported cases of child abuse. Spears said that the request for reimbursement contains a description of injuries or a list of the symptoms and diagnosis. If the case appears to involve possible abuse or neglect based on the description, a letter will be sent to the doctor reminding him of his child abuse ~eport\u00ad ing responsibilities. Spears could not supply us with any informa\u00ad tion regarding the success of this program. However, he said that the Department frequently receives hostile letters from physicians who are upset that their diagnoses have been questioned. 3. Reporting Although the tot~i number of reported ca~\u20acs of child abuse has increased since the 'first reporting statute was adopted 20 years ago, it is widely believed that most cases of child abuse still go unreported. To reduce the number of undetected cases, every state has enacted legislation requiring certain professionals to report -376-! ; I I i J Table 8-1 SOURCE OF INITIAL REPORTS -ALL 1 2 3 4 5 ~ 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 // PERCENTAGES From American Humane Association. National Analysis of Official .Child Neglect and Abuse Reportings : An -f suspected child abuse to the agency designated by law to receive s~ch reports. These statutes generally include immunity provi\u00ad s~ons for reports made in good faith; civil or criminal sanctions for failure to,r~port; and, usua~ly, ~brogation of doctor/patient and other spec~f~c types of conf~dent~ality privileges. The language of these reporting statutes varies significantly fr~rn state to state. Nevertheless, the group of professionals re\u00ad qu~red to report--Iaw enforcement personnel, doctors nurses edu- t ' , , ca ors, soc~al workers, and so on--are similar. , ,Tl;e ,statutes were passed to overcome the unwillingness, or ~nab~l~ty due to confidentiality requirements, of many professionals t~ report ~uspected abuse or neglect. To the extent that profes\u00ad s~onals fa~led to report because of confidentiality or a fear of being sued., the reporting statutes have been successful. However according to officials in all seven states we visited, the threat~ ened sanctions are totally ineffective in overcoming the profes\u00ad sionals' unwillingness to report because they do not trust the sys\u00ad tem or ~ecause they do not want to inconvenience themselves by be\u00ad coming ~nvolved. The law is almost impossible to enforce. Robert J. Masterson, Deputy District Attorney of Santa Clara County i~ California, told our investigators that his office vigor\u00ad ously tr~es to enforce the mandatory reporting statute, but without much,s~ccess. He,s~id the District Attorney has prosecuted three phys~c~ans for fa~l~ng to report. None of them was convicted. Similar stories were told to us in other states. About the only time prosecutions are successful is when there is a confes\u00ad s~on of child abuse that the professional does not pass on to the proper authorities, and an eyewitness to the confession does re\u00ad port it. These occasi~ns are extremely rare. Recommendations for bolstering the confidence of those-profes\u00ad sionals who fail t~ report because they do not trust the system are the source of one.of the most hotly debated issues in the child pr~tection field: recommendations about what agency should re\u00ad ce~ve reports of suspected child abuse. Essentially, states have directed that reports of child abuse be made either to a s09ial service agency, a law enforcement agency, or both. For\" the last several years, there has been a nationwide campaign underway to remove law enforcement agencies from the pic\u00ad ture, except in the most extreme cases. The effort has been based in,part on the theory that many professionals and private citizens al~ke are often reluctant to report their spspicions of abuse for fear that it will lead to punitive and destructive intervention by the police. - We,f&tind no solid evidence to support this theory, either in our rev~ew of relevant literature pr in our visits to other .. states. In three of the states--Colorado, California, and Minnesota--re~ ports are rec~ived by either a social work agency or the police. -378-'\\ .\\ \\ h' , -:rL--\"e\u00a7;e agenc~es are then requ~red to exchange reports. In the re- maining states, the reports are received by a social services agency, which in turn notifies police only if the case meets certain sever\u00adity standards established by law, rule, or regulation. Although we have no quantitative data, our impression is that willingness to report is related more to the perceived effective\u00ad ness of the overall system thanto who receives the report. Satis\u00ad faction with the overall system, and thus greater respect for the system, seemed to be higher in Minnesota, Colorado, Virginia, and Michigan than in theothe~ three states we visited. Officials in the former states still reported some problems in overcoming the unwillingness of some people to report, but they were more posi\u00ad tive in their statements of progress. The important factor in these states is not who receives reports. Rather, it seems to be the widespread use of multidisciplinary teams, made up of police, state's attorneys, mental health workers, physicians, nurses, and educators in addition .to social workers--representatives of all groups of mandated reporters--to review and monitor child abuse cases. The other three states make use of multidisciplinary teams much less and more sporadically; when used they are generally much less representative of community professionals. Even in these 'states, officials reported greater satisfaction and fewer problems in areas that make use of broadly based multidisciplinary teams, or where close cooperation existed among the many professionals who came in contact with child abuse, including law enforcement personnel. 4. Record Keeping Most states now make use of statewide central registers to record all reported cases of child abuse. The register in some states is manual; in most it is computerized. The purpof',e of these registers is generally to assist\u00b7the responsible authorities in diagnosing and monitoring individual cases of abuse, as well as to provide a means to statistically assess the probl.em on a state\u00ad wide level. All states that use central registers must, by federal law, take measures to ensure the confidentiality of the informa\u00ad tion contained in them. Generally speaking, a person who suspects child abuse can re\u00ad port directly to the central register, to the responsible local authority, or to the police. No matter who receives the report, it eventually should be forwarded to the central register, within a specified period. While mOS,t authorities in the field agree with the concept behind, and the stated purpose of, central registers, these same authorities have also been quite critical of their actual opera\u00ad tion. Douglas Besb,arov,for example, a proponent of properly operate~ central registers, st~tes in his 1977 article \"Putting Central,. Registe'rs to Work,\" that:' -379-,,' , nothing is so striking as the failure of almost all exist\u00ad ing central register systems to fulfill their stated diagnostic, monitoring and statistical functions In their present condition, all but a few registers are unused and unusable. ~e records in them are grievously incomplete, inaccurate and out-of-date, making the central register a largely ignored appendage of the state's child protection system, one whose existence no one can easily justify. Central registers have also been the subjects of controversy due to privacy issues. Some authorities believe that the mere ex\u00ad istence of central record keeping is an invasion of privacy. In most commentaries we reviewed, however, the concern focused on the inaccuracies that plague almost all central registers, primarily the problem of recording, and later failing to expunge, allegations that prove false. Furthermore, privacy concerns are the source of heated arguments over who should have access to the information. During our site visits, we confirmed that many problems re\u00ad ferenced by Besharov and others are still present;. Minnesota was the only state that did not have a central register; but all of the other states c'omplained that a large percentage of reports re\u00ad ceived by the proper agency are not passed on to the central ~egis\u00adter. Also; many workers are remiss in forwarding follow~up infor\u00ad mation. Because of manpower shortages, Colorado officials told us there can be several weeks' delay in getting information entered into the central register even when reports are properly referred to them. And in Florida, where the central register is manual and is used for a variety of other purposes besides keeping track of child abuse cases, we were told that many gaps and inaccuracies are reflected in the files. Despite the'se problems, officials in ~11 of the states we ,t visited said the deficiencies are gradually being worked out and exp:ressed the belief that central registers are useful. Some in\u00ad formation, evep if the accuracy and completeness is suspect and thus has to be double-checked, is better than none. On the other hand, we did not find anyone who believed that a significantly im\u00ad proved ceiltral register would lead to major improvements in the quality of child protection. Furthermore, we did not find that the inaccuracies in, or the very existence of, central registers were burning issues among the people we interviewed. In most states the central registers are maintained \"by a state social service agency. In Minnesota, which has' no central register, the social service agency in each county maintains central fllese In California, the Department of Justice maihtains the only state\u00ad wide central file of child abuse reports. This was the b~,ly state where only law enforcement authorities have access t.O information contained in it. Generally, all\"other states allow access to at least social service agency staff. Most allow at leas't limited access to medical personnel and police as well. However, Virginia does not without a 'court order. -380-i I 5. Investigation/Initial Intervention As mentioned above, one of the most controversial issues in the field of child protection centers on who should receive reports of suspected abuse or neglect. Part of that dispute is tied to the controversy over who should con:uct the initial investigation of child abuse allegations. Simply stated, those on one side of the issue view child. abuse as asocial problem and therefore be\u00ad lieve allegations of abuse should be reported to and investigated by social workers. Those on the other side view child abuse as a crime and insist that the police should investigate reports just as they would any other allegation of criminal wrongdoing. Brian Fraser outlines the position of the two groups as follows: Proponents of Police departments as the receiving agency argue that child abuse in serious cases is a crime. and that 'the police are available twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week. Furthermore, the proponents argue that people are accustomed to reporting acts of violence to the police and that police have the unilateral right to enter a home without court permission if they believe that a child is in imminent danger. Opponents, on the other hand , argue that once the parents have been arrested and charged with a 'crime, it is very unlikely that they will co\u00ad operate with the Department of Social Services and begin volun\u00ad tary treatment. Furthermore, a successful conviction for child abuse in the criminal court is rare ana even if a prosecution is successful, it only addresses the need for retribution and not the issue of treatment. Opponents to police departments being the repository of reports of child abuse also argue that child abuse is a very complex problem and police officers do not have the necessary expertise and training to deal with it. Also, the police are viewed as a punitive agency and this punitive ambience will inhibit abusive parents from seeking help. Op\u00ad ponents also argue that police are not viewed with respect by the other agencies and it is unlikely that a police department would be able to develpp a cooperative approach. Fraser also mentions that some commentators have suggested that the juvenile court receive and investigate allegations of child abuse. The primary arguments against the court's involve\u00ad ment in the investigation are that it is already overburdened with cases and that it is also viewed as a punitive agency like the police. Fraser then goes on to offer his own position.as follows: Over .the past fe~ years the majority of commentators and the majority of states have isolated the Department of Social Ser\u00ad vices as the most appropriate agency to receive and investigate reports of suspected child abuse. They argue convincingly that to prevent child abuse from recurring, it is necessary to provide treatment and the Department of Social Services is uni~~ly quali-. fiea to pro~ide that treatment. Furthermore, personnel in the Department of Social Services are ,the best trained and the best qualified to. handle these cases. \"Also, the local department is (, .viewed as being non-punitive. They are likely to obtain the -381-FA CO; .+ ~------~----------------- necessary cooperation from parents to make treatment successful. The Department of Social Services also is the agency most likely to be able to develop cooperation with other agencies and pro\u00ad fessionals. The Department of Social Services can provide treatment in addition to the receipt and the investigation of reports and, in many cases, the Department is already involved with the parents and the child and can intervene before serious injury is inflicted. There are critics of the Department of Social Services, but when all the factors are weighed it is apparent that the Department is the most appropriate agency to receive and investigate reports of child abuse Many of the relevant articles~~e reviewed agreed with Fraser's position. Our field interviews rev~aled added depth to this issue. It is not clear, as Fraser and others suggest, \"that the Department of Social Services is the most appropriate agency to receive and investig'ate reports of child abuse.\" Furthermore, we learned that the issue is not simply one of either police or social workers re\u00ad ceiving reports. Almost everyone we talked to believed that law en\u00ad forcement should conduct the initial investigation in at least severe cases of abuse or neglect. For example, Larry Brown of the American Humane Association, an agency that is strongly behind therapeutic intervention in child abuse cases, told our investiga\u00ad tors that law enforcement should be included at the initial stage when the social worker's life might be in danger, when child abu.se is taking place at that moment, when a child must be removed, and when a severe crime has been committed and evidence must be gathered immediately. Nevertheless, it was Brown's opinion that child abuse is not\u00b7 a criminal problem, explaining that if cases wind up in court it is usually juvenile court. Therefore, the police, who tend to ~ook for evidence leading toward criminal action, are' not needed 1.n 80 ': percent 6f the cases. In most cases, Brown said, the way to pro\u00ad ceed is not to put the abuser in jail. Social ~70rkers should con\u00ad tact the suspected abuser and should establish a therapeutic atmos\u00ad phere from the beginning by telling the family that they are theFe to help. Everyone we interviewed felt that law enforcement should be involved in certain cases of child abuse and neglect. Likewise, everyone we inter\u00b7viewed agreed that there are some cases of minor abuse or neglect in which law enforc.eme:nt authori\u00ad ties need not become involved. Most police departments already have more than enough demands placed on their resources. Opinion was divided over whether or not a law I3nfol:'cement presence would be detri~ental to the successful handling of less serious child abuse cases. The heart of the issue seems not to be if ~,aw ~.nforcement should be involved, but who decides when they will,-and whether or not the mere presence of police has a negative impact on any possible re\u00ad habilitation efforts. In those states w~ere police must be advised of all child abuse reponts, agreements have generally been worked out between law enforcement agencies and \"social service agencies -382-I n .. t '.~ f ',../ , t6, 1 '! I that provide for a pre screening of cases. Those that appear less serious will be handled by the social worker, while those that ap\u00ad pear more serious will be handled by police. These agreements also generally provide that the findings of the initial in~estigation will be reported to the other agency. In Jefferson County, Colorado, a police officer'in plain clothes accompanies a social wor:ker on every 'investigation. The social worker takes the lead on less serious cases, while the police officer handles those in which criminal action might be warranted. The officials we interviewed in Jefferson County reported a high degree of satisfac\u00adtion with this arrangement. Jackie Howell of the Los Angeles Police Department a.nd Sgt. Carole Paint~r of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department are strong advocates of police involvement in child abuse cases. They point out that there is no difference between child abuse and as\u00ad sault, and they observed that the social workers in the Los Angeles area have begun to realize that law enforcement and the courts are helpful in treatment. Often an abusive parent might be helped by treatment but will not voluntarily go along with treatment recom\u00ad menda tions T.he courts provide the incentive. The officers added that social workers are not trained to take formal statements, make advisements of legal rights, or collect and pre\u00ad serve evidence. \"When you take kids out of their home,\" said Painter, \"you better be able to do that.\" Even in Juvenile Court proceed\u00ad ings the case has to be properly documented, they stressed In states where, police are not required to be advised of child abuse reports, these cooperative agreements also exist, al\u00b7though to a lesser extent. In Nassau County, N. Y., for example, the police and county social service agency reported a good working relation\u00ad ship and strong commitment to cooperation. However, in Albany County, the District Attorney had to force the county social ser\u00ad vice agency to enter into an agreement to notify him of the more severe kinds of cases. The agreement was prompted after two chil\u00ad dren had died fOllowing separate instances of repeated abuse con\u00ad tinuing over a period of 18 to 24 months. The social workers in these cases never advised the police or the District Attorney's office until th~ deaths of the children, preferring instead to handle the cases themselves without law enforcement or court inter\u00ad vention. Contrary to tJle views of some comment_~tors, we could find no evidence during our visits to other states' that police involvement per se is detrimenta\u00b7l. To be sure, some authorities provided ex\u00ad amples of police who investigated cases of abuse in an insensitive and incompetent way. But we were also provided examples of social workers who han~Ued investigations just as poorly. \" , More important, we were given 'scores of examples of skilled\u00b7 intervention by both police and social workers. The crucial ele\u00ad ment to successful investigations was proper training for both the -383------------------------ ~----------- police and the social worker, according to those we interviewed. A critical factor in the success of a child protection program ap\u00ad pears to be strong cooperation between the police department and the social service agency. We have seen first-hand that such training and cooperation are possible. Whoever responds to the report of child abuse, the purpose of the investigation cannot be considered, first and foremost, to be the establishment of a therapeutic relationship with the family, or to put the offender in jail, or even to protect the child. These purposes presuppose that a child has been abused and that there is evidence already on hand to prove it. The fact is that a large percentage of reports are unfounded. In Michigan, for example, we were told that 50% of the reports called in later prove to be false. Consequently, the first thing that must be determined is whether or not an incident occurred or. a condition exists that warrants further government intervention. Unless proper grounds can be established, there is no reason to attempt establishing a therapeutic relation\u00ad ship, and there is certainly no justification to put someone in jailor to take any other action to protect a child. Even if abuse is indicated, unless the person who responds properly documents the facts, any immediate action taken will be reve:r-sed by the courts, rendering futile all previous efforts. ., In serious cases of child abuse, a social worker is clearly not the proper person to conduct the initial investigation. The police should do it with or without a social worker. On the other hand, there appears to be no com:gelling rea- son for the police to become involved in the least serious cases. For those cases that fall in between, it appears that either a properly trained police officer or a social worker (or both) could conduct the initial investigation. Since it is frequently not known whether an allegation is even true, much less in which cate\u00ad gory ~ case would fall until after the initial contact, it appe~rs 0 crucial that cooperative agreements be worked out between law eri~ forcement officials and sqcial service authorities in advance as to who should respond. This lfilay mean~,th~.t police should investigate many more reports than, upbn further inquiry, the circumstances might really demand. .. . 6. Evaluation, Formal Intervention, Monitoring and Ultimate Disposition Because of the limited time available to us during our out-of\u00ad state trips, we were unable to construct a complete picture of these last four elements of the child protection system in each state. There is not always a clear distinction where one stage ends and ano.ther begins. The process can move,. from evaluation to ultimate. disposition within a few days or be extended over several years. There are so many options. at each of these later stages, even with\u00ad in a single state, that a comparative diSCUSsion of each stage separately could be more confusing than enlightening. One problem seems to be universal. Too many cases that come into the system remain too long without satisfactory resolution, according to the officials we interviewed. This tends to over~oad -384-t .. /' ,. ~ J a I \u00a7 :~ i I ~ ~ r f t J ,[ !~ f\u00b7 1 t b ~ f\u00b7 ,. i 1 , ~ <l t the entire system ~nd to reduce its effectiveness throughout. Re\u00ad sources for assess1ng or evaluating cases, for temporary and per\u00ad manent place~ent of children, for treating the abused as well as the abuser: and fo: mo~itoring progress on cases are strained beyond the ~yste~ s capac1ty 1n eve:y state we visited. Although this stra1n 7x1sts,at every step 1n the process, the problem is most ap\u00ad parent 1n these later stages, beginning with evaluation. Evaluation, or assessment, overlaps with the initial investi\u00ad g~tioQ. After it is determined that a report is founded, the offi\u00ad c1al on the scene must decide whether or not to take the child into temporary custody for his own safety, and whether immediate crimi\u00ad nal ac~ion.is,war:a~ted by the circumstances. Taking custody of the ch1ld 1S ]ust1f1ed only when there is cause to believe the child is in immediate danger, and an immediate arrest is usually war:a~ted o~ly in ~eve:e,cases. A decision on whether to proceed adm1n1strat1vel\u00a5, 1n c1v1l court, or in criminal court can usually be deferred unt1l later, as long as the facts are properly obtained and documented, and any evidence is gathered and protected. The availability of temporary placement facilities and the backlog in both civil .and criminal court are factors that are taken into conside.ration at t~is point. ~he decision is not based purely on the danger to the ch1ld or on eVl.dence that.a crime has been committed, according to many we interviewed. Resource, limitations s7riou~ly aff7ct t,he 9uali ty of the initial assessment of the family s1tuat10n, wh1ch 1S 1mportant for the preparation of a treatment plan. A~ter the evaluation stage, the process becomes utterly con\u00ad fused 1n several of,the states we visited. Theoretically, the na\u00ad ture of the formal 1ntervention should be based on the assessment a~d the treatment plan. However, if criminal charges have been f~led, th~ process easily splits between actions taken by the so\u00ad c1al serv1ce~ agency and actions in criminal court. In those states or areas of states where there is strong cooperation between law enforc~ment and social services, this split tends not to occur. Tho~e areas that make use of broad-based multidisciplinary teams to rev~ew cases of a,buse have, by far, more success in keeping all act10ns--whether administrative, civil, criminal, or a combination-\u00ad coordinated and focused toward a common goal. They tend to be able to b:ing more professionals into the overall treatment picture, in\u00ad clud1ng teachers, school social workers, family doctors, and others. The need to have intervention focused toward a common goal in child abuse cases has been widely recognized as vi tal for\u00b7 many years. Indeed, this is. the primary reason for designating a single agency, uSll~lly a social service ag~ncy, to be responsible to over\u00ad see the entfre process. In some states we visited, this oversight re~ponsibill.~y has been inte;rpreted to, mean total control. The eV1dence see~s overwhelming that in some states, social service pr<?fessional~\\have made c:onscious efforts to con,ceal incidents of ch11d abuse~rom the po11ce and prosecutors to maintain control of cases at th7 formal intervention stage. , . still, many cases of abuse are going to come to the Gttention of police and prosecutors regardless, since social services and law enforcement have overlapping jurisdiction in most cases. If cooperation does not precede this, law enforcement officials tend .. , not to have much regard for the suggestions of the social workers in the case. An at.'llosphere of mutual hostility is thus established and becomes self-perpetuating. The ultimate loser is the child the system is supposed to protect. within a few months after formal intervention, the responsi\u00ad bility for monitoring cases generally becomes the sole responsi\u00ad bility of the social worker. Where applicable, the court ~~d/or a multidisciplinary team also reviews the case at extended ~nter-::\u00ad valse If the case cannot be brought to a satisfactory resolution quickly, it tends to ling~r in the system for years with~ut much direct oversight by any government agency. Usually a pr~vate agency takes over responsibility by default. The situation in Illinois is similar, but a child need not languish in the system until he or she is 21.\u00b7. Not every case is disposed in the manner described above. '!uvenile Cour.ts maintain a guardianship calendar that contains notat~ons concern~ng the cases of each ward of the state of Illinois. These case files are re\u00ad viewed periodically, usually every six months. Not onl~ does a guardian ad litem, an assistant state's attorn7y, or a Jud97 have the opportunity during these reviews to determ~ne that a ch~ld ~an be released from involvement with the system, but such a determ~na\u00ad tion can be made anytime between these six-month reviews. All too often, unfortunately, these cases are simply con\u00ad tinued until the next six-month review. A judge may decide that if,) a DCFS worker does not appear in court to present arguments for a child to be released from the Department's care, no such reason exists... And judges are too busy too review all of the 27, 000+ cl~ses maintained by DCFS. <) Children who are 'victims of abuse or neglect may not have 'to enter the labyrinthine DCFS sytem. Somet~mes a.worker wi~l try to divert a child from the system, and somet~mes the worker ~s suc\u00ad .cessful. Many cases are disposed of \"without delay. Those that remain in the system generally have been handled poorly, slowly, or involve multiple accusations of abuse. The system reflects those involved within it. If all case\u00ad workers, ,. judges, and others had more manageable numbers of cases and perfor:med appropriate review of those cases, the system would of course be better. In Illinois, and in. other sta,tes, tc:;>o ~any\", children do remain part of the system unt~l they reach maJor~ty. B. ., Multidisciplinary Child Protection Team~ ,. ' 'The \u00a3requencyof of all kinds and in par\u00ad ticular the batteri.ng of children and women are social phenomena '.' that the ordinary citizen finds hard to understand.

The report of an inquiry into the death by starvation of a baby boy who weighed only 4.5 kilograms at 16 months has therefore caused great dis\u00ad quiet since it revealed a disastrous breakdown in communications between various people involved in trying to offer help. The family doctor treating the child's mother for depression did not know that a health visitor attached to his own practice had been called in to see her son I and in her turn the health visitor, unaware of any urgency concerning the baby's condition, did not report the fact that the mother had twice denied her access to the boy. The senior social worker involved did not recognize the danger signs and failed to call a case c;:;nference I and an inspector o\u00a3 the National Association \u00a3or the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, called in by a neighbor when she was worried about the child, did not call \u00a3or\" three days and never gained admission to the home in spite of 13 attempts--but never told anyone else of his involvement in the case. --John Lister, M.D. New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 294, No. 13 The case me~tioned above illustrates how a number of trained professionals can be assigned to a caSe and still fail to protect a child from abuse and, in this case, death. Social workers and others involved with the protection of children have struggled to find ways to coordinate efforts better, to provide professional case conSUltation when needed, and to integrate the various roles played by the same professionals in protecting the health and lives of children. One answer to fragmented and confused services is the mul'ti\u00ad disciplinary, or interdisciplinary, team concept. The idea behind the use Q,f such a team is simple enough: it merely involves get\u00ad ting representatives o~ all of the agencies and groups involved with child protection to meet on a regular basis as a team--hence the title, multidisciplinary team (or M-D team). Beyond this simple idea, however, are many varieties of structure, composition, and use. Most such teams consist of\" at least one social worker, a hospital representative, and a representative from the judicial system. That list, though, represents the bare minimum of pro\u00ad fessionals who might be involved with a team. There are so many tYPes of teams it is difficult to describe them, either by function or composition. Some are mandated by state law and consist of representatives of the state department of child welfare, together with other professionals. The list of professionals can be extremely longi it can include police offi\u00ad cers, attorneyS;-doctors, nurses, judges, social workers from both tne public and pri va te sectors, cOJlnselors, '.' homemakers, and volunteers. Some M-D teams add interested citizens from the com\u00ad munity to balance the team and give it more range of composi,tion. Some teams are organiz~d according to the sta,te,child welfare sys- -387-\" tem. Others are organized along county or community lines. Some are strictly volunteer; others consist of professionals paid for their participation on the teams. Some staff individual cases; others are available to consult on a case that has presented par\u00ad ticular problems. Others might develop rules and strategies for coordination of services that then are applied, theoretically, to all cases coming into the child protective system. ., In Illinois, DCFS is mandated to establish M-D teams for staff\u00ad ing cases \"to the fullest extent feasible.\"\" (Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 23, \u00abJ[ 2057.1.) They can be composed of any professionals or others who seem to be able to cast light on problematic cases. The Com\u00ad mission looked into the value of M-D teams both in Illinois and in other states tQ) see if they might help child protection in Illinois. We reviewed the practices of teams in other states. We examined several different models. We attended conferences in which the very issue of the value of such teams was discussed~ Finally, we reviewed the literature that has treated the composition and ac\u00ad tual practical use of these teams. This section of the report will reflect what we found through an analysis of the maze of different teams that exist or have been considered for implementation. 1. Information from Interviews Certainly not all of those with whom we spoke felt that M-D teams represented the most useful or innovative concept to come along. One of the detractors of the concept of the'M-D team is John Forrest Lewis, a Program Specialist for the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect. Lewis offered one of our investigators some definite comments about M-D teams: he told us that the idea looks good on paper but: is fraught with shortcomings. Lewis said that the use of M-D teams in Colorado had been successfu~~--.\\~ut he still felt that it was but one of many useful models for.\" (1.ld protection. Lewis felt it impractical to expect pr~fess\\~~j~a~s to devote much time and effort to these teams. .. It was more 11.kely, he felt, that along with the skilled teams come all of the pro\u00ad fessional jealousies that exist anyway, just adding to disruption in the system and on individual cases. Lewis felt,~hat.often the social worker would be c~owded out, even though the soc1.al worker should know the subject best. Ley!is told us that, in his exper\u00ad ience, professionals lost interest ~n teC).rns and. began to sen~ . . others their places at meet1.ngs, effect1.vely contrad1.ct1.ng the pUI::pose for establishing a team to begin with. Eventually, the team members know nothing about the, cases that they are supposed to staff. Eventually, according to Lewis' gloomy prognostications, interest wanes and the team f:i,.~ds itself fo~lowing the recommenda\u00ad tions that a caseworker can make alone. Lewis qualified his remarks by saying that he.felt M-D teams could be useful, to a degree, in smaller cities and in rural areas.~ where the professionals probably would know each other anyway. He did not think that these teams could be of value in larger metro\u00ad poli tan areas. Lewis commented that ,cohesic:>TI i~ ~Ieces~ary. for such. a team to function properly, and that cohes1.on 1.S lack1.ng 1.n densely populated '. areas. -388-As a matter of fact, a Commission investigator sat in on a meeting of the Adams County Multidisciplinary Review Team on Child Abuse in Colorado to determine the effectiveness of just such a team. Colorado state law provides for each county to have such a review team; further, it provides that every report of child abuse be analyzed. ~he meeting itself is handled in two parts: the first brings together a team leader from the Adams County So\u00ad cial Services Department, an attorney f.rom the District Attorney' s Office, and a public health nurse. The second session consists of a meeting with these three people, but joined by representatives of several other agencies and disciplines. j, Irt the meeting that our investigator attended, the public health nurse was not present. A social worker and an attorney read through each case and discussed anything problematiC:. Each case was presented with caseworker comments and recommendations. At this first meeting stage, the decision would be made to accept the caseworker's recommendation, make a minor change, or refer the case to the larger group for further discussion and review. Of the 30 cases that the small group examined, about half were held over for further review by the larger team. The larger team would examine significant issues regarding the handling of the case in addition to making new recommendations, if needed. The team would ascertain that the police had been notified as required, the amount of time the. social work investigation took, and similar issues. During 'the larger mee~cing that we attended, it was determined. that one police departmeht or unit had not been reporting cases of abuse as required. The police representative of the team decided to call the appropriate youth officer in the other unit to find out what the problem was. Other specific cases were analyzed in detail. Questions were raised about the appropriateness of behavior by day care operators and in group homes. In one case, the representative of the county mental health department recognized a family name, so' the decision on the case was deferred until the next meeting the,. following week to bring in additior~al information. In still another case, it was pointed out that a 13-year-old was in charge of his siblings for several hours each week~ The team determined that there did not appear to be a role for the state in the case, but 0Ile of th~ team members menotioned that there was an afternoon program for ch1.1dren at a nearby park that might be appropriate for the.se children. So even though this last case involved neither abuse nor actual ne\u00ad glect, a solution was proposed to a familial problem. Our investigator determined from the meetings, conversations, and a review of fact sheets th~t this team was review-oriented rather than treatment-oriented, as hospital-based teams usually .are. The review process allowed individual cases to be discussed, assessments to be modifl.ed if necessary, and inter-d'epartmental communication to be fostered, which might not have. occurred other\u00ad wise. We will inc.lude\u00b7 below , , \\ I \\ The MRT serves in an advisory capacity to the county Department of Social Services and is under its auspices. The Team is re\u00ad quired to review the files and other records of a case, includ\u00ad ing the diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment services being offered to the family in connection with the reported abuse, and makes reports to the county department with suggestions for further action. The public is ,permitted to attend those por\u00ad tions of the team meetings where the mandatory discussions of public and private <;:lgencies\" responses are evaluated and to hear the recommendations regarding these responses if they were. not timely, adequate, and in compliance with the law. In addition to review, the Team plays a supportive role to the Social Services staff and Can help share \"t.he burden of responsi-,. bility in making decisions regarding filing court action, re\u00ad moval and return of children, and general case plan..ning. The Team also identifies systems issues when breakdowns occur and advises the Depar\"tment in ways to educate other agencies and professionals in the community regarding the Child Protection Act and procedures for reporting and completing \"investigations. The Team provides feedback or comments on case presentations by making recommendations and suggestions. When recommenda\u00ad tions are given\" the worker is required to carry out the action; when suggestions are made, the decision to carry the action out is left up to the worker and supervisor. In Illinois, former head of Cook County CPS Jeanine Smith commented on multidisciplinary teams when we interviewed her. She felt that DCFS needed consultants, not M-D teams. She stressed that someone had to be held, accountable for decisions and if the team made a wrong decision, the social worker would be held ac\u00ad countable .' An investigator men(;t<':1ned to Smith that we had heard the op\u00ad posite from team members, -including social workers, in Denver, when we visited that city. In fact, the social workers had told us that having teams pr~vented them from becoming scapegoats wheneve'r a poor or unfortunate decision was made. Smith still disagreed and main\u00ad tained that caseworkers would be held more accountable than other team members. She felt that the teams do have a: role;i.n providing ,consultation to caseworkers, but she strongly fe'lt that the deci\u00ad sion-making process was strictly in the, province of the caseworker q.nd the superv)ising caseworker. Commission staff also visited 'Michigan, where they 'talked with two members of the Child Abuse and Neglect Interdisciplinary Team,' Social Work Center, University of Michigan at Ann Arbore We spo~e with Kathleen Faller an~ Donald Duquette, ~ho told us that \"the \" team was begun at the University of Michigan in 1976 to help es\u00ad tablish a 'policy for treatment of child abuse. The team was es.,.. tablished to consist of professionals from the university's, Law, Medical, and Social Work Center schools. The team wa's set up in \"such a way that it would handle cases in treatmeI}t'to see i~ po- -390-I I I. I I, lice decisions made were really feasible and \"helpful. Finally, the team was to develop training programs for the Department of Social Services to provide aid to caseworkers. Both Faller and Duquette are teachers at the University of Michigan and admitted that their roles are more in teaching and training workers than in helping actual team workers to plan treat\u00ad ment for specific cases. As a result, theY/:We~e able to address such topics as training in more specific ,terms \"than, actual treat\u00ad ment provision. Both agreed that caseworkers did not receive agequate train\u00ad ing in Michigan. They felt that the lack of training contributed in large measure to caseworker burnout. They were concerned that workers were being sent into the field without proper training. Duquette said that fully half of all child abuse cases in Wayne County would end up in court, yet caseworkers are not trained con\u00ad cerning legal matters or procedures of the courts. I' Both also agreed that casework supervisors had often lost touch with what~t was like to handle .a case on the street. Often they had forgotten the demands of heavy caseloads and the emotional stress of the ~ob that caseworkers had to perform. Generally, they said that th~s, was a problem encountered throughout the public sec\u00adtor. Those who had become most removed from actual work on the streets were making policy that often had little to do with reality. They recommended. that caseworkers take a stronger role in actual policy-making. . Both Faller and Duquette talked briefly about interagency com\u00ad munication arid the t;eamwork concept. Their impression was that such communication and cqoperation was essential to planning and treat\u00ad ment of child abuse land neglect cases. As we have mention~d, M-D teams 9an take many forms and can come about in 'many different ways. An investigator spoke in 1981 with Scott Nemanich, Chief of the Ju~renileDivision, will County State s Attorney' s Office, in Jolie,t'~ Illinois. Nemanich told us that he had been with the Office for\" almost four years and had been head of the Juvenile Division for 18 months. He was brought in to' clean up a \"mess\" that existed with the handling of abuse and ne\u00ad glect cases. When he\" began work in Will County'~ he said that DCFS workers were at odds wi~h representatives of other.\u00b7 agencies and, consequently, little or nothing was being done to combat or treat child'abuse and neglect. , :s::'; I;. Neman1ch sa1d-\"that he formed what 1S called the Youth Action Council, a group composed of representatives of police departments, DCFS, Illinois Status Offender Se~vices (ISOS), Catholic Char;i.ties, the Will County Mental Health Department, and a few other interested agencies;, The groups met toge'ther on a reg~lar basis to develop policy and plans ~.or treatment and planning of child abuse cases. Nemanich said that everyone became very involved with the group and ttie overall reaction was very favorable. At, about this tim~, DCFS . -391-fA Qj g *4 administrators replaced the old Aurora Region A~ministrator with a new person, who was described by Nemanicp as JUs~ what \u00b7the :e:\u00ad gion needed to become aggressive in providing serV1.ces to fam1.l1.es. The new regional administrator, Les Townsend, conduc::ted a house\u00ad according \"trouble\u00ad makers\" within DCFS to leave. Because of Nemanich's interest in child abuse and ~is effo:ts in Will County, DCFS Director Coler appointed him to theStatew1.de Advisory Committee on Child Abuse a~d Neglect . Unfort~natel\u00a5, un\u00adlike the M-D team that he had devised, he descr1.bed ~h6\\\\ Comm1.,ttee as a failure because of Coler's refusal to consult w1.th members of the committee or to implement their plans. In 1980, as part of our investigation into child molestation and the response of the criminal justice system, ~e analyzed.a copy of a child abuse grant proposal to fund a Ch~ld ProteC~1.on Team 1.n Lake County, Illinois. The grant came about follow1.ng ~he implementation of a treatment-oriented team at Sb:. Th7rese Hosp1. tal in Waukegan (to which we will refer s~ortly) ,In bas1.c ~erms, the hospital program consisted of proiess1.onals from the med1.cal, legal, and sociological professions: they include~ a staff doctor, a _ hospital social worker \"or nurse, a DCFS soc1.al worker~ state's Attorney's Off1.ce. Fund1.ng from this grant. would employ one assistant state's attorney and a clerical person. The major responsibility of th~ team would be to organize teams similar to the one at st. Therese ~ at other hos\u00adpitals in Lake County. The grant would have prov1.ded funds ~o be utilized by DCES, after approval. The proposal we analyzed does not describe in narrative form the manner in which.the team member~ would interact, but does break out different funct1.ons and respons1.\u00adbilities for the different members of th~ team. The total.budget, which seems quite reasonable, was $38,423.59. Of course, 1.f the grant proved'successful, probably additional.fund~ng would be neces\u00ad sary to implement this program in every hosp1.tal 1.n Lake County. During that investigation', Commission staff interviewed Dr. Carlos J. puig,\" practitioner of emergency room care, me~7r of the Northern 1.llinois Emergency Physicians, and the phys1.c1.an ':ls\u00ad signed to the Lake County Child Protection T~am ~CPT). .Dr. ~U1.g was a member of the original team at St. Therese s Hosp1.tal 1.n Waukegan. Dr. Puig was critical of DCFS but felt that the ';lse of teams could alleviate some of the more obvious problems fac1.ng DCFS workers and administrators. Puig told us that the team began after Dennis Ryan, state's Attorn/5y of Lake County, read qbout a mul tidiscipl~nary program in Europe which :t;,ocused on three 7lements: det7rmini,;r;g if, child abuse had taken place; obtaining 1.nput from var1.OUS ~1.7lds an~ was indicated; . and prov7d1.ng adv1.ce from the team to the court. ,Ryan then conv1.nced Da~1.~KrOp~, then Director\u00b7 of the Lake Villa DCFS Office, to part1.c1.pate 1.n t~e program by assigning a social wo:-ker from D~FS to. the tea!? PU1.g mentioned that the team at the time of the 1.nterv1.e~ cons1.sted of (\\ . an assistant state's attorney, Puig, a social worker or a nurse fro~ the hospital, and Donald Warner, social worker from DCFS and cha1.rperson of the team. Puig added that DCFS had awarded the gra~t, allowing DCFS and, the S,tate' s Attorney's Office to allocate one worker each for the purpose of expanding the concept to other hospitals in Lake County. - Puig told us that his role was to establish \"hard evidence\" of child abuse for presentation in court. He told us that after 18 m<;>nths of operation, 38 cases had been staffed \"by CPT from his ~o~p~tal alo~e= ~ll were staffed within 72 hours following the l.n1.~1.al phys1.c1.an s report. Puig mentioned that the one problem fac1.~g the te~m was eventual \"burnout,\" When cases begin to become rout1.ne and s1.mply alphabetical. He said that the problem could be prevented by shifting staff assigned, but then the team would lose t~e, close working relationships established, a's well as the exper\u00ad t1se that had been demonstrated by the team already working. Puig had no solution to this problem. Pu~g told. us that five to seven cases had gone to court. One of the Judges 1.n Lak~ County had commended the team for keeping \"nonsense\" cases out of court. Puig also mentioned that marlY doc\u00ad to:s are afraid of lawyers; therefore, they do not always report ch1.ld abuse cases when they should. He said the fear comes from t~e present':ltion of their testimony in court. The doctor is always r7ght when 1.t comes to medicine, Puig said, but on cross-examina\u00ad t70n the ~oc~or's diagnosis. can be easily disputed. Puig felt that h1.s own w1.111.ngness,to test1.fy in court on specific cases and as an expert witness, had been a good example to some of the' doctors in the area. Puig\u00b7 said that the purpose of the team was therapeutic, not to generate criminal cases a'r statistics. The team had not handled ~any cases of homicide and apparently would not. He said that the team was designed to concentrate on separat.ing marginal cases from severe cas,~s, to screen sexual abuse, and to,..;:;dssure that perpetra-tors of severe injuries are prosecuted. . Based on his team experience, Puig offered several suggestions for improvement of child protection. He'; felt that some arrangement should be made for parenting to be taught. He said this is parti\u00ad cularly important in incest cases; in these cases, often the parents a:e\" offered counsel~ng. and noth~ng more. He said that counseling W1.l1 not affect the1.r 1.nappropr1.ate behavior.. At the time of our interivew in 1980, Puig was in favor of a central registry for collection of important data. ~uig felt that.each c0';lnty could be divided into units geo\u00ad graph1.cally ,\u00b7each W1.th a ch1.1d ,abuse team with the authority to i~v7stig':lte child abuse. Lake County, he felt, could easily be d1.v1.ded ~,nto four such areas~ :He felt that cooperation was the key to $uccess with these teams and that representatives of both private and public agencies had to pool their expertise in order for them to achieve their goals. 'He added that \"personal problems\" should n.ot defeat the intended purpose of the team -393-FA ,,4 ;q // 'i Puig felt that judges had to be made aware that those who have repeatedly abused their children, particularly following court in\u00ad tervention, ar,e \"diseased\" and will be unable to parent their chil\u00ad dren. They will be able to help themselves only temporarily. Their relapses cannot be prevented, Puig added, indicating that children in such a family should be placed out of the home. He said that therapeutic failures should result in placement because the parents just do not understand how to be parents. Puig recommended that there be legislative guidelineS-for judges to make determinations on whether children should be removed from the home or allowed to remain. Similarly, there should be guidelines concerning sending children back into the home after they have been removed. Puig was in the forefront of the M-D team concept in Illinois; his comments and experiences should be important to considerations for implementation of similar teams in the future. Also in 1980, we interviewed Lake County Juvenile Court Judge Bernard E. Drew, Jr. At the time of the interview, he had been as\u00ad signed to Lake County Juvenile Court for approximately two years. He had been aware of the work of the Lake County Child Protection Team since its inception. Drew told us that the CPT was a sophis\u00ad ticated and professional approach to child abuse prevention that had his wholehearted support. He was particularly happy that team members study a case from all angles before it is brought to court. Drew was in favor of more hospitals implementing teams similar to the Lake County model. Commenting on ~ hospital in Highland Park that had actually said that it had seen no cases of child abuse, they are only \"burying their heads in sand,\" he said. In late May, 1982, we spoke with Gail Tuler Friedman, a Lake County Assistant State's Attorney, regarding multidisciplinary ,: teams now in effect in that county. She told us that she has b\\~en responsible for establishing these hospital-based teams for the!' past two years or so; she had been hIred through the DCFS gran~ for that exact purpose. She mentioned that in Lake County, there is an agreement between the hospitals, her office, and DCFS tha:t all suspected child abuse and neglect cases coming from hospital pediatric units or emergency roorqs be handled by one of these M-D teams. \" \":1 \" \"'~' \" She told us that each ho{pital has a team consisting of a re\u00ad presentative of her office, a DCFSworker, and. var~o';ls hospital. per:\u00ad sonnel (these individuals could include a ped~atr~c~an, emergency room doc~or, pediatric nurse, emergency room nurse, hospi~al so\u00adcial worker, etc., depending on the case). Apparently th~sagree\u00ad ment extended only to those cases referred from hospitals. Accord\u00ad ing to Friedman, in other cases of child abuse, DCFS f,eels it is in conformance with the law by having a multidisciplinary team com\u00ad posed of a DCFS nurse from the community\" a DCFS investigator, and other workers staffing ca,ses. other. wdrds, DCFS'. W-D ;',r .1. ~'. ,~~ ,; ...,. I i Friedman referred us again to the Colorado and Michigan stat\u00adutes, both of which mention multidisciplinary teams by name. Commission staff examined the statutes. For purposes of compari\u00adson, Colorado's statute consist\u00ad ing,where possible, of a physician, a representative of the juvenile cour~ or the district court with juvenile jurisdiction, a.representat~ve of a local law enforcement agency, a representa\u00ad t~ve of the county department, a representative of a mental health clinic, a representative of a public health department, an attorney, a representative of a public school district, and one or more representatives of the lay community. Each public agency may have more than one participating member on' the team; exce~t that, in voting on procedural or policy matters, each publ~c agency shall have only one veto. In no ~vent shall an attorney member of the child protection team be appointed as guardian for the child or as counsel' for the parents at any subsequent court proceedings, nor shall the child protection team be composed of fewer than three persons. When any racial ethnic, or linguistic minority group constitutes a signifi- cant portion of the population of the jurisdiction of the child protection team, a member of each such minority group shall serve as an additional lay member of the child protection team. At least one of the preceding members of the team shall be chosen on the basis of representing low-income families. The role of the child protection team shall be advisory only. (Colo. Rev.

Information from Workshops, ~' Commission staff concentrated on M-D teams when they~attended ~he 5th National Conference on Child Abuse and Neglect in ~pril, 1981. Staff attended three workshops and picked up descri:>tive liter~ture on a program operative in Moline, Illinois~ \\ First we will summarize the workshop \"Multi-DisciPlina~\u00a5 Teams: Are They Really Helpfu11\" The session's moderator was Franc\\i.ne J. !I \\) I) / -395-Vecchiolla from the Department of Children and Youth Services in Connecticut. Members of the panel included: Larry Breitenstein, Director, CPS, sou~k Carolina Department of Social Services Jolie Ikard, Administrator, CPS, Arkansas Division of Social Services Linda Radigan, State Child Protection Coordinator, Social and Rehabilitation Services, Concord, New Hampshire William Chamberlain, Staff Associate, Child Abuse and Neglect Resource Center, Athens, Georgia The purpose of the panel discttssi9n was to examine experiences of representatives from several states that had all developed a~d im\u00ad plemented multidisciplinary teams. - All of the workshop participants mentioned that the multi\u00ad disciplinary teams with which they worked were new in conceP1::; each state had different ideas concerning how these teams would operate. Nonetheless, many of the problems ,facing the teams were common to all of the participant.$. The problems encountered most included' issues of confidentiality, the role of members representing dif\u00ad ferent jurisdictions, ~nd what member agency would be responsible for the implementation of recommendations or sug<]estions developed at team meetings. In addition, the participants 'were concerneq with the fiscal feasibility of maintaining such teams. i Breitenstein, from South Carolina, had worked with both hos\u00ad pital-based teams and treatment advisory teams. He said that his state legislature had mandated the creation of 46 treatment advis-:; ory teams, one for ea,ch county, to provide ass.essment and treat- .' I ment services for cases of abuse and neglect. In addition, the state had one sexual abuse team, three hospital-based teams, and eighteen \"community councils Ii designed to offer public education concerning abuse and neglect. Breitenstein commented that the early proble~, in 1978, was in interesting doctors and teachers in the work the teams were to do. Many of the early teams had little knowledge even about what child abuse was. Breitenstein commented that while the idea behind the teams was good, o~ly those teams that had existed prior to the legislation mandating each county to have one were really success\u00ad fuL Breitenstein said that before a team is created, a careful needs assessm-ent must be done. Because the needs of each community c) vary I as do their resources\" the teams wi\"l.l vary in composition and focus. . In .orga!li'zing teams,;educatitig team memPers was seen as very important.' '. Cla:s~res were held itijiidentification of abus.e, the reporting 'laws ,the role of CPS wor~ers I the concept behind treatment and assessment, and other isst~es.. Prev~ntion was c, also a big issue when the teams were' first developed; i . he learned that many professionals were completely unaware that prevention services were available to team members. ~he panel,discussed the issue of confidentiality. In South Caro11na, t~e 1nformation developed by a team cannot be shared with a~yone outs1de of the team. Breitenstein told the workshop parti\u00ad c7pa~ts that this p:ovision in the law only made team work more d1ff1cult, because 1f a teacher wanted information, for instance, about a stud~nt ~ho ~ay have been an abuse victim, the advising team could not g1ve 1t to her unless she decided to become a team member. The South Carolina incest team had done little to affect the problem. Howe~er, the nature of the problem didn't prevent the tea~ from ~ork1ng. The team members simply were not dedicated. Bre1tenste1n said that no single member of the team wanted to be held responsible for a child's well-being in incest cases. Linda Radigan, of New Hampshire, mentioned that there are ten M-D teams oper~tive in her state, eight of which are community\u00ad based an~\",.pro~1d7 cO~~iultat~on services. Radigan indicated that th7 con~'r~';'lt7al1ty 1ssue had caused too great a problem but st111 ~o't:..~<!\u00a3 11ke to see a legal standard set for the state. Radi\u00ad gan ~a~d t~at numerous questions had been raised regarding this sens1~1ve 1ssue, such as: should a client or her attorney have the r1ght to know about such meetings? Should information dis\u00ad c;:ussed be made \u00b7a part of the client's file? Should confidential- 1ty rules for the team hold precedence over those for the indi-vidual agencies? . Radigan said that some of the teams had: experimented with discussing cases without using the case name; apparently this tac\u00adtic had been quite successful with some teams. However, among other teams, t'he practice had proven to be counter-productive. be\u00ad cauSe it fostered ~is~rust among team members. An additional prob- 17m was that, 'a~ t1me~, team members had open cases on people being d1scussed and d1d no\u00b7t \\I:knowduring the meetings that the discussion was about their clients. . ' ( , Members of the audience with experience in the use of M-D teams were asked to comment on what the 'teams had done in their states and what 'the majo; issues ,'Were. In MinnesQta,the state' had developed a number of guidelines for the use of M-D teams: 1) All team members sign an agreement that they will abide by some standard which the state agency sets, and that the \" overall purpose of the tean't is to protect the client'~ \"2)' Clients should always be informed at a meeting and be al\u00ad lowed to attend. . , .3) A written itinerary should be sent to each team member before a. meetirlg ,so that work can begin promptly. -~ -~ -~----~-----~~-------~--------.--.-----~~~ ---.--~.--------- 4) Non-team members invited to attend must agree to follow the rules of confidentiality that apply to team members. 5) Any written summary should be entered into the client's file. A representative from Madison, Wisconsin, mentioned that issues included whether the team should actually provide case management and, if so, who should provide it. This person was primarily con\u00ad cerned with interagency cooperation and communication. The primary issue in Arkansas was confidentiality; the same was true in Vancouver; Washington. In Washington, a representative raised the issue ~f how one assures confidentiality. In North Dakota, the primary issue was finding a way to pro\u00ad vide resources in the rural community. A Commission staff member also attended a workshop titled, \"Multi-Disciplinary Teams: What Have We Learned?\" The presenters included CPS administrators, administrators of state social ser\u00ad vice programs, and a staff member from the Region IV Child Abuse and Neglect Resource Center. Three were from poor southern states, and two were from the New England area. Presented first was the mult:Ldisc.:j.plinary team approacll used, in Arkansas. We were told that Arkansas is 49th among the states in per capita income and has the highest teenage su.:j.cide rate. In Arkansas, the increase in reports of child abuse and neglect H1- creased from 1975 to 1981 by 1400%. During the same period, there was only a 15%. increase in social service personnel. There has also been a 25% decrease in funding. ',I Arkansas has five M-Dteams throughout the state, thJ;ee of which are hospital-based.. The other two are community-based. None of these five teams was formed at the request or mandate of, arw state agency. All wE;!re private initiatives. Membership in two of the teams is not even formally defined. 'Only one of the five has a formal review process; still another completely rejects ,the for\u00ad mal review approach. Two of the five groups have specific criteria concerning what to place on their agenda. At the same time, though, all of the teams respond to crisis situations. None of the groups meets only by appointment or schedule. The presenter said that most team members \"are not formally trained or educated\" in multidisci\u00ad plinary team work, though each represented a specialty on the team. In spite of the many differences among the teams, all five were viewed as being quite successful. It was pointed out that Arkansas M-D teams probably don't\u00b7 offer better case management than do individual caseworkers, but there are pluses.inthat wor~ers learn skills, gain added strengths, and provide better liaison to the community. Another pre$enter, from Region IV,'\u00b7 stated that the primary purpose of teams is to fulfill co~unity needs, not to provide case -398-. ! \\. consultation. He said that teams should function for the follow- \" ing purposes, and in this particular order: as community-based teams; for case consultation as social service teams; as treatment\u00ad providing teams; and as mixed models (teams that provide portions ~f other services just mentioned). He added that urban teams must d1f\u00ad fer from rural teams, . though he did not elaborate. He also said that M-D teams in the future will have to address two very important areas: prevention, and effective use of com\u00ad munity resources. All of the presenters agreed that there are three major p:ob\u00ad lems facing multidisciplinary teams right now. These are conf1- dentiality; legal liability of individual team members; and th7 cost to government to organize and maintain teams. The representat1ve from Region IV stressed that it is imperative that we educate our legislators concerning what a team is and how it operates so that confidentiality does not continue to pose a problem. Several presenters agreed that teams should begi~ at the com\u00ad munity level with volunteer professionals. They ment10ned that these teams are experimental by their very nature and should be allowed to go through natural change. The presenter~ admitted that the problem with teams that are not mandated by law 1S that the team members are at greater risk of becoming legally liable. A panel member from one of the southern states mentioned that just such a problem had arisen in his state. still, they gen7ral~y agreed that as social services dwindle, low-level commun1ty 1n\u00ad volvement is the way to\" move-:particularly with volunteers. ,1 They mentioned that there is usually an initial fear among social workers when teams begin. They are afraid to utilize them. Teams can point out mistakes that workers have made, ~hey may at least initially increase the amount of paperwork requ1red, and. they can present \"tUl:(.:f\" problems, from the social worker's perspect1ve. One of the panel members mentioned that if a \"systems approach\" is not developed, any team will take a full year to just ~et started. When we asked what a \"systems approach\" is, we were told 1 t refers simply to good,~hor6ugh planning. Volurite~rs in particular must be trained and oriented pefore the team beg1ns to work, not after. One of the panel members said that volunteer hours and any donated or in-kind costs should be totalled and the amount given to legislators, who might feel that. teams are too expensive ,to implement. She said that in conn7cticut, eac~' team of vo~unteers saves the state $13,000 per year 1n donated t1me and serV1ces. One of the \"other panel members added that it makes. no ~ense to cre\u00ad ate teams that do not utilize volunteers because 1t w1ll save no money. South Carolina pays a portion. of the costs ofM-D tea~s,_, but one person noted that Louisiana spends $500,POO per y~ar.Jus~ paying p.rofess'ionals to serve on teams, an expense very ~1ff~cult to justify to state legislators. The only way to determ1ne 1f.the use of teams is really cost effective, the presellters agreed, 1S to -399-F Qe; g \u00a5lIf look at the costs of not using the court so much, not using jails, and perhaps determining costs saved by not utilizing other services. o~e of the J?anel me~e:s that legislatures provide ~mmun~ty the work that professionals do on M-D tea~s. , One panel member noted that in Alabama the problem is avo~~e~because\"all cases that are staffed are treaied as \"hypo\u00adthet7cal <?ases, as, though no one knows the case is real or knows the ~dez;:~ty of the J?eop17 iz;volved. He added that this process also sk~r~s the conf~dent~al~ty problem~ then he added that the' problem w~th using cases in this way is that it may also be ~llegal. All of the panel members agreed that the teams that fare poorly are usu~lly set up by \"outsiders\" from the state department of child protect~on or welfare. One panel member mentioned that state-spon\u00ad sore~ teams \"did more damage than they helped.\" The state social ~erv~c7 workers have tr~ed to turrttheproblem around by stressing, ~n the~r ~eam consultat~on, education, prevention, and pure case consultat~on. They have backed away from interference in \"local matters.\" ~he 7epresentative from South Carolina mentioned that informa\u00ad tion ~~ h~s state may be shared only with other team members, not even w~th teachers or policemen who may have reported a case. The panel members agreed that, when possible, those involved with a case, particularly the client, should be notified when the team is,going to discuss their case. Not only might they have a legal right to be present, but the panei members felt that the prog\u00ad nosis for work with that person would be better.' The presenters agreed that the law is needed to \"legitimize'\" teams. The panel member from New Hampshire suggested that all 'team members agree to be bound by the same legal restrictions as CPS . wor~er~. This would alleviate the liability and confidentiality anXl.et~es. All non-team members invited to a, meeting would have to agree to the same restrictions. . , .. A Commission investigator also attended a session the' Con\u00ad fer7n~e titled Consultant, Minnesota Department of Pub\u00adlic Welf~re, St. Pal.ll, Minnesota. The focus of the workshop was oZ; the M~nn7sota exper~ez;ce in developing and implementing state\u00ad and tra~n~ng for child development, counseling, edu\u00ad c~t~on, and law enforcement professionals. .The workshop was id~nti\u00ad f~ed as one of those that treats multidisciplinary ideas. , Kiley mentioned early in his presentation that one of the first th~ngs he learned from his work in Minnesota was that one cannot assume that mandated reporters even know they are mandated reporters. The\u00a5 have to be told, and then told what sorts of training ;might; be ava~lable ~or thel!1 ~o better and x'eport child abuse. +n determ~n~ng who should provide training oversight for -400-I. :1 ''-~, .. r 1 ., t t ~ I , reporters, Kiley menti6n~d~that each state should determine who can perform the task as we~l as do it cost-effectively. He added that the Minnesota experiehce had shown him that it is best to \"rely on the disciplines to\"'train themselves (cops train cops; teachers train teachers; etc.).\" Then it is the responsibility of the overseeing agency to train the trainers. Kiley mentiol1,ed im\u00ad portant qualities to look for in selecting trainers. They include: credibility within their discipline; experience with their disci\u00ad pline~ and honesty about their feelings. Kiley said that the trainer of mandated reporters has to deal with peoples'\" fears of what their 'report will mean to them. And they need to understand how the system is set up to monitor calls. They need to know what will happen after a report is made. Kiley recommended that CPS staff provide training regarding this part of the report. Kiley commented that \"the real goal in training is not sO'much an increase in the number of rePorts, but in the ac\u00ad curacy of the reports made.\" Kiley also made the point that proper training of reporters can foster a degree of cooperation among the different disciplines. He said that it is very important for people to understand how they fit into the realm of child protection and that the breaking down of \"territory\" by one profession will not weaken anyone's position within the overall system. Of greater value was material we picked up at the Conference that dealt with the Council on Children at. Risk (CCR), the Inter\u00ad Agency Coordinating Project in Moline, Illinois. The Council pre\u00ad sented its materials at one of the several forums presented at the Conference, in which Conference participants' could pick up descrip\u00ad tiv.e literature and, if they wished, speak with representatives of different programs. The CCR serves the entire Quad-City area by assisting agencies in coordination of service delivery to families that have been identified as abusive or at risk. The project brings together all agencies, both public and private, involved in cases referred to it. The project consists of several different teams, ~ach of which is diverse and composed of .s~veral different team members. Team members might include, for instance, a representative from the law enforcement sector, a school representative, someone from a local hospital, someone from a private social service agency, the r~fer\u00ad ring agency caseworker, (such as a DCFS case~orker), and representa\u00ad tives from other public social service agencies. The CCR would then coordinate the activities of all the team members on any given case. In order for a case to be referred to CCR, the following cri\u00ad teria must be met: 1) The case must be open either with DCFS or the Iowa Depart\u00ad ment of Social Services. ,-:\" 2) Severe or chronic abuse must be present, or -401-~----------~.--------------------------~-------------------~------------------ \\) \u00b7~~. ------------ 3) The case must ,pe a high risk/potential abuse or neglect case. 4) Multiple problems must exist within the case--e.g., mari\u00ad tal, financial, mental or physical health problems in com\u00ad bination. 5) The activities of at least three agencies should be co\u00ad ordinated. Ii 'i II The family involved must agree to cooperate and sign a release of information to allow team members access to all information, in\u00ad cluding the state's Attorney if there is to be court involvement. Interestingly, since involvement by the family is voluntary, they . can inchtde or exclude whichever team .,members they want. It is . t:qe responsibility of the referring agency to keep' team members abreast of court dates and the outcomes of hearings. . Finally, we will present a few excerpts from the literature disseminated by the CCR, including a portion of the group's pro\u00ad ject descriptic.m: The Council on Children at Risk Inter-Agency Coordinating Project assists Quad City community agencies in coordinating and planning services for individ'i~l families in which child abuse or neglect has been an identffied problem or risk. The project's purpose is to provide a vehicle through which avail\u00ad able community 'services can be used efficiently and effectively, casework goals ca,n be achieved through the concerted efforts .of all involved service providers and the client family, and needed services can more \"readily be identified and developad. Objectives A. Ventilate cas~ related concerns and frustrations. B. Share decision-making responsibilities. C. Resolve conflicts. D. Provide positive feedback and affirmation to workers and families. Inter-Agency Case Coordinating Process Guideliries Regarding Confidentiality 1. Because absolute confidentiality cannot be ~uaranteed, client families should be informed of this reality by the refe~ring case,\",orker. 2. The release of information -'form mus't be approved and signed by the client family before case coordinating services can '~ be implemented. 3. 'The family should be informed that a written staffing re\u00ad port will be disseminated to the team members. \" ' ; -402-J i 4. 5. 6. Only representatives of the agencies/organizations listed on the release will be permitted to participate in the staffing process. The family must approve the addition .. of new team members by having their names added to the release form. Summary staffing reports will be stamped confidential and sent only to authorized team members. In order to release information shared at staffings or copies of the staffing reports to persons who are not listed on the release, team members should refer to their own organization's policies con,cerning confidentiality and the release of information. (If no such policy exists, please check with the appropriate person in your organi\u00ad zation for guidance.) So pressing i~ the confidentiality issue that the CCR spends a great deal more space in their descriptive information dealing with it than with the entire process of team development, refer\u00ad ral, termination of services, and evaluation. It must be a con\u00ad sideration in the development of any multidisciplinary team. 3. Research One of the earliest documents that we reviewed during our investigation is the 1978 \"Multidisciplinary T~~ams in Child Abuse and Neglect Programs,\" a special report from the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect. Th~ general introduction pOints out that M-D teams are needed because child abuse is a problem with multiple consequences among overlapping professions. The report also describes the types of teams in use at the time it was written. Hospital-based programs usually provide evaluation, consultation, and crisis intervention . rather than con\u00ad tinuing direct service. The report singies out one program in Baltimore that has provided such direct treatment; it is considered successful because it is composed of staff members who are will\u00ad ing to become intensely involved with their clients. Interagency programs axe another category of M-D team. These 90mmunity-basedteams e.nhance communication and cooperation be\u00ad tW,een the many agencies involved in child abuse. They also may provide a network\" whereby Hhospital-shopping\" abusive parents (those who abuse th~ir children and take them to different hos\u00ad pitals following each injury to escape det-ection by authorities) can be identified. These teams may try to educate the community regarding the reporting of'abuse. Further, \"Some teams combine the function of interagency cpoperation with that of direct re- n 0 sponsibility for case management and service delivery.\" A~other type is/the \"state-mandated multidiscipl'inary team\" provided for by law. The report specifically mentions teams that h~ve been established in Colorado, Michigan, Misso~ri, California, -403-\" \\ . '. i .. \\' .... ~.,. , Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Each of these states has a program that differs slightly from ,the others. The language of the en\u00ad abling statutes ranges from very specific to extremely vague, as in California's authorization of pilot. M-D teams in three counties. The authors also have included in the report a directory of thO.se programs throughout the country that util,ize a multidisciplinary approach. Included are two II+inois gr.oups,both located in Chicago: the Child Advocate Association, and the American Red Cross' Parent Aides--Vblunteers in Support of Visiting Nurses Asso\u00ad ciation--Neglected Children. Singled out as a team approach that appears to be exempl?ry is Virginia's. A portion of that state's guidelines follows: In order for a multidisciplinary child abuse and neglect team to 'meet the~u II spectrum of a community's needs, the team should consist of two 'general components or committees: a case Consultation Committee and a Program Development Commit\u00ad tee. The guidelines indicate that a community-based team should: 1) have a written statement clear~y identifying its purpose; 2) obtain sanction and ~upport from influential community groups; 3) have a written statement of operating procedur~s; 4) 5) 6) 7) be permanent; use state laws to write operational definitions of abuse and neglect; base their size on their purpose, and ref,lect the spec\u00ad trum of preventive and treatmentresourgesavailable to abused children in their membership; (;. involve a representative from the military if a military installation exists within,the community; and 8) develop ways to involve citizen ~articipation. Finally, the guidelines also address the prOper area for a team to cover, mpre about citiz.en,participation, parent and child rights, inter-agency agreements that might be necessary, and methods of program evaluation and. research. .' Th~ report focuses also on the Pennsylvania model, noting\" that this stat~ I s, guidelines reconutlend written statemepts of gO?lls and operations,. procedures .and that such(\u00a3) group be permanent and supported by community groups whenever possible.Pennsyl.vania'S guidelines for team ,composition follow in.par;,t; -404-~.'::-:, \\ r ~ ,- ,~-' ~ .~ \\\\ '\\ I 'i \" \" r .. \\ Ii Representatives from the fields of social service, health, men\u00ad tal health,. education, law enforcement, legal profession, and elected 'governmental officials should be included.

The report includes an Illinois directory and a brief discussion of five spe\u00adcific teams. Busch's report presents his ,own interpretation of the section of statute that mandates' the use of M-:Dteams in Illinois, as well as DCFS' interpretation of what tha~. statute means. The salient excerpts from his arguments fOllow: To the fullest extent feasible, the Department shall cooperate with and seek the cooperation and involvement of all appropriate public and private ,agencies, including health, ,~ducation, social service and law enforcement agencies, courts of competent juris\u00ad diction, and agenc:les, or9anization~, or programs providing or concerned with human. servi~es related ~,to the prevention., identification, or treatment of childiibuse and neglect. Such cooperation and involvement shall include joint consul\u00ad tation and /j;ervices, joint plannL'lg, joint case manage'ment, joint public education ana information services., joint utili\u00ad zation of facilities, joint 'staff qevelop7ll.ent and other train\u00ad ing, arid thE;! creat~on' of multidisciplinary case diagnostiC, .' case handling, case management, and policy planning teams. o New requi~ements imposed 9Y $.ection 7.1 do not obligate the Oepa~tment to usemultidiscipl~nary teams, but do require that an effo~be maae'to make them a part of child protective ser\u00ad vice.s. A strict interpretation would suggest that only when multidisciplinary teams are demonstrably not \"feasible\" should their use not be pursued. -405-, PA 44 .F the most obvious role for multidisciplinary teams is to pro~': vide advice or consultation on the different decisions CPS Units must make. The Act does not prescribe an organizational locus for multi\u00ad disciplinary teams of any type. But, teams based outside the Department seem most likely, and are clearly consistent with the intent of section 7.1. Busch states that three of the state's eight DCFS regions are without a single team\u00b7 also, less than 2% of child protection cases in the rest of the. ~tate have any type of team involvement. Busch also lists the three types of M-Doteams, based on the three major phases., of CJ)S functions. As we shall see momentarily, ~he greatest number of teams provide diagnostic and serv.ice plann~ng. Case coordination or treatment has a single program in the Aurora Region and another in the Peoria Region. Under ~he heading \"com\u00ad munity policy planning,\" there i~ only one team ~n the w~ole state, in the Aurora Region. Regions with ,\"diagnostic and serv~ce plan\u00ad ning\" teams are broken down as follows: Aurora 7 Cook County 20 Marion 3 Peoria 3 Springfi,eld o.~ 1 Busch comments that all Illinois teams vary according to team type, functional duties, and the \"availability of participants.\" He notes that almost all Illinois teams utilize permanent, volun\u00ad tary members: \"Exceptions are found in Springfield's t:amwith rotating members, Rock Island's diagnostic team with pa~dconsult\u00ad ants, and the two case coordination teams in the, State.\" Regarding the relationship that the.se teams have to DCFS, Busch offers the following: multidisci.plinary teams shall have an advisory, relation to CPS units. An exception to this rule. may arise if treatment services of some types arranged for but. m)t provid<ed by the Department are perf6rmed by a multidi$ciplinary team. Advi\u00ad sory relations might take either a voluntary:) or contractual, form. In the former case, a \\\\!\u00b7ritten agreement should, and ~n the latter must, provide the basi.s fo'r the relationship the 'multidisciplinary team might relate either to a CPS unit or to a Regional Office. ~ Bu.sch also addresses the issue of confidenttality, though he pro\u00ad vides no solutions: Sin6eno general authorization for release of Departme~t CPS records to members of multidiscipliJ)ary teams appears~n the Reporting Act., one may certainly quest'ion how it is that teams are to obtain the information. they need to .assist CPS Un.its.

Also briefly summarized are \"Springfield's Family Stress Consultation Tea~, waukegan's Child Protection Team (also des\u00ad cribed herein), and two \"case consultation treatment teams,\" one intake Villa and the othE3r ,a function of the CCR in Moline. ~ Busch concludes his report with this' statement: It is l~kely that important le~sons can be learned from the study of the multidisciplinary teams th~t have \"gone out of business\" in the past few years in the Champaign, Marion, Peoria and Rockford .Regions The lack Ilof systematic eva.lu\u00ad ative studies of multidisciplinary teams makes selection of program poliCies mo:r;e difficult. It is impossible to point to an \"ideal\" team model, nor is it likely that any single approach would work throughout the State. This sug<]ests that an exploratory approach should be taken, perhaps thrqugh demon\u00ad stration projects with evaluation components, and/or evalua\u00ad tions of exis,ting teams It is likely, in the author's view, that any study of multidisciplinary teams will conclude that they are infeasible unless team .services are targeted on particula~kinds of cases most in need of such intensive,in\u00ad tervention. The present willy-nilly use of most multidisci\u00ad plinary teams in Illinois is not only a questionable use of resources, but appears in some instances to. detract from ef\u00ad fective service delivery The Department now funds teams tnrough Child Abuse Grants and purchase-of-service agreements, and provides technical assistance formally (e.g., in the Marion region) and informally (through individual field staff initiative of various .,kinds). Additional or alternative meth\u00ad ods for each should be explored if the team approach is to be expanded. Clearly, ,Bus'ch' s role was to provide justification for the Department's use of multidisciplinary teams as they hc,tve progress~d in IllinoiS. Unfortunately, he is correct when he po~pts out the~r \"willy-nilly\" nature. The Commission will address the issue of, these multidisciplinary teams specifically in our conclusions and reconunendations. Another source describing an\"M-D team in Illinois i~, Theodo;re R.

He also \"prepares an agenda and min-' utes, acts as liaison to DCFS and other agencies, and chairs each meetin<J. The other professionals present specific information and make recommendations from their respective fields. The primary process is described as follows: The most critical component of team .functioning is the multi\u00ad disciplina}:y consultation conf.erence, held weekly and on call at the request of DCFS case'workers who are dealing with .abuse or neglect situations requiring additional professional input The informal atmosphere at the sessions perm'its free ex\u00ad change of opinions This free interchange helps develop mul\u00ad tidisciplinary recommend~tions. This particular team has enjoyed considerable success, according to LeBlang. In less than three years the team had re,solved more than 100' cases origingting in central Illinois and had received a positive evaluation from DCFS. II ~ontinuing our review of the research, we analyzed the federal Departtment of, Health and H~man Services User Manual on the subj ect, Jame!:1! L. JenkJ.ns' A CommunJ.ty Approach Ii The Child Protection Coor\u00ad dinating Committee. Jenkins and his c/b-authors state that, 'like I many social problems, child abuse is J problem of the total com\u00ad munity, thereby making the qprnrnunity !esponsible legally, mor~lly, and ethically to assume an active role in response to child abus~ll , I. , Ii This manual was designed to be used by community members (not just professionals); it describes some of the essential activi- ' ties involved in planning, organizing, and operating a \"community\u00ad wide child protection coordinating committee.\" Such committees are essential because ' A coordinated community is better able to initiate essential services that do not clo1rrently exist anci to minimize duplica\u00ad tion of services Th:e committee provides an organizational structure in which co~munity agencies, organizations, and con\u00ad cerned individuals can worJ< together to ove'rcome the problems of child maltreatment community. ,I and/or facilitating multidis\u00ad ciplinary chi\";.,\\d neglect case consultation teams The manual also meiit~Qns whoi' should sit on the committee, a list that -410-,: t ;, , I \\ we have presented before. The manual states that, in order to succeed three or four professionals will have to sit down and assess c~mmunity needs and resources. These three or four people, \"as a core group, must ,~e dedicated and,concerned individuals. Before establishing a larg~r group, thJ.s qpre group has to determine stra,tegy. The man\u00ad ual J.ncludes charts 'and narI:atiye information to help such a group get started. Specifically regarding the facilitation of multidisciplinary consultation teams, the manual states: \"The following steps are suggested as one approach to organizing ari.d facilitating the de\u00ad velopment of case consultation pu:tpose\"goals and objectives *appointmembers *select leader *define the roles and responsibilities of members *establish guidelines and procedures for case discussion *determine meeting schedules and identify procedures fClr calling emergency meetings The manual stresses that the coordinating cornl,\\nittee be ac\u00ad countable to the community at large and to its member organiza\u00ad -~ions and agencies. Finally, Commission investigators were given a good deal of material regarding multidisciplinary teams when they visited New York State. Most of the material we received was given to us by Mary Jane Cotter, Coordinator for the Mayor's Task Force on Child Abuse in New York City. We also received material that is state\u00ad oriented. When investigators spoke with Cotter, she' said that within the last two or three years there had been a grea\\t deal of interest in multidisciplinary teams in the New York c'ity area. Ultimately, from a series of meeting's, each of the five boroughs of New York City developed a team. Two major types of tea'ms were conSidered: diagnostic and treatment, and prevention. The pre\u00ad \"vention team is not really what it appears; this team would deal with cases in which abuse has been reported but has been deter\u00ad mined to be unfounded, but where there is still reason to believe th: family'may be qt'risk to abuse or neglectya child in the future. ThJ.s team would also examine cases referred by an agency in which there had been no report of\" abuse made. l ;-? The consultation cOIllItlittees conSidering establishing these teams,., determined that they could be set up at field offices of social service departments, or at other agency offices., The teams 0' could take a lead role or simply h::;ve an advisory role. The com\u00ad mittee~also determined that decisions concerning focus would have to be ~de: would the teamsfteal with all cases of abuse, or would there be a specialized team io handle cases of child sexual abuse, for instance? -411- __________ ~A~ __________________________ ~ __ __ One of the documents we received noted that the idea of inter\u00ad disciplinary teams had met with great, resistance from the Staten Is~and fiel~ Office. Caseworkers there fert that teams would in\u00ad ~rJ.nge on their responsibilities. These clear n?~ponsibilities of dif\u00ad ferent individuals in the :t~/m' process. Also included in t~i~ docu~entat~on is a position paper from the Human ~esources AdmJ.nJ.stratJ.on whJ.ch a.ffirmed its support teams: \"Looking at t~e '7ccomplJ.s~~ents of the past year, we find that the interdis- C ,?J.plJ.nary te~r.{ has proven to be a most effective means for deliver\u00ad J.ng quality child protective services. II The position paper also' comments on. two teams \"that were in existence prior to the coord i\u00ad pated effort to establish these teams in each borough: \"Although they fu~ction according to different models, each team reflects a co,?rdJ.nated appro~ch which utilizes the expertise of Socia'l ServJ.ces and communJ.ty agencies to diagnose and treat families reported for suspected child abuse or maltreatment.\" a. The Role of Educators , In our research on M-D teams, we reviewed several books 'and artJ.cle~ on the responsibilities of the different professions in\u00ad volved J.n such teams. One of the key issues we addressed is the role of the schools and educators in the prevention reporting tr~a~ment, and, follow-U1? of abuse and neqlect. In 19-17 Brian G. FraSier punlJ.shed a booklet \\'1i th the National Committee for Prevention. '. of Child ~use j\"n Chicago entitled \"The Educator and Child Abuse.\" Fraser pOJ.nts ou~ that many educators are fearful to admit or r(~>\":\" port cases of c~J.ld abuse. Such reluctance stems from ignorance of la~s protec~J.ng educators from liability for reporting a case that J.S determJ.ned to be unfounded. Furthermore Fraser's book-l:t pOints out that educat<?rs are required to re~ort child abuse, sJ.nce they are among the IJ.st of \"mandated reporters \" and that they can be I?enalized if they fail to report child abuse. Fras'er also presents the argument that often teachers and other educators are the \"last of line ,. defense\" aga inst child abuse: if they fail to detect and report child abuse, maybe no one will. , Another document we reviewed is another manual in the User S:rJ.es previously mentioned. This one, by Diane Broadhurst, i~ tJ.~led The Educator's Role in the Prevention and Treatment of. ''P ChJ.ld Abuse and Neglect. The manual points out that schools are the only p~ace that children are seen daily over periods of time by professJ.onals, who are in a position to note and evaluate their physical appearance and behavior. The manual also n6tes that (, abuse and neglect are tied closely to learning, citing r~search that ha? demonstrated that abused and neglected children often perform 'below grade-level in key academic areas. -412';\" I I t1 I The manual strongly recommends the school's notifying the parents if abuse or neglect is suspected in children. It mentions that communication can solve some of the problems that may have led to the abuse or neglect to begin with. But the manual warns that an educator should never contact a parent with the object of trying to \"prove\" abuse or neglect through accusations or de\u00ad mands for explanations. The manual states that, increasingly, schools should notify parents about reports being made to the author\u00ad ities. Such notification typically states the legal authority for the report and casts no blame on a parent. Parents are told to expect a visit from a CPS worker anq are told that they can expect the concern and appropriate support of the school. The manual says that schools that have instituted this procedure re- port good results in \\>lorking further with the parent9. The manual mentions many difficulties in the reporting of abuse by school personnel. It says that some teachers strongly feel that parents should be allowed to utilize any discipline they feel is essential. Some principals fail to file formal reports and try to deal with the .abusive parents themselves or ignore the abuse altogether. We will present the responses of several prin\u00ad cipals to general questions presented by our invest.igators early in this investigation. The responses, to be included in the second part of this report, show the range of feelings about re\u00ad porting among principals. This manual mentions t,hat principals who fail to report are not only obstructive bu't are breaking the' law. Superintendents of school districts who fail to provide in\u00ad service training relative to abuse and neglect identification and reporting are also, viewed as obstructive . The manual presents an array of services and attitudes that the school can provide once abusive or neglectful behavior has been identified. Educators should be alert to further abuse but remain non-judgmental. Schools can provide programs on parent education, early childhood, adult education, and counseling. So\u00ad cial workers in schools can make special efforts to work with the parents of\" abused children. Furthermore, the manual suggests that at times abused or neglected cqildren may need special school ser\u00ad vices, much the same as handicapped children need. The. manual suggests, when possible, that schools approach such programs with the active participation of the parent. Such special programs are most often effective if the parents a~e involved. Abused children can also benefit ~rom school-related functions already available, including free lunches, visits from the school nurse, and after-school day care. Broadhurst urges. that educators be included in M-D teams, which usually are composed of concerned community doctors, nurses, social workers, attorneys, and other professionals: The, team concept is an excell,ent one, and one with which edu\u00ad cat,or~ are thoroughly familiar. In fact, ,in many communities, the school individualized educational planning team can serve as a model for >the community-based case consultation teams. -'413---~------~--------------- Educators can make additional contributions to the team. They can lend their expertise in the areas of child development; IIspecial children, II e.g. ,hyperactive or retarded children; and the educational needs of children, etc. 18 The manual also mentions the kinds of curricula tha.t can be adopted by high schools and even junior high schools to prepare children for the eventual task of parenthood. Many schools dq not offer courses in parenting. The manual states that in some school districts, married students and adolescent parents are ex\u00ad cluded from the traditional academic programs and ex'tracuf'ricular activities. Broadhurst points outcthe likelihood that such ex\u00ad clusion can only heighten the loneliness and\" isolation already experienced by these adolescents. The manual also addresses the issue of ,corporal punishment in the schools. Broadhurst says: rne issue of corporal punishment in schools requires careful examination. There is a paradox in discouraging parental use of corporal punishment while permitting educator u,se of\" it. One may argue that it is a matter of degree. But educators too may ;become angry while punishing a child, and the result may not be discipline, but abuse. Strict, control of corporal punishment may be another way to prevent child abuse and ne\u00ad glect. Finally, the manual recommends that schools sponsor jointly with various community groups to deal with child and neglect, including training seminars for persons who children, and general public awareness campaigns s '';, programs abuse I work WJI;th On September 2'5, 1980, a Conuhission investigator attended ;'[' the Third Annual Gm.h~rnor I s Conference on Child Abuse, sponsored;\\! by the IllinOiS Chapt'lrr for Prevention of Child Abuse. One of the workshops he atter~ded was titled \"The Roles of ,-, Schools in Child Abuse\" and was nibdel:'ated by Richard, J. Martwick, Supel;\"in\u00ad tendent of the Cook co~nty Education Service Region. Several large issues concernin<j, the role of the schools in c1::lild abuse 'and neglect reporting, \\'treatment, etc., were discussed at this sess ion. II \" , 1,\\ , One of tha~ schools could ~n :f,act prevent ch~ld abuse. The participantd ll agreed, however, that bringing the sub\u00ad ject of abuse to the attention of students and teaching'respect for human life, coupled Ij!;ith education programs and other parent education through the P~iA/PTO, should be considered effective pre\u00ad ventive measu,res. \" /1 \" , II ' The partiCipants ,a~freed that the major role that schools play is in de~ection of abus1~ al~d neg~ect. All agreed ,that all con\\rersant w~th the appropriate li;l.wS regardiag -414-detection and reporting of child abuse, including their duty under the law. In-service programs should be provided by schools and districts. The partiCipants agreed that though there is no legal requirement beyond mere reporting, a team composed of the report\u00ad ing teacher, the school nurse, and the school psychologist or so\u00ad cialworker should be involved in child abuse and neglect situa\u00ad tions. Some workshop partiCipants expressed the opinion that the stronger reporting law, whiCh\" now requires teachers to report di\u00ad rectly, may actually have a negative effect on reporting. They were concerned over the identity of the teacher being known as the reporter of abuse. ' One school still had a policy, contrary' to law, thatl a teacher report abuse to the school nurse or psy\u00ad chologist so that the teacher is not drawn into further proceed\u00ad ings. I' , i/ In a di.sCl\\Ssion of identification, it became clear that schools were not doing their share in reporting and identifying abuse and neglect~ It was pOinted out that DCFS gets reports in about 50% of their cases on children of school age. However, only 5-6% of their reports,at the time were coming from schools, indicating that there is a wide gap in school identification/reporting and \"the actual incidence of abuse and neglect. The partiCipants in this wor,kshop were unable to agree on the prof ile of a \"typical\" abused 'cbild and said that the indicators of abuse and neglect are too broad. Teachers agreed that they needed to adopt a ques-' tioning Cittitude if they were to detect abuse at all. SOIne particip,ants point~d out that there is, a covert kind of relationfhip between school officials and parents, and that this relationship is destroyed when a parent is reported. The otherwise cdnfidential nature of the parent/school relationship is altered wrien a report is made. The teachers ag:t:\"eed that it is important to adopt an unemotional method of telling the par\u00ad ents that a report has been or is about to be made. Only if that process is handled prpfessionally can one expect the case to be, resolved successfully. Often parents become scared or hostile if notified in the wrong manner. Some teachers mentioned that it is essential that schoolS become aware of community resources; at some point in most' abuse cases, the school no longer will be the appropriate place to deal with abuse, and referrals should be made. In discussing the issue of legal responsibility of a school toward a child, most partiCipants and listeners alike at the work\u00ad ,shop 'agreed that it often didn't seem to do any good to make a . report. to DCFS if D'CFS ue-rounds the case and thus does not follow up on it. This was one r~ason that schools have to develop local resources--to deal with those times ,that they,. feel that abuse has occurred but DCFS disagrees, effect~vely 4enying any further in\u00ad volvement or treatment. One school official commented tha.t he puts through the call to DCFS but m:ntions that ~he school ~ill handle the situation itself. Then ~f DCFS gets ~nvolved, f~ne, but if it doesn't, something still will be done about the case. -415-The teachers discussed follow-up. They agreed that fOllow-up is necessary in all cases, particuLarly for the sake of the child. Some teachers said that they felt partially to blame for the abuse occurring. Most teachers agreed that DCFS should report back to them on cases so that they know what is happening to prevent re\u00ad currence of abuse or neglect. The teachers agreed that this pro\u00ad cedure was not generally fo110wed. One teacher pointed out that under the new reporting law there can be a requirement placed on DCFS to report back if requested. ',' In \"The Educator and Child Abus~,1t Brian G. Fraser points out that an immediate indicator of abuse or neglect is habitual absences from school. Educators also should be wary if the par\u00ad ents, once contacted, appear to be alcoholic or drug addicts or if they show signs of loss of control ove~ a child. Fraser re\u00ad cOImnends that educators take an overly-active role as opposed to a too-passive role. Commi,ssion staff also analyzed Michael Halperin's 1979 book Helpj,ng Maltreated Children: School and Community Involvement. Halperin's initial chapters discuss the fact that.schooIs have already involved themselves in many aspects of 'a child \"s health; there is ample precedent and reason for them to be further con\u00ad cerned that a child is not being abused or neglected while at home. He makes the interesting point that no school that endors,es and utilizes corporal puni~hment can effectively assess anything but the most severe child abuse in the home, because the tech\u00ad niques used by school staf'\u00b7f to enforce rules might be exactly the same as the parents'. Ideally, a school should develop a child study team that would deal with any child with an educational or social problem that\u00b7 might prevent a child from reaching his potential. These teams would operate as small multidisciplinary teams but without the. multiplicity of disciplines. They can address issues in the school, schedule conferences wii:h parents, and try to provide for follow\u00ad up in the home. Halperin,specifically addresses the role of the guidance coun\u00ad selor. This person should: act as the reporting offiCial, par\u00ad ticularly when the principal is absent; provide supportive indivi\u00ad dual and small group sessions for children experiencing problems at home;,' observe children through classroom viSits and also in their own homes; serve as leader of any child study team developed; and coordinate school and community resources. b. The Role of Hospitals and Physicians ., Another User Manual from the National Center on Child. Abuse and Neglect is eptitled Guiqelines for the Hospital and CliniC: Management of Child Abuse and Neglect, by Barton D. Schmitt and others. It presents a number of charts and forms that can be uS.ed as mode'ls for hospital personnel. It also provides ,step-by-step instructions concerning management of child abuse and neglect case~' by hospital personnel. ) The document sta'tes that it is cri- -416-I tical for a hospital to deSignate a single person to be the liai\u00ad son person\u00b7to moni.tor reports of child abuse and neglect so that they do not get lost in the hospital. Without such a person, any response to alleged cases of abuse or neglect will be handled ex\u00ad tremely inconsistently. Further, all hospitals should have written policy and guide\u00ad lines for the handling of child abuse and neglect cases. All hos\u00ad pital personnel should be familiar with the procedures. Cases of alleged abuse and neglect should be given the highest priority, according to this document. The document states that hospital personnel should always be aware of the possibility of abuse and neglect with child in-. juries but should not incriminate the parents in thought or actl.on. Parents should be notified when a case may be diagnosed as abuse or neglect and should be allowed to admit their own children.into the hospital if they agree, without~ intervention by the hospl.tal, the police, or the local social service agency. Only ~hen the parents refuse should these other agencies be brought l.n to ob\u00ad tain protective custody. The document does state that parents should only be told, of a likely diagnosis of abuse/neglect wh~n. that diagnosis is fairly certain. If personnel are not certal.n but are suspicious, the documen~ recommends that personnel tell parents that a child needs hospitalization for further observa\u00ad tion ahd tests. In speaking with, the parents, the manual says, \"One can state: 'Your explanation for the injury is insufficient. Even though it wasn't intentional, someone injured th~s .chil~ . I am obligated by (your State) law to report all SUSPl.Cl.OUS l.nJur\u00ad ies to children.'\" The manual states that all siblings should be brought to the hospital for a full examination within 12 hours of the initial case report on a child abused or neglected. A court order may be necessary to accomplish this, the manual states. The manual reiterates what we have learned is DCFS policy: that the ultimate goal is for the parents to assume responsibi\u00ad lity for their children and to provide for them ade~uatelY. Par\u00ad ents should be encouraged to visit frequently, and l.t should be stressed that parental inte~action with children may be a key to their further ability to retain custody of their childr~n~ Hos\u00adpital personnel should keep a running log of dates ~f Vl.Sl.ts, dura\u00ad tion of these visits, and\" what each parent does during such visits. The manual stat~s that, in court, a physician's statement that it is highly unlikely that an injury was acci~ental r:>u~s the burden of proof on the parents to show that they dl.d not l.nJure their child . , Successful court hearings are assured by a doctor retaining accurate and completE), mE)dical records, revi~wing them before the court hearing, and sharing his knowledge wl.th the pro\u00ad tective service agency's lawyer. ER records should be brought to court to be submitted into evidence,. and x-rays and photographs of injuries also should be brought to court. -417-.14 44 \" 1 \" I J!..J i ! ; I \" 4 4QSCE This manual provides some information about f~ilure-to-thrive i~fants. There,are many causes for failure-to-thrive, but physi\u00ad c~ans must rema~n aware that two of the most common are under\u00ad feeding (nutritional deprivation) and general neglect. These prob\u00ad lems are confirmed when a failure-to-thrive infant below normal age weight when brought to the hospital easily puts on weight. In many of these cases, though a mother may claim that a child is receiving adequate calories, children are placed on restric\u00ad tive and bizarre diets, for a variety of reasons. The manual pOints out that in 5-10% of all failure-to-thrive infants there are also broken bones, which are usually found only when x-rays are taken. These fractures usually are in some stage of healing and are rarely recent. If they were, they would be indicative of abuse and the child's weight problems would be seen as concom\u00ad itant to the abusive environment from which the child comes. We also reviewed a 1976 article by noted child abuse expert Eli H. Newberger, M.D., entitled ~A Physician's Perspect~ve on the Inter-Disciplinary Management of Child Abuse.\" Newberger was at that time Director of the Family Development Study and Chief of the Family Development Clinic at the Children's Hospital Medi\u00ad cal Center in Boston. He also was an instructor in Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. The focus of his article rests on \"limiting factors\" that Newberger has identified as retarding successful interdiscipli\u00ad nary response to victims of child abuse and neglect. These in\u00ad clude: lack of understanding by members of one professional dis\u00ad cipline of the ethics and procedures of others; lack of communication from one agency to another; confus ion as\" to which agency should assume responsibility at different times; \"professional chauvin\u00ad ism\"; too much work for everyone in the child protective field and the ensuing sense of helplessness by all, leading to abandon\u00ad ment of the interdisciplinary approach; \"institutional relation\u00ad ships\" t:.hat limit communication among professionals, such as staff at one hospital being hesitant to communicate fully with staff from another hospital; the' prevailing attitude that abusers should be treated in a punitive fashion (because many professionals, such as doctors, may turn away from a system perceived or designed to ' be punitive and not rehabilitative); lack of cO~Jfidel1ce and trust across disciplines; and cultural isolation of ~~ofessional per\u00ad sonnel (most professionals are white and of a \":fiarticular cult),lral tradition and probably know nothing about other cultures or tradi\u00adtions)' Newberger'also makes the interesting point that in the hos\u00adpital the doctor is accustomed to thinking of himself as the \"boss\" and may be reluctant to share his information or skills with others, particularly ether doctors at other hospitals. Newberger sees ' this as extremely unfortunate, but he feels that it can be cor\u00ad rected with proper education and retraininq. A reeent article by Jean Caldwell in the Boston Globe (re-)) printed in the Chicago Sun-Times, October 17, \"r91i2) deals with the physician's role in detecting child abuse. Ronald Reeves, -418~, a military pathologist who specializes in child abuse cases, pOint\u00ad ed out that many of the indications of abuse that a doctor will see will be quite subtle. As many as 40 percent of children beaten to death will show no eX,ternal signs of injury. Reeves pOinted out that the physician should listen carefully to the explanation of any injuries. If the explanation does not fit the injuries-\u00ad for example, if there are no splash marks on a child said to have aCCidentally fallen into a tub of scalding water--the,doctor should suspect abuse. \"Children don't lie about\"injuries,\" Reeves said. The phys iq ian, should listen carefully to the child's account of the injuries. Reeves said that it is difficult to ask doctors to be suspi\u00ad cious every time an injured child is treated. He insists, though, that the only way to detect the more subtle cases is to pay close attention to the more subtle clues.' A thorough exam with the child completely undressed should be performed when there is the slight\u00ad est possibility of physical or sexual abuse. Finally, a complete autopsy should be p\u00a7rformed whenever a child dies unattended by a doctor or under strange circumstances. c. The Role of Law Enforcement Commission staff also reviewed a 1976 document from the National Institute of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice, Arnold Schuchter's prescriEtive Package: Child r,eport is the f~rst on the subJect wr~tten from the perspective of criminal justice. It offers a model system that emphasizes medical treatment for the child and due process for both parents and children. All child abuse':, cases are handled as medical emergencies under this plan. Hospitals to which abused children are taken a:r\"e to be licensed by the state in accordance with' certain written standards that are both \"medical anq:rPfoce\u00ad dural.\" This hospital becomes the primary decision-makin'9-\",,--qt~J~na for diagnostic assessment of all suspected child abuse casesl\\. The plan states that a trauma team, or ,multidiscipli~a::y te~Il1,)does not become involved with a case unt~l after a pet~t~on has been filed stating that abuse did actually occur. The local city or county attorney would receive rel?or~s of suspected child abuse. , He would deter-mine whether the~nforma\u00ad tion in the medical report was suffiCient for a petition to be filed. Petitions would be filed whenever there is probable cause. If there is only suspicion of child abuse, a \"pre-petition inv~sti\u00ad gation\" must be completed within three days of the report's be;l-ng received by the prosecutor. No agency that could concei~ably play a role in treatment or disposition of the case is to be ~nvolved in such investigation. This would, in effect, move child protE:lc\u00ad tive services workers and their functions from the,' beginning of intervention in child abuse cases to the end of the disposition, of such cases, where their limited resources could be better ut~- lized. C>' ;;\"419-A QJ\u00a7 aT. ,. \\ .\\ \" \\ ~ In the place of central registers, the author recommends im\u00ad plementing a \"Child Abuse Information File,1I a tightly-restricted source of information located within the courts. Such a file would not be a part of any social welfare function. In terms of reporting, the author states that, \".7\\ major reason for professi.onal underreporting is lack of confidence in the child protective law enforcement and judicial system t'hat handles suspected abuse cases after a report is made Consequently, at this time, we advocate improvement of services provided by the child protection system as the more effective method of increas\u00ad ing reporting. II While on its face this plan sounds realistic, the author of the model plan also recommends eliminating any pen\u00ad alty for not reporting. This proposal would require the court to appoint an attorney for every child in court as a victim bf child abuse or neglect. This attorney would not also serve the normal functions of a guar- dian ad litem. Further, the guardian ad litem should never be . a local child protective services attorney, since the interests of the parent and the child may conflict. The thrust of this proposal is that medical institutions would become \"the fulcrum for system change\" rather than social service agencies or the courts. The authors argue that the sys\u00ad tem could be implemented with only minor changes in the systems now in place. In practical terms in Illinois, for instance, this system would relieve CPS workers from the burden of conducting investigations. Pre-petition investigations would be handled by the local prosecutor's office. Hospitals would take on increased responsibilities, particularly in screening of child abuse and neglect cases c This would allow CPS and other DCFS workers to concentrate their efforts on service and development of a reason\u00ad able service plan. Multidisciplinary teams have been mandated in several states. They ha~e been suggested as tool9 for the management of child abuse and neg]~ect cases and as oversight mechanisD,ls for social service agencies. While such teams have met with m(ixed reactions, gener\u00ad ally they appear to be useful, forward-thin~ng cooperative groups of people genu~nely interested in dealing with abuse and neglect. The many models vary considerably, but our investigation has deter\u00ad mined t.hat the most successful teams include volunteers, 'utilize as many professional,disciplines as\"possible, and are community\u00ad based. 'The smaller the geographic area serveo., the more success\u00ad ful the team is likely to be. Involvement of a state social worker is esserl'tial, but this person should not be paid simply to serve on such teams throughout part of the state. The person should be a volunteer who serves on the ,team as a small portion of his duties as a CPS worker. Late in 1981, we received a list of priorities from the Illinois Commission on Children. Fifth on,the list of sixteen priorities was \"children in need of protection.\" In the brief -420-j j discussion concerning this priority, the first item on the agenda of recommendations is: \"Multi\u00b7-disciplinary teams are needed .to evaluate child abuse cases and coordinate the numerous community agencies. II All of the evidence, not the least of which includes our case studies in this report, pOints toward the value of M-D teams. Our specific conclusions and reconliaendations reg-arding the establishment of such teams are included in the following chapter. () -421-! , $C 44' \u00a5F \" .\\ ,)<1 , \" Chapter 9\" PUBLIC HEARINGS During our investigation of child abuse, we often encountered refe,r,ences to multidisciplinary ,child protection teams (see Chapter 8). It became clear that such teams would help solve many problep!.s in Illinois' child protectl.ve network, just as they had in .. Colorado and Virginia. Although the teams' value was manif.est, some details of implementation and operation in Illinois warranted further exam\u00ad ination. For this reason, the Commission held public hearings on multidisciplinary teams February 15, 1983. As \"we explain in Chapter\"8, section 7.1 of the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act encourages the D~p,artment of Children and Family Services (DCFS) to create multidisciplinary teams, but DCFS has not fully implemented such teams. Thus, we proposed an a~endment which would require such teams, spec~fying their composi\u00ad tf~pn and duties. Witnesses at the hearings included spokespersons from State's Attorney's offices, hospital-based mu!.tidisciplinary teams, a ju\u00ad venile court, two contractual agencies, and DCFS. A. Testimony Co-Chairman Aa~on Jaffe opened the hearings by describing the concerns which led hiJn to sponsor House Resolu.tion 776 and the value of multidisciplin'ary teams in allaying those conc~rns. He then called upon the first witness, the Commission's Chief Investigator. 1. Thomas Hampson Hampson began by pointing out that DCFS does not alone bear respons'ibility for protecting.Illinois' children; the Department: must always cooperate with other agencies in detecting, counseling, and housing abused,children. Unfortunately,' Hampson said, we did not' see the necessary cooperation during our investigation. In fact~ we often heard complaints from other agencies about lack of DCFS cooperation. Hampson noted, however, that DCFS has made Sig\u00ad nificant improvements in the last three years, including the state\u00ad 'wide, toll-free child abuse hotline; the computerized central policies r.egarding immediate notification of State's At-\u00b7 torneys and the, Chicago Police Department., Still, further ,improve- ,ment is needed. ' '\" Hampson then explained our recommendation of a statewide net\u00ad work of multidisciplinary teams patterned after those in Colorado and Virginia (see Chapter 10, recommendation 1). He described the teams' 'member,s, saying they would be responsible for case oversight, management, and planning. Hampson emphasized that the teams \"must have decision-waking authority in the treatment plan and not func\u00ad tion in only an advisory capacity, II though he, acknowledged DCFS' ultimate respg!?sibility for all child abuse and neglect reports. ,~ i \\\\ -423- Preceding page blank \\ '::; ~ H i; f' ;.-/ \" H !I ,II d it U H n d !{ W If 'J !; , J I ! I ~ i I a SCi os +.- The multidisciplinary teams' main purposes would be \"to develop model policies and procedures to be followed by all agencies that come ,in contact with abused children; to disseminate those policies and procedures to their colleagues, and to encourage the cooperation of all agencies and professionals in their communities.\" After Hampson's prepared statement, the Commissioners asked him to clarify a few points. Regarding membership, Hampson said that each team's coordinator, the DCFS representative, would appoint 'members according to the community's needs. These members' sala\u00ad ries would be paj.d by the agencies they work for, not the state, and so the teams would cost the state only the DCFS caseworkers' salaries plus abc;>ut 20% of those expen\u00ad s7s. Hampson sal.d that the teams' cost would be more than justi\u00ad fl.ed by the saved hours and enhanced efficiency of multidisciplinary cooperation. Finally, Hampson said the teams would review unusual cases--cases that the original DCFS caseworker was .unsure how to handle. He said the teams might also randomly monitor cases for procedural correctness. 2. Teresa Maganzini 'rhe second 'witness was a .. Cook County Assistant State's AttOr\u00ad ney and supervisor of the office's Child Abuse and Neglect Unit. In her prepared statement, Maganzini first discussed the 4.igh vol\u00ad ume of child abuse and neglect cases in her office: \"In Cook County alone as many as 350 new children per month may require the protec\u00ad tion of the juvenile court due to the most serious forms of abuse and neglect.\" She said that multidisciplinary teams could not be involved in every case reported to DCFS, and recommended that the teams advise DCFS Iinot in those cases where the facts are clear II but when \"there is a real question as to what disposition would'be in the best interests of th'e child. II ,i From Maganzini's viewpoint as an assistant state's attorney the teani could partiCipate in child abuse proceegings at two stages. F~rst, in cases where emergency protective custody is not being con\u00ad sl.dered, the team could help decide whether court involvement is needed. Second, in cases where children have been removed from their homes, the team eould help decide whether the children could return home safely. Finally I' Maganzini cautioned that legal mandates must be re\u00ad membered when setting .up the teams. The law gives DCFS primary re\u00ad spons ibility for investigating and serving disfunctioning famiI\"ll)s, and the county state's attorney's office is mandated to prosecute the cases u Maganzini said that \"careful study should be given to developing a system wherein the team concept can be incorporated within the legal framework so as to be truly cooperative and not antagonistic or competitive. II \" Upon being questioned by Co-Cha:l.rman Jaffe, Magariz ini said she agreed that there has been antagonism between departments, and that multidisciplinary teams therefore are an excellent idea in theory. She also said she has seen such teams work to children's benefit .. -424-l i~ _ il I J Though she is not opposed to multidisciplinary teams, she is con\u00ad cerned that their meetings could become mere forums for airing pro\u00ad feSSional differences. Co-Chairman Hastert then asked, simply, if the teams would work. Maganzini answered that they had a chance of working well if their functions and responsibilities were more clearly specified. ' 3. Neil J. Hochstadt and Linda L. Groetzinger Hochstadt co-directs the Child Protection Team at\u00b7 La Rabida Children's Hospital and Research Center in Chicago, where he also serves as director of the Behavioral Science Department. Groetzinger coordinates the Child Protection Team at the University of Illinoisl Health Sciences Center in Chicago while serving its pediatric clinic as a medical social worker. \\ \"\"\" .' \"\" Dr. Hochstadt called child abuse \"a very complex and varied phenomenon.\" ,He said that the \"complexityof the problem demands a multidisciplinary approach to adequately diagnose, plan, treat and follow-up abuse victims and their families.\" He then briefly described La Rabida's multidisciplinary team, saying that it was based on the following premises: --the team provides DCFS with a comprehensive evaluation of 'the child and the family before deciSions are made. --\"The\" multidisciplinary team must be involved as soon after the' abuse is reported as possible.\" --Because child abuse and neglect are most often chronic prob\u00ad lems, long-term involvement and follow-up are required. --\"Childabuse victims and families often come from disorgan\u00ad ized fragmented homes, from disorganized fragmented communi\u00ad t,ies and very often are placed in a disorganized fragmented protective service and child welfare system. The multidiS\u00ad ciplinary team must coordinate and organize all aspects of the follow-up treatment plan.\" - I;' )/ Dr. Hochstadt 'then gave some cautions regarding multidiscipli\u00ad nary teams~ He said that the team's members need to have a common sense of mission gained through working together daily. He warned that he has seen \"agencies misuse the multidisciplinary evaluation process, albeit inadvertently, to cover for the lack of adequate services,\" and that the \"multidisciplinary team is only. as good as the available services. II . Too often, Hochstadt said, lithe abused child receives endless rounds of diagnostic work-ups but never re\u00ad ceives any of the services then made three recommendations: 1 ) \"Regional .centers should be established in m~aical\"centers [These centers] would serve as'central diagnostic facilities for child abuse and neglect victims.\" , -425-2) \" the regional multidisciplinary teams [should] be re\u00ad sponsible for the long-term follow-up of all the children evaluated by the team.\" 3) The teams should \"begin their evaluation as soon after the child abuse, is reported as possible.1I In closing, Dr. Hochstadt wished the Commission well in developing IIthis important piece of legislation.\" From question1.ng, the Commissioners learned that Hochstadt thought multidisciplinary teams were useful for unusual or very serious cases. ~s examples, he mentioned children who have sustained serious injur- 1es that may be permanent, such as head trauma\u00b7 children who have failed in foster care and, thus are at high X:isk for emotional prob\u00ad lems; and abused children with chronic illnesses or handicaps.\" 'J Linda Groetzinger described the University of Illinois team; which has four functions :\" --to review all cases reported by the Center to DCFS as sus\u00ad pected abuse or neglect cases, as well as all questionable c,ases which may require reporting; --to provide discussion, consultation, and case planning to\u00ad gether as a team, assisting all staff involved in such cases; --to gat~er statistical data and report on child abuse and neglect cases of the health sciences center; and --to offer education and ,consultation on childoabuse and neg\u00adlect to all areas of the center. i\\ GrQ~tzinger made three specific s,uggestions regarding 1 ) 2) functions,of the team and roles and responsibili- t1es of each member can be defined in a gener~l way ~ through legislation, each community and each t.eam must establish such definitions specifically to meet the needs and express the uniqueness of the individual community.1I All team members should IIbe representing and to some '~:~~ gree accountable to agencie~, professional associations or citizen\u00a7' groups. II , ' IIAII members should be trained in the field of chil~) abuse in an ongoing facshion, including an extensive know\u00ad ledge of the community's experience, agenCies, and sys\u00ad tems in this field. Such training must be part of ori\u00ad entation and of continuing participation in the team.\" 4. Dallas Ingemunson 'Ingemunson, Kendall County's concerns teams\". ,,' -426-:! The proposal, he said, presuPPoEfed a lack of cooperation. He said that although it was true that DCFS used to not even like to speak to State's Attorneys, it was no longer-true. DCFS has sought out Kendall County State's Attorneys to train DCFS field:personnel, and now DCFS is training some State's Attorneys, too. According to Ingemunson\", the problem is not lack of cooperation, but lack of facilities and resources. \" Ingemunson felt that creating multidisciplinary teams would incur additional General Revenue Fund costs, and doubted whether legislation can mandate cooperation. He also feared that distrust and jealousy between neighboring counties' State's Attorneys and other professionals might carryover into team meetings. In sum, Ingemunson said he would be \"very cautious\" in implementing such teams. When questioned, Ingemunson reiterated the need for more faci\u00adlities and resources, and discussed the need for flexibility in the teams' boundaries. In his part of the state, he explained, it would take many counties to total 200,000 people. 5. Lola Maddox Maddox is an associate judge from Madison County's Circuit Court who has been assigned to Juvenile Court. \"She had several questions and suggestions 'hbout the team's operation: --At what stage would the team get involved? After adjudica\u00ad tion? --would a team have input into whether or not a court case is filed? State's Attorneys have always considered t'his deci\u00ad sion to be their private domain. --The DCFS represent~tive should be highly experienced in child abuse and neglect treatment, a person with field experience. --Because there ate so many contractual agenCies, perhaps the team's contractual representative should be chosen on a case\u00ad by-case basis. --The team members' salaries coul~ be very costly. Cases of\u00ad ten come up for review in court' 10 or 12 times, so team mem\u00ad bership could be a full-time job. --Shouldn't the child's, serve on the team? --To avoid having people trav~l hundreds of miles, perhaps each region should decide ~6w many teams it needs. 6. Nahman Greenberg Dr. Greenberg serves both the University of Illiriois Medical \"Center's Department of Psychiatry and Illinois Masonic Medical Cen\u00adter's Child Abuse Unit for Studies, Education, and Services in -427-Chicago. He is also a consultant to DCFS and the Ci.ty of Chicago's Department of Health. In his prepared testimony, Dr. Greenberg called multidiscipl{~ nary services \"essential,1I but asked how the proposed teams would lIimprove on existing services and more important how do they com\u00ad pensate for serious gaps in clinical services. How do MD teams qualify in diagnostics and treatment planning.1I Dr. Greenberg won\u00ad dered what professional standards the team members would have to meet. Dr. Greenberg concluded that DCFS needs its own multidisciplinary teams available throughout the state that can address the wide range of assessment and interven\u00ad tional problems associated with maltreated children and their families. It is my professional judgement therefo~e that diagnostics, treat\u00ad ment planning, and case followup services, and resources must be strengthened, must be increased and properly remain within DCFS. The Me teams as proposed would better serve to educate communi\u00ad ties and bring about their input for improved planning and pro- ,~, grams of prevention. (emphasis added) In response to questioning, Dr. Greenberg reiterated that cli~ nical diagnostic work is incredibly complex and too much for a team. Instead, he felt, such teams shoUld be used to educate the public regarding the problem. He thought that 'the teams could be mandated, but he wanted the members' qualifications specified. He again called multidisciplinary input \"an essential concept.!' ..... 7. Gregory Coler Coler, Director of the Department of Children and Family Ser\u00ad vices, b~gan his prepared statement by applauding the Commission's comprehensive ,investigation of child abuse, saying, \"Seldom do gevernment commissions or agencies have the opportunity to explore a problem in such depth over an extended period of time.\" Coler expressed his pride over the Department's recent accom\u00ad plishments: the State Central Register,. the Child Abuse and Neg\u00ad lect Investigati,ons DeciSion Handbook, an\u00a2! the specialized Division of .Child Protection\" (DCP) teams with investigators and nurses as members~ Coler said these teams were a \"direct result of my dis';' cussions wifh the Commission. II He said, in fact, that, the Commis\u00ad sion's assistance had been liinvaluable\" to him. teams, Coler said, \"I a'gree with the Commission that medi\u00ad cal personnel, the po~ice, state's 4ttprneys, medical examiners, and other professionals in the community is' indispensable if we are to continue our progress in dealing with the child abuse problem.1I However, he said he wasn't sure \"you can legislate coope:tation.\" -42.8-(i' \" i) \\ I o During questioning, Coler'aired further reservations: --Who serves on th(~ teams needs to be further def ined, making sure that they 9re policymakers with authority and respon\u00adsibility. --What exactly are the roles of the Prescription? County outreach? Policy develop- 'ment? Resource deV'~lopment? Coler suggested that the best role for the teams would be to develop community resources and awareness and to develop better working relationships betwe~n hospitals, police, courts, and DCFS. --Because he doesn't want case' responsibili ty to be dif\u00ad fused, Coler is opposed to multidisciplinary teams getting directly involved in case treatment. He pOinted out that these are often life-and-death Situations, and DCFS is le\u00ad gally accountable for them. --Regarding cost and distribution, Coler said that such teams cost about $30,000 each per year, so 60 teams would cost about $1,800,000. Because abuse and neglect are not uniform\u00ad ly distributed throughout the state, Coler sriggested that incident reports be used to distribute the most teams to the areas with the greatest problems. In sum, Cole.r thought tha\u00b7t the multidisciplinary team concept has great merit, but that the teams' duties need to be refined. 8. Gabriella Cohen In his tes\u00b7timony, Director Coler mentioned H.E.L.P., Inc., which stands for Human Effe,ct:ive Living Programs. Gabriella Cohen i9 H.E.L.P\"., Inc. I s, Executive Director. Cohen explained that in 1981, DCFS awarded H.E.L.P., Inc. \"substantial grants to develop a coordinated, cooperative effort among all relevant organizations to identify, invest.igate, determine and use appropriate court in\u00ad volvement. This model began in the Chicago Police Department's Sixth Area and in J?Y 83 expanded to include CPD' s Fourth and Fifth area thus covering the nor,th s ide of Chicago.\" Cohen opened her statement by saying that \"No single viewpoint or professional expertise is\u00b7sufficient to addresl?, the multi\u00ad problematic nature. 'of these families.\" Cohen identified four procedural problems that the teams would have to face: a) ij b) If the teams review ill child abuse and neglect cases they will be reviewing many unfounded cases (4IS% of cases are . indicatE;!c1) HoW will the teams respond to' the 2.4 hour mandate -429-c) If the team acts only as a review it will depend on exist\u00ad ing workers for input information d) There is no current data on the case characteristics or the nature of the problems which cause an increase in the sever\u00ad ity of the abuse or which may lead to child deaths, nor is there adequate data on what significant factors indicate that a case is a high risk case. Therefore criteria for the review of only high risk cases is subjective. (Regarding these probll~ms, we offer the following comments. The teams will not review)all cases; they will review unusual cases Item \"d\" suggests tha't Cohen realizes the teams will not review\u00b7 all cases. Because they will review only unusual cases, the teams will handle cases only after DCFS workers have already fulfilled the 24- hour response mandate. Dependence on existing workers' information does not reduce the value of interdisciplinary review. And al\u00ad though review criteria are subjective, \u00b7this does not preclude their ~se ~n human situati~ns, where a certain amount of subjectivity ~nevJ.tab,le. ) . 9. James Hollandsworth Because the H.E.L.P. project operates in Area 6, our last wit\u00ad ness was Lt. Hollandsworth, Commanding Officer of the Area 6 Youth Division. He described the Youth Division's work with H.E.L.P., Inc., and then stressed the need for immediate investigation of child abuse cases by law enforcement agents. B. Conclusion The witnesses all agreed that inter-agency cooperation is es\u00adsential in dealing with the families- of abused and neglected chil~\\ d::en, and that mUltidisci~linary teams would enhance such coopera(.!: t~on. However, several OJ.. the witnesses had specific reservations about the implementation and ,operation of such t,eams. On March 8, 1983, Co-Chairmen Jaffe and Hastert introduced a bill in the House of RepresenJatives calling for mandatory imple\u00ad mentation of multidisciplinary teams. The Co-Chairmen then ar-' ranged to speak with experts in Colorado (see Chapter 8) regarding further specifics of implementation. Their conversations continue as this report is printed and the legislation is considered in the House. -430-J ,. , r o A. Conclusions Chapter 10 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Many changes have occurred in the child protection system since our investigation began. The Department of Children and Family Ser\u00ad vices, the state agency primarily responsible for child protection, has undergone major reorganization during the past five years. Be\u00ad cause the restructuring occurred while we were investigating the problem, we were in an excellent position to evaluate the impact of these changes. Overall, significant improvements have been made in Illinois' child protection efforts in the past few years, yet much remains to be done. That more improvements are needed should corne as no sur\u00ad prise: it has been only within the last 15 years th~t s?cial work and health professionals, much less the general publ~c, nave begun to recognize th~,extent of the problem. ~.' The conclusions and recommendations that we present here touch on the problem of child abuse and neglect as well as the profession\u00ad als who must combat the problem. We will look first at the problem, then at the system. 1. The Problem Our investigation began at a time when a great deal of public attention had been focused on what appeared to be an a.larming in\u00ad crease in child deaths due to abuse. The total number of reported child abuse and neglect cases not ending in death had also increased. On the surface the growing concern was warranted by the rising num\u00ad bers. Why were more and more parents beginning to abuse-~even kill-\u00ad their own children? And what could be done to reverse thJ.s apparent trend? These were two of the questions we were to address. These concerns were ba~ed on the apparently false assumption that there had been a significant increase both in. child abuse and in child abuse geaths. The fact \u00b7is that reported cases of abuse have increased steadily over the years, while reported cases of deaths resulting from abuse have been erratic from year ~o year. \" The real extent of the child abuse and neglect problem was im- possiple to, asc'ertaiIi because we could measure, for the most part, only repOl:'ted--not actual--cases. And, until Fis<?al Year 1~81, when certain amendments '. to the Abused and Neglecte,d CllJ.ldReport~ng Act were effective, av~n records of reports 6f 6hil~ ab~s~ and Child, abuse'deaths were not very reliable.. The<>unavaJ.labJ.lJ.ty of mean~ng- \"ful statistics makes it very difficult not only to devise any solu\u00ad tions, but also,iiiitialdy, to describe the proble~ i~self. ,Howe:rer, the expressed fear that. more and more parents a.re k~ll~ng theJ.r chl.l\u00ad dren should be quieted somewhat by the knowledge that pre-FY 81 de.ath totals are questionable .and the FY 82 totals are down from FY 81. -431'-\u00a7! tQ; g .\u00a5 I ! ..... , The ability to describe the child abuse and neglect problem depends on many factors. One factor is the definition, which must remain constant from one year to the next to make proper comparisons. Though most people have a common-sense understanding of what child abuse and neglect are and are not, translating this understanding into meaningful statutory or regulatory language is another matter. Consequently, in an ongoing search for a better definition,Inost states including Illinois have made many changes in the language defining the problem. The changes made in the definition in Illinois have been, we believe, improvements. But because definitions have changed in the last decadev there is a certain amount of variation in abuse statistics. Another source of variation due to the defini tior;.::i:nvol ves the way it is applied to individual incidents of suspected abuse. Illinois' definition is broadly constructed, leaving social workers or others wide discretion in whether or not to label('''') particular incident abusive. There are strong indications that~J:jCFS caseworkers do not apply the definition of child abuse and neglect consistently. Some caseworkers are more conservative than others in making case determinations. The differences, whether .. the result of differences in personal philosophi.es, training, or experience, limit the accuracy of abuse and neglect statistics. Another source of error in the statistics, which is more signi\u00ad ficant than variations due to the definition and its application, is our limited collective ability to detect child abuse. Until the 1960s, child abuse was not considered a particularly important problem. Except for the occasional serious case of abuse, or death resulting from abuse, neither professionals nor the gene,ral public heard much about battered children. It was believed th~t the problem generally was isolated to a few economically deprived families. Teachers, police, doctors, nurses, and other professionals were not aware of the scope of the problem, nor were they trained to recognize symptoms of abuse or neglect. Even\" if they might have suspected a child was being abused, professionals felt they had few options for intervention. Child abuse is a hidden problem since children general];1\u00a5' do not walk into a police station or into the principal's office to say they are being abused or neglected. This\u00b7 is especially true of children who are sexually abused at home. Children dO not report abuse for a variety of reasons. In fact, even when asked directly they qften do not respond truthfully to protect the abusive parent. It takes a skilled person to get many chil&ren to talk about their abuse. Expanded awareness of the child abuse problem grad1,lally ha:S led to increased knowledge about the sy:mptoms, allowing professionals ,to identify abuse more 'easily Because more people know' what to look for, more cases are being detected. This all leads to greater awareness, more knowledge, increased detection, and so on~ -432-, r I . i Beca,use of t,lles,e advances, increases in reports of abuse reflect, ,~n part, J.,ncJ.dents that previously remained hidden, not necessarlly real lncreases in the number of abuse incidents taking place. . ,The degree of reporting and the quality of centralized record keeplng also have I~ major impact on abuse statistics. We found that several years ago professionals were less willing than they are t~day to rep~rt suspected or detected abuse. Furthermore, in the past, ~rofessl0nalswho suspected abuse were less familiar with reportlng procedures than they are now. The creatio~ of the State,Central Register (SCR) within the Depar~ent of Chlldren and Famlly Services has led to impro~ed reportlng, more accurate central recording, and less confusion about ~~o ShOlUld l?e recei,ving reports. All must be conshdered part exp anatJ.on for lncreases in abuse figures. \":::-::.' , A final major factor that affects the statistics is the effec~ tJ.veness of t~e investigation done to verify or rule out reports of abuse. In thlS area, too, the Commission has no'ted significant adv~ncements. The qua~ity of uc~ed l?y DCFS of our l~v~s~lgatlon., ThlS ,lS .A=vldent especially since the creation of the D1V1Sl0~ of C~lld,protection (DCP) within DCFS last year. Because bett~r :nvestlgatl0ns are being conducted, the accuracy of the St~tlStlcs has further improved. Additionally, far fewer cases are belng \"l~st.\" That is, virtually all reports are being investigated, whereas In the past a large percentage of reports were never followed up. , I~ all of these areas--definition and its centralized record keeping; and investigation--~efinements' ~ve contlnued over the past years. Thus, we can no conciusions ~bout w~ether or no~ the proble~ neglect is lncrea~l~g, or remalnlng relatively the same. The ~urrent lncrease ln statistics reflects only the improvement seen ln all of those areas due to increased awareness of'the child abuse problem,. ~ ............ -, , Although gen~ral knowledge regarding child abuse has grown rapldly, the CO~lssion nevertheless must conclude that there remains much, we do not kI:\\<;>W about the problem. Therefore, as the system contlnues to acqul:e mor~ inform~tion and to become more effective, ~e ~hould contlnuedlncreases in the number of child abuse ln~ldents. Tl!e base this on several findings: (1) the definition of Chlld abuse lS not being evenly applied by all people who encounter t~e pro~lem; (2) many professionals who come in frequent contact wlth,chlldren, ~uch as health professionals and educators, still remaln large~y 19norant of \"the symptoms of abuse; (3) many mandated repqrter~ st:ll are not reporting their suspicions of abuse to DCFS\u00b7 (4) desp:te llnprov~m~nts, in publicizing the problem of child abuse ~. and de~p.).te the elJ.mlnatJ.on of much confusion by the establishment of a slngle toll-~ree number for reporting suspicions of child -433-pa SQ\u00a7 \u00a5\u00a5* abuse and neglect, much of the general Ptit)liC remains unaware of ~ts ability to report and to whom, or rema~.ns reluctant to get ~nvolved; and (5) even though the quality of investigations has ~m~roved markedly, many child welfare workers still lack essential sk~lls to gather and document credible evidence of abuse. 2. The System No si~gle agency bears total responsibility for protecting our state's ch~ldren. Although the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services plays a central role in combatting child abuse and neglect~ the responsibility ultimately is shared by literally hu~dreds of l~cal,and state government agencies, as well as by pr~vate organ~zat~ons and private citizens. In. fact, even though DCFS plays a centr~l role in ~ealing with th~ problem, the ,impact of that agency ac~~ng alone w~ll atways remain severely limited. As we have alre,~dy seen, DCFS must rely almost totally on P~opl~ other than its own employees to identify abuse initiallY. L~kew~se, DCFS must rely mainly on other agencies to provide treat\u00ad ment ,'to an abus~d, c~ild and abusive parents, even though DCFS reta~ns respons~b~l~ty for placement and for monitoring progress. For children to be protected adequately, all agencies and professionals, indeed all citizens, must work together toward that commo~ goal. What we found'during our investigation is that the agenc~es that should be operating in concert often work at cross purposes. The type of cooperation and coordination necessary to deal effectively with child abus'e does not exist. The Department of Children and Family Services itself must a~sum: much of the re~ponsibility for this. Apparently, from the t~me I...he agency was f~rst created it established the model for non\u00adcooperation. When we first started our investigation, we interviewed scores of poli~e, state's attorneys, judges, school officials, and health profess~onals. Many of those interviewed openly expressed hostility toward the Department. A common complaint was that DCFS would not cooperate even in providing feedback on what happened with cases referred to them, much less list),en to recommendations on how to handl,e a case or work wi,th the reporting agency. We were told that DCFS sometimes did not even follow up on cases referred to it. Criminal justice authori'ties also complained about DCFS case-') workers failing to refer serious cases of abuse to the police or State's Attorney's Office for criminal investigation and possible prosecution. , <;>ur investig~tion established that all of these complaints had val~d~~y. DCFS d~d not try to develop a coordinated approach to deal w~th child abuse incidents. Hiding hehind the excuse that their activities were confidential, DCFS employees often refused to r,eveal \"'hether or not they even were workin9 on a case reported to -434-I them. Frequently, confidentiality was raised when DCFS workers wanted to hide the fact they had done nothing. The agency was accountable to no one. l:l' The Commission-also found many examples of DCFS workers failing to notify proper law enforcement authorities about serious abuse incidents. In one case we reviewed, a l2-year-old girl had been raped by her mother's boyfriend. The ,PCFS worker closed the case after the mother promised she would not let her boyfriend back in the house. Anothe~ case involved a two-year-old girl who was discovered to have gonorrhea. The doctor who discovered the disease called DCFS. After interviewing several people, the DCFS case\u00ad worker closed the case. She had arrived at the incredible conclu\u00ad sion tbat the girl had contra.cted venereal disease \"from the toilet seat in a church.\" Neither of these cases was referred to law enforcement authorities, nor was there i~ny other follow up. Fortunately, while our investigation was underway, the Department began making important changes that are eliminating mos't of these problems. Particularly noteworthy has been the addition of the SCR. The Commission's evaluation of the register is a most positive one. People calling the central register using the single statewide phone number are told immediately whether or not there is sufficient information to begin an investigation. Mandated reporters, auto\u00ad matically in most cases, are now notified of DCFS's case determina\u00ad tions regarding reports of suspected abuse. And some mandated reporters, such, as police and physicians, who are authorized by law to take temporary custody of children they believe are in danger, hav~ full access to information contained in the central register. Another improvement has been a DCFS policy requiring that the approp;iate state's attorney be notified of certain serious abuse incidents. This has been carried one step futher in Chicago, where the Chicago Police Department is notified directly by the SCR of some reports that appear especially serious. These major accomplishments notwithstanding, there remains much DCFS CQuld do to promote further the cooperation and coordination necessary for effective child protection. One thing the agency has not done that we believe could help eno.rmously is to create a statewide network of community-based multidisciplinary teams. Such teams have proved effective in several other states in fostering coopera\u00ad tion, identifying service gaps, evaluating treatment plans, moni\u00ad toring case handling,(,educating mandated reporters and community members, helping to solve administrative problems, developing new services, dr~fting procedure for case handling, recommending refer\u00ad rals to juvenile or criminal courts, and coordinating the activities of mUltiple agencies that might become involved in complicated abuse or neglect cases. Such teams should be especially useful in metropolitan areas where a formal method must be implemented to establish continuing cross-agency links. In less populated areas, we found that DCFS workers are much more effective i'n establishing and cultivating -435- Q\u00a5J\u00a7 .+ i\\ informal ties with other agencies than are workers in the Chicago area. Yet even downstate, gaps exist; if the caseworker leaves the agency or is transferred, his contacts are lost to DCFS. Teams allow for continuity in the links between all appropriate agencies and segments of the community. It is the intent of the current law that DCFS establish mul tidis\u00ad ciplinary teams. Unfortunately, the Department has hal;>hazardly set up a variety of teams in only a few areas. It also has established a - few teams from within its own staff. These efforts fall far short qf what the legislature envisioned and what is necessary. Aside from inadequate coordination, another major problem is the almost ,non-existent child abuse prevention effort. As we out-\u00b7 lined earlier in this report, Brian Fraser identified the following factors that, together, are likely to lead to child abuse: (l) one one or both parents have been abused as children; (2) the abusive parents have no friends, neighbors, or relatives to calIon in a ~ime of crisis; (3) the parents have unrealistic expectations of their children; and (4) a crisis occurs. These four factors imply a number of possible strategies for prevention. The first factor could lead to an educational campaign encouraging people who had been abused as children to seek counsel~ ling to help heal the psychololgical wounds, or one that would encour-J age children who are now being abused to contact DCFS. Educators, If police, health professionals, and others all could be'come involved in similar efforts. . ' The second and fourth factors would seem to imply establishiI1.g . more crisis intervention hotlines at the community level. The third would seem to imply educating people about the developmental stage$ of childhood through public service broadcasts and school curricuilL. These are only a few of the possibilities. There are a host of '!i others. The Commission found, however, that virtually nothing is being done to develop, much less implement, a comprehensive prevention strategy. There are a few piecemeal efforts.\" Some hospitals teach young mothers a few basics about early childhood d~velopment during their brief hospital stay and then visit the mothers a few weeks after they take their infants horne. A few high schools offer elective basic parenting classes. Crisis intervention hotlines have been set up for a variety of purposes in a few communities. And some private groups as well as police departments offer brief classes to young children to help them recognize inapproprfate discipline or sexual conduct and to instruct them on what to do if it. happens to them. The groups and agencies that are working hard in the area of prevention deserve our recognition and support. We applaud them. But in assessing the prevention efforts from a statewide pe~spective, the energy being devoted is pitifully small. -436-'l'\" r r ! j Two other problems that we already mentioned in part are the detection and reporting of child abuse and neglect. There are far too many professionals who regularly corne in contact with children who remain ignorant of the symptoms of child abuse. Moreover, far too many of these professionals are untrained in hovr, reassuringly, to get children to talk about their abuse. \"Initial training~and con\u00ad tinuing education in these skills are pr~ctically n~n-existent for the medical, law enforcement, and educat10n profess10ns. Some medical specialists, especially in some hospital emergency rooms, some counsellors or teacher~, and some specialists in a few police departments are experts in these areas. The vast m.ajorit~ h~ve not learned even the basics. Even most welfare workers.1n DCFS S1.ster agency, the Illinois Department of Public Aid, do not know the funda\u00ad mentals of detecting abuse, nor do they even look for it. As for reporting, our investigators interviewed many 'mandated reporters who were not aware that they had a legal obligation to report suspicions of child abuse. Many others, we f~und, w~r~ aware of their responsibility but chose not to report the1r SUsp1c1~ns. In some schools we visited, policies had been set up that requ1re teachers to report their suspicions only to the principal, who then would decide whether or not to notify DCFS. Such policies do not meet the requirements of the law, under which mandated reporters have the obl~gation to notify DCFS themselves. When we started 'our investigation, we found that many police and medical examiners or coroners. were confused about how to proceed with reports of child deaths due to abuse. Some reported these to DCFS others did not. The confusion seems to have been eliminated, howe~er, apparently because of the creation of the statewide hotline and attendant media campaigns. The problem of non-reporting appears to be particularly con\u00ad centrated among private physicians and dentists. Most of t~em are apparently aware of their obligation but do not live up to 1t. Perhaps one reason many mandateq reporters flout the law is that Illinois, like many other states, does very little vigorously to 'enforce the law. In fact, no one we intervi,ewed could think of an example of a mandated reporter being punished for not reporting. An area that has shown significant improvement during the last five years has been the investigation of suspected cases of abuse. When we began our investigation, we were ~hocked by ~ome of ~he p poor investigati.ons that by Ch1ld Protect1ve SerV1ces (C_S) workers. Some 'reports of suspected abuse were not even accepted. Others were not followed up. Some m.i\".ght be follow7d u.p, ~ut days later. Some were investigated, but the cases were handled 1n a sl1pshod, un~ro\u00ad fessional fashion. Few cases were handled well. To describ~ many of these investigation.s as incompetent (~would be generous. Basic facud were not recorded in the case file. Notes were often written illegibly on the back of envelopes or other scraps of paper. Even the reason why an investigation was being conducted sometimes was not recordeq. Caseworkers often did not have the -437-vaguest notion of how to gather and document evidence, how to con\u00ad duct a fact finding interview, or how to report their observations. The very idea of having to support with documented facts their final determination and recommendation in a case seemed foreign to many caseworkers. These problems were most eviderlt in Cook Courtty. Else\u00ad where in the state, the investigations were generally better but still somewhat deficient in proper documentation. Fortunately, improvements have been made. Shortly after our investigation began we started to notice that better investigations were being done. This was' primarily the result of CPS training efforts that had begun earlier. However, further improvement did not come about until the implementation of the Child Abuse and Neglect Tracking System, which centralized quality control and accountability for follm\"'~up within the SCR. Af,ter some problems during early implementation and the initial training period, the overall quality of investigations and documentation has significantly improved. Last year DCFS moved toward further improvement with the creation of DCP. This brought about the needed separation between the investi\u00ad gation and service delivery functions of the agency. Previously', CPS workers were expected to do both, which resulted in a confusion of roles. Preliminary indications are that cases are being handled more expeditiously ahd documented more fully. The deficiencies have not all disappeared. Many of the DCP investigators still are not properly documenting information for possible use in courts. Some also need further training in how tU testify during cour.t hearings and trials. Many cases have been in limbo for varying periods because of a DCFS policy that workers physically see and interview every member of the immediate family. This requirement has resulted in Unnecessary stagnation of cases \", that could be closed. Finally, there are problems in transferring cases from DCP to CPS follow-up workers. The case files do not contain adequate information to allow for a smooth transition between di:visions. A 1 though DCFS i.s the agency primarily responsible for conducting investigations, it would be a mistake to focus solely on what DCP could do to improve investigations. Many mandated reporters could help~\"iJi1pxove abuse investigations by fully documenting their obser\u00ad vations and supplying the documentation to DCFS. The police could be especiallY helpful in this regard b~cause of their training and because DCFS can legally delegate an entire investigation to them. Unfortunately, not all agencies are assisting as completely as they could, even when asked. After the inv~stigation is completed, a decision must be made on what action to take, if any. This leads to our next major block of findings: formal interventi'on, treatment, and monitoring. One optiqn is t6 refe~ a case0for criminal prosecution u depending on the seriousness of the case. HR 776 mentions that there -438-r I 1\\ , I had been demands for stiff new penalties fqr parents who abuse or neglect their children. The Commission has determined that current law provides appropriate sanctions and penalties. No new criminal laws appear to be needed. The problem is not in the laws but in the quality of the investigations conducted by DCFS workers and the absence of a con\u00ad tinuing working relationship between DCFS and criminal justice agencies. As we said, DCFS' revised reporting policies and the creation of DCP are steps in the right direction. Mutually accept\u00ad able procedures and agreements need to be worked out between DCFS and criminal justice agencies throughout the state. Because cooperative relationships do not exist to any great extent, children end up being victimized twice, first by their abusive parents and second by the system that subjects them to an unnecessary series of insensitive interviews by social workers, police, and prosecutors, culminating in a bewildering and fr.ightening courtroom experience for which they rarely have been prepared. Pilot projects throughout the country have demonstrated that where a strong cooperative relationship exists between criminal justice and social service agencies, serious trauma can be eliminated. A current DCFS-funded project in Chicago aims at creating a model for cooperative agreements between DCFS, private treatment providers, the police, state's attorneys, and the courts with respect to handling sexual abuse cases. Preliminary indications are that the program is successful. We hope that similar programs will be started throughout the state and that the focus will be expanded to cover other forms of abuse, not just sexual abuse. In addition to, or instead of, criminal action, a case can be handled in Juvenile Court. Possible trauma to the child is not as great a problem in Juvenile Court because of the less stringent evidence requirements and the less formal nature of the proceedings. Nevertheless, here too, sensitivity to the child's needs is often lacking. A third possible alternative is for the parents voluntarily to accept a treatment plan recommended by DCFS rather than go through the court \"process. This option is supposedly selected only in the least severe cases. On the surface this might appear to be the best alternative; the child is spared the need to testify, and much of the ti,me always involved in., ei ther juvenile or criminal prosecl;1- tiona is saved. We found in our investigation, however, .. that th~s option 'is often misused. We discovered many instances of serious cases that were not re\u00b7ferred to court because of a voluntary agree\u00ad ment. Too often the parents later b~eak the agreement. In the meantime, documentation often has not been adequately prepared and evidence has not been preserved. Thus, DCFS frequently finds itself in no position to later refer the case for either civil or criminal prosecution. Since the formation of DCP, we do 'not know to what extent this is still a problem. \" -439-( iZ 144 9 \u00a5+* No matter how the case is handled, ,if there is a ~inding of abuse .or neglect, some kind of treatment plan is either formally or informally prepared. The plan might involve counselling for the family, homemaker or day care services, temporary out-of-home place\u00ad mentfor the child, or a range of other services. Generally, DCFS caseworkers do not provide any of these services directly. Outside agencies are contracted to provide them. DCFS workers primarily perform a case management function. If a person is convicted in criminal court and is placed on probation, DCFS generally will be responsible for providing services to the offender if he will remain' in the home and if part of the plan involves keeping the family intact or eventually reuniting the family. This responsibility is sometimes carried out in conjunction with county probation departments. We learned that if the offender is incarcerated, he rarely will receive treatment, therapy, or counselling of any kind. No follow\u00ad up is done by anyone once this person leaves prison. If a case is handled by voluntary agreement or in Juvenile Court, DCFS alone is responsible for arranging services. The judge must be kept informed of progress in cases he adjudicated, but once he enters a finding and turns custody over to DCFS, it is DCFS' responsibility to arrange whatever services are appropriate~ The Commission found several problems with DCFS' function of arranging and then monitoring services. First, we found many gaps in the availabi'lity of treatment service,s, yet DCFS has not developed a way to identify the full extent of these gaps through a statewide needs assessment. Consequently, a full continuum of services is not available to abusive parents and abused children. This is one reason for some of the inappropriate placements that we discovereq, during our investigation. Another reason is that many caseworkers l are unfamiliar with the services available. . DCFS' network of treatment services was built haphazardly. Rather than identifying a need, sending out a request for proposal (RFP), seeking bids to meet the need, and then entering into a contract with the agency that offered to provide the best service, DCFS' network was constructed the other way around. A private agency would approach someone at DCFS and offer to provide a specified service. DCFS would then decide whether or not to enter into a contract. Rarely \"were programs designed to DCFS specification or open for bidding. This also resulted in disparities in what was paid to different agencies for similar services. A new policy of the Department that requires competitive bidding on RFPs has not been in force long enough for us to know if these .. problems will be eliminated soon. At least it appears to lead in the right direction. Another problem with the services is the failure by DCFS to evaluate. and mon:i,tor the performance' of '.\" I ! I caseworkers may individually review the treatment provided to clients, but the agency as a whole does not. We were frequently told that such evaluations cannot be.performed because \"success\" is impossible to define, yet this position is totally unsupported in the literature. Researchers have been evaluating such programs for years, and we believe it is time for DCFS to do so. DCFS should stqpwasting money on programs that do not work or coul.d be improved. The monitoring of services by DCFS workers has improved considerably since our investigation began, but again more improve\u00ad ment is needed. Several years ago DCFS did such poor case monitoring that the agency often lost track of its wards. This should not happen anymore, not only because of the Child Abuse and Neglect Tracking Sy!?tem, but also because there is a case conference on each out-of-home . placement every six months. ,', The conference is cha~red by a case review administrator who evaluates the casets progress. Unfortunately, cases where the child remains in the home are not subject to similar reviews. Even with the periodic reviews, however, we found that the majority of caseworkers have too little contact with the contractual agencies providing services to their clients. Furthermore, we found that caseworkers do not properly maintain files on their clients. The last area we will address in these findings and conclusions is the overall administration o~ DCFS. The Commission would like to commend DCFS Director Gregory Coler for the job he has done in engineering major improvements in his agency's operational and administrative effectiveness. When we began our investigation of child abuse, the administra\u00ad tion of DCFS was chaotic. There was virtually no central control. The agency functioned more as a loose confederation of independent fiefdoms than as a single department. Resources were sorely lacking. Reports of abuse were often not investig~ted. Caseworkers ,lacked fundamental training. Files were frequently misplaced. DCFS was in worse shape than any public agency this Commission has ever investigated. In the last few years the Department has gone through a trans\u00ad formation~ It barely resembles the same agency. Nevertheless, several major problems pers~st. The Departlnent cites again and again budgetary deficiencies for many of these problems. At the same time, the Auditor G~;neral continues to cite DCFS\u00a3or its '. failure to collect funds due it, Its failure to make use of federal funding for which it is eligible, and its failure to explore additional funding possibilities. Despite significant improvements, DCFS continues to mishandle cases of, abuse and neglect. We 'have identified several reasons for this. First, many ca..seworkers require more training. Second, \" supervision of the caseworkers is poor.

B. Legislative Recommendations 'i I I. , of Multidisciplinary Child Mandato.ry Implementat~on , _ a.

II \" , l'team approach is h d termined that the multidisc~p ~n~ry abuse and neglect. the b::t ::~hO~ of dealing with incidents of c~~ld -442,.. n ~ J ~ i t \\, I Multidisciplinary teams are not only desirable, they are feasible. Their use assures the most comprehensive and coordinated care avai.l\u00ad able to abused and neglected children and their families . Coopera\u00ad tion and communication between agencies intervening in child abuse anCi neglect cases are essential if the problem is to be dealt with effectively. (See Chaptel? 8, which discusses the purpose and functions of mUltidisciplinary teams, as well as their success in several of the states we ViSited.) Unfortunately, despite the addition of Section 7.1 to the Reporting Act, ef,fective July 1, 1980, DCFS has failed to begin using such teams in the manner,it shOUld be. Its failure to do so can be traced to the statutory discretion accorded the decision\u00ad makers within DCFS (II [tJo the fullest extent feasiblell), as well as to the general language of the statute. These statutory shortcomings have tended to undermine the intent of the General Assembly that the issues of child abuse and neglect prevention, identification, and treatment be addressed as a joint effort. . ,Accordingly, we reCOmmend that the discretionary language of Sect~on 7.1 of the Reporting Act be deleted, so that DCFS will have an affirmative duty to implement IImultidisciplinary case diagnostic, case handling, case management, and policy planning teams.\" Also, the language of Section 7.1 must be made more specific to guide DCFS in the development and use of multidisciplinary teams. At the least, such teams should consist of the following permanent members: (I) a DCFS employee, who Would serve as the team coordinator, (2) a representative from any other public or priVate agency under contract with DCFS for the provision of serVices, (3) -'a .representative from the medical profession, whether it be a PhysiCian, a member of any loca~public health agency, a hospital social worker, a registered nurse, or a qlinical Psycholoaist, (4) a representative from the local school dlstrict, (5) a lo~al Assis\u00ad tant State's Attorney, (6) a repJ:iesentative of a local law enforce\u00ad ment agency, and (7) a representative of the local lay community. Each team vlould be responsible for overseeing all cases of child abuse and neglect occurring in a designated geographic area of the State. There should be no less than one team for every 200,000 population. The minimum terms of service on such teams shOUld be one year. However, additional consulting members could be appointed by the team to serve on a case-by-pase basis. Such teams must have some decision-making authority in the treatment plan and not function in only an advisorial capacity. To avoid confusion and ineffiCiency, however, DCFS must retain ultimate responsibil:i,ty for overseeing all reports of child abuse and neglect. b. Access to Statutorily Confidential DCFS Records \" Section 11 of the Abused and Neglected ChildB.eporting Act . ~ -443-...... ...------ -~----- ------------.......,....-~--~~- ~ (Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 23, ,r 2061) provides that II [a] 11 records con\u00ad cerning reports of child abuse and neglect and all records generated a~ a result of such ,reports, shall be confidential and shall not be d~sc~osedexcep~ as specifically autJ;~:ized by this Act or other appl~cab~e law. Access to ten spec~f~cally ,enumerated categories of age~cleS and persons is authorized in Section ll~l of the Report~ng Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 23, ,r 2061.1). ~~' ,For members of child protection multidisciplinary teams to prov~de the services outlined in Section 7.1 of the Reporting Act, they must hC;ve access to the recprds made confidential by Section 11. Accord~ngly, a subsection (11) should be added to Section 11 1 of the Reporting Act, to read as follows: \"~ll) All members of m~ltidisciplinary case diagnostic, case hand\u00ad Ilng, case management, and policy planning teams working in con\u00ad junction with the Department.\" 2. Legislative Access to Statutorily Confidential DCFS Records House Resolution 776 directed this Commission to\" examine lithe r~sponsibil~ties, activities, and records of all agencies that deal Wl. tJ; the, chl.ld abuse problem. II In our attempt to fulfill this legl.slatl.ve mandate, we encountered many obstacles due to the reluctance of DCFS and child care agencies under c~ntractwith DCFS tO,allow us access to their records. This led to unnecessary delays ~n completing,this investigation, which relied heavily on the use,of ca~e~tudl.es to evaluate the child abuse and neglect system ~n Illl.nol.s. ~ . Clearl\u00a5, the i~te~t of the bar l.tself an~ l.ts comml.SSl.ons and committ~es xrom access to such ' recor~s, l.n that access is necessary to monitor the activities ofi' agencl.es that look to the General Assembly for their appropriations. Beyond the issue of intent, there is some confusion,and possi\u00ad blY,even,a direct conflict, between two present laws regarding legl.slatl. v,e ~ccess to ~CFS records. Section ,:11.1 of and ~eglec~ed ~hl.ld,Reportl.ng (Ill. Ch. 23, ,r 2061.1) oml.ts the General.Assembly from those ten categories. of a~encl.es and persons author~zed access to II [a]ll records con-, cernl.ng ~eports of child abu~e and neglect and all records generated as a result of such reports. However, Section 35.1 of the DCFS Act I~Ill. Rev. Stat. CJ;., 23, ,r 5035.1) provides, in relevant part, that ~t]he ca~e,a~d cll.nl.cal records of patients in Department super\u00ad Vl.s~d.facl.ll.tl.es, the Department, children receiving or applYl.ng f<;>r other servl.ces, persons receiving or applying for other servl.ces,?f the Department, and Department reports of' inquiry or abuse to chl.ldren shall be disclosed by the Director olf the Depar~ent only to proper la~l enforcem(;'!}J;d\"-bfficials, individuals authorl~ed,by court, the Illinois General Assembly or anyconunittee or comml.SSl.on th~reof, and to such other persons and for such\" , reasoI'l;,S. as the Dl.rector added.]\" , ; , .~ ! , I Many questions arise regarding the interpretation of these two statutory provisions, and how they are to be construed together. We can envision the necessity, at some point in the future, of seeking a court decision if the law is not amended. Because court intervention has not yet become a necessity, we feel that the law should be amended now. Furthermore, the Model Child Protection Act (promulgated by the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, an agency under the United States Department of Health and Human Services), on which the Illinois Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act is based, spec i\u00ad fi9ally provides that access to records concerning reports of child abuse and neglect and all records generated as a result of such reports shall be given to any appropriate state or local official responsible for administration, supervision, or legislation relating to the prevention and tr~atment of abuse and neglect, when they are carrying out their official functions. Illinois law has incorpora\u00b7ted every exception to the confidentiality of child abuse and neglect records save this one. The comment to the Model Act sta~~s: \"If central register and other records are to be used to improve child protective services through monitoripg and research, it is impera\u00ad tive that the data collected so painstakingly. and at such a great expense should be available to outsiders including legislators.\" Also relevant to this discussion is the fact that Section 11.1 of the Reporting Act was amended effective January 1, 1982, to add \"[l]aw enforcement agencies, physicians, courts and child welfare agencies in other states \" to the list of persons and agencies that have access to otherwise confidential records of child abuse and neglect (Public Act 82-453) (emphasis added). It is inappro\u00ad priate that out-of-state officials should have access to Illinois records of child abuse and neglect, when the Illinois General Assembly is denied such access. Accordingly, Section 11.1 of the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act should be a~ended to add the General Assembly to the list of those persons and agencies that have access to child abuse and neglect records. This amendment would add a new subsection (12) to Section ll~'l of the Reporting Act (our previous legislative .recolnmendation with respect to multidisciplinary teams would add new ~ubsectiol1 (11\u00bb, to read as follows: (12) The Illinois General Assembly or any committee ur commission thereof; provided however, that individual members of the General Assembly shall not have access to the records described in Section 11 unless such member is acting as a member of a committee or commission of the General Assembly and the info;-mation is needed to advance the legislative purpose of such cowmittee or co~ission, 3. Mandatory Reporting of Certain Child Abuse and Neglect Cases to Appropria,te State's Attorney During our investigation we 'received many complaints from officials of various polic~ departments and state's attorney's offices about the failure of DCFS to s~pply them 'with' abuse and -445-A 4) i JQ l :11 ! .t, .' neglect reports of which they should have been apprised. Certainly not,every case of abuse or neglect received by the DCFS eState Central RegJ.ster need be or should be reported to' law enforcement officials. however, we have documented reluctance on the part of some DCFS ' workers to report any case of abuse or neglect, no matter how severe. Apparent~y, some DCFS workers feel --unjustifiably __ that they, as socJ.a~ service professionals, are adequately equipped to handle ,a~y case. of abuse or neglect without the assistance of other agencJ.es havJ.ng a differe,1,1t orientation. Currently, DCFS, by its own rule, is supposed to report certain cas7s of abuse or,ne'llect I?CFS and Sta~e,\" ;:lAttorney' 5 offices is so J.mportant that reportJ.ng of certaJ.n\\_,':,;3,ses should not only be required by a d7partmental ru~e but also by state statute. First, a law is les~ l:-kely than ~n important consideration with DCFS because its ~J.rec~orshJ.p,h~s changed so often.) Second, failure to report ,~ertaJ.n specJ.~J.ed cases to the State's Attorney in violation of a law,c~uld ~ubJect the offending DCFS employee to charges for off:-cJ.al mJ.scortduct (Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 38, ~ 33-3): \"A public offJ.cer or ~ploye7 commits misconduct when, in his official ~apacity, he . Ca) [J.]nten~J.onally or recklessly fails to perform d~ty as,requJ.red by of vJ.olatJ.ng thJ.s provision forfeits his employment and commits a Class 3 felony.} T~erefore, we recommend that the Abused and Neglected Child ReportJ.ng Act be amended to add a new section 4.2 (Ill. Rev. Stat. C~. ,23\" prQPosed ~I 2054.2) to DCFS fJ.eld perronnel, immediately refer to the appropriate State s A~torney for consl,l,eration of criminal investigation or other actJ.on, the following types of reports: (1) reports in which a child is dead on arrival at or dies after admission to a hospital as a result of suspected abuse or neglect; (2) reports in which the harm to the child suspected td be abused or neglected is severe; such as, but not Ij,mited to: multiple or spiral fractures, third degree burns, and subdural hematoma; (3) reports in which credible evidence is \u00a3ound that a child has been abused a second time, regardless of severity; (4) reports of physical injury when the\"evidenc~ ind;i.cates that the child has been tortured; (5) reports in which a child is the alleged victim of sexual abuse; or (6) reports in which the child suspected to be abused or -446-6) neglected is in need of protection beyond that which can be provided through comprehensive protecti~e casework services. Provision should be made in this added section that the require\u00ad ment that these specific 'cases must be reported to the appropriate State's Attorney does not preclude the reporting of other cases if, in the caseworker's discretion, such action is deemed prudent. 4. Civil and Criminal Penalties for Mandated Reporters Who Fail to Report We have listed, in Section C (Subsection 9) of Chapter 3, all persons required by Section 4 of the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 23, 11 2054) to report to DCFS whenever they have \"reasonable cause to believe a child known to them(\\ in their professional or official capacity may be an abused or neglected child.\" However, no sanctions for failure to report are provided in the Act itself. During our investigation we documented the failure of mandated reporters to report even severe cases of child abuse and neglect. For example, the case study entitled ,,\"Peter\" included in Chapter 5 (Section F) details how three mandated reporters (two hospitals and one medical examiner) failed to make legally required reports to DCFS after Peter's death, because each assumed--incorrectly-\u00ad that the other already .had reported. DCFS, consequently, did not learn of Peter's death due to susoected parental abuse and neglect until five months after the death:' As a result, Peter's younger sister was in the custody of her parents all that time without even any supervision by DCFS. Such laxity cannot be tolerated. Statutory civil and criminal penalties for failure to report, already enacted in a majority of states, would help alleviate the problem,of non-reporting. Mandated reporters would be less hesitant about reporting , suspected cas7s of abuse and neglect if they knew they would be subJect to penaltJ.es fOt failure to report. Presently, sanctions such as suspension or revocati~n of,one's professional license for willful failure to report do eXJ.st for certain mandated reporters. These sanctions are provided in 'the individual acts, relating to the licensure of such professionals. (The Reporting Act, however, makes no reference to these other ~cts and their discretionary penalties for failure to report approprJ.ate cases. ) Similarly, those mandated reporters who are public officers or employees may be criminally liable for \"official misconduct\" (Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 38, 11 33-3), when in their official capacity they \" [i] ntentionally or recklessly [fa'il] to perform any mandatory duty as reguired to law. '~, Official misconduct constitutes a Class 3 felony, and conviction results in the forfeiture of the person's office or employment. Not every mandated reporter falls within the purview of these --447-54 _0;; \u00a5+* potential sanctions. Therefore, the Commission recommends that Section 4 of the Reporting Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 23, \" 2054) be arne.nded to provide certain criminal and civil penalties for mandated reporters who fail to fUJfill their statutory duty to repqrt sus\u00ad pected cases of child abuse and neglect. Without these penalties, the Reporting Act remains unenforceable in many instances. 5. Clarification of I'nterspousal Privileges The difficulties involved in establis[iing\" guilt beyond a rea\u00ad sonable doubt in a child abuse case in crilninall\\ court are well known. Most states, including Illinois, h'l:ive al)rogated the status of one or more privileged communications, 'suc!} ~s those between doctors and patients, social workers and cliBnts~ and husbands and wives, in order to alleviate some of these trial problems. In Illinois criminal cases, a \" husband and wife may testify for or against each other: provided, that neither may testify as to any qommunication or admission made by either of them to the other or as to any conversation between them during marriage, except in cases where .. the interests of their child or children are directly involved \" (Emphasis added.) (Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 38, \" 155-1.) It came to the attention of the Commission through interviews with assistant state's attorneys that the language of this statute is a bit unclear as to whether foster children, step-children, or other children in their care, would be included by the statute above. Since the statutory definitions of \"abused child\" and \"neglected child\" appear to include foster children, step-children, children for whom a husband and wife are babysitting, etc., the intent of the legis\u00ad lature would be best served by adding the following clarifying language to ~ 155-1: . except in cases where . the interests of their child or children, or of any child or children in either party's\" care, custody, or control, are directly invOlved...... (Amendment underscored.) Because the reasons for clarifying the abrogation of interspousal privilege in c~iminal cases applies to civil cases as well, the Commission recommends that Section 8-801 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 110, \" 8-801) be amended as follows: In all civil actions, husband and wife may testify for or against each other, provided that neither rray testify as to any' conununication or admission made by either of them to the other or as to any conver\u00ad sation between them during marriage, except in actions between such husband and wife, ,and in actions where the custody, support, health or welfare of their children or children in either party's care, custody, or control, is directly in issue, and as to matters in which either has acted as agent for the other.\" (Amendment underscored.) -448-I I ~ 1 .. ,:I( 1 I i f Standard of Proof in Parental Unfitness Proceedings 6. As discussed in Section C (Subsection 5 f) of Chapter 3, the standard of proof in proceedings to terminate th~ right~ of parents and free a child for adoption was changed effectl.v7 January 1, 1982. Public Act 82-437 amended Section 5-9 of the Juvenl.le Court Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 37, '1 705-9) by reducing the staJ.?-dard of proof that must be met when seeking to terminate parental rl.ghts fr~m \" \"clear and convincing evidence\" to a \"preponderance of the e!1~enCe (unless the parents are minors, mentally ill or mentally defl.crent). The u.s. Supreme Court decision in Santosky v. Kramer, (455 u.s. 745), issued in March of this year, has rendered thl.s reduc\u00ad tion in the standard of proof unconstitutional. In that case, a, New York law requiring that only a \"fa~r preponderance.of ~he evl.\u00ad was declared invalid. It,was held t~at the Due proce~s Clause requires states to support 1ts.allegatl.ons by at leas~ clear and convincing evidence\" before the rl.ghts of parents to thel.r natural child are completely and irrevocably severed. Accordingly, the Commission recommends that Section 5-9 of the Juvenile Court Act be amended by requiring that a finding of parental unfitness be based upon \"clear and convincing evidence.\" 7. Deletion of \"ObscenityCl Requirement in Chilg Pornography Prosecutions. This legislative recommendat~on. arises not f:om the findings of this report, but from the Comml.SSl.on report entl.tled Sexual . Exploitatibn of Children, published in 1980. Howe'ver, beca~se tne decision of the u.s. Supreme Court in New York y. Fer~er ~4=>5 U.S. 904) I rendered July 2, 1982, <?la:ified se:reral const~tut.l.onal questions regarding the proscrl.ptl.on of chl.ld pornography, we are making this recommendation here. That case, as well as the Illinoi~chilq pornography statute (Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 38, \" 11-20a) and other child pornography laws, are discussed in Section E (Subsection 4) of Chapter I., For a better understanding of the implications of the Ferber case, the reader is directed to that earlier discussion . To make prosecutions for child pornography. easier, the Commission recommends that SUbsections (e) \"Inte~p:t'e~ati0J.?- of .' II Evidence\" (d) \"Prima Facie Evidence,\" and (e) 'Affl.rmatl.ve Defel:'lses of the child pornography statute be amended :b~ de),et,ing all references to obscerd ty and the necessity \"of the State to prove the elem7nts of obsceni ty (set forth in Ill.

'. / '1 8. Child Abuse Prevention Centers. and Service Programs While victims of other forms of domestic' violence currently have a variety of temporary shelters and service programs available, children who are victims of abuse from both parents have no place in the community to turn. The Commission recommends that DCFS be required to administer such shelters and service programs for abused or neglected children or to provide for\u00b7, their administration by certain outside agencies.' To be eligi1?le for DCFS funding, those wishing to implement a shel\u00adter or serV1.ce program should be required to provide a minimum of 20% in matching funds. In this manner, local governments and the private sector will be shown that they will receive needed support \" from the state if they are willing to take the initiative in this important area. c. General Recommendations 1. DCFS should prepare a detai;il.ed statewide ulan for the prevention of child abuse and neglect. The plan sh~uld identify the role that each agency, type of agency, and profession ideally should play and should include guidelines for implementing pre\u00ad vention programs as well as sample literature for promoting them. We. re70mmend that DCFS extend its focus on abuse prevention beyond agenC1.es and professionals that deal with children to include lo\u00ad cal programs and citizens throughout the state. DCFS should assess to what degree programs aimed at awareness anUiprevention of abuse and neglect exist, and take steps to coordinate and promulgate those efforts statewide. 2 ~ In conj unction wi th the establishment of multidisciplinary teams, DCFS should develop cooperative agreements and procedures, in writing; '\\,>lith all appropriate criminal justice agencies regard-,: ,ing how cases of abuse and neglect will be handled. 3~ DCFS should strengthen its in-service training follow-up staff should be provided by experienced state1s a~t,?rneys and police investigators to improve interviewing, . report wr1.t1.ng, case documentation, and case presentation skills. ~CP and CPS follow-up supervisors should receive training not only 1.n .. these areaSj but also, along wi th supervisory employees through\u00ad out .7;f-he Depaxtment, in performance management techniques .. 4. A state-wide resource needs assessment should be conducted immediately by DCFS. DCFS should issue requests for proposals based on that assessment to establish treatment programs that would fill the many gaps in resoUrces available to' abusive parents and abused children. DCFS needs to develop, immediately, mor8 contractual re\u00ad pources to handle cases of child sexual abuse and troubled adoles\u00adcents. -450-r I t r I f f , ., I :., r ~, ~ I 5. (; DCFS should immed;iately revise its entixe filing system. At a minimum, the documents' in each folder should be filed con\u00ad sistently and should be well secured to prevent case data from being lost. Each +ile should also provide for data entry of all contacts made with the client or subject of the case file. Case\u00ad work supervisors should be held accountable fq,r ensuring that these files are accurate and complete. .' 6. DCFS should reestablish its unit of program evaluation to check on contractual agencies. Individual cases should be monitored, as should the operations of contractual agencies as a whole. Agen\u00ad cies should be required to submit appropriate reports on time or face the cancellation of their contracts. It should be made clear to DCFS workers that part of their function is to collect appropriate documentation, file it properly, and act on it promptly. DCFS should hold contractual agencies account.able for the services provided to individual clients in a systema\u00b7tic, review-oriented manner. 7. DCFS should develop a somewhat increased direct service capability so that it can adequately handle clients who present problems that cannot be adqressed by available contractual agency .' services, or that could be better served by the close supervision of DCFS. .8. DCFS should develop a mechanism to deal systematically with problems identified at. the caseworker level. 9. The Office of Administrative Case Review should examine periodically all open cases within DCFS. Presently, the Office re\u00ad views only. those cases in which the child is placed out of the home; cases involving in-home family maintenance should also be reviewed. A review of all open cases will help prevent any cases from \"fall\u00ad ing through the cracks.\" 10. DCFS supervisors should function as supervisors and not as super-caseworkers. Attentiop must be paid to the method that caseworkers have used to resolve a case as well as to the result that they have .. achieved. \" l' I i: 11. DCFS\":'should significantly improve the quality of its in- ternal investigations to ensure both accuracy and fairness. 12. So thqt caRes do not languish in the system for techni\u00ad cal reasons, DCFS shbuld develop a case investigation procedure through which, under certain conditions, every ~ember.of the im: mediate family need not be physically seen and 1.nterv1.ewed. Th1.S should not become a routine process, however; it should require, at the very least, that' certain conditions be met and that super\u00ad visor approval be secured specifically in each case. 13. While DCFS' campaign to publici~e the state-wide hotline for child abuse reporting has increased public awareness of the problem of abuse and neglect, DCFS should ~lso publici~e some of the major indicators of abuse and neglect 1.n order to 1.ncrease the detection of victimized children. -451-\u00ab144 + ... c 14. All schools that train professionals who under the law are or will become mandated reporters should teach' as part of their normal curricula the !3igns of abuse as well as the techniques ,Of interviewing child victims of abuse, sexual assault, and negle~t. 15. Social service staff and all other mandated'teporters should receive training in the detection and identification of child abuse and neglect. The responsibility for this training should be coord~nated by DCFS and include the individual profes\u00ad sionalsocieties and associations to which mandated reporters be\u00adlong. 16. All agencies employing mandated rep'orters such as police departments, hospitals, school districts and others, as well as all professional societies and associations whose members are man\u00ad dated reporters, should design and implement a continuing informa\u00ad tion campaign to remind their employees or members of the specific statutory requirement to report all reasonable suspicions of child abuse and neglect to DCFS. Included as part of the information campaign should be a reminder of the possible consequences for failure to report. 17. The State Board of Education should examine the area of child abuse and neglect prevention and determine whether classes in parenting and similarpkills should be mandatory and, if so, at what level. Individual school districts are encouraged to evalu\u00ad ate their programs, if any, that touch upon child abusE':i\"\"'ahd~heglect prevention and adopt additional or new programs as neeaed s/ If D. Funding l .Ii >/ It goes without saying that the members of thiS' Commi\"ssion are cognizant of the harsh realities of today's economy and, in part:i\u00ad cular, the budget problems that currently confront the State 0fi Illinois. It also goes without saying that if necessary improve\u00ad ments are to be made in the child protection framework established in this state, additional monies need to be expepded. In terms of specific Commission recommendations made in this. chapter, ,\\ the iin\u00ad plementa,tion of multidisciplinary child protection teams (te'gisla\u00ad tive Recommendation 1) and child abuse prevention centers and ser\u00ad vice programs (Legislative Recommendation 8) will entail the ex\u00adpenditure of additional monies. Therefore, even though revenue sources were not our main con\u00ad cern in this investigation; two points should be made: 1. Implementation of our recommendations should lead to long\u00ad term savings in that efforts currently expended in this area would become more coordinated. One of our major findings was thabl while the situation has improved somewhat, child protection servic~s still are duplicative and fragmented. At the least, the recommendations will eventually pay for themselves. -4521\"\" :-: ... > I ! ! I fl\u00b7, l /' 2. New sources of revenue are possible. State law,currlen~lY provides that additional fees to be imposed on marriage dISSO utlon petitions and marriage licenses (in the amount of $5 and $10, respec\u00adti '~hel ters (\"An Act in relation to domestic relations and domestIc vIolence shelters , and service programs,\" enacted by the 82nd Gen7ral Assembly). ThIS law .has been held unconstitutional, but only WJ.th respect to the divorce surcharge, in the Circuit Court of Cook Count~ ca~e of Crocker v. Horgan M. Finley, et al. (No. 82-CH-l), WhICh IS now on appeal in the Illinois Supreme Court. Clearly child abuse and neglect are do~estic problems and, as such are closely related to marriage and dIvorce. It seems rea\u00ad sonable, then, that these fees could be increased ,to cover t~e cost of fund\u00b1'ng the implementation of our child abuse :ecc;>mmendatJ ons: And even if the Illinois high court upholds the fI~dIng of,the CIr\u00ad cuit court that the domestic violence shelter fundIng law IS un-, constitutional, marriage license feeEj ~ou~d be :maffe<?ted and,stIll could be earmarked for costs incurred In ImprOVIng thIS state s child protection system. kh alternative or supplementary, source of funding might be , - , \"h k specifically designated refunds of income tax., That IS, a c ec - off\" on state income tax returns could be provIded that would al~ow taxpayers receiving a refund to voluntarily earmark a small portIon of it (such as $1, $2 or $3) for a children's trust fund. California Iowa Kansas, Michigan, Virginia, and Washington all recently im~lementedone of these funding strategies by enacting children's trust fund legislation. Implementation of these ~trate\u00ad gies would not only provide a practical solut~on to the, fundIng problem in a time of shrink~ng state s7r~i~es, but would enhance public awareness and communIty responsIb:!.lIty.

The' ad'dition established the statute of the State regarding child abuse and neglect, de\u00ad fined certain pertinent terms, set the framework for \"reporting, and encouraged the fostering of multi-discipline community and hespital-based teams ~1ithin each locality. \" \\') \"The local department sharI foster, when practi\u00ad cable, the creation, maintenance and coordination of hospital and cOlnmunity-based multidiscipline teams which shall include where pfP'~jlible, but not be limi ted to, members of the medical~}'n9,ntal health, social work, nursing, education, l\u20ac.gal'<;and law en\u00ad forcement, professions.

Almost immediately, a need arose for some standards and guide\u00ad lines to structure and give direction to the teams. Therefore, the Governor's Advisory Committee on Child Abuse and Neglect (also established by the aforementioned Code amendments) designated a subcommittee to perform such a\" function on behalf of the local teams. Meanwhile, Region III of the Department of Hea~th, ~ducation, and Welfare signed a contract with the consultl.~g fl.rm Develop\u00ad ment Associ.ates, Inc. ,. to provide assistance to State g:!:'oups as they began to structure programs for child abuse and neglect.

This comndttee should represent a cross-section community in demographic characteristics determined necessary by the Program Development Committee and may include representatives from civic groups, volunteer organizations, business and government. Members chosen for this committee should have skills, knowledge or influence necessary for contributing to program organization, coordination and evaluation as well as acquisition of fundi.ng. These members should also have demonstrated an interest and concern about child abuse and neglect in their community. C.

A team member's travel time should not exceed two hours a day . V. CITIZEN PARTICIPATION ON A COMMUNITY BASED TEAM A. . THE COMMUNITY BASED TEAM SHALL DEVELOP MECHANISMS FOR CITIZEN PARTICIPATION SO AS TO ASSURE AN ACCURATE VIEW U ' OF ARE~ NEEDS, PATTERNS, AND TOTAL CITIZEN S.UPPORT. The Community Based Team should eBcourage the participation of nonagency people. This will allow corr~erned citizens to share leadership and guidance in~the planning and development of programs.

Each organization repre~ented on the team may wish to assess i,ts interna.l service capa.bility, adminfstrative procedures, planning and funding resources and commitment to the team process before assun\\:Lngresponsibilities within the team's plan. BASED ON THE FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS OF Ti:IE STUDY, A PLAN SHALL BE DEVELOPED TO SUPPORT A COMMUNITY SYSTEM FOR THE PREVENTION, IDENTIFICATION AND TREATMENT OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT. . The plan should establish a framework for cooperative community structures to prevent and treat child abuse and neglect. \" \"'/ This plan should include: 1. measurable goals (long-term, intermediate and short-term) .. 2. priorities. 3. operational objectives. 4. specific action steps.

SHALL SET THE DIRECTION FOR \"SOCI1\\L ACTI~~ THROUGH THE DEVE:;LOPMENT OF PUBLIC POLICIES THAT STRENGTHEN FAMILY LIFE, IN ORDER TO ALLEVIATE THE ECO~9M:r'C AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROBLEM OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT. A thorough study must be undertaken before an effective plan can be developed. The study should consist of a compilation of relevant statistical information as well as <?pinion~ and the'/analysis of these to determi'ne problems. It 1S cruc1al that real needs based on facts be identified. The problems that appear J;Tlost obvious may be those for which a solution is already known and may not reflect the more critical \" problems underlying the service delivery system that should be addressed in the plan. The more directly each goal can be related to a specific part of the problem, the more successful planning efforts will be. It is d~fficult to develop realistic long-range goals because changes in condi tio.ns upon which they are based are not always predictable. It is important, however, that teams attempt long-range '!planning to set the over-all framework of their short-term goals and efforts. It ~s also essential that the team establish priorities among 1tS goals to reduce aonfusion about which activity is more important and to provide direction on where scarce resources can most effectively be used. In doing this, the team should always keep in mind the interdependence of various activities. Adaption of existiY{g resources as well as development of new ~esources should be considered. Existing day-care programs might, for example, reserve a \"number of slots for abused or negleq,tedchildren after securing training for program\u00b7 staff. Voluntary 9rganizations and church\u00b7 groups also sponsor programs that might be adapted to the needs of abusing and neglecting families. The plan \"should include a description of existing coordinating procedures, such as referrals, sharing of information, and ter:minating of cases, and should make recommendations for changes if needed. VII. CASE CONSULTATION COMMtTTEE A. ANY MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE OR HIS DESIGNEE MAY PRESENT A CASE TO THE CASE CONSULTATION COMMITTEE. THE LOCAL WELFARE AGENCY SHALL DETERMINE-WHICH OF ITS CASES ARE IN NEED OF THE COMMITTEE'S ASSISTANCE. THE LOCAL WELFARE AGENCY -495-11~ ----------- MUST BE ULTIMATELY RESPONSlBLE FOR DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING SERVICE ON ITS CASES. Appropriate cases to be brought, to the Case Consultation Committee should be situat;ions where the specific trsat\u00ad ment needs are not clear, where it is questionable whether the child can safely remain at home, where a permanent plan of foster care or adoption is to be considered, or where numerous community resources and treatment services must be coordinated. B. THE CASE CONSULTATION COMMITTEE SHALL ASSIST THE LOCAL WELFARE AGENCY IN MAKING A COMPREHENSIVE 'DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT Pk~ FOR EACH CASE PRESENTED TO THE COMMITTEE. THE COMMITTEE SHALL ASSIST IN MOBILIZING AND COORDINATING SERVICES TO MEET BOTH ShORT AND LONG TERM TREATMENT GOALS. C. The Case Co~sultation Committee shall assist by: 1. collecting relevant information on the child and family members to validate a complaint or report: to the greatest extent possible, information should be collected directly from the family. 2. providing a forum to integrate information and i,dentify potential problems in servic.e deli very. 3. assessing needs,. strengths and priority problems of the child and family members. 4. recommending short- and long-term treatment plans and matching needs with appropriate resources. 5. coordinating referrals to available resources. 6. promoting\" development.of needed resources. 7. \" determining when a case is to be presented for another review. 8. developing a recall system to assure that cases will be reviewed at predetermined intervals. 9. determining when a case can be safely terminated. THE CASE CONSULTATION COMr~ITTEE SHALL INSURE THAT APPROPRIATE FEEDBACK IS PROVIDED TO INDIVIDUALS WHO REPORT SUSPECTED CHILD ABUSE OR NEGLECT SITUATIONS, WHERE THIS IS ALLOWED BY LAW. -496-, , i I '. The ~tate Department of Welfare, Social Se~vice Manual out~~~es procedure~ for providing such feedB~ck. In add~t10n, the comm1ttee could determine other feedback m7thods: . e.g., a reporti,ng professional might attend d1agnost1c and/or treatment review conference. D. THE CASE CONSULTATION COMMI'rTEE SHALL ENCOURAGE COORDINATED EFFORTS AMONG AGENCIES AND INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE RENDERING ' DIRECT SERVrCES TO A FAMILY. WHEN SERIOUS PROBLEMS OF COORDINATION OR SERVICE DELIVERY OCCUR, THE CASE SHOULD BE REVIEWED ~Y THE COMMITTEE. Ini ~ial1y, se:~:'Vice providers would convene to clarify the1r respect1ve roles and set intervals for progress conferences. Each provider would accept responsibility for communicating with other providers whenever indicated e.g.', when a family crisis warrants concerted action. ' ~rovid7rs wil~ want to co~sider the advisability of 1nvol v1ng fam1ly members 1n conferences when appropriate. When a conflict between providers cannot be resolved it would be in the family's best interest for the ca~e to be reviewed by the Case Consultation Committee. VIII. PARENTS' AND CHILDREN'S RIGHTS A. THE CASE CONSULTATION COMMITTEE SHALL AT ALL TIMES REMAIN AWARE OF THE NEED TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF PARENTS AND CHILDREN IN THE PRESENTATION OF CASES BEFORE THE' COMMITTEE. All committee members shall become familiar with State legislation: and agency regulations regarding confidentiality in child abuse and neglect cases. Minimally, the Case Consultation Committee shall adhere to the Privacy Protection Act of 1976, Section 2.1-377 through 2.1-386 of the Code of Virginia. 'Any information shared concer;'ing the child and his/her family shall safeguard to the greatest extent possible, the Privacy rights of the individual involved. ' B.
