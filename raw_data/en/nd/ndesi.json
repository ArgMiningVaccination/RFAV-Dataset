Program Details Program Format Orientation Residential orientation will take place Sunday evening and be hosted by our housing staff. All program orientations will begin on the Monday of the program start. During this required orientation, we will review the overall program schedule, discuss policies and safety, and answer questions. Staff will be on-hand to address any issues. Check-in for residential students is on Sunday preceding program start - please see the 'Residential Student' dropdown for more information. Program Format The morning block of time in the program (9:00am-3:00pm ET each day) will be mentored research with the student's home laboratory. During this time, students will be introduced to and participate in research happening in the lab and will be fully integrated into the research team with activities including team meetings and presentations - an incredible opportunity to interact with world-class researchers. Mentors will guide students in understanding the ongoing scientific inquiry and will work with the students on interpreting journal articles related to that research. Throughout the program, students will work with their mentors and PIs to build their research skills and interpret and extrapolate on real experimental data. Where possible, each student will be able to complete a research project they design with their mentor. All of this learning will culminate in the student producing a poster about their lab's research to be presented at the program's virtual poster session at the end of each term. In the afternoons, students will participate in a variety of activities to supplement and prepare them for their mentored research: - Journal Clubs: begin to distill critical information from previously published scientific research through weekly meetings led by a program Classroom Assistant (CA). Journal clubs are designed to prepare students to interpret data and published scientific research, including being able to answer the following types of questions: - Problem - what is the problem? why is this needed? - Significance - why do we/public care? - Approach - what technique(s) did they use? - Results - what were their major conclusions? - Analysis - what did you think about the results, techniques etc.? do you find them reliable? - Figure Interpretation - what was the best figure that helped you come to this conclusion? - Library Seminars: learn the practical skills necessary for conducting database research, illustrating data, poster design tips and tricks ... and more! Students may also use this time to conduct database research on their own and begin working on their research posters. - Guest Presentations: hear from Tufts faculty, post-doctoral scholars, and senior members of Tufts' administration about their research, career path, experience in the field of research and their current research. Plenty of time will be allowed for Q&A. - Networking Sessions: students will have the opportunity to informally discuss their ongoing research with their peers and program CAs. Poster Session & Closing Ceremony One of the highlights of our program is the opportunity for each student to develop a poster on a research question being investigated in their lab. The student's mentor will help them develop this poster, a critical skill for any researcher. At the end of each term, all of our students will display their posters at a Poster Session with the opportunity to explain their research and answer the questions of their peers, researchers, and scientists from across the University. Parents and/or guardians will be invited to attend the Closing Ceremony. The Ceremony will occur on the last day of the program, and will conclude by 2pm. Exact details and invitations will be forthcoming. Sample Schedule Please note: The below represents a sample schedule based on our best expectations for the in-person iteration of this program. The schedule is subject to change as we continue to develop the program to be as meaningful as possible for our students. The Tufts Summer Research Experience will conclude by 2pm on 8/11/2023 with a Final Research Symposium for students, parents, guardians, and participating lab personnel.
