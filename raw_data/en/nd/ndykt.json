Acupuncture is an ancient alternative treatment that is based on traditional Chinese medicine. By administering thin needles into specific points on the body or face, our clinicians can treat many health concerns that may not respond well to conventional treatments alone. Acupuncture, chiropractic care, alternative therapies and even the traditional medicine our Florence, SC, team offers can relieve your symptoms. Here's what you should know about acupuncture. Acupuncture Stimulates the Nervous System Acupuncture is believed to control and improve the nervous system, which can help alleviate many symptoms resulting from stress. By stimulating the central nervous system, this ancient medicine treatment can stimulate the body's natural healing processes to improve your physical, mental and emotional health. While it might sound like it, acupuncture is not a spiritual practice. It is a practice deeply rooted in ancient Chinese medicine. No, It Doesn't Hurt This is one of the top questions we get from individuals who are curious about acupuncture but haven't taken the plunge. The needles we use are not the same used to administer vaccines or take blood. These needles are pin-like, which means that when our team places them into the skin, you shouldn't feel anything more than slight pressure. In fact, most people say that acupuncture is a relaxing experience. You May Need Several Sessions Acupuncture can relieve many symptoms, from pain to nausea due to chemotherapy; however, it often takes multiple sessions to see the desired effect. Of course, this will depend on the type and severity of the condition you are dealing with. Our team will review your medical history and understand your condition during your consultation before determining how many sessions you'll require. Acupuncture Can Treat Various Health Problems While pain relief is one of the top reasons people turn to us for acupuncture, many conditions and problems can also be treated with acupuncture. These conditions include digestive issues, insomnia, anxiety and menstrual and fertility issues. If you're wondering if you could benefit from acupuncture, all you have to do is give us a call.
