Patch was not immediately able to reach Mazi for comment. According to court documents, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General \u2014 HHS-OIG \u2014 received a complaint in April 2021 from a member of the public that Mazi was offering homeoprophylaxis immunization pellets which she claimed would provide lifelong protection from COVID-19. Mazi also provided fake CDC COVID-19 vaccination record cards with instructions on how to complete the cards to make them falsely appear to be records of the FDA-authorized Moderna vaccine. The investigation revealed that Mazi provided fake CDC COVID-19 vaccination cards for more than 200 individuals. According to court documents, Mazi also offered homeoprophylaxis immunization pellets in place of childhood vaccinations required for attendance at school. Mazi provided her patients with deceptive \"immunization\" cards which she knew would be submitted to schools, and which fraudulently indicated that authorized vaccines had been administered. The investigation revealed that Mazi provided these fake immunization cards to more than 100 people. \"The defendant spread inaccurate medical information about COVID-19 for personal gain, clearly taking advantage of a situation that had made our community vulnerable,\" said FBI Acting Special Agent in Charge Tim Stone. \"As the government worked to provide accurate and relevant information during the pandemic, Mazi took advantage of the situation and chose to line her own pockets with profits from fraudulent vaccine documents and medicine, abusing the trust placed in her as a medical professional. The FBI will not tolerate such an abuse of trust.\" Mazi is scheduled to be sentenced July 29 in San Francisco. She faces a maximum statutory prison sentence of 20 years for the wire fraud charge and five years for the false statements charge. In addition, each charge carries a maximum $250,000 fine and 3 years of supervised release. Get more local news delivered straight to your inbox. [Sign up for free "}
