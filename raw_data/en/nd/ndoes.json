Open Access OBM Hepatology and Gastroenterology Case Report Successful Treatment of a Pregnant Woman with Chronic Active Hepatitis B using Accepted: July 25, 2017 Published: July 2 8, 2017 Abstract Background : Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection during pregnancy occasionally raises several issues such as acute exacerbation and the potential for vertical mother -to- child transmission. Case report: Here, we present the case of a female patient with chronic HBV infection who was treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and had a normal pregnancy and delivery. Furthermore, the use of TDF, HBV vaccination and pass ive immunization of her child with hyperimmune hepatitis B immunoglobulin successfully prevented vertical transmission Conclusions : During pregnancy, women with chronic active HBV infections may require additional care and interventions, such as the administration of TDF after the birth remain unsolved. Keywords Acute exacerbation ; HBV ; pregnancy ; tenofovir disoproxil Introduction Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major health concern worldwide , with the highest rates in Africa and Asia. HBV is a leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and end -stage liver disease [1]. Although HBV vaccination is available worldwide, HBV can infect humans through vertical transmission and affects females of childbearing ag e [1]. Although detection of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) indicates active HBV replication, HBeAg -positive patients have been reported to be younger than HBeAg -negative patients [2]. Clearly, it is important to prevent vertical HBV transmission from mother- to-child at de well as PEGylated interferon (PEG -INF) are effective treatments for chronic HBV infection [1, 4]. However, during pregnancy, safety has not been established for the use of PEG -INF and NUCs other than both HBV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [1]. TDF is classified as a category B medication (no risk in animal studies, but unknown risk in humans) by the United States Food and Drug Administration [1] . In Japan, TDF has been available since 2014 [5]. We here present the case of a 37- year -old HBeAg -positive female patient with a chronic HBV genotype C infection who was treated with TDF and had a normal pregnancy and delivery. Furthermore, the use of TDF, HBV vaccination and passive immunization of her child with hyperimmune hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) successfully prevented vertical transmission of HBV to her child. Ethics statement Our institution does not require ethical approval for reporting individual cases or case series. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of her information in this article . Case report In September 2014, a 37- year -old woman with chronic hepatitis B who was planning to start a family was referred to our department. The patient had no other relevant medical history, did not drink alcohol and had no drug allergies. Both her mother and broth er were HBV carriers. Her height and body weight were 1.78 m and 60 kg, respectively, and her laboratory findings are shown in Table 1. The patient had a long history of treatment with antivirals for chronic hepatitis B.In June 2003, she was diagnosed with HBeAg -positive hepatitis with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels of 160 alanine transaminase (ALT) levels of 244 IU/L and HBV DNA > 7.6 log10 copies/mL. The patient was found to be infected with HBV genotype C. In August 2003, a sh owed chronic hepatitis (F1/A2) type B, and she was started on 100 mg of lamivudine (LAM) daily for acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B, with AST levels of 1,139 IU/L, ALT levels of 1,040 IU/L and HBV DNA 7.2 log10 copies/mL. In November 2006, viral b reakthrough occurred, and in December 2008 she was started on 10 mg of adefovir (ADF) daily. In June 2009, LAM and ADF were stopped and the patient received natural interferon- (6 MIU, three times per week) for 6 months. In June 2010, she was started on LAM plus ADF again because of elevated transaminase levels. In July 2013, transient elastography revealed a value of 4.8 kPa, indicating no cirrhosis. In March 2014, she started entecavir (ETV) plus ADF. No drug resistance mutations of HBV DNA polymerase we re detected by level was 2.4 log10 copies/mL.

In September 2014, after expressing her desire to conceive and after informed c onsent was obtained, her treatment regimen was changed to 300 mg of TDF daily. In January 2015, she became pregnant (Table 2). Abdominal ultrasonography showed chronic liver disease with mild fatty changes. In October 2015, she gave birth to a healthy girl who tested hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative. The patient's liver function remained within the normal range at OBM and Gastroenterology 2017 ; 1(3), doi:10.21926/obm.hg.170 3004 delivery (Table 3). The use of an HBV vaccine and passive immunization of her child with hyperimmune hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg ) prevented vertical transmission of HBV.

In June 2017, her laboratory results were as follows: AST, 18 IU/L; ALT, 10 IU/L; and HBV DNA was not detected. Although she was advised to abstain from breastfeeding while using TDF, her daughter was hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) -positive and showed no evidence of liver disease. Discussion Before her pregnancy, the woman in the present case had a long history of treatment for chronic hepatitis B infection, including NUCs or interferon- for 12 years. We selected TDF to treat the patient because she experienced acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B and viral breakthrough during trea tment with LAM. A previous report [7] showed significant benefits of the use of NUCs to rapidly reduce of viral DNA for the treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B. In the present case, we were unsuccessful in our attempt to discontinue NUCs by replacement with interferon- seq uential therapy [4]; therefore, NUCs were not stopped before her pregnancy. TDF use has been shown to be safe for women and their infants during pregnancy [3, 8, 9]. We recommended that breastfeeding should be avoided during her treatment with TDF based on the TDF label information. The incidence of TDF -associated renal dysfunction in Japanese HIV -infected patients is high [10] and low body weight has been identified as an independent risk factor for TDF-associated renal dysfunction [10]. It has recently be en reported that tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) has the potential to be as effective as TDF, but with greater safety [11]; however, further studies are required to determine the safety of TAF during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Consequently, TDF plays a centr al role in the treatment of HBV infection during pregnancy. Antiviral therapy improves HBV DNA suppression and reduces mother -to-child transmission in women with chronic HBV infection and high viral loads compared to HBIg therapy and HBV vaccination alone [12]. Furthermore, during the third trimester in mothers with high HBV DNA levels, the rate of mother -to-child transmission has been reported to be lower in patients undergoing TDF therapy than among those who receive standard care without antiviral therap y [3, 13]. Conclusions Women with chronic HBV infection require additional care and monitoring during pregnancy. We report the case of a chronic HBV infected- patient treated with TDF who had a normal pregnancy and delivery. Careful attention and follow- up are necessary during the use of TDF for HBV i nfection in pregnancy as the remote effects of TDF after the birth remain unsolved.
