Was there even a shred of scientific truth to this belief? As a Malaysian, I'm surprised that Malaysia is one of the top countries whose people believe vaccines cause autism (Figure 1). Perhaps we are just not as vocal in voicing this issue, giving the illusion that vaccine hesitancy isn't prevalent here. The Ipsos Mori Perils of Perception Survey conducted 29,133 interviews across 38 countries in 2017. They [revealed that](https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2018-02/ipsos-mori-perils-of-perception-2017-charts_0.pdf) 8-44% of people believed vaccines caused autism in children, 23-63% were unsure, and only 20-62% did not believe it. If you average them, nearly 6 in 10 people worldwide were unsure or believed that vaccines cause autism (Figure 1). No wonder the World Health Organization (WHO) named vaccine hesitancy as [one of the](https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/ten-threats-to-global-health-in-2019) top 10 threats to public health in 2019. Why do people still believe that vaccines cause autism? As a science graduate, I was under the impression that this belief has been widely debunked. But I didn't read into the details, and perhaps there might be a reason for this belief to sustain to this day. A backdrop on autism Autism spectrum disorder (autism) is a life-long [neurodevelopmental condition](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/autism-spectrum-disorder) that occurs in childhood due to certain brain changes. It [affects](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/autism-spectrum-disorders) [1-2%](https://www.autismspeaks.org/autism-statistics-asd) of children worldwide, [about 4-times](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4164392/) more often in boys than girls, likely due to how different sex hormones affect brain development. The [main symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/facts.html) are impaired social communication and restricted, repetitive behaviors, which are problematic enough to impair daily activities. People with autism may also face delayed developmental skills in language, movement, cognition, and behavioral and emotional control. Only with the publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, third edition (DSM-III), in the early 1980s, was autism [professionally defined](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3757918/). Before that, autism was [thought of](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5789217/) as childhood schizophrenia, mental retardation, or mere bizarre behaviors. "}
