As Conventional Lending Tightens The Answer May Lie In Simple Stock Loans For many individuals and businesses who own securities. stock loans are becoming a quick and easy source of financing. Stock Loans are extremely attractive because they are non-recourse, fast and easy, and rely only on the value of the stock; not on credit scores-stocks are the collateral. Any public stock index in the world as well as open-ended mutual funds can be used as collateral. The only criteria is that the stock is publicly listed and has volume to qualify. Non-Recourse . Borrowers enjoy the up side of ownership without the down side of loss. Their position is leveraged by borrowing against it. There is no call provision . If their stock sinks below what is borrowed , if they choose to, they can simply walk away. The transaction is NON-RECOURSE; no liability whatsoever. Favorable Rates. Depending on the quality of the stock, borrowers enjoy unheard of low rates of 3%-5%. Funds For Many Purposes. Businesses and individual s are using stock loans for such pur\u00ad poses as to grow their business, increase cash reserves, create liquidity, send their kids to college or just to make it through these tough times with a cash reserve. Fast Easy Approval. The loan process is simple, fast and easy because the only factor considered is the quality of the stock. If the stock is free trading and has sufficient volume, quotes are generated in 4 business hours. Although lending against securities is not a new concept, Simple Stock Loans are becoming increasingly popular due to the reality of today's economy Stocks are used as collateral. Stock loans are available form $50,000 to $200 million for start-up and established businesses that need to increase capital and individuals including corporate CEOs, brokers and mutual fund managers who want to diversify holdings or for any reason except to buy stocks. The Stock Loan Quote Request asks IS easy questions and focuses on determining stock quality, quantity and volume and ensuring that the stock is not restricted or in a 40 I k. Fast Funding. A stock loan is usually funded in 5 days or less as opposed to a loan that banks or other financial institutions might take several weeks to understand and commit to. Many borrowers don't have time to wait the 30 to 45 days that traditional lending requires. Often, even borrowers with strong banking relationships are denied or are now required to submit mountains of paperwork and documentat ion that had been unheard of in recent years.

We still intend to keep the B Street Pier as the primary facility,\" Vandergaw said. Work on the new terminal at the foot of Broadway began last month with erecting steel frames for the 52,000-square-foot terminal building. Jaynes Corp. of Califor\u00ad nia is working on the project. That work should be finished in February , and the entire building is-expected to be completed by October and occupied by port and U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials by year end. The $28 million project was undertaken to provide alternative berthing space for visiting cruise ships while the port begins work on a long-planned refurbishment of the current cruise ship terminal at the B Street Pier. Not everyone was thrilled with the development. A legal challenge against the port filed by the San Diego Navy Broadway Complex Coalition , an ad hoc group opposed to a much larger hotel/of\u00ad fice development at Lane Field last year alleges that the port violated the state's Coastal Act and the port's own master plan by not including an oval park plaza in the Broadway project's design. The port denied the allegations , and says the pier cannot accommodate the plaza. On ,.

The San Diego company makes an en\u00ad ergy storage device called an ultracapacitor that may have an infinite life span, says its top promote rs. \"You can charge and discharge an ultra\u00ad capacitor billions of times, and it doesn't run out,\" said David Schramm, Maxwell 's chief executive. \"If you don't abuse it, it can theoretically last forever.\" The device that comes in many cell sizes and shapes has been around for many years, but it's been only in recent years Financing Woes Delay Stem Cell Lab ~Construction By HEATHER CHAMBERS A taxpayer-funded stem cell research laboratory planned for the Torrey Pines Mesa is among three such facilities in the works statewide that have hit snags in their construction timelines. A move-in date originally scheduled for December has been delayed until June 2011 for the Sanford Consortium for Re\u00ad generative Medicine , a group comprised of the Burnham Institute for Medical Research, the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, The Scripps Research Institute and UC San Diego. Louis Coffman , vice president of the consortium , said raising money on the capital markets has proven difficult in the current economic environment. \"We've got all the philanthropy we've sought to raise,\" he said. \"Right now our focus is in the state bonds to fund the debt portion.\" Ultimately , the consortium aims to raise $62 million through the sale of tax -exempt bonds to finance the building's construc\u00ad tion, which has risen in price from $100 million to $127 million, not including the $15 million cost of land. \"Our goal is to get the building off of the ground ,~' Coffman said. \"Afterwards we can always pay down the debt.\" In 2008, the consortium was awarded a .. Stem Cell page 10 that the gizmos have been incorporated into wider commercial uses such as wind\u00ad mills, hybrid buses and trucks, electric rail vehicles and factory machinery . Ultracapacitors are energy storage devices that release all their power in a sudden burst, as opposed to a battery that takes much longer to deliver the same power. The downside is the devices don't store the power very long, as batteries do. The capacitors also don't generate energy as batteries do, through internal chemical reactions ; they only store and release it. Demand Grows But it's that ability to deliver massive power surges and perform the same over and over 'again, and in extreme tempera\u00ad tares where regular batteries fail, that is creating high~r detnand f9r the products . Maxwell said Jan. 13 that it delivered its 1 millionth large cell ultracapacitor in December , dear evidence that the prod\u00ad uct is gaining ground, and swamping its competitors. \"We'Fe so far ahead of them (Maxwell 's four major competitors) , it's not even close,\" said Schramm , whose company 's main competitor is Japan's Panasonic Corp.

With its global corporate headquarters in the Netherlands, Optelec is a distributor, designer and manufacturer of technologies for people with eyesight problems. A major player in the business, Optelec has about 65 percent of the global market, said Andre Hardy, president of Optelec US, which was founded in 1985. Within the U.S., it has between 35 percent and 40 percent of the market, he added. The company's Vista office has about 35 employees. Hardy said the U.S. company did between $18 million and $19 million in business in 2009. There was an increase in revenue of about $2 million from 2008. Last year was the best in the company's history, he said. Hardy, a former NFL running back, has transferred his passion for sports to help\u00ad ing the visually impaired remain active. \"I have owned and operated lots of businesses , he said. \"I've worked in real estate, but nothing that excited me like The this industry.\" Optelec's many products range from enhanced computer screens to portable reading devices that people can use at home or in the workplace. Some hand-held electronic devices can be used to magnify objects on a desktop or from a distance. All of the magnifiers feature multiple color contrasts, such as a yellow font on a blue background , to make reading easier. Growing Need There is a growing need for the products of companies like Optelec. The recession has hit older workers especially hard. A 2008 AARP survey found 27 percent of workers age 45 and older reported that they had placed retirement on hold because of the economic downturn. We are likely to see an increasing number of workers who are coping with disabilities, such as loss of vision, as the baby boomers reach their golden years. They represent the demographic bulge that occur-red fol-\u00b7 lowing World War II. \u00b7 Products that help aging Americans see better and remain employed \"are really go\u00ad ing to be important for people who want to do their own businesses or part-time jobs, in addition to people in a traditional work environment,\" said Liliane Choney, execu\u00ad tive director of Revisions Resources, a non\u00ad profit organization based in San Diego that helps older adults remain independent.

They also offer a variety of home, auto, and commer\u00ad cial loans, Visa credit cards, and individual retirement accounts. As a proactive community participant, SDCCU supports a number of organizations that hold many of the same values and principles. .

As this financial leader grew, it began a long-term relationship with Cox Business in San Diego, taking advantage of its full spectrum of business communications . Cox Business, a division of Cox Communications , Inc., was perfectly poised to team up with SDCCU and help upgrade their communication infrastructure . Trusted Provider Irene Oberbauer, President & CEO of SDCCU, says that Cox Business has become her credit union's trusted communication and Internet service provider. \"It started with how hard Cox worked to accurately evaluate the state of our communications to ensure that we'd get what we needed;' Oberbauer says. \"And them:' Oberbauer says !hat this attention to her company's needs exemplified the value of working with Cox Business. \"San Diego County Credit Union is San Diego's largest locally based financial institution and we serve over two hundred thousand happy customers .

They can't read documents.\" More than 16 million Americans report some form of visual impairment , even when wearing glasses or contacts, accord\u00ad ing to Optelec. That number is expected to double by 2030. Hardy said one thing that sets his company apart from competitors is the desire to partner with others to find solutions to vision problems. The company has formed a partnership with the Foun\u00ad dation Figp.ting Blindness ~to conduct a meet our growing business D!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! needs:' \"You know, it's personal for me. I'm a Cox customer [at home) and I have had nothing but the best relationship with Cox Communications -with [their] bundling packages, etc.;\u00b7 she says. Cox Business professionals examined SDCCU's data needs and recommended a four-part installation. First was a powerful \"T LAN;' or transpar\u00ad ent local area network. Next came new, upgraded phone lines using Cox Digital Phone service. This service doesn't use any proprietary \"gadgets; which means SDCCU can keep their existing phone system hardware and even their phone numbers. Along with the phone lines came a new PRI, or primary rate interface, which carries multiple voice and data transm1ss1ons public-awareness campaign. Cross-Country Tour The major initiative in 2010 will be the Optelec VisionZONE , a cross-country tour that will travel to 18 cities to discuss health and increase awareness of vision problems. VisionZONE events will take place during the foundation 's fundrais\u00ad ing initiative, Vision Walk. VisionZONE events will feature a variety of product demonstrations and exhibits from Optelec, its online company, ShopLowVision.com, and other corporate partners. The VisionZONE events will allow participants in the fundraising walks to experience a variety of activities related to low vision, including navigating through an obstacle course wearing sight-reducing goggles. Hardy said the events will educate the public about ways to help people with failing eyesight. Too often, people with vi\u00ad sion problems, such as macular degenera\u00ad tion, are told there is no help for them, he explained. The disease results in a loss of vision in the center of the visual field. \"There is a giant gap between diagnosis and awareness of solutions,\" Hardy said. \"Typically, someone will go and see their doctor and they will say, 'There is nothing we can do for you.' The truth is there isn't a lot they can do for your retina because it is a degenerative disease, but we make products that allow people to function, even with macular degeneration .\" Emmet Pierce is a freelance writer for the Business Journal.

The Extra Mile \"I couldn't believe Cox Business went as far as they did;' Oberbauer says. \"We needed to have the new cable go from point A to point B, across Mira Mesa Boulevard, which is a major thoroughfare. They had to literally shut down the street in the middle of the night, brave as they were, and there was no disruption to our service. Cox Business did that of course to accommodate us, because we didn't want to have to shut down service during the day for our customers. It was phenomenal that they were very successful in making it happen with no disruption whatsoever: ' \"There were a lot of people at Cox Business who helped establish this relationship , including a number of the executive staff;' she says. \"I know the top-notch service that we get through Cox Business, and it's second to none. They're a lot like us-we make service number one with our customers; they definitely make service number one with theirs:\u00b7 Oberbauer says that as SDCCU continues to grow-not just in the San Diego market-the company knows there will be other opportuni\u00ad ties to do many other things with Cox Business. \"There is so much technology opportunity that Cox has to offer;' she says,\"we're looking forward to sampling additional products so we can continue our relationship with Cox Business.

Score San FINANCE Diego and Borrego Mike Allen Springs Bank, N.A. is helping fledgling en\u00ad trepreneurs find the financing they need. The two nonprofit organizations joined f0rces with Borrego Springs in the last several years, working with business owners through the pre-loan process, including developing business plans, figuring their financial projections, and assisting with the application. With the assistance, applications for SEA-guaranteed loans through the Com\u00ad munity Express Loan Program have a bet\u00ad ter chance of getting approved, says Paul Hollenbach, who has been volunteering his time with Score, aka the Service Corps of Retired Executives, for about 13 years. \"The Score volunteers are usually former businesspeople who have a lot of experience, and are familiar with some of the pitfalls, and can keep people from making the same mistakes that we made,\" Hollenbach said. Meanwhile, folks at CDC work as inter\u00ad mediaries with banks and delve more into the financial aspects of the business plans to get applications qualified and, ultimate\u00ad ly, funded by Borrego Springs Bank. Hollenbach and the CDC's Susan Lamping were recently given a special achievement award from the U.S. Small Business Administration for their suc\u00ad cessful track record in helping to qualify 70 businesses for SBA loans for the 2009 fiscal year, which ended in September. \"During this economic downturn, Susan and Paul have jointly developed an effective system to counsel and pre\u00ad qualify small-business loan applicants seeking Community Express loans,\" said Tony Vigil, SBA San Diego's deputy director. The businesses getting the loans ranged from landscapers to contractors, and even included a few new restaurants , Hollenbach says. About half the loans arranged through the CDC/Score/BSB program were tor startups and ranged from $15,000 to $50,000, with interest rates set at prime plus 3.75 percent to 4.75 percent. Last week, the rate equaled 7 percent to 8 percent, not bad for a new business, and the credits don't carry pre\u00ad payment penalties. First Business Bank Gets More TARP Money: Carmel Valley-based First Busi\u00ad ness Bank, which terminated an agree\u00ad ment last year to acquire 1st Pacific Bank of California , became the first lender in the region to receive a second invest\u00ad ment of federal dollars through the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program. FBB received $2 million in December on top of the $2.2 nllllion it got in April. Other local banks that have received TARP money are Zions Bancorporation (owner of California Bank & Trust and a !host of other banks)., which got $1.4 billion; Western Alliance Bancorpora\u00ad tion (owner of Torrey Pines other Pacific Trust Bank,.$19.3 million; Regents Bank, $12.7 million; Business Bank, 5.8 and Seacoast Commerce Bank $1.8 million. Capital Bancorp's Apjplication Still Pending: Capital Bancorp Limited the Lansing, Mich., holding company that owns majority stakes in three San Diego County banks, says its application to consolidate its San Diego banks has been pending since October. \"It's supposed to be approved some\u00ad time this year,\" said spokeswoman Angela Kimber. The planned merger of the Bank of Escondido , Point Lorna Community Bank and Sunrise Bank of San Diego was re\u00ad ported by the San Diego Business Journal in October. The applications were filed with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the state Department of Financial Institutions that month, Kimber says. All totaled, the three local banks have about $265 million in assets and four offices. Send any news regarding locally based financial institutions to Mike Allen via e-mail at mallen@sdbj. com. Knobbe Martens Moving Closer to Clients, Away From Courthouse Knobbe Martens Olson & Bear LLP, downtown San Diego's longtime occupant at 550 W C St., says it will relo\u00ad cate its headquarters to Del Mar Heights LAW this summer. Heather Chambers The Irvine-based intellectual property law firm has signed a 10-year lease to rent space previously occupied by Neuro\u00ad crine Biosciences Inc. Financial terms of the lease were not disclosed. ''\"We'll be farther from the courthouse but closer to our clients,\" said Managing Partner Ned Israelsen. The firm, which handles the bulk of San Diego's biotech patent applications , also plans on expanding its staff. \"Shortly after we move in we'll be up around 65 professionals, but we expect to grow to around 100 in the space,\" Israelsen said. Despite a recession that has taken a toll on legal work, Israelsen said the firm is seeing \"modest growth\" in biotech legal work and \"healthy growth\" in the high-tech industry. \"With the number of attorneys that we have and the good technical back\u00ad grounds that match the local high-tech and biotech base, we've been very suc\u00ad cessful in growing even during the reces\u00ad sion,\" he said. The firm plans to move into its new space in August. The K.no bbe Martens nameplate will replace Neurocrine's on the building. The biotech has struggled to gain its footing ever since Pfizer Inc. pulled out of a deal in 2006 to develop a sleeping pill. The company slashed half its work force in May, leaving it with ex\u00ad tra space. The biotech amended its lease agreement in October to save $27 million. Israelsen said Neurocrine had been seeking space for about a year before set\u00ad . tling on the location, across from the Del Mar Highlands Town Center at 12790 El Camino Real. \"Historica lly, it's been 40 to 50 percent more (costly) than downtown space,\" Israelsen said about the Del Mar Heights area. \"That gap has dropped dramati\u00ad cally with the current market.\" Mintz Levin Attorney Works On International Deal: San Diego-based attorney Jeremy Glaser, who practices corporate law at Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo P.C., recently represented contract research organization BioDuro LLC in its acquisition by Phar\u00ad maceutical Product Development Inc. .North Carolina-based PPD said it paid approximately $77 million in cash to acquire BioDuro . BioDuro, a San Diego-based company that manages a team of more than 550 scientists in Beijing, contracts with nine of the world's top 12 pharmaceutical firms. PPD saw opportunity to expand its contract services in China. Once the ac\u00ad quisition is complete, the firm will employ almost 1,000 people in China, making it the largest CRO in the country to offer both early stage discovery services and late stage clinical development support. \"We were pleased to represent Bio\u00ad Duro and their world-class team of researchers and scientists in this signifi\u00ad cant, international transaction,\" Glaser said. Besides the legal support, New York\u00ad based Peter J. Solomon Co. served as the exclusive investment banking adviser to BioDuro in the transaction. A First For USD: The University of San Diego School of Law has released what it says is the nation's first student\u00ad run climate and energy law journal. The San Diego Journal of Climate & Energy Law, which serves as a place for emerging legal issues related to climate change and energy, delves into topics such as insurance claims, law and economics associated with cap-and-trade greenhouse gas markets, and new energy policy. \"Climate and energy law issue~ are not only a focal point of public debate, but also of central interest to many of our students,\" said USD School of Law Dean Kevin Cole. The second annual Climate & Energy Law Symposium is scheduled to take place on USD's campus April 9. The event, which will explore regulatory ap\u00ad proaches being proposed and adopted to re.duce greenhouse gas emissions , is co-sponsored by the Energy Policy Initiatives Center, a nonprofit academic and research center of the USD School of Law, and the San Diego Journal of Climate & Energy Law.

SOIITHERN CAUFORNIA SAN DIEGO BUSINESS JOURNAL January 25, 2010 REAL ESTATE ROUNDUP School District Makes Strides on Multimillion-Dollar Upgrades Grossmont Union High School District is making progress toward the moderniza\u00ad tion of schools in its district with funding provided by Propositions H and U. Proposition H, a $247 million program, was approved by 62 percent of voters in March 2004 to fund repairs of aging schools in the district as well as the construction of a new school. Proposition U is a $417 million general obligation bond measure passed by voters in November 2008. Last year, under Proposition H, 264 class\u00ad room modernization projects were complet\u00ad ed at various campuses as part of Phase 2B of the program. The work included major bathroom renovations; new roofing, ceil\u00ad ings, walls and paint; removal/abatement of hazardous materials; cabinetry and whiteboards; and new digital projectors , clocks and intercoms. With the final Phase 2B project slated to be completed early this year, about half of the classrooms in existing schools will have been improved to the new district standards. In addition, Phase 3A of the program began in 2009 to include the construction of eight new science classroom buildings on campuses throughout the district. The first new science building to be completed will open next month at El Cajon Valley High School. The remaining science build\u00ad ings, with the exception of Granite Hills High School, will open by April 2010, with the final building scheduled to be completed in September. Progress has also been made to bring a new high school to the Alpine area. Site acquisition and preliminary design activi\u00ad ties are currently in progress. Stem Cell: *frompage3 $43 million facilities grant from the state stem cell agency to build a four-story research laboratory along North Torrey Pines Road where scientists from a vari\u00ad ety of disciplines could work side by side. San Diego-ba sed Lankford & Associates Inc. was selected to develop the proposed 130,000-square-foot building on 7.5 acres across from Salk. Hefty Contribution South Dakota philanthropist T. Denny Sanford also stepped in with $30 million, and the consortium changed its name to reflect his gift. The majority of that, or $22 million, will go toward the building of the facility with the remainder used for operational costs, Coffman said. But organizers were still $90 million shy of the $163 million price tag to build and equip the facility and recruit faculty. Coffman said the institute applied last fall for federal economic stimulus funding but didn't succeed in finding much grant money there. Jeanne Loring, director of the Center for Regenerative Medicine at The Scripps Research Institute, applied for one of the grants. The competition, she said, involved 25,000 other applicants. Despite the challenges , Loring and oth\u00ad ers said they're encouraged by the progress the consortium has made to date. At one point, they said they doubted the project would get built. Photo courtesy of The Geldner Group The new 220,000-square-foot Health Services Graduate Student Housing complex at UC San Diego includes 226 student apartments. Nine-Story Housing Project Completed at UCSD Campus General contractor Webcor Builders with architects Valerio Dewalt and Train Associates have completed the new UC San Diego Health Services Graduate Stu\u00ad dent Housing complex. The nine-story, 220,000-square-foot building was finished four months ahead of the original schedule and includes 226 student apartments, support facilities, activity areas and a \"green roof.\" The facility is scheduled to receive LEED Silver certification for sustainabil\u00ad ity. Design features include high energy\u00ad efficiency, 21 percent lower than baseline; high water-efficiency , 40 percent to 50 per\u00ad cent reductions in cost; and architectural exposed concrete finishes for reduced cost and maintenance. -Katie Pirillo Obstacles To Overcome The consortium faced challenges early on, first from a group of glider pilots who challenged the building's location. They said the proposed site, on land owned by UCSD, would interfere with their land\u00ad ing path. Glider pilots use the unpaved airstrip intermitt ently throughout the year, although most activities , like hang gliding and paragliding , happen closer to the coast. A state historical preservation group also challenged the consortium 's efforts to build near the site, saying it would in\u00ad terfere with the historical integrity of the property, used to fly aircraft for military and personal use since the 1920s. But the challenge was ultimately over\u00ad ruled by agencies that approved the proj\u00ad ect, including the UC Board of Regents and the California Coastal Commission. Later, the state budget crisis threat\u00ad ened to withhold funding for individual projects, a crucial commitment for the Sanford Consortiun1 and others looking to issue bonds. \"We're disappointed it took so long, but we're really happy it's going through,\" Loring said. Sanford Consortium 's project is among 12 major stem cell facilities planned for the state using $270 million in taxpayer money issued through the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine. The $3 billion state stem cell agency was approved by voters in 2004. An independent review of the impact of the projects last year by The Analysis Group suggested they would create $100 million in tax revenues between 2008 and 2011.

The upgrade planned are a new gangway and loading bridge; an elevated pas enger bridge that connects the gang\u00ad way to the terminal building; interior improvements to an existing warehouse building\u00b7 an elevator and escalator sys\u00ad tem to the passenger bridge; and a new 25,000-quare-foot building to handle luggage checking. The project also entails tructural pier work. Developing architectura l and eng1-neering plan forth project i e timated to co t _.7 million. The above-deck work i e timated at $17.7 million and the tructural pier work i expected to co t about $10 million, according to the port. Why even do a rehab of B Street when a new terminal i being built at the Broad\u00ad way Pier? Vandergaw ays the maller Broadway Pier cannot handle the new, larger cruise hips that carry an average of 3,500 pas\u00ad sengers, only up to the smaller 2,600-pas\u00ad senger model . Tourist Dollars San Diego s cruise business was down a bit last year compared with where it was in 2008 but it's still generating plenty of touri t dollars. Folks generally stay a day or so before or after their cruises, which primarily head to Mexico but include repositioning cruises to Alaska in the summer. Last year, the port reported having 233 cruise ship calls that carried about 842,000 passengers. That's down from 2008, when 255 ships stopped here that carried about 921,000 passengers . According to a 2005 study, the local economy benefits to the tune of about $2 million for each cruise ship that begins and ends a trip in San Diego. The same study found the local industry supports about 2,700 jobs. Joe Terzi, CEO of the San Diego Con\u00ad vention & Visitors Bureau, says that while cruise ships aren't critical to the region's tourism industry, they are an important part of it. 'The (port) needs to do something to increase the capacity and ability to trans\u00ad act with multiple ships at the same time,\" Terzi said. The Health Business is HOT!

The products are also becoming more prevalent in solar panel sy terns where extreme heat and cold prevent the use of most batteries. Driving Ahead But its the current use in vehicles that gets Schramm really excited. Since 2002, Maxwell has been a supplier to ISE Corp., a Poway manufacturer of gasoline/electric hybrid drive systems. The ultracapacitors incorporated into these drive systems play a major role in the braking and accel\u00ad eration of large buses and trucks, storing greater amounts of electric power for the short burst until the vehicle shifts over to more even power from gasoline. Maxwell says its large Boostcap ultraca\u00ad pacitors are now in ISE hybrid drive sys\u00ad tems found in some 300 mass transit buses in this country. In April, it received an order for capacitors to be included in some 850 diesel electric hybrid buses in China. ' China is a big user of hybrid transit and trucks, but our largest market is still in North America,\" said Carolyn Paynton, ISE's marketing director. Three of ISE's hybrid drive systems are being tested by the New York City Sanitation Department for possible use for its fleet. \"It's only a matter of time before all the buses in this country will be using some form of hybrid systems,\" she said. In the past three years, Maxwell's sales have been growing by double digits, with the sales of ultracapacitors propelling most of that growth. From about $57 million in 2007, Maxwell had $82 million in revenue ISAIA HUGO BOSS GIORGIO ARMAN I PAL ZILERI JEANS MORESCHI SHOES And Other Top Italian Designers MIS We Offer: Wardrobe Consultation Custom Clothing Fitting At The Store Or Your Home By Appointment ~ -1'n \u00a7!;db')(,(}-;?

Through the end of th third quart r, revenue wa 73 million, and will e ceed 100 million when the ompany report it year-end re ult next month, Schramm say . Of that, capacitor revenue went from $17 million in 2007 to about $40 million last year. Over three year from 2006 Ma \u00b7well has lost $16.5 million, $15.7 million, and $14.8 million. Through the end of Septem\u00ad ber, it reported a net loss of $13 million. Schramm says that should be remedied soon as Maxwell, founded in 1965, contin\u00ad ues to cut its costs and improve sales. On The Right Track Several stock analysts agree that Maxwell's stock, traded under MXWL on Nasdaq, should continue to rise this year. Dilip Warrier, with Thomas Weisel Partners LLC in San Francisco, stated in his November report that Maxwell had two consecutive quarters of positive cash flow, and was on track for the same in the fourth quarter. \"We believe the company remains on track to be profitable in 2010, and expect follow-on orders from current Chinese transit bus customers and orders from new customers could drive revenue upside in 2010, as could contracts from its micro electronics business,\" Warrier said. Shares of MXWL hit a 52-week low about a year ago at $4.50 but gradually rose to a high in October above $21 before falling a bit, and finishing the year near $18, for a 259 percent overall gain, making it among the biggest gainers of local public companies last year. Maxwell's total full-time employment is 316, with about two-thirds of that based in San Diego, and about 100 in Switzer\u00ad land. January 25, 2010 SAN DIEGO !BUSINESS JOURNAL www.sdbj.com IPa!Je 13 A SAN DIEGO BUSINESS JOURNAL SPECIAL REPORT - - COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE UPDATE Office Market Presents ,Opportunities for Upward Mobility REAL ESTATE: Declining Rents Encourage Tenants to Shop for Upgraded Space By EMMET PIERCE The current tenants' market for leased office space has created a game of musi\u00ad cal chairs among businesses in San Diego County. Firms routinely vacate their old space to take advantage of less expensive rent only to be replaced by other companies that also are looking to cut costs. The reces\u00ad sion and high unemployment have placed steady downward pressure on office lease and purchase costs. \"It is just tenants changing chairs right now,\" said David Marino, executive vice president at Irving Hughes Inc., a real estate company that represents tenants. \"Most companies are downsizing. The resulting effect is availability is up and it is not going down.\" Much of the activity is a result of downsizing or restructuring among exist\u00ad ing tenants, said Matt Carlson, a director with Cushman & Wakefield Inc. \"There are healthy companies out there that are taking advantage of historically low rents and some of the premier spaces that are out on the market,\" Carlson said. Many businesses are using today's low prices to move up to quality space, said Alan Nevin, director of economic research for MarketPointe Realty Advisors. \"Often they can get more space for less than what they were paying previously, \" he exp]ained. Nevin expects the bargain-hunting to continue into 2010, fueling a flurry of transactions. However , some analysts anticipate an end to the cycle because of rising prices in the year ahead. In order for that to happen, there must be job growth and a reduction in unemployment. For the present, the values of office properties have declined to the point where builders say it is difficult to rationalize new development. For most investors, it makes more sense to buy existing properties. \"There is really no new private devel\u00ad opment,\" said developer Dennis Cruzan, a principal of commercial real estate property company CruzaniMonroe. \"It is principally because of the financial mar\u00ad kets we are in and a lack of confidence in the economy. \" Many real. estate professionals still are reeling from the speed at which the mar\u00ad ket declined during the past two years, said Dan Ryan, a principal at Veralliance Properties Inc., an acquisition and devel\u00ad opment firm. \"Guys are in shell shock from how quickly the market has deteriorated,\" Ryan said. \"Perhaps 2010 will be the year when color returns to their faces.\" Moving Into New Space The recession has made it difficult to sell or lease new office space, but it's not impossible. Rich Simons, a partner in Sudbeyry Properties ]nc., said luck and hard work Stephen Whalen Alalil Nevin of MarketPointe Realty Advisors expects the chase for reduced-rate office space will continue this year.

The Terraces at Copley Point are located near the intersection of state Route 52 and Interstate 805. The buildings encompass 380,000 square feet. \"They took us 18 months to complete, \" Simons said. \"We had built it as a spec project. We leased one whole building to Cricket Communications/Leap Wireless. We manage the Cricket building.\" The other building, which encompasses 175,000 square feet, recently was sold to Kaiser Permanen te . \"I think it was location, design and tenacity,\" Simons said. \"Sometimes you get lucky.\" The Kaiser transaction represented a purchase at more than $300 per square foot, said Chris Hobson, a real estate bro\u00ad ker with Grubb & EllisiBRE Commercial San Diego. \"That was sign.ifican t.\" There have been other bright spots in the marketplace during the past two years, said Nevin. He noted that Bridgepoint Educa\u00ad tion Inc. took over hundreds of thousands of square feet in Sabre Springs and Kearny Mesa in 2009. Global defense and security firm BAE Systems leased about 80,000 square feet at Liberty Station in Point Lorna, he added. Buildings Lose Value Some analysts were disturbed when Seaview Corporate Center in Sorrento Mesa sold for about $17 million less than the $92 million the property sold for in 2004. \"There are huge write-downs in com\u00ad mercial real estate,\" said Marino. \"When you talk about our market, the word on the street is the billldings have lost 30 to 40 percent of their value from the peak a couple of years ago.\" Stacey Hansen, a senior property manager at Irvine-based Essex Realty Management Inc., doesn't foresee a quick turnaround. \"I figure there will be see-through build\u00ad ings for a while,\" she said. \"No occupancy. You see from one window out the other.\" Nevin was more hopeful, asserting that \u00b7some firms will take advantage of low leases and reduced building costs to make new transactions before the economy turns around.

County By EMMET PIERCE Analysts agree that the industrial sec\u00ad tor of the commercial real estate market in Sa:n Diego County has taken a beating during the past two years, but opinions differ when it comes to how quickly it will recover. Alan Nevin, director of economic re\u00ad search for MarketPointe Realty Advisors, expects the industrial sector to bounce back as the overall economy makes a comeback. \"Our industrial users for the most part are local, and space will be filled up,\" Nevin said. \"It will probably take another two years or so to get back to some degree of normalcy. There is noth\u00ad ing new being built. As a result of that, it will not be that difficult to fill up the space. We will recover and it will not take that long.\" Not everyone is as optimistic , how\u00ad ever. \"There is a sea change occurring in our economy in San Diego, such that the traditional industrial users are slowly evacuating the county,\" said real estate economist Gary London of The London Group. \"Industrial single-story , tilt-up construction in the far north, far east and south counties, that part of our inventory is not going to expand much or at all in the coming years as we continue to lose manufacturingjobs. There is substantially reduced growth, if not a compression in the industrial sector.\" San Diego is not nearly as competitive in industrial markets as it was during the previous century, London said. In the future, there will be more people working in offices rather than industrial complexes , he added. Recession's Impact Although there are differing opinions about the recovery, no one doubts the serious impact of the ongoing recession. \"We ~learly are in the worst commercial real estate recession we have had since the early '90s,\" said David Marino, a principal at David Marino Irving Hughes Inc., a real estate company that represents ten\u00ad ants. \"This commercial real estate train wreck started in 2008.\" Nevin pointed out that there have been ANNUAL INDUSTRIAL NEW CONSTRUCTION VS VACANCY RATE San Diego County, 1999-2009: I D New construction Vacancy rate 4.5 10% 8.69% 4.0 9% ~ ~ .._ <::: Q) ~ Q) Q... SDBJ graphic bright spots in the industrial market dur\u00ad ing the past two years. \"What you find is it is really a matter of location and quality,\" he said. If you look at the industrial markets at the edges of the county -north, east and south-you will find vacancy rates of 15 percent to 25 percent, Nevin ex\u00ad plained. However, in central areas, such as Kearny Mesa, the vacancy rate for industrial properties is in the 6 percent to 8 percent range. \"The further you get from the core of the county, the higher the vacancy rate goes,\" he said. One aspect that is helping industrial building owners is the massive number of federal, state and local infrastructure projects that are going on, said Nevin. \"Those contractors are renting indus\u00ad trial space and often office as well,\" he said. \"The military is spending $5 billion here.\" Construction Slump Perhaps, but industrial construction levels are down to their lowest levels in the past 10 years, said Dennis Visser, an industrial specialist with Grubb & EllisiBRE Commercial San Diego. Manu\u00ad facturers are favoring existing inventory, and discounted leases, over new con\u00ad struction. Building new facilities simply doesn't make sense when you can lease more cheaply. \"Over the last five years, we have aver\u00ad aged in San Diego roughly 2. 7 million square feet of new industrial product per year,\" be said. \"In 2009, we had only 300,000 square feet added. It is grinding to a halt .. This year will be that or less.\" ,. Industrial page 15 Mixed-Use Projects Keep Hope for Retail Expansion Afloat REAL ESTATE: Recovery Tied to Return of Lending, Consumer Confidence By MARK LARSON Tough conditions for commercial retail in Sa,n Diego appear to have bottomed out from last year's recession , and brokers and analysts say the market will bounce back with more jobs and more lending. \"We don't think it's going to get much lower,\" said Tony Volpe, acquisitions ana\u00ad lyst for American National Investments , a San Diego-based real estate firm. \"We are seeing lending again.\" Others in the industry agree that there's nowhere to go now but up. But they see a slow recovery ahead, linked to more jobs, which bring more consumer confidence , and more lending, which helps retailers set up shop in available space. \"Retail's hurting,\" says Volpe, remem\u00ad bering the last retail deal his firm did was a Lowe's home improvement store in Escon\u00ad dido four years ago. \"Unfortunately , we're still seeing national retailers leaving.\" Meanwhile , be says, regional retailers are struggling , too. \"People aren't buying as many goods right now.\" Vince Provenzano , director of broker\u00ad age services for the commercial real estate firm NAI San Diego, agrees. \"People need to feel comfortable with their employment, No. 1, to bring them back to Vince Provenzano being consumers,\" said Provenzano. The weak economy has forced down lease rates for retailers, however, allowing some to get space they couldn't afford in better times. These days, San Diego retail lease rates are on average 20 percent to 40 percent below peak rates of 2007, reflecting the presence of empty space in the market. High Vacancy Rates Retail vacancies in San Diego among 50,000-square -foot shopping centers and above are now at 7 percent. And spaces being marketed because current tenants are moving out are at 9.3 percent. Those are the highest rates in 15 years, says Joe Yetter, retail specialist at Grubb & EllisiBRE Commercial, who has been involved in the retail brokerage industry in San Diego since 1986. But as long as those vacancies stay below double-digits , landlords ca:ri live with them, he adds. And because San Diego isn't overbuilt for retail, \"We're in the top 20 percent of healthy markets throughout the country, particularly the West,\" said Yetter. \"The fact that we're not wildly overbuilt will help absorb the vacuum we have over the next three years at slowly recovering (lease) rates.\" These days, says ANI's Volpe, retail space developments are generally part of a mixed-use project, as in the ground floor of an office, condo or apartment high-rise. He cites Broadway Lofts downtown and Aqua Vista in Little Italy as examples, along with the House of Blues in the Se San Diego Hotel. Leasing Loses Momentum Joe Haeussler , senior vice president of McMillin Commercial in San Diego, says his company operates about 375,000 square feet of retail at the 350-acre, mixed-use Liberty Station development in Point Lorna, with tenants including Vons, Trader Joe's, Ace Hardware Corp. and a long list of others. McMillin also has occupied retail space at Quarry Creek in Carlsbad. Tenants include Albertsons , a yogurt shop that oc\u00ad cupies space recently vacated by Starbucks Corp., a Jamba Juice, a Greek cafe and a nail salon. \"2009 was definitely a very tough year for leasing momentum in retail,\" said Hae\u00ad ussler. \"Deals were not at the pace we would have liked. The outlook for 2010 is for much the same unless consumer spending Joe Haeussler and confidence comes back with more loans for busin.esses .\" Haeussler says a current deal in the works with a regional retail tenant illustrates how tough conditions are. Tenants typically raise enough cash to pay for 20 percent of the money needed to move into a new space, he says. They then get tenant improvements from the building owner and get the balance of needed financing through a Small Busi\u00ad ness Administration loan. \"The SBA component dried up,\" says Haeussler. \"Then there's too much capital to raise, and tenants look to the landlords to provide that.\" That has his company talking to its lender in the hope of closing the financing gap, a first for McMillin. \"Our lender is asking a lot of questions . They're in direct contact with the tenant,\" said Haeussler. \"It's a tough situation. But it can create absorption that otherwise wouldn't occur.\" Small mom-and-pop retailers are also cash-starved, finding difficulty in getting lines of credit or equity from their homes to finance their stores. Knocking On Doors This year, said Haeussler , \"If the game plan is to sit and wait for the phone to ring, it's going to be a quiet year.\" So McMillin 's strategy is to have a full court press on potential clients with its sales staff. \"We'll continue to knock on doors,\" he said. Currently, the company has 60,000 square feet of available retail space in one building, which could handle between 10 and 30 tenants, depending on the size needs of tenants coming in. Maybe the company will strike gold with what is considered a good sign of a retail industry comeback. When clothing retailers start popping up, says Haeussler , good things typically follow. For this year, however, retail specialist Yetter has no great expectations. \"The feeling is things are not going to get dramatically better, but they're not go\u00ad ing to get dramatically worse,\" said Yetter. \"The fact that we're bouncing along the bottom is, I think, a good thing.\" Still, that \"bumping along\" might con\u00ad tinue another 12 to 18 months be adds. One of the delays to the recovery will be the time required to work out failed commercial mortgages that have been bundled and sold as securi\u00ad ties. Many of those will come due in the next three years, when those serving those loans will have to take Joe Yetter action on them with various financial rem\u00ad edies. So far, little or no action is being taken on failed commercial mortgages , says Yetter, and he figures that isn't likely to change until the feds order action once the loans mature. Meanwhile , says Yetter, investors have formed on the sidelines, looking for bar\u00ad gain loan buyouts of valuable properties at 25 cents to 50 cents of a loan's dollar amount. But in San Diego, there are few retail properties in that category. But it is happening in Las Vegas, Phoenix and in San Bernardino , he says, where there is much more empty retail space.

January 25, 2010 SAN DIEGO BUSINIESS JOURNAL -Special Report www.sdbj.com Plgl15 Expansion in Multifamily Residential Banks on Continued Demand DEVEI.OPPt9lr: Quarry Falls Alone Planning 4, 700 Homes, Including 800 Apartments By MARK LARSON Multifamily r~sidential development is alive and well ih San Diego, with projects under way anticipating future demand for high-density infill development. San Diego-lDased developer Sudberry Properties Inc.'s multi-phased Quarry Falls in Mission Valley, and downtown projects by Houston-based The Hanover Co. -Strata and Current- are projects anticipating that demand from San Diego residents. A variety of residential development is planned for the 230-acre in:fill development of Quarry Falls, which will be built in four phases during a 12-to 15-year period. When built out, Quarry Falls will in\u00ad clude an estimated 4, 700 variously priced homes, including 800 multifamily apart\u00ad ments. Other types of dwellings to be built will be live/work homes, flats, row houses, condominiums, townhomes, and an estimated 175 senior housing units. Ten percent of the planned housing will qualify as affordable housing. \u00b7 Along with -open space and several small parks, the project will ultimately include more than 1 million square feet of office and retail space for shops and restaurants. A kindergarten through eighth grade public charter school will be built and run by High Tech High. To reduce the need for cars, the project will have a shuttle system, a hybrid car-sharing program, and a network of hiking, biking and walking trails. The project was approved by the city of San Diego just over a year ago, and is now in its design phase. Construction of the first phase is planned for late this year, says Marco Sessa, Sudberry's senior vice presi\u00ad dent of residential land development. Financing Challenges But arranging financing remains a chal\u00ad lenge, he says. \"A lot of what's being financed is through government-insured lending, Fan\u00ad nie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA and HUD,\" said Sessa. But there is optimism that lending terms will loosen up this year. Because there hasn't been much housing built locally in the past two years, Sessa sees pent-up demand for it. Especially for an environ\u00ad mentally friendly development that enables a visit to a neighbor or store by foot or bi\u00ad cycle. The project's features won it a Gold certification from LEED, or L~tadersfup iE< !Energy and Environmental :Ip.esign, :ca. set of design standards of the U.S. Green Building Council. The Hanover Co., meanwhile, has two downtown high-rise luxury apartment buildings. Current, a $70 million project completed in November 2007, has 146 units in its 12 stories in the Little Italy neighborhood. And in the East Village is Strata, a 22-story, $110 million project that is nearing completion. Aimed at the top end of the rental market, both projects offer first-floor retail. Strong Rental Market Eric Kenney, acquisition and develop\u00ad ment partner for Hanover, says next to the Bay Area, San Diego is the second stron\u00ad gest apartment rental market in the state. He notes that the rental occupancy rate downtown is around 95 percent. \"It's unbelievable, ' he said. \"It's a testa- Eric Kenney ment to the strength of the market. Businesses are still employ\u00ad ing people. It's not as dire as some other parts of the country.\" Factors contributing to the high demand are a tight inventory of rental units, and the long lead time and expense of getting new projects approved ,' financed and built Industrial: r+ from page 14 From 2004 to 2008, net absorptions in the county averaged 2.5 million square feet per year, he added. That was roughly at the same point as inventory growth. In 2009, there was a negative absorption of 4.2 million square feet countywide . \"In 2010, it is not going to get signifi\u00ad cantly better,\" Visser said. \"The negative absorption will be less, maybe in the 1 to 2 million-square-foot range and back to a positive net absorption in 2011.\" Despite his guarded outlook, Visser said some areas of the county are now to add to the curr nt apartment in en\u00ad tory. \"We like San Diego very mu b \" aid Kenney. \"It has a great quality f liD , diverse employment.

Mickey Morera, a senior director with commercial real estate services firm Cush\u00ad man & Wakefield Inc., said he expects better times ahead as the region works its way out of the recession . \"Tenants are starting to look for space and plan for the future,\" he said.

This month, the 43-year-old vice president and general manager at Turner Construction Co. in San Diego embarked on his most daring and largest project yet: A three-year , $471 million contract for a 470,000-square-foot expansion of Terrninal2 at the San Diego International Airport. Turner and its sister company, PCL Construction Services Inc., will manage the construction. Nearly half of Turner's local staff, 50 out of 104 employees, will work alongside the terminal development team, support\u00ad ing 75 to 100 subcontractors to execute the following plan: A three-story , 1 0-gate expansion of Terminal2 , including ticket lobby, airline check-in , security screening and baggage handling. The project also involves adding 1.5 million square feet of apron, a secured part of the airport where aircraft are parked, unloaded or loaded, refueled, or boarded. Awford's biggest concern: Maintaining normal airport operations. But be's up to the challenge. \"We don't get the easy projects at Turner,\" Awford said. \"We get the com\u00ad plex, challenging projects that have a level of complexity the average contractor wouldn't be able to achieve.\" Turner has 46 offices nationwide and is owned by Ger\u00ad man construction gi\u00ad ant HOCHTIEF AG. Turner, as a whole, has 5,500 employees and more than $10 billion in annual billings. For 2010, Awford Jamie Awford projects his office will achieve $250 million in annual billings, boosted by the lucrative air\u00ad port deal, up from $191 million in 2009. Reputation Speaks Volumes Existing clients describe Awford as a person of integrity and a problem-solver. Awford's expertise , willingness to go the extra mile, and high integrity ultimately paved the way for other contracts. Bo0ne Hellmann, associate vice chan\u00ad cellor for facilities design and construction and campus architect at UC San Diego, said a high score on a personnel evaluation landed Awford's team a four-year , $105 million contract to build a 14-story student housing building at UCSD. In 2004, when rising construction costs coupled with inflation quickly outpaced the $105 million budget, Hellmann re\u00ad called the two men had to work hand-in\u00ad hand to make the budget workable. \"Jamie and I had to form a cohesive bond and trust,\" Hellmann said. To make the budget fit and meet their deadline, they decided to cut the occupan\u00ad cy rate from the originally planned 1,200 students to 1,000 and opted for a less costly exterior wall system. The strategy worked. The North Campus housing project wa finished last September. Debbie Murray, coordinator of pro\u00ad gram planning at Grossmont Union High School District, said Awford s successful bid to salvage a project led the district to award Turner consecutive contracts exceeding $40 million. In January 2007, the district awarded Awford's office a $20 million contract from another contracto r to overhaul seven buildings , located at Grossmont High School and Helix High School. \"The buildings are so old that we had a lot of challenging conditions ,\" Murray re\u00ad called of the aging structures , some dating back to the 1920s. \"When things slipped, Jamie really helped his employees deal with difficult situations.\" \u00b7 Consequently , Awford's office landed another $18 million contract to build a two-story science building with 1 0 elassrooms on both campuses, which are near completion , and a third to renovate the Grossmont District's historic office building. Coach Gives A Boost Alex Nester, president , chief executive and founder of the La Jolla-based execu\u00ad tive coaching fum Nester Consulting , said he surprised about Awford's success. \"Jamie is very professional , very detail\u00ad oriented and passionate about what be does,\" Nester said. Nester :first offered his services as a life coach to help Awford deal with his pro\u00ad fessional and personal boundaries , then offered psychological consulting to his executive team. Awford credits Nester with helping him o ercome hi o n per i and enhancing the orp rat ment. E eryone ha barrier , all ha e tuff, Awford aid. \"We (the Turn r ' u\u00ad ti e team) are a tighter-bonded gr up, and knowing our tr ngth and eakn we help each other through chall nging issues.' Awford said he fell into the on tructi n business after earning a two-ear d gree in business communicat ion from aHl Community College in 1988. \"I ve been in love with (con' tructi o) ever since, ' Awford aid. Awford joined Turners San Diego office in 2003 as business development manager was promoted to busine unit manager in 2006, and in January 2007, became 1ce president and general manager. Special Interests Now be even builds on his own time. \"Currently, I'm helping my oldest son rebuild a '67 Mustang ,\" said Awford about a project with his 18-year-old son, Johnny who studies music production at San Di\u00ad ego City College. He has another 14-year-old son, Spen\u00ad cer, who enjoys skateboarding . During his downtim e, the Mission Hills resident also enjoys cooking, running and traveling. And he gives back to the com\u00ad munity as a member of the local board of directors for Habitat for Humanity Inter\u00ad national, which builds affordable housing, and for the ACE Mentor Program, which introduces students to opportunitie s in con\u00ad struction , architecture and engineering.

Looking at the San Diego Business Journal's C0mmercia l Real Estate Bro\u00ad kerages lists for 2010 and 2009, the major difference is rooted in the split between BRE Commercial San Diego and Grubb & Ellis Co. The brokerages are ranked by dollar value of 2009 San Diego County transactions. As of March 1, BRE Commercia l will be known as Cassidy Turley BRE Com\u00ad mercial. John D. Frager serves as president and CEO of BRE Commercia l. Cassidy Turley grabbed the No.2 rank\u00ad ing on the newly released list with $822 mil\u00ad lion in local transactions , trumped only by longtime competitor CB Richard Ellis, Jed locally by Senior Managing Director Mark Read, with $1.56 billion in transactions. On last year's list, Grubb & Ellis/BRE Commerc ial sat atop the rankings with $1.55 billion in local transactions in 2008, while CB Richard Ellis held down the No. 2 position with a figure of $1.53 billion. Cushman & Wakefield 's San Diego of\u00ad fice, run by Executive Managing Director Stath Karras, secured the No. 3 spot on this year's list with $774 million in trans\u00ad actions. Irving Hughes, managed by principals Craig Irving, Jason Hughes and Dave Marino, grabbed the No.4 ranking with $721 million in transactions. Marcus & Millichap Real Estate Invest-SAN DIEGO BUSINESS JOURNAL www.sdbj.com File photo John D. F1rager, left, and Jonathan Freeman are part of the team moving BRE Commercial San Diego into a new alliance with Cassidy Turley. ment Services, led by Kent R. Williams, the first vice president and regional manager, rounded out the top five with $441 million in transactions. Among the brokerages that appeared on last years and this year's lists, only one moved more than three spots up or down. Goldman Ferguson Partners achieved the No. 13 ranking this year, four places better than a year earlier, despite the fact that its dollar value in local transactions declined 9 percent to $75 million. Last year's list had the top three brokerages with more than $1 billion each in local trans-actions, but only the top brokerage on this year's list totaled more than $1 billion. Ad\u00ad ditionally, there was a significant drop from the No. 1 and No.2 spots on this year's list, as top-ranked CB Richard Ellis had almost double the dollar value in local transactio ns in 2009 than econd-ranked Cassidy Turley. The largest percentage gain in the dollar value of local transactions is illustrated by fourth-ranked Irving Hughes, which saw a 26 percent gain from last year's figures, increasing from $570 million to $721 million. The largest percentage loss was from CDC Commercial Real Estate, which saw its transactions drop from $25 million in 2008 to $11 mirlion in 2009, a 57 percent decline. It secured the last spot on this year's 19-brokerage list after being ranked 21st on last year's 22-brokerage Est.

The hard work is paying off with financial health and a reputa\u00ad tion for anracting top quality staff. To ensure your best people stay in top form, you need a health plan that delivers the best quality health care for your investment. A top performing health plan that offers affordable, well-structured, integrated services can actually help your business stay at its com\u00ad petitive best by keeping employees healthy and productive. Not just reducing employee sick days, but proactivel y helping employees with chronic conditions and risk factors so they can avoid health problems in the long term. An effectively managed , flexible health plan should offer multiple options with no more cost than offering just one. Efficient account management with easy online services, instant access ro financial and enrollment data, and plenty of resources to make benefit manage\u00ad ment streamlined , all help employers spend their energy where it really maners- on doing business. Employees Look for Comprehensive Health Plans A comprehensive health plan helps busi\u00ad nesses recruit and retain top talent. Employees are anracted to companies that offer health plans that provide all the services they and their families need with plenty of options, flexibility and consumer choice. A coverage package with choices, services, resources and tools is the gold standard for health plans. Co-payments, deductibles, HMOs, PPOs, our-of-area coverage, premium savings and tax advantages are sought-after options. Combining all these elements with easy benefits administration gives companies time to focus on their business goals, not on benefits paperwork. HMO deductibles , co-insurance, cost-shar\u00ad ing options and our-of-pock et maximums offer broad coverage with lower premiums to satisfY company budget needs while providing employ\u00ad ees with quality health care. Similar to traditional HMO plans, these plans provide employers maximum flexibility in offering their workers health plans for their individual needs. Health savings accounts combined with de\u00ad ductible plans are available for business owners and employees who want to invest in cover\u00ad age options designed to protect financial and physical health. Blending premium savings and tax advantages offers employees an incentive to save for their health care costs and empowers them to manage their health care dollars in much the same way they manage retirement dollars. HSAs offer employees pre-tax payroll deductions and businesses tax-free contribu\u00ad tions. Both the company and employees save on Social Security and Medicare taxes. Comprehen sive health plans offer a range of health education classes, from allergy and asthma to heart health, parenting and yoga. Health assessments, weight loss programs , diet and exercise counseling, smoking cessation , and stress reduction should be standard fare. Even affinity program discounts and preferred rates for services not offered by the health plan ought to be readily available as part of the service. Top quality health plans are designed to engage employees in the management of their own health, providing the resources they seek and helping them understand the impact they can have in achieving better health.

Not just reducing employee sick days, but proactively helping employees with chronic conditions and risk factors so they can avoid health problems in the long term. treatment and information technology are all basics in high-quality health plans. Electronic medical records are helping provide online ac\u00ad cess to patients' medical information , allowing employees to spend more productive time at the workplace -in bener health. Kaiser Permanente is responding to market dynamics with innovative products, tiered ben\u00ad efit plans and consumer-directed health plans that lower premiums. Options that feature cost-sharing with employees, working with employers to bring wellness ro the workplace , and outstanding medical care with maximum choice are all part of our commitment to the rotal health of our patients. Integrated Health Care Delivery System Kaiser Permanente 's hallmark is the ability ro integrate the elements of health care-phy\u00ad sicians, hospitals, home health, support func\u00ad tions and insurance -into a coherent whole. The power of an integrated health care system lies in its potential to create an environment that supports innovation and quality improve\u00ad ment. Our integrated structure puts people and systems together in ways that enable us ro achieve more than we could by working alone or in a fragmented system. With Kaiser Perma\u00ad nente, consumers don't just buy insurance. For a fixed monthly fee, they buy a membership in an organized system that provides preventive , routine, specialized and hospital care. Preventive medicine has changed the eco\u00ad nomics of medicine by focusing on keeping the patient healthy, rather than just treating sickness. By offering a broad benefits package without financial barriers, Kaiser Permanente encourages patients to seek care before a medical problem becomes serious, requiring more costly treatment and longer sick leave. Knowing their patients will not be financiall y burdened also allows physicians to base their clinical decisions solely on what is medically appropriate for the patient. Our integrated system allows physicians ro provide care in the setting that best meets the patient's needs, be it at the hospital, medical office or patient's home. Our approach to health care delivery maxi\u00ad mizes the value of the employers' and employ\u00ad ees' health care dollars. We provide excellent, evidence-based medicine, and are committed to identifYing and treating populations'\u00b7 with high-risk conditions, as well as populations needing screening and prevention services. Beyond sick care, hospitalization and rou\u00ad tine checkups , Kaiser Permanent e clinicians identifY and engage high-risk patients and those with chronic illnesses in care manage\u00ad ment programs with strong outreach and health education programs. Comprehensive disease managem ent programs include in\u00ad terventions beginning with the primary care medical team to behavioral health specialists, nurses, pharmacists, to personal case managers and care coordinators. A comprehef)sive health education and wellness program offers patients a full range of classes and support groups to help them prepare for medical procedures and learn about managing their chronic conditions, as well as opportunities to take part in programs to achieve their best possible health. Kaiser Permanente encourages patients to take an active role in improving their own health. By emphasizing prevention and well\u00ad ness, executing effective care management pro\u00ad grams within a system of integrated care, and providing easy access to health improvement programs , education , member incentives and decision support tools, we present the founda\u00ad tion necessary to encourage patients to actively participate in their health care. Providing the Best in Health Care Innovation Kaiser Permanente 's commitment to inno\u00ad vative information technologies is improving clinical care, streamlining business operations and providing Web-based services to patients. The program, Kaiser Permanente Health Con\u00ad nect, allows clinicians real-time access to data on medical conditions, drug interactions , best practices, centers of excellence, research, clini\u00ad cal trials and treatment options.

The region, which even has its own Olympic Training Center, is home to a kaleidoscope of professional athletes, including surfers, skateboarders , wake boarders, triathletes , soccer players, football players and moto\u00ad cross champions . ' Spotts and entertainment is what defines us in Southern California ,\" said Walton. \"It's who we are as a people and as a culture. \"We are going to nurture our local sports and entertainment comp anies and do whatever we can to provide the as\u00ad sistance they need,\" he added. 'We want to make sure that this segment of the economy can maximize its potentiaL We want to help our region grow by building these businesses. \" Open Door Philosophy Walton said the new program will not only focus on sports and entertainment startups but also on more established , mature companies in the industry. \"There are constant issues that every business faces, and we will do whatever it takes to make sure that every company in our region and in our cluster can thrive and achieve its goals with the least amount of resistance possible,\" he said. \"It takes a team effort, vision, and creativity to over\u00ad come the obstacles that pop up on-a daily basis in business.\" The new program is an extension of CONNECT's Sports InnovatO'fs orga\u00ad nization, which was launched in 2007. CONNECT , a San Diego-based nonprofit business accelerator , is best known for its success in creating, supporting and grow\u00ad ing the region's high-tech , life sciences and clean-technology clusters. CONNECT , founded in 1985 at UC San Diego and developed into an independent nonprofit organization , has had much success with its CEO Strategy Forum and its flagship program, Springboard. Springboard offers free guidance and development to life sciences, clean-tech , high-tech and consumer product compa\u00ad nies in all stages of development , ranging from concept, technology transfer to startup, to companies that have reached a significant inflection point. Innovators are matched with Entrepreneurs in Resi\u00ad dence with related domain expertise and experience in raising capital and/or grow\u00ad ing companies. After receiving mentoring from Springbo ard, these companies have doubled their hiring of full-time staff and boosted their part-time workers by 250 percent, according to CONNECT. \"The ability to dream, create and build companies and implement new technolo\u00ad gies is what CONNECT is all about,\" Wal\u00ad ton said. \"(CONNECT CEO) Duane Roth and his team have an impeccable track record and have had fabulous success. I am honored, privileged , lucky and humbled to be a part of that team.\" Security Business Bank and the law firm Sheppard Mullin are the two initialfound\u00ad ing investors for Sports & Entertainment Innovators. Walton said he plans to raise enough funds, an unspecified amount, to make the organization independent within a year. \"We will do whatever it takes to get this important job done,' he said. High-Profile Leadership If Sports & Entertainment Innovators is expected to grow into an independent SAN DIEGO BUSINESS JOURNAL trade organization that can provide as\u00ad sistance to. San Diego's entire action, sports and team sports community , it needs focused, high-profile leadership , said Camille So brian, CONNECT's chief operating officer. \"Bill Walton has a thorough under- . standing of the sports industry from his experience as a Hall of Fame NBA all-star and award-winning TV sports commenta\u00ad tor,\" she said. \"He has the relationships and name recognition to mobilize commu\u00ad nity and industry support quickly around this innovative effort.\" Sports enterprises are among the largest business clusters in the region, boasting more than 600 sports-related companies , according to CONNECT That's compared to 600 life sciences companies , l,OOO\u00b7infor\u00ad mation technology and software firms, 300 defense companies and about 250 energy and environment-related companies in San Diego County. \"The sports and entertainment industry is a major economic force in San Diego, but unlike the defense, high-tech and life sci\u00ad ences industries, there are no organizations to support entrepreneurs in these growing companies, \" Sobrian said. \"San Diego is the center of innovation in action sports like surfing and skateboarding. All the trends start here. The entire industry looks to Southern California to define style and technology . If we are to retain our leader\u00ad ship position in an increasingly challenging economic environment we need to support this important business cluster.\" Sports & Entertainment Innovators will also educate entrepreneurs and business owners about \"green\" products and tech\u00ad nologies and how they can become more eco-friendly. \"Many sports that depend on the environment are actually anything but green,\" Sobrian said . \"So finding ways to save water and energy and create products that don't harm workers or the environ\u00ad ment will be an important part of this organization. \" Leading The Green Revolution Sobrian did point to a handful of sports-related companies that are helping lead the green revolution in this industry, such as San Diego-based Malama Com\u00ad posites LLC, which among other envi\u00ad ronmentally friendly composite materials . While action sports industries such as surfing and skateboarding are beginning to make smaller carbon footprints on the Earth, they eontinue to make a big eco\u00ad nomic impact. In fact, the surf/skate industry has shown notable resiliency during recent global economic challenges , posting U.S. retail sales of $7.22 billion in 2008, accord\u00ad ing to the Surf Industry Manufacturer s Association, aka SIMA. Although that was down slightly from 2006 ($7.48 bil-Melissa Jacobs Bill Walton, shown at Rusty Boardhouse in La Jolla, Is in charge of the new CONNECT Sports & Entertainment Innovators organization. is indicative of the types of that Walton will be working with in role. lion), the surf industry has shown substan\u00ad tial growth of 10 percent for the past five years, according to SIMA. While many companies in this industry have found success, there are still compa\u00ad nies arriving at strategic crossroad s in their business and are faced with challenging decisions ranging from distribution to hu\u00ad man resources and cash flow. So says Chad DiNenna , co-founder and director of mar\u00ad keting for Encinitas-based Nixon Inc. \"There are a myriad of challenges companies have in every business,\" said DiNenna , who co-founded the apparel and accessories company . in 1997 with friend and Stanford M.B.A. graduate Andy Laats. \"There is a wealth of successful business leaders here in San Diego who are willing to apply their lessons learned to a niche market like action sports. That's why it's cool to have an organization like Sports & Entertainme nt Innovators. It's a formal wa y to connect our industry to the San Diego business community.\" ~ DiNenna and Laats had their first experience with Sports & Entertainment Innovators during its beginning stages as CONNECT SL They were invited to a dinner meeting to talk about the success of Nixon and to educate investors and the business community at large about \"surfer\" CEOs. \"I explained they should not think of us as a bunch of surfer kids and beach bums who aren't serious about building a global brand that is highly successful ,\" DiNenna said. Dose Of Business Sense But that's not to say that companies in this very tight-knit , \"casual\" industry don't need more business sense. \"A lot of the powerhouse brands of today in the action sports industry were founded by professional surfers or skate\u00ad boarders who grew up in the industry,'' DiNenna said. \"Ten years ago it was un\u00ad common to find people who had M.B.A.s who were running these businesses. There was a pretty big disconnec t between big business and niche youth sports culture.\" Now with CONNECT' s Sports & Entertainment Innovators , action sports brands have a platform of experienced business professionals as a sounding board to help them solve the challenges of grow\u00ad ing businesses. The big boys are now definitely pay\u00ad ing attention to this untapped market, he said. \"Three years ago skateboarding surpassed baseball as the leading sport for young adults,\" he said. \"There are a lot of bean counters who are paying attention to what s happening and they recognize there are a lot of opportuniti es in this industry. ' Brian Enge, general manager of Vista\u00ad based Zoot Sports, can attest to that. In 2007, Enge presented his company to a room full of business leaders, capital www.sdbj.com provider and like-minded ntr pr n m during one of the fir t 0 meeting. For the pa t 25 ear , Zoot p rt , which was sold in January _009 to K2 Sports (owned by Jarden orp.), ha mad and sold training and racing product for triathlete including foot\\ ear, appar 1. wet suits and acce sorie . Cash And Mentorsbip Enge said there are two thing an entre\u00ad preneurial porting goods company need --cash and mentorship. They need cash becau e the are mainly inventory-ba ed businesse , aid Enge, who sits on the Sports & Entertain\u00ad ment Innovators board. When you grow it gobbles up cash. The mentorship is in1- portant because most of these bu in ses are run by passion-based inventors who don't have a strong foundation of business skills that will allow them to succeed. vVbat CONNECT does an amazing job at is taking these guys who have a passion, and through programs like Springboard help turn these passionate ideas into successful business plans . 'The biggest problem for young sporting goods companies is they have more passion than business experience or skills \" Enge added. \"Too often, these companies become mismanaged or they run out of cash. ' Tradition ally, venture capitalists have shied away from action sports and sporting goods companies , which are mainly funded by larger companies . Last year, CON\u00ad NECT's Sports Innovator program tried to help boost funding for local companies by holding the industry's first capital forum. Out of 50 applicants , CONNECT chose six companies to be mentored. \"The largest capital role in the action sports industry has been played by the gen\u00ad eration of people who have recently cashed out,\" said Marco Thompson , founding director of CONNECT's Sports Innova\u00ad tors program and now a board member of the new organization. \"If you want to see interesting things happening , look at the guys who just made $100 million or more by selling their brand to a larger compan y. Now they are in their garage working with their friends on two to five new projects that are on their way over the next five years to becoming significant Southern California startup companies. That cash is being recycled. \"CONNECT can help these companies by providing networking opportunit ies and connecting those who have had suc\u00ad cess in thi industry with new entrepre\u00ad neurs,\" added Thompson, also vice chair of CONNECT and managing director of Express Ventures. Innovation is also the lifeblood of the sports and entertainment industry, Thompson said. That's why San Diego is the perfect place to breed such a pioneer\u00ad ing industry. \"When I started this program inside of CONNECT there were a number of board members who said 'What's inno\u00ad vative about a T-shirt company? At the end of the day there are huge innovations going on in many of these companies with re pect to the materials being used. For example, we have Malama Composite and local skateboard companies like Flexdex LLC that are working with modern and green composite materials. There is a vi\u00ad brant group of companies that are building helmets with Bluetooth communications in them, and companies that are making quick-dry materials for board shorts, and socks made out of bamboo. We have seen and will continue to see so many innovative things in this industry. Andrea Siedsma is a freelance writer for the Business Jounwl. Page 88 www.sdbj.com Camp Pendleton: *frompagel ---------------- ---- of base construction jobs worth billions --drew more than 500 people to the South Mesa Club. The region's Marine Corps bases, largely in Southern California, will un\u00ad dergo $5.4 billion worth of construction in the next five years, said Capt. Joseph A. Campbell , officer in charge of con\u00ad struction for Marine Corps Installations West. Marine Corps Installations West is the office that oversees the infrastructure for seven Marine Corps bases in South\u00ad ern California , Northern California and Arizona. The plum project will be a half-bil\u00ad lion-dollar hospital near the main gate of Camp Pendleton, set to be awarded before the federal fiscal year ends Sept. 30. Cost estimates for the project have varied. The hospital was originally envisioned as a $563 million project, but at least one officer has pegged its cost at $600 million. The current fiscal year will see 3,200 construction workers at Camp Pendle\u00ad ton, Campbell said, up from 800 in fiscal 2008. Small Fish, Big Fish The Jan. 15 event was partly an op\u00ad portunity for small contractors to meet up with their larger counterparts . The big contractors must team up with small businesses to fulfill the terms of their con\u00ad struction deals. Among those asking for small-business help was a three-company joint venture that intends to go for the hospital contract: Illinois-based Power Construction Co., Hawaii-based Watts Constructors LLC, and Webcor Builders, which is based in North\u00ad em California and has a San Diego office. The other focus of the meeting was a deal set aside expressly for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. The pact, which has yet to be awarded, is potentially worth $15 million over five years. Under the deal, called a job order contract or JOC, the government would issue task Amira: *from page 1 -------------------- tory conditions. The scientific team, led by Merck San Diego's former head of medicinal chemis\u00ad try, Peppi Prasit, soon attracted a group of venture investors who helped the company secure major pharmaceutical partnerships with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, better known as Roche, and GlaxoSmithKline pic. in just a few years. Prasit, who admits he didn't know a single venture capitalist when the com\u00ad pany formed, said he felt confident the team's experience would drive new drug discoveries. \"I just felt at that time we could do as well as anybody couJ.d in the biotech industry,\" he said. No Shortage Of Funds In five years, the company has success\u00ad fuJ.ly demonstrated it could raise money --$28 million in venture funding-- and secure major pharmaceutical partner\u00ad ships. The Roche research collaboration, val\u00ad ued at $287 million plus royalties, ended in 2008. But its partnership with GSK, worth a potential $425 million if all the regula\u00ad tory and developmental benchmarks are met, continues to help finance the young SAN DIEGO BUSINESS JOURNAL orders for minor construction projects at Camp Pendleton and the adjacent naval weapons station. The pact includes one base year and four option years, and carries a minimum guar\u00ad antee of $5,000 in work. Task orders can range from $2,000 to $1 million, according to FedBizOpps.gov, a federal government Web site lhat lists contracting opportuni \u00ad ties with the U.S. government. The government will issue its request for proposals around Feb. 10 and may hold a pre-proposal conference shortly thereafter, according to the Web site. Rick Fowler, president of Julian-based Rick Fowler Construction, praised the set-aside for service-disabled veterans. However, he said, the $15 million contract comes with a Catch-22 situation: It forces small businesses to team up, or form joint ventures, because individua l firms are not able to get bonding without losing their small-business status. 'Gather Intel' Another part of the Jan. 15 session sounded like a pep talk for weary, would\u00ad be federal contractors. Campbell acknowledged that working with the federal government can be daunt\u00ad ing. \"We have a lot of rules,\" he told the audience, \"but we're happy to help you work through those ruJ.es.\" Capt. William Whittenberg , director of facilities for Marine Corps Installations West, advised his audience to \"gather in\u00ad tel before the campaign. \" Know the rules of the procurement process, read the fine print, go to the pre-proposal conference , and ask questions. \"Very few of us know the procurement process fully,\" said Whittenberg, who addeq that it's easy to feel one's company has been arbitrarily denied when it hasn't read the rules. \"Have your in-house quality control person read your proposal,\" he added. Ultimately , Whittenberg said, patience is rewarded . \"If you keep doing good things, if you keep doing right things, you'll get the work,\" the captain said. 'It's (going public) not 201 0, I think, but it's probably not far beyond that.' company. -Bob Baltera CEO ofAmira Amira, which has 50 employees, said Jan. 7 that it successfully developed experi\u00ad mental asthma treatment AM103 in pill form, triggering an undisclosed milestone payment. CEO Bob Baltera said the GSK deal, struck in early 2008 before the collapse of the financial markets, has allowed Amira to focus on its drug discovery efforts with\u00ad out worrying about raising additional capital \"We haven't had to raise money the whole time I've been here because of this deal,\" he said. Going Public Baltera, who recently returned from the annual J.P Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, said he's encouraged by all the recent biotech investment activity and would consider taking the company public. Sempra: *frompagel -------------------- Among other key local changes an\u00ad nounced by Sempra is that Michael Niggli, chief operating officer for SDG&E and So\u00ad Cal Gas, will become president and COO of SDG&E, reporting to Knight. Reed, 53, held the top SDG&Ejob since 2006 after working as president and chief operating officer for both of Sempra's utilities. She joined SoCalGas in 1978 as a systems engineer, and a decade later became the company's first female execu\u00ad tive officer. Not A New Strategy Sempra spokesman Doug Kline said the company has conducted other top management rotations in the past several years, most recently in 2006. That one in\u00ad volved 12 executives, including Reed, and the hiring of Knight. Michael Shames, executive director for Utility Consumers' Action Network, said while a commissioner on the California Public Utilities Commission, Knight was a proponent of dereguJ.ation, and had a distrust of monopoly utilities. \"As an outsider, Jessie has the op\u00ad portunity to effect some serious reform within SDG&E and promote a corpo\u00ad rate culture of innovation and efficiency that I've found lacking in the company ,\" Shames said. Perhaps the biggest project on Sempra's plate that has engendered major criticism is its plan to build a massive power trans\u00ad mission line from the Imperial Valley to San Diego. Called the Sunrise Powerlink , the project initially was to traverse the middle of the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, the state's largest. But last year, the company changed the route, moving it south but still crossing through parts of the vast parkland . The estimated cost of the project is $1.88 billion, according to SDG&E. SDG&E has also taken lots of criticism for allegedly having a role in the start of some of the 2007 wildfires in the county. \"It's not 2010, I think, but it's probably not far beyond that,\" said Baltera, a former Amgen Inc. veteran who came to Amira in 2007. Eventually , he said, Amira will look to the public markets to fund costly clinical trials of a drug for treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a deadly buildup of tissue deep in the lungs that can lead to respiratory failure. The condition has also shown up in some of the survivors of the Sept. 11 attacks. Unlike its drugs for asthma and COPD, Baltera said Amira intends to take the puJ.\u00ad monary fibrosis drug to the market on its own, where it couJ.d target lung specialists with a small sales force. Baltera, who spent 17 years at Amgen before taking the helm at Amira, said the company will have to demonstrate the drug's effectiveness first, and make sure its safety is well profiled. Vioxx, a $2.5 billion drug withdrawn from the U.S. market in 2004 due to increased risk of heart attack, brought attention to the importance of toxicology studies, he said. But the promise of filling a void in current treatment options offers Amira's scientists hope for the roughly 200,000 people living with the condition . Doctors know little about what causes the lung scarring, so finding an effective treatment has proven elusive. January 25, 2010 \"There's no question that we've stum\u00ad bled along the way,\" said Knight of Sempra's management of its Powerlink plans and other issues. Knight said he's excited about the pros\u00ad pect for helping design and communicate a much clearer picture of what SDG&E is, and its benefits to the community. While most customers are happy with the service and reliability record SDG&E has, there's been some challenges associ\u00ad ated with some of the new projects the company is doing, such as building the Powerlink line, he said. Solid Reputation Knight has a reputation as a straight shooter who galvanized what had been a dysfunctional San Diego Regional Cham\u00ad ber of Commerce during the six years he presided over the area's top business group. Many local leaders credited Knight with helping to turn the chamber around. Before he took the position, the group's budget had a $600,000 deficit, and when he left, there was a surplus of $1.2 million, according to a 2006 story in the San Diego Business Journal. Before taking the chamber job, Knight was at the.CPUC for six years, and before that he held management positions at the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce , the San Francisco Chronicle and San Francisco Examiner , and at Dole Food Co. Inc. As CEO of the second largest segment of Sempra (SoCalGas has about 1 000 more employees than SDG&E) , Knight will oversee a staff of 5,070. Sempra s worldwide staff is 13,600, including about 800 on the corporate side. Sempra, which serves some 29 million consumers and is listed as SRE on the New York Stock Exchange, had revenue of $10.7 billion in 2008, down from $11.4 billion in 2007. Through the end of September , Sempra reported net income of $831 million on revenue of $5.6 billion. That compared with $794 million in net income on revenue of $8.5 billion for the same period in 2008. Promising Drug A paper published in Nature Medicine in 2008 by Dr. Andrew Tager, a puJ.mon\u00ad ologist, and his colleagues at Massachu\u00ad setts General Hospital shed light on some of the mechanisms of fibrosis, which he described as a \"repair gone awry.\" Tager hypothesized that, in some people, a receptor known as LPA1 has an over\u00ad active response to injury, leading to the buildup of scar tissue. \"You have too much repair and you develop a scar and that causes a loss of tissue function,\" he said. Amira's drug, which targets \u00b7the LPA1 receptor, demonstrated last year that it couJ.d reduce lung scarring in mice. Tager said the drug has also shown promise against other fibrotic conditions , such as cirrhosis of the liver and some forms of kidney disease, making it an even bigger product if approved. The next big step will be to test the drug in humans, which Amira's Baltera said is planned for the second half of the year. Meanwhile , Baltera said the company is engaged in talks with a partner for its early stage Phase 1 asthma and COPD programs. 'Big Pharma still has relative need for big products, \" he said. ''A lot of the source of that is still going to come from small biotech companies. \" January 25, 2010 SAN DIEGO BUSINESS JOURNAl www.sdbj.com MARKETPLACE I SanDi~oPublicSro~ ---- Index Watch EXCHANGE TICKER COMPANY NAME PRICE PRICE NET PERCENT 52-WEEK 52-WEEK_ SHARES MARKET 18000) SYMBOL 111912010 Net Change -o.13 -8.97% 2.87 0.53 30550 40326 NYSE AHS AMN 11.00 SOBJ S&P 1.43% 190372.2 Top Gainers & losers NASD HILL DOT HILL SYSTEMS CORP. 1.79 1.96 -o.17 -8.67% 2.83 0.40 CAPITAL BAN INC. 0.02 0.02 0.00 0.00% 2.00 0.02 5430 108.6 Leap Wireless 1119564.4 Top Percentage IN THE BOX INC. 20.55 20.02 0.53 2.65% 28.35 16.59 57290 1177309.5 39732 Nanogen 0,01 58200 582 NASD KTOS 0.21 0.20 0.01 5.00% 3.20 0.04 65720 13801.2 NASD LEAP 7.79 3.08% 12100 97163 Optimer Pharmaceuticals Inc. 15.39% OTC MNTR.PK MENTOR -o.18 -2.39% 8.48 2.25 507076.5 OTC NGEN.PK 0.01 84200 4210 ViaSat Inc. -2.44 NASD NAil NATURAL ALTERNATIVES 0.06 0.80% 7.99 33840 738727.2 Top Percentage Losers OTC PTSC.OB CORP. 0.16 -0.02 -12.50% 0.42 0.07 410300 57442 AMEX 8170 4902 Dalrada Financial -0.16 0.03 -o.01 -33.33% 0.04 0.01 3480 69.6 Unchanged 6 1N. w .sdbt com SAN DIEGO BUSINESS JOURNAl January 25, 2010 R lity Ch ngers Gives Scholarships to 2 High School Seniors hang r KUDOS/GIVING lorn: (J/u:tr Da'rell Andrews, left, shown with San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders , has earned a $20,000 college scholarship . 91X ...

Even in the depths of the Great Depression, businesses were not COMMENTARY saddled with the Bob Campbell quagmire of govern- ment regulations and tax mazes that exist now. In the best of times, the \"natural\" forces of capitalism are difficult enough to cope with. Free market forces of ever\u00ad shifting customer demands, evaporating profitability, and voracious competition are naturally ever present. There is constant upward pressure from salary expenses and other operat\u00ad ing costs, while competitors strive daily to steal your customers and, frankly, put you out of business. But, these are far from \"the best of times\" and there are numerous \"un\u00ad natural\" and unpredictable forces, e.g., increasing governmental regulation and taxation, adversely affecting business success. Future increased tax burdens are unknown , but threatening. And no one expects government to offer much mean\u00ad ingful help. Some have posited that the business climate in California is the worst in the nation, as businesses both fail and leave the state in record numbers. And frankly, \"as Rome burns,\" governrnent appears unwilling and unable to do anything to help preserve the free market economy , enhance the productive power of capital\u00ad ism, or help save the small-to medium\u00ad sized businesses that built this state and this country- and made the USA's economic engine the envy of the world. While there is no realistic end in sight to our current economic status, now, more than ever, business owners need to ensure their companies are practicing the fundamenta ls of excellent manage\u00ad ment. Here are the top four areas where concentration is vital. Planning Is Crucial Plan, plan, plan ... then plan some more. \"Plan,\" although intimidating, is not a \"four-letter word.\" A company without an operationally useful business plan is a rudderless ship. A plan that sits on a shelf, is not referred to, is not shared with all employees, and hasn't been up\u00ad dated in awhile is worthless. Planning is a living process (for those companies that wish to live)! Great busi\u00ad nesses write, rewrite and refresh their business plans frequently- as often as quarterly, but at least annuaUy. And then they constantly track progress to their plan's objectives. A good business plan -delineating operating efficiency and marketing activ\u00ad ity -puts everyone on the same page. It is the foundation of focus. '80/20' Rule Intimately embrace the \"80/20\" rule. Do you personally know your top customers? Do you know the 20-or-so percent of your customers who create 80-or-so percent of your profits? When was the last time you spoke to them or visited their premises? And when was the last time you did something for them? Your competitors are trying to take these customers away from you. What are you doing now about that? Every CEO/owne r should keep a fresh contact list on their desktops of the firm's most-profitable customers. These custom\u00ad ers should be talked to, and met with, frequently. Strategize aggressively on how to keep your most valuable customers. Act Now Avoid indecision. Now is not the time for a \"wait and see\" attitude. Many businesses , in trou\u00ad bled times, adopt a 'deer-in-headlights \" posture. Business development activity is postponed. Strategies are deferred. But inaction in the marketplace fosters stagnation. It gives room for competitors to strike. It may sound counter-intui\u00ad tive, but it is really true that \"a wrong decision is better than no decision at all.\" Why so? At least a mistake allows for analysis and the discovery of what will succeed. Then, the aggressive implemen\u00ad tation of that discovered success strategy can often recover whatever loss was caused by \"the mistake\" and help the company thrive. Learn Your Strengths, Weaknesses Get to know your organization. No, really, get to know it deeply. Organizational assessment is not an academic exercise. Mr. Business Owner, how much do you really know about the strengths and weaknesses of your busi\u00ad ness? How do you find these out? What do you do about them? In battle (and that is what businesses are in right now), great generals match the strengths of their army against the weaknesses of the enemy. But to do that, you have to know the types, amounts and durations of those strengths in order to effectively use them. And you must eliminate or minimize your weaknesses. If you know how to do all four of these things, then do them now. And if you don't know how, retain profes\u00ad sional help. Your competition is planning to celebrate your demise. And in these times, only the best-managed companies will survive. Bob Campbell is the managing director for the San Diego region of Strategic Development Worldwide , an advisory firm specializing in organizational assessment and development. How Reflective Leadership Affects an Organization Have you reflected lately on what your leadership says about your organization? Perhaps you've found yourself saying some of the following statements : \"I don't under\u00ad stand what is happening in my company. \" \"Nobody is telling me the truth.\" \"Most of my managers are not meeting their goals.\" We hear these types of statements fre\u00ad quently when we are called in to \"fix the problem.\" Almost always there is a com\u00ad mon theme involving lack of clarity or ac\u00ad countability that is not obvious and may be disguised as something else. In fact, the solutions are often found in the necessary practice of upper management reflect- ing inward first to see what they need to change; and then those changes can work their way throughout the organization . We call it \"Mirror Management. \" Productive leaders hold up the mirror and shine it inward to the areas where they may be blindsided. We know that if we can figure out what the leader is doing to contribute to the problem- and work toward changing the leader's behavior -then we can solve the problem affect\u00ad ing the de~ired results. Case \u00b7study: The Printing Plant John Crawford , CEO of Standard Plastic Printing, had the walls of the office and plant covered with slogans espousing teamwork , listening, proac\u00ad tive planning and cooperation. He could not understand why things were not going well. As he walked us through his offices and plant, the only communica\u00ad tion he had with employees was when he barked orders. He bragged about how he stopped jobs that were running as sched\u00ad uled when a friend needed something in a hurry and continually told us how stupid his employees were. No surprises here about why things weren't going well. It is often easy to see what someone else is doing wrong by blaming others, being critical, being blind or being busy. When a leader is bothered by someone's lack of results or poor behavior, it is a sign they need to look inward first. When the leader doesn't know what is going on in their company , it is usu\u00ad ally because they are experiencing their own confusion, ambivalence or lack of interest. John Crawford, in the example above, was only looking outward. Orga\u00ad nizational clarity begins at the top. Get\u00ad ting clarity and accountability are both essential to finding lasting solutions. Seeking Accountability ... And Truth It is hard to keep a pulse on an orga\u00ad nization through accountab ility-based principles because it requires a complete commitment to the truth about reality. When issues about truth are concerned, no one wants to believe that they are being dishonest (or less than honest). Mter all, admission of this sort might be interpreted as doing something wrong. No one wants to do anything wrong; so, it is easier to find fault in others. In organizations where goals are not met, there is usually very little accountability on the part of the leader. There must be a com\u00ad plete willingness to hold people accountable for their results. Lack of accountability gives tacit approval for poor performance. Remembering to hold up the mirror when you first detect a problem will help you reflect to get clarity about the impact your leadership has had on the current results. Mter determ.iillng what specific changes you need to make to create dif\u00ad ferent results, you need to establish the accountability to be certain it will happen. This ongoing practice of mirror manage\u00ad ment that starts with reflecting on your leadership is the only way to effect change and achieve lasting results that reflect on your organization in a positive light.
