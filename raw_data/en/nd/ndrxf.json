Do you sometimes feel tired, lethargic and spiritless? How can Ayurveda help in a simple, practisable manner?Time is scarce and precious in today's world, and we seek solutions that are quick. While allopathic medicine tends to focus on the management of disease, the ancient study of dinacharya provides us with holistic knowledge of preventing disease and eliminating its root cause. Taking us through a day in the life of Ayurveda living, Dr Bhaswati Bhattacharya illustrates the core principles of Ayurveda and shows us how to incorporate these in our routine. She explains the logic behind the changes she recommends and how they benefit us. Informative and accessible, Everyday Ayurveda is the perfect lifestyle guide designed to maximize health, longevity and happiness the natural way. Praise for Everyday Ayurveda'Dr Bhaswati has written a book that will help resurrect the knowledge I grew up on, using scientific logic for modern scientists, and slokas for ancient scientists and observers.

Advani, founder publisher, The Business India Group'Bhaswati has preserved the Sanskrit from which dinacharya emanates.
