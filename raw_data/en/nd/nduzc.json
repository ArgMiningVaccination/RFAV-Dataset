It reports both the frequency and geographic distribution of the disease in Wales in 2019 and changes over time. It also explores the different surveillance and control measures used to control TB in cattle herds and the impact of the disease. The intended audience for this report are those involved in the eradication of TB in cattle, both nationally and locally. This includes, but is not limited to: farmers, veterinarians, policy makers and the scientific community. Data presented in these reports are derived from the same source as Defra's 'National Statistics' on the incidence and prevalence of TB in Great Britain , which include monthly statistical reports and other quarterly statistics on s pecific aspects of TB surveillance. Whilst the data source is the same, additional time has been spent by APHA removing duplication and correcting other transactional data errors before compiling the Wales TB report. As such, there may be some differences between the data presented in this report and the national statistics. Summary The following summary highlights the main findings described in each section . Overall , the data suggests that progress continues to be made in Wales to tackle bovine tuberculosi s (TB) through the comprehensive TB eradication program me introduced in 2008. A refreshed eradication strategy was published in 20171 to check progress towards a TB - free Wales and focus on a regionalised approach to TB control. The implementation of annual testing across all cattle herds in Wales since 2010 has continued to be effective in identifying infection early, with the number of new TB incidents at a ten year low. Six per cent of cattle herds had a new TB incident in 2019, while 5.5% were under move ment restrictions, with around 90 % of cattle herds in Wales free of TB. Where data has identified that TB incidence and prevalence are not uniformly distributed throughout Wales, the introduction of TB Risk Areas help to identify the different patterns of disease across the country. Welsh cattle population characteristics As in previous years, density of herds was highest in the High West TB Area. Beef herds accounted for nearly 80% of all herds in Wales, however the majority of large herds (with more than 300 animals) are dairy (74%). This is consistent with previous reporting years. 1 https://gov.wales/sites/default/files/publications/2017 -11/wales -bovine -tb-eradication -programme.pdf Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 11 Routine testing frequency has remained stable since the implementation of annual testing, and the ratio of animal tests to cattle is 2:1. Most animal movements occur within t he same TB Area, although the percentage varies, from 29% in the Intermediate North TB Area to 80% in the High West TB Area. The High West, Intermediate Mid and Intermediate North TB Areas received more animal movements from higher risk areas, and movement s that occurred outside of the same TB Area. Bovine tuberculosis surveillance in Wales Just over two million skin tests were conducted in Wales in 2019 across all TB areas. Nearly 70% of all tests were conducted in the High TB Areas of Wales. 'Routine' a nd 'Herd Risk' tests detected similar numbers of herds where the officially tuberculosis free (OTF) status was withdrawn ( OTF-W, 106 and 111, respectively), and more than double were detected by 'Area Risk' tests. However, as a proportion of all tests, ove r five times as many incidents were detected per 100 'Herd Risk' tests and over three times as many incidents per 100 'Area Risk' tests compared to 'Routine' herd tests. Reactor and Inconclusive Reactor (IR) frequencies were greatest in the High West TB A rea, reflecting the geographical distribution of TB incidents in Wales. The median number of reactors disclosed at the first whole herd test (WHT) following an incident is usually one or two in each TB Area but was higher in the High West TB Area (3). Interferon gamma (IFN -) tests are used in less heavily infected areas of Wales to help prevent TB from becoming established in low incidence areas, and in areas where TB is more prevalent, the use of IFN - helps to clear infection from herds more quickly. In 2019, 5% of all IFN - tests in the High East and West TB Areas disclosed reactors. This was slightly higher in the Intermediate Mid TB Area (7%) and lower in the Intermediate North and Low TB Areas (3%). Bovine tuberculosis incidence in Wales In 2019, the number of new TB incidents had declined by 11% comp ared to 2018 and was the lowest number since 2006 . A total of 661 new TB incidents were disclosed in 2019, the majority (91%) of which were OTF -W. Where the number of new TB incidents disclosed each year has been declining over the past ten years, the TB incidence (number of newly detected infected herd per 100 active herds) and incidence rate (number of new TB incidents per 100 herd years at risk ( HYR )) has also declined. Nearly 6% of herds incurred a ne w TB incident in 2019, and nearly 7% per 100 HYR. As expected, incidence rates were highest in the High East and West TB Areas which were above the overall average for Wales. All TB Areas apart from the Intermediate North, experienced a decline in incidenc e per 100 HYR in 2019. Incidence in the Intermediate North TB Area has varied over time but in recent years has been close to or above the average for Wales, as was the case in 2019. Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 12 The risk of a herd becoming infected with TB is associated with factors such as herd density, herd size, production type, TB history and location. These factors contribute to the spatial pattern of TB in cattle herds across Wales. Dairy herds had a signifi cantly higher TB incidence rate compared to beef herds, however this effect did not remain once adjusting for herd size and location. As well as systematic skin testing of cattle, routine slaughterhouse surveillance is also used to identify and remove in fected animals. Just under 10% of new OTF -W incidents in 2019 were disclosed in the slaughterhouse, but this varied by TB Area, with the Intermediate Mid TB Area closer to 20% and the Low TB Area at 3%. Dairy herds and herds with 11 -200 animals had signi ficantly lower odds of incurring an OTF -W incident that was disclosed in the slaughterhouse, compared to beef herds or herds with more than 300 animals. This effect remained after controlling for other factors (herd size, herd type and TB Area). After controlling for herd size and type, the odds of an OTF -W incident being disclosed in the slaughterhouse was nearly three times higher in the Intermediate Mid TB Area, compared to the High West TB Area. This could be as a result of either , variation in the sens itivity of slaughterhouse surveillance by TB Area, or geographic clustering of Official Veterinarian (OV) surveillance test performance issues. Sixteen per cent of herds with new TB incidents in 2019 had suffered another TB incident in the previous three y ears, confirming that recurrent infection remains an important driver for TB infection in Wales. The odds of a herd incurring a recurrent TB infection was twice as high in herds with TB history in the High West and Intermediate North TB Areas and over thre e times greater in the Intermediate Mid TB Area (compared to herds with no TB history in the previous 36 months) . Beef herds with TB history were also twice as likely to have a TB incident in 2019 compared to herds with no TB history. Some animals show re actions to the skin test that are not marked enough to be classed as a reactor. Inconclusive reactors (IRs) were found in 715 herds in Wales, and 17% of these IR-only herds (that were clear at retest), went on to have a TB incident in the subsequent 15 mon ths, compared to 5% (482/8,946) of non -IR herds that tested clear at a routine whole herd test. Half of all IR -only animals that had tested clear at the first retest, remained clear in the subsequent 15 month follow -up. Bovine tuberculosis prevalence in Wales Application of movement restrictions helps to prevent infection spreading, and reduce s the risk of TB persisting in cattle herds. In 2019, 6% of Welsh herds incurred a new TB incident and 5.5% of herds were under movement restrictions (in mid -Decembe r 2019, excluding herds under restriction due to an overdue test). As expected, prevalence varied by TB Area, and with over half of TB incidents in 2019 located in the High West TB Area, prevalence was highest here too (11%). In recent years, prevalence h as peaked on an approximate three -yearly basis . This could be associated with the high risk of recurrence of infection in herds and the frequency by which herds were tested in relation to TB risk before annual testing was introduced (where herds from Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 13 low incidence areas were tested on a less frequent basis). The percentage of herds under movement restrictions has remained relatively stable at around 5% since annual testing was implemented in 201 0. When comparing the prevalence of TB by risk area in Wales, the percentage of herds under movement restrictions (per 100 live herds) is greater in the High East and West TB Areas compared to Wales overall. In the Intermediate North TB Area, prevalence has increased since 2016. Prevalence in the Intermediate Mid and Low TB Areas fluctuates but remains below the average for Wales. The median duration of OTF -W incidents has remained relatively stable over the past ten years, averaging 240 days , or eight months . Persistent TB herds refer to herds that have been under mo vement restrictions for 550 days or more (or over 18 months). Persistent OTF-W incidents tended to be clustered in the High TB Areas in the West and East, affecting South West Wales and in counties along the border with the high risk area of England. There were a total of 135 persistent open incidents in 2019, with 67% located in the High West TB Area. A total of 39 TB incidents that closed in 2019 were classed as persistent . Post mortem examination, culture and genotyping of suspected TB cases The number of cattle slaughtered for TB control has shown an increasing trend over the past five years. The recent increase in the number of reactors disclosed is primarily attributable to increases in IFN - testing. A total of 12,599 cattle were slaughtered in 2019 for TB control. Of these, 68% were r eactors to either the skin test, IFN- or antibody test 25% were IRs and 7% were D irect Contact s (DCs). In 2019, nearly 30% of reactors disclosed in Wales through standard interpretation of the skin test were confirmed i nfected, through either observation of detectable lesions (DLs) or culture of M bovis . The percentage was higher in the High East TB Area compared to Wales overall (46%) , but lower in all other TB Areas (between 23 -25%) . The percentage of samples with DLs that were M. bovis positive varied by TB Area and was highest in the High East TB Area (96%) and lowest in the Low TB Area (67%). Of the 2,115 samples from animals with no detectable lesions (NDLs) and for which culture results were available, 1.3% were M. bovis positive overall. The percentage positive was highest in the High East and Low TB Areas (2.3 and 3.4% respectively). There were 377 isolates from cattle for incidents in Wales that started in 2019 . All were spoligotyped and the full genotype (spolig otype plus 6 VNTR loci) was obtained for 95% of these . The most common spoligotype in Wales is spoligotype 9, which has two main clusters, one in the south -west (High West TB Area) and the other mainly located in Mid Powys (High East TB Area).

The primary purpose of these reports is to provide important information about the bovine tuberculosis epidemic in Wales. This report focuses on the period January to December 201 9 but, where it is useful to do so, the report includes historical data. Like those before it, this report is designed to be a principal resource to those people directly involved in making policy decisions about the bovine tuberculosis eradication programm e in Wales. The epidemiology of bovine tuberculosis is complex and in order to be fit for its primary purpose the report contains complex technical information that some may find inaccessible. Notwithstanding this it is published in the hope that others wi ll find its content informative and useful. A summary is provided and much of the information contained here will form the basis for other publications aimed at different audiences. It is inevitable and entirely appropriate that the format and content of t he reports in this series will evolve over time. The challenge will be to do so while remaining true to the primary purpose and maintaining a consistent narrative of the bovine tuberculosis epidemic in Wales. The considerable effort that colleagues in the APHA have put into producing this valuable and informative report is greatly appreciated. Office of the Chief Veterinary Officer Welsh Government March 2021 Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 18 1.0 Welsh cattle population characteristics and cattle movements Key Points: As in previous years, density of herds was highest in the High West TB Area. The High East and Low TB Area have the same percentage of total herds in Wales, however in the Low TB Area, herds are particularly concentrated in Anglesey. Beef herds accounted for nearly 80% of all herds in Wales, however the majority of large herds (with more than 300 animals) are dairy (74%) , which is consistent with previous reporting years. The number of animal tests conducted in a reporting year has remained fairly stable over the past five years , as has the ratio of animal -level tests to cattle (2:1), reflecting the stability in the routine testing frequency. Although most animal s moved in Wales stay within the same TB Area, the percentage varies, from 29% in the Intermed iate North TB Area, to 80% in the High West TB Area. The areas of Wales that received more animal movements from higher risk areas, and outside the same TB Area included the High West, Intermediate Mid and Intermediate North TB Areas. When comparing the previous three years, there is little variation in the percentage of movements from different areas into each Welsh TB risk area, however the percentage s of movements from different areas differ strongly between the Welsh TB risk areas. This section describes the population demographics of cattle in Wales , and cattle movements into each TB Area in Wales . It includes a description of factors which can affect TB infection risk such as herd size and production type . A summary of the number o f TB tests performed is also provided , although further information on testing is presented in Section 2 . Monitoring the movement of cattle is an important tool in TB surveillance. Movements from a high incidence area into a lower incidence area could increase the likelihood of a herd becoming infected , although the use of pre -and post -movement testing will mitigate some of this risk . The Wales TB eradication programme that launched on 1 October 2017 has a regionalised approach . This regionalised approach introduced Low, Intermediate and High TB Areas where measures have been applied in each TB Area , tailored to address the varying risks and disease drivers in each TB Area. 1.1Welsh cattle population characteristics The density of cattle herds registered as active on SAM on the 31st December 201 9 in Wales and the bordering English counties is shown in Figure 1.1 (see Appendix 5 for description of areas). Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 19 The geographical distribution is consistent with previous years. The High West TB Area (comprising Pembrokeshire, West Carmarthenshire, South West Ceredigion and the Gower) had the largest number of herds (3,185; 27% of total). The High East TB Area (comprising North East, Mid and South Powys and Gwent) had a similar number of herds to the Low TB Area (2,8 06 and 2,8 26 respectively, both 24% of the total ). This was a slight decrease on the number of herds observed in 2018 . Large areas of low herd density (<0.2 7 herds per km2) exist across the central/western mountainous section of Wales; from mainland Gwynedd in the North to the Glamorgans in the South (Figure 1.1 .1). Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 20 Figure 1.1 .1: Density of cattle herds in Wales and English border counties, 201 9 Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 21 Beef herds formed the majority (77%) of cattle herds in Wales whilst dairy and mixed/other herds accounted for 20% and 3%, respectively . Variation s in these percentage s exist between TB Areas . The High East, Intermediate North and Low TB Areas had around 83 - 85% beef herds, whilst the percentage in the High West (64%) and Intermediate North (68%) were slightly lower where more dairy herds were present (34% and 28 % respectively; Table 1.1.1a). In the High West TB Area, there are more than three times the number of dairy herds (1,069) compared to a ny other TB Area in Wales (around 300 herds in each TB Area) . This reflects the large number of cattle in these dairy herds compared to other TB Areas (Table 1.1.1b) . The High East and Low TB Areas have a similar number of beef herds (close to 2,400), whil e the High West and Intermediate Mid TB Areas have around 2,000 herds. The Intermediate Mid TB Area has just 625 beef herds, which reflects the smaller geographical area it represents across Wales.

Herds in the High West TB Area tended to be larger , with 12 % having more than 300 cattle. Despite making up the majority of the total number of herds in Wales, beef herds are typically smaller than dairy cattle enterprises. Around 80% of beef herds had 100 animals or fewer compared with only 33% of dairy h erds (Table 1.1 .1c and d).

They are mainly herds that do not have cattle shown on CTS or no link on the CPH, hence are not tested. Many of these are listed as 'temporary gatherings' on SAM and are therefore not typical cattle farms.

In the same period, the total number of cattle decreased by 1.3%. In 2014, a cleansing exercise was performed on BCMS data, resulting in the removal of inactive herds, and a subsequent decline in the total number of herds recorded on the database in 2015. The increase observed i n 2017 could be as a result of policy changes, for example where TB isolation units require a separate and unique CPH, thus lifting the number of herds recorded . The total number of tests conducted on cattle in Wales increas ed by only 0.1% (3,810 tests) between 2018 and 2019 . In 201 9, the total number of annual tests conducted on cattle in Wales included approximately 238 ,000 cattle that were slaughtered by the meat industry and underwent routine inspection for the presence of lesions indicative of M. bovis infection. The ratio of animal -level tests to the number of cattle has remained fairly static, 2:1 between 2015 and 2019 (Table 1. 1.2). Following the results of the TB Health Check Wales in 2008, all herds in Wales have been tested annually since January 2010 . However, approximately 300 herds in the Intensive Action Area (IAA) of Pembrokeshire have been tested biannually since May 2010. As well as more frequent routine testing, measures imposed to reduce infection levels include: enhanced cattle movement controls, improved biosecurity measures on farms, testing of goats and camelids and badger vaccination. This regime has continued since the refreshed TB eradication programme was launched on 1 October 2017.

Numbers of routinely slaughtered cattle (derived fro m CTS) are included because every carcase undergoes inspection for macroscopic lesions that could indicate TB. 1.2Cattle movements - number of movements by TB Area Cattle movements within and between TB risk areas, can increase the risk of herds becoming infected, especially if movements into a herd are from herds at higher risk. Table 1. 2.1 shows the total number (and percentage) of movements across all GB areas, to each TB Area in Wales. In 2019, the majority of animal moves occurred from herds located within the same TB Area, but the percentage varied . The highest number of animal movements was in the Low TB Area, followed by the High West TB Area, although 80% of movements were from within the same TB Area. There was a higher percentage of animal movements from England's H igh Risk Area (H RA) and Edge Area, into the High West TB Area (27%) and the Intermediate North TB Area (44%) compared to other TB Areas. Even in the Low TB Area, where 80% of movements occurred within the same TB Area, nearly 7% w ere from the HRA and Edge areas of England which accounted for over 6,000 animals. Most infection in the Low TB Area is likely to be as a result of undetected infection brought in by cattle movement. Therefore, as of 1 October 2017, all cattle moved into t he Low TB Area require a post -movement test. In herds in the High East TB Area , 44% of animal movements were from herds within the same TB A rea, with a further 23% from England's Edge area. By contrast, in the Intermediate Mid TB Area , 46% were from within the same area, and 32% from the High West TB Area . This highlights there are a significant number of animal movements into lower risk areas in Wales, from higher risk areas of both Wales and England. Herds in t he Intermediate North TB Area received broadl y similar percentage s of cattle from a number Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 25 of TB Areas (30% from within the same TB Area), with 44% of movements from England's HRA and Edge Area. Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 26 Table 1.2.1: Number and percentage of animal movements from GB areas to each Welsh TB Area , 2019 Number of animal moves in 2019 Welsh TB Area Moved To : GB TB Area Moved From: Wales: High East Wales: High West Wales: Intermediate North 0-10% 11-30% 31-50% 51-70% 71-100% Figure 1.2 .1 shows the percentage of total movements from each GB Area into herds in each Welsh TB Area, from 2017 to 2019. Overall, there is not much variation in the percentage of movements from different areas into each Welsh TB risk area when comparing the last three years . However, the percentage s of mov ements from different areas differ strongly between the Welsh TB Areas. The High East and Intermediate North TB Areas had more movements from England risk areas, likely due to their location bordering with England counties .

At standard interpretation, 0.2% of skin tests disclosed reactors in the High East TB Area, 0.15% in the High West, 0.1 % in the Intermediate North and Mid Areas and 0.01% in the Low TB Area. In 2019, 5% of all IFN- tests in the High East and West TB Areas disclosed reactors. The percentage was slightly higher in the Intermediate Mid TB Area (7%) and lower in the Intermediate North and Low TB Areas (3%). In 2019, there were 661 new TB incidents, of which 604 (91%) were classified as OTF-W and 57 (9%) as OTF -S. As a proportion of all tests, ov er five times as many incidents were detected per 100 'Herd Risk' tests and over three times as many incidents per 100 'Area Risk' tests compared to 'Routine' herd tests. Reactor and Inconclusive Reactor ( IR) frequencies w ere greatest in the High West TB Area, reflecting the geographical distribution of TB incidents in Wales. The median number of reactors disclosed at the first whole herd test (WHT) following a TB incident , is usually one or two in each TB Area . In the High West TB Area, the median number of reactors from risk -based skin testing was three. There were a small number of incidents with unusually large number s of reactors. In the High West TB Area, the mean number of reactors disclosed through risk-based and routine testing was 4.8 and 2.7, res pectively. The mean number of reactors from incidents disclosed through slaughterhouse surveillance was highest in the Intermediate Mid TB Area (3.5). Skin testing is a k ey component of TB surveillance . Additionally, enhanced testing occurs in response to specific risks, for example, herds that are contiguous to infected herds. Surveillance effort varies according to the perceived risk of infection , which can be gauged by the number of tests conducted p er herd , animal or other subsets (e.g. herd size, type, farm management, and neighbouring herds ). 2.1 Numbers of tests (skin, interferon gamma and antibody) and reactors over time The vast majority of tests carried out in Wales for the surveillance of TB i n cattle are skin tests. Just over two million skin and IFN- tests were conducted in Wales in 2019 across all TB Areas. Nearly 70% of all tests were conducted in the High TB Areas of Wales (21% in the High East and 46% in the High West). Less than 0.5% o f skin tests (by standard interpretation) disclose reactors. Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 29 Table 2.1.1 shows the number of SICCT, IFN- and antibody tests carried out in each TB Area between 2010 and 2019, along with the number of reactors (standard and severe for SICCT), detected les ions (DL) and Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis). The number of skin tests increased in the High West, Intermediate Mid and Intermediate North TB Areas in 2019 compared to 2018, but showed a slight decline in the High East and Low TB Areas. The number of reactors disclosed in 2019 (by standard interpretation of the skin test) increased slightly in the Intermediate Mid and North TB Areas, and decline d in the High East, High West and Low TB Areas. By severe interpretation of the skin test, the number of reactors increased in the High West and Intermediate North TB Area s, stayed the same in the Intermediate Mid TB Area and decreased in the High East and Low TB Areas. Apart from the Low TB Area, the number of IFN- tests carried out in each TB Area has increased over time, with the majority being carried out in the High TB West Area (36,366 tests in 2019). The number of reactors disclosed by IFN- tests h as mostly increased over time, although there was a sligh t decrease in 2019 in the High East, Intermediate Mid and Low TB Areas. Very few antibody tests have been carried out since 2010 (most reported in the last two years), resulting in only two M. bovis positives from DL reactors in the High East TB Area in 2018 , and one in the Low TB Area in 2019.

The number of 2xIRs were highest in the High We st TB Area (196). The percentage of 2xIRs wit h DL was highest in the Intermediate Mid TB Area, although this was based on only four DL animals (two were from slaughterhouse disclosed incidents, one from WHT and one from a contiguous test (CON12) . The number of 3xIRs2 was high est in the High West TB Area (108). Only three 3xIRs had DLs, one each in the High West, High East and Intermediate Mid TB Areas. There were no M. bovis positive animals from 3xIR DLs (one in 2018 in the High West TB Area) . More DCs were identified in 2019 compared to 2xIRs and 3xIRs, but few had DLs and only 13 of these were positive for M. bovis . None were identified in the Low TB Area. 2 Animals having two successive tests giving inconclusive reactor measurements are generally considered to be skin test reactors, but may be described as \"IRs After 2 [or more] tests as IR\" to distinguish them from other reactors in some parts of this report.

Similar numbers of OTF - W incidents were detected by 'Routine' and 'Herd Risk' test types (Table 2.2 .1), whilst more than double were detected by 'Area Risk' tests (see Appendix 3 for test type category details). However, when c onsidered as a proportion of all tests, over five times as many incidents were detected per 100 'Herd Risk' tests and over three times as many incidents per 100 'Area Risk' tests tha n through 'Routine' herd tests. The higher detection of TB incidents from 'area and herd risk' tests is expected , given that these tests are conducted in areas where herds and cattle are perceived to be at increased risk of infection.

Historically, approximately 30% of new TB incidents were detected through 'Routine' testing but over the last five years has reduced to around 20% (Figure 2.2.1) . This is due to the falling number of incidents overall, and an increasing proportion of TB incidents being detected through 'Area Risk' tests carried out. Between 34% and 42% of annual TB incidents have been detected through 'Area Risk' tests since 2011 . The number of TB incidents detected through slaughterhouse surveillance has varied over the past five years, but the proportion has increased in 2018 and 2019.

The application of short interval tests during TB incidents means that animals were tested more frequently in areas with higher l evels of TB . In addition, parts of Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion (all in the High West TB Area) were subject to six monthly testing as part of the Intensive Action Area strategy.

This type of surveillance can detect some infected cattle that may be missed by active live animal surveillance. Slaughterhouse surveillance can act as an indicator for the efficacy of the live animal testing component of the surveillance system , where an increase in cases detected at slaughter may reflect infection not bei ng picked up in active surveillance (when carried out optimally by experienced and trained official veterinarians) . Equally, a decrease in slaughterhouse cases may indicate where TB infection is being detected earlier on the farm, due to enhanced surveilla nce and control measures. Monitoring trends in the percentage of TB incidents disclosed at the slaughterhouse can therefore identify changes which may warrant further investigation. Routine slaughterhouse surveillance identifies animals with TB -like lesi ons from a population that are not being sent to slaugh ter as reactors on the basis of a positive field test result (skin test) or IFN- test. As such, to increase the specificity of routine slaughterhouse surveillance, M. bovis must be isolated from suspe ct lesions by laboratory culture before TB infection can be confirmed. The number of sl aughterhouse samples submitted between 2015 and 2019 from cattle originating from Welsh herds and their culture results are presented in Table 2.4.1. There were sharp d eclines in the number of submissions made in 2016 and 2019. Any d ecline in slaughterhouse detection of TB -like lesions could be due to infected cattle being detected earlier by more frequent TB field testing and more sensitive testing regimes for herds sustaining TB incidents , or on the other hand could be due to poorer sensitivity of slaughterhouse post -mortems . The percentage of samples submitted from slaughterhouses (from cattle with TB -like lesions detected during this surveillance), which were positive for M. bovis was 60.4% in 2019, which is consistent with 2017 and 2018 despite some variation over the past five years. The percentage in 2016 was the lowest Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 40 observed in the last five years (52%). The percentage for Great Britain as a whole in 2019 was 64.1%3.

The culture results of samples processed in 2019, split by TB Area are shown in Table 2.4.2. The largest percentages of M. bovis positive submissions came from animals originating from herds in the Intermediate Mid, High East and High West TB Areas ( 71%, 69% and 6 2% respectively). The higher percentage could indicate reduced sensitivity of skin te sting in some TB Areas (see Table 3.6.1) .

Tables 2.5.1 a-e show the median and mean number of reactors identified at the first WHT for incidents identified at slaughterhouse an d via skin testing (routine and risk -based) in 2019, split by TB Area. The merit in considering the first WHT , rather than the entire incident, is that some incidents detected in 2019 may still have been open at the end of the year. This can give an indic ation of the severity of the incidents which began in 2019. The mean (average) number of reactors is higher than the median , which reflects the positively skewed distribution of reactors. Most incidents result in only one or two reactors, so the median is low, but there are a minority of incidents with much larger numbers of reactors, thus pulling the mean upwards. An increase in the median number of reactors from a slaughterhouse incident could be an indicator of built-up or undetected infectio n in the her d, potentially reflecting a reduction in the effectiveness of skin testing, or can be a reflection of the inspection efficacy by official veterinarians . Overall, the median number of reactors disclosed through all surveillance (skin testing and slaughterh ouse surveillance) was one for the High East, Intermediate Mid and Low TB Areas, and two for the High West and Intermediate North TB Areas. For slaughterhouse inspection , the median was zero for all TB Areas bar the Intermediate North (one) . For risk - based skin testing, the median was three in the High West, two in the Intermediate Mid and North TB Areas and one in the High East and Low TB Areas. For routine skin testing, the median number of reactors disclosed for all TB was two in the High West TB Area an d one for all other TB Areas, although increasing to two in the Intermediate Mid and North Areas when looking at the median of just OTF -W incidents (Table 2.5.1). The mean number of reactors disclosed through slaughterhouse surveillance was highest in the Intermediate Mid TB Area (n=3.5; based on 11 TB incidents, all OTF -W). For routine and risk -based skin testing, the mean was highest in the High West TB Area (n=2.7 and 4.8 respectively).

The mean number of reactors identified from total TB incidents was highest in the Intermediate Mid TB Area for slaughterhouse inspection (23.8) and highest in the H igh West TB Area for risk-based skin testing and slaughterhouse inspection (10.9 and 11.5 , respectively). The median number of reactors identified in closed incidents was around one or two for routine skin testin g, being slightly higher for risk -based skin testing (four in the High West and six in the Intermediate North and Low TB Area).

This includes the disclosing test, but only the following first check test if the disclosing test is not a whole herd test, for example an IR retest or pre -movement test. Generally , the trends observed in the median number of reactors mirror the trends in the mean, albeit at a lower level. In 2019, the median number of reactors identified per incident at the first herd test after slaughterhouse inspection was zero, having fluctuat ed between zero and one since 2010. The median number of reactors for incidents disclosed by routine skin testing had fluctuated between one and two since 2010 , increasing to three in 2017 before returning down to two in 2018 and 2019. Increased use of severe interpretation may have led to this short -term increase in the median number of reactors. Severe interpretation is used in TB infected herds with lesion and/or culture positive animals and in herds with increased risk of infection, for example any in which more than one reactor has been found Over the past ten years, trends in the mean number of reactors at the first WHT indicate that there has been little difference in the mean number of reactors found in TB incidents disclosed through slaughterhouse cases and those disclosed through skin testing. This applies when looking at Wales overall but as Tables 2.5.1 (a -e) demonstrate, there is more variation when looking at the data by TB Area. The temporal trends in the mean and median total number of reactors disclosed per closed TB incident are presented in Figure 2.5.2. The median number of reactors per skin -test disclosed incident rema ined relatively constant between 2010 and 2015, typically around two, although this increased to three in 2016 and has remained at that value since . The median number disclosed in per slaughterhouse incident has fluctuated between one and two reactors betw een 2010 and 2018 and then increased to three in 2019. The mean number of reactors in skin-test disclosed incident s has fluctuated over time with peaks in 2013 (nearly ten per incident), 2016 and 2017 (nine per incident, respectively). A similar trend can also be seen for slaughterhouse disclosed incidents, although there is more fluctuation , in part due to the relatively small number of slaughterhouse cases.

This number differs to Defra's official statistics due to different data cleansing processes (detailed in Appendix 1). Incidence rates for total TB also decreased by 11% in Wales overall, from 7.5 TB incidents per 100 herd years at risk in 2018, to 6.7 in 2019. There was variation by TB Area, with all apart from the Intermediate North TB Area experiencing a decline in the incidence rate in 2019. Dairy herds had a significantly higher TB incidence rate compared to beef herds, however this effect did not remain once adjusting for herd size and location. Just under 10% of new OTF -W incidents in 2019 were disclosed in the slaughterhouse. After controlling for the effects of herd size and location, dairy herds had significantly lower odds of an OTF -W incident being disclosed in the slaughterhouse, compared to beef herds. After controlling for the effects of herd type and location, h erd sizes of 11 -200 animals had reduced odds of having an OTF -W incident being disclosed in the slaughterhouse, compared to herds with more than 300 animals. After controlling for the effects of herd size and production type, the odds of an OTF - W incident being dis closed in the slaughterhouse was nearly three times higher in the Intermediate Mid TB Area, compared to the High West TB Area. This could be as a result of differences in the sensitivity of slaughterhouse surveillance by TB Area, or from geographic cluster ing of Official Veterinarian (OV) surveillance test performance issues. Sixteen per cent of herds (260/ 1,586 ) with a TB incident in the previous 36 months, had a new (recurrent) TB incident in 2019 . Herds with a recurrent OTF-W incident in 2019 were significantly more likely to have been restricted due to a previous OTF-W incident , compared with herds that had a new OTF -S incident in 2019 in all TB Areas. Beef herds with TB history were twice as likely to have a TB incident in 2019 compared to herds with no TB history (for dairy herds, the odds ratio, or OR=1.6) The odds of a herd incurring a new TB incident in 2019 was twice as high in herds with TB history in the High West and Intermediate North and over three times greater in the Intermediate Mid TB Area. 17% (116/715) of IR -only herds that were clear at retest, went on to have a TB incident in the subsequent 15 months, compared to 5% (482/8,946) of non -IR herds that tested clear at a routine whole herd test. 51% (1,183/2,298) of IR -only animals th at had tested clear at the first retest, remained clear in the subsequent 15 month follow -up. Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 50 3.1Summary of new TB incidents in Wales There were 661 new TB incidents in Wales in 2019, which represents an 11.2% decrease compared to 2018. The High West and East TB Areas had the highest number of new incidents (308 and 210 respectively) , equating to nearly 80% of the total for Wales (Table 3.1.1 ). The number of OTF -S incidents continues to decline at a higher rate than OTF -W in Wales overall, particularly sin ce 2011 when many OTF -S incidents were reclassified as OTF-W.

In the High East TB Area, the total number of new TB incidents has f allen from around 300 in 2013 (following the implementation of annual testing across Wales), to 210 in 2019. The High West TB Area has shown a similar decreasing trend but from around 400 in 2013 to 308 in 2019. The Intermediate Mid and North TB Areas hav e had similar number of TB incidents since 2012.

Annual trends in the total number of new TB incidents by TB Area, 2010 -2019 Figure 3.1.2 shows the geographical distribution of new OTF -W and OTF -S incidents in 2019. There has been little c hange in the geographical distribution of new TB incidents over the past five years ( see Figure 2.4, 2018 publication1). As shown in Table 3.1.1, most new TB incidents are located in the High West and East TB Areas. New TB incidents were detected in every TB Area in Wales during 2019, however, as observed historically, the majority of incidents were found in the south west and along the English/Welsh border. Larger numbers of new incidents are typically detected in areas with higher cattle herd density, ho wever, the cattle population distribution does not entirely account for variation in the number of new incidents detected in each TB Area (Figure 1.1.1).

The variation in TB incidence between different geographical areas, herd sizes and herd types is described to facilitate the development of targeted surveillance strategies. The methods used to determine incidence of TB in Welsh cattle herds are described in detail in Appendix 1, and summarised here: Incidence of TB - this is expressed as the number of newly detected infected herds during 2019, per 100 active herds tested by whole herd test when not under movement restrictions and therefore at risk of having a new incident. Incidence rate - this is calculated by divi ding the number of new incidents by the total amount of time the herds tested during the period in question were unrestricted and at risk of infection since the end of their last TB incident or negative herd test (described as 'herd -years at risk' , or HYR ). This is an established method for disease incidence estimation, and provides a more reliable time series as it accounts for changes in regional testing frequency over time. In 2019, TB incidence was 5.6%, therefore nearly six herds per 100 live herds incurred a new TB incident . TB i ncidence varied by TB Area, being highest in the High West TB Area (9.7 TB incidents per 100 live herds) and in contrast less than one TB incident being disclosed per 100 live herds in the Low TB Area (Table 3.2.1). The incidence rate was 6.7 new TB incidents per 100 HYR . This is equivalent to detecting 67 new incidents for every 1,000 herds that had been unrestricted for one year and is a n 11% decrease compared to 2017 (7.5 per 100 HYR ). As expected, incidence rates were highest in the High West and East TB Areas.

The difference in incidence between OTF-W and total TB incidents has continua lly narrowed since 2011 due to the change in classification of OTF -W1 incidents and the subse quent increase in the number of all incidents classified as OTF -W. 1 Throughout this report the OTF -W cohort contains incidents without post mortem evidence of infection that have been determined to have suff icient epidemiological evidence to withdraw OTF status (OTF -W-2; see Materials and Methods section for more information).

Generally, the temporal trends in incidence per 100 live herds and incidence rate per 100 HYR are similar, with a general decline since 2013. OTF -W incidents are under movement restrictions for longer periods compared to OTF-S incidents as they require a second clear short -interval test (SIT) before movement restrictions can be lifted. Also, as ne w OTF -W incidents in the Low and Intermediate North TB Areas have been subject to mandatory herd IFN- tests, this could lead to prolonged movement restrictions if additional reactors are disclosed. There is an increase in sensitivity of testing in persist ent TB incidents, meaning more incidents may be classed as persistent, as fewer herds are coming off movement restrictions. As expected, OTF -S incidence has declined over time, particularly since 2011, as an artefact of OTF -S incidents being reclassified as OTF -W.

There is a general declining pattern in TB incidence within all TB Areas, albeit with cyclical peaks and troughs, but the trend is more ev ident in the High East and West TB Areas where incidence is highest. Despite a decrease through 2018 and 2019, the incidence rate in the Intermediate North TB Area increased again in the last quarter of the year, compared to all other TB A reas, where decre ases in incidence rates were observed over the year.

The grey dotted line represents the overall trend in Wales 3.4Inciden ce of TB across Wales A number of factors are associated with the risk of a herd becoming infected with TB , including local herd densit y, herd size and type, TB history and location. Herd size and the local density of herds are closely associated with the risk for herd s to become infected with TB. These factors contribute to the spatial pattern of TB infection in Welsh cattle herds (Figure 3.4.1). High cattle density and herd incidence is fo und in the High (West and East) and parts of the Intermediate Mid and North TB Areas. The sparsest population in terms of both cattle density (Figure 1.1.1) and herd incidence is in the Low TB Area and across the mountainous ranges of Wales (Snowdonia in the Low TB Area and the Cambrian Mountains and Brecon Beacons lying between the Intermediate Mid and High East TB Areas). Cattle demographics alone cannot explain the distribution of TB, as cattle density is high in parts of the Low TB Area, and the West of the Intermediate North TB Area, but TB incidence is low. Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 59 Figure 3.4.1 Herd level incidence of TB in Wales in 2019. Herd incidence is the average incidence in the 100 closest herds to each herd location which 'smooths' the effect of political boundaries Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 60 3.5Variation in TB incidence by herd type, herd size and geograph ical area Table 3.5.1 shows the results of a Poisson regression analysis (see Appendix 1 for details on methods used) of TB incidence rates by TB Area, herd type and herd size. The results from the Poisson regression indicate that TB incidence rates increase with herd size . This effect remains after adjusting for the influence of herd type and TB Area, and has been observed consistently for the past five years. Dairy herds had a significantly higher incidence rate than beef herds (14.0 vs. 4.5 TB incidents per 100 HYR ). However, this effect did not remain once adjusting the analyses for herd size and location. This result is consistent with th at seen in 2014 but in subsequent years, the incidence rate ratio ( IRR) was significantly higher in dairy herds even after adjusting for herd size and TB Area. As expected, the IRR was significantly lower in the Low , Intermediate North and Mid TB Areas TB Area compared to th e High West TB Area where TB incidence per 100 HYR is much lower, even after adjusting for herd size and type . This effect does not occur in the High East TB Area as it has a similarly high TB incidence rate (per 100HYR).

This is a 15% decrease compared to 2018 but similar to 2015 , when 10% were disclosed in the slaughterhouse, and slightly higher than the percentage disclosed in 2016 and 2017 (7%) . The p ercentage varies widely by TB Area in Wales, being highest in the Inte rmediate Mid TB Area (19%) and lowest in the Intermediate North Area (3%) (Figure 3.6.1 ). In the High TB East and West Areas, the p ercentage of OTF -W incidents disclosed in the SLH has remained fairly stable over time at around 10%, but there is considerab ly more variation in the Intermediate and Low TB Areas. The number of incidents may be linked to the surveillance effort within slaughterhouse s. A training exercise in 2010 was associated with an increase in the number of incidents disclosed through this type of surveillance . The lower percentages of incidents disclosed through slaughterhouse surveillance in 2003 and 2009 may have been due to the resumption of live animal testing following the 2001 FMD outbreak . Likewise, the increase in live animal testin g for Health Check Wales in 2008 was associated with a decrease in the percentage of incidents disclosed through slaughterhouse surveillance . These effects were more evident in the Intermediate North, Mid and Low TB Areas. Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 63 High East High West Intermediate Mid Intermediate North Low Wales the slaughterhouse Year Figure 3.6.1: Percentage of OTF -W incidents disclosed in the slaughterhouse, by TB Area, 2010 -2019 The geographical distribution of new slaughterhouse incidents in 2019 (Figure 3.6.2) reflects the distribution of total TB incidents (i.e. those detected by live animal testing or slaughte rhouse inspection) ( Figure 3.1.2 ). More s laughterhouse -detected incidents occur in the High West and High East TB Areas where the burden of disease and background infection is highest (27 and 16 disclosed in 2019 , respectively). There were 10 TB incidents disclosed in the slaughterhouse in the Intermediate Mid TB Area , with sporadic incidents occurring in the remaining TB Areas (3 in Low, 1 in Intermediate North). This is disproportionate to the overall number of TB incidents disclosed in the Intermediate Mid TB Area . As discussed further on (Table 3.6.1), where the Intermediate Mid TB Area has much higher odds of a TB incident being disclosed in the slaughterhouse, this is likely to be related to reduced sensitivi ty of skin testing in this area (60% of TB incidents disclosed in the slaughterhouse occurred after clear skin tests by one practice). Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 64 Figure 3. 6.2: New TB incidents disclo sed in the slaughterhouse, 2019 The sensitivity of slaughterhouse surveillance, i .e. the ability of the surveillance to identify truly infected animals, can be affected by multiple factors such as: Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 65 disease intrinsic factors such as the stage of disease in the animal and associated pathology , herd characteristics e.g. size, type, or l ocation , which may affect the prevalence of disease and hence the positive predictive value of detection or, intrinsic slaughterhouse processes such as management of the line, staff training . These factors should be taken into account when assessing the odds of an incident being detected to control for any effects they might have on the direction or magnitude of the outcome. The results of a logistic regression analysis of the associations between herd type, herd size and geographical area on the odds (see Appendix 1 for details on odds ratios) of an OTF - W incident being disclosed in the slaughterhouse in 2019 are presented in Table 3. 6.1. After a djust ing for herd size and location, dairy herds had significantly lower odds of an OTF - W incident being dis closed in the slaughterhouse, compared to beef herds. This may be as a result of high rates of detected lesions in beef cattle. After controlling for the effects of herd type and location, herd sizes of less than 300 animals were associated with significan tly lower odds of an OTF -W incident being disclosed in the slaughterhouse, relative to herds with more than 300 animals. After controlling for the effects of herd size and type, the odds of an OTF -W incident being disclosed in the slaughterhouse was nearl y three times higher in the Intermediate Mid TB Area, compared to the High West TB Area. This could suggest that either the sensitivity of slaughterhouse surveillance varies by TB Area , or that there is geographic clustering of Official Veterinarian (OV) surveillance test performance issues . All other TB Areas were not significantly associated with increased or decreased odds of disclosing an OTF -W slaughterhouse incident , relative to the High West TB Area.

A homerange is defined as, a 5km square where there have been at least three incidents of a specific genotype on at least two holdings within a five year period. As observed in Figure 3.7.1, a 1 0km buffer is applied to create the homeranges of each genotype. There are four genotypes with large homeranges across Wales , although other genotypes are still recorded in Wales (see Figure 5.4.1) . Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 69 The number of TB incidents disclosed in cattle moved into a herd that are out of herd or out of home -range genotypes, is described in Table 3.7.1. In Wales overall, over 50% of OTF-W incidents had a genotype and of these, 8 1% of the genotypes identified were within the home -range. The percentage of TB incidents within a home -range is substantially greater in the High East, High West and Intermediate North TB Areas, compared to other TB A reas of Wales which have little or no home range s associated with them .

Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 71 3.8Incidents disclosed by trace testing, pre -movement or post -movement testing & contiguous testing Tracing and contiguous tests are categorised under the s urveillance stream for 'Area and Herd Risk', whereas pre -and post -movement testing is categorized as 'Trade and other'. Both are considered active surveillance through field testing of herds or individual cattle. They occur where there is evidence that ca ttle are at greater risk of being infected, or conducted for the purposes of trade. Post-incident, contiguous and tracing tests are not recorded if they are conducted at the same time as a routine surveillance test (e.g. whole - herd test). Area risk tests are carried out on herds contiguous to OTF -W incidents, outside of their regular test frequency. Movement risk tests include tracing and pre -and post -movement tests. Tracing tests are carried out in cattle moved from OTF -W herds prior to 'service of restrictions'. Pre -movement tests are carried out prior to cattle movements and are required for herds in High and Intermediate TB Areas and higher risk herds in the Low TB Area. Post-movement tests are carried out where cattle have been moved to a holding without a required pre -movement test. They are required on holdings in the Low TB Area for cattle moved from higher risk areas in England and Wales. Tracing tests can target higher risk herds. They are usually animal tests, where a single animal or proportion of a herd is tested, rather than the whole herd. Tracing and other trade tests are important in terms of monitoring and preventing spread, for example, through movement of higher risk herds to other herds . Source tracings also identify herds of origin not previously detected. Close to half of all TB incidents disclosed in the High East and West TB Areas were disclosed by contiguous testing (43% and 46%, respectively), compared to 38% in the Intermediate North TB Area, 25% in the Intermediate Mid TB Area an d 17% in the Low TB Area (Table 3.8.1). Tracing tests disclosed very few TB incidents (one to five TB incidents in each TB Area).

This section look s at the percentage of herds with recurrent TB incidents, to identify how recurrence changes over t ime and to describe factors associated with recurrence. A recurrent incident is defined in this report as the first TB incident disclosed during the Current Period (2019) where the herd was previously under restriction for TB at any time during a History Period. The History Period is defined as the 36 months preceding the start date of the recurrent incident or, where no recurrent incident has occurred in a herd, is the 36 months prior to the mid -point of the Current Period6. Further details are provided i n Appendix 1. Of all herds that had a history of TB consistent with the definition outlined above, 16% (260/ 1,586 ) had a new TB incident in 2019, similar to the percentage s observed in preceding years. Eighty -six per cent of herds (9,754/11,340) did not h ave any TB incidents in either the Current or History period; a similar percentage to that observed in previous years. Herds that had a new TB incident in 201 9 were significantly more likely to have been placed under movement restrictions due to a TB incident during the History period compared with herds that remained OTF in the Current period in all TB Areas (p<0.01 , Fisher's Exact test) apart from in the Low T B Area (p>0.05 , Fishers Exact test). Herds with a new TB incident in 2019 that had their OTF status withdrawn in the previous three years (history period), would be classed as OTF -W by definition . Therefore, herds with a new OTF -W incident in 2019 were si gnificantly more likely to have been restricted due to an OTF -W incident during the History period compared with herds that had a new OTF -S incident in 2019 (p<0.05 by Fisher's Exact test), in all TB Areas . Tables 3.9.1 (a -e) detail the number and percenta ge of herds according to their TB status in 2019, and the history period of the previous 36 months, broken down by TB Area. 6 The recurrence analyses included all herds active at the end of the Current Period (2019). Herds that were under restriction for fou r or more months in the Current Period due to an incident that started prior to the Current Period were excluded from the analyses. It was considered that such herds had limited opportunity to become cases since there may have been no further testing in th e Current Period following the close of the incident. Setting a threshold of four months allows for the detection of possible recurrence at the 'six months' (6M) test scheduled after lifting of restrictions in herds within the first four months of the curr ent year; Some latitude was allowed for practical issues relating to scheduling of tests towards year end of the Current Period.

Herds under restriction for four or more months of 2019 due to an incident that started before 2019, were excluded from analyses (n=435). Apart from a decline in the percentage of OTF herds with TB history in 2015 and 2016, the percentage of herds with an incident in all TB Areas has since remained stable, at around 20% in the High East and West TB Areas, 10% in the Intermediate North, around 6% in the Intermediate Mid and around 3% in the Low TB Areas (Figure 3.9.1a). Figure 3.9.1b shows the percentage of recurrent TB herds with a TB incident in 2019. This does not split TB incidents by OTF -W and OTF -S as there are very few OTF -S incidents. The trend for declining recurrent incidents closely reflects the patterns of overall TB incidence, irrespective of incident classification. This is expected as declines in incidence in one year will result in fewer herds with a history of TB at a later dat e. Apart from the Intermediate Mid TB Area that had 6% of OTF-S incidents with TB history, all other TB Areas had none . The percentage of recurrent TB herds with a TB incident in 2019 increased in all TB Areas apart from the High East TB Area (Figure 3.9.1 b), but this percentage has varied over the previous five years. The High East TB Area has shown a decreasing trend since 2016 from over 50% to 40%. In the High West TB Area, the percentage of recurrent herds with an OTF - W incident in the reporting year de creased between 2015 and 2017 but increased again in 2019 to nearly 50%. In the Intermediate Mid and North TB Areas, the percentage of recurrent Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 79 TB herds with OTF -W incidents has increased from around 25% in 2018 to nearly 40% in 2019. The percentage of OT F-W incidents with TB history in the Low TB Area has varied year on year, likely due to the much lower numbers of TB incidents disclosed in the area. In 2019, the percentage was around 15% (based on three OTF -W incidents).

The odds ratio represents the probabilit y of a herd having a TB incident in the current year following an incident in the previous 36 months, compared with the odds of a TB incident occurring where there is no history of an incident. A total of 410 herds defined as 'Other/ Mixed' herd type were removed from the logistic regression analysis because the model would not converge with them included . There were no herds in 2019 (categorised as 'Other' with a TB incident). The odds of a new incident occurring in herds with TB history were consistently greater than for those with no TB history. Herds with over 10 animals had significantly greater odds of having a recurrent TB incident. However the odds ratio for the remaining herd size categories was very similar, ranging from 1.6 to 2.0 with the confid ence intervals overlapping, therefore it is not possible to discern true differences in these categories. Beef herds with TB history were twice as likely to have a TB incident in 2019 compared to herds with no TB history (Dairy herds were 1.6 times more li kely to have a TB incident, where herds had history of TB, compared to no TB history). The odds of a herd incurring a new TB incident in 2019 was twice as high in herds with TB history in the High West and Intermediate North, but 3.3 times greater in the I ntermediate Mid TB Area. In the High East and Low TB Areas, the increase in the odds ratio was not statistically significant. Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 81 Of the 260 recurrent TB incidents included in the analyses, the time elapsed between the most recent TB incident in the history pe riod and the start date of the first TB incident in the current period (2019) ranged from 13 days to around 36 months (Appendix Table 5). The median time elapsed was nearly 8 months for OTF -S incidents in 2019, and around 29 months for any incident type wi th an OTF -W incident in the history period . For total TB and OTF-W incidents disclosed in 2019 with a recurrent TB incident, the time between incidents tended to be longer where the incident (in the History Period) was classified as OTF -W.

Within the 410 h erds, there were Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 82 four with a TB incident in the history period, none of which had a TB incident in 2019, and of the 406 herds with no TB history, six had a TB incident in 2019. The distribution of recurrent TB incidents has been similar over the last five years (Figure 3.9.2) . Although there has been a decline in the High East and West TB Areas in recent years, the majority of recurrent TB incidents are concentrated in these areas (in the High East TB Area, they are concentrated closest to the bordering Eng lish counties). The majority of recurrent herds in 2019 had experienced just one previous OTF -W incident in the history period, only three herds' experienced three incidents in 2019. There were no TB incidents in 2019 that had had four OTF -W incidents in t he last 3 years , and this has been observed in Wales for over five years. Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 83 Figure 3.9.2: Herds with new bovine TB incidents in 2019 that had had between one and three OTF-W incidents in the previous 36 months (recurrent incident herds) Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 84 3.10 TB incidents up to and including the 6M test where reactors had been IRs in previous TB incidents Inconclusive reactors (IRs) are cattle which have a reaction to bovine tuberculin from the SICCT test, but not large enough to be classified as a reactor (result is neither clear nor positive). IRs are placed under movement restrictions and can be retested 60 days after the date of the last test. At the next test, if an animal is clear (or negative), they can re-join the herd and move off restrictions (resolved IRs). If the animal is not clear (either 2xIR or now a reactor), they are classed as a reactor. T he herd is placed under movement restrictions, reactors are removed and cattle are tested in short -interval (SI) tests until such time that all tests are negative and the herd is classified as clear from infection (see Appendix Table 1 for further informat ion on the definition of standard and severe interpretation of the test) . Severe interpretation is used in TB incidents with lesion and/or culture positive animals that meet certain criteria and indicate they are at increased risk of infection, for example where more than one reactor has been found. Severe interpretation is applied to the first SI test and also to the second if any IRs were found at the first test. IRs can be an important predictor for the presence of TB infection in a herd. Table 3.10.1 shows the number of TB incidents with reactors (or 2/3xIRs) that had been an IR in a preceding TB incident, which ended within nine months of the current (2019) TB incident. The percentage of TB incidents (where reactors had previously been IRs) was simila r for the High West and Intermediate North TB Areas (6.5 and 6.7%, respectively). The High East TB Area also had the largest number of total reactors (n=60), although the maximum number of reactors per incident was actually highest in the Intermediat e Mid TB Area (n=11). The percentage was lowest in the High East TB Area (2.4%). Table 3.10.1 . Number of TB incidents up to and including the six monthly test, where reactors had previ ously been IRs.

Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 86 3.11 Inconclusive reactor herds that subsequently suffered an incident This section analyses the fate of herds in the fifteen months following an initial herd test where: the herd was not already under restriction and there were no unresolved inconclusive reactors (IR) in the herd at the time of the initial herd test one or more IRs were found an incident was not disclosed by the initial herd test the test took place in the 12 months prece ding the reporting year to allow for a 15 month follow -up period This type of initial herd test is described as an IR-only test. The current minimum interval between retests of IRs is 60 days. IRs are tested either on their own or, in a herd where reactors were found, with the rest of the herd. It is important to quantify IR -only herds that suffer subsequent incidents as animals in these herds may in fact be infected at the IR -only test. When IRs are identified in unrestricted herds, the whole herd is plac ed under movement restrictions which remain in force if there are: Any reactor animals in addition to the IR, or If the herd has had a confirmed (OTF -W) incident in the last three years. In all other cases, only the IRs will be subject to movement restrictions and the herd OTF status will be restored for domestic trade purposes, however export trade is restricted pending re -testing of the IRs7. There were 863 IR -only herds that had IR -retests in Wales in 2019, of which 126 (15%) had an OTF -W incide nt at and an OTF -S incident. remaining 715 (83%) were clear at the IR -retest. Therefore a new TB incident was detected at the IR -retest in 148 (17%) herds with IR -only tests in 2019. Of the 715 herds that tested clear at an IR retest, 698 subsequently had a whole herd test (WHT) within the 15 -month follow up period. Significantly more IR -only herds (17%, n=116) went on to have a TB incident at the next WHT, compared to non-IR herds in 2019 (5%; 482/8,946) (p<0.001 Fis hers Exact test). The percentage s observed in 2019 were similar to those observed in recent years. Figures 3.11.1 and 3.11.2 show the 10 year trends in the percentage of IR -only herds with a new TB incident at the IR retest or subsequent whole herd test since 2010 , where there has been a sustained drop in t he herd -level failure rate at IR retest . The p ercentage of IR - only herds with a subsequent OTF -S incident has decreased considerably since 2010, to 3% in 2018 and 2019, related to the change in the way incidents we re classified from 2011 (Figure 3.11.1) . The p ercentage of IR -only herds that a subsequent OTF -W incident at the IR retest was around 9% up to 2011 before increasing to 17% in 2013. This increase 7 https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/733938/AG -TBYHW - 03.pdf Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 87 would be expected as more herds were classified as OTF -W from 2011 onwards (See Appendix 1 for details on classification of TB incidents) . Since then , the p ercentage of IRs preceding an OTF -W incident has remained relatively stable since 2013 , between 15% and 17%. The percentage of herds that had a new TB incid ent following a clear IR -retest is similar to the percentage of IR -only herds with a new TB incident at the IR -retest, suggesting that the IR retest is not predictive of new TB incidents (Figure 3.11.2). % with any subsequent incident % with subsequent OTFW incident % with subsequent OTFS incident 35 30 25 20 15 10% with incident at IR retest 0 5 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Year Figure 3.11.1: Percentage of IR -only herds with a new TB incident at the IR -retest Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 88 % with any subsequent incident % with subsequent OTFW incident % with subsequent OTFS incident 25 20 15 10% with incident after clear IR retest 0 5 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Year Figure 3.11.2: P ercentage of herds that had a new TB incident following a clear IR - retest1 1Herds that did not have a whole herd test within the 15 month follow up period were excluded from the denominator The percentag e of IR -only herds that had a new incident at the IR retest varies by herd size, herd type, and TB Area (Table 3.11.1). The percentage of IR -only herds with an OTF - W incident at retest was fairly similar across herd size categories with more than 10 animal s, the highest being 18.3% in the 201 -300 herd size category. Excluding the 'Other' herd type category which had two of five IR -only herds having an OTF -W incident at retest, the percentage of beef herds was higher than dairy (15.6% and 13%, respectively). When comparing TB Areas, the High East had the highest percentage of OTF -W incidents disclosed at the retest (23.8%), followed by the High West (14.8%) . Demographic and geographical factors which are associated with higher rates of TB are also associated with higher levels of IR -only herds going on to have a subsequent incident. Simila rly to the IR -only herds, the percentage of clear herds that had a new TB incident at a subsequent WHT in the 15 month period also varied by herd size and was highest in herds with >300 cattle (33%). By herd type, more dairy had a new TB incident at a subsequent WHT compared to beef (23% vs 12%) . By TB Area, the percentage was highest in the Intermediate Mid (23%) and High West TB Areas (22%). This suggests that in some TB Areas, IR -only herds are more likely to suffer an incident at a subsequent whole herd test than at the initial retest.

As expected, the number of IRs per 1,000 animal tests was highest in the High West TB Area, where the density is highest. There are areas of increased IR density in parts of the Intermediate North and Mid, High East and even Low TB Areas, although in ar eas of low density, a 'hotspot' could be representative of just one OTF-W incident at retest or post -retest.

The data has been split by OTF -S and OTF -W (at retest and at the subsequent test, approximately 15 months following the retest). A total of 599 IR herds had no TB incident in the following 15 months (at IR retest or subsequent test). Twenty -two herds had an OTF -S incident at retest, four with an OTF -S incident at the subsequent test (post retest). There were 126 herds with an OTF -W incident at the retest and 112 herds OTF -W at the subsequent test (post retest). IRs are tested either on their own or in a herd where reactors were identified, with the rest of the herd. It is important to identify IR -only herds that suffer from subsequent TB incidents, as the cattle in these herds may already have been infected at the IR -only test. Retests of IRs is usuall y around 60 days, with a subsequent test 12 months later (to allow for a 15 month follow -up period). Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 96 Figure 3.11.6: IR herds with no subsequent TB incident; a or OTF -S incident at the IR retest or at the test subsequent to a clear IR retest wi thin fifteen months, 2019 Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 97 3.12 Understanding the fate of IRs Determining what happens to IRs at the animal level is crucial for reviewing the policy applied to these animals. A flow -diagram identifying the fate of IRs taking into account testing history and slaughterhouse surveillance has been developed (Figure 3.12.1). The cohort of animals that were followed were those with an inconclusive reaction at the initial test outside of an incident in 201 8, and these animals were followed for 15 months after the initial test. Figure 3.12.1 is split into two sections. T he initial IR sequence (above the grey line) follows animals through to testing clear or becoming a 2xIR, 3xIR8, reactor or being removed . The subsequent IR sequence (below the grey line) describes what happens to animals that test clear at IR retesting. An IR can test clear at the first or third retest, and this is represented by the two streams in the subsequent IR sequence. If an animal becomes a 2xIR using the standard interpretation of the test (and was a standard IR on both occasions) , it is removed for s laughter. If it becomes a 2xIR using the severe interpretation of the test (at least once) , it has a second retest using the IFN- test. Passing that triggers another skin test and if the animal becomes a 3xIR, it is removed for slaughter as a reactor. Of the 2,726 IR -only animals that had an inconclusive reaction to the skin test in 2018, 2,163 (79%) tested clear at the first retest, and over half (1,172; 54%) of these remained clear during the follow up period. A further 51 5 were routinely slaughtered and 513 screened negative in the slaughterhouse. Of the 1,172 animals that tested clear during the follow -up period, 35 (3%) tested clear again but the herd went on to become a reactor within three months of the test and 81 animals (7%) within 12 months (data not shown). In this same period there were 148,654 clear tests at the initial IR test, of which 113,953 (77%) remained clear. The remaining 23% were made up of those animals not tested again (20%), IRs not slaughtered (2%), standard reactors (0.3%) and s evere reactors, DCs and slaughtered IRs (0.4%). The remaining animals (less than 0.02%) were either missing a clear test from a negative slaughterhouse case (n=13), or were slaughterhouse cases (n=12). Of the 2,163 IR -only animals which tested clear at the first retest, 161 (7%) became a reactor or an IR within the original incident, and a further 88 (4%) became a reactor or an IR at a test subsequent to the original incident. Two animals from this cohort went on to be slaughterhouse cases within the 15 mon ths following their initial 1xIR result. Of a total of 12 animals which were neither subjected to a n IFN- test nor slaughtered despite a 2xIR result, 10 tested clear at their second retest. There were 120 animals cleared by IFN- 2xIR that also tested cle ar at their third retest. Seventeen of these animals went on to become reactors (both at severe interpretation) during the 15 month follow -up period and three became an IR again, all during the original incident. Eighteen animals which tested 8 Animals having two successive tests giving inconclusive reactor measurements are generally considered to be skin test reactors, but may be described as \"IRs After 2 [or more] tests as IR\" to distinguish them from other reactors in some parts of this report. IRs may be re -classified as reactors when interpreted severely.

In 2019, there were 201 ongoing TB incidents, most (99%) of which were OTF -W and over half were located in the High West TB Area (63%). Six per cent of Welsh herds incurred a new TB incident in 2019 and 5.5% of herds were under movement restrictions in mid -December 2019. Since the implementation of annual testing in 2013 , the percentage of herds under restriction has remained relatively s table at around 5 to 5.5%. The median duration of OTF -W incidents has remained relatively stable over the past ten years, averaging 240 days. OTF-W incidents of very long duration (over 18 months) tended to be clustered in the High TB Areas in the West a nd East, affecting South West Wales and in counties along the border with England. There were a total of 135 persistent (duration over 18 months) open TB incidents in 2019, with 67% located in the High West TB Area. A total of 39 TB incidents that closed in 2019 were classed as persi stent, all of which were OTF -W. The majority (87%) were located in the High West and East TB Areas (24 and 10, respectively), followed by The Intermediate Mid and North TB Areas (three and two, respectively) with none located i n the Low TB Area. 4.1Summary of closed and ongoing incidents in Wales A total of 477 TB incidents in Wales closed during 2019, having begun prior to 2019. Similarly to all new TB incidents disclosed in 2019 , most (81%) were located in the High West and E ast TB Areas (Table 4.1.1) . There were a total of 201 ongoing TB incidents (started prior to 2019) in Wales, 199 (99%) of which were OTF -W incidents (Table 4.1.1) . The number of ongoing incidents has nearly doubled in the past five years ( Figure S2 in Sum mary ). The majority of ongoing TB incidents were located in the High West TB Area (127, 63%), with a further 23% ( 47) in the High East TB Area. There were very few ongoing TB incidents in the remainder of Wales.

Chapter 3 described incidence in Welsh her ds in 2019 and over time. This chapter focuses on prevalence o f TB (considering the percentage of cattle herds under TB restriction for TB at certain point in time or over a period). It also reports how long any restrictions to herds are in place (duration of TB). Prevalence of TB relates to the number of infected cattle in a population at a particular time and can vary across Welsh TB Areas and over time. Spatial and temporal patterns of TB prevalence may vary according to the dynamics of the disease, cons idering environmental conditions and demographics of the cattle population. The method used to determine prevalence of TB in Welsh cattle herds is described in detail in Appendix 1 . For the purposes of this report, prevalence of TB is calculated as the Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 102 proportion of herds that are under movement restriction s on a given date due to a TB incident (mid-December), per 100 live (or active) herds (excluding herds restricted due to an overdue test). Six per cent of Welsh herds incurred a TB incident in 2019 and 5.5% of herds were under movement restrictions in mid -December 2019 (excluding herds under restriction due to an overdue test ). As expected, prevalence varied by TB Area, and with over half of TB incidents in 2019 located in the High West TB Area, prevalen ce was highest here too (11%, Table 4.2.1a and b ). Table 4.2.1 a: Herds under restriction -December) , 2019 TB Area Total incidents OTF-W OTF-S High East High West Intermediate Mid 176 350 52 169 341 44 7 9 8 Intermediate North Low 52 17 50 15 2 2 Table 4.2.1 b: Prevalence of TB in Wales, 2019 TB Area Total OTF-W OTF-S incidents Total number incidents incidents per per 100 live of herds2 per 100 100 live herds live herds herds High East 6.3 6.0 0.2 2,813 High West 11.0 10.7 0.3 3,188 Intermediate Mid 2.5 2.2 0.4 2,041 Intermediate North 5.6 5.4 0.2 922 Low 0.6 0.5 0.1 2,828 2 This is the number of 'live' herds in mid -December 2019 so differs from the herd number given in Chapter 1. 4.3Temporal trends in TB prevalence in Wales In recent years, prevalence has peaked on an approximate three -yearly basis, for example, in May 2009 (7.7%), July 2012 (7.0%), and May 2015 (5.8%) and at January 2019 (5.9%) (Figure 4.3.1). The explanation for this oscillation in prevalence is unclear but could be associated with the high risk of recurrence of infection in herds and the sequence (or frequency) by which herds were tested in relation to TB risk before annual testing was introduced (where herds from low incidence areas were tested on a less f requent basis). Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 103 Following a p eak in July 2012, the percentage of herds under restriction declined to around 5%, and has since remained relatively stable where annual testing has been in place since 2013. Since 2010, the number of active (or live) herds has decreased from around 13,000 to 11,500 in 2016. The number of herds has since fluctuated between 11,500 and 12,000, due to the creation of additional CPHs in 2018. During the same period of time, the num ber of TB incidents increased up to 2012, followed by a sharp decrease through 2013 and 2014. Since then, the number of herds under movement restrictions has remained relatively stable, fluctuating between 600 and 700 each year. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 % of herds under movement restrictions Year Total incidents OTF-W incidents 12-month moving average (total incidents) 12-month moving average (OTF-W incidents) Figure 4.3.1 : Percentage of herds that were under movement restrictions between January 2010 and December 2019 (12-month moving average) Figure 4.3.2 shows the temporal trend of TB prevalence over the last ten years which along with incidence measures (as described in Chapter 3, I ncidence of TB), is used to assess the scale of the TB epidemic in Wales. This shows similar data to Figure 4.3.1, but is the point prevalence for each year (rather than a 12-month moving average ), and splits the data by total TB, OTF -W and OTF -S incidents . Since a peak in 2012 followed by a sharp decrease in 2013, the prevalence of total TB and OTF-W incidents remained relatively stable at around 4.5 to 5.5 herds restricted per 100 live herds . Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 104 OTF-W incidents are under movement restrictions for longer per iods compared to OTF -S incidents as they require a second clear short -interval test (SIT) before movement restrictions can be lifted. Also, as new OTF -W incidents in the Low and Intermediate North TB Areas are subject to mandatory herd IFN- tests, this co uld lead to prolonged movement restrictions if additional reactors are disclosed. As expected, OTF -S incidence and prevalence has declined over time, particularly since 2011, probably as an artefact of OTF - S incidents being reclassified as OTF -W. Total incidents OTF-W incidents OTF-S incidents Year Figure 4.3.2: Point prevalence of herds under movement restrictions in each TB Area of Wales, December of each year (2010 -2019) 4.4Prevalence of TB across Wales When comparing the prevalence of TB by risk area in Wales, the percentage of herds under movement res trictions (per 100 live herds) is greater in the High East and West TB Areas compared to Wales overall (Figure 4.4.1). Generally prevalence in other TB Areas of Wales is lower than the country average, but in the Intermediate North, prevalence has increased since 2016. Prevalence of TB remains highest in the High West TB Area, at around 11% for 2019. Since the end of 2017, prevalence in the High East TB Area has decreased to around 6% which is only just higher than for Wales overall and the Interme diate North TB Area. Prevalence in the Intermediate North TB Area increased sharply in 2016 and 20 17, but has since remained relatively stable through 2018 and 2019.

Herds under restriction for longer periods , increases the socioeconomic burden for both the farmer and government managing the incident. However, such movement restrictions are necessary for ensuring infection has been eliminated from a herd t hrough the identification and removal of any remaining infected animals. This reduces the risk of recurrence (discussed in Chapter 3). Restrictions are maintained until there is sufficient evidence from negative tests to believe that infection has been rem oved from the herd. Factors that could increase the duration of movement restrictions include ; poor responsiveness of some animals to the skin test, intense cattle -to- cattle transmission (occurring, for example, in large herds), and continuing reinfection (e.g. from wildlife or neighbouring herds). The duration of incidents closing in 2019 varies according to TB Area (Table 4.5.1). The difference between the mean and the median reflects the number of outliers in the distribution which again varies by TB ar ea - i.e. incidents lasting for many years. The duration of movement restrictions of OTF -S incidents in all TB Areas was significantly shorter than those of OTF -W incidents (P<0.001 , p<0.01 for 70 to 100% of OTF -S incidents closed with in 150 days, compared to 0% to 12% OTF -W incidents , depending on TB Area. This reflects the different management protocols for OTF -W and OTF -S incidents in Wales . OTF-S incidents require one clear whole herd test, while OTF-W incidents require a second c lear test (with a minimum of 60 days from the first clear test) before movement restrictions can be lifted. H igher -sensitivity severe interpretation of the skin test is also used in OTF -W incidents and the y are also likely to take longer to clear .

However, there was a 2.5% increase in 2019 compared to 2018. From January 2011, some TB incidents that would have traditionally been classifie d as OTF - S were instead classified as OTF -W for epidemiological reasoning. This meant that some of the longer -lasting OTF -S incidents were lost from the OTF -S cohort, reducing the mean duration . These incidents were still shorter than the existing OTF -W ca ses, further reducing the OTF -W mean duration . Figures 4. 5.1b and c show the median duration for OTF -W and OTF -S incidents, respectively, with the 25th and 75th percentiles illustrated as error bars showing the wider variation in the duration of OTF -W inc idents.

Also presented are regress ion coefficients, which indicate the size and direction of the associations between incident duration (outcome) and herd size, type and geographical area (predictors). The coefficients of the categories within the predictor variables are calculated relativ e to a reference category (\"Ref\") (see Materials and Methods for explanation of the choice of reference category). Coeffi cients greater than zero , i.e. positive coefficients, indicate that the incident duration is longer in that category than in the refere nce category, whereas negative coefficients indicate the duration is shorter compared with the reference category. The median duration of movement restrictions following a TB incident increased with herd size and was significantly shorter in herds with few er than 200 animals compared with the largest herds (>300 animals) . This effect remained for herds with between 11 and 200 animals after adjusting for herd type and location. This is not surprising since increasing Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 111 herd size is likely to increase density -dependent transmission of infection and could also increase the likelihood of false negatives in the herd. Duration of movement restrictions in herds with 201 -300 cattle was not significantly different to herds with over 300 animals (the median was 242 day s compared to 315 days in herds with over 300 cattle). Although the multivaria te regression analysis attempts to adjust for herd size, this is likely to be incomplete because herd size is imperfectly measured, i.e. it does not account for the number and si ze of any epidemiological groups within a herd and cannot account for within -herd clustering. After adjusting for herd size and location, the duration of movement restrictions following a TB incident was significantly longer in dairy herds compared with beef herds. This is consistent with the effect observed over the previous five years. Incident duration varie d significantly between TB Areas. Relative to the High West TB Area, incidents were shorter in all other TB Areas in Wales, however this effect did not remain for all areas after adjusting for herd size, type and OTF status. Only the High East and Intermed iate Mid TB Areas observed a significantly shorter duration of movement restrictions compared to the reference category, the High West TB Area.

Persistent TB incidents could be caused by factors including: Limitations of tests in finding all infected animals, particularly in large herds, due to presence of animals that fail to react to the test, with continued within -herd transmission. Purchased animals Transmission from wildlife or contiguous herds. Persistent TB incidents are costly to government and industry and also pose a risk to surrounding herds, therefore these are targeted with enhanced measures to cle ar infection as quickly as possible ( https://gov.wales/sites/default/files/publications/2017 -11/wales - bovine -tb-eradication -programme.pdf ). Herds under restrictions for long periods of time may occur due to a number of factors which affect the ability to clear a herd of infection, as discussed at the start of this section. OTF-W incidents of very long duration (over 18 months) tended to be cl ustered in the High TB Areas in the West and East, affecting South West Wales and in counties along the border with England (Figure 4.6.1). Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 114 Figure 4.6.1 Number of OTF-W incidents by duration category (days) , that closed in 2019 Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 115 A total of 39 OTF -W incidents were classed as persistent, which had closed in 2019 . Figure 4.6.2 which shows the geographical location of persistent TB herds under movement restrictions for more than 550 days. In areas where there were fewer incidents, inclu ding the Low TB Area, these tended to be of shorter duration. However, some isolated incidents of long duration did occur in the Intermediate TB Areas (two in the Intermediate North and three in the Intermediate Mid TB Area , lasting more than 550 days). There were a total of 54 OTF -S incidents that closed in 2019, with only two herds in the High West TB Area that had been under restrictions for longer than 240 days (Table 4. 5.1). In 2019, there were no OTF-S incidents in Wales t hat were considered persistent.

The recent increase in reactors is primarily attributable to increases in IFN- testing, which is more sensitive than the SICCT test (90%9 sensitivity compared to 81%10 (sensitivity of SICCT tests varying between 50 -90% depending on conditions under which it is carried out11), respectively) . In the High West, Intermediate North and Low TB Areas, the percentage of cattle with lesions that wer e M. bovis positive was higher for reactors than for direct contacts and inconclusive reactors; whereas in the High East and Intermed iate Mid TB Areas the percentage of cattle with lesions that were M. bovis positive was highest for direct contacts. In Wales overall, 29% of reactors (at standard interpretation) were confirmed infected by either observation of detect able lesions (DL) or culture of M. bovis in 2019. This was higher in the High East TB Area (46%) and lower in all other TB Areas West; 2 4%, TB 28%). The percentage of samples with detectable lesions (DLs) that were M. bovis positive varied by TB Area and was highest in the High TB East Area (96%) and lowest in the Low TB Area ( 67%). Of the 12, 599 cattle slaughtered in 2019 for TB control, 68% were reactors to either the skin test , IFN- or antibody test , 25% were IRs and 7% were DCs. 9 de la Rua -Domenech, R, Goodchild, AV, et al.

The percentage positive was highest in the High East and Low TB Areas (2.3 and 3.4% respectively). There were 377 isolates from cattle for incidents in Wales that started in 2019 and all were genotyped . The most common genotype in Wales (spoligotype 9) ha s two main clusters: one in the south -west corner of Wales and the other mainly located in Mid Powys (Figure 5.6.1). Forty three non -bovine isolates were genotyped in 2019. 5.1Number of suspected TB cases that were slaughtered12 The single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) test is more sensitive than slaughterhouse inspection for detecting cattle at an early stage of infection with M. bovis . Lesion and culture results for animals slaughtered according to various TB risks (reactors, inconclusive reactors (IRs) or direct contacts (DCs)) are illustrated in this chapter, which reports on the total number of TB suspect cattle slaughtered per year , regardless of when the incident started. There were 12, 599 cattle slaughtered in 2019 for TB control . This is a 9% increase in the number of cattle slaughtered compared with 2018, following a general increasing trend over the past five years. Of the cat tle slaughtered in 2019, 68.2% (8,588) were reactors to either the skin test or IFN -. This total also includes 272 antibody tests. Twenty five per cent of cattle slaughtered were IRs (3,130 ) and 7% ( 881) were DCs (Figure 5.1.1). In addition, there were 58 slaughterhouse cases where retrospective evidence of TB was identified in cattle from OTF herds (see Chapter 3). This distribution differs from England13 where 94% of compulsorily slaughtered animals were reactors, 4% were IRs and 2% were DCs. The higher percentage of IRs in Wales could be in part due to all IRs in chronic herd incidents being slaughtered (as part of the ongoing Action Plan process). Overall in 2019, lesions were detected in 9%14 (1,156) of slaughtered animals, although this percentage varied depending on the method of disclosure: reactors (1 2%), IRs (2%) or DCs 12 Defra statistics report true reactors, IRx2 and IRx3 as \"reactors\" (which are compulsorily slaughtered) , whereas in this report \"reactors \" includes only true reactors (including severe interpretation ), and not IRx2 or IRx3. Defra statistics report only IRx1 as IRs whereas this report includes IRx1, IRx2 -britain -2019 14 Samples are not sent for culture from t he majority of reactors, IRs, and DCs, irrespective of whether they have detected lesions or not (Figure 5.1.1). Consequently, this data should not be used to estimate the true proportion of animals slaughtered for TB that would have been confirmed as TB positive via culture. However, since so few animals Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 119 (4%) (Figure 5.1 .1). This also varie d according to whether the skin testing was standard (29%) or severe interpretation (6%), or if reactors were identified via IFN- testing (3% ). There is also wider variation when comparing different TB Areas, with the highest percentage of standard and IFN- reactors with DLs in the High East TB Area (46% and 5% respectively), and the highest percentage of severe interpretation reactors with DL s in the Low TB Area (15%; Table 5.1.2). A lower percentage of IFN- positive animals with DLs was anticipated, due to the greater sensitivity of the IFN- test. The increased sensitivity of the IFN - test (90%15) allows for the detection of disease at an earlier stage of infection before pathology (i.e. lesions ) has developed. The IFN - test has a lower specificity compared to the SICCT (96.6% and 99.98%, respectively16) which means that the test is more likely to generate false positive results. without detected lesions are found to be positive via culture test, we would not expect the true proportion to differ by much. 15 Karolemeas K, de la Rua -Domenech R, Cooper R, Goodchild AV, Clifton -Hadley RS, et al.

The 5 -year trend in the number of one -, two -and three -times IR animals and DCs slaughtered is shown in Figure 5.1.2b. The number of reactors and IRs slaughtered annually, has increased over the past ten years, with over 8, 500 animals slaughtered as reactors, and around 3,000 IRs in the current reporting year. The recent increase in reactors is primarily attributable to increases in IFN- testing, which is more sensitive than the skin te st. IFN- testing is used to help clear infection in recurrent and persistent TB incidents and to prevent disease from becoming established in low incidence areas. There was a sharp apparent increase in the number of DCs slaughtered in 2016 and 2017, where the total nearly doubled compared to 2015. This has since decreased, with 881 in 2019. Since 2017, there has been a large increase in the number of IRs slaughtered (1,731, 2,754 and 3,130 for 2017 -2019, respectively). These changes primarily reflect how some IRs were recorded in the SAM database. During 2016, official veterinarians were directed to apply more sensitive testing procedures in certain circumstances, an d this included removing IRs. Until April 2017, it was not possible to record these cases as IRs on SAM in such a way as to enable the intended removal and compensation processes to take place. Therefore , these animals were recorded as DCs.

The overall p ercentage of reactors (at standard interpretation) in Wales with TB infection confirmed by either DL or culture of M. bovis (29%) was lower than those observed in the High Risk Area (HRA) (43%) and Edge Area of England (39%). When comparing TB Areas in Wales, the H igh East TB Area (4 6%) was higher than the HRA of England (43%), with other TB Areas lower than Wales overall (High West; 24%, Area; 28%). The lower percentage s in Wales compared to the HRA and Edg e Areas in England could be due, in part at least, to the progress Wales has made due to the introduction of annual testing in 2010 . This means , particularly in the lower incidence areas, that infection is detected earlier in cattle before pathology has de veloped and can be detected during slaughterhouse inspection . Sixty per cent of the samples submitted from slaughterhouses in Wales were M. bovis positive, compared to 66% for Great Britain. This would support infection being detected earlier, in addition to more submissions in Wales coming from lesions not caused by M. bovis . Severe interpretation of the skin test is a more sensitive reading which leads to additional animals with a smaller response to the test being classified and slaughtered as reactors. This decreases the likelihood of truly infected animals testing negative to the skin test and therefore increases the likelihood of detecting all infected animals within the herd. A smaller percentage of these animals yield carcases with detectable lesion s (DL) from which M. bovis can be isolated and cultured compared with animals classed as reactors via standard interpretation . The percentage of samples with DLs that were M. bovis positive varied by TB Area and was highest in the High TB East Area and low est in the Low TB Area ( 96% and 67% respectively ; Tables 5.2.1 a-e). There was also variation in the percentage of M. bovis positive samples from NDLs, the highest in the Low TB area (3%) and the lowest in the High West, Intermediate North and Intermediate Mid TB Areas (all 1%). Overall in Wales, a larger percentage of samples from NDL animals had no culture results (pending or not cultured) compared with those from DL animals (76% vs. 50%). Half of 17 Animals having two successive tests giving inconclusive reactor measurements are generally considered to be skin test reactors, but may be described as \"IRs After 2 [or more] tests as IR\" to distinguish them from other reac tors in some parts of this report. IRs may be re -classified as reactors when interpreted severely. Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 124 samples from DL animals in 2019 were not cultured (or were pending ), although this was higher in DCs (64%) and IFN- reactors (68 %).

Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 129 By monitoring trends over time we can identify changes which might warra nt further investigation to see if they represent real changes in the underlying disease, changes in the testing regime, or changes in tuberculin sensitivity. The percentage of reactors with DLs has declined from around 21% in 2015 to around 13% in 2019 , which could be as a result of increased IFN -y testing (Figure 5.2.1) . The percentage of 1x IRs with DLs has declined since 2015 , as a result of many first time IRs in persistent TB incidents being removed (change in policy from 2016) . The percentage of DC' s, 2xIRs and 3xIRs increased slightly in 2019 (to 8% in 2018). In 2017 and 2018 there were no 3xIRs with DLs.

Usually only one culture positive sample is collected from each incident for genotyping by spoligotyping and VNTR typing (see Section 5.4). In addition, if the OTF status of the herd is withdrawn and a genotype is available, no furthe r sampling is undertaken from additional DL reactors and DCs. Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 130 Of the 528 DL samples from reactors with culture results in 2019, 91% were M. bovis positive . A similar percentage of DL samples with culture results were M. bovis positive in England1 in 201 9 (94% average ). This percentage has ranged in Wales from 86% to 97% since 2010 (mean = 93%; SD = 3%; Figure 5.3.1). A total of 2,115 NDL samples had culture results in 2019 . Twenty eight (1.3%) were confirmed to be M. bovis positive. Importantly however, this does not mean that the remaining 99% were not infected , since infected animals do not always have DLs or yield positive culture results. The earlier in the stages of disease that reactors to the TB test are identified , the less likely they are to have lesions and positive culture results. Since 2010 , there has been a gradual decline in the percentage of NDLs that were M. bovis positive , despite an increase in 2014 (Figure 5.3.1) . Of the 3,292 animals where both the lesion status and culture result was known (i.e. all DL and NDL animals with a positive or negative result and excluding all animals where lesion status was not known or where no cultures were carried out; excluding slaughterhouse cases), 608 (19%) had evidence of TB: either having detected lesions and/or being culture positive (i.e. all DL, and NDL animals with positive results only; Figure 5. 1.1). % of cultured samples M.bovis positive 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Year Proportion of DL with M. bovis Proportion of NDL with M. bovis % of DL with M. bovis - 12 month moving average % of NDL with M. bovis - 12 month moving average Figure 5.3.1: Monthly percentage of reactor culture samples from which M. bovis was obtained, 2010 - 2019 1 https://www.gov.uk/government/publ ications/bovine -tb-epidemiology -in-great of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 131 5.4Overview of the isolates in the spoligotype database (Wales only). The APHA has a database of genotypes for over 14,000 isolates of TB from Wales (1988 to end 2019 ). These genotyped isolates of M. bovis show clear geographical clustering. Since 2002 , the combination of spoligotype and th e Variable Number of Tandem Repeat (VNTR) profile is known for the majority of OTF -W incidents. In combination with home range maps , the genotype of M. bovis can help determine the origin of infection, in particular if the farmer has purchased animals from an area where the prevalent genotype differs from the local one. The current distribution o f cattle genotypes is shown in Figure 5.4.1 . The most frequently found isolates in 2019 were 9:b, located mostly in the High West TB Area, and 17:A, located predomi nantly in the High East TB Area (bordering the Intermediate North TB Area), although found in all TB Areas.

Full genotype (spoligotype plus 6 VNTR loci) was obtained for 95% of thes e isolates (2018 = 94%). The 359 cattle isolates with full genotype represent 324 separate incidents in cattle herds in Wales (2018 = 363). An average of 1.11 isolates were genotyped per TB incident (2018 = 1.08) [NB. One TB had different genotypes ]. and 22:a made up over 91% of Welsh isolates in 2019 and have home ranges in Wale s (Table 5.5.1) .

The overall total for 2018 was 296. The geographical distribution of the major spoligotypes ident ified in OTF -W incidents in 2019 is presented in Figure 5 .5.1. The most common spoligotype in Wales (spoligotype 9) had two main clusters: one in the south west corner of Wales and the other mainly located in Mid Powys. Spoligotype 9 is much less common over the border in England, where spoligotype 17 predominates. S poligotype 17 is the second most common type in Wales, with a large cluster seen in North Powys.

Forty three non-bovine isolates were genotyped in 2019 (2018 = 39). This total included 38 badger samples (2018 = 18 ), three deer and two goat (one incident) samples . The complete genotype was avai lable for thirty seven badger isolates, with six of the thirty seven being out of home range. Two of the three deer isolates with complete genotype were within home range and a single goat with complete genotype was within home range. As observed in Figur e 5.6.1 (which does not include badger isolates) , all non -bovine isolates were located in the High East TB Area .

Materials and Methods Data extraction and manipulation The data o n herds, animals, bovine tuberculosis (TB) incidents and tests applied to the British cattle population were downloaded from the Animal and Plant Health Agency's (APHA) SAM RADAR TB reception database on 2nd April 2020, and includes skin tests entered on t o SAM, APHA's TB surveillance management system, and completed on or before 28th March 20 20. Data prior to late September 2011 derives from the APHA VetNet system, which was migrated into SAM when that system went live at the end of September 2011. Informa tion relating to culture results of all TB suspect samples exists on SAM but is derived from the APHA's LIMS system and prior to that from the APHA TB Culture System (TBCS), plus a short cross -over period when both were in use. Apparent missing results data on SAM have been retrieved directly from LIMS where possible, in particular for samples from around the time of SAM TB going live. Data is downloaded three months after the reporting year in order to capture confirmation by culture of incidents commencin g in the reporting year. This date is, however, too early to capture all events during most of these incidents, for example the dates of removal of movement restrictions, from which the duration of incidents is calculated. Therefore, incidents that ended during the reporting year are used to calculate the duration of incidents and the total number of reactors in an incident. Since 2012 denominator herd numbers have been those active at the end of the reporting period rather than those in existence for 6 mon ths of it, to match methodologies of the National Statistics which may account for minor differences observed with reports prior to 2012. Data Issues To ensure only one herd incident is included for each herd, incidents are screened to determine duplicate, concurrent, and missing incidents. More than one incident on the same CPHH at the same time can exist in SAM, which we have attempted to eliminate. Incidents clearly missing from SAM, with reactors or lesions at tests but no incident apparently in existen ce on SAM, have been included, although these are now very few, as are duplicate and concurrent incidents. The status of incidents will also have been upgraded if post mortem results exist on LIMS, or the TBCS that have not been put onto SAM although again, this is now much less common than at the outset of SAM. Inaccurate or missing TB10 information, which mark the end of restrictions, had also been a serious issue within SAM and one addressed since the 2012 report. Revisions in SAM, policy changes an d user training have reduced most errors in this respect and the situation is greatly improved, although a very small number of incidents with obviously incorrect or missing TB10 dates may still get corrected for this report. It should be noted that manage ment of the closure of incidents involves the receipt of a BT5 form which provides evidence of cleansing and disinfection on the incident premises. This is required before a Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 139 TB10 can be issued to formally close the incident. Delays to the BT5 receipt, or n on- receipt at all will artificially prolong the duration of incidents, which in effect should last until the final clearing skin test. Policy introduced late in 2015 has attempted to penalise non - returners of the BT5 and the situation appears to be much im proved, although slow returns will artificially lengthen the incident duration. A similar delay can also be due to noted discrepancies within the BCMS Cattle Tracing System, whereby animals presented for testing on the farm do not all match the population reported in BCMS and which have to be corrected prior to the lifting of restrictions. Ongoing effort is being made to correct as much of the data inconsistencies as possible, and we are fairly confident we have used a dataset that is broadly correct. It is possible that future scrutiny of the data may uncover further minor corrections, but it is not envisaged that trends observed within this report will be significantly affected. Officially TB -free status terminology A full glossary of terms and abbreviations used in this report is given in Appendix 2. However, terms relating to the officially TB -free status of herds are frequently used throughout most sections of this report and therefore a clear understanding of their definitions is necessary. Bovine TB incidents with evidence of Mycobacterium bovis infection detected in at least one animal from the herd at post mortem examination (PME) or sample culture (including those triggered by slaughterhouse surveillance), as well as incidents where there is no evidence of infection at PME but there is epidemiological evidence that the herd is at high risk of being infected, are reported here as 'officially TB free status withdrawn (OTF -W)'. New TB incidents with no evidence of M. bovis infection detected a t PME or in sample culture, and with no epidemiological risk of infection, are referred to as 'officially TB free status suspended (OTF -S)'. Animals that are slaughterhouse cases must always have provided samples from which M. bovis is recovered. The numbe r of OTF -W and OTF -S incidents in this report may differ from other official TB statistics due to slight differences in data interpretation and the aforementioned data cleansing. Bovine TB incidents commence when one or more animal has a skin test or interferon -gamma results indicative of TB (a \"reactor\") , or when any infected animal is detected at slaughter. This report treats any slaughterhouse case first detected by lesion(s) disclosed at slaughterhouse surveillance from which M. bovis is isolated by culture, as being able to trigger an OTF -W incident if the herd of origin is not under restriction at the time the lesions were found, whether or not there are reactors found subsequently in the herd. The report uses cleaned incident data to ensure all genuin e incidents are included and concurrent incidents are counted only once; and ignores herds placed under restriction because their test is overdue . Unclassified incidents are those without results to determine the status of the incident. Some tables within the report reject these incidents; others combine them with the OTF -S incidents. These may be genuine incidents that are missing results, or begun as a result of Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 140 tracing or connection with another incident herd and thus not a regular incident. Attempts have been made to exclude those that do not appear to be genuine TB incidents. Calculations of incidence and prevalence Several methods are used in this report to describe the level of TB in Wales. The first is the number of new incidents that started in a given year , divided by the number of herds in Wales that were 'live' in that year (see Appendix 2 for definition of 'live herds'). This is reported as the number of new incidents per 100 live herds and is thus a measure of the percentage of Welsh herds th at sustained a new incident. This is the standard method of reporting TB incidence in GB. However, this method does not take into account the dates on which tests occur and can cause difficulties when making comparisons of incidence rates between populatio ns having differing testing intervals in the immediate past, although this is of less relevance in Wales where all areas are routinely tested annually. Consequently, the second method used to estimate the incidence of TB in Wales in this report calculates the number of new incidents relative to the 'herd time spent at risk'. The time at risk is calculated for each herd at each test or incident as the time spent not under restriction since the previous herd -level test. As all herds are tested annually in Wal es, the maximum time at risk expected would be around 12 months. If this time exceeds 18 months due to previous herd inactivity, then the time at risk for that herd is capped at 18 months. If a herd is not tested in a given year, it does not contribute to wards the incidence rate calculations for that year because detection of TB in the majority of animals in the herd was not possible aside from slaughterhouse surveillance. However, if a herd has more than one test and/or incident in a year , the respective times at risk are added together. It should be noted that all information regarding time at risk is based only on herd-level tests because the sensitivity of individual animal -level tests for determining the TB status of the herd is low. Thus , when a new i ncident is disclosed following an animal - level test, the accumulated time at risk is attributed to the incident, rather than being deferred until the planned but forestalled herd level test. The third method used to estimate the level of TB infection in c attle herds in Wales is concerned with the effect of the disease on the management of the herd at a single point in time, regardless of when infection entered the herd. That is, the total number of herds that are under movement restrictions due to a TB inc ident on a given date , divided by the total number of active herds at that point in time. This refers to prevalence of TB in a herd . As stated above, herds restricted due to an overdue test rather than a TB incident are not classified as 'restricted' in th is report and therefore estimates of the percentage of herds under restriction will be lower in this report than in some of the official TB statistics. Method for classification of recurrent -incident herds Recurrent TB is defined as a TB incident disclos ed during the Current Period occurring in a herd that was under restriction for TB at any time during the History Period . In this report, the Current Period refers to a new TB incident disclosed in 2019, and the History Period refers to any TB incident in the 36 months prior. A key date or Reference Date is first Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 141 calculated for each herd. It falls as near as possible to the middle Date in the Current Period (2nd July 20191), unless a TB incident starts in the Current Period. If there is one or more OTF -W in the Current Period, the Reference Date is day 1 of the disclosing test of the OTF -W nearest to the Middle Date of the Current Period; If there are no OTF -W incidents but one or more OTF -S in the Current Period, the Referen ce Date is day 1 of the disclosing test nearest to the Middle Date; If no TB incident is disclosed in the Current Period, the Reference Date is the Middle Date of the Current Period (2nd July). Where the herd is under movement restriction for four or more months at the start of the Current Period, recurrence cannot be defined and the herd is excluded from the analyses. The History Period is the 36 months ending on the day before the Reference Date. In this report, restrictions in the History Period end on the day of issue of a TB10 form. The three types of History Period are: (A), if the herd is under restriction on one or more days in the History Period for an OTF-W incident; (B), if at any time during the History Period, the herd is not under restrictio n for an OTF-W incident but is under restriction for an OTF -S incident; (C), if the herd is not under restriction for TB at any time during the History Period. There are also three types of Current Period : (1) if any OTF -W incidents start in the period; (2) if no OTF -W incidents start, but one or more OTF -S incident starts, and (2) if the herd remains OTF through the entire Current Period. Statistical analysis Statistical tests were performed where appropriate. For data in 2 x 2 tables, a Fisher's Exact tes t was used. Comparisons between the means of continuous variables where the variable was not normally distributed were performed using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. The Z -test was used to compare differences in percentage s. Univariate Linear (continuous out comes), Logistic (binary outcomes) and Poisson (count data) regressions were used to assess the associations between predictor variables such as herd size, herd type and geographical area and outcomes such as incidence and recurrence rates. The confounding effects of these predictor variables upon one another were adjusted by including all predictors in a multivariable model. However, the number of factors available for use in multivariable analysis was limited by the source data. 1 2nd July is actually day 183 of a 365 -day year or day 184 of a 366 -day year. Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 142 In Poisson regression anal yses, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) indicates the size of the difference between the different categories of herd size, type and TB Area, relative to the reference category For example, if a category had an IRR of 2.0, this means that the incidence rate i n herds within that category was twice as high as that of the reference category. An IRR of less than 1 represents categories where the incidence rate is lower than that of the reference category. Predictor variables were generally categorical; continuous variables were categorised. Categories were chosen based either on quantiles of the distribution of the population or (more often) biologically relevant categories. For example, for the predictor 'herd size', categories could ideally be based on either equ al numbers of herds or equal numbers of animals; as a result, the numbers of herds in the categories for large herd sizes tended to be smaller than for smaller herd sizes. The reference category chosen for categorical predictors in regression analyses vari ed. Ideally the reference category was both biologically relevant and had a sufficient number of observations or cases to be statistically sound. However, if the most biologically relevant category had insufficient observations/cases or there was no clear biological advantage in selecting a reference category, then the category with the most observations/cases was chosen. The odds ratios1 indicate the size of the difference in the odds of an incident being detected in the slaughterhouse between the differen t categories of each variable, relative to a reference category (see Materials and Methods for explanation of the choice of reference category). All data analyses were performed using Stata v12.0 or v14.0. OTF-W-2 herds The term 'officially tuberculosis free status withdrawn ' (OTF -W) is applied to a herd with a TB incident in which additional evidence of Mycobacterium bovis infection has been identified in at least one slaughtered animal (see Appendix 2 for more detail). This case definition has been used in previous iterations of the report and in the related reports for England and Great Britain. In January 2011 , changes were implemented in Wales that were designed to ensure that the officially tuberculosis free (OTF) status of cattle herds was withdrawn rather than merely suspended in cases of incidents that met defined epidemiological criteria. These criteria included ; herds with a pre -existing history of infection with bovine tuberculosis (TB), consideration of the local disease situation, where an add itional epidemiological risk is identified by the Animal and Plant Health Agency and since 2016 , all TB incidents with two or more reactors. This cohort has become known as OTF -W-2 herds. In common with 1 The 'odds ratio' in this case is the odds (probability) of an OTF -W incident being detected in the slaughterhouse, divided by the odds of an OTF -W incident being detected via routine skin testing. Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 143 other herds where OTF status is withdrawn (OTF -W), tw o consecutive clear herd tests are required to restore their OTF status rather than the single clear test required by herds with only a suspended OTF status (OTF -S). In reports prior to 2014, OTF -W-2 herds were difficult to identify within the data availab le for analysis, and so were included in the OTF -S cohort. These difficulties with the data have now been resolved and, as such, OTF -W-2 herds are now identified and included in the OTF -W cohort. This change has been applied retrospectively to the data for all incidents since the policy was introduced in 2011, so there will be some differences in the data presented in this report compared to the reports for 2011, 2012 and 2013. OTF -W-2 incidents are not reported as a distinct cohort anywhere within this rep ort. Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 144 Appendix 2. Definitions and abbreviations Appendix Table 1: Definitions of terms used throughout the report Detail Abbreviation Definition or description Animal and Plant Health Agency APHA The Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) was launched on the 1st October 2014. It merged the former Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency with the Plant and Bee Health and GM Inspectorates and the Plant Varieties and Seeds Office (previously based in Fera), creating a single agency responsible for animal, plant and bee health. Annualised Conversion of a variable into a yearly sum (e.g. by multiplying a quarterly incidence by 4). Antibody test IDEXX test An ancillary antibody detection blood test typically used in herds with persistent infection. The highest sensitivity of the test is dependent on a prior tuberculin skin test, which triggers an anamnestic boost to specific antibody levels in infected cattle. APHA recommend that blood samples are taken within 10 to 30 days of a prior skin test . Bovine tuberculosis TB Disease of cattle and other mammals caused by infection with Mycobacterium bovis. Contiguous herd Strictly speaking, a herd that has a common boundary with the herd of interest, but includes herds separated only by a short distance e .g. across a road or river, or where an epidemiological assessment indicates they are likely to be at risk of exposure to infection. Dangerous contact DC Animals in an OTF -W herd whilst not reactors are considered to be at such high risk of being infected that slaughter is justified, usually because of contact with infected cattle. Detected lesions DL Lesions typical of bovine TB detected in the carcass of a SICCT or IFN - test reactor at post mortem examination or during routine slaughterhouse inspection of cattle. Disclosing test The test that triggers the start of a new TB incident (OTF -S or OTF -W) which in turn marks the start of movement restriction s. For the purposes of analysis it includes the detection of a slaughterhouse case. Eradication programme1 Programme to result in biological extinction of an animal disease or zoonosis and -or to obtain the free or officially free -status of the territory according to EU legislation, where such possibility exists. Genotype The genotype currently used for the molecular epidemiology of TB in GB (and therefore Wales) is a combination of Spoligotype and VNTR type. Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 145 Detail Abbreviation Definition or description Health Check Wales HCW A surveillance initiative operating between 1st October 2008 and 31st December 2009 during which all herds in Wales were tested. Annual testing of herds has continued thereafter. Herd An animal or group of animals kept on a holding as an epidemiological unit. In GB they are identified with a County Parish Holding Herd (CPHH) number. Herd size For a TB incident, herd size is the largest size entered in SAM for a test conducted at any time during the incident. For officially TB free herds, herd size has been changed in 2017 to take a median size recorded on the BCMS Cattle Tracing Scheme for the holding over the most recent 12 months with a recorded size, and this has been supplemented for those holdings with more than one herd in existence at the same time or not pr esent in BCMS with the herd size recorded at the most recent whole herd test. Where no size is retrievable from either source , the typical number of animals indicated on SAM has been used. The change to using CTS was largely driven with the aim of reducing the numbers without a retrievable size from the testing history and where recent tests presented no eligible stock. Herd test A surveillance or control test triggered by a herd level event, rather than a test triggered for an individual animal. For exam ple, a routine herd test is a herd test applied because a regular surveillance test is due, whereas a pre -movement test is not a herd test. Herd years at risk The sum of the time (days, months or years) herds in the population are unrestricted and are th erefore at risk of a new incident , among the group of herds that have had a herd -level test during the period of interest. . Herd types 'Beef' includes Beef, Finishing, Suckler, Beef Dealer, Beef Heifer Rearer, Beef Bull Hirer and Stores herds 'Dairy ' includes Dairy, Dairy Dealer, Dairy Bull Hirer, Dairy Producer, Dairy Heifer Rearer , Flying and Domestic herds; 'Other' includes Calf Rearers, unspecified Dealer Herds, AI, buffalo herd and herds described on SAM as 'Other herds' and bred or reared for pro ducts other than beef or dairy . It may also include atypical herd premises such as temporary gatherings and quarantine facilities, although these are typically not subject to testing. Holding A holding is a place where livestock, including cattle, are ke pt or handled in pursuit of an agricultural activity. It may be a farm, or other premises such as a Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 146 Detail Abbreviation Definition or description market, lairage, abattoir or showground. Some keepers may have more than 1 holding and some holdings may be used by more than one keeper. A holding is not t he same as a business. It is expressed as a County Parish Holding (CPH number) and a single holding may comprise of one or more herds. Homerange The geographical area in which a genotype is most frequently recovered. A simple algorithm to define homerang e area for the common genotypes of M. bovis was developed as part of Defra Project SE3257. A 5 km square is considered as part of the homerange if there have been three different incidents of that genotype, on at least 2 holdings, within a 5 year window. A 10km buffer is then applied in order to create coherent homerange area for each genotype. Incidence For the purposes of this report, incidence is the ratio between the number of TB incidents detected (\"disclosed\") and a denominator for the population, which is either (a) the number of \"live or active\" herds regardless of whether they have been tuberculin tested, or (b) the total time that herds have been at risk of being detected with TB (i.e. accounts for testing history). Inconclusive reactor IR An animal showing a particular pattern of reactions to a comparative intradermal tuberculin test that uses bovine and avian reagents, where the difference in size of reactions to bovine and avian tuberculin is not large enough to cause it to be described as a reactor. In Wales, both standard and severe interpretation inconclusive reactors are recognised. Animals having two successive tests giving Inconclusive reactor measurements are generally considered to be skin test reactors, but may be described as \"IRs After 2 [or more] tests as IR\" to distinguish them from other reactors in some parts of this report. IRs may be re -classified as reactors when interpreted severely. Intensive Action Area IAA An area with high TB prevalence in North Pembrokeshire, adjacen t to Ceredigion, in which additional cattle control measures (including twice - yearly routine testing and enhanced testing for OTF -S incidents) have been applied since May 2010. Interferon -gamma test IFN- or gIFN Laboratory -based blood test used in parall el with the tuberculin skin test to improve the sensitivity of the testing regimen. The in vitro gamma -interferon (IFN -) assay is only approved as an ancillary diagnostic tool and measures the release of IFN - in whole blood cultures stimulated with tuberculin. Most frequently used to enhance the sensitivity of testing in OTF - withdrawn herds. Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 147 Detail Abbreviation Definition or description http://intrane t/v1p3r/workareas/Tuberculosis/Bovines/ Gamma_Test/Eligibility_in_Wales.html Inter-quartile range IQR A measure of statistical dispersion (equal to the difference between the upper and lower quartiles): referring to the 25th and 75th percentile of the med ian value described. Linear regression A statistical approach for modelling the relationship between a continuous outcome variable (e.g. restriction duration, which can take any value) and one or more 'predictor' variables (e.g. herd size, herd type or T B Area). Live herd or Active herd CPHH Bovine herd defined in the County/Parish/Holding/Herd notation which was flagged as active on SAM on 31st December, 2019. This does rely on a degree of accuracy of the activity dates given on SAM for herds. This gives different values from the Agricultural Census or the Cattle Tracing System (CTS) , as SAM gives separate data for each herd within a holding, is maintained continuously for all herds (not just by sample surveys), and represents all herds no matter how small. Delays in reflecting the true activity periods of herds in SAM, can affect the accuracy of SAM -derived estimates of numbers of herds. All herds reported in Section 1 refer to live/active herds according to SAM at the end of the reporting year. Logistic regression A statistical approach for modelling the relationship between a binary outcome variable (e.g. positive or negative result) and one or more 'predict or' variables (e.g. herd size, herd type or TB Area). Mycobacterium avium M. avium The causative organism of tuberculosis, occasionally infects cattle. Mycobacterium bovis M. bovis The causative organism of bovine tuberculosis. 1Monitoring pr ogramme Programme to investigate an animal population or subpopulation, and/or its environment (including wild reservoir and vectors), to detect changes in the occurrence and infection patterns of an animal disease or zoonosis. Movement restrictions / restrictions Prohibitions on the free movement of animals into and out of a herd. Movement restrictions may be imposed on a herd because of the presence, or the suspicion of the presence, of M. bovis infection or because statutory tests are overdue. Herd restrictions due to overdue tests are excluded from analyses in this report to avoid overestimates of disease. New TB incident A herd previously OTF in which at least one test reactor, IR taken as a reactor, or a culture -positive slaughterhouse case has been found. The restriction , Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 148 Detail Abbreviation Definition or description and thus the incident, begins on the disclosing test date and ends on the date that Form TB10 is issued. To qualify as being \"new\", the incident must have been disclosed in the period specified. No detected lesions NDL No lesions typical of bovine TB detected in the carcass of a SICCT or IFN - test reactor at post mortem examination or during routine slaughterhouse inspection of cattle. Officially bovine tuberculosis fr ee OTF See Appendix 3 for Extract from European Union (1998), Council Directive 98/46/EC for full definition of the officially TB free status. Officially bovine tuberculosis free status suspended OTF-S A TB incident where there is a suspicion of infection being present but no evidence of M.bovis infection has been identified , nor the herd perceived of being at greater epidemiological risk of being truly infected. A TB incident that did not meet the conditions for an OTF-W incident (see below) is classified as an OTF -S incident. Officially bovine tuberculosis free status withdrawn OTF-W A TB incident in which additional evidence of M. bovis infection has been identified in at least one slaughtered bovine animal, i.e. M. bovis identified in a cultured tissue sample and/or lesions detected in the carcass of a SICCT or IFN - test reactor. It also includes other TB incidents upgraded to OTF -W for epidemiological reasons. Persistent herd or persistent TB incident herd A TB incident herd that has been under movement restrictions for at least 550 days (approximately 18 months). Poisson regression A type of statistical modelling based on a particular type of numerical distribution that is used to compare rates of rare occurrences between different population groups, different areas, or different times. Post mortem examination PME Examination (to various extents) of the carcass and organs of slaughtered cattle for suspected lesions of bovine TB. Such post mortem examinations include s those undertaken at an APHA Regional Laboratory, those undertaken at the slaughterhouse following in vivo suspicion of infection (e.g. reactors, IRs and DCs), and those undertaken as part of routine meat inspection. Pre-movement testing PrMT or PRMT Mandatory testing for cattle over 42 days moving out of an at least annually tested herd into other herds and for cattle moved out of herds in the LRA to Scotland, unless the animal had spent its entire life in the LRA. Prevalence The proportion of active h erds under movement restrictions on a given date due to a TB incident, and excludes herds restricted due to an overdue test. Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 149 Detail Abbreviation Definition or description Reactor R An animal showing a particular pattern of reactions to a single intradermal tuberculin comparative test (SICCT test) or to a gamma interferon (IFN -) assay that uses bovine and avian reagents, or to an IDEXX Antibody test, and not including an animal first suspected to have TB at the slaughterhouse. An inconclusive reactor (IR) will be treated as a reactor if a retest yield s a second inconclusive result, but will not count towards statistics for reactors throughout this report. An animal reacting to more than one test will only count once to statistics, and hierarchically assigned to the SICCT, then IFN -, then IDEXX. Recur rent herd A herd that had a TB incident disclosed in the reporting year that had also been under movement restrictions for a different TB incident in the previous 36 months. Reference category Ref In regression analyses the reference group acts as a base line against which we compare other groups of interest. Risk Area On 1 January 2013, a new TB surveillance testing regime was introduced for bovine herds in England. TB testing intervals for bovines are now either on an annual or four yearly basis at co unty rather than parish level. In the England surveillance report, data is presented by risk area: High Risk Area (HRA - annual testing), Edge Area ( six monthly and annual testing) and Low Risk Area (LRA ; four yearly testing). In 2017 Wales adopted a reg ionalised approach to TB distinguishing five TB areas (Low TB Area, Intermediate TB Area North, Intermediate TB Area Mid, High TB Area West and High TB East)1 [see 'TB Area']. SAM database SAM APHA's TB control and surveillance system, which records details of herds, TB tests, TB incidents and the details of any slaughtered (reactors, slaughterhouse cases and direct contacts) and inconclusive reactor cattle. Sensitivity (of a test) Se The proportion of truly infected individuals in the screened population that are identified as infected by the test. Severe interpretation Using this interpretation of the comparative intradermal tuberculin test, animals showing either i) a positive bovine reaction and negative avian reaction or ii) a po sitive bovine reaction more than 2mm greater than a positive avian reaction are deemed reactors. 1 https://gov.wales/sites/default/files/publications/2017 -11/wales -bovine -tb-eradication -programme.pdf Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 150 Detail Abbreviation Definition or description Single Intradermal Comparative Cervical Test SICCT, tuberculin skin test, skin test Also commonly referred to as the 'skin test' or 'tuberculin skin test'. The testing procedure involves the simultaneous injection of a small amount of M. bovis and M. avium tuberculins (purified protein derivative (PPD); a crude extract of bacterial cell wall antigens), into two sites of the skin of the animal's neck, followed b y a comparative measurement of any swelling (delayed -type hypersensitivity reaction) which develops at the two injection sites after 72 hours. Slaughterhouse case SLH An incident (rather than an animal) that is triggered by the disclosure of an animal fr om an OTF herd that had lesions consistent with TB during routine post -mortem meat inspection. In order that the case becomes an OTF-W incident, M. bovis must be isolated on culture from samples of the lesions. Until M. bovis is isolated at culture, a slau ghterhouse case remains suspect and does not contribute to incident figures within this report, unless any subsequent skin check test performed in the herd of origin identifies reactors. 'Smoothed' and/or '12- month moving average' A 12-month moving ave rage is the average of the values for the current month and the previous 11 months. Moving averages can be any length. But, in general, shorter lengths will be best at identifying turning points and longer lengths best at identifying trends. Specificity ( of a test) Sp The proportion of truly uninfected individuals in the screened population who are identified as uninfected by the test. Spoligotype The result of one form of genomic typing of organisms of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis group described as Spacer Oligonucleotide typing. Standard deviation SD The standard deviation measures the spread of the data around the mean value. It is useful in comparing sets of data which may have the same mean but a different range of raw values. Standard interpretation Using this interpretation of the comparative intradermal tuberculin test, animals showing a positive bovine reaction more than 4mm greater than a negative or positive avian reaction are deemed reactors. Surveillance Surveillan ce refers to activities to collect and record data on specific diseases in defined populations over a period of time, in order to assess the epidemiological evolution of the diseases and the ability to take targeted measures for control and eradication. TB10 form The form issued at the end of a TB incident to lift the restrictions imposed on cattle movements onto and off the holding.

Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 156 Appendix 4. Extract from European Union (1998) , Council Directive 98/46/EC A bovine herd will retain officially tuberculosis -free status if: the conditions detailed in 1(a) and (c) [i.e. no clinical cases, no reactors at two tests six months apart, some controls on imports] continue to apply; - all animals entering the holding come from herds of officially tuberculosis - free status; - all animals on the holding, with the exception of calves under six weeks old which were born in the holding, are su bjected to routine tuberculin testing in accordance with Annex B at yearly intervals. However, the competent authority of a Member State may, for the Member State or part of the Member State where all the bovine herds are subject to an official programme t o combat tuberculosis, alter the frequency of the routine tests as follows: - if the average - determined at 31 December of each year - of the annual percentages of bovine herds confirmed as infected with tuberculosis is not more than 1 % of all herds within the defined area during the two most recent annual supervisory periods, the interval between routine herd tests may be increased to two years and male animals for fattening within an isolated epidemiological unit may be exempted from tuberculin testing pr ovided that they come from officially tuberculosis -free herds and that the competent authority guarantees that the males for fattening will not be used for breeding and will go direct for slaughter, - if the average - determined at 31 December of each year - of the annual percentages of bovine herds confirmed as infected with tuberculosis is not more than 0,2 % of all herds within the defined area during the two most recent biennial supervisory periods, the interval between routine tests may be increased to t hree years and/or the age at which animals have to undergo these tests may be increased to 24 months, - if the average - determined at 31 December of each year - of the annual percentages of bovine herds confirmed as infected with tuberculosis is not more th an 0,1 % of all herds within the defined area during the two most recent supervisory triennial periods, the interval between routine tests may be increased to four years, or, providing the following conditions are met, the competent authority may dispense with tuberculin testing of the herds: Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 157 before the introduction into the herd all the bovine animals are subjected to an intradermal tuberculin test with negative results; all bovine animals slaughtered are examined for lesions of tuberculosis and any such lesions are submitted to a histopathological and bacteriological examination for evidence of tuberculosis. The competent authority may also, in respect of th e Member State or a part thereof, increase the frequency of tuberculin testing if the level of the disease has increased. Project SB4500 Epidemiology of TB in Wales: Report for 20 19 Page 158 Appendix 5. Geographical areas used in this report There is a need to describe the bovine TB epidemic in Wales at some geographical level above that of the 'parish' but below that of 'Wales'. Previously the data in this report were presented at a county level, derived from the 'CP' component of the County Parish Holding Herd (CPHH) identifier used for cattle herd data. This report now presents data according to the five \"TB Areas\" of Wales. This reflects the regionalised approach to TB eradication established through the refreshed TB Eradication Programme, launched in October 2017. The Wales TB Areas are themselves comprised of 58 Spatial Units (Appendix Figure 1). Spatial units are compatible with the CPHH system and each contain a similar number of herds. The splitting of Wales into a number of TB Areas r eflects the need to recognise the differing disease situations. The approach to disease control in each area reflects the prevailing local circumstances and measures are developed that are best suited to make a difference to disease in those areas. Six-year interim regional milestones have been set according to improvements in herd incidence at regional level and the transfer of Spatial Units from higher to lower incidence areas. The national eradication target emerges on the basis of the regional targets b eing achieved. Further information on the TB eradication targets for Wales is available on the Welsh Government website .
