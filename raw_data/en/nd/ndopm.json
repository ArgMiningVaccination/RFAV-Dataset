Overview Our research team has had a major role in the study concept and planning and is functioning as the I4C International Data Coordinating Centre. Data is being pooled and analysed to the examine environmental and genetic factors that differ between those children who get cancer and those who don't. How we started The Director of the I4C International Coordinating Centre, [Professor Terry Dwyer](/researcher-details/terry-dwyer), was tasked in 2004 with leading an evaluation of whether the [National Children's Study (NCS)](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/research/NCS/Pages/default.aspx), a childhood cohort of 100,000 participants, would be sufficiently sized to include cancer as a workable outcome. These discussions led to the conclusion that the NCS alone would not have sufficient power to examine childhood cancers, given their rarity. However, it was agreed that a collaboration of existing and planned large cohorts may provide the power to get prospective evidence on the potential causes of childhood cancers. We held a workshop on September 28-29, 2005, in Rockville, MD, USA, to discuss the development of an international alliance of longitudinal studies of children. Research teams from 15 countries spanning four continents, representing approximately 700,000 children, agreed to a collaboration leading to the establishment of the International Childhood Cancer Cohort Consortium (I4C). Our meetings 13th International Childhood Cancer Cohort Consortium (I4C) meeting We held two live webinars over Wednesday 23rd/Thursday 24th February 2022. Sessions included: - Recent findings from I4C - Maternal infection and risk of childhood leukemia - presented by Jianrong (Jeff) He. - Mediation analysis in life-course studies - presented by Bianca de Stavola. - Advances in measuring ETV6-RUNX1 translocations in cord blood - presented by Arndt Borkhardt. - Recent findings from I4C - Maternal infection and risk of childhood leukemia - presented by Jianrong (Jeff) He. - Recent findings in epigenetics on the aetiology of childhood leukemia - presented by Joseph Wiemels. - Adv A strategy for investigating the causes of childhood cancer in China - presented by Yawei Zhang. 12th International Childhood Cancer Cohort Consortium (I4C) meeting 2020/2021 Held in on line February 2021 due to the impact of the COVID-19.
