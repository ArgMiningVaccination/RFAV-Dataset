[insomnia](https://www.goodpath.com/learn/conditions/sleep) can feel very lonely. In fact, it's a very [common](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1978319/) condition. Studies in several countries have shown that approximately 30% of adults experience one or more of the symptoms of insomnia. And, of course, it causes problems at bedtime and during the night. If that isn't enough, it often interferes with daily activities and can make life quite difficult. For instance, people with insomnia are 2.5 to 4.5 times more likely to have an accident! Additionally, their work productivity is compromised due to work-related problems (ie, higher rates of absenteeism, decreased concentration, and difficulty performing duties). There are many different solutions for treating insomnia. Goodpath's integrative and personalized approach to treat insomnia uses the treatments below and more. To see which of these treatments is right for you, [take the sleep assessment](https://www.goodpath.com/conditions/sleep). What Is Insomnia? Regardless, it means that a person isn't getting quality or good sleep and they don't feel well-rested. Acute vs. Chronic Insomnia Treatment varies based on the length of time a person has had insomnia. Insomnia may be short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic). Acute insomnia means the trouble sleeping has occurred at least 3 nights per week and has been present for less than 3 months. Chronic insomnia also means it has occurred at least 3 nights a week, but the difference is it has been present for 3 months or more. Treatment for Acute and Chronic Insomnia Treatment for acute insomnia may be simpler than chronic insomnia. As an example, an herbal remedy and breathing exercises might be all that is needed to treat it in the short-term. For chronic insomnia, the treatment is often more complex. An example of treatment might be an herbal remedy, over-the-counter medicine, use of a sleep diary, and therapy. A special type of therapy called [cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia](https://www.goodpath.com/learn/cbti-insomnia-treatment-program) (CBT-I) is often recommended for chronic insomnia.

Diphenhydramine and doxylamine succinate are both antihistamines. They are available as generic or store brand products, which usually cost less. They may be used for allergy symptoms like sneezing or itching. But, both medicines have the side effect of drowsiness. That is how they help with sleep. Because they cause sleepiness, both medicines must be used carefully. They should not be taken before driving, operating machines, or when taking part in other activities requiring alertness.

Both are available as generic and store brand products, which are usually less expensive. Again, both medicines should be used with caution in those more than 65 years of age. Those with liver problems should not take acetaminophen without first talking with their doctors. And, those with bleeding problems should talk with their doctors before taking products with ibuprofen.
