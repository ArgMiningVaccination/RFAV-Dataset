Feng Shui, which literally means \"wind and water,\" is a practice which factors in the interior and exterior environment, compass directions, the Five Elements, and the theories of Yin and Yang in order to optimize the flow of Qi, or life force, in a room, building or landscape. This not only harmonizes humanity and architecture with nature, but also balances the energy of a site so that its occupants experience greater happiness, health, and even prosperity. Learning Feng Shui Feng Shui school graduates often come from professions such as interior design, landscape design, and [holistic health](https://www.naturalhealers.com/holistic-health/career-boom/). Feng Shui training enables practitioners to create healthy environments for their clients\u2014environments that improve the flow of positive Qi and reduce blockages to natural energy flow. The characteristics of an optimal environment vary depending on the individual client and the setting in question, so Feng Shui practitioners usually consult with clients on-site at their homes or workplaces.
