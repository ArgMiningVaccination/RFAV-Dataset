Moghadas1 Received: 23 June 2018 / Revised: 16 August 2019 / Published online: 7 September 2019 \u00a9 The Author(s) 2019 Abstract The use of multiple vaccine doses has proven to be essential in providing high levels of protection against a number of vaccine-preventable diseases at the individual level.However, the effectiveness of vaccination at the population level depends on several key factors, including the dose-dependent protection efcacy of vaccine, coverage of primary and booster doses, and in particular, the timing of a booster dose. For vaccinesthat provide transient protection, the optimal scheduling of a booster dose remains an important component of immunization programs and could signicantly affect the long-term disease dynamics. In this study, we developed a vaccination model as a sys-tem of delay differential equations to investigate the effect of booster schedule using a control parameter represented by a xed time-delay. By exploring the stability anal- ysis of the model based on its reproduction number, we show the disease persistencein scenarios where the booster dose is sub-optimally scheduled. The ndings indicate that, depending on the protection efcacy of primary vaccine series and the coverage of booster vaccination, the time-delay in a booster schedule can be a determining fac- tor in disease persistence or elimination. We present model results with simulations for a vaccine-preventable bacterial disease, Heamophilus influenzae serotype b, using parameter estimates from the previous literature. Our study highlights the importance of timelines for multiple-dose vaccination in order to enhance the population-wide benets of herd immunity. \u00b7Reproduction support of NKFIH Grant FK124016 and the Ministry of Human Capacities, Hungary Grant 20391-3/2018/FEKUSTRA T.

Conferring high levels of protection against a number of vaccine-preventable diseases requires more than one dose of vaccine that may be offered at different ages according to specic schedules set by vaccination programs (Jackson et al. 2012 ; Riolo et al. 2013 ; Riolo and Rohani 2015 ). For instance, vaccine schedules against Haemophilus influenzae serotype b (Hib) recommended for infants includes either 3 primary doses without a booster, or 2 to 3 primary doses plus a booster given at least 6 months after completing the primary series (World Health Organizationet al. 2016 ). However, even in the presence of booster doses, resurgence and outbreaks of some vaccine-preventable diseases still occur, notwithstanding substantial levels of routine primary vaccine series (Jackson et al. 2012 ; Riolo et al. 2013 ; Riolo and Rohani 2015 ). Reduced effectiveness of vaccination has been explicated for the occurrence of such outbreaks due to factors associated with incomplete protection efcacy of primary vaccine series, inadequate coverage of booster doses, waning immunity over time, andthe duration of vaccine-induced protection that may be signicantly shorter than the average lifetime of the population (Alexander et al. 2006 ; Riolo and Rohani 2015 ). While the importance of age-at-vaccination and booster doses has been docu- mented, the optimal vaccine schedules remains unclear for several vaccine-preventable diseases and scheduling is mainly determined based on epidemiological context in individual settings (Low et al. 2013 ; Jackson et al. 2013 ; Riolo and Rohani 2015 ). The diversity of booster dose schedules observed in immunization programs worldwide could have a signicant impact on disease elimination, since the scheduling may also affect the uptake rates of booster vaccination (Fitzwater et al. 2010 ). This poses a particular challenge for public health immunization programs in the context of defer- ral and subsequent refusal of booster doses that diminish the herd immunity (Omeret al. 2009 ; Dub\u00e9 et al. 2013 ;B r i e r ee ta l . 2014 ), and could lead to disease resurgence. Identication of the optimal booster schedule is therefore an important component of vaccination policies. Despite the importance of dosing interval between primary and booster vaccina- tion, a theoretical framework to investigate the impact of such interval and varying vaccination schedules on disease dynamics in the population is currently lacking. Inthis study, we aimed to establish this framework by developing a vaccination model, represented by a system of delay differential equations that describe the dynamics of disease transmission. Using this system, we evaluated the effect of delay in boosterdose after primary vaccination on the long-term disease prevalence. We incorporated a number of key parameters into the model including the protection efcacy of primary vaccination, duration of vaccine-induced protection, and the coverages of primary andbooster vaccination. We considered the delay as a control parameter, and analyzed the transient and steady-state behaviours of the system, in addition to determining the effect of time interval between primary and booster doses on disease elimination and 123Delay in booster schedule as a control parameter in vaccination... 2159 persistence. We show, by means of simulations, that the threshold of disease control depends critically on the parameter of delay in booster dose for a given protection efcacy of primary vaccination. To study the dynamics of our vaccination model, we rst propose a basic framework without vaccination, derive the basic reproduction number ( R0), and prove a threshold result for disease elimination in terms of R0. We then construct the general model by incorporating primary and booster vaccination into the basic framework, and analyze its behaviour. Stability of the disease-free equilibrium is investigated, and represented in terms of the control reproduction number ( Rc). When Rc>1, we show the uni- form persistence, indicating that the disease elimination is infeasible. Finally, we use parameter values estimated for a bacterial disease, Heamophilus influenzae serotype b (Hib), and perform simulations to illustrate the model results by varying time intervalbetween primary and booster doses, represented by the delay parameter. 2 Thebasicframework To develop the basic framework, we divided a population of constant size Ninto several compartments to represent the epidemiological statuses of individuals as susceptible (S), infectious ( I), recovered and fully protected ( R), and partially protected ( W, and Rw). The distinction between the two classes Wand Rwis based on the consideration that partial protection following natural infection may last for a certain period of time (on average) before declining towards negligible levels. We assumed a xedduration of full protection following recovery from infection. Once this period has elapsed, individuals will have only partial protection, and may become infected at a reduced rate compared with fully susceptible individuals. The duration of partialprotection is divided into a period of xed length (for those in the Wclass), followed by an exponentially distributed period of waning immunity (for those in the R wclass) leading to full susceptibility. Due to the xed periods of full and partial protection, the dynamics of disease transmission can be expressed by the following set of is the baseline transmission rate; is the recovery rate of infectious individ- uals,is the reduction of susceptibility to infection due to partial protection, is the natural death rate (assumed to be the same as the birth rate), rrepresents the xed duration of full protection, wrepresents the xed duration of partial protection; and 1232160 Z.

Thus, r(t,a)andw(t,a)represent the density, with respect to age aat time t,o f recovered individuals having full protection, and those having partial protection during the xed period before moving to the exponentially distributed period, respectively. Using the above notation, we have we used the notation =/N. Note that system ( 1) includes integral and differential equations. By differentiating the Rand Wequations in ( 1) with respect to t, we obtain the following model, which together with ( 3), constitutes a closed system of delay differential equations: 123Delay in booster schedule as a S/prime(t)=NSIS+Rw, I/prime(t)=SI+WI+RwIII, R/prime(t)=IRr(t,r), W/prime(t)=r(t,r)WIWw(t,w), can the population N(t)=S(t)+I(t)+R(t)+W(t)+Rw(t) is indeed constant. Let=r+w, and denote by Cthe Banach space C([,0],R5)of continuous with the norm: /bardbl/bardbl= sup [,0]|()|, where Cand|\u00b7|is for all [ ,0]. We choose the initial conditions for system ( 4) from the that system ( 4) is well-posed in , and the solution semiflow admits a global attractor on . Theorem 2.1 For any ,s y s t e m (4)has a unique non-negative solution u (t,) satisfying u 0=and u tfor all t >0, and the solution semiflow (t)=ut(\u00b7): has a compact global attractor. Moreover, the solutions of system (4)with initial conditions in satisfy the integro-differential equations system (1). Proof We start with the last assertion. From the third equation of ( 4), we have: eh a v e : Similarly, by integrating using the initial aI(u)duI(ra)da,t h e differential equation W/prime(t)in : W(t)=/integraldisplayw 0I(tra)e( r+a)/integraldisplayt 4) can be written as u/prime(t)=G(ut). We show that G() is Lipschitzian inwithin each compact set in C, that is for all M>0 there is a K>0 such that for all ,Cwith/bardbl/bardbl Mand/bardbl/bardbl M, the inequality |G()G()|K/bardbl/bardbl holds. We note that there are terms of linear, quadratic and exponential types in G. Quadratic terms are all Lipschitzian, and one can see that: |1(0)2(0)1(0)2(0)||1(0)2(0)1(0)2(0)| +|1(0)2(0)1(0)2(0)| 2M/bardbl/bardbl. 123Delay in booster schedule as a control parameter in vaccination... 2163 The Lipschitzian property for the most involved term can mean value theorem exey=e(xy). Hence, there is a unique solution of the system through (0,) on its maximal interval of existence [0,).W e note from ( 4) that any solution satises: I(t)=I(0)e/integraltextt 0S(u)+W(u)+Rw(u)du, (8) and hence if I(0)0, then I(t)0 for all t(0,).F r o m( 6) and ( 7), we nd that RandWare non-negative. Then the non-negativity Sand the S/prime(t)NSIS, and R/prime w(t)RwIRwRw. The non-negativity and relations ( 6) and ( 7) ensure that is forward invariant. Since the total population is constant, it follows that S(t)and I(t)are bounded by Nand the solutions exist globally. Therefore, solution semiflow (t)=ut(\u00b7): is point dissipative. By Theorem 3.6.1 Thus, from Theorem 3.4.8 in Hale ( 1988 ), it follows that (t)has a compact global attractor in . /intersectionsq/unionsq 2.1 Basic reproduction number The basic reproduction number ( R0) is the average number of new infected individ- uals generated by a single infected individual introduced into an entirely susceptible population, during the course of infection. According to the theory of epidemics, weexpect that the disease will vanish if R 0<1, while it will persist in the population ifR0>1. New infections occur only in the Sclass with the rate I. In a fully sus- ceptible population, S/N1 and the average length of infection is (+)1, and therefore we dene the basic reproduction number as R0=/(+). We proceed by presenting the threshold dynamics for system ( 4), which determines whether the disease dies out or persists. 1232164 Z. Wang et al. 2.2 Threshold dynamics It is clear that system ( 4) has a unique disease-free equilibrium E0=(N,0,0,0,0). We rst show that E0is globally asymptotically stable when R0<1. Then we establish the uniform persistence of the disease when R0>1 using techniques of persistence theory (Smith and Thieme 2011 ). Theorem 2.2 IfR0<1, then the disease-free Proof system: u/prime(t)=A1u(t)+A2u(tr)+A3u(trw), (9) where u(t)=(S(t),I(t),R(t),W(t),Rw(t))T, and A1= 00 0 00 0 0 00 000 0 000 0 (+) , A 2=(A2)ij,1i,j5, with (A2)32=er,(A2)42=erand all with (A3)42=e( r+w), (A3)52=e( r+w)and all other components are zero. The characteristic equation of system ( 9) has the form: det(IA1erA2e(r+w)A3)=0, which gives (+)3(++)(++)=0. Since R0<1, we have (+) < 0, which implies that E0is asymptotically stable. Now we prove that E0is globally attractive in . We consider the following inequal- ity: I/prime(t)(S+W+Rw)I(+)I(R01)(+)I. Thus, I(t)I(0)e(R01)(+)t, and hence I(t)0a s t .F r o m( 6) and (7), we nd that R(t)and W(t)are also converging to zero. For any /epsilon1> 0, and a sufciently large t>0, we have w(t,w)</epsilon1 , and the following inequality holds: R/prime w(t)/epsilon1(+)Rw. This means that lim sup tRw(t)/epsilon1 +, and therefore Rw0a s t . Since the total population is constant, we obtain that S(t)Nast . Thus, limtu(t,)= (N,0,0,0,0), and we conclude that E0is globally asymptotically stable. /intersectionsq/unionsq 123Delay in booster schedule as a control parameter in vaccination... 2165 We now prove the persistence of disease for R0>1. Considering the semiflow on, we dene the called the extinction space corresponding to P(that is the collection of states where the disease is not present). From the relation ( 8), it follows that the sets 0and+are forward invariant under the semiflow . We now introduce some terminology from persistence theory (Smith and Thieme 2011 , Chapters 3.1 and 8.3). Denition 2.3 LetXbe nonempty set and P:X R+. 1.

Proof First we show that E0is weakly P-repelling. Suppose that there exists 0 such that P(0)> 0 with limt(t, 0)=E0. (10) For such a solution, I(0)> 0 and lim t I(t)=0. Let /epsilon1> 0 small so that R0(1 /epsilon1 et al.

Hence, E0is weakly P-repelling. Notice that whenever I(t)0, from ( 6) and ( 7)w eh a and consequently Rw0 and SNast . Therefore 0()={E0}, and one can see from Theorem 8.17 in Smith and Thieme ( 2011 ) thatis uniformly weakly P-persistent. Since has a compact global attractor on , we can apply Theorem 4.5 in Smith and Thieme ( 2011 ) that is uniformly P-persistent. /intersectionsq/unionsq Theorems 2.2and 2.4indicate that the disease dynamics are completely determined by the basic reproduction number R0. In the following, we extend our model by introducing the primary and booster vaccination, and analyze the persistence dynamics of the resulting system. 3 Thegeneralvaccinationmodel The vaccination model includes additional classes of individuals who are vaccinatedwith primary series; partially protected following primary vaccination; and fully pro- tected following booster vaccination (See Table 1). A schematic diagram for timelines of primary and booster vaccination with delays is represented in Fig. 2. We assume that a fraction pof newborns will receive primary vaccine series in the rst speriod of their life. The remaining fraction of newborns will be recruited to the susceptible class and can therefore become infected through contacts with infectious individu-als. The primary vaccination is assumed to provide partial protection for a certain period of time during which infection can occur with a lower rate compared with fully susceptible individuals. We also assume that partial protection induced by primary vaccine gradually wanes over time, and individuals who forgo booster vaccination will eventually become susceptible. Similar to the basic framework, we consider axed duration of partial protection after primary vaccination, followed by an expo- nentially distributed period of waning immunity leading to full susceptibility. Those who have received primary vaccination may also receive booster dose. We assumethat, similar to recovery from infection, booster vaccination provides a xed duration of full protection, followed by xed and exponentially distributed durations of partial protection. 123Delay in booster schedule as a control parameter in vaccination... 2167 dp sbirthloss of partial protection fully susceptible booster vaccinationvs(t,a) vp(t,a) vd(t,a) Vw primary vaccination b w vb(t,a) w(t,a) loss of full protection 1 rI r(t,a) infection recovery Fig. 2 Schematic diagram for timelines of primary and booster vaccination with delay, and durations of vaccine-induced and naturally acquired protection In order to mathematically express the model, we let arepresent the age since the individuals enter each class, and dene vs(t,a),vp(t,a), andvd(t,a)to represent the density, with respect to age aat current time t, of primary vaccinated individuals, those who are partially protected as a result of primary vaccination and eligible toreceive booster dose, and those who are partially protected by primary vaccination and will not receive booster dose, respectively. Let p(0pw) represent the delay in receiving booster vaccination within the xed period of partial protectionfollowing primary vaccination. For those who will not receive the booster, we denote by dthe remaining period of time within the xed duration of partial protection, i.e., p+d=w. Description of all model parameters are provided in Table 2. With the above notation, the model can be expressed by the following system et al.

(17) In this model, we considered a single class Vwfor partially protected individuals with exponentially distributed duration of protection, regardless of whether the immu-nity was conferred by vaccination or natural infection. Thus, the R wclass from the basic framework is included in the Vwclass in the vaccination model. Solving along Rin (11) and substi- tuting the density functions, we obtain the following system that the equations of Vband Rare decoupled from the rest of the model. In the following, we show that ( 19) is well-posed, and further dene the disease- free equilibrium and the control reproduction number. Let c=max{s+p+b+ w,r+w}. We choose the initial conditions for system ( 19) from the set X, which any X,s y s t e m( 19) has a unique non-negative solution U (t,) satisfying U 0=and U tX, and the solution semiflow (t)=Ut(\u00b7):X X has a compact global attractor. Moreover, the solutions of system ( 19) with initial conditions in Xsatisfy the integro-differential equations system (11). Proof The proof is similar to Theorem 2.1. /intersectionsq/unionsq 123Delay in booster schedule as a control parameter in vaccination... 2171 3.1 Reproduction number Recall that in the absence of vaccination, system ( 19) reduces to ( 4) and the basic repro- duction number is given by R0=/(+). Letting I(t)0, we 19)a tE 0, we obtain the for the infection class: I/prime(t)=[S+V s+(V p+V d+V w+W)]I(+)I. (21) We now introduce the reproduction number following the idea in (Xu and Zhao 2012 ). Denote by x0the number of infectious individuals at time t=0, and x1(t)be the remaining population at time t. Thus, x1(t)=x0e(+)t. Thus, from ( 21), the total number of Wang et al. which can be interpreted as the total number of new infections generated by a single infectious individual in all non-infection classes during the average infectious period 1/(+). 3.2 Threshold dynamics 3.2.1 Local stability Here, we show disease elimination for sufciently small I(corresponding to solutions in a small neighbourhood of E 0)i f Rc<1. Notice that Vband Rin system ( 19) are independent of other state variables.

All matrices Dj,j=1,... 9, that appear in ( 23) can also be derived from ( 19) and (22). 123Delay in booster schedule as a control parameter in vaccination... 2173 Theorem 3.2 IfRc<1, then the disease-free equilibrium E 0of system ( 19) is locally asymptotically stable. Proof The characteristic equation of the linearized system at E 0is det/bracketleftBig D+esD1+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+ e( to 3(+)5(++)((+)( Rc1))=0. Since Rc<1, the local stability of E 0is proven. /intersectionsq/unionsq Remark 3.3 We have not been able to establish the global stability of E 0when Rc<1. There are some vaccination models that exhibit the phenomenon of backward bifur-cation, where a stable endemic equilibrium co-exists with the stable disease-free equilibrium Gumel ( 2002 ). However, based on the simulation results presented in the next section, we conjecture that Theorem 3.2holds for the entire domain of system (19) and E 0is globally stable. 3.2.2 Uniform persistence In this section, we prove the disease persistence when Rc>1. Consider the semiflow (t)inX, dened by the unique global space corresponding to P(i.e., X0is the collection of states without disease presence). From Theorem 3.1, it follows that X0and X+are forward invariant semiflow then the semiflow is uniformly P-persistent, i.e. there is a > 0such that for any solution lim inf t I(t). Proof First we show that E 0is weakly P-repelling. Suppose that there exists 0X such that P(0)> 0 with limt(t, 0)=E 0. (24) 1232174 Z. Wang et al. For such a solution, I(0)> 0 and lim t I(t)=0. For sufciently small /epsilon1> 0, we have Rc6/epsilon1 +>1. for of Ito zero. Thus, E 0is weakly P-repelling. We also note that whenever I(t)0, from the Requation in ( 11) X0() ={E 0}, and one can see that is uniformly weakly P-persistent (Smith and Thieme 2011 , Theorem 8.17). Since has a compact global attractor on X, the application of Theorem 4.5 in Smith and Thieme ( 2011 ) guarantees that is uniformly P-persistent. /intersectionsq/unionsq Remark 3.5 It is expected that an endemic equilibrium exists when the disease is uniformly persistent. Due to the exponential terms in the model, it is not possible to derive an explicit formula for the components of an endemic equilibrium, and we couldnot prove the existence or uniqueness of such equilibrium using established methods (such as xed point arguments). However, our numerical experiments suggest that there is a unique endemic equilibrium that emerges as R cincreases and passes the threshold of one. Regarding its stability, it is known that SIRS models with delay can exhibit periodic oscillations Hethcote et al. ( 1981 ), and their endemic equilibria can either be stable or unstable. For our model, a linear stability analysis seems very difcult to conduct due to the various delay terms. In numerical simulations, however, we can readily nd a combination of parameter values for which the vaccination model(19) exhibits sustained oscillations in the disease prevalence. This typically occurs for a small vaccination coverage, and increasing this coverage rst stabilizes the endemic equilibrium, and then can lead to disease elimination when it is sufciently high tobring R cless than one. 4 Simulationresults To illustrate the effect of booster schedule on the dynamics of disease spread in the population, we simulated the model while varying the protection efcacy of primary vaccination and the coverage of booster vaccination. For the simulation results pre-sented here, we used parameter values estimated for Haemophilus influenzae serotype b (Hib) in the published literature. Primary vaccination for Hib in most routine infant immunization programs includes 2 to 3 doses of vaccine offered between 2 to 6 monthsof age (World Health Organization et al. 2016 ), and we therefore assumed s=6 months for completion of primary series. Primary vaccination is estimated to provide partial protection for a xed duration of w=4 years, followed by an exponentially 123Delay in booster schedule as a control parameter in vaccination... 2175 distributed time period with the average of 1 /=6 years (Konini and Moghadas 2015 ; Jackson et al. 2012 ). Booster vaccination provides full protection for a xed period of b=6 years (Konini et al. 2016 ; Leino et al. 2000 ). We assumed that, after the period of full protection has elapsed, partial protection follows the same timelines as primary vaccination. Similar to booster vaccination, we assumed that recovery from infection provides full protection for a xed period of r=4 years (Konini and Moghadas 2015 ). Infection in the form of carriage (i.e., asymptomatic without showing clinical symptoms) contributes more signicantly to the incidence of Hib compared to symp- tomatic disease, and has a prolonged infectious period from several days to severalweeks (Leino et al. 2000 ; Jackson et al. 2012 ). We therefore assumed an average infectious period of 1 /=50 days. For the purpose of simulations, we used a population of size N=100,000 with an average lifetime of 1 /=70 years. The transmission parameter was calcu- lated based on a given basic reproduction number, while xing other parameters of the model. We assumed R 0=1.2 in the range 1.1-1.4 estimated in studies of Hib (Farrington et al. 2001 ) and other pathogens that cause bacterial meningitis, such as Neisseria meningitidis serotype C (Stephens 2011 ). We xed the coverage of primary vaccine at p=0.9, and varied the protection efcacy of primary vaccination, reflected in the reduction of susceptibility to infection. We ran the simulations while changing the time for booster vaccination within the xed period of partial protection followingprimary vaccination, that is, 0 < pw=4 years. We also simulated Rcas a function of two model parameters, namely the protection efcacy of primary vaccination ( ), and the time for booster vaccination following primary series ( p). For these simulations, we considered the coverage of booster vaccination as a function of pin three different scenarios: (i) Fixed coverage of booster vaccination: =0.95 (Fig. 3, solid line). (ii) Exponentially declining coverage of booster vaccination: ( p)=0.95e0.001p. This coverage reduces as the time delay pin booster vaccination increases (Fig. 3, dashed line). (iii) Inverted logistic declining coverage of booster vaccination: ( p)=14.2307 e0.006p 0.1+e0.006(p450). This coverage reduces with time delay pin booster vaccination in a functional form similar to van Genuchten-Gupta model (Fig. 3, dotted line). Figure 4shows the variation in Rccorresponding to the scenarios of booster cover- age. For a xed coverage of booster vaccination ( =0.95), Fig. 4a shows that when the protection efcacy of primary vaccination is sufciently high (approximately above70%), R cdecreases with increasing delay in booster schedule following primary vac- cination, and the disease can be eliminated if Rc<1 (in the region to the left side of the white line). When primary vaccination provides a protection efcacy that is 1232176 Z.

Solid line corresponds to a xed coverage; dashed line represents the exponentially declining boostercoverage; and dotted line illustrates an inverted logistic coverage of booster vaccination declining over time nearly as good as that conferred by the booster dose (i.e., > 0.9), the disease can be eliminated regardless of the time for booster schedule. However, for a moderate tolow protection efcacy of primary vaccination, the delay in booster vaccination has little or no effect in reducing R cand the disease persists in the population. When the coverage of booster vaccination declines exponentially, we observed lower Rcfor early booster schedule, regardless of the protection efcacy of primary vaccination (Fig. 4b). In our simulations, disease elimination can occur with a protec- tion efcacy above 90%, but requires booster vaccination within 12 months followingthe primary vaccination (i.e., the region below the white line in Fig. 4b). In contrast to the scenario for a xed coverage of booster vaccination, these simulations suggest that an early booster dose may be essential in curtailing disease spread if the coverageof booster vaccine is expected to decline (exponentially) over time. This scenario may correspond to vaccine refusal in the contexts of booster deferral (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention et al. 2009 ). Further simulations indicate that functional form of the decline in booster coverage can also play an important role in determining the optimal timing of booster vaccina- tion. With the inverted logistic functional form of represented by the dotted curve in Fig. 3, we observed that the protection efcacy of primary vaccination can influence the magnitude of reduction in R cwith the time delay in booster schedule (Fig. 4c). For a moderate to low protection efcacy of primary vaccination, early booster (similar to the scenario of exponential decline in ) leads to the maximum reduction in Rc. However, as the protection efcacy of primary vaccination increases (approximatelyabove 50% in these simulations), the maximum reduction of R ccorresponds to an intermediate time-interval for booster vaccination. Figure 4c indicates that an optimal timing of booster schedule may lead to disease elimination, while the disease can 123Delay in booster schedule as a control parameter in vaccination... 2177 6 18304254 6 18304254 1 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 06 18304254 effectiveness of primary vaccinationbooster schedule after primary vaccination (months)11.051.11.15 reproduction number(a) (b) (c) Fig. 4 Reproduction number ( Rc) as a function of protection efcacy of the primary vaccination (1 , xaxis) and delay in the booster dose schedule ( p,yaxis).

To further illustrate our ndings in terms of disease prevalence, we simulated the model for the scenarios of booster coverage, while xing the protection efcacy of theprimary vaccination. Figure 5a shows that for xed =0.95 and =0.8, the disease will be eliminated if the booster dose is offered 30 months after the primary vaccination. However, an earlier schedule of a booster dose 6 months after the primary vaccinationleads to the disease persistence in the population. This situation is reversed for the scenario of booster coverage that declines exponentially with time delay in booster vaccination. Figure 5b shows the disease elimination and persistence for =0.95, with the booster dose schedules of 2 and 24 months after the primary vaccination, respectively. When the booster coverage declines in a functional form similar to the inverted logistic function, Fig. 5c shows the disease persistence for early and late booster schedules of 1 and 24 months after the primary vaccination with =0.88. However, for an intermediate delay of 9 months in booster vaccination, the disease iseliminated over time. 1232178 Z.

Parameter values are the same as Fig. 5b with p=24 months, while the birth rate changes by Remark 4.1 For our theoretical results and simulations presented in Fig. 5, we assumed that the population size ( N) is constant. To illustrate the effect of a changing popula- tion size on the disease dynamics, we considered the parameter setting of Fig. 5b with p=24 months, and modied the birth rate by some constant value . Hence, > 0 corresponds to a growing population size, while < 0 represents a declining popu- lation. The results are illustrated in Fig. 6, showing the change in disease prevalence for different values of as the population size changes. 123Delay in booster schedule as a control parameter in vaccination... 2179 5 Discussion In this study, we investigated the role of booster schedule on the long-term disease dynamics. We developed a system of delay differential equations to include several key parameters describing the protection efcacy of primary vaccine series, durations of partial and full protection following vaccination, and coverage of primary and boosterdoses. In addition to investigating its dynamics, we simulated the model with a delay in booster dose after completing primary series using parameter values estimated for Hib. Simulation results indicate that, for a given protection efcacy of primary vaccination,the reduction of disease transmissibility, reflected in the reproduction number ( R c), depends critically on the timing of a booster dose. However, the coverage of booster vaccination remains a key parameter influencing the optimal timing of a booster dose.When the uptake of a booster dose is expected to remain high, a delay in booster vaccination (within the expected duration of protection induced by primary vaccine series) may be benecial in reducing R c, and could lead to disease elimination for a sufciently high protection efcacy of primary vaccination. This is particularly important if the booster dose provides only a relatively short period of full protection compared with the average lifetime. However, vaccination programs may contend with the possible drop-out and decrease in the coverage of booster vaccination, whether due to acquiring infection after receiving the primary series, or simply due to individualsvoluntarily forgoing (e.g., refusal of) the booster dose (Omer et al. 2009 ; Dub\u00e9 et al. 2013 ;B r i e r ee ta l . 2014 ). In this case, our simulations illustrate that if the coverage of booster vaccination decreases over time, then the timing of a booster dose can beessential to achieve the greatest reduction of disease prevalence over time. This study has important implications for public health vaccination policies. First, for routine infant immunization programs with high primary and booster coverages,deferral of a booster dose within the average duration of protection induced by the primary series may be benecial. However, the protection efcacy of the primary vac- cine series remains an important parameter in determining the optimal dosing intervalbetween primary and booster vaccination (Charania and Moghadas 2016 ). Second, in the absence of efforts to achieve an optimal schedule, having a booster program does not necessarily guarantee the elimination of disease, even though the incidence maybe reduced as has been observed for Hib. Given the high protection efcacy of primary vaccine series ( >85%) against Hib disease (Jackson et al. 2013 ), and weak evidence of additional protection from booster within one year following complete primary vac-cine series, our results suggest that immunization programs should consider a longer time interval between primary and booster doses. Furthermore, the sensitivity of long- term disease outcomes to the booster schedule underscores the importance of targeted efforts towards improving uptake rates of both primary series and booster vaccination. It is also important to note that our results herein apply to vaccines that confer onlya temporary protection. Conspicuously, for a vaccine that provides a long-term full protection comparable to the average life-time, the best outcomes are achieved with the shortest time interval between the primary and booster vaccination. Our study has several limitations that merit further investigation. Our model is based on the assumption of homogeneous mixing in the population dynamics of disease spread. It is well documented that heterogeneities and contact patterns can influence 1232180 Z. Wang et al. vaccination dynamics at both the individual and population levels (Metcalf et al. 2015 ). We assumed a uniform protection efcacy of primary and booster vaccination without considering immunological characteristics of individuals that affect the within-hostimmune dynamics. Our simulation results are based on the assumption that an anti-Hib polysaccharide conjugate vaccine provides stronger immune protection due to effects of carrier protein on stimulation and proliferation of immune responses. This is animportant consideration in the development of conjugate vaccines for T-cell indepen- dent pathogens (such as Hib) in order to enhance immunogenicity in infants and young children (Goldblatt 2000 ). We therefore assumed a shorter period of full protection following recovery from natural infection compared to booster vaccination. However, in older individuals with competent immune system, natural infection can also lead to the development of adaptive immune memory and therefore induce strong protec-tion effects with timelines similar to those conferred by conjugate vaccines (Goldblatt 2000 ). These considerations can be included in advanced computational frameworks, such as agent-based modelling (Laskowski and Moghadas 2014 ; Shoukat et al. 2018 ), in order to evaluate the effect of individual level characteristics on the population dynamics of disease spread and control in the presence of vaccination. Despite these limitations, our study provides a theoretical foundation for future studies involving more detailed computational and quantitative models to help improve vaccination pro- grams and booster schedules against vaccine-preventable diseases that require multiplevaccine doses.
