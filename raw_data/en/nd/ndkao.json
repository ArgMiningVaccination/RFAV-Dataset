Research Working with internationally recognized figures undertaking translational, clinical, and basic research in health problems particular to infectious diseases in the tropics and developing world Opportunities for multidisciplinary collaboration with investigators located both domestically and internationally Clinical Activities Parasitology Clinic at Jacobi Medical Center, a regional referral center Patient population enriched in unusual cases of infections in the returning traveler Management of difficult clinical cases by the application of basic, translational, and clinical science from our fields of expertise Travel to study sites abroad Formal Instruction Advanced training in clinical research and biostatistics through the Einstein Clinical Research Training Program (optional). Featured Faculty South Africa Jacqueline M. Achkar, MD, MS Faculty Mentor Co-Director Global Health Tuberculosis; Associate Professor, Department of Medicine Infectious Diseases; Associate Professor, Department of Microbiology & Immunology Dr. Achkar has established a successful translational research program in the field of tuberculosis serology and biomarker discovery which includes multiple ongoing national and international collaborations in countries such as South Africa and Panama. Her research is focused on the evaluation of human immune responses to M. tuberculosis in patients at various states of infection towards i) the development of novel diagnostic tests for active TB; and ii) the identification of correlates of protection against TB. Dr. Achkar travels to South Africa and Panama on a regular basis to give presentations, participate in rounds, and continue building her collaborations with physicians and scientist there. In addition to her research related work she also attends on the Infectious Disease Consult Service at Montefiore Medical Center, teaches and mentors undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate students, and is the Global Health concentration mentor for the Student Opportunities for Academic Research (SOAR) Program at Einstein. Publications James Brust, MD Assistant Professor, Department of Medicine (Infectious Diseases) Dr. Brust's research has focused on the dual epidemics of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) and HIV in South Africa. He designed and implemented a novel, home-based treatment program for patients co-infected with HIV and MDR TB and was awarded a K23 Career Development grant from the NIAID to study the program. With collaborators at Emory University, CDC, PHRI-Rutgers and the University of KwaZulu-Natal, he has been defining and examining responses to the epidemic in KZN. His research group showed that the majority of drug-resistant TB in KwaZulu-Natal province is the result of person-to-person transmission, rather than inadequate treatment. He holds an R01 from NIAID to study the new TB medication, bedaquiline in patients with extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB. This study, which includes investigators at the University of Cape Town will define the genetic mechanisms of resistance and drug-drug interactions with antiretroviral therapy as the drug is rolled out in South Africa.
