Definitions Acellular Matrix : A Matrix that is derived from sources other than human skin. Acellular Matrices are the most frequently used skin substitute. Acellular Matrices are composed of allogeneic or xenogeneic derived collagen, membrane, or cellular remnants. (Debels et al., 2015; Ferreira et al., 2011; Nicholas et al., 2016; Vig et al., 2017) Allogeneic Matrix : A Matrix that is derived from human tissue such as neonatal fibroblasts of the foreskin. (Debels et al., 2015; Ferreira et al., 2011; Nicholas et al., 2016; Vig et al., 2017) Composite Matrix : A Matrix that is derived from human keratinocytes and fibroblasts supported by a scaffold of synthetic mesh or xenogeneic collagen. These Matrices con tain active cellular components that continue to generate compounds and protein that may accelerate wound healing. (Debels et al., 2015; Ferreira et al., 2011; Nicholas et al., 2016; Vig et al., 2017) Full-Thickness Thermal Burn (Third Degree Burn) : A bur n with destruction of all layers of the skin. These burns involve all of the epidermal and dermal layers, with varying amounts of the sub -cutaneous layer involvement. (Gomez and Cancio, 2007) Human Skin Allograft : An allograft that is derived from donated human skin (e.g., cadavers) that has been processed to remove the cellular components. (Debels et al., 2015; Ferreira et al., 2011; Nicholas et al., 2016; Vig et al., 2017) Measurable Signs of Healing : Wound is diminishing in size (either surface or dept h) and there is decreased amount of exudate and necrotic tissue. (Gould et al., 2016) Partial -Thickness Thermal Burn (Second Degree Burn) : A burn that involves the epidermis and only part of the dermis. Deep Partial Thickness Thermal Burns involve the epidermis and most parts of the dermis, leaving few intact skin appendages and nerve endings. (Gomez and Cancio, 2007) Xenograft : Skin from another species (e.g., cows, pigs, horses, fish, etc.).

Their goal is to mimi c the properties of normal skin to create an environment to promote healing. Skin substitutes are an important adjunctive treatment in the management of acute or uninfected chronic wounds in addition to other soft tissue indications. There is no universal classification system that allows for simple categorization of all the products that are currently commercially available. Davison -Kotler's (2018) most recent system organized skin substitutes according to cellularity (cellular, acellular), layering (single layer, bilayer), replaced region (i.e., epidermis, dermis, or both), materials used (biologic, synthetic, or both), and permanence (temporary, permanent). The most common commercially available skin substitute products are acellular dermal substitutes made from natural biological materials from which the living cells have been removed. These include donated human dermis, human placental membranes, and animal tissue. Regardless of the source, the skin substitute provides a matrix into which cells can migrate to induce tissue regeneration and begin wound healing. Chronic Wounds Wounds are disturbances of the skin's structural and functional integrity and generally move through separate phases of healing until the skin's structure and function are restored. Patients with chronic wounds, such as diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers and venous leg ulcers, experience loss of function, pain, wound recurrence, and significant morbidity. The standard of care for all chronic wound types inclu des debridement of necrotic tissue, maintaining moisture balance, preventing and treating infection, correct ischemia, and compression (for venous leg ulcers) and offloading (for diabetic foot ulcers). Four weeks of standard treatments without a 50% reduct ion in wound size may require a change of, or additional therapies. Burns For burn injuries, historically, autologous skin grafts have been the only way to provide skin coverage following debridement . However, this can result in disfigurement and scarrin g of the donor site, as well as the potential lack of donor sites in severe cases. Dermal substitutes are an acceptable option for acute partial or full thickness burns, as well as partial thickness hypertrophic scars and contractures. Other Soft Tissue I ndications Skin and soft tissue substitutes can also be used for repair, reconstruction, and reinforcement of tendons, injection laryngoplasty, various cardiac applications including pericardial reconstruction, valve reconstruction, and acquired vascular defects, as well as trauma that results in skin avulsions and degloving injuries. The number of products and the rate at which they are being developed and becoming available for use clinically make it a challenge to perform high quality studies to compar e the effectiveness of one product over another. There is currently an ongoing clinical trial being conducted by St. Luke's Wound Care Clinic in Texas to develop a Cellular and Tissue Based Therapy Registry (CTPR) for Wounds. It is sponsored in collaborati on with the U.S. Wound Registry. Data is submitted by hospital outpatient departments regarding all cellular and tissue- based products currently reimbursed in the hospital- based outpatient department. Additional information can be found at: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02322554 . (Accessed August 24 , 2022) Many skin and tissue substitutes are included in and ongoing clinical trials. Refer to the follo wing for more information: www.clinicaltrials.gov Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 9 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC Clinical Evidence Systematic Reviews, Meta -Analyses, Guidelines and Technology Assessments That Address Multiple Skin Subst itutes A Hayes Health Technology Assessment for Skin Substitutes for Venous Leg Ulcers in Adults concluded that a low -quality body of evidence provided consistent evidence suggesting acellular and cellular skin substitutes may improve healing of chronic venous leg ulcers when used in conjunction with standard wound care (SWC). The Hayes report gives it a 'C' rating for use of acellular or cellular skin substitutes as an adjunct to standard wound care (SWC) to treat adults with chronic, uninfected venous leg ulcers that have not healed with SWC alone. Evidence directly comparing different cellular skin substitutes with SWC alone and for skin substitute products or types is extremely limited and of very low quality. Skin substitutes appear to be safe an d no major safety concerns were reported. Additional, large, well- designed clinical trials are needed to better evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of skin substitutes as adjuncts to SWC and as alternatives to other skin substitutes. Th e skin subst itutes that were part of the evidence base for this report included Epifix, TheraSkin, TalyMed, and PriMatrix . (Hayes, Skin Substitutes for Venous Leg Ulcers in Adults, 2020, Updated 2021) A Hayes report (2020 , updated 2022 ) for acellular skin substitutes for chronic foot ulcers in adults with diabetes indicates that there is an overall low -quality body of evidence suggesting that acellular skin substitutes appear to heal more chronic DFU than standard wound care (SWC) alone and in a shorter period of time . While acellular skin substitutes appear to have some benefits over cellular skin substitutes, in terms of the incidence and time to healing, and possibly quality of life, no definitive co nclusions can be drawn as to comparative effectiveness and safety o f these products due to the limited number of studies overall, and on the individual skin substitutes. Questions remain about the effect of acellular skin substitutes on the incidence of amputation and on ulcer recurrence due to the limited number of studies on these outcomes. Evidence directly comparing different acellular skin substitutes or comparing acellular with cellular skin substitutes is extremely limited and of very low quality to determine whether any 1 product or product type is superior. The acellular skin substitutes that were part of the evidence base for this report included Epifix, EpiCord, AmnioBand, AmnioExcel, MatriStem MicroMatrix, and DermCell. (Hayes, Acellular Skin Substitutes for Chronic Foot Ulcers in Adults with Diabetes Mellitus, 2020) A Hayes report (2020) for cellular skin substitutes for chronic foot ulcers in adults with diabetes indicates that there is a n overall low-quality body of evidence assessing the comparative effectiveness and safety of cellular skin substitutes incremental to SWC alone for treatment of DFUs in patients with Diabetes. The overall quality of the bodies of evidence comparing cellular skin substitutes with other cellular skin substitutes and cellular skin substitutes with acellular skin substitutes as adjuncts t o SWC are both very low. While cellular skin substitutes appear to benefit DFU healing over SWC alone, there is insufficient eviden ce on individual products to assess whether any particular cellular skin substitute is more effective than the others. Large, well- designed clinical trials are needed to better evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of cellular skin substitutes as adjuncts to SWC and as alternatives to acellular skin substitutes. The cellular skin substitutes that were part of the evidence base for this report included Affinity, Grafix, MatriStem MicroMatrix, and TheraSkin . (Hayes, Cellular Skin Substitutes for Chronic Foot Ulcers in Adults with Diabetes Mellitus, 2020 ; Updated 2021 ) In a technical brief prepared for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Snyder et al. (2020) evaluated s kin substitutes for treating chronic wounds. Systematic reviews/meta -analyses randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and prospective nonrandomized comparative studies examining commercia lly available skin substitutes in individuals with diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, pressure ulcers, and arterial leg ulcers were included in the review. Seventy -six commercially available skin substitutes were identified and categorized based on t he Davison -Kotler classification system. Sixty -eight (89%) were categorized as acellular dermal substitutes, mostly replacements from human placental membranes and animal tissue sources. Three systematic reviews and 22 RCTs examined use of 16 distinct skin substitutes, including acellular dermal substitutes, cellular dermal substitutes, and cellular epidermal and dermal substitutes in diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, and venous leg ulcers. Twenty -one ongoing clinical trials (all RCTs) examined an additional nine skin substitutes with comparable classifications. EpiFix was reviewed in five studies. Grafix/GrafixPrime, MatriStem Wound Matrix/MatriStem MicroMatrix, Theraskin and Dermacell were all reviewed in two studies each. The findings of the review included the following: While 85 percent of studies examining acellular dermal substitutes described the experimental intervention as favorable over standard of care for wound healing and shorter time to heal, insufficient data are available to determine wh ether wound recurrence or other sequela are less frequent with acellular dermal substitutes. Only three studies compared cellular dermal substitutes with standard of care. Clinical evidence for cellular dermal substitutes may be limited by the lack of robu st, well -controlled clinical trials of these products in this category. Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 10 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC Of the six head -to-head comparative studies, findings from five studies did not indicate significant differences between skin substitutes in outcomes measured at the latest follow -up (> 12 weeks). The investigators concluded that the current evidence base may be insufficient to determine whether one skin substitute product is superior to another. The investigators found little information on the long -term effects of using skin substitu tes. Wound recurrence was seldom reported, and potential toxic or carcinogenic effects are not known. Information on amputations and hospitalizations due to infections is also missing. Before findings can be relied upon, more data are needed on hospitaliza tion, pain reduction, need for amputation, exudate and odor control, and return to baseline activities of daily living and function. The investigators indicated that variation in study designs reduces the ability to compare outcomes across studies. For example, the investigators identified 20 different criteria in 38 (published and ongoing) studies reporting wound size inclusion criterion. Sizes ranged from as small as 0.5 cm2 to 100 cm2. One to 25 cm2 was the most common range used as a wound size inclusio n criterion. More than 4 weeks was the most common wound duration inclusion criterion (25 studies), while a few studies allowed up to 52 weeks. Only six published studies reported on wound recurrence after 12 weeks. Given the variation in these and other s tudy design features, the investigators indicated that research in this field may benefit from a more standardized study design. The investigators found that industry funded 20 of 22 RCTs included in this report, which raises significant concerns about possible publication bias or selective outcome reporting in that results unfavorable to industry may not be reported or published. According to the investigators, the lack of studies examining the efficacy of most skin substitute products and the need for better designed studies providing more clinically relevant data are this Technical Brief's clearest implications. The investiga tors indicated that future studies may be improved by using a 4 -week run -in period before study enrollment and at least a 12 -week study period. Future studies should also report whether wounds recur during 6 -month follow -up. Gordon et al. (2019) conducted a systematic review to determine the efficacy of biologic skin substitutes for healing diabetic foot ulcers. Some products includ ed in this review were Amnioexcel, Dermacell, Epicord, Epifix, Grafix, Matristem and Theraskin. The main objective was to calculate a pooled risk ratio for the proportion of wounds completely closed by 12 weeks . Secondary objectives included a pooled risk ratio for the proportion of wounds completely closed by 6 weeks and mean time to healing. Biologic skin substitutes were organized both very specifically into product brand and more broadly by 4 main groups based on product composition: allografts/xenograf ts, cultured skin grafts, dermal substitutes, and biosynthetic dressings. Twenty -five studies were identified that assessed the proportion of complete wound closure by 12 weeks. Wounds treated with biologic dressings were 1.67 times more likely to heal by 12 weeks than those treated with standard of care (SOC) dressings ( p < 0.00001). Five studies assessed the proportion of complete wound closure by 6 weeks. Wounds treated with biologic dressings were 2.81 times more likely to heal by 6 weeks than those treated with SOC dressings ( p = 0.0001). Descriptively, 29 of 31 studies that assessed time to healing favored biologic dressings over SOC dressings. Cultured skin grafts did not show a statistical difference over SOC. The authors concluded that this systemat ic review provides supporting evidence that biologic skin substitutes are more effective than SOC dressings at healing diabetic foot ulcers by 12 weeks. This review had several study limitations, one being the individual products were assessed in only one or two studies. Complete wound healing was assessed at 12 -weeks but the mean time to healing within that time periods was not assessed. Finally, adverse effects of the skin products were not mentioned. Future studies must address the relative benefits of d ifferent skin substitutes as well as the long-term implications of these products. Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Affinity There are few published studies addressing the use of Affinity. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Affinity ha s a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Affinity (Organogenesis Inc.) is a fluid membrane allograft that is intended for clinical use in wound repair and healing. See above section titled Systematic Reviews, Meta -Analyses, Guid elines and Technology Assessments That Address Multiple Skin Substitutes for additional articles/reports that evaluate Affinity. Serena et al. (2020) conducted a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled, clinical trial across 14 centers to assess clinical outcomes associated with the use of HSAM plus standard of care (SOC) compared with SOC alone in the treatment of DFUs over a 16 -week study period (12 -week treatment phase and a 4 -week follow -up phase). 76 subject s with DFUs were Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 11 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC treated with either Affinity plus standard care ( n = 38) or standard care alone (n = 38). Wound closure for the Affinity group was significantly greater than the control group at both 12 weeks (55% vs. 29%, p = 0.02) and 16 weeks (58% vs 29%, p = 0.01). At 16 weeks, wound closure was reported in 60% of Affinity subjects vs. 48% of control subjects ( p = 0.04). The authors reported that the probability of wound closure with Affinity vs. standard care increased by 75% (HR, 1.75). Limitations included the lack of binding and conducted under carefully controlled conditions. The authors concluded that the use of Affinity increased the frequency and probability of DFU wound closure. When used as an adjunct to SOC, HSAM significantly reduced baselin e ulcer area, depth and volume. Additional data from well -designed trials are needed to support these conclusions. AlloGen There are few published studies addressing the use of AlloGen. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether AlloGen has a benef icial effect on health outcomes. AlloGen (Vivex Biomedical, Inc.) is an amniotic fluid product derived from donated birth tissue. AlloGen is intended for treatment of non -healing wounds and burn injuries. AlloSkin There are few published studies addressing the use of AlloSkin. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether AlloSkin has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. AlloSkin (AlloSource) is a meshed human allograft skin for acute and chronic wound therapy. It is comprised of cadaveric epidermis and dermis. Moravvej et al. (2016) on meshed split thickness skin grafts (STSGs) in 14 patients. After debridement and wound excision, meshed STSG was used to cover the entire wound. Alloskin (allofibroblasts cu ltured on a combination of silicone and glycosaminoglycan) was applied on one side and petroleum jelly -impregnated gauze (Iran Polymer and Petrochemical Institute) was applied on the other. The healing time, scar formation, and pigmentation score were assessed for the patients. Alloskin demonstrated good properties compared to petroleum jelly -impregnated gauze. The average healing time and hypertrophic scar formation were significantly different between the two groups. In addition, the skin pigmentation score in the Alloskin group was closer to normal. The authors concluded that Alloskin grafting, including fibroblasts on meshed STSG, may be a useful method to reduce healing time and scar size and may require less autologous STSG in extensive burns where a h igh percentage of skin is burned and there is a lack of available donor sites. Larger prospective, controlled clinical studies are needed to compare the effectiveness, of human skin allograft to standard care. AlloWrap There are few published studies addr essing the use of AlloWrap. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether AlloWrap has a beneficial effect on health outcomes . Allowrap (AlloSource) is a human amniotic membrane designed to provide a biologic barrier following surgical repair. Amnio Amp -MP There are few published studies addressing the use of AmnioAmp -MP. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether AmnioAmp -MP has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. AmnioAmp -MP (CellGenuity Regenerative Science) amniotic membrane is a steri le human tissue allograft membrane patch intended for homologous use to cover and protect a recipient's tissue to be used for acute and chronic wounds, barrier to enhance soft tissue healing after a primary surgical repair and general reconstructive surger y to reduce scar tissue formation and enhance soft tissue healing. Amnio Wound There are few published studies addressing the use of Amnio Wound. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Amnio Wound has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 12 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC Amnio Wound (Alpha Tissue, LLC) is a lyophilized human amniotic membrane allograft comprised of an epithelial layer and two fibrous connective tissue layers specifically processed to be used for the repair and replacement of lost or damaged dermal tissue. Amnio Wrap2 There are few published studies addressing the use of Amnio Wrap2. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Amnio Wrap2 has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. AmnioWrap2 (Direct Biologics ) is a unseparated amnion and chorion membranes including the intact intermediate layer. It is indicated as a protective covering when placed over a wound bed or surgical site and provides the key components found in human placental tissues including an intact extracellular matrix (ECM), growth factors and cytokines. AmnioArmor There are few published studies addressing the use of AmnioArmor. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether AmnioArmor has a beneficia l effect on health outcomes. AmnioArmor (Bone Bank Allografts, a subsidiary of Globus Medical, Inc.) is a dehydrated human amniotic membrane allograft derived from placental tissue submucosa. It is intended as a wound covering for acute and chronic wounds . AmnioBand Viable Membrane and Guardian There is insufficient evidence to support the use of AmnioBand Viable Membrane and Guardian due to study limitations. Larger studies are needed to establish safety, efficacy and long -term outcomes. AmnioBand and G uardian (MTF Biologics) are human tissue allografts made of donated placental membrane. Although marketed under two different brand names, the products are identical. See above section titled Systematic Reviews, Meta -Analyses, Guidelines and Technology Assessments That Address Multiple Skin Substitutes for additional articles/reports that evaluate AmnioBand. A 2020 ECRI clinical evidence assessment concluded that while the evidence from two small randomized controlled trials and one case series suggest Amnioband may improve wound healing compared with Apligraf \u00ae and when added to standard care in patients with diabetic foot ulcers, the studies include too few patients to be conclusive, and the studies do not validate each other, because each on addressed a different comparison . Larger, double -blind RCTs are needed to validate findings, compare AmnioBand with other skin grafts, assess AmnioBand's use in different chronic wound types, and rep ort on longer -term outcomes. Alvaro -Afonso et al. (20 20) reviewed the recent advances in dermoepidermal skin substitutes (DSS) for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). PubMed and Cochrane databases were systematically searched for systematic revi ews published after 2013 and for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A retrospective evaluation of 28 RCTs was performed. Rates of complete wound closure and time to healing were examined for 17 commonly available DSS. Healing rates after 12 weeks and tim e to complete closure in DFUs were heterogeneous among the 28 RCT. The best healing rates at 12 weeks were accomplished with dermal cellular substitutes ( Epifix , 100% and Amnioband, 85%) . The authors concluded that based on these studies, DSS used in conju nction with standard care appear to improve the healing rates of DFUs, as compared with standard care alone. The authors indicat ed that new studies with more homogeneous samples are needed to ascertain the role of ulcer size, duration, depth and/or type in the efficacy of DSS. According to the authors, future RCTs should include patients with severe comorbidities, in order to be more representative of clinical reality. Glat et al. (2019; reviewed in the ECRI report above ) conducted a randomized controlled trial in which dehydrated human amnion and chorion allograft (dHACA) (AmnioBand) was compared to one of the earliest and most commonly accepted tissue - engineered skin substitutes (TESS) (Apligraf) in the treatment of nonhealing diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) over a period of 12 weeks to assess the superiority of healing. Following a 2 -week screening period during which subjects with DFUs were treated with collagen alginate dressing, 60 subjects were randomized at 5 sites to receive either dHACA or TESS applied weekly, with weekly follow -up for up to 12 weeks. The mean time to heal within 6 -week time period for the dHACA group was 24 days (95% Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 13 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC CI, 18.9- 29.2) versus 39 days (95% CI, 36.4- 41.9) for the TESS group; the mean time to heal at 12 weeks was 32 days (95% CI, 22.3- 41.0) for dHACA -treated 54.1 -72.6) for TESS -treated wounds. The proportion of wounds healed at study completion (12 weeks) was 90% (27/30) for the dHACA group versus 40% (12/30) for the TESS group. It was concluded that aseptically processed dHACA heals diabetic foot wounds more reliably and statistically significantly faster than TESS. Study limitations included the lack of blinding. Withdrawing patients at 6 weeks rather than continuing through 12 week s of treatmen t if their wounds were not sufficiently responding to treatment to ensure patient safety and permit other treatment pathways could also be considered a limitation. Another limitation was the insufficient follow up time needed to evaluate lon g- term outcomes or recurrence. Several of the study authors received research funds from MTF Biologics, the manufacturer of AmnioBand. DiDomenico et al. (2018 ; review ed in the Alvaro -Afonso systematic review and ECRI report ab ove) conducted a prospective, randomized, mu lti-center clinical trial and reported on the full trial results of 80 patients where AmnioBand Membrane dehydrated human amnion and chorion allograft (dHACA) was compared with standard of care (SOC) in achieving wound closure in non -healing diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). After a 2 -week screening period, during which patients with DFUs were unsuccessfully treated with SOC, patients were randomized to either SOC alone or SOC with dHACA applied weekly for up to 12weeks. At 12 weeks, 85% (34/40) of the dHACA -treated DFUs healed, compared with 33% (13/40) treated with SOC alone. Mean time to heal within 12 weeks was significantly faster for the dHACA - treated group compared with SOC, 37 days vs 67days in the SOC group. Mean number of grafts used per healed wound during the same time period was 4.0. The authors concluded that aseptically processed dHACA heals DFUs significantly faster than SOC at 12 weeks. Future studies should consider a comparative arm using an advanced skin substitute and allow wounds of greate r severity or depth. The findings of the RCT need confirmation through an independently conducted RCT. MTF funded the study, and several of the study authors are consultants for MTF. Paggiaro et al. (2018 ; reviewed in ECRI report above ) performed a syste matic review to analyze the scientific evidence found in the literature on the use of the amniotic membrane to stimulate diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) healing. Following the inclusion a nd exclusion criteria, randomized controlled trials (RCT) were identified, and the risk of bias was analyzed according to the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The authors conducted a meta -analysis of the two outcomes to evaluate the level of evidence. Six clinical trials were identified, with a total of 331 patients. When examining t he wound healing outcome, five studies (Zelen et al., 2016; Zelen et al., 2013b; Snyder et al., 2016; Lavery et al., 2014; DiDomenic et al., 2016) could be used for the meta -analysis. However, for wound healing time, only three studies (Zelen et al., 2016; Lavery et al., 2014; DiDomenic et al., 2016) could be used. The most common risks of bias in the studies were selection, attrition, and detection biases. From the meta -analysis, although the result difference of the intervention group (amnion) in relation to the control group was not statistically significant, it was found that wound healing in the group treated with amniotic membrane occurs 2.32 times more often and is 32 days faster in comparison with the group that used conventional dressings. The autho rs concluded that there is no statistical evidence to support the effectiveness of amniotic membrane in comparison with other conventional dressings. However, there is a clear tendency for the use of amniotic membrane treatment to result in a larger number of DFUs healing at a quicker rate. According to the authors, the main limitations of this study are the small number of RCTs found and the flaws found in the results published in these studies. The authors indicated that these two conditions impaired the statistical analysis and prevented the development of the definitive evidence for the use of amniotic membrane on DFUs. DiDomenico et al. (2017 ; review ed in ECRI report above ) conducted a retrospective crossover study to evaluate the effectiveness of dHACA in those patients that failed to respond to the SOC treatments and who exited the original recently published, prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) after failing up to 12 weeks of SOC treatment. (The RCT which is referenced above, compared aseptically processed dehydrated human amnion/chorion allograft (dHACA) to standard of care (SOC), and showed 85% wound closure rates were reported in the dHACA arm while only 25% of patients in the SOC arm healed). Patients with nonhealing wounds from the SOC arm after exit from the original study were offered weekly adjunctive applications of dHACA (AmnioBand) for up to 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of wounds completely healed at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints included t he difference in wound area from baseline to the end of study and the percentage area reduction (PAR). Eleven patients were eligible to participate and wounds for 9 of the 11 patients healed (82% ). The mean wound area decreased from 1.7 cm\u00b2 to 0.2 cm\u00b2, wit h a corresponding mean PAR of 92%. Of the 2 wounds that failed to heal, 1 diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) decreased in area by 91% and the other by 26%. The authors concluded that the results of this crossover study support the conclusions of the original RCT, w hich determined that aseptically processed dHACA is an effective means to treat recalcitrant DFUs. Further studies, including comparative clinical trials, may offer additional info rmation on this unique aseptically processed graft in the healing of chronic wounds. Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 14 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC DiDomenico et al. (2016; reviewed in the Alvaro -Afonso and Paggiaro systematic reviews above) compared aseptically processed dehydrated human amnion and chorion allograft (dHACA) versus standard of care (SOC) in facilitating wound closure in nonhealing diabetic foot ulcerations (DFUs). Patients with DFUs treated with SOC (off -loading, appropriate debridement, and moist wound care) after a 2 -week screening period were randomized to either SOC or wound -size- specific dHACA (AmnioBand, Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation) applied weekly for up to 12 weeks plus SOC. Primary endpoint was the percentage of wounds healed at 6 weeks between groups. At 6 weeks, 70% (14/20) of the dHACA -treated DFUs healed compared with 15% (3/20) treated with SOC alone. At 12 weeks, 85% (17/20) of the DFUs in the dHACA group healed compared with 25% (5/20) in the SOC group, with a corresponding mean time to heal of 36 and 70 days, respectively. At 12 weeks, the mean number of grafts used per healed wound for the dHACA group was 3.8. The mean wastage at 12 weeks was 40%. One adverse event and 1 serious adverse event occurred in the dHACA group; neither was graft related. Three adverse events and 1 serious adverse event occurred in the SOC group. The authors concluded that aseptically processed dHACA heals diabetic foot wounds significantly faster than SOC at 6 and 12 weeks with minimal graft wastage. The authors indicated that the imitations of this trial include the lack of blinding (patient and investigator) and lack of a so ft-tissue matrices comparator. Future studies may consider comparing different amniotic tissue forms and allowing wounds of greater severity or depth. AmnioBind There are no published studies addressing the use of AmnioBind for wound treatment. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether AmnioBind has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. AmnioBind is a terminally sterilized, dehydrated, full thickness placental membrane (PM) allograft consisting of amnion, chorion, and the associated intermediat e (spongy) layer used to treat acute and chronic wounds. AmnioCore There are no published studies addressing the use of AmnioCore for wound treatment. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether AmnioCore has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. AmnioCore (Stability Biologics) is a dual layer amniotic tissue allograft used to reduce scar tissue formation and modulate inflammation with natural barrier properties to enhance healing. Amniocyte Plus There are no published studies addressing the use of Amniocyte Plus for wound treatment. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Amniocyte Plus has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Amniocyte Plus (Predictive Biotech) is a minimally manipulated amniotic fluid allograft. It is intended fo r use in repair, reconstruction, replacement or supplementation of a recipient's cells or tissue. AMNIOEXCEL, AMNIOEXCEL Plus, or BioDExcel There is insufficient evidence to support the use of AMNIOEXCEL, AMNIOEXCEL Plus, or BioDExcel due to study limita tions. Larger studies are needed to establish safety, efficacy and long -term outcomes. AMNIOEXCEL, also marketed under trade name BioDExcel, (Integra LifeSciences, Inc.) is a dehydrated human amnion -derived tissue allograft with intact extracellular matri x that is intended to advance soft tissue repair, replacement and reconstruction. AMNIOEXCEL Plus is an extension of the AMNIOEXCEL and BioDExcel product line that incorporates additional layers of human- sourced amnion and chorion. Refer to the above section titled Systematic Reviews, Meta -Analyses, Guidelines and Technology Assessments That Address Multiple Skin Substitutes for additional articles/reports that evaluate AmnioExcel. An ECRI report for AmnioExcel (Integra LifeSciences) for dressing wounds and repairing soft -tissue defects indicates that the evidence for AmnioExcel is inconclusive. The studies reviewed had majo r limitations which resulted in a high risk of bias. Therefore, the evidence is inconclusive. (2019) Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 15 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC Paggiaro et al. (2018 ; reviewed in the AHRQ Technical Report above ) performed a systematic review to analyze the scientific evidence found in the literat ure on the use of the amniotic membrane to stimulate diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) healing.

From the meta -analysis, although the result difference of the intervention group (amnion) in relation to the control group was not statistically significant, it was foun d that wound healing in the group treated with amniotic membrane occurs 2.32 times more often and is 32 days faster in comparison with the group that used conventional dressings. The authors concluded that there is no statistical evidence to support the ef fectiveness of amniotic membrane in comparison with other conventional dressings. However, there is a clear tendency for the use of amniotic membrane treatment to result in a larger number of DFUs healing at a quicker rate. According to the authors, the ma in limitations of this study are the small number of RCTs found and the flaws found in the results published in these studies. The authors indicated that these two conditions impaired the statistical ana lysis and prevented the development of the definitive evidence for the use of amniotic membrane on DFUs. Haugh et al. (2017 ; reviewed in the AHRQ Technical Report above) performed a meta -analysis examining randomized controlled trials comparing amniotic tissue products with standard of care in nonhealing diabetic foot ulcers. A search of 3 databases identified 596 potentially relevant articles. Application of selection criteria led to the selection of 5 randomized controlled trials. The 5 selected randomized controlled trials represented a total of 311 patients. Three of the trials included compared EpiFix, a dehydrated amniotic membrane product, to SOC (Zelen et al., 2013b; Zelen et al., 2015; Zelen et al., 2016) One trial compared the use of dehydrated amniotic membrane allograft (DAMA), which is also a deh ydrated amniotic membrane product, and SOC to SOC alone (Snyder et al., 2016). One trial compared Grafix, a cryopreserved amniotic product to SOC (Lavery et al., 2014). The pooled relative risk of healing with amniotic products compared with control was 2. 7496. The authors concluded that the current meta -analysis indicates that the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers with amniotic membrane improves healing rates in diabetic foot ulcers. The authors state that further studies are necessary to confirm the findings identified in these 5 trials and to determine whether amniotic products have the same impact on all diabetic patients seen in clinical practice. The authors also state that although this analysis indicates that amniotic membrane has great potential fo r use in diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) in clinical practice, patients in all 5 of the included trials had to demonstrate adequate tis sue perfusion and a lack of any signs of infection to enroll. As many patients who develop DFUs do not demonstrate adequate tissue perfusion and are often plagued by chronic infections, it is unclear how these products would translate into every day clinical care of diabetic patients. According to the authors, the lack of follow -up of patients is a significant limitation of the identified studies and their review. In a systematic review and meta -analysis, Laurent et al. ( 2018 ) assessed the efficacy and time sensitivity of human amnion/chorion membrane treatment in patients with chronic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing human amnion/chorion membrane plus standard therapy and standard therapy alone in patients with DFUs were included in the analysis. Eligible studies were reviewed, and data extracted into standard form. The Cochrane Colla boration's tool for assessing the risk of bias was used. Review manager version 5.3 software was used for statistical analysis. Data were analyzed using a random effect model. Overall, the initial search of the four databases identified 352 published studi es; of these, seven RCTS were ultimately included in the meta -analysis (Zelen et 2016; DiDomenico et al., 2016; al., 2016; Lavery et al., 2014; Mohajeri- Tehrani et al., 2016). The analysis results sho wed that patients receiving amniotic membrane plus standard therapy had far fewer incomplete healing wounds than those receiving standard of care alone. Assessment of the wound healing state at 4 and 6 weeks revealed that the wound healing state was almost the same, but there was a net difference of wound healing state at 12 weeks. The authors concluded that human amnion/chorion membrane plus standard of care treatment heals DFUs significantly faster than standard of care alone. When using the amnion in pat ients with DFUs, the optimal times to assess progress in wound healing should be 4 and 12 weeks. According to the authors, the number of studies and the sample sizes were not sufficiently large, which can increase biases. The authors stated that further la rge studies or randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are still needed to verify the findings and assess healing in infected DFUs. Snyder et al. (2016 ; reviewed in the Paggiaro et al. 2018 systematic review, Haugh et al. (2017) meta -analysis, and Laurent et al. (2017) systematic review and meta -analysis and AHRQ Technology Report above ) conducted a study to evaluate dehydrated amniotic membrane allograft (DAMA) (AMNIOEXCEL) plus standard of care (SOC) compared to SOC alone for the closure of Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 16 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC chronic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs).This prospective, open -label, randomized, parallel group trial was implemented at 8 clinical sites in the United States. Eligibility criteria included adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus who have 1 or more u lcers with a Wagne r classification of grade 1 or superficial 2 measuring between 1 cm2 and 25 cm2 in area, presenting for more than 1 month with no signs of infection/osteomyelitis; ABI > 0.7; HbA1c Less than 12%; and serum less than 3.0 mg/dL. Eligible subjects were randomized (1:1) to receive either SOC alone (n = 14) or DAMA+SOC (n = 15) until wound closure or 6 weeks, whichever occurred first. The endpoint was the proportion of subjects with complete wound closure (defined as complete reepithelialization witho ut drainage or need for dressings. Thirty -five percent of subjects in the DAMA+SOC cohort achieved complete wound closure at or before week 6, compared with 0% of the SOC alone cohort. There was a more robust response noted in the per protocol population, with 45.5% of subjects in the DAMA+SOC cohort achieving complete wound closure, while 0% of SOC -alone subjects achieved complete closure. No treatment -related adverse events were reported. According to the authors, the results of this study suggest that DA MA is safe and effective in the management of DFUs, but additional research is needed. AmnioFix There is insufficient evidence to support the use of AmnioFix due to study limitations. Larger studies are needed to establis h safety, efficacy and long -term o utcomes. AmnioFix (MiMedx Group, Inc.) is a composite amniotic tissue membrane minimally manipulated to protect the collagen matrix and its natural properties. It is available in sheet/membrane, particulate, and wrap configurations for use in surgical (e. g., spinal fusion and discectomy), soft tissue, tendon, and nerve applications. Other AmnioFix products include AmnioFix Injectable that is intended for treatment of tendon and soft tissue injuries. An ECRI report for AmnioFill and AmnioFix Allografts (Mi Medx) for Use in Orthopedic Procedures indicates that the evidence is somewhat favorable for AmnioFix. Two randomized controlled trial (RCT) and three cases series shows that micronized AmnioFix injection is safe, relieves pain and improved function up to 3 months in patients with tendinopathies and arthritis. The RCTs were related to plantar fasciitis with three case series were related to arthritis and tendinosis. While the evidence is favorable for AmnioFix, larger RCTs are needed to validate results and assess long term outcomes. There were no studies evaluating AmnioFill in orthopedic procedures . for AmnioFix Amnion/Chorion Membrane Allograft (MiMedx ) for Treating Surgical Wounds indicates that the evidence for AmnioFix is inconclusive. Randomized controlled trials comparing AmnioFix with other skin substitutes and reporting on patient outcomes (e.g., complete wound healing, quality of life) are warra nted to determine the Amnion/Chorion Membrane Allograft (MiMedx) for Treating Surgical Wounds, 2019) A Hayes report for Human Amniotic Membrane (HAM) Injections for Treatment of Chronic Plantar Fasciitis indicates that a low - quality body of evidence suggests that HAM injections may result in pain relief and improved function. None of the studies reviewed by Hayes evaluated the comparative effectiveness of amniotic tissue- derived treatments compared with other types of injections such as platelet -rich plasma or botulinum toxin, extracorporeal shockwave therapy, or surgery. Substantial uncertainty remains regarding the comparative effectiveness. The studies included for review had limited follow -up of 12 weeks or less, mak ing it difficult to assess the long -term effects of this treatment. Double -blind RCTs with active treatment comparators (injectables, surgery, extracorporeal shockwave therapy) are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of amniotic tissue- derived allograft treatments for plantar fasciitis The products evaluated in this report included PalinGen Sport FLOW, Clarix FLO, and AmnioFix . (Hayes, 2019, updated 2021 ) Cazzell et al. (2018) conducted a prospective, single- blind, randomized controlled trial a t 14 sites in the United States to evaluate the efficacy of micronized dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane (dHACM) injection for plantar fasciitis (PF). Subjects were randomized to receive 1 injection, in the affected area, of micronized dHACM (AmnioF ix Injectable, MiMedx Group Inc.) (n = 73) or 0.9% sodium chloride placebo ( n = 72). Baseline visual analog scale (VAS) scores were similar between groups. At the 3 -month follow -up, mean VAS scores in the treatment group were 76% lower compared with a 45% reduction for controls, Foot Function Index -Revised (FFI -R) scores for treatment subjects had mean reduction of 60% versus baseline, whereas control subjects had mean reduction of 40% versus baseline. Of 4 serious adverse events, none were related to study procedures. The authors concluded that pain reduction and functional improvement outcomes were statistically significant and clinically relevant, supporting use of micronized dHACM injection as a safe and effective treatment for plantar fasciitis. Th e authors indicated that the study's results are limited as the comparative group received placebo injection; thus, the Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 17 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC effectiveness of micronized dHACM allograft versus other advanced therapies cannot be determined. The study is also limited by a short follow -up time. Ogaya -Pinies et al. (2018 ; reviewed in ECRI report above ) evaluated if the use of dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane (dHACM) allograft wrapped around the neurovascular bundles (NVB) during a robotic -assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) accelerates the return to potency. A total of 940 patients with preoperative Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) > 20 underwent RARP with some degree of bilateral nerve sparing (NS). Of these, 235 patients underwent RARP, with bilat eral placement of dHACM graft around the NVBs. They were matched in a 1:3 proportion with a similar group of patients (n = 705) who did not receive the allograft (control group or group 2). Minimum follow -up was 12 months. Postoperative outcomes were analy zed between propensity -matched dHACM graft (group 1) and non -graft groups (group 2). There were no significant demographic differences between the two groups. Potency was defined as the ability to achieve and maintain satisfactory erections firm enough for sexual intercourse, with or without the use of PDE -5 inhibitors. The mean time to potency was significantly lower in group 1 (2.37 months) versus group 2 (3.94 months). The potency recovery rates were superior for group 1 at all early time points measured except at 12 months. Patients who received the dHACM wrap around the NVB after RARP accelerates the return to potency when compared to a similar control group without the use of the allograft. We also demonstrated that this faster return to potency occurs regardless of the degree of the NS preservation. Younger patients (< 55 years of age) had the highest overall advantage if they received the graft. The authors concluded that their results indicate that dHACM placement at the site of the prostatic NVB does not increase the risk of biochemical recurrence after RARP, neither in the presence of positive surgical margin, extra -prostatic disease nor high Gleason score. However, potency recovery rates did not differ between groups at 12 -months post -RARP. Systematic review and network meta -analysis, Tsikopoulos et al. (2016) compared the efficacy of different injection therapies for plantar fasciopathy (historically known as 'plantar fasciitis'). Randomized trials comparing various injection therapies in a dults with plantar fasciopathy were included. The primary outcome was pain relief. Secondary outcomes included functional disability, composite and health -related outcomes. All outcomes were assessed (1) in the short term (up to 2 months), (2) the intermedia te term (2 -6 months) and (3) the medium term (more than 6 months to 2 years). Quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Twenty -two trials comprising 1216 patients were included in the review. Dehydrated amniotic membrane inject ions were significantly superior to corticosteroids in the short term in achieving the primary and composite outcomes. The authors concluded that although the dehydrated amniotic membrane provided significant clinical relief at 0 -2 months, there were no da ta about this treatment at 2 months and beyond. Zelen et al. (2013a) reported the results of a randomized clinical trial examining the efficacy of micronized dehydrated huma n amniotic/chorionic membrane (mDHACM) injection as for refra ctory plantar fasciitis. Forty -five patients injection of 2 cc 0.5% Marcaine plain, then either 1.25 cc cc mDHACM, or 1. 25 cc mDHACM. Follow -up visits occurred over 8 weeks to measure function, pain, and fu nctional health and well -being. Significant improvement in plantar fasciitis symptoms was observed in patients receiving 0.5 cc or 1.25 cc mDHACM versus controls within 1 week of treatment and throughout the study period. The authors concluded that in pati ents with refractory plantar fasciitis, mDHACM is a viable treatment option. According to the authors, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings. AMNIOMATRIX or BioDMatrix There are few published studies addressing the use of AMNIOMATRIX or BioD Matrix. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether AMNIOMATRIX or BioDMatrix has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. AMNIOMATRIX, also marketed under the trade name BioDMatrix, (Integra Lifesciences Corporation) is a viable human placental allo graft composed of morselized amniotic membrane and amniotic fluid components recovered from the same human donor. AMNIOMATRIX may be mixed with normal saline for application to surgical sites and open, complex or chronic wounds or mixed with the recipient' s blood to fill soft tissue defects. Amnio -Maxx and Amnio -Maxx Lite There are no published studies addressing the use of Amnio -Maxx or Amnio- Maxx Lite for wound treatment. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Amnio -Maxx or Amnio- Maxx Lite has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 18 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC Amnio -Maxx (Royal Biologics) is a dehydrated, amniotic tissue membrane graft. The dual layer patch is used for chronic, non - healing wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers or soft tissue defects. The Amnio -Maxx Lite version is a single layer. Amniorepair and AltiPly There are no published studies addressing the use of Amniorepair or AltiPly for wound treatment. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Amniorepair or AltiPly have a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Amniorepair and AltiPly (Aziyo Biologics) are human cellular and tissue- based products. They are lyophilized placental membrane allografts indicated for use as a biological barrier or wound cover, forming a protective cover for a variety of acute and chronic wounds. Amniotext There are no published studies addressing the use of Amniotext for wound treatment. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Amniotext has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Amniotext (Regenerative Labs) is an amniotic membrane derived, human tissue allograft suspension product. It is intended to serve as a barrier to aid in the repair and healing of a defect. Amniotext P atch There are no published studies addressing the use of an Amniotext patch for wound treatment. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether and Amniotext patch has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Amniotext patch (Regenerative Labs) is an amniotic membrane- derived, human tissue allograft. The product serves as a wound covering and is intended for chronic non -healing wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers . Amnion Bio There are few published studies addressing the use of Amnion Bio for wound treatment. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Amnion Bio has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. The product information for Amnion Bio (Axolotl Biologix, Inc.) is not currently available. AMNIPLY There are few published studies addressing the use of AMNIPLY. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether AMNIPLY has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. The product information on AMNIPLY is not currently available. Apis There are few published studies addressing the use of Apis. Therefore, it is not possible to conclu de whether Apis has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Apis is an absorbable, biodegradable skin substitute comprised of gelatin (porcine derived), Manuka honey, and hydroxyapatite. Skin substitutes are used to protect large or nonhealing wounds or b urns. Architect There are few published studies addressing the use of Architect extracellular matrix for wound treatment. Therefore, it is no t possible to conclude whether Architect extracellular matrix has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Architect (Harbor MedTech, Inc) is a sterile, extracellular equine derived collagen matrix (ECM) that is intended to treat partial or full thickness skin wounds. Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 19 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC Artacent There are few published studies addressing the use of Artacent for wound treatment. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Artacent has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Artacent Wound (Tides Medical) is a wound specific amniotic patch. It is derived from the submucosa of donated human placenta and it consists of collagen layers, including basement membrane and stromal matrix. According to the manufacturer, it is indicated for diabetic ulcers, pressure ulcers, venous stasis ulcers and burns. Artacent AC (Tides Medical) is a dehydrated, micronized choriamniotic membrane powder that is intended for acute and chronic wound applications including diabetic ulcers, pressure ulcers, venous stasis ulcers, and burns that are refractory to more conservative treatment. Sledge et al. 2020 conducted an observational analysis of Artacent, a unique amniotic patch that contains two layers of amnio n, and its ability to increase growth factor delivery for diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) that failed to heal 50% following standard of care (SOC) after 2 -4 weeks. 26 patients were previously randomized in a larger clinical trial (that was discontinued due to logistics) to either weekly or biweekly application of Artacent plus SOC and were included in per -protocol effectiveness analyses. The primary endpoint was complete closure at 12 weeks. The results showed baseline ulcers were larger than in most DFU clinical trials (4.65 \u00b14.89cm2), and for the primary endpoint, 17/26 (65%, 95% CI: 44- 83%) of the combined treatment arms achieved comple te closure. The authors concluded that healing rates are similar to those in other placental- based tissue studies. In addition, the relatively larger size of the ulcers suggests that the DLAM may be effective in ulcers that are more resistant to standard o f care and a clinical trial with a greater sample size is planned. Artacent Cord There are few published studies addressing the use of Artacent Cord. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Artacent Cord has a beneficial effect on health outcom es. Artacent Cord (Tides Medical) is a wound healing patch that is comprised of the umbilical cord. It is intended for the treatm ent of acute and chronic wounds such as diabetic ulcers, venous stasis ulcers, and burns. ArthroFLEX There is insufficient evidence to support the use of ArthroFLEX due to study limitations. Larger studies are needed to establish safety, efficacy and long -term outcomes.

Biovance (Celularity) is an amniotic membrane allograft derived from the placenta of a healthy, full- term human pregnancy, intended for the treatment of acute and chronic wounds including burns, diabetic ulcer, pressure ulcers and surgical wounds. An ECRI report for Biovance Amniotic Membrane Allograft (Celularity, Inc.) for treating chronic wounds indicates that the evidence for Biovance is inconclusive. The studies reviewed were very low -quality single arm studies that had major limitations which resulted in a high risk of bias. Therefore, the evidence is inconclusive. (ECRI Institute. Product Brief. Biovance Amniotic Membrane Allograft (Celularity, Inc.) Treating Chronic Wounds . Plymouth Meeting (PA): ECRI Institute; July 2020) In a 2020 ECRI clinical evidence assessment, it was concluded that based on two very low -quality single arm studies, the efficacy of Biovance for the treating chronic wounds compared to standard of care and other skin grafts can not be determined . Both studies had a high risk of bias due to four or more limitations, including small study size, incomplete outcomes reporting, and lack of controls, randomization, and blinding. Studies did not report on some key patient -oriented outcomes (e.g., infection, quality of life, wound size reduction). The studies assessed patients with different wound etiologies and different wound types, resulting in the results not generalizable across all patients or wound types. The pilot trial does not r eport outcomes for wound types separately (i.e., venous leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, arterial ulcers, and collagen vascular disease associated ulcers). Smiell et al. (2015) conducted a multicenter registry study to observe outcomes with use of a decellularized, dehydrated human amniotic membrane (DDHAM; Biovance) in uninfected, full -thickness, or partial -thickness wounds. Investigators were instructed to provide usual care regarding visit and application frequencies, concomitant ther apies, and change in wound- care regimens. The only exclusions were patients with actively infected wounds or known hypersensitivity to DDHAM. Fifteen sites with practicing wound care clinicians of various specialties participated in this review, enrolling chronic wounds including venous, diabetic, pressure, collagen vascular, and arterial ulcers -all of various severities, durations, sizes, and previous treatments. A total of 244 wounds were observed in this study, however, this review is limited to the 179 chronic wounds in 165 patients that were enrolled at 15 of the 19 participating centers. The 4 centers that enrolled acute wounds only were excluded. Results fro m the analysis of this very heterogeneous population demonstrated that during the usual course of an average of 8 weeks of wound management, patients experienced factors that significantly affected wound closure. These factors included wound infections, noncompliance with prescribed treatments (e.g., compression, off -loading, and wound care), re -injury of the wound, and systemic comorbidities. Nearly 50% of chronic wounds (including those that failed previous therapy with advanced biologics) with an average baseline area of 3.1 cm2 achieved complete closure within a median of 6.3 weeks without produc t- related adverse experiences. The authors concluded that this registry study demonstrated the safety and clinical benefit of DDHAM to support wound closure across a variety of chronic wound types and patient conditions in real -world environments. The auth ors recommended that these findings be validated in a prospective randomized controlled trial in chronic wounds with stricter enrollment criteria and monitoring of a standard of good wound care.

A Hayes report for Human Amniotic Membrane (HAM) Injections for Treatment of Chronic Plantar Fasciitis indicates that a low - quality body of evidence suggests that HAM injections may result in pain relief and improved function. None of the studies Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 23 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC reviewed by Hayes evaluated the comparative effectiveness of amniotic tissue- derived treatments compared with other types of injections such as platelet -rich plasma or botulinum toxin, extracorporeal shockwave therapy, or surgery. Substantial uncertainty remains regarding the comparative effectiveness. The studies included for review had limited follow -up of 12 weeks or less, making it difficult to assess the long -term effects of this treatment. Double -blind RCTs with active treatment comparators (injectables, surgery, extracorporeal shockwave therapy) are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of amniotic tissue- derived allograft treatments for plantar fasciitis.

CorMatrix There is insufficient evidence to support the use of CorMatrix due to study limitations. Larger studies are needed to establish safety, efficacy and long -term outcomes. CorMatrix porcine SIS- ECM (CorMatrix Cardiovascular, Inc.) extracellular matrix made from porcine small intestinal s ubmucosa (SIS), which supposedly contains structural proteins (such as collagens) and adhesion molecules to promote tissue ingrowth and regeneration. CorMatrix is also available in envelope form (CorMatrix Cangaroo\u00ae) to hold and restrict migration of impla ntable electronic devices and impede infection. CorMatrix has been used in a wide variety of cardiac applications including congenital cardiac and vascular surgery, pericardial reconstruction, valve reconstruction, and acquired vascular defects at differen t sites. Al Haddad et al. (2018) conducted a retrospective review of clinical outcomes following complete atrioventricular canal (CAVC ) repair. A total of 73 patients were analyzed, with an average operative age of 22 weeks. The majority (71%) of the patients underwent a 2 -patch repair. A CorMatrix patch was used for ventricular septal defect (VSD) closure in 77% of the patients, and/or in 75% of atrial septal defect closures. There was one in -hospital mortality (1.4%) due to respiratory failure. One patient required a pacemaker. At mid -term follow -up (1.6 years), a total of 7 patients required 8 reoperations due to cardiac- related indications, including 5 for left atrioventricular valve (LAVV) repair, 1 for LAVV replacement, and 2 isolated residual VSDs. The authors concluded that a standardized repair for CAVC resulted in excellent outcomes with low rates of reoperations. According to the authors, CorMatrix for the closure of CAVC produced good results with equivalent outcomes to other patch materials. This study is limited by the retrospective nature of the data collection. Kelley et al. (2017) reported on the treatment of Carpentier type IIIa and type IIIb mitral regurgitation (MR) large p atch leaflet augmentation technique u sing CorMatrix extracellular matrix (ECM). A single- site chart review was conducted on patients who underwent anterior leaflet augmentation performed with the Da Vinci surgical robot or through a median sternotomy. Only patients who had anterior leaflet au gmentation with porcine intestine ECM or autologous pericardium were included. Follow -up echocardiography was performed on all patients. Histologic specimens were available on ECM patches from a subset of patients who required reoperation. At total of 44 p atients (mean age, 62.6 \u00b112.2 years) underwent anterior ECM or autologous pericardium. Eight (32%) of the patients with ECM had recurrence of severe mitral regurgitation (MR) on echocardiography at an average time of 201 \u00b198 days. Seven (28%) patients required reoperation because of failure of the ECM patch including perforation excessive patch dilation (20%), and suture line dehiscence (4%). In contrast, none of the patients with pericardial augment ation developed severe MR or required operation. The authors concluded that for type III MR, a large anterior leaflet patch technique with porcine ECM was associated with a 32% recurrence rate of severe MR related directly to patch failure. According to th e authors, further research and development should be performed on the use of ECM materials with a goal to decrease the failure rate experienced in this study. Mosala Nezhad et al. (2016) attempted to systematically review the preclinical and clinical lit erature on the use of CorMatrix in cardiovascular surgery. The authors found that the published clinical and preclinical studies lacked systematic reporting of Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 25 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC functional and pathological findings in sufficient numbers of subjects. The authors identified o nly one level II study and only four studies that could reasonably be classified as level III studies, the remainder representing level IV studies that were case reports or small case series. The majority of published studies only reported immediate or ver y early postoperative findings although a handful of case reports examined outcomes past a year or more. According to the authors, there are emerging reports to suggest that contrary to expectations, an undesirable inflammatory response may occur in CorMat rix implants in humans and longer -term outcomes at particular sites, such as the heart valves, may be suboptimal. According to the authors, large -scale clinical studies are needed driven by robust protocols that aim to quantify the pathological process of tissue repair. Corplex There are few published studies addressing the use of Corplex for wound treatment. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Corplex has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Corplex (StimLabs, LLC) is a sheet of dehydrat ed human umbilical cord tissue used as a wound covering or barrier membrane for acute and chronic wounds.

Cymetra There are few published studies addressing the use of Cymetra. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Cymetra has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Cymetra (LifeCell) is a micronized, particulate form of AlloDerm which is an acellular dermal matrix. It is intended for soft tissue grafting and injection laryngoplasty. Tan and Woo (2010) conducted a retrospective review from a single surgeon of 381 injections of micronized dermis (MD) in 344 patients from 2000- 2010, to determine whether the material is temporary or permanent. The indications for MD were for both temporary and permanent correction of glottic insufficiency. Twenty -nine percent of all injections resulted in unwanted absorpt ion. Over -injection was needed and transcervical approach was preferred to prevent implant extrusion with over - injection (the median volume of injected material increased from 0.8 cc to 1.0 cc over the decade). In 159 patients with long - term follow -up (> 1 year), there was a 14% incidence of reinjection. The operative and postoperative complication rate was 1.05%. Despite this, the overall need for open procedures in patients with long -term follow -up was 20%. The authors concluded Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 26 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC that despite the problems of inconsistency in preparation, slow absorption and need for over -injection, micronized dermis is a safe allograft material that has long -term (> 1 year) stability. The material may reduce the need for open surgery and can be used for both temporary and permanent vocal fold augmentation. Further investigation is needed before clinical usefulness of this procedure is proven, and research with randomized controlled trials is needed to validate these findings. Cytal There are few published studies addressing the use of Cytal . Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Cytal has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Cytal wound matrix products (ACell, Inc.) are composed of a porcine- derived extracellular matrix, also known as urinary bladder matrix. Cytal is intended for the management of acute and chronic wounds and second -degree burns and injuries. An ECRI report for Cytal Wound Matrix stated that the evidence is mixed as to whether Cytal Wound Matrix is more effective or better tolerated than other skin substitutes for treating wounds. Evidence gaps remain on how well Cytal performs compared to other skin substitutes. (ECRI, 2019) An ECRI report for Cytal Burn Matrix stated that there is limited evidence regarding the effectiveness of Cytal for t reating burns. (ECRI, 2018) DermACELL, DermACELL AWM and DermACELL AWM Porous There is insufficient evidence to support the use of DermACELL, DermACELL AWM and DermACELL AWM Porous due to study limitations. Larger studies are needed to establish safety, efficacy and long -term outcomes. DermACELL , dermal allografts that that are intended for the management of chronic non -healing wounds such as diabetic and venous stasis ulcers, acute burns and other associated soft tissue injuries. Refer to the above section titled Systematic Reviews, Meta -Analyses, Guidelines and Technology Assessments That Address Multiple Skin Substitutes for additional articles/reports that evaluate DermACELL. In a 2020 ECRI clinical evidence assessment regarding DermACELL AWM for the treatment of chronic wounds, it was concluded that based on the evidence from one rand omized controlled trial (RCT) , DermACELL AWM appears to be safe and effective and achieves complete healing in more diabetic foot ulcers than standard of care. One small RCT provides insufficient evidence to determine how well Dermacell works to treat chr onic venous leg ulcers (VLUs) compared with standard care. RCTs that compare Dermacell AWM with standard of care and other ADMs used for treating chronic wounds are needed; 3 ongoing RCTs may partially address evidence gaps. Luthringer et al. (2020) condu cted matrices (H -ADMs) with standard of care (SOC) to evaluate the number of healed ulcers at 12 and 16 weeks and number of days to complete healing. As a secondary outcome, the efficacy of 3 H -ADM subtypes was studied. The 6 studies included in this meta -analysis investigated 3 subtypes of H GRAFTJACKET. These 3 H -ADM subtypes were chosen for analysis among other commercially available H -ADMs solely based on th eir mention in published studies that met inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria indicated articles be randomized controlled trials investigating the effects on neuropathic, nonischemic DFUs. Data from 312 DFUs in total were included in the meta -analysis. The results show H -ADMs are more effective in healing patients within a 12 -week (3.14; range, 2.04- 4.83) and 16- week period (2.35; range, 1.25- 4.43) in comparison with SOC. Further, the mean time to complete healing was shorter in the H -ADM group ( -2.31 da ys; range, - 2.67 to - 1.95 days) in comparison with SOC. Within the subgroups, 2 H -ADMs were associated with a higher likelihood of complete healing within 12 weeks when compared with SOC. The third H -ADM had a point estimate, which suggested superiority ov er SOC. According to the investigators, this study shows H -ADMs are associated with a higher likelihood of complete healing and fewer days to complete healing within a 12 -week and 16 -week periods when compared with SOC. The investigators noted that the commercial products performed similarly. The investigators indicated that the meta -analysis had several limitations. First, the studies were significantly heterogeneous. Of note, the SOC utilized, and frequency of H -ADM application was not consistent in the included studies. The overall heterogeneity between studies was addressed by utilizing a random effects model for analysis. Still, this calls into question the external validity of the data. The available studies are few and the total number of DFUs from th e Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 27 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC studies covered is relatively low and often industry -associated, thus, the results are likely somewhat confounded by publication bias. According to the investigators, further research is needed to better characterize the effects of H -ADM on DFUs at increased lengths of follow -up. More studies with larger sample sizes that are non -industry related are needed to investigate the efficacy of H -ADM. In a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open -label trial, Cazzell (2019 ; reviewed in ECRI report above ) eval uated the safety and dermal matrices (D -ADM; DermACELL AWM) compared with conventional wound care management in patients with chronic venous leg ulcers (VLUs) of the lower extremity. Patients were randomly assigne d to receive either D -ADM or standard of care (control) in a 2:1 ratio. Treatment began at week 0 and wounds were evaluated on a weekly basis until wound closure was observed or the patient completed 24 weekly follow -up visits. Eighteen patients were inclu ded in the D -ADM arm and 10 patients in the control arm. There was a strong trend of reduction in percent wound area for D -ADM patients with an average reduction of 59.6% at 24 weeks versus 8.1% at 24 weeks for control patients. In addition, healed ulcers in the D -ADM arm remained closed at a substantially higher rate after termination than healed ulcers in the control. The authors concluded that D -ADM demonstrated increased healing rates and reduction in wound size compared to conventional care. The small patient population and unbalanced proportion between the 2 groups (2:1) was a limitation of this study. According to the authors, larger prospective, randomized controlled studies are needed to better assess the use o f DermACELL AWM in clinical practice. Cazzell et al. (2019 b; reviewed in ECRI report above ) conducted a prospective, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an acellular dermal matrix allograft, DermACELL (D -ADM; LifeNet Health), in the treatment of large, complex diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) that probed to tendon or bone. Inclusion criteria were Wagner grade 3 or 4 DFUs between 4 weeks and 1 year in duration. All participants received one application of D -ADM at baseline and could receive one additional application if wound healing arrested. Ulcers were assessed weekly for 16 weeks using a laser measuring device. Sixty -one participants were included in the study, with an average wound area of 29.0 cm; 59 of these ulcers showed exposed bone. The entire per - protocol population (n = 47) achieved 100% granulation. The mean time to 100% granulation was 4.0 weeks with an average of 1.2 applications of D -ADM. Mean percent wound area reduction was 80.3% at 16 weeks. Those DFUs 15 cm or smaller were substantially more likely to close than DFUs larger than 29 cm over a 16 -week duration. The authors concluded that the D -ADM demonstrated the ability to rapidly reduce the size of large, complex DFUs with exposed bone. Some wounds did not completely heal by 16 weeks; however, the significant reduction in size suggests that these large, complex wounds may heal if given more time. A major limitation of this study is that it was uncontrolled, and it was not possible to make direct comparisons to results from standard of care. Another study limitati on was that the study follow -up ended after 16 weeks, which was an insufficient length of time to evaluate large ulcer healing. Cazzell et al. (2017 ; reviewed in the Luthringer et al., 2020 meta -analysis , and ECRI report above ) compared the efficacy and safety of a human acellular dermal matrix (ADM), D -ADM (DermACELL AWM; LifeNet Health), with a conventional care arm and an active comparator human ADM arm, GJ -ADM, for the treatment of chronic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). The study was a prospective, rando mized controlled trial that enrolled 168 diabetic foot ulcer subjects in 13 centers across 9 states. Subjects in the ADM arms received one application but could receive one additional application of ADM if deemed necessary. Screen failures and early withdr awals left 53 subjects in the D -ADM arm, 56 in the conventional care arm, and 23 in the GJ -ADM arm. Subjects were followed through 24 weeks with major endpoints at Weeks 12, 16, and 24. Single application D -ADM subjects showed significantly greater wound closure rates than conventional care at all three endpoints while all applications D -ADM displayed a significantly higher healing rate than conventional care at Week 16 and Week 24. GJ -ADM did not show a significantly greater healing rate over conventional care at any of these time points. A blinded, third -party adjudicator analyzed healing at Week 12 and expressed \"strong\" agreement. Closed ulcers in the single application D -ADM arm remained healed at a significantly greater rate than the conventional care arm at 4 weeks post termination (100% vs. 86.7%). There was no significant difference between GJ -ADM and conventional care for healed wounds remaining closed. Single application D -ADM demonstrated significantly greater average percent wound area reduction than conventional care for Weeks 2 -24 while single appli cation GJ -ADM showed significantly greater wound area reduction over conventional care for Weeks 4 -6, 9, and 11- 12. According to the authors, D -ADM demonstrated significantly greater wound healing, larger wound area reduction, and a better capability of ke eping healed wounds closed than conventional care in the treatment of chronic DFUs. This study was funded by LifeNet Health, the organization that manufacturers DermACELL. The authors indicated that a potential weakness of this study was that the investiga tors were not blinded to the treatment type when assessing wound closure. Walters et al. (2016 ; reviewed in the Luthringer et al., 2020 meta -analysis above ) conducted a 16-week multicenter, randomized, controlled trial to assess the healed ulcer rate of a human acellular dermal matrix, DermACELL, compared with conventional Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 28 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC care and a second acellular dermal matrix, Graftjacket, in the treatment of full- thickness diabetic foot ulcers. 168 patients were randomized into DermACELL, conventional care, and Graft jacket treatment arms in a 2:2:1 ratio. Patients in the acellular dermal matrix groups received either 1 or 2 applications of the graft at the discretion of the investigator. Weekly follow -up visits were conducted until the ulcer healed or the endpoint was reached. The results showed at 16 weeks, the DermACELL arm had a significantly higher proportion of completely healed ulcers than the conventional care arm, and a nonsignificantly higher proportion than the Graftjacket arm (67.9% vs 47.8%). The DermACELL arm also exhibited a greater average percent reduction in wound area than the conventional care arm (91.4% vs 80.3%) and the Graftjacket arm (91.4% vs 73.5%). The proportion of severe adverse events and the proportion of overall early withdrawals were similar among the 3 groups based on relative population size. The authors concluded that DermACELL is an appropriate clinical option in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers, with significant increases in healing rates and rate of percentage wound closure as compared with conventional care options. This study was sponsored by LifeNet Health, the manufacturer of DermACELL. Dermacyte There are few published studies addressing the use of Dermacyte Amniotic Would Care Matrix for wound treatment. Therefore, it is n ot possible to conclude whether the Dermacyte Amniotic Would Care Matrix have a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Dermacyte Amniotic Would Care Matrix (Merakris Therapeutics, Inc.) is a cross -linked human amniotic membrane allograft. It is intended to provide a protective covering and support for cell growth during the healing process of diabetic ulcers, venous ulcers, pressure ulcers, and burn wounds with exposed vital structures. Derma -Gide There are few published studies addressing the use of Derma -Gide. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Derma - Gide has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Derma -Gide is a collagen wound dressing for covering and regenerating soft tissue defect or soft tissue wounds. Armstrong et al. (2020) in an observational pilot study evaluated the safety and preliminary efficacy of a Derma- Gide, a novel decellularized purified reconstituted bilayer matrix (PRBM) in treating diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). Ten consecutive diabetic wounds that failed four weeks of standard wound care were treated weekly with the PRBM for up to 12 weeks. At each weekly visit, the wound was evaluated, photographed, and cleaned, followed by application of new graft if not completely epitheliali zed. Assessment included measurement of the wound area and inspection of the wound site for signs of complications. The primary outcome measure was wound closure, as adjudicated by independent reviewers. Secondary outcomes included assessment of overall adverse events, time to closure, percent area reduction, and the cost of product(s) used. Nine of 10 patients achieved complete wound closure within 4 weeks, and 1 did not heal completely within 12 weeks. The mean time to heal was 2.7 weeks. The mean wound area reduction at 12 weeks was 99%. No adverse events nor wound complications were observed. The author notes that this is the first published data using PBRM to treat a non -healing DFU. These early clinical findings suggest that the PRBM may be an effective tool in the treatment of diabetic foo t ulcers. Large, randomized studies are needed to validate the finding in this small observational study. DermaPure There are few published studies addressing the use of DermaPure. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether DermaPure has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. DermaPure (Tissue Regenex Group, PLC) is a decellularized human dermis product for the treatment of acute and chronic wounds by providing an environment that supports cell migration to facilitate the body's repair, or replacement, of damaged or inadequate skin tissue. In a 2017 analysis, Kimmel and Gittleman evaluated the use of DermaPure, a decellularized human skin allograft, in the treatment of a variety of challenging wounds. This retrospective observational analysis reviewed a total of 37 patients from 29 different wound clinics. Each patient received one application of DermaPure which was followed until complete closure. A statistical analysis was performed with the end point being complete healing. All wounds on average had a duration of 56 weeks and healed in an average time of 10 weeks. Individual wound categories included diabetic foot ulcers, which healed in 8weeks; venous leg ulcers, which healed in 11 weeks; and surgical/traumatic wounds, which healed in 11 weeks. This study was limited by a small sample size and lack of a control group. Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 29 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC DermaSpan There are few published studies addressing the use of DermaSpan. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether this product has a beneficial effect on health outcomes . DermaSpan (Zimmer Biomet \u00ae Sports Medicine) is an acellular dermal matrix derived from human allograft tissue. It is intended for use in various practices, including orthopedics, plastic surgery, and general surgery, for repair and replacement of dama ged or inadequate skin tissue (wound coverage). Dermavest and Plurivest There are few published studies addressing the use of Dermavest or Plurivest. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude wheth er Dermavest or Plurivest has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Dermavest and Plurivest (AediCell) are human amnion/chorion, umbilical cord and placental disk tissue matrixes intended to replace or supplement damaged or inadequate skin tissue and re- stabilize a debrided wound. Derm -Maxx There are few publis hed studies addressing the use of Derm -Maxx for wound treatment. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Derm -Maxx has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Derm -Maxx (Royal Biologics) is a freeze- dried allograft. It is intended for integumentary augmentation and serve as a covering for wounds and skin defects. Dual L ayer I mpax M embrane There are few published studies addressing the use of Dual layer impax membrane. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Dual layer impax membrane has a beneficial effect on health outcomes . Dual layer impax membrane (Legacy Medical Consultants) is a sterile dehydrated dual layered human amniotic membrane allograft intended to serve as a barrier or cover fo r acute and chronic wounds and for use as a barrier to protect wounds from the surrounding environment. Enverse There are no published studies addressing the use of Enverse for wound treatment. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Enverse has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Enverse is comprised of dehydrated human amniotic membrane obtained from donated placental tissue. Enverse contains non-viable cells and is to be used as a wound covering or barrier membrane, over chronic and acu te wounds, including dermal ulcers or defects. EpiCord There are several published studies addressing the use of EpiCord, all with study limitations. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether EpiCord has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. EpiCord (MiMedx Group, Inc.) is a minimally manipulated, dehydrated, non -viable cellular umbilical cord allograft. EpiCord is intended to be used in the treatment and management of chronic and acute wounds and burns to replace or supplement damaged or inadequate skin tissue. Refer to the above section titled Systematic Reviews, Meta -Analyses, Guidelines and Technology Assessments That Address Multiple Skin Substitutes for additional articles/reports that evaluate EpiCord. An ECRI report for Epicord Umbilical Cord Allograft (MiMedx) for Treating Diabetic Foot Ulcers reviewed one small randomized controlled trial (Tettelbach et al., 20 19b) which was of moderate quality. The results from this study need confirmation from further controlled trials; therefore, the evidence is inconclusive. (ECRI, 2020) Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 30 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC Tettelbach et al. (2019b ; reviewed in ECRI report above) evaluated the safety and effectiveness of dehydrated human umbilical cord allograft (EpiCord) compared with alginate wound dressings for the treatment of chronic, non -healing diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). A multicenter, randomized, controlled, clinical trial was conducted at 11 centers in the United States. Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes presenting with a 1 to 15 cm2 ulcer located below the ankle that had been persisting for at least 30 days were eligible for the 14 -day study run -in phase. After 14 days of weekly debridement, moist wound therapy, and off -loading, those with 30% wound area reduction post -debridement (n =155) were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive a weekly application of EpiCord (n =101) or standardized therapy with alginate wound dressing, non- adherent silicone dressing, absorbent nonadhesive hydropolymer secondary dressing, and gauze bandage roll (n =54). Study visits were conducted for 12 weeks. At each weekly visit, the DFU was cleaned and debrided as necessary, with the wound photographed pre- and post -debridement and measured before the application of treatment group -specific dressings. A follow -up visit was performed at week 16. The primary study end point was the percentage of complete closure of the study ulcer within 12 weeks, as assessed by Silhouette camera. Data for randomized subjects meeting study inclusion criteria were included in an intent -to- treat (ITT) analysis. Additional analysis was conducted on a group of subjects (n =134) who completed the study per protocol (PP) (EpiCord, n =86, alginate, n =48) and adequate debridement (EpiCord, n =67, alginate, n=40). ITT analysis showed that DFUs treated with EpiCord were more likely to heal within 12 weeks than those receiving alginate dressings, 71 of 101 (70%) vs 26 of 54 (48%) for EpiCord and alginate dressings, respectively. Healing rates at 12weeks for subjects treated PP were 70 of 86 (81%) for EpiCord -treated and 26 of 48 (54%) for alginate -treated DFUs. For those DFUs t hat received adequate debridement (n =107, ITT population), 64 of 67 (96%) of the EpiCord -treated ulcers healed completely within 12 weeks, compared with 26 of 40 (65%) of adequately debrided alginate -treated ulcers. There were no adverse events related t o either EpiCord or alginate dressings. According to the authors, these results demonstrate the safety and efficacy of EpiCord as a treatment for non -healing DFUs. MiMedx Group Inc. sponsored the study and provided study oversight and data compilation. EpiFix Injectable There are few published studies addressing the use of EpiFix Injectable. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Ep iFix Injectable has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. EpiFix Injectable (MiMedx Group, Inc.) is a micronized dehydrated amnion/chorion membrane extracellular collagen allograft comprised of an epithelial layer and two fibrous connective tissue layers that is proposed for acute and chronic wound care. See above section titled Systematic Reviews, Meta -Analyses, Guidelines and Technology Assessments That Addres s Multiple Skin Substitutes for additional articles/reports that evaluate EpiFix. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) medtech innovation briefing on EpiFix indicates that 5 reviewed studies sugg est that EpiFix may be an effective addition to standard care and compression therapy in people with chronic wounds. According to NICE, the key uncertainties are that there are no comparisons of EpiFix with standard National Health Service (NHS) care for a ny indication. Two of the 5 studies included in the report were written by the same group of authors and 4 studies were funded by the manufacturer of EpiFix . (NICE 2018) Diabetic Foot Ulcers Lakmal et al. (2021) conduced a systematic review to assess the impact of amniotic membrane in diabetic foot ulcers. The potential of human amniotic membrane to act as an allograft has been studied in diabetic foot wounds. The intent of this stud y is to evaluate the current scientific evidence on its effectiveness in h ealing diabetic foot ulcers. Research included studies from January 2000 to 30th March 2020. When searched with Mesh terms, 12 citations in PubMed, 22 citations in Cochrane library and 30 in other data bases were found After screening the studies and their reference lists, 12 studies met the inclusion criteria, and the others were excluded. There were 8 randomized control trials (RCTs), 2 prospective studies and 2 retrospective studies employing different preparation methods of the amniotic membranes. A wid e variation in study end points were noted. Majority of the RCTs ( n = 7) were concluded with significantly higher wound closure rate compared to the conventional treatment groups. In prospective and retrospective studies, it was shown that large chronic ulcers which were resistant to closure with standard therapy achieved wound closure with amniotic membrane allografts. A meta -analysis could not be performed due to study heterogeneity, and publication bias was not assessed due to the small number of availab le studies which was not Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 31 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC sufficient for accurate comparison. According to this systematic review, the current studies using amniotic membrane allograf ts give reliable evidence of reduction in healing time over conventional methods. Further prospective rand omized controlled studies with larger populations with long -term follow up are needed to strengthen the evidence. Su et al. (2020) conducted a systematic review and meta -analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of human amniotic membrane (HAM) allogr aft in treating chronic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). Nine studies were included in the qualitative systematic review and seven studies were included in the final meta -analysis. The primary outcome was the proportion of complete healing at 6 and 12 weeks. T he secondary outcomes were mean time to complete healing and adverse events. The proportion of complete wound healing in HAM plus standard of care (SOC) group was 3.88 times as high as that in SOC alone (RR: 3.88 [95% CI: 2.34, 6.44]) at 12 weeks (RR: 2.01 [95%CI: 1.45, 2.77]). The intervention group had a significantly shorter time to complete healing (MD: - 30.33 days, [95% CI: - 37.95, -22.72]). The number needed to treat within 6 weeks was 2.3 ([95% CI: 1.8, 3.1]). No significan t difference was shown in adverse events. Results were consistent in a sensitivity analysis. According to the investigators, HAM plus SOC is effective and safe in treating chronic DFUs at 6weeks a nd 12 weeks. According to the investigators, this review had several limitations. First, there are some potential biases, especially from the implementation of blinding patients that are due to the special feature of surgical trials (8 studies [88.9%] were u nable to blind patients). Second, change in the quality of life is important for patients with DFUs, but the meta -analysis failed to pool them together, because no original study investigated it. Alvaro -Afonso et al. (20 20) reviewed the recent advances in dermoepidermal skin substitutes (DSS) for the treatment of DFUs. PubMed and Cochrane databases were systematically searched for systematic reviews published after 2013 and for RCTs. A retrospective evaluation of 28 RCTs was performed without meta -analysis. Four of these used EpiFix, including three th at compared it to standard of care, with two also reviewed in the Su systematic review reported above. Rates of complete wound closure and time to healing were examined for 17 commonly available DSS. Healing rates after 12 weeks and time to complete closur e in DFUs were heterogeneous among the 28 RCT. The best healing rates at 12 weeks were accomplished with dermal cellular substitutes ( Epifix , 100% and Amnioband, 85%) . The authors concluded that based on these studies, DSS used in conjunction with standard care appear to improve the healing rates of DFUs, as compared with standard care alone. The authors indicated that new studies with more homogeneous samples are needed to ascertain the role of ulcer size, duration, depth and/or type in the efficacy of DSS . According to the authors, future RCTs should include patients with severe comorbidities, in order to be more representative of clinical reality. An ECRI report for Epifix for treating chronic wounds including diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) indicated that evidence from 4 small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on DFUs indicates that Epifix promotes healing better than standard of care. Weekly Epifix healed 70% of wounds in 12 weeks, biweekly Epifix healed 92% of wounds in 6 weeks and one RCT showed 97% at 12 weeks with biweekly Epifix. One RCT reported that weekly EpiFix treatment healed more wounds in 4 weeks than biweekly EpiFix (90% versus 50%; p = 0.014). Weekly treatment also lowered the mean time to complete healing (2.4 versus 4.1 weeks; p = 0.039). All studies were funded by the manufacturer. Although evidence is somewhat favorable, further studies are needed to address the evidence limitations. (ECRI Institute. EpiFix Amnion/Chorion Membrane Allograft (MiMedx) for Treating Chronic Wounds. December 2 019) In another systematic review evaluation of the literature, Luck et al. (2019) evaluated the efficacy and safety of allogeneic skin substitutes and human placental membrane allografts in the management of DFUs. Any RCT with an allogeneic skin substitu te or placental membrane allograft intervention group was included. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of completely healed ulcers. Secondary outcome measures included time to complete wound healing and local adverse event rates. Each study was assessed for risk of bias and the quality of evidence was appraised using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Moderate quality evidence from the 11 included RCTs demonstrated that both allogeneic cellu lar approaches improve the proportion of completely healed ulcers at 6 and 12 weeks. Evidence (Zelen et al., 2015; Zelen et al., 2016) showed that a placental membrane allograft (EpiFix) was superior to an allogeneic skin substitute (Apligraf) although this has yet to be repeated in other studies. The authors concluded that the addition of allogeneic cellular wound products to SWC improves DFU outcomes. According to the authors, further studies are required to conclusively establish if placental membrane allografts are superior to allogeneic skin substitutes. A limitation of this review is that outcome measures reporting heterogeneity precluded meta -analysis and extracted data are synthesized in narrative form only. Tettelbach et al. (2019 ; reviewed in the Su systematic review and ECRI report above ) conducted a manufactured sponsored randomized, controlled multicentre clinical trial (NCT01693133) at 14 wound care centers in the United States to confirm the Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 32 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC efficacy of dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane allograft (dHACM; EpiFix) for the treatment of chronic lower extremity ulcers in persons with diabetes. Inclusion criteria for the study included the following: ulcer size 1 cm2 and < 25cm2; Type I or 2 Diabetes; Ulcer duration of 4 weeks; unresponsive to standard wound care; no clinical signs of infection; serum creatinine < 3.0 mg/dL (within the last 6 months); glycated hemoglobin test (HgA1c) <12% (within the last 60 days); and adequate circulation to the affected extremity as demonstrated by dors um transcutaneous oxygen test (TcPO2) 30mm Hg, ankle -brachial index (ABI) between 0.7 and 1.2, or triphasic or biphasic Doppler arterial waveforms at the ankle of affected leg. The exclusion criteria included current participation in another trial; Cha rcot foot; index wound duration of > 52weeks without intermittent healing index; ulcer probing to tendon, muscle, capsule, or bone; currently receiving radiation or chemotherapy, known or suspected malignancy of current ulcer; a diagnosis of autoimmune co nnective tissue disease; the use of biomedical/topical growth factor within previous 30 days; pregnant or breast feeding; taking medications considered to be immune system modulator; allergy or known sensitivity to gentamicin or streptomycin; wounds improv ing greater than 25% over the 2 week run in period of the trial using standard of care dressing and Camboot offloading; patient taking Cox 2 inhibitors; and planned use of Dakin's solution, Mafenide acetate, scarlet red dressing, Tincoban, zinc sulfate, po vidone iodine solution, Mafenide acetate, Polymyxin/nystatin, or chlorhexidine during trial. Patients with a lower extremity ulcer of at least 4 weeks duration were entered into a 2 -week study run -in phase and treated with alginate wound dressings and appr opriate offloading. Those with less than or equal to 25% wound closure after run -in were randomly assigned to receive weekly epiFix application in addition to offloading or standard of care with alginate wound dressings, for 12 weeks. A total of 110 patien ts were included in the intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis, with 54 in the dHACM group and 56 in the no -dHACM group. Of the participants, 98 completed the study per protocol, with 47 receiving dHACM and 51 not receiving dHACM. The primary study outcome was per centage of study ulcers completely healed in 12 weeks, with both ITT and per -protocol participants receiving weekly dHACM significantly more likely to completely heal than those not receiving dHACM. A Kaplan -Meier analysis was performed to compare the time -to- healing performance with/without dHACM, showing a significantly improved time to healing with the use of allograft. Cox regression analysis showed that dHACM -treated subjects were more than twice as likely to heal completely within 12 weeks than su bjects who were not treated with dHACM. At the final follow up at 16 weeks, 95% of dHACM -healed ulcers and 86% of healed ulcers in the no -dHACM group remained closed. According to the authors, these results confirm that dHACM is an efficacious treatment fo r lower extremity ulcers in a heterogeneous patient population. Zelen et al. (2016; reviewed in the Su, Alvaro Alfonso, Luck, and ECRI systematic reviews above) continued the below study (Zelen et al. 2015) in order to achieve at least 100 patients and t o assess rates and time to closure. With the larger cohort, clinical outcomes were compared at 12 weeks in 100 patients with chronic lower extremity diabetic ulcers treated with weekly applications of Apligraf (n = 33), EpiFix (n = 32) or SWC (n = 35) with collagen -alginate dressing as controls. A Cox regression was performed to analyze the time to heal within 12 weeks, adjusting for all significant covariates. A Kaplan -Meier analysis was conducted to compare time- to-heal within 12 weeks for the three treat ment groups. Clinical characteristics were well matched across study groups. The proportion of wounds achieving complete closure within the 12 -week study period were 73% (24/33), Subj ects treated with EpiFix had a very significant higher probability of their wounds healing compared to SWC alone. No difference in probability of healing was observed for th e Apligraf and SWC groups. Patients treated with Apligraf were less likely to heal than those treated with EpiFix. Increased wound size and presence of hypertension were significant factors that influenced healing. Mean time- to-heal within 12 weeks was 47\u00b79 days with Apligraf, 23\u00b76 days with EpiFix group and 57\u00b74 days with the SWC alone group. Median number of grafts used per healed wound were six (range 1 -13) and 2\u00b75 (range 1- 12) for the Apligraf and EpiFix groups, respectively. The investigators concluded that these results provide further evidence of the clinical and resource utilization superiority of EpiFix compared to Apligraf for the treatment of lower extremity diabetic wounds. The authors indicated that the following limitation for this s tudy: patients were followed for only 1 week after complete healing, and wound recidivism was not recorded. According to the authors, additional studies will evaluate the recurrence rate over time. This study did not report a funding source. Zelen et al. (2015) conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel group, multi- center clinical trial at three sites to compare the healing effectiveness of treatment of chronic lower extremity diabetic ulcers with either weekly applications of Apligraf (Organogenesis, Inc.), EpiFix (MiMedx Group, Inc.), or standard wound care with collagen -alginate dressing. The primary study outcome was the percent change in complete wound healing after 4 and 6 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcomes included percent change in wound area per week and velocity of wound closure. A total of 65 subjects entered the 2 - week run -in period and 60 were randomized (20 per group). The proportion of patients in the EpiFix group achieving complete wound closure within 4 and 6 weeks was 85% and 95%, significantly higher than for patients receiving Apligraf (35% and 45%), or standar d care (30% and 35%). After 1 week, wounds treated with EpiFix had reduced in area by 83\u00b75% compared with 53\u00b71% for wounds treated with Apligraf. Median time to healing was significantly faster with EpiFix (13 days) compared to Apligraf (49 days) or standard care (49 days). According to the authors, the results of this study demonstrate the clinical and resource Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 33 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC utilization superiority of EpiFix compared to Apligraf or standard of care, for the treatment of diabetic ulcers of the lower extremities. Kirsner et al. (2015) evaluated the comparative effectiveness of a bioengineered living cellular construct (BLCC) (Apligraf) and a dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane allograft (dHACM) (EpiFix) for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). Using a wound care -specific electronic medical record database, the authors assessed real- world outcomes in 218 patients with 226 DFUs receiving treatment in 2014 at 99 wound care centers. The analysis included DFUs 1 and < 25 cm2 with duration < = 1 year and area reduction 20% in 14 days prior to treatment ( n = 163, BLCC; n = 63, dHACM). The average baseline areas and durations were 6.0 cm2 and 4.4 months for BLCC and 5.2 cm2 and 4.6 months for dHACM, respectively. Patients treated with dHACM had more applications compared to those treated with BLCC (median 3.0 vs. 2.0). A Cox model adjusted for key covariates including area and duration found the median time to closure for BLCC was 13.3 weeks compared to 26 weeks for dHACM, and the proportion of wounds healed were significantly higher for BLCC by 12 weeks (48% vs. 28%) and 24 weeks (72% vs. 47%). Treatment with a bioengineered living cellular technology increased the probability of healing by 97% compared with a dehydrated amniotic membrane. This study is limited by its retrospective design and according to the authors, the database used for the study was not designed specifically for research purposes, and as such, there may be missing data or data entry errors. In 2014, Zelen (2014a) published follow -up data from the Zelen et al., 2013 trial described above. Eighteen of 22 eligible patients returned for follow -up examination. At the 9 -12-month follow -up visit, 17 of 18 (94.4%) wounds treated with dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane (dHACM) remained fully healed. According to the authors, the limitations of this study include the retrospective study design and small sample size. The authors stated that larger studies are needed to confirm th eir findings. Zelen et al. (2014b) assessed if weekly applicatio n of dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane allograft reduces time to heal more effectively than biweekly application for treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. The study was an institutional review board - approved, registered, prospective, randomized, compar ative, non- blinded, single- center clinical trial. Patients with non -infected ulcers of 4weeks duration were included and randomized to receive weekly or biweekly application of allograft in addition to a non-adherent, moist dressing with compressive wra pping. The primary study outcome was mean time to healing. Overall, during the 12 -week study period, 92\u00b75% (37/40) ulcers completely healed. Mean time to complete healing was 4\u00b71 \u00b12\u00b79 versus 2\u00b74\u00b11\u00b78weeks in the biweekly versus weekly groups, respectively. According to the authors, these results validate previous studies showing that the allograft is an effective treatment for diabetic ulcers and show that wounds treated with weekly application heal m ore rapidly than with biweekly application. Limitations of this study include a small sample size. The lack of a standard care group not receiving dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane (dHACM) can be perceived as a study weakness, although according to the authors the intent of the study was solely to examine rates of healing according to frequency of application and not compare with other treatment modalities. The authors state that their findings should be confirmed and expanded with subsequent multicenter clinical trials and long -term follow -up data to validate the durability of healed wounds. In a prospective, randomized, single- center clinical trial, Zelen et al. (2013b; reviewed in the Su, Alvaro Alfonso, Luck, and ECRI systematic reviews above) c ompared healing characteristics of diabetic foot ulcers treated with dehydrated human amniotic membrane allografts (EpiFix \u00ae, MiMedx) versus standard of care. The study criteria for the following: ulcer size 1cm2 and<25cm2 , Type I or 2 Diabe tes, Ulcer duration of 4 weeks, unresponsive to standard wound care, no clinical signs of infection, serum creatinine < 3.0 mg/dL(within the last 6 months, HgA1c <12% (within the last 60 days), adequate circulation to the affected extremity as demonstra ted by dorsum transcutaneous oxygen test (TcPO2) 30mm Hg, ABI between 1.2, or triphasic or biphasic Doppler arterial waveforms at the ankle of affected leg. The exclusion criteria included current participation in another trial, Charcot foot, in dex wound duration of > 52weeks without intermittent healing index ulcer probing to bone; currently receiving radiation or chemotherapy, known or suspected malignancy of current ulcer, a diagnosis of autoimmune connective tissue disorder, the use of biomedical/topical growth factor within previous 30 days, pregnant or breast feeding, taking medications considered to be immune system modulators and an allergy or known sensitivity to gentamicin or streptomycin. Patients were randomized to receive standard ca re alone or standard care with the addition of EpiFix. Epifix was applied at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 if the ulcer was unhealed. Wound size reduction and rates of complete healing after 4 and 6 week s were evaluated. In the standard care group ( n = 12) and the Epi Fix group (n = 13) wounds reduced in size by a mean of 32.0% \u00b147.3% versus 97.1% \u00b17.0% after 4 weeks, whereas at 6 weeks wounds were reduced by - 1.8% \u00b170.3% versus 98.4% \u00b15.8%, standard care versus EpiFix, respectively. After 4 and 6 weeks of treatment the overall healing rate with application of EpiFix was shown to be 77% and 92%, respectively, whereas standard care healed 0% and 8% of the wounds, respectively. The Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 34 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC authors concluded that patients treated with EpiFix achieved superior healing rates over sta ndard treatment alone and that these results show that using EpiFix in addition to standard care is efficacious for wound healing. Limitations of this study include a small sample size. An additional limitation is that the comparative group in the study did not receive other advanced therapies to assess if the EpiFix allograft is as good as, or better, than other available advanced wound care products. According to the authors, additional comparative effectiveness studies are required to address this issue. The study is further limited by possible conflict of interest and lack of masking to the intervention. Venous Leg Ulcers There is limited evidence related to the safety and long -term outcomes of EpiFix for treating venous leg ulcers. An ECRI report for Epifix for treating chronic wounds including venous leg ulcers (VLUs) reported evidence from two small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding VLUs. One RCT reported weekly EpiFix plus compression treatment healed more wounds than moist wound dressing plus compression in 12 weeks (60% versus 35%; p = 0.0128). The other RCT reported that 62% of wounds treated with EpiFix plus compression therapy achieved > 40% closure at 4 weeks compared with 32% wounds treated with compression therapy alone (p = 0.005 ). All studies were funded by the manufacturer. Although evidence is somewhat favorable, further studies are needed to address the evidence limitations . (ECRI Institute. EpiFix Amnion/Chorion Membrane Allograft (MiMedx) for Treating Chronic Wounds. December 2019) The earlier study reported by Bianchi et al. (2018) (see below) only reported per -protocol (PP) study results (n =109, 52 EpiFix and 57 standard care patients), although there were 128 patients randomized: 64 to the EpiFix group and 64 to the standard care group. The purpose of the present study (Bianchi et al., 2019 ; reviewed in ECRI report above ) is to report intention -to-treat (ITT) results on all 128 randomized subjects and assess if both ITT and PP data analyses arrive at the same conclusion of the efficacy of EpiFix as a treatment for venous leg ulcers (VLUs). Rates of healing for the ITT and PP populations were, respectively, 50% and 60% for those receiving EpiFix and 31% and 35% for those in the standard care cohort. Within both ITT and PP analyses, these differences were statistically significant. The authors concluded that the results of this study show that, in both ITT an d PP analyses, VLUs treated with EpiFix as an adjunct to debridement, moist wound dressings, and compression had significantly higher rates of healing than those treated with comprehensive wound care alone. This study was funded by th e manufacturer, MiMedx Group, Inc. Bianchi et al. (2018 ; reviewed in ECRI report above) conducted a randomized, controlled, multicentre clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of Epifix, a dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane allograft as an adjunct to multilayer compression therapy for the treatment of non -healing full- thickness venous leg ulcers. A total of 109 subjects were randomly assigned to receive EpiFix and multilayer compression (n =52) or dressings and multilayer compression therapy alone (n =57). Patients were recruited from 15 cent ers around the USA and were followed up for 16 weeks. The primary end point of the study was defined as time to complete ulcer healing. Participants receiving weekly application of EpiFix and compression were significantly mor e likely to experience complete wound healing than those receiving standard wound care and compression (60% versus 35% at 12weeks and 71% versus 44% at 16 weeks). A Kaplan -Meier analysis was performed to compare the time- to-healing performance with or without EpiFix, showing a significantly improved time to healing using the allograft. Cox regression analysis showed that subjects treated with EpiFix had a significantly higher probability of complete healing within 12 weeks versus without EpiFix. According to the authors, these results confirm the advantage of EpiFix allograft as an adjunct to multilayer compression therapy for the treatment of non -healing, full -thickness venous leg ulcers. These findings require confirmation in larger randomized controlled trials. This study was sponsored and funded by the manufacturer of Epifix, MiMedx Group, Inc. Miranda et al. (2016) conducted a retrospective analysis of prospectively acquired data for 8 lower extremity free flaps with ulcerations in the context of venous insu fficiency and/or lymphedema. The first 4 were flaps that had been treated with conservative wound care to healing. The second group was treated conservatively initially but then converted to treatment wit h dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane (EpiFix) grafts. The primary endpoint was time to healing. Comparison of Kaplan -Meier survival curves revealed a significant difference between the conservatively and dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane -treated flap ulcers, favoring graft treatment. In those u lcers that healed, the average time to healing was 87 days for the conservative treatment group and 33 days for the dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane treatment group (with an average of 1.7 grafts per ulcer). The authors concluded that dehydrated hu man amnion/chorion membrane may accelerate healing of ulcers on lower extremity free flaps in patient with lymphedema and/or venous disease in the treated leg. The authors stated that is study was limited by a small sample size which limits sweeping conclu sions. There is also no true randomized control or comparison group available, so it cannot be firmly concluded that dHACM accelerates healing of ulcers on free flaps with lymphedematous or venous -insufficient limbs. Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 35 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC Serena et al. (2015) evaluated correct correlation between an intermediate rate of wound reduction (40% wound area reduction after 4 -weeks treatment) and complete healing at 24 weeks in patients with a venous leg ulcer (VLU) in a retrospective follow -up of the study by Serena et al. (2014) described above. Outcomes assessed were rates of complete healing within 24 weeks of enrolment and days to healing. Data were divided into two groups based on status at RCT completion (healed at least 40% yes or no). Correct correlation with status at 4 weeks and complete healing within 24 weeks was determined. Clinical characteristics were also compared for patients with and without correct correlation between 4 -week and 24 -week status. Fifty -five patients at 5 study sites were included. Some 47 without comple te healing during the initial study were eligible. As three patients were lost to follow -up, a total of 44 records were evaluated. Of these, 20 (45.4%) had reduced wound size of 40% and 24 (55%) had < 40% reduction during the initial study. Complete heal ing occurred in 16/20 (80%) of the 40% group at a mean of 46 days and 8/24 (33.3%) of the < 40% group at a mean of 103.6 days. Overall, correct correlation of status at 4 weeks and ultimate healing status of VLU occurred in 32/44 patients (73%). The auth ors indicated that these results confirm that the intermediate outcome used in our initial study is a viable predictor of ultimate VLU healing. According to the authors t here are limitations of the present study. During the follow -up period after completio n of the initial 4 -week RCT, patients received various treatments that may or may not have included initiation of, or additional application of dHACM, or other advanced treatments. Also, in the initial R CT, dHACM was only applied once or twice during the s tudy period, which may not be reflective of how the treatment is used in a real-world setting. Serena et al. (2014 ; reviewed in ECRI report above) conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of one or two applications of dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane allograft and multilayer compression therapy vs. multilayer compression therapy alone in the treatment of venous leg ulcers (VLU). Patient inclusion criteria included presence of a VLU extending through the full thickness of the skin but not down to muscle, tendon, or bone, VLU present for at least 1 month, and VLU has been treated with compression therapy for at least 14 days. The primary study outcome was the proportion of patients achieving 40% wound closure at 4 weeks. Of the 84 participants enrolled, 53 were randomized to receive allograft and 31 were randomized to the control group of multilayer compression therapy alone. At 4 weeks, 62% in the allograft group and 32% in the control group showed a gr eater than 40% wound closure, thus showing a significant difference between the allograft -treated groups and the multilayer compression therapy alone group at the 4 -week surrogate endpoint. After 4 weeks, wounds treated with allograft had reduced in size a mean of 48.1% compared with 19.0% for controls. The authors concluded that venous leg ulcers treated with allograft had a significant improvement in healing at 4 weeks compared with multilayer compression therapy alone. According to the authors, lack of l ong-term follow -up data did not allow for the validation of duration of healed wounds.

Grafix, GrafixPRIME and membrane comprised of an extracellular matrix (ECM) containing collagen, growth factors, fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and epithelial cells native to the tissue. See above section titled Systematic Reviews, Meta -Analyses, Guidelines and Technology Assessments That Address Multiple Skin Substitutes for additional articles/reports that evaluate Grafix. An ECRI Clinical Evidence Assessment for Grafix Cellular Repair Matrix for Treating Chronic Wounds indicates that evidence from 2 RCTs (Ananian et al., 2018; Lavery et al., 2014) and 3 retrospective studies and 7 prospective studies suggest Grafix is safe and may be more effective than EpiFix dressing and noninferior to Dermagraft \u00ae at promoting chronic wound healing. Evidence from 12 studies of varied designs and qual ity indicates Grafix is safe and may aid healing of wounds that failed to heal with standard care alone. Grafix may be noninferior to Dermagraft\u00ae and more effective than EpiFix\u00ae, but the available evidence is insufficient to draw firm conclusions regarding comparative effectiveness. Additional independent RCT's would be useful to understand Grafix wound closure rate, healing time and likelihood of wound reoccurrence, plus other studies comparing Grafix Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 37 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC with other active dressings and autologous skin grafts. (ECRI, Grafix Cellular Repair Matrix (Osiris Therapeutics, Inc.) for Treating Chronic Wounds, 2021) A Hayes Health Technology Assessment for Grafix Cryopreserved Placental Membrane concluded that a low -quality body of evidence provided consistent eviden ce suggesting that adjunctive treatment with Grafix Cryopreserved Placental Membrane may improve healing of chronic diabetes -related foot ulcers. There is insufficient evidence comparing Grafix with other skin substitutes. Significant uncertainty exists because of the low number of comparative studies, variability in wound characteristics across studies, and limited follow -up. Additional well- designed comparative trials are needed to confirm that Grafix is more effective than standard wound care alone. Studies addressing appropriate patient selection criteria are also needed to establish which patients and wound types would most benefit from Grafix (Hayes, Grafix Cryopreserved Placental Membrane. (Osiris Technologies Inc. for Treatment of Chronic Foot Ulcers in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus 2019 , updated October 2021 ) In a prospective single- center open -label single- arm study, Farivar et al. (2019) enrolled patients with active venous leg ulcers (VLUs) that had failed to heal after a trial of standard ther apy of at least 12 weeks, which included weekly multilayer compression therapy along with local wound care. The same patients subsequently received application of human viable wound matrix (hVWM) (Grafix) every 1 to 2 weeks in addition to standard therapy. Healing with hVWM therapy was then compared with standard therapy, with each patient serving as his own control. There were 30 VLUs in 21 consecutive eligible patients who were enrolled in the study. All patients were men with an average age of 67 years, and the average area of venous ulcers before hVWM initiation was 12.2 cm 2. Complete ulcer healing was achieved in 53% (16/30) of VLUs refractory to standard therapy after application of hVWM. There was a mean reduction in wound surface area by 79% after a mean treatment time of 10.9 weeks. Eighty percent of VLUs were reduced in size by half compared with 25% with standard therapy. The mean rate of reduction in ulcer area after hVWM applications was 1.69% per day vs 0.73% per day with standard therapy. It was concluded that cryopreserved placental tissue improves healing processes to achieve complete wound closure in a significant proportion of chronic VLUs refractory to standard therapy and that adjunctive therapy with hVWM provides superior healing rates in refractory VLUs. According to the authors, large, randomized trials are needed to confirm these preliminary results. Raspovic et al. (2018) conducted a real world setting retrospective analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of viable cryopreserved placental membrane (vCPM; Grafix) for diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) management using electronic health records. The primary endpoint was the proportion of DFUs that achieved complete closure. De -identified EHR data for 360 patients with 441 wounds treated with vCPM were extracted from the database. Average patient age was 63.7 years wi th a mean wound size of 5.1 cm 2 and an average wound duration of 102 days prior to vCPM treatment. For evaluation of clinical outcomes, 350 DFUs larger than 0.25 cm2 at baseline were analyzed. Closure at the end of treatment was achieved in 59.4% of wounds with a median treatment duration of 42.0 days and 4 applications of vCPM. The probability of wound closure at week 12 was 71%, and the number of amputations and wound -related infections was 13 (3.0%) and 9 (2.0%), respectively. Data also demonstrated a correlation between wound size and closure rate as well as a correlation between >50% wound area reduction by week 4 and wound closure by week 12. The authors indicated that the results of this study support the benefits of vCPM for DFU management . Study li mitations include the retrospective nature of the study and the absence of a control cohort. Lavery et al. (2018) conducted a single- arm, open -label extension phase of the Grafix (cryopreserved placental membrane) multicenter, blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial for chronic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) that was previously reported by Lavery and colleagues in 2014. In the extension phase, 26 patients in the standard wound care (SWC) arm whose DFUs did not close in the blinded phase chose to receiv e weekly applications of Grafix in an open -label extension phase. Seventeen (65.4%) patients closed their wounds in a median of 34 days and 3 visits. There were fewer total adverse events (AEs) (24 CPM vs. 52 SWC) and index wound -related infections (5 CPM vs. 12 SWC) during Grafix application compared with the number of AEs for the same patients during the SWC treatment in the blinded phase of the trial. According to the authors, these results corroborate the benefits of this cryopreserved placental membran e combined with SWC over SWC alone for chronic DFUs previously reported for the blinded randomized phase of the trial. This study is limited by its small sample size. Ananian et al. (2018 included in ECRI report above) analyzed clinical outcomes between a viable cryopreserved placental membrane (vCPM; substitute (hFDS; Dermagraft) for the treatment of chronic diabetic foot ulcers in a prospective, multicenter, randomized, single- blind study. The outcom es of 62 patients were analyzed: 31 patients in the vCPM treatment group and 31 patients in the hFDS treatment group. Utilizing a non -inferiority trial design and the established treatment regimen of 8 applications for hFDS, the authors demonstrated that v CPM was not inferior to hFDS for the proportion of patients achieving complete wound closure. However, preliminary findings show that vCPM may have better outcomes for wounds 5 cm 2: 81.3% (13/16) of wounds in the vCPM group vs. 37.5% (6/16) of wounds in the hFDS group Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 38 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC reached complete closure at the end of treatment. Future studies will be needed to confirm these preliminary results. According to the authors, study limitations include the single blind design of the study, the lack of stratification by wou nd location and size for analyses, the lack of a follow -up period after the treatment phase of the trial, and the lack of specificity regarding wound location. Paggiaro et al. (2018) performed a systematic review to analyze the scientific evidence found in the literature on the use of the amniotic membrane to stimulate diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) healing. Following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, randomized controlled trials (RCT) were identified, and the risk of bias was analyzed according to the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The authors conducted a meta -analysis of the two outcomes to evaluate the level of evidence. Six clinical trials were identified, with a total of 331 patients. When examining the wound healing outcome, five studies (Zelen et al., 2 016; Zelen et al., 2013b; Snyder et al., 2016; Lavery et al., 2014; DiDomenic et al., 2016) could be used for the meta -analysis. However, for wound healing time, only three studies (Zelen et al., 2016; Lavery et al., 2014; DiDomenic et al., 2016) could be used. The most common risks of bias in the studies were selection, attrition, and detection biases. From the meta -analysis, although the result difference of the intervention group (amnion) in relation to the control group was not statistically significant , it was found that wound healing in the group treated with amniotic membrane occurs 2.32 times more often and is 32 days faster in comparison with the group that used conventional dressings. The authors concluded that there is no statistical evidence to s upport the effectiveness of amniotic membrane in comparison with other conventional dressings. However, there is a clear tendency for the use of amniotic membrane treatment to result in a larger number of DFUs healing at a quicker rate. According to the au thors, the main limitations of this study are the small number of RCTs found and the flaws found in the results published in these studies. T he authors indicated that these two conditions impaired the statistical analysis and prevented the development of t he definitive evidence for the use of amniotic membrane on DFUs. Haugh et al. (2017) performed a meta- analysis examining randomized controlled trials comparing amniotic tissue products with standard of care in nonhealing diabetic foot ulcers. A search of 3 databases identified 596 potentially relevant articles. Application of selection criteria led to the selection of 5 randomized controlled trials. The 5 selected randomized controlled trials represented a total of 311 patients. Three of the trials included compared EpiFix, a dehydrated amniotic membrane product, to SOC (Zelen et al., 2013b; Zelen et al., 2015; Zelen et al., 2016) One trial compared the use of dehydrated amniot ic membrane allograft (DAMA), which is also a dehydrated amniotic membrane produc t, and SOC to SOC alone (Snyder et al., 2016). One trial compared Grafix, a cryopreserved amniotic product to SOC (Lavery et al., 2014). The pooled relative risk of healing with amniotic products compared with control was 2.7496. The authors concluded that the current meta -analysis indicates that the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers with amniotic membrane improves healing rates in diabetic foot ulcers. T he authors state that further studies are necessary to confirm the findings identified in these 5 trials and to determine whether amniotic products have the same impact on all diabetic patients seen in clinical practice. The authors also state that althou gh this analysis indicates that amniotic membrane has great potential for use in diabetic foot ulcers (DF Us) in clinical practice, patients in all 5 of the included trials had to demonstrate adequate tissue perfusion and a lack of any signs of infection to enroll. As many patients who develop DFUs do not demonstrate adequate tissue perfusion and are often plagued by chronic infections, it is unclear how these products would translate into every day clinical care of diabetic patients. According to the authors, the lack of follow -up of patients is a significant limitation of the identified studies and their revi ew. In a systematic review and meta -analysis, Laurent et al. (2017) assessed the efficacy and time sensitivity of human amnion/chorion membrane treatment in patients with chronic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) compari ng human amnion/chorion membrane plus standard therapy and standard therapy alone in patients with DFUs were included in the analysis. Eligible studies were reviewed, and data extracted into standard form. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing th e risk of bias was used. Review manager version 5.3 software was used for statistical analysis. Data were analyzed using a random effect model. Overall, the initial search of the four databases identified 352 published studies; of these, seven RCTS were ultimately included in the meta -analysis (Zelen et 2016; DiDomenico et al., 2016; al., 2016; Lavery et al., 2014; Mohajeri- Tehrani et al., 2016). The analysis results showed that patients receiving amni otic membrane plus standard therapy had far fewer incomplete healing wounds than those receiving standard of care alone. Assessment of the wound healing state at 4 and 6 weeks revealed that the wound healing state was almost the same, but there was a net difference of wound healing state at 12 weeks. The authors concluded that human amnion/chorion membrane plus standard of care treatment heals DFUs significantly faster than standard of care alone. When using the amnion in patients with DFUs, the optimal times to assess progress in wound healing should be 4 and 12 weeks. According to the authors, the number of studies and the sample sizes were not sufficiently large, which can increase biases. The authors stated that further large studies or randomized contro lled trials (RCTs) are still needed to verify the findings and assess healing in infected DFUs. Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 39 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC Johnson et al. (2017) reported on the clinical outcomes in two nonrandomized, however statistically equal and homogenous patient cohorts receiving either a viab le intact cryopreserved human placental membrane (vCPM) or a dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane (dHACM), for the management of wounds at a single center. A total of 79 patients with 101 wounds were analyzed: 40 patients with 46 wounds received vCPM ( Grafix) and 39 patients with 55 wounds received dHACM (EpiFix). The proportion of wounds achieving complete wound closure was 63.0% (29/46) for vCPM and 18.2% (10/55) for dHACM for all treated wounds combined. According to the authors, the retrospective an d nonrandomized nature of this single -center study present significant limitations. In a randomized controlled study, Lavery et al. (2014 ; reviewed in the Paggiaro et al, 2018; Haugh et al., 2017; and Laurent et al., 2017 systematic reviews and meta -analy ses above ) compared the efficacy of Grafix, a human viable wound matrix (hVWM) (n = 50), to standard wound care ( n = 47) to heal diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). Standard care included off -loading and nonadherent dressings (Adaptic) and either saline- moistened gauze or Allevyn for moderately draining wounds. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with complete wound closure by 12 weeks. Secondary endpo ints included the time to wound closure, adverse events and wound closure in the crossover phase. The proportion of patients who achieved complete wound closure was significantly higher in patients who received Grafix (62%) compared with controls (21%). Th e median time to healing was 42 days in Grafix patients compared with 69.5 days in controls. There were fewer Grafix patients with adverse events (44% versus 66%) and fewer Grafix patients with wound -related infections (18% versus 36%). Among the study sub jects that healed, ulcers remained closed in 82% of patients (23 of 28 patients) in the Grafix group versus 70% (7 of 10 patients) in the control group. The authors concluded that treatment with Grafix significantly improved DFU healing compared with stand ard wound therapy. According to the authors, the results of this well- controlled study showed that Grafix is a safe and more effective therapy for treating DFUs than standard wound therapy. These findings require confirmation in a larger study. Grafix Cor e There are few published studies addressing the use of Grafix Core . Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Grafix Core has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Grafix Core is a cryopreserved chorion matrix with limited product information. Helicoll There are limited studies related to Helicoll for wound treatments, second degree burns, and chronic ulcers. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Helicoll has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Helicoll (MCT Medical Solutions L LC) is a semi occlusive, self -adhering collagen sheet used for wound treatments, second degree burns, and chronic ulcers. This biodegradable skin substitute is made from animal tissues. In an evidence- based review, McNamara et al. (2020) discussed the pr inciples in pediatric wound management and new treatments published in the literature to date. Databases were searched for relevant sources including Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science and DynaMed. Findings noted that amniotic membrane living skin equivalent is a cellular matrix that has been reportedly successful in treating pediatrics wounds and is currently under investigation in randomized clinical trials. The a uthors indicated that Helicoll, an acellular matrix, shows promise in children with recessive dys trophic epidermolysis bullosa. According to the authors, there have been promising results in many studies to date, but RCTs involving larger sample sizes a re necessary, in order to determine the specific role these advanced products play in pediatric woun ds and to identify their safety and efficacy. Dhanraj (2015) conducted a prospective randomized controlled study to compare Helicoll, a type I pure collagen dressing, to OpSite dressing and to Scarlet Red dressing in the treatment of standardized split -thickness skin grafts (STSG) donor sites. Thirty patients, over a 3 -month period, underwent various reconstructive procedures, necessitating the use of STSGs. Following a simple randomized clinical protocol, the analysis of data included donor site pain, hea ling time of the donor site, initial absorption of the applied dressing and rate of infection with the three different dressings. Patients in the Helicoll group r eported significantly less pain, less infection rate and required no dressing change when comp ared with the OpSite or the Scarlet Red groups. Healing time of the donor site in the Helicoll group was shorter than that in the Scarlet Red group; however, it was comparable to the OpSite group. The authors concluded that Helicoll, as a donor site dressing, is successful in providing pain - free mobility with a measurable healing rate. Study limitations include a small study population and only one wound type (STS G donor site) was evaluated. Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 40 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC hMatrix There are few published studies addressing the use of hMat rix. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether hMatrix has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. hMatrix PR ADM (Bacterin International, Inc) is an acellular dermal matrix allograft derived from donated human skin. It is indicated to provide appropriate support and reinforcement for hernia and abdominal wall repairs. Human Health Factor 10 Amniotic Patch (HHF10 -P) There are no published studies addressing the use of Human Health Factor 10 Amniotic Patch (HHF10 -P) for wound treatment. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether HHF10 -P has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. HHF10P is a sin gle-layer amniotic allograft derived from donated and screened, full- term human birth tissue, specifically the immunoprivileged amnion layer. It is a semi- transparent, minimally manipulated, terminally sterilized membrane allograft. HHF10 -P TM is intended for homologous use to act as a covering or barrier to offer protection from the surrounding environment in clinical applications. Hyalomatrix There are several non -comparative published studies addressing the use of Hyalomatrix, all with study limitations . Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Hyalomatrix has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Hyalomatrix (Medline Industries) is a non -woven pad comprised of a wound contact layer made of a derivative of hyaluronic acid (HA) in fibrous form with an outer layer comprised of a semipermeable silicone membrane. It is indicated for the management of a variety of wounds. The ECRI reports for Hyalomatrix Tissue Reconstruction Matrix for treating burns and chronic wounds both indicated that the evidence for these products is inconclusive because there is limited evidence. No data are available to determine how Hyalomatrix compares to other wound dressings for healing any type of chronic wound . (ECRI Hyalomatrix Tissue Reconstruction Matr ix for treating burns, 2018; ECRI Hyalomatrix Tissue Reconstruction Matrix for treating chronic wounds, 2018, updated April 2021; Simman et al. 2018) In a 2018 prospective, noncomparative clinical case series, Simman et al. (reviewed in ECRI report above) sought to analyze the efficacy of a hyaluronic acid -based matrix (HYALOMATRIX) in the treatment of lesions where the extracellular matrix was lost. Twelve patients with 12 serious surgical wounds of different etiologies participated. Many defects showed e xposed muscle, tendons, and/or bone. After thorough debridement, a hyaluronic acid --based matrix, with a removable, semipermeable silicone top layer, was applied for the purpose of generating a neodermis. In a number of cases, the matrix was combined with negative pressure wound therapy. All wounds developed granulation tissue. Nine wounds were subsequently closed with a split -skin autograft. There was no graft failure. Three wounds healed by secondary intention. All wounds showed complete reepithelialization. The authors concluded that in this case series, the use of a hyaluronic acid -based matrix provided a granulation tissue and all lesions healed completely and shows a strong trend for Hyalomatrix to play an important role in supporting wound healing in complex, surgical wounds. Limitations include lack of a control group and small number of participants. InnovaMatrix AC or Innovamatrix FS There are few published studies addressing the use of InnovaMatrix AC and Innovamatrix FS . Therefore, it is not poss ible to conclude whether InnovaMatrix AC or Innovamatrix FS has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. InnovaMatrix AC is a skin substitute created from extracellular matrix (ECM) found in porcine placenta for the treatment of acute, traumatic, and chron ic wound care. InnovaMatrix FS is a decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM) topical wound covering derived from porcine placental tissue. Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 41 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC Integra Flowable Wound Matrix There are several published studies addressing the use of Integra Flowable Wound Matrix, all with study limitations. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Integra Flowable Wound Matrix has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Integra flowable wound matrix (Integra Life Sciences, Inc.) is an advanced wound care pro duct comprised of granulated cross - linked bovine tendon collagen and glycosaminoglycan. It is intended for the management of deep or tunneling wounds. Campitiello et al. (2017) conducted a randomized clinical trial with the aim to evaluate the efficacy o f an advanced wound matrix (Integra Flowable Wound Matrix) for treating wounds with irregular geometries versus a wet dressing in patients with diabetic foot ulcers. The study was conducted in the General Surgery Unit and Geriatric of the Second University of Naples, Italy, for 12 months. Forty -six cases of diabetic foot ulcers (Grades 3 Wagner) were equally and randomly divided into control and test groups. The first group treated with Integra Flowable Wound Matrix, while the control group with a wet dress ing. Both groups were evaluated once a week for 6 weeks to value the degree of epithelialization and granulation tissue of the wound. The complete healing rate in the whole study population was 69.56% (Integra Flowable Wound Matrix group, 86.95%, control g roup, 52.17%). Amputation and rehospitalization rates were higher in the control group compared to the treatment group; therefore, the difference was statistically significant. The Integra Flowable Wound Matrix was significantly superior, compared to the w et dressing, by promoting the complete healing of diabetic foot ulcers. The authors concluded that this product is appropriate in the management of diabetic foot ulcers, but additional research is needed, and will shed more light on the promising advantage s of this material in healing diabetic foot ulcers. This study was excluded from the AHRQ report (Snyder et al., 2020) because it did not meet the criteria for using adequate standard of care. An ECRI report for Integra Flowable Wound Matrix concluded tha t available evidence is inconclusive due to too few data on outcomes and comparisons of interest to determine whether Integra Flowable Wound Matrix is effective and safe for treating diabetic foot ulcers. Only one randomized controlled trial comparing trea tment with Integra Flowable Wound Dressing to treatment with a wet dressing was identified. This RCT has several limitations including a small sample size, no blinding, and being conducted in a single medical center in a single country, the need for longer follow up resulting in a risk of bias. (ECRI, 2019 ) InteguPly There are few published studies addressing the use of InteguPly. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether this produ ct has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. InteguPly (AZIYO\u00ae Biologics) is a human acellular dermal matrix intended for the treatment of chronic diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers and pressure wounds. It is also intended for the Support, protection, reinforcement or covering of tendon, ligament and rotator cuff . Interfyl There are few published studies addressing the use of Interfyl. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Interfyl ha s a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Interfyl (Celularity) is a decellularized and dehydrated placental disc (cho rionic plate) derived extracellular matrix. Interfyl is intended for treating deep dermal wounds, irregularly shaped and tunneling wounds, augmentation of deficient/inadequate soft tissue, and the repair of small surgical defects. Keramatrix There are sev eral studies related to Keramatrix, all with study limitations. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Keramatrix has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Keramatrix (Keraplast Technologies LLC) is an absorbable keratin rich dressing indicated for full and partial thickness wounds with low to high exudate. It is comprised of freeze dried acellular, animal- derived keratin protein. Loan et al. (2016) conducte d a controlled study that included 40 patients with superficial or partial thickness burn injuries treated with Keramatrix, compared to 40 historical controls who received standard of care treatment. The results indicated a Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 42 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC significantly faster mean healin g time in the Keramatrix group than in the control group (8.7 days vs. 14.4 days). This is a small, nonrandomized trial. Davidson et al. (2013) conducted a randomized controlled trial using a standard care alginate (Algisite) dressing side by sid e with an experimental dressing (Keramatrix) on 26 patients with partial- thickness donor site wounds. The proximal/distal placement of the control and treatment was randomized. Percentage epithelialization after approximately 7 days was estimated from which time to fully epithelialize can be inferred. Patients were grouped into \"young\" ( 50 y/o) and \"old\" (> 50 y/o). For the \"old\" patients ( n = 15), the median epithelialization percentage at 7 days is 5% and was significantly greater for the experimental dressing. For the \"young\" patients ( n = 11), the median epithelialization percentage at 7 days was 80% and there is no significant difference between the experimental and Standard Care control dressings. The authors concluded that Keramatrix dressing significantly increases the rate of epithelialization of acute, traumatic partial- thickness wounds in older patients. This study was limited by a small sample size and short follow -up time. Kerasorb There are few published studies addressing the use of Kerasorb. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Kerasorb has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Kerasorb (Keraplast Technologies LLC) is a keratin protein based topical wound and surgical dressing for treating skin wounds. Kerecis Omega 3 Products There are several studies related to Kerecis Omega3 Products ; all with study limitations. T Although the evidence for this product is somewhat favorable, there is limited evidence related to the safety and long -term outcomes of th ese product s. Kerecis (formally known as Marigen) produces skin and tissue- based products for use in surgery and for treating wounds. Kerecis products include Omega3 Wound, Omega3 Burn, and Omega3 Surgical. These products are made from fish (piscine) dermis designed fo r treating chronic wounds. A Hayes evolving evidence review for Kerecis Omega3 Wound (Kerecis Limited) for the management of chronic lower extremity wounds includes 3 poor quality and one fair quality study describing the clinical benefits of wound healin g. One randomized controlled trial (RCT) found better healing outcomes with Kerecis than a collagen -alginate dressing. One randomized controlled trial (RCT) found better healing outcomes with Kerecis than a collagen -alginate dressing. Additional RCTs are needed to determine if Kerecis \u00ae Omega3 Wound is better , worse, or the same as opposing alternatives, such as other animal- derived grafts. Kerecis\u00ae Omega3 Wound has been suggested and tested for use in additional applications; however, the focus of this report was restricted to its use in chronic wounds of the lower leg. Based on these current studies and the large number of identified ongoing studies, this technology's evidence base should be regarded as evolving and monitored for new publications . (Hayes 2022) An ECRI report for Omega3 Wound Matrix (Kerecis) for Treating Acute Wounds indicated that the evidence is inconclusive due to too few data on outcomes and comparisons of interest. A single center study and a single center case study was identified with major limitations and a high risk of bias . (ECRI Ap ril 2020) An ECRI report for Omega3 Wound Matrix (Kerecis) for Treating Chronic Wounds indicated that the evidence is inconclusive due to too few data on outcomes and comparisons of interest. Three studies (Michael et al., 2019; Dorweiler et al., 2018; Ya ng et al., 2016) were included which all resulted in high risk of bias . (ECRI Updated 2022 ) Luze et al. (2022) conducted a systematic review summarizing the current published evidence on the use of acellular fish skin (AFS) in the treatment of burn injuries. Acellular fish skin acts as a skin substitute, decreasing the inflammatory response and promoting proinflammatory cytokines that help wound healing. These properties might represent an effective treatment approach in burn wound management. A systematic review of the literature, up to March 2022, which resulted in 14 trials investigating the effects of acellular fish skin in burn wounds or split -thickness donor sites were determined eligible and included in the present review. Nile Tilapia were evaluated in seven of the trials and Kerecis \u00ae Omega3 (North Atlantic cod) was evaluated in five trials. Present evidence on the use of acellular fish skin shows an acceleration of wound healing, reductio n in pain and necessary dressing changes as well as improved a esthetic and functional outcomes compared to conventional treatment options. Study limitations includes a small size of study cohorts, and the results cannot be pooled; studies are Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 43 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC geographically limited based on availability of xenografts and comparison s tudies are needed between products. Acellular fish skin xenografts may be an effective treatment of superficial- and partial -thickness burns. Larger cohort studies are needed to clarify the full potential of this promising approach. Lullove et al. (2021) conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the fish skin graft with standard of care (SOC) using collagen alginate dressing in the management of treatment -resistant diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) not involving tendon capsule or bone. Patients with DFUs who were first treated with SOC (offloading, appropriate debridement, and moist wound care) for a 2 - week screening period were then randomized to either receiving SOC or SOC plus fish skin graft applied weekly for up to 12 weeks. The main endpoin t was the percentage of wounds closed at 12 weeks . Forty -nine patients were included in the final study. At 12 weeks, 16 of 24 patients' DFUs (67%) in the fish skin arm were completely closed, compared with 8 of 25 patients ' DFUs (32%) in the SOC arm ( p value = .0152 [ n = 49]; significant at p < .047). At 6 weeks, the percentage area reduction was 41.2% in the SOC arm and 72.8% in the fish skin arm. The application of fish skin graft to previously nonresponsive DFUs resulted in significantly more fully healed wounds at 12 weeks than SOC alone. Study limitations included small study population and intrinsic blinding where the patient and member applying the product was aware of knowing the fish skin graft was being applied. The study findings show favorable r esults for the use of fish skin graft for chronic DFUs that do not heal with SOC treatment. These findings need confirmed in a larger study population. Kirsner et al. (2020) in a prospective randomized controlled trial compared fish skin grafts to human amnion/chorion membrane allografts in acute would healing. Grafts can come from the patient's own skin (autograft), a human donor (allograft), or fro m a different species (xenograft). A fish skin xenograft from cold water fish (Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua) is a relatively new option that shows promising preclinical and clinical results in wound healing. Chronic wounds vary greatly in etiology and nature, requiring large cohorts for effective comparison between therapeutic alternatives. In this study, they at tempted to imitate the status of a freshly debrided chronic wound by creating acute full thickness wounds, 4 mm in diameter, on healthy volunteers to compare two materials frequently used to treat chronic wounds: fish skin and dHACM. The purpose is to give an indication of the efficacy of the two therapeutic alternatives in the treatment of chronic wounds in a simple, standardized, randomized, controlled, double blind study. All volunteers were given two identical punch biopsy wounds, one of which was treat ed with a fish skin graft and the other with dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane allograft (dHACM). In the study, 170 wounds were treated (85 wounds per group). The primary endpoint was defined as time to heal (full epithelialization) by blinded assessment at days 14, 18, 21, 25, and 28. The superiority hypothesis was that the fish skin grafts would heal the wounds faster than the dHACM. To evaluate the superiority hypothesis, a mixed Cox proportional hazard model was used. Wounds treated with fish skin healed significantly faster (hazard ratio 2.37; 95% confidence interval: (1.75 -3.22; p = 0.0014) compared with wounds treated with dHACM. The results show that acute biopsy wounds treated with fish skin grafts heal faster than wounds treated with dHACM. Limitations of this study included acute wounds from a punch biopsy rather than chronic non -healing wounds. Larger studies are needed to include participants with chronic unhealing wounds .

See above section titled Systematic Reviews, Meta -Analyses, Guidelines and Technology Assessments That Address Multiple Skin Substitutes for additional articles/reports that evaluate MatriStem. Frykberg et al. (2016) conducted a prospective, randomi zed, clinical study of at thirteen centers throughout the United States to assess the application of MatriStem Micr oMatrix (MSMM) (human fibroblast -derived dermal substitute) for the management of non -healing diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs).There were 95 s ubjects that entered into the standard of care (SOC) four -week screening phase of the trial and 56 of them were randomi zed into the treatment phase. This study was developed to evaluate the hypothesis that the wound outcomes observed after wound management with MS were non -inferior to those of DG after eight weeks. The authors present the planned interim results of this study after one half of the projected enrolment was completed. At the planned interim analysis, there was significant improvement in patien t quality of life for the subjects treated with MS compared with those managed with DG. However, there was not a statistically significant difference found during the analysis of the interim data between the two study groups for rate of wound healing or nu mber of subjects with complete wound closure. This study reports only interim results. Mediskin There is limited evidence related to the efficacy and long -term outcomes of Mediskin for treating wounds. Mediskin is a porcine derived decellularized fetal skin product. In a prospective randomized, 3 -arm, clinical study, Karlsson et al. (2014) compared Aquacel, Allevyn, and Mediskin I in the treatment of split -thickness skin graft donor sites in 67 adults. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with Aquacel, Allevyn, or Mediskin I. The donor site was assessed on postoperative days 3, 14, and 21 for healing, infection, pain, impact on everyday life, and ease of use. The obtained results demonstrate significantly faster re- epithelialization for patients treated with Aquacel or Mediskin I compared with Allevyn. Regarding infections, there were no significant differences between the groups. Patients wearing Aquacel experienced significantly less pain changing the dressing and less impact on everyday life t han the patients wearing Allevyn. According to the authors, Aquacel was shown to be significantly easier for the caregiver to use than Allevyn and Mediskin I. These findings require confirmation in a larger controlled trial.

MIRODERM (Miromatrix Medical) is a non -crosslinked acellular wound matrix that is derived from porcine liver and is processed and stored in a phosphate buffered aqueous solution. It is intended for the management of wounds. MIRRAGEN There are few published studies addressing the use of Mirragen. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Mirragen ha s a beneficial effect on health ou tcomes.

The material covers the wound, absorbs exudate, and provides a matrix or scaffold materi al that the body uses for revascularization and soft tissue regeneration. It is intended to be used to treat a variety of acute a nd chronic wounds including diabetic ulcers, pressure ulcers, vascular ulcers, trauma wounds, surgical incisions, and first - and second -degree burns. Armstrong et al. (2022a) in a randomized controlled trial investigated the healing potential of Mirragen Advanced Wound Matrix (BBGFM) in subjects with chronic DFUs comparing the healing rate to treatment with SOC (SOC, collagen alginat e dressing) alone at 12 weeks. Both groups received standard diabetic foot care including glucose monitoring, weekly debridements when needed and an offloading device. The primary endpoint was percentage of full- thickness, non- infected, non -ischemic wounds healed at 12 weeks, with secondary endpoints including percent area reduction (PAR) and changes in Semmes -Weinstein monofilament testing. The result illustrated in the intent -to-treat analysis at 12 weeks showed that 70% (14/20) of the BBGFM - treated DFUs healed compared with 25% (5/20) treated with SOC alone (adjusted p = .006). Mean PAR at 12 weeks was 79% in the BBGFM group compared with 37% in the SOC group (adjusted p = .027). Mean change in neuropathic score between baseline and up to 12 weeks of treatment was 2.0 in the BBGFM group compared with - 0.6 in the SOC group where positive improvement in scores is better (adjusted p = .008). The mean number of BBGFM applications was 6.0. In conclusion, adding BBGFM to SOC significantly improved wound healing with no adverse events related to treatment compared with SOC alone. While the design was robust, there were study weaknesses. The main weakness being lack of investigator binding and not withdrawing subjects that were not responding and providing them wit h a different treatment. In conclusion, this trial has established that the addition of a bioactive glass microfiber matrix containing boron to SOC results in suggestively improved wound healing in Wagner 1 DFUs compared with SOC alone, with hopeful result s regarding infection and neuropathy. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings. MLG -Complete There are no published studies addressing the use of MLG -Complete for wound treatment.

A Hayes report for Human Amniotic Membrane (HAM) Injections for Treatment of Chronic Plantar Fasciitis indicates that a low - quality body of evidence suggests that HAM injections may result in pain relief and improved function. None of the studies reviewed by Hayes evaluated the comparative effectiveness of amniotic tissue- derived treatments compared with other types of injections such as platelet -rich plasma or botulinum toxin, extracorporeal shockwave therapy, or surgery. Substantial uncertainty remains regarding the comparative effectiveness. The studies included for review had limited follow -up of 12 weeks or less, making it difficult to assess the long -term effects of this treatment. Double -blind RCTs w ith active treatment comparators (injectables, surgery, extracorporeal shockwave therapy) are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of amniotic tissue- derived allograft treatments for plantar fasciitis. The products evaluated in this report inclu ded PalinGen Sport FLOW, Clarix FLO, and AmnioFix . (Hayes, Human of Chronic Plantar Fasciitis, 2021 ) Hanselman et al. (2015) compared a novel treatment, cryopreserved human amniotic membrane (c -hAM), to a traditi onal treatment, corticosteroid. The hypothesis was that c -hAM would be safe and comparable to corticosteroids for plantar fasciitis (PF) in regard to patient outcomes. A randomized, controlled, double- blind, single- center pilot study was completed. Patient s were randomized into one of 2 treatment groups: c- hAM or corticosteroid. Patients received an injection at their initial baseline visit with an option for a second injection at their first 6 -week follow -up. Total follow -up was obtained for 12 weeks after the most recent injection. The primary outcome measurement was the Foot Health Status Questionnaire (FHSQ). The secondary outcome measurements were the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and verbally reported percentage improvement. Data were analyzed between grou ps for the 2 different cohorts (1 injection versus 2 injections). Twenty -three patients had complete follow - up. Fourteen were randomized to receive corticosteroid and 9 were randomized to receive c- hAM. Three patients in each group received second injectio ns. With the numbers available, the majority of outcome measurements showed no statistical difference between groups. The corticosteroid did, however, have greater FHSQ shoe fit improvement at 6 weeks, FHSQ general health improvement at 6 weeks, and verbally reported improvement at 12 weeks in the one- injection cohort. Cryopreserved hAM had greater FHSQ foot pain improvement at 18 weeks in the 2 -injection cohort. The authors concluded that cryopreserved hAM injection may be safe and comparable to corticosteroid injection for treatment of plantar fasciitis. According to the authors, this is a pilot study and requires further investigation. This study was not sufficiently powered t o detect between -group differences; therefore, no definitive conclusions can be made regarding the comparative effectiveness of c-hAM and corticosteroid treatment for patients with chronic PF. Study limitations include small sample size, no comparison of baseline characteristics, limited follow -up, and lack of power analysis. Zelen et al. (2013) reported the results of a randomized clinical trial examining the efficacy of micronized dehydrated human amniotic/chorionic membrane (mDHACM) injection as a treatment for chronic refractory plantar fasciitis. An institutional review board- approved, prospective, randomized, single -center clinical trial was performed. Forty -five patients were randomized to receive an injection of 2 cc 0.5% Marcaine plain, then either 1.25 cc mDHACM, or 1.25 cc mDHACM. Follow -up visits o ccurred over 8 weeks to measure function, pain, and functional health and well- being. Significant improvement in plantar fasciitis symptoms was observed in patients receiving 0.5 cc or 1.25 cc mDHACM versus controls within 1 week of treatment and throughou t the study period. At 1 -week , American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Hindfoot scores increased by a mean of 2.2 \u00b1 17.4 points for controls versus 38.7 \u00b1 11.4 points for those receiving 0.5 cc mDHACM and 33.7 \u00b114.0 points for those receiving 1.25 cc mDHACM. By week 8 AOFAS Hindfoot scores increased by a mean of 12.9 \u00b1 16.9 points for controls versus 51.6 \u00b1 10.1 and 53.3 \u00b1 9.4 for those receiving 0.5 cc and 1.25 cc mDHACM, respectively. No significant difference in treatment response was observed in patients receiving 0.5 cc versus 1.25 cc mDHACM. The authors Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 49 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC concluded that in patients with refractory plantar fasciitis, mDHACM is a viable treatment option. Study limitations include lack of a power analysis, small sample size, limited follow -up, lack o f an active comparator, and lack of blinding of outcome assessors. PermeaDerm B, PermeaDerm Glove or PermeaDerm C There are few published studies addressing the use of PermeaDerm B, PermeaDerm Glove or PermeaDerm C for any other indications. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether PermeaDerm B, PermeaDerm Glove or PermeaDerm C have a beneficial effect on health outcomes . PermeaDerm B, PermeaDerm CW and PermeaDerm Glove (Stedical Scientific ) are identical in chemical composition and 3D structure . They are all composed of a monofilament nylon knitted fabric bonded to a thin slitted silicone membrane. The nylon side of this dressing is coated with a mixture of hypoallergenic porcine gelatin and a pure fraction of Aloe vera The physica l differences in the two configurations (PermeaDerm B versus PermeaDerm CW and PermeaDerm Glove) are in the number and orientations of slits per unit area. PermeaDerm B is indicated for partial thickness burn wounds, donor sites and coverage of meshed autograft. PermeaD erm CW is indicated for partial thickness wounds, pressure sores, venous ulcers, diabetic ulcers, chronic vascular ulcers, surgical wounds (donor sites/grafts, post -Moh's, post -laser surgery, podiatric, wound dehiscence, trauma wounds (abrasions, laceratio ns, second -degree burns, and skin tears) and draining wounds. PermeaDerm Glove is indicated for debrided partial thickness hand burns . Phoenix Wound Matrix There are few published studies addressing the use of Phoenix Wound Matrix for any other indicatio ns. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Phoenix Wound Matrix has a beneficial effect on health outcomes . The Phoenix Wound Matrix (Nanofiber Solutions) is a sterile, single use device intended for the management of wounds. The Phoenix Wound Matrix is a conformable, non -woven, fibrous, three -dimensional matrix. The Phoenix Wound Matrix is made from two types o f polymer fibers: Poly(lactide- co-caprolactone) and Polyglycolic acid, which are bioabsorbed after degrading via hydrolysis. It is intended for use in the management of wounds. Wound types include: Partial and full thickness wounds, pressure ulcers, venous ulcers, diabetic ulcers, chronic vascular ulcers, tunneled/undermined wounds, surgical wounds (donor sites/grafts, post -Moh's surgery, post laser surgery, podiatric, wound dehiscence), trauma wounds (abrasions, lacerations, second degree burns, skin tears ) and draining wounds. Polycyte There are few published studies addressing the use of Polycyte for any other indications. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Polycyte has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Polycyte (Predictive Biotech) is a minimally manipulated human tissue allograft derived from the Wharton's jelly of the umbilical cord. It is intended for use in repair, reconstruction, replacement or supplementation of cells or tissue. PriMatrix There are several studies related to PriMatrix, all with study limitations. Although the evidence for this product is somewhat favorable, there is limited evidence related to the safety and long -term outcomes of this product. PriMatrix (Integra Life Scien ces, Inc.) is a bovine derived acellular dermal matrix indicated for the treatment of a variety of wounds. An ECRI report for PriMatrix Dermal Repair Scaffold for treating a variety of wounds (i.e., partial and full -thickness wounds; pressure, diabetic, and venous ulcers; second -degree burns; surgical, trauma, and draining wounds; tunneled/undermined wounds) indicated that evidence is inconclusive based on two small nonrandomized studies and four case series. One small study indicated that Primatrix resulted in faster healing than Apilgraf, but there is limited data and too high risk of bias to draw conclusions. All studies need validation in larger randomized trials that report more long -term effects . (ECRI, 2019) Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 50 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC Lantis et al. (2021) conducted a randomi zed controlled trial was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a fetal bovine acellular dermal matrix (FBADM) plus standard of care (SOC) for treating hard- to-heal diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). A prospective, multi- center randomized controlled trial was ca rried out. The study included a 2 -week run -in period, a 12 -week treatment phase and a 4-week follow -up phase. The primary endpoint was complete wound closure at 12 weeks. Twenty -one US sites enrolled and randomized 226 patients with hard- to-heal DFUs. The study was terminated early due to the COVID -19 pandemic, which led to a modified intent -to-treat (mITT) population of 207 patients, with 103 in the FBADM group and 104 in the SOC group. Of these participants, 161 completed the study per protocol (mPP popul ation), with 79 receiving FBADM, and 82 without. At the first analysis point, patients treated with FBADM were found to be significantly more likely to achieve complete wound closure compared with SOC alone (mITT: 45.6% versus 27.9% p 35.6% p = 0.002). The difference in outcome yielded an odds ratio of 2.2 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2, 3.9; p = 0.008). Median time to closure within 12 weeks was 43 days for the FBADM group compared to 57 days for the SOC group ( p = 0.36). The median number of applications of FBADM to achieve closure was one. Adverse events were similar between groups and no product -related serious adverse events occurred. Study limitations included the following: early termination of the study, lack of blindin g for both the investigator and the subject, subjects were only studied for four weeks post wound closure and selection bias since the subjects were healthier than most individuals with a DFU. Although these results include somewhat favorable results, additional studies are needed for validation in larger randomized trials that report more long -term effects . Sabolinski and Gibbons (2018) compared the effectiveness of bilayered living cellular construct (BLCC; Apligra) and an acellular fetal bovine collagen dressing (FBCD; Primatrix) for the treatment of venous leg ulcers. Data an electronic medical record (EMR) database was used to analyze 1021 refractory venous leg ulcers treated at 177 facilities. Kaplan -Meier analyses showed that BLCC (893 wounds ) was superior to FBCD (128 wounds) for: wound closure by weeks 12 (31 vs 25%), 24 (55 vs 43%) and 36 (68 vs 53%); reduction in time to wound closure of 37%, (19 vs 30 weeks); and improvement in the probability of healing by 45%. The authors concluded that BLCC versus FBCD showed significant differences in both time to and frequency of healing. A limitation of this study is that the use of EMR databases to collect data may introduce some reporting differen ces between or within centers. Information made available from all participating centers may not reflect uniform standards of patient assessments and standardization of general wound care practices. Procenta There are few published studies addressing the use of Procenta for wound treatment. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Procenta has a beneficial effect on health outcomes.

ProMatrX ACF (Amnio Technology, LLC) is a human allograft comprised of amnion and amniotic fluid that is intended to provide a liquid allograft to aid in the healing and repair of chronic wounds. PuraPly, PuraPly AM (formerly called FortaDerm) or PuraPly XT There are several studies related to PuraPly, PuraPly AM (formerly called FortaDerm), or PuraPly XT, all with study limitations. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether PuraPly, PuraPly AM (formerly called FortaDerm), or PuraPly XT has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 51 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC PuraPly (Organogenesis, Inc.) is a dressing made of porcine intestinal collagen matrix that is coated with polyhexamethylene biguanide hydrochloride (PHMB) antimicrobial agent. It is intended for wound care management. Bain et al. ( 2020) evaluated the effectiveness of purified native type I collagen matrix plus polyhexamethylene biguanide antimicrobial (PCMP) (PuraPly AM) on cutaneous wounds by conducting a prospective cohort study of 307 patients (67 venous leg ulcers, 62 diabetic f oot ulcers, 45 pressure ulcers, 54 postsurgical wounds and 79 other wounds). Cox wound closure for PCMP was 73% at week 32. The median time to wound closure was 17 weeks (Kaplan -Meier). The incidence of PCMP -treated wounds showing > 60% reductions in areas , depths and volumes were 81, 71 and 85%, respectively. The authors concluded that PCMP demonstrated clinically meaningful benefits to patients with various types of cutaneous wounds. This study is limit ed because there was no comparator treatment group. A Hayes report on Puraply indicated that the quantity of published, peer -reviewed clinical data is insufficient to evaluate PuraPly AM for chronic lower extremity ulcers in a full assessment . (Hayes, PuraPly Antimicrobial (AM) Wound Matrix (Organogenesis Inc.) for Treatment of Wounds, 202 2) A 2022 ECRI report for PuraPly AM Antimicrobial Wound Matrix for treating chronic wounds indicates that evidence is inconclusive. T hree small cases series with a high risk of bias noted that PuraPly AM along with standa rd wound care achieved complete wound closure in about one- third to two -thirds of chronic wounds with different etiologies within 5 to 7 weeks. The studies are at a very high risk of bias due to small sample size, single center, lack of controls, binding a nd randomization. The studies were lacking in long -term outcomes and patient -oriented outcomes. Large m ulticenter randomized controlled trials are needed that address long -term and cosmetic outcomes as well as complications. REGUaRD There are no published studies addressing the use of REGUard. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether REGUard has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. REGUaRD (New Life Medical, LLC) is a hydrated acellular (human) dermal allograft matrix used for the treatment of non -healing wounds and bum injuries. It contains extracellular matrix (ECM) that provides a scaffold for cellular ingrowth vascularizatio n, tissue regeneration and formation of granulation tissue. Relese There are no published studies addressing the use of Relese for wound treatment. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Relese has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Relese is a sheet skin substitute product that contains non -viable cells and is intended for use as a selective barrier and to protect wounds from the surrounding environment for chronic and acute wounds including dermal ulcers and other defects. Repriza There are few published studies addressing the use of Repriza. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Repriza has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Repriza (Promethean Life Sciences, Inc) is an acellular dermal matrix prepared from human skin allograft. Repriza is intended for implantation for reconstructive surgery wherever an acellular dermal matrix may be used, for example in abdominal wall reconstruction, and augmentation of soft tissue irregularities. Cockcroft and Markelov (2018) followed 11 patients in a retrospective cohort study for a minimum of 6 weeks (mea n, 12 weeks). The patients had undergone a trapeziectomy with interpositional arthroplasty using Repriza acellular dermal matrix to treat primary and secondary carpometacarpal joint arthritis. Subjective and objective data were collected to assess pain, subjective improvement of symptoms, radiographic measurements of first metacarpal subsidence, key pinch strength, grip strength, and range of motion. Early outcomes compared favorably to other treatment series. On average, patients received a significant pain reduction of 63%, with 36% of patients admitting to complete pain resolution. All patients had an overall subjective improvement in symptoms. Ninety -one percentage of patients achieved postoperative opposition of the thumb and fifth digit. Comparison wit h preoperative x -rays showed mean thumb metacarpal deformity and extra -articular acellular dermal matrix migration, due to lack of patient compliance with splint, were observed complications. Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 52 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC The authors concluded that this technique is safe and effective for Eaton grades III and IV thumb carpometacarpal arthritis. Long -term study with a larger sample size is needed to investigate this technique further. Restorigin There are few published studies addressing the use of Restorigin. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Restorigin has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. The Restorigin Amnion Patch (Parametrics Medical) is derived from the amnion layer of fetal membranes in the umbilical cord. It is intended to provide protection as well as a tissue matrix to reduce inflammation and scarring for individuals with chronic, non-healing wounds and burns. Restrata There are few published studies addressing the use of Restrata. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude wheth er Restrata has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Restrata is a synthetic, resorbable fiber matrix that resembles human extracellular matrix (ECM) and acts as a scaffold mater ial the body uses for revascularization and soft tissue regeneration. It is intended to treat wounds such as diabetic, venous, and pressure ulcers, as well as second -degree burns and other traumatic wounds. Regulski and MacEwan (2018) conducted a retrospective review in a single center to evaluate the efficacy and utility of th e implantable nanomedical scaffold in the treatment of chronic, nonhealing lower extremity wounds in patients with multiple comorbidities. Data were retrospectively collected via chart review by the treating physician. A total of 82 wounds were included in this study; wound types consisted of 34 diabetic foot ulcers, 34 venous leg ulcers, and 14 other wounds. Overall, treated wounds demonstrated progressive and sustained wound area reduction over the course of treatment, with 85% achieving complete closure at 12 weeks. Limitations included the following: this was an initial review of the implantable nanomedical scaffold and lack of a control group and randomization, which limit the ability to draw conclusions about the effectiveness o f the scaffold. Addition al research is needed along with large, randomized control studies to further predict efficacy and safety. Revita There are few published studies addressing the use of Revita. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Revita has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Revita (StimLabs, LLC.) is a sterilized, dehydrated human placental allograft. It is intended to be used as a wound covering, or barrier membrane, over chronic and acute wounds, including dermal ulcers. It also has clinical applicati ons in dentistry, ophthalmology, and orthopedics. Revitalon There are few published studies addressing the use of Revitalon for wound treatment.

Signature APatch (Signature Biologics) is a cryopreserved tissue derived from amniotic membrane for homologous use as a wound coverin g. Signature APatch can separate the underlying tissue from the external environment. SkinTE There are few published studies addressing the use of SkinTE for wound treatment. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether SkinTE has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 53 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC SkinTE (PolarityTE, Inc.) is a fully autologous, homologous skin product intended to be used for the repair, reconstruction, replacement, supplementation, or regeneration of defects or functional losses of the skin. SkinTE is manufactu red from a harvested sample of the patient's full- thickness skin, composed of viable skin cells and an organized extracellular matrix, with no additional cell or tissue source from another human (allogeneic) or different species (xenogeneic). The product is intended for treatment of acute burns requiring excision, grafting, and chronic wounds. An ECRI report for SkinTE for Treating Acute and Chronic Wounds indicated that the evidence for SkinTE is inconclusive because no evidence is available. (ECRI, 2018) STRATTICE There are several studies related to Strattice, all with study limitations. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Strattice has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. STRATTICE (Allergan) is a porcine derived acellular dermal bio logical mesh intended for use as a soft tissue patch to reinforce soft tissue where weakness exists and for the surgical repair of damaged or ruptured soft tissue membranes. It is intended fo r the repair of hernias and/or body wall defects which require th e use of reinforcing or bridging material to obtain the desired surgical outcome. Jakob et al. (2020) conducted a two -arm randomized study to compare the outcome after prophylactic, intraperitoneal implantation of a biologic Strattice mesh with standard abdominal closure in patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to prophylactic implantation of a biological intraperitoneal mesh using Strattice (mesh group) or standard abdominal closure using a single, continuous ru nning suture (no mesh group). Because of safety concerns, patient enrollment had to be closed prematurely. Eligibility for inclusion was assessed in 61 patients. A total of 48 patients were randomized (21 in the mesh group, 28 in the no -mesh group). No dif ferences in baseline characteristics were found. Abdominal wall complications requiring re- operations were more frequent in the mesh group compared to the no mesh group (5 of 13 [83.3%] vs 1 of 13 [14.3%] patients, p = 0.026). Mesh -associated abdominal wal l complications included non - integration of the mesh into the abdominal wall, dissolution of the mesh, and mesh -related infections. The investigators concluded that in patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery, intraperitoneal biologic Strattice mesh implantation is associated with significantly more frequent abdominal wall complications requiring re- operation. Therefore, the use of such meshes cannot be recommended in the contaminated environment of emergency abdominal surgery. In a cohort study, Kaufmann et al. (2020) evaluated the clinical efficacy and patient satisfaction following Strattice placement in complex abdominal wall hernia repair (CAWHR). The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical efficacy and patient satisfactio n following Strattic e placement in patients treated for CAWHR in three academic and peripheral hospitals in Germany. Patients underwent abdominal examination, an ultrasound was performed, and patients completed quality -of-life questionnaires. Twenty - seven patients were asses sed (14 male, age 67.5 years, follow -up 42.4 months). The most frequent postoperative complication was wound infection (39.1%). Strattice did not have to be removed in any of the patients. Four patients had passed away. During outpatient clinic visit, six out of 23 patients (26.1%) had a recurrence of hernia, one patient had undergone reoperation. Five patients (21.7%) had bulging of the abdominal wall. Quality -of-life questionnaires revealed that patients judged their scar with a median 3.5 out of 10 point s (0 = best) and judged their restrictions during daily activities with a median of 0 out of 10.0 (0 = no restriction). The investigators indicated that despite a high rate of wound infection, no biological mesh had to be remo ved. According to the authors, in some cases the biological meshes provided a safe way out of desperate clinical situations. Both the recurrence rate and the amount of bulging were high (failure rate 47.8%). Since the design of this study is a cross -sectional cohort study, data were partly retrospective and partly prospectively collected. This could have led to a bias in the study results. Maxwell et al. (2019) used a prospectively maintained database to compare Fortiva, Hernia recurrence and surgical site occurrence (SSO) were the primary and secondary endpoints. Kaplan -Meier survival curves and logistic regression models were used to evaluate risks for hernia recurrence and SSO. A total of 229 patients underwent AWR with 1 of 3 ADMs. Median follow -up time was 20.9 months (1-60 months). Cumulative recurrence rates for each mesh were 6.9%, 11.2%, and 22.0% for Fortiva, Strattice, and Alloderm groups. Surgical site occurrence for each mesh was 56.9%, 49.0%, and 49.2%, respectively. Seroma was significantly lower in the Fortiva group (1.4%). Independent risk factors hernia recurrence included body mass index of 30 kg/m or higher and hypertension. Adjusted risk factors included oncologic resectio n for hernia recurrence and a wound class of contaminated or dirty/infected for SSO. The authors concluded that acellular dermal matrices provide a durable repair with low overall rate o f recurrence and complications in AWR. The study found that the recurr ence and complication profiles differ between brands. Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 54 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC These results need to be confirmed by prospective randomized trials. The limitation of this study is the absence of a control arm to compare biological mesh reconstruction with other techniques of abdom inal wall reconstruction. Trippoli et al. (2018) conducted a meta -analysis to evaluate the treatment of primary and incisional ventral hernia using biologic meshes. The study consisted of the following phases: a) Identification of the biologic meshes ava ilable on the market; b) Literature search focused on efficacy and safety of these meshes; c) Analysis of the findings derived from the literature sea rch. The information was reviewed and presented according to standard meta- analysis. The main endpoints of the analysis included infection of surgical wound at 1 month and recurrence at 12 months. Eleven trials that evaluated 5 biological meshes were identified: Permacol (706 patients), Strattice (324 patients), Tutomesh (38 patients) a nd Xenmatrix (22 patients). These studies generally showed a poor methodological quality, and surgical wound infection showed wide range between studies variability. A significantly lower rate of recurrence at 12 months was found for Permacol compared with Strattice. The authors concluded that the different types of meshes showed a marked statistical variability in the clinical outcomes, and nearly all comparisons between different meshes in the two clinical endpoints did not reach statistical significance. These findings are in line with those of a recent consensus review from a European working group (Kockerling et al., 2018) that does not recommend the routine use of biologic meshes for abdominal wall reconstruction. The study conducted by Huntington et a l., 2016 which was previously cited in this policy is included in the Trippoli et al., 2018 meta -analysis. Stravix and StravixPL There are several studies related to Stravix and StravixPL, all with study limitations. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Stravix and/or StravixPL has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Stravix and Stravix PL ( Osiris Therapeutics, Inc.) are thicker versions of Grafix PRIME and GrafixPL PRIME. These products use umbilical amnion and Wharton's Jelly to su pport wound repair. Stravix and Stravix PL are intended for treating ulcers, burns, Pyoderma Gangrenosum, Epidermolysis Bulosa, and other types of for Stravix Cryopreserved Placental a cryopreserved amniotic membrane graft derived from human placenta and is intended for treating wounds and repairing connective tissue defects. The graft is purported to be minimally processed to retain the amnion's native cells and extracellular matrix. Stravix is intended as a substitute for skin autografts when harvesting skin is infeasible, impractical, or risky to the patient. Supra SDRM There are no published studies addressing the use of Supra SDRM for wound treatment. Therefore, it is not possi ble to conclude whether Supra SDRM has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. SUPRA SDRM \u00ae is a novel synthetic, guided wound closure matrix, built as a bimodal foam membrane structure for the management of chronic wounds. SUPRATHEL There are several st udies related to SUPRATHEL, all with study limitations. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether SUPRATHEL has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. SUPRATHEL\u00ae is indicated in superficial (2a\u00b0) and deep dermal/partial thickness (2b\u00b0) skin loss diseases, such as burn wounds, split-thickness skin graft (STSG) donor sites, as well as trauma and surgical wounds. An ECRI 2021 clinical evidence assessment for Suprathel Skin Substitute (PolyMedics Innovations GmbH) for Treating Donor Site Wounds sugge st that Suprathel is safe, but whether it improves patient outcomes compared with other dressings cannot be determined because available studies are at high risk of bias and assess too few patients per comparison. There was one randomized controlled trial (RCT) and 2 comparison studies. Comparison multicenter RCTs comparing Suprathel with other donor site wound treatments that report on pain, infection rates, and wound healing are needed to assess comparative effectiveness, but none are ongoing. ( Schwarz 2007 and Markl 2010 included in this report) Blome -Eberwein et al. (2021) in a retrospective chart review from a single center burn center reviewed Suprathel, a new bio - degradable synthetic membrane that was recently introduced to treat second degree burn s in adults and pediatric patients. There were 229 burn patients (141 male, 88 females, (138 pediatric)) with a mean age of 18 years (9 weeks to 73 years) were Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 55 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC included in the study. 474 sheets of the synthetic membrane were applied to second degree burns (superficial and deep). The average burn size was 8.9% (range 1 to 60% TBSA. The wound bed was prepped with either rough debridement or dermabrasion. After hemostasis, the membrane was applied to the wound with an outer dressing of fatty gauze, bridal veil, absorptive gauze followed by an ACE \u00ae wrap. The outer dressing was removed every one to four days, depending on exudate, in order to closely follow the wound through the translucent membrane and fatty gauze layers. After epithelialization, the dress ing separated and could be removed. The study focused on the need for subsequent grafting, healing time, patient pain level, hypertrophic scarring and rate of infection. All wounds in this study that were treated with Suprathel\u00ae healed without grafting. The aver age TBSA (Total Body Surface Area) was 8.9% (1% -60%). Average time to healing was 13.7 days for 90% epithelialization with 11.9 days for pediatric patients versus 14.7 days for adults. Throughout the treatment period, the average pain level was 1.9 on a 10- point scale. 27 patients developed hypertrophic scarring in some areas (11.7%). Average Length of stay (LOS) was 6.9 days. The rate of infection was 3.8% (8/229). Failure or progression to full thickness in part of the woun ds was 5.2% (12/229). Limitati ons were that of any retrospective study in addition to no control group. Author's note that Suprathel is a good treatment option when treating second degree burns. It's a basic treatment that provides a physiologic healing environment with good outcomes a nd less pain than previously used options used by the providers at the same institution. Authors indicate that a prospective long - term outcome study with control group is in preparation to confirm these preliminary findings. Hundeshagen et al. (2018) in a prospective single center randomized controlled trial compared Mepilex Ag (M), a silver - impregnated foam dressing, and Suprathel (S), a DL -lactic acid polymer, in the outpatient treatment of partial- thickness burns in pediatric and adult patients. Repith elialization, wound pain and discomfort during dressing changes were observed. Objective scar characteristics (elasticity, transepidermal water loss, hydration, and pigmentation) and subjective assessments (Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale) were measured at 1 month post burn. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM, and significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Sixty -two patients (S n = 32; M n = 30) were enrolled; age, sex, and burn size were comparable between the groups. Time to reepithelialization was no t different between the groups (12 days; p = 0.75). Pain ratings were significantly reduced during the first 5 days after burn in the Suprathel group in all patients ( p = 0.03) and a pediatric subgroup ( p < 0.001). Viscolelasticity of burned skin was eleva ted compared with unburned skin in the Mepilex Ag group at 1 month post burn. Patients treated with Suprathel reported better overall scar quality (S: 2; M: 4.5; p < 0.001). Both dressings are feasible and useful for the outpatient treatment of minor and s elected moderate partial- thickness burns. Study limitations included results that were assessed by clinical judgement rather than objective assessment tools such as doppler, there were a number of participants that did not report at later points of the stu dy and there was no blinding to the study personnel. Further studies on this treatment are warranted. Markl et al. (2010) in an open label single- center randomized controlled trial evaluated 3 different synthetic wound dressings for treating split -thickne ss skin graft donor sites. Seventy -seven partic ipants were randomly assigned to 3 study groups: Suprathel, Biatain -Ibu, Mepitel. Wounds were inspected daily until complete reepithelization. Ease of care and scar development after a 6 - month follow -up were evaluated. Suprathel showed significant ( p 0.001) pain reduction after 24 hours but increasing pain scores on the 5th day of treatment. Biatain -Ibu showed significant pain relief immediately after application and during the entire treatment period ( p < 0.05). Mepitel did not show any significant pain reduction. There were no significant differences in the re- epithelization period of the 3 dressing materials. Further studies are warranted. Schwarze et al. (2007) conducted a prospective, randomized, two cen ter clinical study to evaluate the impact on wound healing of Suprathel in donor sites of split -thickness skin grafts. Suprathel represents an absorbable, synthetic wound dressing with properties of natural epithelium. Twenty -two burn patients who were tre ated with split -thickness skin grafts, and with a mean age of 39.6 years were included in the study. Donor sites of skin grafts were randomly selected; partly treated with Jelonet and partly treated with Suprathel. First gauze change was carried out the fi fth day postoperatively followed by regular wound inspection until complete re- epithelization. The study focused on patient pain score, healing time, analysis of wound bed and ease of care. No significant difference in healing time of the graft donor sites was detected between Suprathel \u00ae and Jelonet. The mean 10 -day pain score was 0.92 (median: 1.0; range: 0.2 - 1.8) in the Suprathel\u00ae group, and 2.1 (median: 2.8; range: 0.4 - 3.0) in the Jelonet\u00ae group. These scores were statistically significant (p = 0.0002). There was a significantly lower pain score for patients treated with Suprathel ( p = 0.0002). Suprathel became transparent when applied and allowed close monitoring of wound healing. In contrast to Jelonet, Suprathel showed excellent plasticity with better attachment and adherence to wound surfaces. Throughout the healing process it detached from wounds without damaging the new epithelial surface. In addition, wound areas treated with Suprathel required less frequent dressing changes. It also demonstrated e ase of care. Limitations included a small sample size, lack of blinding, participants were their own control group(both dressings applied to different Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 56 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC areas of the same wound) and subjective reporting outcomes.

Talymed There are few published studies addressing the use of Talymed. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Talymed has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Talymed is a wound care management product composed of shortened fibers of poly Nacetyl glucosamine (pGIcNAc) isolated from microalgae. It is indicated for the management of a range of serious, complex wounds. See above section titled Systematic Reviews, Meta -Analyses, Guidelines and Technology Assessments That Address Multiple Skin Substitutes for additional articles/reports that evaluate TalyMed. Kelechi et al. (2012) conducted a randomized controlled investigator blinded pilot study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of an advanced, poly -N-acetyl glucosamine (pGlcNAc), nanofiber -derived, wound -healing technology (Talymed) among patients with venous leg ulcers (VLUs) compared to treatment with standard care plus pGlcNAc (applied only once, every other week, or every 3 weeks) or to standard care alone. The results showed among the 82 randomized patients, 71 completed the study with 7 lost to follow -up and 4 discontinued because of systemic infection. There were no significant group differences wit h regard to baseline demographic, illness, and VLU characteristics. At 20 weeks, the proportion of patients with completely healed VLUs was 45.0% (9 of 20), 86.4% (19 of 22), and 65.0% (13 of 20) for groups receiving standard care plus pGlcNAc only once, every other week, and every 3 weeks, respectively, versus 45.0% (9 of 20) for those receiving standard care alone. The advanced wound- healing technology was well tolerated and safe. The authors concluded that the results of this pilot study suggest that the pGlcNAc advanced wound- healing technology is well tolerated and effective. This study was limited by the small sample size and patients unblinded to treatment allocation. Further research with randomized controlled trials is needed to validate these findings.

It is intended to treat wounds such as diabetic, venous, and pressure ulcers, as well as second -degree burns and other traumatic wounds. Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 58 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC TheraSkin There are several studies related to TheraSkin, all with study limitations. Although the evidence for this product is somewhat favorable, larger more robust studies are needed. TheraSkin (Solsys Medical) is an extracellular dermal matrix proposed for multiple healing indications. It contains human collagen, fibroblasts, growth factors, keratinocytes and cytokines. Refer to the above section titled Systematic Reviews, Meta -Analyses, Guidelines and Technology Assessments That Address Multiple Skin Substitutes for additional articles/reports that evaluate TheraSkin. In a prospective randomized controlled trial, Armstrong et al. (2022b) is study compared the healing potential of Theraskin (BSA) in subjects with chronic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), compared to treatment with SOC alone. There were 100 subjects with non- healing DFUs of which 50 were treated with a cryopreserved bioactive sp lit thickness skin allograft (BSA) and 50 subjects were treated with standard of care (SOC, collagen alginate dressing) at 12 weeks. Both groups received standardized care that included glucose monitoring, weekly debridement's as appropriate, and an offloa ding device. The primary endpoint was proportion of full -thickness wounds healed at 12 weeks, with secondary endpoints including differences in percent area reduction (PAR) at 12 weeks, changes in Semmes -Weinstein monofilament score, VAS pain, and w -QoL. T he result illustrated in the intent -to-treat analysis at 12 weeks showed that 76% (38/50) of the BSA -treated DFUs healed compared with 36% (18/50) treated with SOC alone (adjusted p = .00056). Mean PAR at 12 weeks was 77.8% in the BSA group compared with 49.6% in the SOC group (adjusted p = .0019). While the design was robust, there were study weaknesses. The main weakness being lack of investigator blinding and adding a third cohort would allow for a comparison between products. In conclusion, adding BSA t o SOC was more likely to heal wounds during the initial 12 weeks of treatment with less adverse events. Upcoming studies should include more robust studies with investigator blinding, a comparison group as well as complex wounds to confirm these results . Barbul et al. (2019) conducted a retrospective, matched cohort study to evaluate the effectiveness of Theraskin, a cryopreserved bioactive split -thickness skin allograft plus standard of care when compared to standard of care alone. Data was extracted fro m a patient pool of 650,309 diabetic ulcers at 470 wound care centers. Propensity -matched cohorts were used to ensure that the treatment group and control group had similar characteristics. There were 778 wounds treated with bioactive split-thickness skin allograft (BSA) that were matched to 778 standard of care cohorts. Both cohorts received standard of care. Logistic regression analysis of healing rates according to wound size, wound location, wound duration, volume reduction, exposed deep structures, and Wagner grade was performed. Amputation rates and reoccurrences at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after wound closure were analyzed. Diabetic ulcers were 59% more likely to close in the treatment cohort compared to the control cohort (p = 0.0045). The heal ing rate with the graft was better than standard of care across multiple subclasses, but the most significant improvement was noted in the worst wounds that had a duration of 90 -179 days prior to treatment (p = 0.0073), exposed deep structures (p = 0.036), and/or Wagner Grade 4 ulcers (p = 0.04). Also, the decrease in recidivism was statistically significant at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year, with and without initially exposed deep structures (p < 0.05). T he amputation rate in the treatment cohort was 41.7% less than that of the control cohort at 20 weeks (0.9% vs. 1.5%, respectively). This study demonstrated that diabetic ulcers treated with a cryopreserved bioactive split -thickness skin allograft were more likely to heal and remain closed compared to ulcer s treated with standard of care alone. There were study limitations as a result of the data being obtained retrospectively from electronic medical records. This has the potential for inaccuracies, lack of information regarding treatment, wound description, limb vascularity and HbA1C. Another limitation is possibly the lack of direct comparison to other products and/or other advanced treatments. An ECRI report for TheraSkin Human Skin Allograft indicated that the evidence for this product is inconclusive b ecause there is not enough data . Evidence from three very small comparative studies and two case series needs validation in larger multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that report patient -oriented outcomes and address each wound type to draw con clusions. Several large ongoing registry studies might provide some evidence to further elucidate the efficacy of TheraSkin allografts for treating various wound types . (ECRI, 2019) In a pilot prospective, head -to-head, single site, randomized clinical tr ial, Towler et al. (2018 ; reviewed in ECRIB report above) evaluated the effectiveness of 2 biologically active grafts, TheraSkin and Apligraf, in conjunction with compression therapy to treat venous leg ulcers (VLUs). The study, not industry -sponsored, was designed to assess differences in healing rates, and adverse outcomes. A total of 31 subjects were enrolled and randomized into 1 of the 2 cohorts. There were 4 subjects who were randomized but then dropped out of the study. The healing rates were different but not statistically significant and there were no adverse outcomes. According to the authors, this suggests that TheraSkin may provide equivalent or superior Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 59 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC outcomes to Apligraf. This study is at risk of selection bias due to a small sample size. The authors indicated that because this is a pilot study, it was designed to only give a general feel for the differences in performance of these 2 treatment options . Treadwell et al. (2018 ; review ed in ECRI report above ) conducted a real -world setting analysis to compare the effectiveness of a bioengineered living cellular construct (BLCC; Apligraf) to a cryopreserved allograft treatment of venous leg ulcers (VLUs). Treatment reco rds were collected from a large wound care- specific electronic medical record database on 717 patients (799 VLUs) receiving treatment at 177 wound care centers. Ulcers 28 day's duration, between 1 and <40cm2 that closed 40% within the 28 days befor e treatment were included. Patient baseline demographics and wound characteristics were comparable between groups. The median time to wound closure was 52% faster with BLCC compared with CCSA (15 weeks vs. 31 weeks). In addition, the proportion of wounds h ealed was significantly higher for BLCC by 12 weeks (42% vs. 24%) and 24 weeks (65% vs. 41%). Treatment with BLCC increased the probability of healing by 97% compared with CCSA. According to the authors, this is the first real- world comparative effectiveness analysis to evaluate BLCC and CCSA for the treatment of VLUs. The authors concluded that t reatment with a bioengineered cellular technology significantly improved the incidence and speed of wound closure compared with a CCSA. A limitation of this study is that the use of EMR databases to collect data may introduce some reporting differences between or within centers. Information made available from all participating centers may not reflect uniform standards of patient assessments and standardization of g eneral wound care practices. DiDomenico et al. (2011 ; reviewed in ECRI report above) evaluated whether the rate of wound closure and the number of grafts required would be the same when treating diabetic foot ulcers with TheraSkin, a cryopreserved split -thickness skin allograft (SSA), as compared to Apligraft, a bioengineered skin substitute (BSS). A prospective study using sequentially enrolled patients seen in a large podiatric practice encompassing multiple locations was conducted. Patients were sequent ially enrolled and treated with either BSS or SSA. All other factors of treatment were standardized across the patient population. Data analysis included an analysis of co -factors in each group in order to determine if anything else may have influenced the outcomes. Data from 17 wounds (16 patients) treated with BSS and 12 wounds treated with SSA were analyzed. The average wound sizes were comparable, as was the average number of applications utilized. The authors reported a higher incidence of ulcer healin g after 20 weeks in the TheraSkin group (66.7%) compared with the Apligraf group (47.1%), although this difference was not statistically significant. This study was uncontrolled and limited by a small sample size. Landsman et al. (2011 ; reviewed in ECRI r eport above ) conducted a retrospective study of 188 subjects, with 134 venous leg ulcers (VLUs) and 54 diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) comparing the safety and efficacy of TheraSkin as an alternative to bioengineered skin substitutes such as Apligraf and Derma graft. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between baseline wound size and the proportion of healed wounds after 12 and 20 weeks from initial allograft application. The authors found that by the 12th week, DFUs closed 60. 38% of the time and VLUs closed 60.77% of the time. After 20 weeks, the number of closed DFUs increased to 74.1% and the number of VLUs increased to 74.6%. The mean wound size in the DFU group was 6.2 cm in the VLU group. The mean number of TheraSkin allog rafts required ranged from 1 to 8, with an average of 2.03 at the 12- week point and an average of 3.23 at the 20 -week point. Multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate the odds of wound healing by week 12 and week 20 in each group. The authors also analyzed AEs and found TheraSkin to be noncontributory to any adverse events, verifying the safety of TheraSkin in this study population. The author s concluded that TheraSkin has been shown to be highly effective for the treatment of both VLUs and DFU s with an acceptable safety profile. Further research with randomized controlled trials is needed to validate these findings. Therion There are few published studies addressing the use of Therion. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether Therion has a beneficial effect on health outcomes. Therion (MISONIX) is a dehydrated and terminally sterilized allograft wound covering derived from human placental membrane used to treat chronic wounds. TransCyte TransCyte (Organogenesis, Inc.), formally known as Dermagraft TC, is a human fibroblast -derived temporary wound cover consisting of human dermal fibroblasts grown on nylon mesh, combined with a synthetic epidermal layer. As the fibroblasts proliferate within the nylon mesh, they secrete h uman dermal collagen, matrix proteins and growth factors. Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 60 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC Pham et al. (2007) conducted a systematic review of skin substitutes for the management of burn injuries. A total of 20 randomized controlled trials were included in the review. The evidence sugges ted that bioengineered skin substitutes, namely TransCyte, Biobrane, Dermagraft, and allogeneic cultured skin, were at least as efficacious as topical agents/wound dressings or allograft . The investigators indicated that there were several methodological l imitations across the available studies, which hampered the overall conclusions. According to the investigators, additional well- designed randomized controlled trials with sufficient long -term follow up are necessary to strengthen the overall evidence rega rding the efficacy of tissue- engineered skin substitutes. In a prospective, randomized, comparison study, Noordenbos et al. (1999) evaluated TransCyte, formerly marketed as Dermagraft -Transitional Covering, for the treatment of partial- thickness burns. A comparison study of silver sulfadiazine and TransCyte was performed with the use of paired wound sites on 14 patients. Wounds treated with TransCyte healed more quickly (mean 11.14 days to 90% epithelialization vs 18.14 days). A non -comparison evaluation was then done for an additional 18 patients, and it confirmed excellent wound healing and an absence of infections. There were no infections in the 32 wound sites treated with TransCyte. In the first study group, late wound evaluations (3, 6, and 12 months postburn) were performed with use of the Vancouver Scar Scale. The results indicated that wound sites treated with TransCyte healed with less hypertrophic scarring than sites treated with silver sulfadiazine. In a randomized prospective study, Demling an d DeSanti (1999) compared the effect of standard topical antibiotic management versus a biological skin substitute wound closure (TransCyte) for mid -partial thickness burns of the face. Twenty - one adult patients with mid- dermal facial burns produced by flash flames or flame exposure were included in the study. Total daily burn care time, pain (0 -10 scale) and healing time were monitored. Immediately after partial thickness debridement, the entire face burn, including ears, was closed with a bioengineered sk in substitute coated with fibronectin (TransCyte) ( n = 10) or treated by the open technique using bacitracin ointment applied 2 -3 times daily ( n = 11). The authors found a significant decrease in wound care time (0.35 +/ - 0.1 versus 1.9 +/ - 0.5 h), decreas e in pain of 2 +/ - 1 versus 4 +/ - 2 and re -epithelialization time (7 +/ - 2 versus 13 +/ - 4 days) in the skin substitute group compared to topical antibiotics group. The authors concluded that a bioengineered skin substitute significantly improves the manag ement and healing rate of partial thickness facial burns compared to the standard open topical ointment technique.

Clinical Practice Guidelines Society for Vascular Su rgery/American Podiatric Medical Association/Society for Vascular Medicine (SVS/APMA/SVM) The SVS/APMA/SVM published a joint evidence- based guideline for the management of patients with diabetes, including treatment of diabetes related chronic foot ulcers . (Hingorani et al., 2016) These organizations recommended the following: Standard wound therapy for diabetic ulcers includes moist dressings, offloading and debridement. For diabetic foot ulcers that fail to demonstrate improvement (> 50% wound area reduction) after a minimum of 4 weeks of standard wound therapy, adjunctive wound therapy options include biologics (platelet -derived growth factor, living cellular therapy, extracellular matrix products, amniotic membrane products). The choice of adjuvant therapy is based on clinical findings, availability of therapy, and cost -effectiveness; there is no recommendation on ordering of therapy choice. Re- evaluation of vascular status, infection control, and offloading is recommended to ensure optimization bef ore initiation of adjunctive wound therapy (Grade 1B). Consideration of living cellular therapy using a bilayered keratinocyte/fibroblast construct or a fibroblast -seeded matrix for treatment of diabetic foot ulcers when the individual is recalcitrant to s tandard therapy (Grade 2B). Consideration of the use of extracellular matrix products employing acellular human dermis or porcine small intestinal submucosal tissue as an adjunctive therapy for diabetic foot ulcers when the individual is recalcitrant to st andard therapy (Grade 2C). Wound Healing Society (WHS) The WHS has published updated evidence- based guidelines on the treatment of diabetic ulcers. Regarding the use of skin substitutes, the WSH concluded that level I evidence suggests that cellular and a cellular skin equivalents improve the healing of diabetes -related foot ulcers. The underlying principle is that healthy living skin cells assist in the healing foot ulcers by releasin g therapeutic amounts of growth factors, cytokines, and other proteins th at stimulate the wound bed. (Lavery et al., 2016) In evidence- based guideline for venous ulcers , the WHS stated that there is evidence that a bilayered living human skin equivalent, used in conjunction with compression bandaging, increases the incidence a nd speed of healing for venous ulcers compared with compression and a simple dressing (Level I evidence). The WHS recommends adequate wound bed preparation and control of excess bioburden levels prior to application of a biologically active dressing. They also noted that cultured epithelial autografts or allografts have not been demonstrated to improve stable healing of venous ulcers (Level I). The WHS also stated that there is Level II evidence that a porcine small intestinal submucosal construct may enhan ce healing of venous ulcers . (Marston et al., 2016) National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) The clinical guideline on diabetic foot problems considers dermal or skin substitutes as an adjunct to standard care when treating diabetic foot ulcers only when healing has not progressed and on the advice of the multidisciplinary foot care service. The NICE recommendation does not specify which dermal, or skin substitutes are considered to be effective. (NICE, published 2015; Updated October 2019) Skin and Soft Tissue Substitutes Page 63 of 70 UnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical Policy Effective 09/01/202 3 \u00a91996 -2023, Oxford Health Plans, LLC International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) In 2020, the updated clinical guideline on the use of interventions to enhance the healing of chronic ulcers of the foot in diabetes, based upon their systemic review of the evidence. (Rayman et al ., 2020) The following IWGDF recommendations apply to the use of skin substitutes: The IWGDF recommends the consideration of placental- derived products as an adjunctive treatment to the best standard of care when standard care alone has failed to reduce the size of the wound. For use of topically applied treatments, the IWGDF recommends against the use of bioengineered skin products, among others, in preference to the best standard of care. For both of these recommendations, the IWGDF considered t he available evidence to be of low quality, and their recommendation was weak (i.e., based on the quality of evidence, balance between benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and cost or resource utilization).
