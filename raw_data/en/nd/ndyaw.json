of Children2-4 Years of AgeClinicians and immunizationprograms should avoid use of LAIVin children with asthma or a recentwheezing episodeConsult the medical record, whenavailable, to identify children 2through 4 years of age with asthmaor recurrent wheezing that mightindicate asthmaLive AttenuatedInfluenza VaccinationChildren 2-4 years of age-Parents or caregivers of children 2-4 years should be asked \"In the past 12 months, has ahealthcare provider ever told youthat your child had wheezing orasthma?\"6Live AttenuatedInfluenza Vaccination-Children whose parents orcaregivers answer
