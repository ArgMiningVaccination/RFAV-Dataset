The Chinese have long treasured qigong for its effectiveness both in healing and in preventing disease, and more recently they have used it in conjunction with modern medicine to cure cancer, immune system disorders, and other life-threatening conditions. Now in this fascinating, comprehensive volume, renowned qigong master and China scholar Kenneth S. Cohen explains how you too can integrate qigong into your life--and harness the healing power that will help your mind and body achieve the harmony of true health. Ken Cohen is a Qigong Grandmaster, health educator, and practitioner of North American indigenous medicine. Ken's teachers have included some of the most highly respected Masters and Grandmasters in the world, including William C.C. Chen (Yang Style Taiji Quan), B.P. Chan (Chen Style Taiji Quan, Bagua Zhang, Xing Yi Quan, Qigong), Madame Gao Fu (Chen Style Taiji Quan and Hunyuan Primordial Qigong), Share K. Lew (Taoist External Qi Healing), Sunyata (Vedanta in the lineage of Ramana Maharshi), Swami Venkatesananda (Sivananda Yoga), and others. Ken was certified from the William C.C. Chen School of T'ai Chi Ch'uan (1974), and was a student of Daoism. Ken was an apprentice to acupuncturist and Taoist Abbot, Dr. Huang Gengshi. In the late 1980s he was ordained as an interfaith minister with an advanced degree in pastoral counseling (Master of Spiritual Therapy M.S.Th.). He also holds an honorary M.A. in Psychology and other academic honors. For most of his life, Ken has lived at the edge of the Indian Peaks Wilderness in Colorado. In addition to Qigong, Ken has lifelong training in indigenous (Native American/ First Nations) healing and cultural ways and both teaches and practices these traditions. In 2003, Ken won the leading international award in energy medicine, the Alyce and Elmer Green Award for Innovation and Lifetime Achievement. Ken lives in Colorado with his wife, traditional Mexican Curandera (healer), Grace Alvarez Sesma. Kenneth S. Cohen's The Way of Qigong is a really great book on Qigong. Some say that the drawings are not adequate to understanding the moves they illustrate; however, we find that if you combine them with the descriptions, it is really quite clear. And this book has everything. Qigong movements and exercises, data about Qigong, research studies about Qigong, nearly everything you would want to know about the subject, even chapters on diet and tea drinking. Not that you won't want to keep learning, but this is a great place to start, thorough, comprehensive and fascinating. I pick this book up often because there is a wealth of information. I have read the book front to back several times, but I pick it up every couple months and just open to where it goes. I always pick up something new even though I read it before. This time I spent time in chapter 12 Active QiGong, Chapter 14 The energy of emotions and Chapter 19 Have a Cup of Tea. The Organ-emotion link was very interesting and the breathing exercises are great. The history and legend of tea and recommended prep for tea. This was a new discovery to me in a used book store. All that I knew before that was a vague reference to \"healing energies\" made in a martial arts book. Now there is another paradigm for me to asess vital information about my health. The balance of heat and moisture seemed to make a good barometer for changes in wellbeing, good or bad. I feel like I can finally do something about my own body's chemical composition that will improve my condition. These meditations, like the rest of the Taoist traditions, are beautiful to vizualize and a wonderful way to relax. Qigong, in the brief time I have practiced its gentle movements and standing meditations, has provided me with various unexpected benefits and a greater sense of calm. That being said, it's also somewhat difficult to find a non-teacher resource if one wanted to go deeper into the philosophy and workings of qigong. And wow lemme tell ya, he goes deeeeep. I have yet to practice everything in the book, because I have a job that I must go to sometimes, so I cannot vouch for the efficacy of everything in here. The vastness of the material included, however, makes this a must for those interested in working with qi. Excellent comprehensive book explaining the history and philosophy of qigong in great detail. Essential resource for anyone who is serious about studying this ancient Chinese art. First published in 1997, this book contains timeless wisdom that is just as relevant and practical today. Especially liked the qigong meditations. I've actually been reading this book a little at a time over the last two years and finally finished it. My first introduction to qigong was a YouTube video routine, and I noticed benefits pretty quickly. I started doing qigong every day a few years back, and incorporating more information from different sources. Eventually I started reading this book. I wish I had started with this in the first place! It is full of so much good information and the knowledge that the author provides has added a lot to my practice. I still do some of the flows I learned from my first qigong video that were not covered in this book, but bringing the skills and techniques learned here to those moves improves upon them. I have highlights all over this thing and I'm sure I'll continue to come back to it for reminders or going deeper into particular techniques. There are quite a few good reviews on this book, almost all of which I agree with. Ken Cohen was (when writing this book) and is still (in 2021) a true master of qi gong and allied arts. Even after 20+ years this book is still valuable. Similar to Steven Chang's The Great Tao, he shows how Qi Gong is more than just exercises or meditation but truly \"energy work\" as the term is often translated. This includes not only what you do for your own esoteric development but what you eat and drink and even how you approach sexual health. I will just add a couple of minor details. (1) Notes: even though Cohen is a authentic expert in the field, he still provides abundant footnotes and references throughout the text; there are more than 40 pages of them. (2) Bibliography. For the English speaking student of Qi Gong the 11 page bibliography alone is worth the price of admission and will provide you with a lifetime of reading. Yes, there are books and articles newer than those listed, but those listed are excellent and/or classic. With my academic background, this provided me with a lot of assurance that this wasn't just a quick new age production based half on folk wisdom and half on wishful thinking. This book is really good. I started qi gong about 2 months ago, following an oldish Chinese ( maybe) woman on Youtube, and It has been the best thing for my painful shoulder-arm pain. So, I wanted to know more, and found through a German blogger's page this book. This book has history, exercises, meditations, diet, and even sex advice. The instructions are clear with some pictures, and the best part of it all is the attitude of the writer. He is emphasizing that qi gong is to make your life better, more in harmony and wholesome, and not stress yourself with rigidity. For diagnosing anybody,though, I suggest to go an study the whole thing more, and for healing take a course in Reiki. This 1997 introduction to qigong is a blend of the history, philosophy, science, and practical applications of one of the oldest self-help systems in the world. I found it the perfect complement to the qigong lessons I've been taking. I wanted something that would give me a broad and foundational understanding of qigong, and this book fulfilled that requirement quite well for me. I have a better understanding now of why my teacher guides us to do certain things and it has helped me commit to continuing the practice going forward. Well-written, it's based on the author's own lifetime of qigong practice, healing, and teaching. There is a lot of good information in this book, and I appreciate that it empowers the individual in their own health care. However there were not infrequent overtones of Christianity that had me feeling vaguely uncomfortable and though he did often cite studies the author too often fell to anecdotal evidence for my liking. He also really goes out of his way to make sure you know that Zenmaster Alan Watts was his good friend. I don't know if there's a better book on this subject or not but I hope so because I can't unreservedly recommend this one. Out of the several books which I have read regarding Qigong, this is clearly the most comprehensive and most easily understood. Included is an extensive bibliography, audio-visual training suggestions, extensive notes on each chapter and a glossary of common Qigong terms. Perhaps the only weakness in this book that most Qigong Books share is that the practice material and illustrations that don't provide and optimal learning method compared to video and private instruction Qigong is an ancient Chinese practice for promoting health, longevity, and physical ability. The Way of Qigong gives a thorough overview of the subject, which discusses the nature of qi and Chinese medicine, the qigong routines, the history of Taoism, the scientific literature on qigong, diet, meditation, sexual activity and more. Anyone interested in learning about the Chinese paradigm of health and vitality would be advised to read this. What more could you ask for from a Qigong book? Prior to reading, I had extensive knowledge on chinese medicine and energy healing, but almost no knowledge on qigong itself. I had done 1 taichi class and that was the extent of my knowledge. This book is extremely informative and a great supplement to any student of chinese medicine or anyone simply looking to lead a healthier life. Its has everything you need practice qigong. I am eternally grateful to Ken Cohen for his knowledge and willingness to share in this awe inspiring book. Thank you for helping me along my path to wellness and understanding Qi. I will never be finished with this book. I refer to it almost daily in some way or another. It has brought me closer to reality and the idea of living peacefully on our planet with all of its inhabitants. T.M.I for beginners. E.g. there's a whole chapter on making tea. There are some instructions on doing Qigong. But let's be honest with ourselves, who's taking instructions from a book when you could watch a video - right? Jokes aside, there's no benefit to reading this book for beginners when there are more digestible ways to begin learning Qigong. The definitive reference for this ancient path/principle/discipline. It's dated, so has limitations for contemporary readers, but is a must-read for anyone interested in Eastern philosophy, thought, and practices. ....Was too exhaustive for me at this time, but I will circle back when I can. A marvelous adventure through the varied facets of Qi Gong practice. It includes some practices, but really, just get a teacher. The book functions best as a theoretical journey that goes well with an already developed practice. A readable account of the history of QiQong practice and the potential health benefits. Although there are some Qi Qong exercises described, the bulk of the book is more informative than instructional. The book is dense with lots of information, but I was looking for something to build background knowledge on the subject of Qi Gong. This book gave me more than I could digest, so after returning it to the library, I picked a book up for reference. I have absolutely no frame of reference for Qigong or it's related literature, but this felt like a comprehensive and helpful introduction to the subject. It covers everything from the historical roots and implicit philosophy of Qigong, as well as step by step instructions to certain exercises. Did not know how many forms of qigong there were, or that a qigong diet and sexual qigong existed, until I read this book. Qigong in its inner and outer forms apparently has many benefits, and it's gentle enough for anyone. "}
