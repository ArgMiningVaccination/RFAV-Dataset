The challenge: Shepherding the parents through what may be a very difficult conversation Should be respectful and cordial Should involve attention to, and empathy for, the parents' concerns ... but will also involve a need to be firm and consistent about what you can -and cannot -do for them with regard to a medical exemption Remember that ultimately you are acting as an advocate for the child's health and well -being ... and that your actions are bound by science and ethical considerations.Washington State Department of Health | 21Conversations with Parents ... Some requests for medical or religious exemptions will come from parents who have previously exempted their children from MMR vaccination on philosophical grounds. Other parents may recognize that their child has no medical grounds for exemption, but nonetheless refuse MMR vaccination anyway. These parents may be genuinely concerned about risk of harm , and are trying to do what they perceive to be in their child's best interests.Washington State Department of Health | 22Conversations with Parents ... The approach: Similar to all vaccine conversations If a parent requests an exemption from MMR vaccine, but has no valid medical contraindication ... Respectfully explain to the parent that there are no medical grounds on which you can exempt the child from the MMR vaccination requirement. If the parent remains particularly resistant to -or fearful of -MMR vaccination, acknowledge their concern (in particular if the underlying cause is a tragic personal experience). Be empathetic; remind parents that both you and they want what is best for their child. Washington State Department of Health | 23Conversations with Parents ... The approach: Similar to all vaccine conversations If a parent requests an exemption from MMR vaccine, but has no valid medical contraindication ... Remind parents that they are the ones in control of the situation, and may refuse MMR vaccination if they wish. However, let them know also that ethically you cannot attest to the need for a medical exemption for their child. Let them know also that failure to have their child vaccinated with MMR will put them out of compliance with state law. Washington State Department of Health | 24Conversations with Parents ... The approach to religious exemption requests ... As noted earlier -your job is to provide information and guidance, notto assess the validity of their religious claim. Again: be respectful and empathetic. Remember that the likelihood is very small that you will be able to dissuade a parent. Do not allow any personal feelings that you may have about such a claim to permanently damage your relationship with the parents -this will only diminish your ability to have any influence with them in the future.
