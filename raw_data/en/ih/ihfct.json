Featured Service Therapeutic Massage Our therapists seek to ease stress by focusing on tension-relieving techniques. A therapeutic blend of essential oils is utilized to remove lactic acid and eliminate deep chronic knots. Knead and release techniques are used to relax the muscles and increase circulation. Our therapists are happy to work with clients who are experiencing specific issues with pain and tension or those who are just looking for a relaxing experience. Services Mind Body Reflexology involves reflex points on the feet, hands, ears, and face that coincide to all organs, glands, muscles, bones, and the brain. Reflexology is not a massage. When a Reflexologist applies deliberate pressure to specific reflexes, nerve function, lymph, and blood flow are stimulated or sedated, thereby enhancing your body's natural healing abilities. Individual massage sessions are given in 60 or 90 minute sessions. Our massage therapists seek to ease stress by focusing on tension-relieving techniques.
