I have a health condition that requires a holistic approach and having the clinic so accessible to me has been a gamechanger and allowed me to improve over time. I can walk to their office from work, call or email about any of my labs and questions and receive a response very quickly. Mahalo nui! - 4/3/2023 Absolutely wonderful people! Drs Carolyn and Steve and Phoebe provide exceptional service and are a wealth of information. I truly appreciate the time and dedication that they all put in to making the path to health a learning and wonderful experience. Strongly recommend! - 7/30/2020 I went to the clinic for skin whitening and is very satisfied. After my sessions, I felt so good and healthy. The space is very clean and welcoming. Dr. Carolyn and Dr. Stephen are very professional and accommodating as well as Ms. Judy and Ms. Trudy who are both very consistent with their exceptional service. All of them are truly remarkable. My experience with them was very pleasant which I truly enjoyed. I would highly recommend their service to anyone. - 12/30/2021 Didn't even get to speak to a doctor yet, but the lady who answers the calls is rude AF. Why even bother. - 6/27/2021 After finding several other doctors unhelpful, I made an appointment with Hawaii Natural Medicine after finding them online. Their on-boarding process was all online which made the paperwork and communication prior to my first appointment a breeze. In my appointment, Dr. Candido was very helpful and understanding and made a lot of great suggestions to be healthy through diet and other natural options and without lifetime medication. She was very perceptive and answered many of my questions before I could even ask them (and I typically have a LOT of questions so this was very impressive). While I only had one appointment with them, I would highly recommend them as I have had very few interactions with other doctors that listened and were as supportive and constructive as Dr. Candido and her team at Hawaii Natural Medicine! - 10/18/2021 It is sad this company has so many great reviews but I can't even get in to experience it for myself. Their process to qualify you as a patient is poor. My mom is currently seeing Dr. Carolyn Candido and she said they are great. So I give them a call. I told them over the phone I have not seen a doctor in 15 years. I am a healthy adult and need to find a PCP so that I can get referred to a cardiologist. The protocol for anybody is to first see your doctor then they have to refer you. I know this already and that is why I decided to call a doctor so they can do that. I called last Friday, and their office staff pretty much said we don't see anybody with chest pain. I was shocked. She was already trying to cancel me from being a patient. I had to pursue the conversation more just to get her to ask the Doctor to verify what she said was true. I get a call today, Monday, and the answer was the same. We will not see you as a patient all because I said I need to figure out what is going on. It could be a pulled muscle for all I know! I KNOW she won't be able to tell me what it is and she would have to refer me. But she did not even want to see me at all just to get a baseline of my health condition to see if I truly qualify to be a patient. I ask the staff, wouldn't I need a PCP so I can be referred? She said, correct. So you don't want to be my PCP to refer me? Correct. Then she tries to belittle me by saying, \"It is common sense that you have a different specialist for different conditions...\" In my head, I am like DUH! I need you to refer me to a specialist!!!! OMG! It is different if she said, sir, we don't refer anybody to specialists; that is not what we do. Then I would understand and respect that protocol. But that is not the case. If they had a better process, I am sure I would have been more than qualified to be a patient at their practice. They did not even ask me anything or even seem concerned. No referrals, nothing. A \"Sir I am sorry but you can call .... they can help you with what you are looking for.\" She just wanted to get off the phone quickly because she realized how unprofessional and silly she sounded refusing to see a patient. I don't drink, I don't smoke, we have a healthy diet and I am not even old. We take a holistic natural medicine approach to almost everything. It is sad that this company did not care enough to sit down with me and find out my needs find the baseline of my health and then decide if I am a good fit. But she said, \"I don't want you to waste our time or yours.\" Do you mean, really waste your time? If this is their service and I have not even made it in the door, I am wondering how they got so many \"great reviews.\" I own a marking company and help companies like yours in customer service, getting online leads, and helping them grow their business. I can tell you this was not the best image you want for your company in trying to provide wellness solutions for potential patients. There are 11 in my household and you could have gained 10 more patience. I am sure you guys are nice people and I am sure you helped so many; just revamp your \"filtering process\" because it SUCKS! I am going to use this experience as a case study to my clients on how NOT to handle a lead or potential customer. Clients spend anywhere from $20-$350 for a lead. I don't know how much your leads cost but I am pretty sure throwing away money is not what you guys do. I am not saying, don't use this company. I am giving you my experience so you can be the judge on if you want them to handle your healthcare needs when this is how sloppy their filtering process looks. God bless and good luck. - 4/21/2020 Great staff , clean office, great views , punctual appointment times with free ample parking located downtown by the Honda dealership! Dr Stephen is very knowledgeable , detailed and his staff is wonderful -- I highly recommend coming to them for all your natural medicine needs! - 8/28/2018 I'm long overdue in writing this review, as I've been going to see Dr. Benchouk for nearly 2 months now. Knowledgeable and caring, he has helped me lose 20 pounds. Special diet, combined with the Vitamin B12 and HGC injections have been key. He's very supportive and offers suggestions to help you with whatever ails you. He offers other services, besides weight management, such as various IV therapies, supplements, vitamins and alternative health treatments. Highly recommend seeing Dr. B for any of your issues, especially if other treatments have failed you. - 8/23/2021 As a visitor to Hawaii, my friend (who is a resident here) and I were looking for a place to go on a rainy day. Wow did we luck out!!! From the front desk to our therapists (Rowena and Isaiah) we could not have asked for a better place. We have gotten hundreds of massages in our lives and can EASILY say this one was the best. It was so relaxing and hit all the right places. We each upgraded to the \"King\" package and it was so worth it. We cannot recommend this place enough!!!! - 8/13/2020 So I made an appt. got there, filled out forms with the female doctor, she got all my info, informed me of what the procedure will be, lotion and pallets won't be covered by insurance, then she asked what insurance I have, which I have triple coverage with HMSA and Tricare, then she informs me that the consultation was $250.00 but she'll give a discount because their office staff failed to inform me that they don't except the insurance that I have, so my visit and for her to tell me what possibly might help me cost me $190.00 for the dayvery disappointed, I felt taken advantage of when I went there for help, my daughter said they just took advantage of you, how sad all about money, so much for reaching out to feel better.
