Very soon, perhaps al ready, a key energy and material resource will reach a hi storic transition. This point, known as \"peak oil,\" will usher in a new age - of declinin g capacity to supply society wi th an energy source unmatched in energy density, net energy return, scale, and ease of use. Peak production has occurred befo re in fields, regions and nati ons - the United States offering the most famous example - but now we stand poised to peak globally. Because oil is a finite, nonrenewable resource, a worldwide decline in production is inevitable. Peak oil will necessitate many changes in society. It is diffic ult to imagine how we can continue a transportationintensive culture without this key re source. Similarly, most of industrial agriculture relies on fossil fuel inputs. Indeed, oil is a feedstock of a truly massive array of products. And economic growth, entailing ever greater throughput of materials and increasing consumption, has depended on expanding energy availability. The consequences of oil production decline are therefore seriou s. It may be difficult to fully grasp and acknowledge the implications. Can the future be so different than today? Ten years ago, few would have predicted the collapse of a paramount blue chip institution such as General Motors. And few astut e political commentators would have predicted the election of an African American President of the United States. The collapse of the former Soviet Union and the rise of global communications via the inte rnet are also testaments to rapid change in a very short time. The changes implied by peak oil are immense, and thus will requ ire preparation and planning commensurate with t he size of the problem. The transition to a postpeak oi l world will likely entail the shortening of commercial and trade supply lines and the reloca lization of essential communit y needs, such as food production. Products that requi re little oil in their composition and manufacturing will be favored. We will have to develop and employ new technologies t hat are both environmentally benign and based on renewable resources and energy. There will also be a need for skills that have been neglected in the age of cheap energy, and knowledge thought to be outdated and obsolete. Prosperity may take on new meaning - from a simple metric of accumulated money to a broader meaning of community w ell being, security, and commonwealth. On the most basic level, peak oi l, climate change, and a host o f other environmental crises require that we recognize and live within the limits of our biosphere. This is the challenge and opportunity that we have bef ore us today. We hope that thi s report contributes to a prosperous and resilient future.

We rely on c heap oil for everyday necessities such as transportation, food, clothing, and electricity. However, oil is a non renewable resource. It is widely acknowledged that the world h as reached, or will soon reach, the point at which oil pr oduction is at its maximum, or peak. Once the world reaches peak oil production, we will not run out of oil but we will run short of oil. At that point, the price of oil will rise and become more volatile. Given the sys temic nature of oil, a decline in the availability of cheap oil wi ll have implications for all as pects of society. The Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force was charged with assessing Bloomington's vulnerability to a decline in ch eap oil and developing research ed and prudent strategies to protect our community. Since March 2008, the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force has met biweekly to discuss ways in which our community might be made more resilient in the face of peak oil. Specifically, the Task Force examined the following community systems: municipal services, transportation, land use, housing, sustenan ce, and the economic context. The Task Force envisions a post peak Bloomington wherein most r esidents live within walking distance of daily needs; most of the food required to feed residents is grown within Monroe County; residents can eas ily and conveniently get where they need to go on bike, foot or public transit; most of the community's housing stock i s retrofit for energy efficiency; and local government provides highquality services to its residents while using less fossil fuel energy. While peak oil presents our community with serious challenges, it also presents us with an opportunity to make a great community even better. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force ivThe following is a representative, but not exhaustive, review o f vulnerabilities and strategies identified by the Task Force: Economic Context. Bloomington and Monroe County are clearly part of both national and global economies and our relianc e on a steady supply of inexpen sive goods from as far away as halfway around the world makes us vulnerable to a decl ine in inexpensive oil. Mitigation : Promote economic relocalizatio n through \"Buy Local!\" initiatives; encourage a Local Exchange Trading System and cooperate with Transition Bloomington . Examine sector dependence on oil. Develop and deploy sustainable forms of energy. Develop and promote green jobs. Municipal Services. As the price of oil both becomes more volatile and more expensi ve, so too will the price of electricity, natural gas, and other energy resources. It will become more expensive for the City to: treat and pump drinking water; treat its wastewater; provide fuel for law enforcement and fire protection; heat and cool municipal buildings; and pick up trash and recycling. Similarly, the City will also experience a general increase in cost of just about anything that relies on energy to produce an d transport it. Mitigation : Explore hybrid energy (hydroelectricsolar) generation to com plement existing power at the water treatment plant. Encourage more rainwater captu re by residents and the City. Offer energy efficiency and water conservation incentives to residents. Expand water storage capacity. Transition all backup generato rs to renewable sources of ene rgy. Develop a community compost program. Establish waste reduction goals Zero Waste Bloomington by 2040. Explore sludgetobiogas energy generation at the wastewater treatment plant. Develop a fuel allocation plan wherein, in the event of a fuel shortage, the Police and Fire Departments are given greatest priority. Replace patrol cars wi th electric vehicles. Investigate police pursuit vehicles that do not rely on fossil fuels and transition over to such vehicles as this technology improves. Explore alternatives to asphalt. Offer carpooling incentives to employees. Reduce the size of the City fl eet though partnerships with ca r sharing groups. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force vTransportation. Of all sectors, transportation is the most petroleum dependent and the most vulnerable to a disruption resulting from declining world petroleum supplies. Ninety seven percent of transportation energy is reliant on fossil fue l. In Monroe County, we drive approximately 2.8 million miles per day. That's like driving one car around the Earth at the equator 112 times in one day. Mitigation : Bring daily necessities closer to where people live. Establish ride and car sharing programs. Increase connectivity & the nu mber of planned \"lengthy corridors\" for bicyclists. Make bus transportation faster and more attractive. Seek funding improvements for Bloomington Transit. Encourage Bloomington Transit t o transition its bus fleet from one relying on diesel fuel to one relying on locallyproduced biogas. Work toward a regional Compreh ensive Land Use and Transportat ion Plan involving the City of Bloomingt on, Monroe County, and Indiana University that fosters bicycle, pedestrian, an d transitfriendly changes in l and use. Encourage commuter rail betwee n Bloomington and other cities. Encourage bus service between Bloomington and downtown Indian apolis. Land Use. When it comes to land use, the physical separation of where w e live from where we carry out the activitie s of everyday life - work, food, school, health care, and community - is by far the biggest threat posed by the end of ch eap oil. Mitigation : Through zoning and other land management tools, encourage the redistribution of land to bring about denser living arrangements, and a closer i ntegration of residential and commercial activity, thus reducing the total a mount of intracity transportation required. We must restructure our community to provide high density, multiuse arrangements friendly to transit, bicycles, and pedestrians. Update the City's land use documents with an eye to peak oil. Target public transit routes t o help shape neighborhood devel opment . Housing. An aging grid, paired with the likelihood that more and more people will turn to electricity to power their cars, means that the grid will be in creasingly taxed. In Indiana, the grid is powered by coalgenerated energy. Coal relies on o il for extraction and transportation. Absent efficiency improvements, it will be ever more expensive to heat our homes. Mitigation : Engage in outreach to reduce e nergy demand through conservati on. Work to retrofit 5% of homes for energy efficiency per year. Explore the possibility of loca l power generation from renewa ble sources. Establish loans and incentives for installation of renewable energy. Create incentives to make rental units more energy efficient. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force viSustenance can be understood as the maintenance and nurturance of health a nd life. The elements of sustenance include: food, water, waste handling, an d health care. At present, these elements are provided by p rivate companies, government, a nd publiclyowned corporations and are entirely dependent on petroleum. Indeed, less than 2 percent of the food consumed by city residents is produced within the city, it s surrounding region or the state. Mitigation : Work closely with the private sector and Indiana University to outline a detailed plan for community food security. Adopt a Food Security Resolution . Plant edible landscapes on public property. Organize Cityled horticultural services to include the colle ction, processing, and distribution of organic waste. Increase local food storage. Train and deploy more urban farmers. Remove or reduce legal, institutional, and cultural barriers to farming within and around the city, and open institutional markets to local f ood. Establish foodbusiness incubator programs with access to com munity kitchens. Dedicate public land to intensive gardening and farming. Work toward a yearround regional farmers' market. Work toward the establishment of a local land trust for the b anking of farmland. Work toward providing more local or regional organic food to Monroe County Community School Corporation, In diana University, Ivy Tech, an d Bloomington H o s p i t a l . Create a local, publiclycontrolled seedbank. Encourage water conservation through outreach and incentives. Create community composting sites. While the City has little dire ct influence over health care, it can work with stakeholders to advocate for a health care system that is resilient even in the face of peak oil. Specifically, as a community we should: encourage a mobile medical corps for house calls; encourag e more neighborhood health clinics and doctors' offices; and support a concentra tion of essential medical services to remain in the central city location accessibl e by public transit and pedestr ians. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 1INTRODUCTION Oil is everywhere. The food we eat, the clothes we wear, the tools and materials we use to build and repair our homes, all rely on petroleum inputs. Most medical products and the delivery of medical care rely on oil. Of course, oil has afford ed us an unmatched mobility as found in the personal automobile. Cars have given birth to vas t road networks that have reshaped human settlement patter ns. The billions of plastic pro ducts available today are made from oil. Oil is even a maj or component of some nonobvio us products like denture adhesives, basketballs, and lip balm. In short, oil is systemic - a key, if often invisible, component of our e veryday lives. Cheap oil has allowed us to achieve great economic benefit, enabling us to enjoy inexpensive food, travel, and manufactured products. Indeed, w hile the US comprises five percent of the world's populatio n, it consumes 25 percent of th e world's oil. Ninetyfive percent of our transportation infrastructure relies on petroleu m. However, oil is also finite. Mos t of the oil the world now cons umes consists of biological material deposited at the bottom of ancient shallow seas between 90 million and 150 million years ago. While nature can and eventually will produc e more oil, it will do so only very slowly and on a time scale that must be measured in \"geologic\" terms - tens of millions of years. Therefore, for all practical human purposes, once a barrel of oil is consumed, it will never be replaced. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 2WHAT IS \"PEAK OIL\"? Given the finite nature of oil, the fundamental problem is that there must inevitably come a point in time when world oil production reaches some absolute m aximum and then goes into decline. Attributed to petr oleum geologist M. King Hubber t, the term \"peak oil\" does not refer to the time when we \"r un out\" of oil. Instead, the p roblem is that we will run out of cheap oil. Long before the oil runs out, the difficulty and cost of ext raction will have risen so far that it will no longer be possible to increase the rate of production. Instead of increasing, production will star t to fall. That point - the point at which the growth rate in global oil production turns into a decline rate - is the point of \"peak oil.\" When we reach that point, we will not have \"ru n out\" of oil, but we will have \"run short.\" In order to grasp the point that \"running short\" is not the same as \"running out,\" it is necessary to understand that the \"sipping soda through a straw\" model of oil production is incorrect. That model assumes th at it would be possible to suc k up the world's oil at a uniform high rate until suddenly, one day, the oil is all gone, just as it would be possible to sip up all the soda in a glass at a uniformly high rate until t he bottom of the glass is reached. The extraction of natural resour ces such as oil does not proceed in this way. In reality, what happens is that the oil which is high quality, easy to find and readily processed is used first. The oil that is inferior, harder to fi nd and/or more difficult to extract is produced later. The result is something of a bellshaped curve, in which production rises over time to a peak and then transitions into decline. During the decline phase, oil production continues to fall as the remaining source s become more and more difficult to extract. M. King Hu bbert projected that world oil production would peak around 2000, but continue at everdeclin ing rates for another 200 years thereafter. Hubbert's projection turns out to have been off by a few years - world oi l production did not actually peak quite as early as 2000 - but he was remarkably close. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 3 The \"Hubbert Curve.\" Decades ago, Hubbert predicted oil production would peak in 2000. It turns out Hubbert was not exactly right, but pretty close. Source: Wikimedia Commons When this Task Force began its work in March 2008, there was a sense that the peak might still be a few years away. However, it is now clear that peak may have arrived while we went about our work. It is likel y that the world will never aga in produce or be able to produce as much oil in a single year as it did in 2008. Production reached a plateau in 2005 and barely budged above that the plateau through 2008, despite a record oil price of $147 a barrel recorded in July. That month, the price of a gallon of unleaded gasoline rose to over $4.00 a gallon in Bloomington and as high as $5.00 a gallon in other parts of the county. Subsequently, as we all know, the market price of oil - and the price of unleaded - plummeted. This was not be cause of an increase in production , but because of a huge drop in demand. In fact, oil production is down significantly. The Organiza tion of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in particular has reduced its output in an attempt to set a bottom limit to the price. In th e meantime, exploration for ne w oil fields and much development of previouslyidenti fied but hitherto unexploited f ields has been put on hold. As the economy begins to recover from its worst nosedive since the Great Depression, Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 4demand for oil will once again r amp up, but it will be difficul t to achieve the production level of 2008, much less to move beyond it. Further evidence that peak oil has been either reached or is ve ry near is that we are now discovering less and less new oil. Indeed, the rate of producti on has been outrunning the rate of new discovery by an evergrowing margin for almost a qu arter of a century: Source: www.aspoireland.org However, it's not just the Bloom ington Peak Oil Task Force who thinks we've reached peak. Many experts agree. Rec ently, analysts at the financial service s company Raymond James announced that: NonOPEC oil production apparently peaked in the first quarter of 2007, and given precipitous falls in oil output from Russia to Mexico, there's not much hope of a recovery. OPEC production - and thus global output - peaked a little later, in the f i r s t q u a r t e r o f 2 0 0 8 ... . T h e c o n t e n t i o n r e s t s o n a s i m p l e a r g u m ent: OPEC oil production actually fell even as oil prices were above $100 a b arrel, a sign of the 'tyranny of geology' that limits the easy production of ever mo re crude. Those declines had to have come for involuntary reasons such as the i nherent geological limits of oil fields.... We believe that the oil market has alrea dy crossed over to the downward sloping side of Hubbert's Peak.1 1 Keith Johnson, \"Peak Oil: Global Production's Peaked, Analyst Says ,\" Wall Street Journal Blog, May 4, 2009. http://blogs.wsj.com/environme ntalcapital/2009/05/04/peakoilg lobaloilproductionspeakedanalystsays . Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 5 Other observers believe that peak oil might not be here just ye t, but is right around the corner. The president of the internatio nal Association for the Study o f Peak Oil and Gas, Prof. Kjell Aleklett of the University of Uppsala in Sweden, stated that \"oil production will probably p eak between 2011 and 2012.... Perh aps if demand grows more moderately than expected, the peak might be d elayed until 2018 or so.\"2 Speaking at his association's 2009 annual convention, Eric Streitberg, chairman of the Australian Petro leum Production and Exploration Association, stated that \"peak oil is just three years away.\"3 Charlie Maxwell, energy expert from Barron's magazine, believes that, because of the current recession , peak oil has been postponed by a couple of years, from 2013 to 2015.4 2 Tom Nicholls, \"The Peak is Nigh h April 2008, 40, http://www.fysast.uu.se/ges/files/April%202008%20Issue%20%20Th e%20peak%20is%20nigh.pdf . 3 Andrew Collins and Andrew Curtin, \"Peak Oil, ETS and Jobs on th e Agenda at APPEA 09 Oil and Gas Conference,\" February 6, 2009, http://www.abc.net.au/rural/resource/stories/s2587478.htm 4 When recently asked what had su rprised him most about the \"oil roller coaster we'v e been on,\" Maxwell replied: I would have to say that what st r u c k m e m o s t , a s a s u r p r i s e , i s t h e v i r u l e n c e i n t h e downtrend in the world economy. That's a negative for the peak oil story, but only a temporary negative. By crushing demand, we are in effect gaining two more years, maybe three, in which we in the consuming world have added to our tim e before the peak, and could take good advantage of, since the peak is right upon us - I have it still at 2015 for all liquids.... A lot of people had said that the year 2015 is too f ar out for the peak. But I built a big margin in there because I thought we might have two recessi ons. I didn't dream that we would have one really big one. So I've got 2015 out there. Bu t if you said to me last July, when do you really believe the peak is going to come, I would h ave said 2013. I started years earlier by estimating 2015 and I happily held to that view as I saw the recession begin to develop because I could see that we would probably push it off a little bit. For your purposes, I've got 2008 for the peak of nonOPEC - not really a peak, it's a plateau, but we're falling off it now. And then 2011 for the peak of the top 50 l isted companies, the ones that dominate the stock market, so the stock market investors will s ay the oil industry has peaked because their stocks have peaked. And then I've got 201 2 for the peak of black crude oil and the 2015 for the allliquids peak, which I take to be ultimate peak oil. And that would include gastoliquids, coaltoliquids, NGL's [natural gas liquids]. And it would include both synthetic and natural crudes. Steve Andrews, \"Interview with Charlie Maxwell (Part 1 of 2),\" The Energy Bulletin, June 22, 2009 ( http://www.energybulletin.net/node/49303 ). Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 6The phenomenon of peak oil is even recognized by the U.S. government. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports that energy markets will become more volatile, making supply disruptions more likely. The GAO advises that \"[t]he co nsequences of a peak and permanent decline in oil production could be even more prolonge d and severe than those of past oil supply shocks.\"5 A U.S. Department of Energysponsored study, widely known as the \"Hirsch Report,\" makes it clear that peak oil presents the world with an unprecedented risk management problem: Waiting until world oil producti on peaks before taking crash pr ogram action would leave the world with a significant liquid fuel deficit for more than two decades. Initiating a mitigation crash program 10 years before world oil peaking helps considerably but still leaves a liquid fuels shor tfall roughly a decade after the time that oil would have peaked. Initiating a mitigation crash program 20 years before peaking appears to offer the poss ibility of avoiding a world liquid fuels sh ortfall for the forecast period . The obvious conclusion ... is that with adequate, timely mitigation, the economic costs to the world can be minimized. If mitigation were to be too l i t t l e , t o o l a t e , w o r l d s u p p l y / d e m a n d b a l a n c e w i l l b e a c h i e v e d through massive demand destruction (shortages), which would translate t o significant economic hardship. There will be no quick fixes.... Effective mitigation means taking decisive action well before the problem is obvious. 6 When the Hirsch Report was written in 2005, the authors were reluctant to state precisely when oil production might peak, as the range of estimates was s till too broad. They cited a number of authorities who disagreed about the probable date of peaking, putting it anywhere from as early as 2006 to as late as 2025 or later. By June 2008, however, lead author Robert Hirsch had conclud ed that \"Today the situation is worse [than it was in 2005] and the reason for this is that it is now obvious that wo rld oil production is already on a plateau. It has reached a high level, and has leveled off. The point at which oil production will decline is probably not far away. If the world [had] started to implement 5 US General Accounting Office, Crude Oil: Uncertainty about Future Oil Supply Make it Important to Develop a Strategy for Addressing a Peak and Decline in Oil Production , GAO07283, February 2007. 6 Hirsch, R. L., Bezdek, R., Wendling, R. Peaking of World Oil Production: Impacts, Mitigation & Risk Management. U.S. Department of Energy. National Energy Technology Laboratory. February 2005 (hereinafter, the \"Hirsch Report\"). Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 7 solutions 20 years before the pea k oil problem, we would have s tood a very good chance of beating the problem and could have avoided significant negative consequences for our economy. As it turns out, we now don't have 20 years; we don't even have 10.\" 7 The Task Force endorses this view. After close examination, th e Task Force agrees that the date of peak will turn out to be somewhere between 2008 and 2015 - most likely 2008. It is clear that peak oil is either here or right around the corne r. Now is the time to collectively implement measures t o reduce our reliance on petro leum. RATE OF OIL DEPLETION So what happens after production peaks? Production obviously de clines thereafter. The rate of decline is widely estimated to be about 3 percent per y ear.9 The Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas estimates that by 2030, production could be down to 5060 million barrels per day from a possible high of 9094 million b arrels per day.10 The rate at which the world has been burning through oil is sobering. Although oil production began as far back as 1859, by 2005: 97% of all the oil that had ever been produced worldwide had b een produced since 1940. 88% of the oil that had ever been produced had been produced s ince 1960. 57% of all the oil that had eve r been produced had been produc ed since 1980. 37% of all the oil that had eve r been produced had been produc ed since 1990.11 7 Allianz, Energy Future: A Significant Period of Discomfort, Interview with Robert Hirsch, June 2008. http://knowledge.allianz.com/en/gl obalissues/safety_security/en ergy_security/hirsch_peak_oil_production.html 9 The Oil Depletion Protocol, http://www.oildeple tionprotocol.org/ . Please see Appendix I for a discussion of factors that affect global decline rate. 10 Nicholls, loc. cit. 11 Richard Gilbert and Anthony Perl, Transport Revolutions: Moving People and Freight Without Oil (London, Earthscan, 2008), 120. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 8Given the enormous rate at which the world has been burning its way through oil in the past few decades, two things are highly probable: Geological constraints alone are enough to prevent continued pr oduction at the current nearpeak rates much beyond 2015. Despite continuing significant d eclines as time goes on, produc tion rates will remain sufficiently high that most of the remaining oil in the world w ill be consumed over the course of the next few decades. If the downslope of the glo bal oil production curve resembles the upslope, 90% of the world's remaining recoverable oil will be gone within 50 years of the peak - in other words, within rough ly 50 years of the present. What's more, the U.S. currently i mports approximately twothird s of its oil. Our ability to do so depends on the continued w illingness and ability of a rel atively small number of oil producing nations with surpluses to continue to export. Howeve r, production within many of those countries will probably be going into decline within o ne or two decades. It's time to change the way we d o business. It's time to rethink our individual and community habits to radically r educe our reliance on oil. STRATEGIES THAT WILL NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM As the discourse on \"peak oil\" i ntensifies, so too do possible \"solutions.\" Many solutions pivot on the idea that we will be able to continue \"business as usual\" without any effort to conserve or become more efficien t. For reasons explained below , the Task Force considers some of the most popular proposals - drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, mining oil shale and biofuels - as intrinsically limited and flawed. Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) The ban on offshore drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) has reentered public discussion and some advoca te for opening up this ecologi callyfragile area for drilling. However, even if a substantial amount of oil is found in this area, it will take many years to bring it into production. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 9 What's more, it is highly unlikely that ANWR could produce anyw here near the amount of oil necessary to meet current U.S. demand. According to a U.S. Geological Survey estimate, the amount of technicallyrecover able oil in ANWR is somewhere between 5.7 and 16 billion barrels.12 Those sound like huge numbers , but they pale in comparison to consumption rates. The U.S. has been using oil at the rate of approximately 7 billion barrels per year. Therefore, if ANWR actually does contain as much as 16 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil, the U.S. would go through every drop of it in a little over two years if it had to rely on that source alone.13 By the time ANWR oil came into production, it is likely that world production will already be in steep decline. The additional production from ANWR would not be sufficient to increase world petroleum output. It would simply reduce the rate of decline slightly for a few years until ANWR, too, becomes depleted. 12 The probability that it is at least 5.7 billion barrels is 95% . The probability that it could be as high as 16 billion barrels is only 5%. The mean estimate is 10.4 billion barrels. 13 U.S. Geological Survey, Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, 1002 Area, Petroleum Assessment, 1998, Including Economic Analysis (Fact Sheet 002801: Online Report), http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs002801/fs002801.htm It is interesting to note that the purpose of the first oil well in Pennsylvania was to find a replacement for whale oil for indoor lighting. Whale oil burned with a clean, bright flame, but by 1846, the U.S. whaling fleet had reached \"peak whales\" and was going to the ends of the earth in search of its prey. Above is a cartoon from Vanity Fair, published in 1861 showing happy whales celebrating the discovery of oil wells in Penns ylvania. Source: Vanit y Fair, April 20, 1861 , 186. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 10In 1980, I asked an economist who was an expert on the cost of producing oil shales, what the world price of oil would need to be in order to make oil shale commercial. He turned the question arou nd by replying that oil shale would always cost at least $10 per barrel over the world price of oil.... So forget about oil shale. - Robert A. Hefner , The GET , 2009Oil Shale Production of oil from shale has also been proposed as a soluti on. \"Oil shale\" is neither oil nor shale. It is a rock containi ng kerogen, a waxy substance that might best be described as a precursor to oil. Like petroleum, it consists of organic mat ter laid down millions years ago. Unlike petroleum, the source rock was never buried deep e nough (7,500 to 15,000 feet) to be subject to the intense heat needed to \"cook\" the ke rogen into petroleum. To turn the kerogen into oil, humans must do what nature has not - appl y substantial amounts of heat to do the cooking. This mak es the conversion of kerogen i nto oil an energyintensive and costly process. Thus, while i t always seems as though the production of oil from oil shale might become profitable if only the price of oil would rise a few more dollars a barrel, when the price of oil does go up , the rising cost of energy its elf continues to make the production of oil from shale economically unfeasible. This phenomenon has been dubbed the \"Law of Receding Horizons.\" According to a 2007 U.S. General Accounting Office report, \"The Green River Basin is believed to have the potential to produce 3 million to 5 million barrels per day for hundreds of years. However, it is possible that 10 years from now, the oil shale resource could b e producing 0.5 million to 1.0 million barrels per day.\" 14 That would be 2.6% to 5% of U.S. consumption at current rates. Such a rate of production ten years from now would not result in an increase in U.S. oil production, but rather would simply reduce the rate of decl ine. However, unless the \"Law of Receding Horizons\" is so mehow repealed, no oil will be produced in commercial quantities from U.S. oil shale, ever. 14 GAO, Crude Oil: Uncertainty about Future Oil Supply Makes It Important to Develop a Strategy for Addressing a Peak and Decline in Oil Production , February 2007 ( http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d07283.pdf ), 55. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 11Biofuels Some believe that it will be possi ble to make up for the declin e in oil production by resorting to the large scale production of biofuels - petroleum substitutes made from plants. The story of biofuel production in the U.S. has been, up to this point, largely the story of cornbased ethanol. By 2005, the U.S. consumed 3.9 bil lion gallons of ethanol (compared to 136.9 billion gallons of gasoline). 15 By 2008, ethanol production was predicted to reach some 9 billion gallons. This growth in prod uction was achieved in large part due to lavish federal subsi dies, which in 2007 amounted to 76% of all federal subsidy money going to renewable energy.16 The utility of corn ethanol production has been widely questioned because of doubts about how much it produces in the way of additional energy. According to David Pimentel of Cornell University, \"To produce a liter of 99.5% ethanol uses 43% more fossil energy than the energy produced as ethanol .\"17 If that statement is even remotely accurate, then the U.S. corn ethanol program must be viewed as a farm subsidy program, not an alternative energy program. Production of ethanol from sugar cane, a major industry in Braz il (where production is also subsidized and where half of the cane crop is devoted to ethano l production), seems to have more potential. According to one estimate, the amount of e nergy produced is about 9 times the amount of fossil fuel energy input. 18 However, Pimentel and Tad Patzek place the energy return on Brazilian c ane sugar much lower, at 2.28:1 rather than 9:1; for U.S. cane sugar, they estimate the rate of return at 1.48:1.19 15 Energy Information Administration, Biofuels in the U.S. Transportation Sector, February 2007 with errata as of October 15, 2007, http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/ analysispaper/biomass.html . 16 Jeff St. John, Corn Ethanol's Subsidy Glut, January 9, 2009, http://www.greentechmedia.com/arti cles/read/cornethanolssubsi dyglut5489/ 17 David Pimentel, \"Renewable and Solar Energy Technologies: Energy and Environmental Issues,\" in Biofuels, Solar and Wind as Renewable Energy Systems: Benefits and Risks, David Pimentel, ed.

Patzek, \"Ethanol Production: Energy and Economic Issues Related to U.S. and Brazilian Sugarcane,\" in Pimentel, ed., Biofuels, Solar and Wind, 361. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 12One of the major problems associated with the production of eth anol from corn is that it drives up the price of corn and the price of food for consumers . In fact, the ethanol subsidy program, in combination with heavy spring rains and flooding in the Midwest, was blamed for a 119% increase in the pri ce of corn between 2007 and 2008.20 Furthermore, because industrial agriculture relies so heavily upon petroleum inputs, we are likely to experience lower grain productivity post peak. Because diverting food crops to fuel production seems like a risky or questionable strategy, some hopes are placed on \"cellulosic\" ethanol - fuel produced f rom crop residues or grassland biomass. However, Patzek warns that the removal of any substantial amount of biomass from the land for use as biofuel feedstock is unsustain able - it would rapidly wear out the soils because the biomass would no longer replenish the nutrients. NOT JUST PEAK OIL: PEAK ENERGY Oil is not the only hydrocarbon fuel whose production peak will pose difficulties. Coal and natural gas will also peak in the near future, likely within a couple of decades. As more and more people switch to electricity to power their cars and heat their homes, the peaking of both coal and natural gas will al so affect the way we go about our individual and collective lives. In Indiana, most of our e lectricity is ge nerated by coa lburning power plants. The Task Force took a very close look at coal and projects that wor ld coal production might peak around 2030, and that world natural gas might also peak at about the same time. Both of these issues are discussed in detail in Appendices II and III. 20 David Goldman, Food Price Spike: Is Ethanol to Blame?

Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 13THE BLOOMINGTON PEAK OIL TASK FORCE The Bloomington City Council and Mayor acknowledged peak oil in 2006 with the passage of Resolution 06 \u00ad07: Recognizing the Peak of World Oil Production . In late 2007, the City strengthened its commitment to m itigate the effects of peak by establishing the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force. As spelled out in Resolution 07\u00ad16: Establishing a Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force, the charge of the group wa s to assess the community's vulnerability to changing energy markets and to develop researc hed and prudent mitigation strategies. The Resolution called for the Task Force to document its findings in a report for approval by the Mayor and City Council. Beginning in March 2008, the sev en members of the Task Force met biweekly to work through vulnerabilities and possi ble solutions. Early on, the Task Force decided to parse its work into the following subject s: The Economic Context, Munici pal Services, Land Use, Transportation, Housing, and Sus tenance. Each Task Force membe r assumed responsibility for a particular subjectmatter area. The Task F orce approached each of these subject areas with a threepronged analysis. First, the group collected background data. Second, it assessed the community's vulnerability to a d ecline in cheap oil in each of these subject areas. Lastly, it worked to develop prudent miti gation strategies. The Task Force has aimed to make its work as transparent as possible. Members of the Bloomington community frequently attended our meetings. For th ose unable to attend, Task Force meetings were broadcast via our local Cable Access T elevision Service since August 2008. Members of the Task Force have also given several public talks. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 14GUIDING PRINCIPLES In drafting recommendations for this Report, the Task Force was guided by the following principles: SUSTAINABILITY . Recommendations should be sustainable. That is, they should foster environmental integrity, equity, and economic he alth. They should also be more than mere shortterm fixes. Recommendatio ns should work indefinitely, or at le ast for a very long time. ACTIONABILITY . Recommendations should be actionable. Toward this end, the Task Force has organized it s goals and strategies into tho se which should be implemented and/or realized in the short term and those which are long term goals. Most often, the Task Force's recommendations call for the City and other community stakeholders to start to explore change im mediately, understanding that it may take years to fully implement a reco mmendation. A FOCUS ON CONSERVATION . While the Task Force's recommendations call for greater efficiencies and, occasionally, new energy source s, most of the recommendations focus on reduci ng oil consumption. The Task Force maintains that a lot of the oil we use is wasted. We do not ne ed to use all the oil we do to have happy, prosperous, and fulfilling lives. To the extent that much of our current oil consumption is frivolous, initial step s at conservation should be immediately actionable. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 15ENDORSEMENT OF THE OIL DEPLETION PROTOCOL & CALL FOR 5% REDUCTION IN OIL CONSUMPTION Many other communities have eithe r adopted oil reduction or oil independence goals. Toward this end, many have endorsed the Oil Depletion Protocol, a proposed international agreement under which nations wo uld reduce their oil consumptio n at rates at which known oil reserves are being depleted - approximately 3 percent.21 The intent of the Protocol is to reduce competition among nations for scare resources and to help communities prepare for oil price shocks and shortages. Notably , the Bloomington Common Council supported the adop tion of a global oil depletion protocol in 2006 with Resolution 06\u00ad07: Recognizing the Peak of World Oil Production. However, to prepare for peak in a robust way, the Task Force ca lls for a reduction in consumption that not just keeps pace with depletion, but exceeds it. The Task Force recommends that the community sta rt now to reduce its reliance on petroleum, by reducing petroleum consumption by 5 percent per year . This would realize a 50 percent decrease in oil consumption in just 14 years. While it may sou nd like an ambitious goal, by cooperating and rethinking the way we do things, this is an achievable goal. Not only will reducing petroleum consumption make the community healthier and more sustainable, it will save us all money. 21 See Oil Depletion Protocol. supra note 9. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 16VISION The recommendations herein are intended to envision a resilient and prosperous community while we collectively descend the peak of energy production. In so doing, the Task Force uses terms that might be new to some, and uses other terms in ways that are a little different from conventiona l understandings. We define t hese key terms as follows: ENERGY DESCENT : The irreversible decline of net energy available and the accompanying transition from a h igh to a low fossil fuel use community. 22 RESILIENCE : The ability of an ecosystem - from an individual to a whole community - to maintain its integrity and abili ty to function in the face of change and shocks from the outside. Resilient systems can roll with external changes and a dapt as needed. PROSPERITY : Our ability to flourish as individuals and as a community under energy constraints and within ecological limits of the planet. \"Prosperity is about things going well for us - in accordance with ( proin the Latin) our hopes and expectations (speres )... But prosperity is not synonymous with income or wealth.\" 23 This Report is intended to be a guiding doc ument; it is advisory in nature . The Task Force makes no claim that our recommendations provide all the answers; indeed, we hope and expect that the community will ha ve numerous innovative ideas t o add. However, we do think that the ideas we propos e here provide a good start. Certainly, preparing for peak oi l presents our community with u nprecedented challenges. However, it also presents us with unprecedented opportunity. Wh ile the recommendations that follow are primarily aimed at \"powering down\" our energy c onsumption, they also promise nonenergy benefits such as reduced environmental impac ts, greater savings for residents, improved quality of l ife and greater interaction amo ng community members. Indeed, while individual preparation for peak oil is certainly important, the greatest way to prepare for peak is to work together toward a community solutio n. Peak oil presents us with an opportunity to make a great community even better. 22 \"What Exactly IS Energy Descent?\" Transition Culture, http://transitionculture.org/2006/05/02/whatexactlyis energydescent/ . 23 Tim Jackson, Prosperity Without Growth?

Some recommendations are relatively si mple and can be implemented in the near term; others are considerably more complex and call upon the City to explore the issue further in the interest of realizing a longterm goal. Many of the suggestion s call for action by City departments and require the expe rtise of City staff. A team of City staff should be charged with addressing the Task Force's proposals. The team might wish to delegate some ideas to City entities whose missions align, in part, with those of the Task Force, such as the City of Bloomington Commission on Sustainability (BCOS), the City's new Sustainability Director, the Environmental Commission, an d Team Process. We leave it up to the best judgment of the City Administration (with f eedback from the City Council) h ow to build such a team. AN EXAMINATION OF COMMUNITY SYSTEMS Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 18THE ECONOMIC CONTEXT The enormous expansion of the human population and the economies of the United States and many other nations in the past 100 years have been accomplished by, and allowed by, a commensurate expansion in the use of fossil (old) fuels, meaning coal, oil, and natural gas. To many energy analysts the expansion of cheap fuel energy has been the principal enabler of economic expansion, far more important than business acumen, economic policy, or ideology. - Charles A.S. Hall, Robert Po wers and William Schoenberg 24 As this Report is being written, the most seri ous global recession since Worl d War II has been under way for over a year. While the severity and duratio n of the recession may include factors that are not directly connected to the peak oil phenomenon, some observers attribute the economic crisis to the rapid escalation of oil pr ices over the last decade - an escalation that reached an unpre cedented high in the summer of 2008. As is commonly understood, the current crisis was largely triggered by the collapse of the subprime mortgage market. However, what is less understood is the link between oil and the housing market. It is very possible that the trend of everincreasing energy costs from 20042008 caused the housing bubble to burst. 24 Charles A.S. Hall et al.,\"Peak O il, EROI, Investments and the Economy in an Uncertain Future,\" in Pimentel, ed., Biofuels, Solar and Wind as Renewable Energy Systems: Benefits and Risks, David Pimentel, ed. (New York: Springer, 2008), 110. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 19Indeed, this runup occasioned energy prices to occupy a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) not seen since 1985: Source: Charles A.S. Hall, \"Economic Implications of Changing EROI Ratios,\" presentation to the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas, Barcelona, Spain, October 2008. This thesis is explored most thoroughly by economist Jeff Rubin . Rubin asserts that oil price increases were behind four of the last five global recess ions, including the present one. He writes: From January 2004 to January 2006, the rise in oil prices from $35 to $68 per barrel drove energy inflation, as measured in the US consumer price index, from less than 1 p e r c e n t m e a s u r e d y e a r o v e r t o y e a r t o a s h i g h a s 3 5 p e r c e n t . T ogether with an associated increase in food prices ... soaring energy costs drove the overall consumer price inflation rate from below 2 percent to almost 6 percent d uring the summer of 2008, reaching its highest mark since the 1991 oil shock. You don't have to be a Nobel Prizewinning economist to figure out what happened to interest rates over that period. As soaring oil prices stoked inf lation's flame, the federal fun ds rate began a relentless climb from a record low of 1 percent to over 5 percent by 2007. And rates stayed by and large at that level for anot her year until the economy rolled over into recession. But just as interest rates were starting to catch up with inflation , a mountain of subprime mortgages came due for refinancing. Not only was the interest free teaser period about to end, but the interest rates that subprime mortgage holders w ould now have to start paying are almost double the rates when they first got the mortgages. The rest is history. 25 25 Jeff Rubin, Why Your World is About to Get a Whole Lot Smaller: Oil and the End of Globalization (New York: Random House, 2009), 190. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 20 Inflation and Volatility It will be difficult to predict the effect of peak oil on prices. As Rubin suggests, the natural effect of petroleum shortages would be to cause inflation. The primary cause of inflation in such an environment would be an increase in the price of oil. And, as discussed in the Transportation chapter, a significant increase in the cost of fuel will stress the budgets of households reliant on personal vehicles and wi ll have an especially regressive effect on the communi ty's lowest wage earners. Simil arly, the cost of products will likely rise for at least two reasons. First, many product s (plastics, aspirin and clothing, to name a few) are reliant on oi l as a key input. Second, as B loomington imports most of the products it consumes, as the cost of transporting goods to the community increases, so too will product prices escalate. A period of inflation, accompanied by slow or negative economic growth, would represent a return to the socalled \"stagflation\" of the 1970s and early 19 80s. There were two major periods of inflation during this time. The first, during 1973 74, arose from the \"first oil shock\" caused by the OPEC oil em bargo that resulted from the 19 73 ArabIsraeli War. It saw the rate of inflation increase from an annual rate of 3.63 percent in January 1973 to a high of 11.80 percent in January 1975. Inflation declined some what thereafter, falling to a low of 4.86 percent in Decembe r 1976 before beginning to rise a gain. It shot up in a major way following the \"second oil shock\" resulting from political e vents in Iran in 197879. In November 1978, Iranian oil workers reduced output from 6 millio n barrels per day to 1.5 barrels per day. The inflation rate in the United States rose from 8.89 percent in November 1978 to 14.76 percent in March 1980. It remained as hi gh as 10.14 percent in October 1981. Meanwhile, GDP actu ally declined in 1973 and 197 4, and again in 1982. Source: Clayton Guiltner, blog entry, Apr. 22, 2008 Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 21However, inflation is just one part of the picture. As prices increase, demand decreases, triggering lower prices. Lower prices tend to encourage greate r demand. Wild oscillations in demand could result in wild oscillations in gas prices. The fallout of the summer of 2008 is testament to this volatili ty: On July 11, 2008, the price of oil hit $147.29/barrel. Faced with record prices at the gasoline pump, motorists rapidly began to alter their behavior, cutting back on discretionary driving or resorting to public transportation. New gas guzzlers sat forlornly on auto dealers ' lots. Further figuring into demand des truction was the mortgage crisi s that hit just a few weeks after the record oil price peak, triggering a global economic m eltdown. Oil took a nosedive down to about $33/barrel in December 2008. Indeed, oil demand dropped by nearly 1.5 million barrels a day since July 2008.26 Six months after the Dece mber low, oil was once again inching its way above $70/barrel. In the teeth of the worst postwar recession on record, this doubling of oil prices in only six months is truly remarkable. The increasing likelihood of evermore volatile oil prices is widely recognize d. The United States Government Accounting Office (GAO) reports that energy markets will become increasingly volatile, making supply disruptions more likely.27 26 Jad Mouawad, \"One Year After Oi l's Price Peak: Volatility,\" New York Times, July 10, Inc. http://greeninc.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/10/oneyearafteroilspricepeak volatility/?scp=1&sq=one%20year% 20after%20oil's%20price%20peak& st=cse 27 \"Crude Oil: Uncertainty about Future Oil Supply Makes It Impo rtant to Develop a Strategy for Addressing the Peak and Decline of Oil Prod uction,\" GAO07283, February 2 007, http://www.gao.gov/n ew.items/d07283.pdf Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 22 Daily changes in the spot price of crude oil, 19832009. Source: International Monetary Fund, Bloomberg as cited in the New York Times, July 10, 2009.28 Some observers might see the rapi d fall of oil prices in the la tter half of 2008 as proof that the theory of peak oil has been falsified, but we believe they are wrong. It is hard to know how long the current recession will last. However, if the rece ssion begins to lift soon, oil consumption will once again begin to accelerate. Then rising d emand could collide with falling production, triggering an other rapid runup in oil pric es and possibly bringing about another recession soon after the c urrent one ends. However, if the recession is prolonged (for, say, another five or even ten years), then oil production could fall below even that required to meet depressed demand. In that case, rising oil pr ices could prolong the recession still further. At that point, if not before, the worl d will probably begin to sit up and take notice that the Age of Oil is coming to its inevitable end. By the end of the present century, if not before, most of the energy that is now being pr oduced to fuel our vehicles and charge our electrical grid w ill have to come from renewable resources. 28 Ibid. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 23VULNERABILITIES 1. Systemic reliance. As pointed out in the Introduction , crude oil is the lifeblood of our culture and society. From transportation to food to ub iquitous plastic products, eve rything hinges on oil. Thanks to this dependency, few of us have control over basic necessities of life. As a community, we are very vulnerable to a decline in cheap oil. 2. New competitors for energy resources. When the United States was on th e upward slope of Hubbert's Cur ve, there were many populous countries in the world that consumed relatively little petroleum per capita. Now some of those countries - particu larly China and India - are de veloping and motorizing rapidly. As a result, on the dow nward slope of the curve, Amer icans will have formidable new competitors for the world's remaining supplies of petroleum and other fossil fuels. 3. Financial chaos. The current financial crisis will continue to make it difficult to mobilize the resources necessary either to maintain the current level of oil production or to continue the migration to a postpetroleum economy. The development of new oil fields, which are often in challenging environments and therefore very costly, has been sl owed or postponed. The development of major renewable e nergy projects has likewise been delayed or postponed. 4. A finite Earth cannot support infinite growth. This is a point that seems simple enough to grasp, but it tends to get lost in our well intended efforts to produce and consume more. This point is als o one long championed by ecological economists, specifically Herman Daly. Daly struggle d to communicate the idea of ecological constraint to the World Bank, where he worked in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 24Daly writes: That was when I realized that economists have not grasped a sim ple fact that to scientists is obvious: the size of the Earth as a whole is fixed. Neither th e surface nor the mass of the planet is growing or shrinking. The same is true for energy bu dgets: the amount absorbed by the Earth is equal to the amount it radiates. The overall size of the system - the amount of water, land, air, minerals an d other resources present on th e planet we live on - is fixed. The most important change on earth in recent times has been the enormous growth of the economy, which has taken over an ever greater share of the planet's resources. In my lifetime, world population has tripled, while the numbers of li vestock, cars, houses and refrigerators have increased by vastly more. In fact, our econ omy is now reaching the point where it is outstripping Earth's ability to sustain it. Resources are running out and waste sinks are becoming full. The remaining natural world can no longer support the existing economy, much less one that continues to expand. 29 Clearly, the energy budget of th e Earth is fixed. For more than 200 years we have been increasingly able to exceed that budget by drawing down nonren ewable fossil fuel resources created by ancient sunlight tens or hundreds of milli ons of years ago. However, this sort of consumption cannot go on for another 200 years. Since 1929, U.S. GDP has grown by 3.4 percent per year. 30 Even if we replace petroleum reliance with renewable energy, it would be a considerable challenge to sustain an economy the size of the one we h ave now. Assuming that GDP inc reases by 3 percent per year, the nature of exponential growth suggests that by the yea r 2100 the economy would be 14 times as large as the one we have now . And if 3 percent annual grow th required the consumption of 2 percent more primary energy per year to achiev e, then by 2100 our economy would require almost 6 times as much energy as it does now. It is highly unlikely that such a scenario is achievable. What if a 2 percent growth rate in energy consumption is extend ed out to a period of a thousand years? In that case, annual energy consumption would have to be at a level 398,264,652 times as high as it wa s a thousand years earlier. This is an obvious absurdity, 29 Herman Daly, Special Report: Economics Blind Spot is a Disaster for the Planet, 15 Oct. 2008, http://www.newscientist.com/art icle/mg20026786.300specialreporteconomicsblindspotisadisaster fortheplanet.html?page=2 30 Bureau of Economic Analysis, Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts: 1929 Through First Quarter 2009 (July 2009). Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 25and it is clear that it simply will not be possible to supply e nough energy to increase energy consumption by a factor of almost four hundred million using on ly the resources available on and to a finite planet. The argument is not fundamentally changed even if we assume tha t we manage to increase the energy efficiency of the eco nomy so that we cut the amount of additional energy required per unit of GDP growth in half. Suppose that, in orde r to support annual GDP growth of 3 percent, primary energy consumption only needed to increase 1 percent instead of 2 percent. In that case, we would need to consume 1.1 times as much energy per year in ten years as we do today, 2.7 times as much in a hundre d years, and 20,959 times in a thousand years. While 20,95 9 is a lot less than 398,264,652, it is almost as absurd to imagine that we could increase our consumption (and production) of energy by a factor of 20,959 in a thousand years as it is to imagine that we could in crease it by a factor of 398,264,652. In recent decades, economic growth and energy con sumption have been relatively \"decoupled,\" which means that t he amount of additional energy required per unit of growth has decreased. However , in order for economic growth to continue in perpetuity, it would have to be the case that growth and energy consumption can be absolutely decoupled. This seems wildly implausible. Better, Not Bigger The economic problems caused by peaking oil, coal, and natural gas production will eventually begin to call into question, in a much more obvious way than previously, conventional notions of \"growth. \" It is commonly assumed that a n increase in the production and consumption of g oods is associated with a higher quality of life. Peak energy will call into the idea that quality of life and economic health are necessarily tied to more. A \"growth economy\" is typica lly characterized by an increa sing GDP. However, a growing GDP does not necessarily imply a comparable improvement in quality of life, as it does not account for income distribution, social factors such a s health, and ecological factors - not least of which is energy scarcity. It is possible to have a \"prosperous\" economy which is not based on perpetually rising production and consumption. In other words, Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 26instead of the old notion that \" bigger is better,\" peak will re quire us to focus more closely on \"better, not bigger.\"31 To be sure, the City of Bloomingt on has already taken forwardt hinking steps to foster thoughtful economic vitality. The City's Department of Economic and Sustainable Development states that, \"[l]oca l government must take the lead in envisioning and creating a thriving community, identified by the health of its environment, the vitality of its economy and the equity among its citizens.\"32 In a postpeak community, it mak es sense to work toward a stead ystate economy. Importantly, steady state does not mean stagnation or plateau; instead it means that the amount of resource throughput and waste disposal remain relativ ely constant. The key features of such an economy are: (1) sustainable scale, in whic h economic activities fit within the capacity provided by ecosystems; (2) fair distribution of wealth; and (3) efficient allocation of resources. 33 Toward this end, we echo the resolution of the Bloomington Environmental Commission: A sustainable economy (that is, an economy with a relatively stable, mildly fluctuating product of population and per capita consumption) i s a viable alternative to a growing economy and has become a more appropri ate goal for the U.S. and other large, wealthy economies. A longrun su stainable e c o n o m y r e q u i r e s i t s e s t a b l i s h m e n t a t a s i z e s m a l l e n o u g h t o a v oid the breaching of ecological and economic capacity (especially durin g supply shocks such as droughts and energy shortages), to promote the efficient use of energy, materials and water, and enable an accelerated shift toward the use of renewable energy resources. 34 31 To borrow from Eben Fodor who borrowed from Edward Abbey.

Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 27From Global Problems to Homegrown Solutions The Bloomington economy is clearl y woven into the fabric of bot h the national and global economies. The food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the tool s we use to fix our homes and tend our gardens are almost exclusively imported from distant states, sometimes even distant countries. Ge tting these basic goods to our community exacts a heavy transportation cost. While a pr otracted examination of the l ocal Bloomington/Monroe County economy is beyond the scope of this Report, as the price of oil continues to become more volatile, we can anticipate the emergence of certain local economic threats. On the other hand, our community's posit ion as a collegedriven metro area will likely buffer some of the economic effects of peak oil. Traditiona lly, Monroe Coun ty has had one of the lowest unemployment rates in Indiana. I n part, this is due to the presence of Indiana University. Higher Production and Distribution Costs Most local businesses rely on sh ipping in products for retail s ale or raw materials for product manufacturing. As the co st of fuel becomes more expens ive, these businesses will be hard hit. Bloomington busines ses that buy or sell in nation al and global markets will have to contend with higher shipping costs. They may have to adopt new business strategies or may have to lay o ff employees to compensate for h igher costs. Less Discretionary Income If households have to spend more on energy, they will have less to spend on discretionary goods and services. Businesses such as restaurants and enterta inment venues which rely on the discretionary spending of local residents or outoftown visitors will be squeezed. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 28 Fuel Rationing As we collectively slide down the peak oil curve, motor fuels w ill become more scarce. As a result, fuel will be rationed. R ationing will either be imposed by the market in the form of higher prices that drive out mar ginal consumers, or by the government by fiat. A combination of both forms of rationing is plausible. Despite the inconvenience, gasoline and diesel fuel rationing could have the benefit of permitting the allocation of fuel to priority users such as emergency first responders, urban transit systems, farmers, and truckers in adequate quantities or at below market prices, so that they could continue to operate despite budgetary constraints. At the same time, however, rationing would m ean that others who still have the money to pay for fuel would not necessarily be able to buy as much as they want, when ever they want, and might have to curtail their consumptio n. While local government does not have any jurisdiction over rationing, we should anticipate that rationing may happen. Gasoline rationing was considered during the Second Oil Shock of 1978\u00ad1979. Ration coupons were printed, but never issued. Source: Wikimedia Commons Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 29Population growth and shifting demographics The population of Bloomington mig ht grow or change as a result of peak oil. As is discussed in the Transportation chapter, Monroe County is a net importer of workers - almost 19 percent of the workforce comes to Monroe County from surrounding counties to work. These commuters might move to Bl oomington in order to avoid or reduce the cost of daily commuting. On the flip side, peo ple who currently live in Bloo mington but work elsewhere (about 7 percent) might move away for the same reason. Economic hardship could cause an increase in enrollment at Indiana University if residents lose their jobs and elect to return to school. On the other ha nd, hardship might instead mean declining enrollments at IU if parents and students are unable to afford tuition. If enrollment declines, the number of students living in the city might decline, resulting in a change in the mix of temporary t o permanent residents in the city. Businesses catering particularly to the student population could be adversely affec ted. Changes in population size and m ix could have unanticipated effects on housing demand. Housing demand might be reduced if economic adversity causes a reduction in the number of individual households, as people formerly living apart (such as adult children living apart from their parents) move i n together in an attempt to sav e money. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 30MITIGATION GOALS & STRATEGIES Following are some general steps we can collectively take to mi tigate the economic effects of peak oil while fostering a healthy and prosperous postpeak local economy. All of these steps are classified as \"shortterm\" simply becaus e we need to take these steps very soon to mitigate the effects of peak oil. However, once i nstituted, the presumption is that these initiatives will only become stronger in the long te rm. SHORT\u00ad TERM STRATEGIES (1\u00ad5 years) 1. Promote economic relocalization. Rising petroleum prices will resu lt in increasing costs for imp orting goods into the community from outside and for e xporting goods from the communi ty elsewhere. We should start to work now toward relocalization. Relocalization aims to build communities based on the local production of food, energy, and goods. That Bloomington must and will undergo a significant relocaliza tion at some point is assumed i n other sections of this Report, particularly the chapter on Sustenance . Because of this tend ency, we think that Bloomington businesses which are able to replace distant suppli ers with local and regional suppliers, and distant markets wit h local and regional markets, might ultimately tend to do better than businesses that are unable to manage such a transit ion.35 As globalization is an energyintensive system of excha nge and production, it is extre mely vulnerable to high energy costs and shortages. Econ omic relocalization should be considered necessary for community economic security. 35 It should be noted, however, tha t extreme price volatility migh t hamper efforts at relocalization as individuals or businesses encouraged to produce for the Bloomin gton market because of high transportation costs could suddenly find themsel ves priced out of that market very quickly if transportation costs plummet. Moreover, if government rationing or fuel allocation policies are introduced that give priority to freight transportation the cost of importing goods into Bloomington fro m elsewhere could remain low much longer than if no such priority exists. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 31 Economic incentives. The City should leverage economi c development incentives, such as a Business Incentive Loan Fund and tax abatements to further encourage the relocalization of goods and services, especially those essential to daily life.36 Foster a \"buy local\" campaign. Local government can help foster and expedite relocalization by actively promoting local businesses. The City of Bloomington has taken great strid es to foster local purchasing by partnering with lo cal stakeholders to launch a co mmunitywide I Buy Bloomington publicity campaign to be launched in the fall 2009. Such effor ts to publicize the economic and pragm atic benefits of local purchasi ng are essential. We hope that such outreach strength ens existing local businesses and encourages new ones to form. Encourage a Local Exchange Trading System (LETS). In thinking through ways to encourage more people to buy locall y, the Task Force examined the possibility of reinstituting a local currency. Local currency complements U.S.issued money but is a medium of exchange that could only be spent in Bloomington. This migh t tend to encourage local produ ction. Local currencies have been used in oth er communities with mixed success. A previous attempt to introduce a local currency (BloomingHOURS) was unsuccessful. BloomingHOURS was introduced in August 1999; however, within a year the currency had gone out of circulation. Merchants were left with a stockpile of currency that they could spend ne ither inside nor outside of th e community. For a local currency to be successful i n Bloomington, it would be imp ortant for government and other large insti tutions to back the system. Fo r example, if the Utilities Department and Bloomington Transit accepted local cur rency, such support would substantially help strength en such an alternative system. As local currencies tend to have mixed results, it would be pru dent for the community to explore the idea of a Local Exchange Trading Syste m (LETS) as a complement to conventional U.S. currency. LETS systems are loc al, nonprofit exchange networks in which goods and services can be traded wit hout the need for printed currency. LETS networks use interestfree local credit so direct swaps do not need to be made. For instanc e, a member may earn credit by doing childcare or computer work for one person and spend it later on carpentry wi th another person in the same network. This helps a wide cross section of the co mmunity - individuals, small businesses, local services and nonprofits - exchange local goods and services.37 36 See, City of Bloomington's Business Incentives , http://bloomington.in.gov/sections/viewSection.php?section_id=4 18. 37 See further, LETS Program: A Sustainable Local Economy , Relocalize.net http://www.relocalize.net/node/2194 . However, a similar problem can occur with a LETS system as t hat which contributed to the demise of BloomingHOURS some people may accumulate a lot of credits but have no way to spend them. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 32 Local government should collaborate with Transition Bloomington Relocalization promises resilien ce and is gaining increasing momentum thanks to the growing \"Transition Movement.\" This movement seeks to equi p communities for the twin challenges of climate change and peak oil. It aims to prepare cities and towns for a shift from oil dependence to local resilience.38 Central to the Transition Movement is the idea that life without oil could be happier and more rewarding than a current oildependent society. 39 Indeed, a recent New York Times article on the Transition Movement exclai med, \"The End is Near! (Yay!)\"40 while a popularizer of the Transition Movement, Rob Hopkins, has written that transition meets the threat of peak oil with a spirit of \"elation, rather than the g uilt, anger and horror\" behind most environmental activism. \"Change is inevitable, but this change could be fantastic.\" 41 The key tenet of the Transition Movement is that communities, especially in western, industrialized countries, lack \"resilience,\" defined a s the ability to respond with adaptability to disturbance . The Transition Movement is p redicated on four key assumptions: 1) That life with dramatically lower energy consumption is inevitable, and that it's better to plan for it th an to be taken by surprise; 2) That our settlements and communi ties presently lack the resilie nce to enable them to weather the severe energy shocks that will accompany p eak oil; 3) That we have to act collectively , and we have to act now; and 4) That by unleashing the collective genius of those around us to creatively and proactively design our energy descent, we can build ways of living that are more connected, more enriching and recognize the biological limits of our p l a n e t .42 A local Transition group has recently formed in our own communi ty - Transition Bloomington .43 The local government should partner with Transition Bloomington to work toward a cooperative postcarbon future. 38 Rob Hopkins, The Transition Handbook: From Oil Dependency to Local Resilience (Totnes, Devon: Green Books Ltd., 2008), 54. 39 Rob Hopkins and Lipman, P., Who We Are and What We Do, version 1.0 ( 01 February 2009). 40 Jon Mooallem, The End is Near! (Yay!), New York Times, April 19, 2009, http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/ 41 Ibid. 42 Ibid., 172 43 http://transitionus.ning.com/g roup/transitionbloomington Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 33 2. Examine sector dependency on oil. Leaders from the Bloomington Econ omic Development Corporation, The City of Bloomington's Economic and Sustain able Development Office and t he Greater Bloomington Chamber of Commerce met with mem bers of the Bloomington Peak Oi l Task Force to discuss the relationship between peak oil and the local economy . It is clear that leaders are committed to improving the quality of life for Bloomington residents. However, it is also clear that these leading economi c development entities have not looked specifically at the local economic vulnerabilities posed by peak oil. As the speci fic economic effects of peak are both difficult to predict and beyond the scope of this Report, we recommend that local economic development entities engage in an analysis of the exte nt to which our community's biggest employers are dependent on petroleum for th eir business. As is discussed in the Sustenance chapter, we know that the health care industry is intimately tied to oil. What about IU? What of the other industries the c ommunity aims to strengthen: biotechnology, technology, life sciences, and the arts? Local g overnment and its community partners should work to identify the ways in which peak oil will affect: Production and distribution cost; Consumer demand; Suppliers of raw materials and semiprocessed goods; and Embodied energy required for products and services. 3. Prepare the tourism industry for peak oil. Bloomington has positioned itself as a premiere cultural, arts, entertainment, and recreational destination for resident s and visitors. In an environment where fuel is costly, it is likely that tourist destinations close to home could become more popular, and Bloomington's tourism industry could benefit from a relocalization of travel. There are three major po pulation centers (Indianapolis , Louisville, and Evansville) near Bloomington. Having bus or rail transportation links to t hose centers would further enhance the position of Bloomington as a tourist destination. Having improved local Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 34 transit and pedestrian and biking facilities would help also. However, the possibility also exists that in an oilshort worl d, people will be reluctant or unable to travel even to nearby tourist attractions. 4. Commit to a steady state economy. A steady state economy is one in which the level of production and consumption remains relatively constant. It is one i n which the goal of having mor e stuff is replaced by the goal of having an improved quality of life. The notion of a steady state economy is likely to be resisted b y many people. However, a debate over whether such an econ omy is \"good\" or \"bad\" would be pointless. We do not take the position that a steady state economy is preferable to a growth economy. Rather, we take the position that a grow th economy will soon simply no longer be possible. Considering the two remaining alternatives - a steady state eco nomy, or an economy in a continual state of crisis and co llapse - the steady state is cl early preferable. 5. Develop and deploy alternative forms of energy. With global peak energy perhaps as little as a couple of decade s away, the world and the nation will need to take immediate steps to manage it. Because peak energy will occur as a result of production constrain ts of various nonrenewable sources of energy, attempting to solve the problem of peak energy by substituting some fo rms of nonrenewable energy (e.g. natural gas) for others (e .g. petroleum) is a temporary b ut not a permanent solution. Whil e a detailed examination of possible forms of alternative ene rgy is beyond the scope of thi s Report, local government should work with public, private entities, and other stakeholders to encourage and provide incentives for sustainable forms of energy.44 44 The City's zoning law , The Unified Develop ment Ordinance, cont ains incentives for developers to integrate alternative energy into their projects. However, to date, thes e incentives are seldom engaged. Source: www.globalwarming.house.gov Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 356. Vigorously promote green jobs. As one of its key economic development strategies, the City of Bloomington has expressed its intent to position Bloomingt on as a \"green capital of the M idwest.\"45 While it is difficult to predict exactly what the post peak employment environment wi ll look like, we can anticipate that we will experien ce a \"greening\" of employment as the economy becomes less dependent on fossil fuels and more dependent on renewable energy. Local government should partner with t he public and private sectors t o aggressively promote and provide incentives for business startups and existing empl oyers in sectors facilitating the transition from nonrenewabl e to renewable energy. It is a t least equally important to promote those facilitating reduc tions in energy demand through conservation. The change in the employment pro file presented by peak oil repr esents both challenges and opportunities. Unfortunately, it is somewhat difficult to predict what the eventual employment mix might be, and eve n more difficult to predict the timing of any shift from one job mix to another. As previously noted, economic difficul ties facing consumers could cause the supply of jobs in restaurants, entertainment, persona l services, and \"luxury\" retail to shrink. This would be particularly probl ematic for the many Indiana Uni versity students who use such jobs to he lp pay their way through colleg e. Thus, it is more than conceivable that a postpeak econ omy could make it more financi ally difficult for students to attend Indiana University. A substantial decline in enrollm ents would adversely affect the city's largest employer. Additionally, for employees in lowpaying jobs, the costs of commuting a long distance may come to outweigh the economic benefits of employment. Thus, some jobs could go unfille d even as unemployment rises. In general, jobs in fields that a re petroleumintensive will be in jeopardy. For example, the demand for longhaul truck drivers could fall as more of the na tion's freight shifts from the roads to the more energyefficie nt railroads. As jet fuel beco mes increasingly expensive, more airlines could be driven ou t of business, resulting in mass employee layoffs. 45 City of Bloomington, Indiana, Strategic Plan 2009\u00ad2010, 8. See, http://bloomington.in.gov/strategicplan Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 36On the other hand, there is prob ably considerable potential for new employment in \"green jobs,\" especially those related to the manufacture, installatio n, and maintenance of solar electric and solar thermal systems. According to the BlueGreen Allian ce and the Natural Resources Defense Council, in a post peak environment, Indiana will ne ed the following types of skil led workers: Carpenters to make buildings more energy efficient; Electricians for expanding mass transit solutions; Operations managers to manufacture energyefficient automobiles; Machinists to craft essential components of wind power; and Welders for solar power manufacturing.46 To this list, we would add home a nd business energy efficiency specialists, appliance repair specialists, and farmers and agricultural workers. In the long run, should fuel shortages cause a breakdown in mechanized agriculture, a significant amount of additional labor could be required for food production. Greencollar jobs require some new skills and some new thinking about old skills. The economic development community, in cooperation with local emplo yers, Workforce Development, and local education al institutions, should identif y specific skills called for to meet the demands of our economy during the period of energy des cent, and should develop educational and training program s to teach those skills. Some of green jobs will be entirely local because they are in the service sector; while solar panel s can be manufactured in China, we can't ship our houses to China to have the panels installed there. Green manufacturing jobs will have to compete in a marketplace that will remain theoretically global, but the rising cost of t ransportation may give local pr oducers a competitive advantage that they currently la ck. Green jobs must provide workers a living wage, and we must work toward creating a gree ncollar environment that provides for a mix of entry and professionallevel work. 46 Job Opportunities in a Green Economy: Indiana Can Gain from Fighting Global Warming , http://www.nrdc.org/globalWarming/jobs/indiana.pdf ; See also, Pollin and WicksLim, Job Opportunities for the Green Economy: State\u00ad by\u00adState Picture of Occupations that Gain from Green Investment , http://www.bluegreenalliance.org/admin/publications/files/0005. 4.pdf . Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 37MUNICIPAL SERVICES Identifying and mitigating community vulnerabilities is probably one of the more important - if often unwritten - expectations we have of our local governments. 47 - Daniel Lerch, Post Carbon Cities Three challenges are converging to shape the way City Hall carries out its business of protecting the health, safety, a nd welfare of the people of Bloomington: weaning the community from its dependence on oil, climate change, and the r esultant uncertainties of both.48 These challenges present us with an unprecedented moment when it comes to the way the City carries out it duties. But it also provides us wi th opportunity. Peak oil requires that the City take a systemic look at its oil dependencies and match each dependency with greater conservation, greater efficiency, and r enewable energy sources. To be sure, the City has already implemented some very forwardingthinking steps to reduce our reliance on petroleum: The Mayor recently announced his Sustainable City Initiative whose mission is to \"to promote economic vitality wh ile improving the human conditi on and preserving the community character of our Ci ty. It operates on the princip le that Bloomington can achieve environmental health, economic prosperity and socia l justice through sustainable development;\"49 in 2005, the City shifted to a biodieselonly diesel purchasing policy; in 2007, the City engaged in an energy audit of City Hall, the result of which was a series of HVAC upgrades resultin g in monthly reductions in energy consumption by 1015% and yielding a 32% savin gs - or $45,634.66 - within its first year; the City has establish ed an internal team to examine vehicle ac quisition, energy consumption and purchasing policies; the Office of the Mayor and the City of Bloomington Commission on Sustainability continue to actively promote the Change a Light, Change the World program, which encourages citizens to replace i ncandescent light bulbs with co mpact fluorescents (CFLs). The City has partnered with the local grocery cooperati ve Bloomingfoods to distribute over 40,000 bulbs, with a total estimated savings of $2.0 million over the life of these bulbs; 47 Lerch, Daniel. Post Carbon Cities: Planning for Energy and Climate Uncertainty. A Guidebook on Peak Oil and Global Warming for Local Governments (Sebastopol: Post Carbon Press 2007), 4. 48 Ibid. at v. 49 http://bloomington.in.gov/sustainablecity Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 38 all City traffic signals have be en retrofitted with lightemitting diode (LED) technology; the City recently passed a Green Building Ordinance calling for all occupiable City structures to be brought up to LEED Silver standards, provided they meet a payback test; Lowflow, sensored faucets and f ixtures have been installed at most occupied City facilities; The City has reduced its mowing frequency from once every 710 days to twice per month and is experimenting with \"nogrow\" or \"lowmow\" grasses to reduce mowing. In addition, a number of naturalized lawn projects hav e been implemented on City property; The City's Environmental Commission and Sustainability Commission work very hard to foster policies that nurture environmental, social, and economic health and have issued critical reports on the city's greenhouse gas emissions, environmental quality indicators, sustainability indicators and greenspace; 50 The City has been named Tree City USA for 24 consecutive years. The City nurtures more than 18,000 trees in the urban forest and thousands more in the City's parks. These are laudable efforts. Howe ver, to mitigate the effects of peak oil, we need to do far more. Responding to peak oil, climate change, and energy uncert ainty requires an across theboard dedicated shift to red uced energy consumption and gre ater local production. In thinking through what the adv ent of peak oil means for the o peration of government, it is important to keep in mi nd that the Task Force is not anticipating reduced or somehow compromised City services. To the contrary, the Task Force urges us to think through ways the City will fulfill its role of protecting community wellbeing by being smart and creative about the ways we use and produce energy. 50 City of Bloomington Environmental Commission & City of Bloomington Commission on Sustainability, Greenhouse Gas Inventory for the City of Bloomington, Indiana: Footprint, Projections, and Recommendations (May 2009) https://bloomington.in.gov/media /media/application/pdf/5047.pdf ; City of Bloomington Environmental Commission 2006 Bloomington Environmental Quality Indicator (BEQI) Report, http://bloomington.in.gov/beqi/ ; Bloomington Commission on Sustainability, Bloomington Sustainability Assessment Report (2008) http://bloomington.in.gov/medi a/media/application/pdf/4660.pdf ; City of Bloomington Environmental Commission , Greenspace Trends in Bloomington, Indiana 1993\u00ad2007, http://bloomington.in.go v/egov/docs/1196711026_93260.pdf Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 39 VULNERABILITIES Of the many services the City provides, among the most critical are: the provision of potable water, a sanitary sewer system, police and fire protect ion, and waste removal. These services are energy intens ive. A decline in cheap oil e xposes the following vulnerabilities: 1. Direct Increase in Costs & Price Volatility As the price of oil both becomes more volatile and more expensi ve, so will the price of electricity, natural gas, and other energy resources. It will become more expensive for the City to: treat and pump drinking water, treat its wastewater, provide fuel for law enforcement and fire protection, heat and cool municipal buildings, and pick up trash and recycling. 2. Indirect Increase in Costs & Price Volatility Because energy is embedded in just about everything we do and p urchase, it is expected that the City will also experience an increase in the cost of products in which oil and oil byproducts are used. Perhaps one of the most severe indirect impacts will be an increase in t he cost of food as the cost of production and transportation increases. 3. Ever\u00adincreasing Energy Shortages and Outages As the supply of cheap oil conti nues to drop, we can expect gre ater oil scarcity and periods of blackouts and bro wnouts (when power is reduced). We must prepare the City's storage, back up generation and primary energy generation systems for this shift. 51 These vulnerabilities call for a plan that seeks to build resiliency into the City infrastructure. The aim of this chapter is to map out an \"ener gy descent\" plan that meets the needs of the community eff iciently and fairly. As this Report enters the community's conversation, it is assumed - an d expected - that both the City staff and residents will have even more ideas about how to plan for peak oil. The intent of this chapter is to get the conversation started. 51 These three vulnerabilities are borrowed, in part, from those outlined by the Sebastopol Ad Hoc Citizens Advisory Group on Energy Vulnerability, Charting a Path for a New Energy Future for Sebastopol (2007). City HallReport of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 40THIRSTY WATER: THE WATER SUPPLY Since the first cisterns were built on the Courthouse Square in 1860, the City has experienced water shortages caused by weather, lack of natural water supplies, and storage imbalances. However, present conditions pose another vu lnerability: the grid. Water treatment requires electricity (a functioning grid) or ba ckup electricity generation using diesel fuel. Without a ste ady supply of electricity or di esel fuel, the City will experience a significant reduction or suspension of water treat ment services. That our current electrical grid is both aging and overloaded i s well documented. Indeed, the U.S. National Power Grid rec eived a \"D+\" by the American So ciety of Civil Engineers in 2009.52 Peak oil has immediate implicat ions for the grid. First, in I ndiana, the grid runs primarily on coal, and coal rel ies heavily on liquid fuels for its extraction. Secondly, the grid will be even more taxed as we start powering our cars, buses, and trains with electricity rather than oil, and start heating our homes, offic es, businesses, etc. with electricity rather than natural gas. 53 The grid might also experie nce more stress if people perceive electricity as bearing a significantly smaller carbon footprint than petroleum. However, fully 95 percent of Ind iana's electricity is generated by coal, while 5 percent is generated by natural gas.54 The finite supply of Indiana's coal is discussed in Appendix II. 52 American Society of Civil Engineers, 2009 Report Card for America's Infrastructure, http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/sites/default/files/RC2009_full_report.pdf . It is also important to that the Society gave the U.S. Drinking W ater Supply a grade of \"D,\" Wastewater a grade of \"D,\" and Dams a grade of \"D.\" 53 See Appendix III for a discussion of the peaking of natural gas. 54 Energy Information Administration. State Electricity Profile: Indiana http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/s tate_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=IN Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 41 Water Supply The City's water supply is sourc ed from Lake Monroe. Lake Monro e is located approximately seven miles southe ast of Bloomington and has been in operation since 1966. Lake Monroe has been the City's sole source of treated water since the Griffy Lake Water Treatment Plant was retired from service in 1996. The City of Bloomington Utilities Department (CBU) provides for the treatment and distribution of the community's water supply. Lake Monroe was constructed and is owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and is managed by the Indiana Departmen t of Natural Resources (IDNR). The lake is used for water supply, flood control, and recreation. Between the silt p ool elevation of 515 feet (ft) above mean sea level (msl) and t he flood control pool elevation of 538 ft msl, the reservoir will provide a total storage ca pacity of 159,900 acre feet. 55 The City purchases raw water und er an existing purchase agreeme nt with IDNR for the Monroe Water Treatment Plant ( WTP) for $33.00/million gallons. The City pumps an average of 16.1 million gallons of water per day. Its agreement with IDNR allows for the City to purchase water up to a l imit of an annual average daily withdrawal of 24 million gallons per day.56 The City has frequently come cl ose to this maximum withdrawal. In 2006, the City received an \"Early Warning Order\" from the India na Department of Environmental Management that th e City's highest daily pumpage, as reported over the previous two years, exceeds 90 percent of the system's 24 milli on gallonsperday capacity.57 55 The lake has a drainage area of 432 square miles, a spillway e levation of 556.0 ft, and a maximum water elevation of 556.2 ft msl recorded on May 15, 2002. 56 Black & Veatch, Water Supply Evaluation , 41 (2007). 57 The Order advised that a failure to implement any proposed impr ovements \"is cause for imposing a connection ban on your system.\" Lake Monroe Dam and Control Tower, Source: U.S. ACE Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 42Water Treatment Treatment of water from Lake Monroe includes rapid mixing, sedi mentation, filtration, and disinfection. The facility is connected to the Bloomington wate r distribution system by a single 36inch transmission main that conveys treated water app roximately seven to eight miles from the plant to the City . In the event of a complete lo ss of electrical power, the City can produce potable water at a r ate of 12 million gallons per d ay provided that No. 2 diesel fuel can be replaced in the tanks for the standby engine genera tors. As stated in a commissioned evaluation of the City's water supply, \"Any interr uption in service, either at the water treatment plant, along the transmission main, or with any of the critical ancillary water treatment facilities, for more than a few hours could res ult in a significant reduction or total suspension of water service to CBU's customers.\"58 The City maintains two backup d iesel generators: one at the L ow Service Pump Station (on the shore of Lake Monroe) an d one at the Monroe Water Treatment Plant (about one half mile the Lake). Each generat or has a 1,000 gallon fuel tan k. The engine of each is rated to consume 57.8 gallons per hour under full load operating cond itions. Therefore, 2,000 gallons of fuel would be consumed in 17.3 hours if both engine generators were operating at full load conditions. The City currently maintains sev en active water storage tanks a nd is requesting an additional tank. Under normal usage conditions, the seven activ e tanks provide approximately eight hours of capa city. A combined liquid fuels shortage and protracted grid failure would leave little buffer for City water users. 58 Black & Veatch, Water Supply Evaluation, ES4 (2007). Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 43VULNERABILITIES Production of Bloomington's water is energy intensive and produ ces a large quantity of Bloomington's greenhouse gas emi ssions. The treatment and pumpi ng of water requires approximately one million kilowat t hours per month. This usage translates into a price tag of almost $60,000 per month. 59 Grid vulnerability means two thi ngs. First, as oil becomes more costly, it is reasonable to anticipate that individuals and institutions will power their v ehicles and heat their homes and other buildings with electri city. This will put increased strain on an aging grid and will trigger more frequent grid failure. Therefore, we must think through ways to provide water in light of a compromised grid. Secondly, we know that as the demand for electricity rises, so too will its price. It is only sound fiscal policy th at we address ways in which we might lower the cost of treating water. Given the City's commi tment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, any pr udent remedy will not call for increased carbon emission.60 Lastly, Bloomingtonians use a lo t of water. Subtracting out the IU oncampus housing population, Bloomington residents use an average of 85 gallons per capita per day.61 In the U.S., typical domestic indoor per capita water use is 80100 gallons per capita per day;62 outdoor water use can increase th at rate to as much as 165 gall ons per day.63 Meanwhile, the average (western, industrialized) European uses an average of 53 gallons per day.64 59 This energy is supplied by Duke Power primarily from coal comb ustion plants. Because of combustion inefficiencies and transmission lin e losses, an estimated 6,600 short tons of coal per year are burned to generate the power to treat and pump water to Bloomington area re sidents, resulting in carbon d ioxide releases to the atmos phere of about 19,000 tons, or 1 lb. of CO2 for each 134 gallons of water treated and delivered. 60 Mayor Kruzan has signed the May or's Climate Protection Agreem ent and the City Council has endorsed ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.

Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 44MITIGATION GOALS & STRATEGIES A commitment to smart water management involves comprehensive planning to meet the longterm needs of the community joined with greater efficienci es and a strong conservation ethic. SHORT\u00ad TERM STRATEGIES (1\u00ad5 years) 1. Explore hybrid energy generation. While the Monroe Water Treatment plant enjoys some flexibility to scale down production, it does not have the capacity to run without power. Water production and treatment requires a continual input of po wer. The plant cannot be frequ ently completely shut down and then turned on again without negative consequences. Given the precarious state of the grid and the need for continu ous power at the plant, the City should explore alternative energy options to supplement th e water treatment plant's energy supply. Specifically, the City should explore the possib ility of installing a second layer of pumps powered by a combination of both solar energy and hydroelectricity from the Monroe Dam. At the request of the City's En vironmental Commission and some members of the City Council, the Utilities Departmen t sent Black and Veatch a list of general questions concerning the possible use of alternative energy sources to power the water treatment plant. In October 2008, lead engi neer Donnie Ginn, P.E., responded to these questions via a memorandum. 65 Ginn's memorandum advised that completely transitioning the facilities to either hydroelectric power or sol ar power is significantly cons trained by space, season, and cost. For example, hydroelectric power generated at the dam wo uld have to be transferred about 10 miles over difficult terrain to the water treatment intake facility. Furthermore, the facility could only be opera ted for a few months in the late spring. Meanwhile, 65 Memo from Donnie Ginn of Black and Veatch to Patrick Murphy, Di rector of City of Bloomington Utilities Department, Monroe Water Treatment Plant Alternative Energy Sources (October 21, 2008). Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 45transitioning the entire plant over to solar power would call f or clearing between 16 to 40 acres of land for solar cells.66 Instead of completely shifting t he treatment and intake facility over to either solar or hydroelectric power, the City sh ould explore a hybrid configura tion of both to complement (not replace) the facility's primary source of power. Such a h ybrid configuration should be designed to produce enough power to run the plant at 1015% tre atment capacity in order to provide residents a basic level of water sufficient for drin king, cooking, and basic sanitation. Hydroelectric power could be leveraged during the Indiana spring rains, when substantial cloud cover reduces the feasibility for solar but t here is a great deal of untapped energy flowing over the dam. Solar power could be leveraged du ring the summer months and sunny winter months. 67 Used as part of a hybrid sy stem to complement existing power sources, solar panels woul d require less than an acre of cleared land (estimated). In the interest of the community's water security, the City sho uld more closely examine hybrid energy generation at the water treatment plant. Any st udy should take into consideration the amount of wate r needed to provide minimal dri nking and cooking water to residents. Further study sho uld include a costbenefit tha t takes into account the weaknesses of the elect rical grid and the grid's ultimate reliance on oil. 66 Ibid. 67 Cities receiving less solar radi ation than Bloomington, such as Newark, New Jersey have successfully transitioned their water and was tewater treatment to solar powe r. Boulder, Colorado has a level of radiation similar to Bloomington and has transitioned its water and waste water treatment facilities to solar power. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 462. Advocate a tiered pricing system whereby consumers pay a rate based on consumption . The Mayor has expressed an interest in pursuing a rate structur e to encourage water conservation.68 The proposal must be approved b y the Indiana Regulatory Commi ssion.69 A tieredrate structure would mean that the unit price of consumption would increase after usage exceeds a predetermined basic monthly amount. While any s uch rate must be non discriminatory (e.g., must not discriminate against larger famil ies), linking price to use will go some distance in reducing dem and - peak and otherwise. In A thensClarke County, Georgia - an oftcited college town comparable to Bloomington - rates are based on each customer's winter average. Offic ials in that community estimat e that this rate structure will save approximately one milli on gallons of water per day in the summer when use is at its peak.70 3. Encourage rainwater capture. Outdoor water use can comprise 25% to 58% of overall domestic w ater demand.71 Rainwater harvesting has signifi cant potential to reduce stormw ater runoff while conserving potable water. Rainwater capture offers a number of advantages:72 provides an inexpensive supply of water; reduces stormwater runoff and pollution; reduces erosion in urban environment; provides water that needs little treatment for irrigation or no npotable indoor uses; helps reduce peak summer demands; and helps introduce demand management for drinking water systems. 68 State of the City Address, 2009. 69 Indiana Code \u00a7 81.538 governs rates and charges for municip al utilities and require s that rates must be \"nondiscriminatory, reasonable, and just.\" \"Reasonable and just \" charges are defined as paying for all of the necessary costs of the utility, including maintenance, operatin g charges, upkeep, repairs, depreciation, bond interest, and the costs of ex tensions and r eplacements. 70 http://www.athensclarkecounty.com/documen ts/pdf/publicutilities /water_conservation_rates.pdf 71 Christopher Kloss, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Managing Wet Weather with Green Infrastructure: Municipal Handbook - Rainwater Harvesting Policies, i_munichandbook_harvesting.pdf 72 Texas Rainwater Harvesting Evaluation Committee, Rainwater Harvesting Potential and Guidelines for Texas, Report to the 80th Legislature, Texas Water Development Board, Austin, TX (Novemb er 2003). Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 47 The City can do much to encourage and increase rainwater capture for use on lawns and gardens. Following the lead of other communities, the City should: Provide rain barrels to community members at a reduced cost, much the way it did when it offered compost bins at a reduced rate (in cooperation with the Center for Sustainable Living). It is estimated that a 55 gallon rain barrel can save approximately 1,300 gallons of water in peak summer months;73 Implement a rain barrel rebate program;74 Require greywater and roofwater catchment for new development as part of the City's Unified Development Ordinance (UDO). Currently, the UDO provides incentives for the use of greywater, but does not require it. 75 The City might look to Tucson, Arizona - the first city in the US to require rainwater harvesting for landscaping use. In Tucson, effective June 1, 2 010, 50% of a commercial property's irrigation water must be supplied from rainwater. In addition to cisterns, the regula tions allow berms and contoured slopes to be used to direct rainwater to trees and landscaped areas; 76 Require bioswales and/or permeable paving for any new development; and The City should lead by example by installing cisterns and rain barrels to provide for its own landscaping needs. 73 U.S. E.P.A., What is a Rain Barrel? http://www.epa.gov/Region3/p2/whatisrainbarrel.pdf 74 For example, see the cistern rebate program offered by James, Virginia http://www.bewatersmart .org/RebatePrograms/rainbarrelrebateprog ram/FAQ.html#rainbarrel 75 \u00a720.05.049, Bloomington Municipal Code. http://bloomington.in.gov/greenbuildingincentives 76 http://www.ci.tucson.az.u s/agdocs/20081014/oct1408564a.pdf Commercially sized cistern at the Chicago Center for Green Technology. Source: Abby Hall, EPA. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 484. Offer other efficiency incentives. The City should implement incent ives to encourage water conserv ation such as: subsidies for lowflush toilets and lowflow shower heads, toilet displacement devices, and faucet aerators; and rebates for energyefficient appliances, such as washing machines; and (See Sustenance chapter for other possible incentives.) 5. Expand storage capacity. Expanding water storage capacity may be prudent for limitedtime emergencies and should be explored. However, this is mi tigation for the short term, n ot one for the l ong emergency. As spelled out in a recent wate r supply evaluation commissioned by the City: During shortterm maximum water use conditions, it may be possible to utilize additional storage in the distribution system. The implementation of additional storage within the distribution sy stem should be carefully analyzed with distribution system operations and is not recommended for long peri ods of maximum water use. The u se of additional storage may lead to water quality concerns within the distribution system under ma ximum and normal operating conditions. Additionally, the ab ility to replenish the distribu tion system storage would be limited by the existing treatment and pumping capacity and may not be available for effective use dur ing long periods of maximum water use.77 6. Transition all back\u00adup generators to renewable sources of energy, such as biomass or biogas. As discussed earlier, both backu p generators for the City's water treatment are designed to run 17 hours on a full fuel t ank of diesel. In the interest of redundancy, we should explore how these generators mig ht be transitioned to renewable sources of energy. At minimum, the generators should be flexfitted to run on biodies el. Ideally, such generators could be run on biomass or biogas. 77 Black & Veatch, Water Supply Evaluation, 41 (2007). Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 497. The City should re\u00adexamine the \"Summer Sewer Average\" With the \"Summer Sewer Average,\" utilities customers' wastewater bills during the summer months are based on their presummer average water usage , rather than actual water usage. This practice encou rages discretionary watering in the summer - lawn watering, car washing, etc. Whil e an end to this average would likely foster greater conservation, the City should ex plore whether, in light of anti cipated increased urban gardening, ending this practice would be prudent. 8. Develop an Emergency Ration & Education Plan From timetotime, the Utilities Department has been called upon to create contingency plans. To date, the Department has not experienced an emergenc y with which it has not been able to sufficiently cope. However, complete grid failure presents a different picture. Utilities currently has \"What to do if\" emergency guides for ea ch physical location, but they are limited to identifying hazards and suggesting notification and evacuation scenarios. The guides are not up to date. Utilities should develop a comp rehensive, systemwide emergency ration and education p lan to prepare for complete gri d failure. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 50 MEDIUM \u00adTERM (515 years) 1. Explore the possibility of using smart meters to track water consumption. A smart water meter would identify consumption in more detail than a conventional m eter and would communicate that information back via a ne twork to CBU for monitoring and billing purposes. This would give the consumer better feedback on use and cut out the need for staff to visit individual homes to read meter s. Such technology has been successfully implemented in college communities such as Ann Arbor, Michigan 78 and was recently instituted throughout Britain.79 2. The City should continue to expand its alternative energy generation so that it derives 25% of its water treatment from alternative energy by 2025. LONG\u00adTERM (15\u00ad30 years) 1. The City should strive to make its water treatment and processing completely grid independent . 2. The City should work toward more neighborhood \u00adbased cistern options for potable water. While harvested rainwater could be used as potable water, the r equired onsite treatment and perceived public health conce rns represent cultural hurdles . These hurdles will take a long time to address, but a long term goal is to transition to more use of neighborhood cisterns. 78 http://blog.tdworld. com/briefingroom/2009/03/25/cityofannarb orwinsmeteringinternational s Broad SmartMetering Plan,\" The New York Times, May 12, 2009 http://greeninc.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/britainannounces broadsmartmeter plan/?scp=4&sq=peak%20oil&st=cse Source: Associated Press Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 513. Explore re\u00ad activating the Lake Griffy Treatment Facility. The Lake Griffy Treatment Facility was decommissioned in 1996. In 2003, the City's Long Range Water Capital Plan (LRWCP) examined the possibility of re viving Lake Lemon/Bean Blossom Creek and Griffy Lake as alternative sources. Subsequen tly, it was determined that these sources should not be considered due to higher costs asso ciated with capital improvement projects, water quality concerns, and concerns about sufficient yields from these sources.80 At approximately 3.23 miles from the city center, Lake Griffy i s significantly closer to Bloomington residents than is Lake Monroe, which is at least seven miles away. Given the proximity to the city and the n eed to build in more redundancy into a highlycentralized water treatment system, this opt ion warrants reexamination. 80 Black and Veatch, Water Supply Evaluation , 41 (2007). Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 52WASTE DISPOSAL: THE DETRITUS OF CONSUMPTION Waste is a systemic and inevitab le aspect of our community. Yet, our everincreasing consumption of goods and their easy disposal has led to a very energyintensive waste disposal infrastructure. Rethin king our consumption and dispos al habits with peak oil in mind has the potential to lead t o greater cost savings to the taxpayers, increased efficiencies, and greater community resilience. SOLID WASTE & RECYCLING Trash inhabits an important, but invisible, cultural space in o ur community. It requires setting boundaries and setting m argins, both physically and sym bolically.81 Out of sight, out of mind. At certain intervals - usually weekly - we put our ga rbage out by the curb and a truck takes it away. However, ma king trash \"go away\" by putting it on a truck is a fuel intensive process. A REVIEW OF THE CURRENT SITUATION The City of Bloomington Sanitatio n Division collects residentia l solid waste, yard waste, and recyclable material from a pproximately 8,000 households wit hin City limits. The City collects neither trash nor recycl ables from residences of more than four units. Bloomington residents pay a $2.00 fee for each 35gallon trash bag or container collected by the City, and a $1.00 per bag fee for yard waste. Curbside r ecycling, which began in 1991, is free of charge. Materials eligible for recycling in Bl oomington and Monroe County include paper products, glass containers, steel cans, aluminum cans, and plastic bottles. The City also collects leaves and yard waste. The City's Sanit ation Division picks up yard waste from early March to earl y January and takes it to Good Ea rth Compost and Mulch, LLC for mulching. Both the City's Sanitation Division and Stre et Division provide leaf pick up services. 81 Mary Douglas, Purity and Danger: An Analysis of the Concepts of Pollution and Taboo, Routledge, 1966. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 53From early November to late December, residents are afforded th ree options to dispose of their leaves: City Sanitation crews will collect yard waste every week on you r scheduled trash day in the free leaf collection bags; Residents can drop leaves off at any of five collection sites; and The Street Division provides a curbside leaf pick up on a regul ar basis Monday through Friday. While the leaves collected by the City are taken to Good Earth for composting, the leaves collected by the Street division are taken to a decommissioned City wastewater plant contaminated by PCBs where the leaves are used for fill. The City's Sanitation Division o wns approximately 17 vehicles. In 2008, the Division consumed 1,584.84 gallons of unleaded and 24,475.79 gallons of diesel. The Sanitation Division has gone to a condensed work week of four 10hour work days and has cut its unleaded fuel costs by 37%. Its diesel costs have remained larg ely unchanged, despite increasing fuel prices. Until recently, much of the soli d waste generated locally was t aken to the Monroe County Landfill, which was operated by the Monroe County Solid Waste M anagement District. However, the landfill suspended operations during the summer of 2004 after it erupted into flames. It was subsequently closed and is under contract t o remain closed until 2024. At present, the majority of the City's solid waste is hauled to Sycamore Ridge Landfill, located in Pimento, IN (Vigo Cou nty), about 55 miles from Bloomington. In 2007, 159,968 tons of solid waste was generated in Monroe Co unty.82 Based on U.S. Census figures, Bloomington residents constitute about 56% of t he Monroe County population. 83 Therefore, we might estimate that Bloomington residents genera ted about 82Indiana Department of Environmental Management, 2007 Solid Waste Facilities Report http://www.in.gov/idem/files/solid_waste_far07.pdf 83 U.S. Census Bureau; Indiana Business Research Center Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 5489,582 tons of garbage in 2007.84 The U.S. Environmental Protec tion Agency estimates that since 1960, the amount of waste e ach person generates has incre ased from 2.7 pounds per day to 4.62 pounds per day - from 985 pounds a year to 1,686 pounds per year.85 VULNERABILITIES 1. The collection of waste and recyclables is essentially a trucking function, wholly reliant on liquid fuel for operation. While the City's Sanitation Division has taken the prudent step toward reducing vehicle miles travelled and saving the t axpayers money by moving to a f ourday work week, its functioning is still wholly dependent upon liquid fuels. Given a dramatic decline in cheap fuel, the Division would have to reduce all collection services and possibly eliminate its appliance collection service and/or pass on the increased costs to residents. This might result in some residents not pay ing for trash disposal and inst ead illegally dumping their garbage in undesirable places. A fuel shortage might also resu lt in an inability to pick up trash, resulting in illegal trash dumping and/or accumulation of trash at residences - both threats to public health. 2. The transport of our community waste 55 miles away is wholly dependent on the availability of liquid fuel. In the absence of a local dispos al site, the community would li kely have to continue shipping its waste out of the community. Again, rising costs of such shipping due to fuel scarcity would likely be passed on to residents with the aforem entioned consequences. 84 Note that this figure includes trash picked up by the City fro m residences with four o r fewer unit s, multi family units serviced by private haulers and trash hauled from Indiana University. 85 US EPA, Municipal Solid Waste in the United States: 2007 Facts and Figures, EPA530R08010, 134; See further, Elizabeth Royte, Garbage Land: On the Secret Trail of Trash, 275 (2005). Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 553. Yard trimmings and food waste unduly burden the City's waste collection operations. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that y ard trimmings and food residuals together constitute 24 percent of the U.S. municipal solid waste stream.86 In 2008, the Sanitation Division collected 470 truck loads of y ard waste. In 2008, the Division collected 420 truck loa ds of leaves. As leaves are nut rientrich and good for improving lawns and gardens, the City's provision of leafremov al services is not only expensive and fuel intensive, it discourages a change in thinking whereby more residents think of leaves as food for the soil, rather than \"waste.\" While the City has in place a program for picking up yard waste , it does not provide for compostable food residuals. Tha t's a lot of waste to send to l andfills when it could become useful and environmentally beneficial compost instead. 87 Not only does the collection and transport of such material remov e a lot of potential compost, b ut such organic matter produces significant greenhouse gas emissions when landfilled. 86 U.S. E.P.A. Wastes \u00ad Resource Conservation \u00ad Reduce, Reuse, Recycle - Composting. http://www.epa.gov/waste/conse rve/rrr/composting/basic.htm 87 Ibid. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 56 MITIGATION GOALS & STRATEGIES SHORT\u00ad TERM STRATEGIES (1\u00ad5 years) 1. Residents should be encouraged to buy less stuff - especially non\u00adlocal stuff. According to the E.P.A., \"source reduction\" is one of the most effective ways to reduce waste disposal and handling cost s, because it avoids the costs of recycling, municipal composting, landfilling, and combustion. Source reduction also conserves resources and reduces pollution, including greenhouse gases.88 Most of what we buy is decidedly not local. More effective than recycling and reusing is just buying less stuff. Not only will limiting consumption save money, but if paired with a \"buy local\" prioritization of basic goods (see Economic Context), it will reduce the volume of material we send to the landfill and promote economic resilience through relocalization. 2. The City should provide educational outreach to the community about the benefits of composting leaves and table scraps with the goal of reducing its leaf pick\u00adup services by 50% in five years. Like other recycling efforts, th e composting of yard trimmings and food scraps can help decrease the amount of solid waste tha t must be sent to a landfill, ther eby reducing disposal costs. According to the E.P.A., food w aste alone comprises about 12 percent of what a typical US American throws away every day; yet, only 2 percent of that is composted. 89 Composting yields a valuable product that can be used by homeowners, farmers, landscapers, horticulturists, go vernment agencies, and property owners as a soil amendment or mulch. Cities such as Toronto, Oakland, Seattle, and Portland ha ve implemented citysponsored composting programs. 88 U.S. E.P.A.

Source: U.S. EPA Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 57 3. The City should establish a neighborhood compost collection program. It should use this compost for community gardens, especially those which benefit local hunger relief programs. As described in the Sustenance chapter, a decline in cheap oil will result in greater food insecurity, especially among eco nomicallyvulnerable population s. Programs for growing food within the city will need to be expanded. The City should begin to identify sites for neighborhood composts. 4. The City should work toward encouraging existing apartment complexes to provide recycling services to their tenants and should require any new apartment development to do so. Currently, the City picks up waste and recycling only from residences which contain four or fewer units. Buildings of five o r more units may or may not provide recycling services to their tenants. The City should w ork toward encouraging existing apartment complexes to provide recycling and should req uire any new apartment developm ent to do so. 5. The City should support the establishment of a community materials recovery facility. The Monroe County Solid Waste Di strict currently outsources the processing of paper, cardboard, aluminum, glass and pl astic. Currently, these recyc lables are taken to Indianapolis for processing. F rom 20052008, the District outs ourced processing for 11,575 tons of paper, cardboard, aluminum and plastics. Those items were valued at more than $1.25 million, but the District only received about $275,000 in rebates. A local recovery facility would likely n ot only generate revenue, but w ould keep such processing local, obviating the need to tran sport the community's recyclab les 50+ miles. Should such transport become costprohibitive, localizing this service make s our community more resilient. The City should work with other community stakehold ers to support this effort. Similarly, as the City works to promote composting, it should c onsider the establishment of a community organic materials rec overy facility. See further t he Sustenance chapter. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 58MEDIUM \u00adTERM STRATEGIES (5\u00ad15 years) 1. The City should establish landfill diversion targets and waste reduction goals. Based on City waste collection data, the community recycles approximately 34% of its waste. In the interest of reduci ng the amount of waste sent to the landfill, many other communities have established was tereduction targets and many h ave set zero waste goals.90 Bloomington should set an ambitious goal for a Zero Waste Bloomington by 2040. To get there, the City should resolve to: reduce per capita waste disposal by 20% by 2014; encourage composting on residential, industrial, and commercial sites; and require recycling and composting services for all new developme nt. 2. The City should consider ways in which it could promote the processing and use of locally\u00adgenerated recyclable material. Specifically, the City should sp onsor a study to evaluate the potential for local manufacturing of products made from locallygenerated recycled materials. For example, the City of San Francisco has im plemented an innovative trashintofuel program whereby fats, oils, and grease from households, restaurants, etc. are d iverted away from the solid waste and wastewater streams and toward the City fleet by conve rting the waste to biofuel. A similar program in Bloomington would foster energy independen ce by providing alternate fuel for the City flee t, while at the same time provi ding businesses and residents with a cheaper and cleaner option for waste disposal.91 90 Zero waste goals have been set b y a number of other communities, such as San Francisco, CA; Austin, TX; Portland, OR; Oakland, CA; Seattle, WA 91 See http://www.sfgreasecycle.org/thedish.shtml Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 59LONG\u00adTERM STRATEGIES (15\u00ad30 years) 1. Re\u00adopen the Monroe County Landfill and tap it for biogas. That the City ships almost 86,000 tons of waste 55 miles poses a serious threat in a post peak Bloomington. The City should work with other community st akeholders to examine the feasibility of reactivating the Monroe County Landfill after its contractuallyrequired closure period ends in 2024. The Monroe County Solid Waste Man agement District is investigating the feasibility of a biogastoenergy system at t he Landfill. The City should fully support such an inquiry. If reopening the landfill is not feasible, the City should wor k with other community stakeholders to explore establishing a new, local landfill and tapping it for biogas. According to the EPA: Municipal solid waste landfills a r e t h e s e c o n d l a r g e s t s o u r c e o f human related methane emissions in the United States, accounting for nearly 23 percent of these emissions in 2006. At the same time, methane e missions from landfills represent a lost opportunity to capture and use a significant energy resource.92 Landfill gas should not be releas ed and allowed to migrate into the atmosphere. It can be captured, converted, and used as an energy source. Such biogas can be used to generate energy, to directly offset the u se of another fuel (e.g., natur al gas, coal, oil), for co generation (producing both elect ricity and thermal energy), and even to produce alternate fuels (delivered to the natural gas pipeline and/or converted t o vehicle fuel in the form of compressed natural gas or liquefied natural gas.).93 Landfill biogastoenergy systems are not uncommon. As of 2008, the E.P.A. reports that there were approximately 480 such energy projects in the U.S. a nd 520 landfills that were good candidates. At least three landfills in Indiana are generating energy.94 92 Landfill Methane Outreach Program, http://www.epa.gov/landfill/overview.htm 93 Ibid. 94 Logansport, Liberty and Clark & Floyd counties. A description of the Logansport and Liberty projects at: \"Two Indiana Landfills now generating electricity,\" The Chicago Tribune (October 20, 2008). http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2008/oct/20/news/chiapintrashtoenergy Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 60Reestablishing a local landfill will be critical in a postpea k community. Not only will the relocalization of our waste drastically reduce the amount of fuel used to transport the trash, but a landfill using a landfilltobiogas system strengt hens our community's commitment to cleaner air, renewable energy, economic developme nt, improved public welfare and safety, and redu ctions in greenhouse gases. \"Together, the Logansp ort and Liberty landfills now generate en ough electricity to power about 5,100 homes. Beasy said that the 3.1megawatt Oakridge plant generates the same amount of electricity each year as 50,000 barrels of oil. Since going online, he said the site has produced 131 million kilowat ts of electricity - or the equivalent of 267,917 barrels o f oil. He said the Oakridge facility about 40 miles northeast of Lafayette uses four generator engines that churn out 3,100 kilowatts of e lectricity per hour.\" ClarkFloyd Landfill Methane Gene ration Project description via Hoosier Energy: http://www.hepn.com /clarkfloyd.asp Hoosier Energy has constructed an electricity generation plant at the Clark-Floyd Landfill that produces two megawatts of renewable energy At two megawatts of capacity, the $4 million landf ill generation project provides enough electricity for about 1,200 typical homes. The landfill is lo cated on a 400-acre site in Clark County. The project received a $100,000 Alte rnative Power and Energy Program grant from the Indiana Office of Energy and Defense Development. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 61WASTEWATER The City operates two wastewater treatment facilities - the Dil lman Road Treatment Plant and the Blucher Poole Plant. Both employ systems of aerobic digestion as part of their treatment processes. The Dillman Plant has a design capacity of 15 million gallons daily and a peak hydraulic capacity in excess of 30 million gallons daily . The Blucher Poole Plant has a design capacity of 6 million g allons per day and a peak hydra ulic capacity of 12 million gallons per day. VULNERABILITIES The treatment of the City's wastewater consumes approximately 1,141,000 KWh per month. As with water treatment, the electricity required to run these plants relies on the burning of coal. The extraction of coal relies heavily on petr oleum inputs. Therefore, our wastewater treatment processes are vulnerable to volatile oil p rices and an aging grid. MITIGATION GOALS & STRATEGIES SHORT\u00ad TERM (1\u00ad5 years) 1. Encourage greater water conservation The vulnerabilities inherent in the treatment of wastewater are similar to those associated with water treatment and distrib ution. Perhaps the most immedi ate and decidedly low tech solution to a vulnerable wa stewater system is to reduce th e amount of wastewater circulating through it. Conserv ing water and using energyeffi cient appliances will help reduce some of the pressure on the system. These mitigation str ategies are mapped out in the Water Supply section above and in the Sustenance chapter. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 622. Transition all back\u00adup generators to renewable sources of energy, such as biomass. Currently, both treatment plants rely on diesel backup generators. The Dillman Plant has one generator on site that hol ds 1,000 gallons of fuel and will provide 8 hours of power. The Blucher Plant has one generator on site that holds 3,000 ga llons of fuel and will provide 60 hours of power. As is recommended for the treatme nt of water, the Task Force recommends that the City should explore how these generat ors might be transitioned to re newable sources of energy. At minimum, the generators should be flexfitted to run on biodiesel. Ideally, such generators could be run on biomass or biogas. 3. Make better use of biosolids. At present, the Utilities Department deposits all treated sewag e sludge - biosolids - at its Dillman Road Treatment biomass landfill. It is expected that the landfill will be at capacity in four to five years. If Utilit ies continues to landfill the sludge, it will have to send it the way of all other City solid waste - to the Sycamore Ridge Landf ill, 55 miles away. However, this sewage sludge is a potential resource. In the US, approximately 50% of suitable biomass is recycled to land in the form of fertilizer. 95 The City should consider using this for fertilization of nonfood pla nts, such as those grown for b iofuels or feedstock. However, as is required by the EPA, it is imperative that any biomass spread on local fields be free of harmful contaminants. 95 Note that to apply biomass to land, the biomass must meet strict quality criteri a as spell out in 40 CFR Part 503, See http://www.epa.gov/OWOWM.html/mtb/biosolids/503pe/index.htm Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 63LONG\u00adTERM (15\u00ad30 years) 1. Explore sludge\u00ad to\u00adbiogas energy generation Wastewater is a rich source of o rganic matter, nutrients, and m inerals. The products of such wastes are potentially valua ble resources, both as energy and as reusable compounds such as phosphorus.96 Indeed, research has demonstrate d that sewage actually contain s 10 times the energy needed to treat it.97 A number of widelyte sted energy recovery technologies have emerged to recover this energy. Perhaps the most common way to extract energy is the sludgeto biogas (methane) process. However, such a process is reliant on anaerobic digest ion. While it would likely be very costly to transition the City's current aerobic digestion system to an anaerobic one capable of producing energy, the City should explore such a shi ft in the long term. Such energy could be used directly for wastewater treatment, reducing the facility's dependency on conventional electricity. Using solids as a resource rather than a waste may help stressed public budgets as well. Wastewater solids must be processed prior to disposal, and solids handling accounts for as much as 30 percent of a wastewa ter treatment facility's costs. 98 Furthermore, elements like phosp horus are becoming increasingly scarce, and the recovery and renewability of these resour ces is becoming economically an d ecologically attractive. Phosphorus recovery can reduce s ludge volumes produced by up to 30 percent. In addition to exploring sludgetobiogas pr oduction, the City should closely examine the f easibility of phosphorus recovery. 96 Phosphorus is a growthlimiting n utrient that is discharged to the environment through municipal sewage. The impacts of phosphorus discharge include severe eutrophication of fresh water bodies. The US EPA has made clear that the future sustainable use of phosphorus mu st include recovery from municipal sewage and reprocessing as a fertilizer.

Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 64 POLICE, FIRE & OTHER EMERGENCY SERVICES Police and fire protection and other emergency services are amo ng the most important services a government can provide. However, they are also the most vulnerable to a decline in cheap oil. Peak oil presents emergency services with twin challenges: a decline in fuel with which to respond to emergencies and potential soci al unrest due to fuel shortages and economic disruptions. POLICE DEPARTMENT The City of Bloomington Police Department (BPD) is a fullservi ce police agency, providing police protection to a city of a pproximately 72,000 residents and a land area of approximately 20 square miles. Th e Police Department employs 92 sworn officers and 36 civilian employees. The Department is a very visible one and s uch visibility helps keep crime low in our community. The BPD maintains 45 vehicles. Over the last three years, the Department has used an average o f about 5,360 gallons of gas a month. That keeps about 12 police cars on the street patrollin g and responding to calls. BPD is one of the City's most fuelintens ive departments. In 2008, the Dep artment used 64,109 gallons of unleaded fuel and 84 gallons of diesel - about 3,613 gallons less fuel than it used in 2007. Despite thi s reduction, its fuel expendi tures increased from $164,040 in 2007 to $196,640 in 2008. $230,300 has been budgeted for fuel in 2009. Where it can, BPD is working to use vehicles that consume less energy. The Department has added a few motorcycles, they've purchased a few electric Segways for downtown and trail patrol, and they employ bi cycle and foot patrols where ap propriate. The Department purchased a hybrid vehicle for its school liaison officer and h as begun shutting down engines when vehicles are not being driven. Bloomington police Lt. Jimmy Ratcliff stands on a Segway along the B\u00adLine Trail. Property of the Herald\u00adTimes, David Snodgress. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 65 FIRE DEPARTMENT The City's Fire Department provides fire suppression, emergency medical services, and rescue services for vehicle acci dents and other rescue needs. The Department provides community protection at all times. The Department employs 107 fullti me firefighters and maintains five fire stations. It has 23 vehicles of which six are fire trucks. The Fire Department's six pumpers , two aerial trucks, one brush truck, one confined space truck, and three rescue trucks all run on B20 biodiesel. The Department's ten remaining vehicles are used for administrative purposes and run on gasoline. In 2008, the Department made approximately 3,300 runs. Approximately 37% of those were for rescue or emergency medical services. At minimum, the department estimates that it needs a minimum of 22,000 gallons of biodiesel to provide services. VULNERABILIES 1. The Police Department relies on the availability of gasoline to keep our community safe and is significantly exposed to cost increases. As one of the most fuelconsumpt ive departments, the Police Dep artment is perhaps one of the most vulnerable to a decline in cheap oil. At the present moment, the Department would not be able to fulfill its duties without gasoline. 2. The Fire Department relies on B20 biodiesel and is largely exposed to cost increases. B20 is a fuel blend composed of 20% biodiesel and 80% petroleum diesel. 99 99 National Biodiesel Board, Biodiesel Basics, http://www.biodiesel.org/res ources/biodiesel_basics/ . Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 663. There is a potential for increased social problems resulting from peak oil and economic dislocation. The recent experience with escal ating gas prices, the attendant increase in food prices, the mortgage crisis, and the recession have put great pressure on our community's residents as well as social service providers. As explained in the Economic Context chapter, it is anticipated that our current per iod of economic distress will l ast for some time. It is well documented that, in times of eco nomic hardship, illegal activit y and violence tend to increase.100 Observers point out that every recession since the late 1950s has been marked by an increase in crime, particu larly property crime and robber y.101 The Police Executive Research Forum recently conducte d a survey of 233 police agencies and found that 44 percent reported a rise in certain types of crime attributed to the current economic climate. The study also found that 63 percent of departments were making plans for overall cuts in their funding for the next fiscal year. 102 Peak oil, exacerbated by the cu rrent economic climate, translat es into more economic dislocation. It is likely that some citizens, out of both frus tration and despair, will look for extralegal ways to sustain themselves. 103 This will put increased pressure on the Police Department to keep the city safe and on the Fire Department to provide emergency medical treatment. If social services are increasingly strained or otherwise compromised, police may be called upon to fulfill this role as well. 100 Alfred Blumstein and Richard Rosenfeld, \"Factors Contributing to U.S. Crime Trends,\" Understanding Crime Trends: Workshop Report, Goldberger and Rosenfeld, eds, 1344 (National Academies Press: Washington, D.C, 2008).

Peak oil will likely present additional fire safety concerns. It is likely that as oil becomes more and more expensive, some residents might try to hoard gasoline - a practice that prese nts serious safety risks. It i s also expected that, as electricity and gas become more expensive, more residents will turn to heat ing their homes with wood and biomass. Gasoline hoarding and heating with biomass w ill call for more fire suppression and will require the Fire Department to engage in even more firesafety community awareness efforts. MITIGATION GOALS & STRATEGIES SHORT\u00ad TERM (1\u00ad5 years) 1. Priority should be granted to Police and Fire in adding new staff to the City. 2. The City should develop a fuel allocation plan wherein, in the event of a fuel shortage, the Police and Fire Departments are given greatest priority . 3. The City should plan for shortages and supply disruptions and transition back\u00adup generators away from diesel fuel. 4. Anticipating a period of growing social problems, the Police Department should work with Neighborhood Associations to develop neighborhood patrols. 5. The Police Department should continue to invest in bicycles, neighborhood electric vehicles, etc. and should consider the use of horse patrols where appropriate. 6. Anticipating more fuel hoarding and non\u00ad conventional home heating practices, the Fire Department should provide community outreach on the dangers of hoarding and how to practice safe home heating using biomass. 7. The Fire Department should investigate to what extent the fire trucks could be retrofitted to run on B100. B100 holds the possibility of fueling fire trucks by use of locally\u00adderived lipids such as restaurant grease.104 104 The National Biodiesel Board adv ises that \"high percent blends can impact fuel system components (primarily fuel hoses and fuel pump seals) that contain compoun ds incompatible with B100. Manufacturers recommend that natural or butyl r ubbers not be a llowed to come in contact with pure biodiesel or biodiesel blends higher than B20. Over the past 15 years of use, blends of B20 or lower have not exhibited problematic Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 68MEDIUM \u00adTERM (5\u00ad15 years) 1. The Police Department should consider ways in which it might transition pursuit vehicles away from fossil fuel reliance. Most patrol cars used by the City are Ford Crown Victoria model s. The City should explore pursuit cars that are not reliant on fossil fuels. While we've described why biodiesel is not a remedy for the advent of peak oi l, we will have to look toward interim remedies that help us bridge the gap to energy independence. The BPD could reduce its reliance on petroleum by shifting in the shortterm to a biodiesel pursuit vehicle. For example, Carbon Motors offers a fullspec pursuit car that can run on biodiesel. 2. The Police Department should replace a number of patrol cars with electric cars. There are few locations in the city where a highspeed chase is likely to occur. As part of the shift away from car culture, streets could be made unsafe f or vehicular traffic above a certain speed (for example, 35 mi lesperhour). Traffic calming, narrower roads, more pedestrianfriendly roads, and a denser settlement pattern will make automotive hijinks rather difficult and far less li kely. Small electric patrol ve hicles might be adequate when combined with a few big cruisers and coordination with the Monr oe County Sheriff's Department. 3. Provide additional first responders and EMTs. As most of the Fire Department's calls are for medical events, it may be prudent to add more first responders and EMTs s taff and to purchase an energy efficient dualuse fire/EMT vehicle that runs on bio diesel or another nonfossil f uel. elastomer degradation and no changes are recommended. If a fuel system does contain these materials and users wish to fuel with blends o ver B20, replacement with compa tible elastomers Above B20, http://www.biodiesel.org/pdf_files/Biodiesel_Blends_Above%20_20 _Final.pdf . Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 69LONG\u00adTERM (15\u00ad30 years) 1. Implement neighborhood police stations rather than one, centralized station. Neighborhood police stations hav e the potential not only to dec rease the response time for emergency and nonemergency calls, but also would enable local residents to become more involved. Cities where neighborhoodsited police stations have been successfully implemented include Oakland, Chicago, and Boston.105 2. Electric fire engines are still largely in development. However, as they are perfected and become affordable, the City should explore this option. 105 For example, with Chicago's CAPS (Chicago's Alternative Policin g Strategy) the entire Police Department is being decentralized to the neighborhood level. See, City of Chicago's CAPS. See further, CAPS at Ten: Community Policing in Chicago \u00ad An Evaluation of Chicago's Alternative Policing Strategy, a tenyear evaluation of the program. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 70OTHER EMERGENCY SERVICES Nonroutine emergency services are provided by the Monroe Count y Emergency Management Agency (MCEMA). As required by State statute, the Ag ency is charged with establishing and maintaining \"a progressive emergency managemen t program that promotes the mitigation of, preparation for, the response to an d recovery from emergencies and disasters impacting the public, government, and business of the communities of Monroe County.\" T his program is mapped out in th e Monroe County Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan.106 As spelled out in its \"Situatio n and Assumptions\" section, the Plan anticipates the following hazards: floods, winter storms, tornadoes, earthquakes, terrori sm, and hazardous materials releases on transportation corridors or at a facility.107 These are the hazards anticipated in emergency planning, which assumes: The event will be localized, so that the community can rely on outside assistance within a relatively short amount of time; and That the goal is to minimize dam age and maximize recoverability to pre\u00ad disaster conditions as quickly as possible. VULNERABILITY With a decline in cheap oil, there will not be a tidy return to \"predisaster\" conditions. Because our reliance on petroleum is systemic, planning for peak oil is planning for a long emergency .108 Reliance on fossil fuel for bac kup generators for vital comm unications and other functions would be a long term vulnerability. The County Emergency Management Agency should plan for supply interruptions and shortages. 106 Monroe County Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan, Basic Plan, (2003). 107 Ibid, 4. 108 The term \"long emergency\" is borrowed from the book by James K unstler, The Long Emergency: Surviving the Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty\u00adfirst Century (Grove/Atlantic, 2005). The book explores the effects of peak oil on society. The book points out that a postpeak w orld will force us all to l ive in more localized, selfsufficient communities. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 71MITIGATION GOAL SHORT\u00ad TERM (1\u00ad5 years) 1. Plan for the Long Emergency We suggest that MCEMA integrate planning for peak oil into its plan to ensure that power and fuel required for maintainin g services is available without the expectation of outside assistance. In the long emergency, mitigation, response, and re covery should be powered by local renewable sources. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 72 FLEET & STREET: CARBON WEBS & ASPHALT CONNECTIONS The City's reliance on petroleum is most immediately apparent i n the operation of its fleet and the paving and maintenance of its streets. The City's Fleet and Street Divisions have implemented laudable conservatio n and efficiency improvements to reduce reliance on petroleum. However, peak oil means that the provision of these services will become increasingly expensive. Congruen t with the City's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, peak oil provides the City with the opportunity to t hink through new ways to provide for safe streets and an efficient fleet while reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. THE MUNCIPAL FLEET The City's fleet is composed of 466 vehicles and equipment: 235 unleaded vehicles 109(including four hybrids), 115 dies el vehicles and one electric GEM car used by the City's Downtown Specialist. It owns 85 pieces of diesel equipment, 20 pieces of equipment using unleaded fuel, 5 electric and 5 propane pieces.110 Since 2005, the City has abided by a biodieselonly purcha sing policy for its 200 diesel powered cars and equipment. The City uses these vehicles for police and fire protection; for enforcement of the Bloomington Municipal Code (parking enforcement, zoning compliance, housing and neighborhood inspection); for maintaining parks, trails, the golf course, and other recreational facilities and programs; for street and sidewalk repair and maintenance; and for taking care of the city's water and wastewater needs. 109 City Fleet advises that only 25 cars are flexfuel capable; th e rest of the fleet cannot be \"retrofitted\" for flexfuel capacity. 110 The following numbers reflect a ll vehicles and fuelpowered eq uipment attributed to each department: Police (45), Public Works (6), E ngineering (11), Housing & Neig hborhood Development (9), Parking Enforcement (4), Planning (2), Ri sk Management (2), Traffic (9) , Fire (23), Fleet Mainten ance (5), Street (96), Utilities (169), Parks and Recreation (85), the Animal Shelter (3), Sanitation (17), and Information & Technology Services (2). The City's all\u00adelectric GEM carReport of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 73 The City owns a total of six fuel tanks: three unleaded tanks that have a capacity of 10,000 gallons each and three diesel tan ks - two with a capacity of 1 0,000 gallons each and one with a capacity of 2,000 gallons. As these tanks can only be fi lled to 90% capacity, the City has storage capacity for approx imately 27,000 gallons of unlead ed fuel and 19,800 of diesel fuel. Fleet purchases an average of 8,500 gallons of unleaded fuel and 7,500 gallons of biodiesel each month. The City ha s contracts with three providers for unleaded fuel and two providers for biodiesel. In the event of a fuel shortage, the City is considered a \"priority customer\" and would receive first opportunity to claim fuel. Over the last number of years, the City has experienced an appreciable increase in the cost of fuel even though the gallons c onsumed have variously decreas ed or remained constant. From 2003 to 2008, the unleaded fuel costs to the City increased 130% while the cost of diesel increased 177%. 111 Year Unleaded Gallons Purchased Unleaded Cost Diesel Gallons Purchased Diesel Cost 2003 169,974 result of the oil spike of summer 2008, the amount budgete d for fuel in 2009 increased by almost 20%, from $679,091 to $810,791. Meanwhile, the perce ntage of the overall City budget claimed by fuel has doubl ed over the last six years: in 2003, fuel constituted 0.63% of the entire City budget; in 2009 fuel comprises 1.32% of the budget. 111 In 2005 the City began buying only biodiesel to power its dies el vehicles and equipment. Note that Fleet does not currently track the tot al number of miles driven. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 74In an effort to save money, redu ce reliance on petroleum and to reduce the City's carbon emissions, many City departments have already implemented some forwardthinking measures to reduce the City's re liance on liquid fuels. For example, the City has purchased four hybrid cars and one electri c car, all departments have imp lemented \"no idle\" policies, suppliers travel to the City for restocking, most enforcement departments have greatly consolidated their trips (now most inspection is based on locat ion rather than inspecting a complaint as soon as it is lodged), departments encourage carpo oling, the acreage of turf mowed in City parks has been red uced, experiments with \"lowmow \" or \"nomow\" grasses have been conducted, and energye fficient maintenance equipment has been purchased. Importantly, the City has established an internal working group , Team Process, to audit the current fleet and develop a v ehicle replacement plan. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 75VULNERABILITIES While the City staff has taken impressive measures to reduce th e City's consumption of oil, the City of Bloomington is just a s vulnerable to a decline in c heap oil as its residents. 1. Without mitigation, increased costs to operate City vehicles could throw the City into a deficit and would require it to reduce its services. When each department was asked how it would respond if required to cut its fuel usage by 50%, all departments indicated th at, without mitigation, a 50% reduction in fuel use would translate into substantial reduction in services. 2. Vehicle maintenance would be compromised in the interest of emergency \u00adonly repairs . 3. For Code enforcement operations, the City can anticipate a loss of revenue . From 20062008, the City received an average of $1,050,774 in f ines per year. The bulk of these fines derive from the enforcement of the City's parking r ules: in this time frame, the City received an average of $827, 500 from the payment of parkin g tickets alone. As the enforcement of parking rules bec omes more expensive and as resi dents increasingly are unable to drive nearly as much, the City will likely experience a marked decrease in this source of revenue. 4. The City currently employs 692 full\u00adtime employees and 200 temporary employees. Sustained and serious fuel shortages or price increases will impact the availability of commuting employees. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 76MITIGATION GOALS & STRATEGIES SHORT\u00ad TERM STRATEGIES (1\u00ad5 years) 1. Establish an emergency fuel reserve to prepare for a fuel shortage. The City should shift its practices to maintain an emergency re serve of fuel (beyond that which it already maintains for d aily use) in the event of a shortage and/or drastic price increase. 2. Establish a measurable goal for reducing total vehicle miles driven. Toward that end, the City should start tracking total miles dri ven on each vehicle. 3. Encourage Team Process to develop a plan for a Model City Green Fleet . As the City's Team Process examines and audits the curre nt City fleet and prioritizes acquisition, it should do so wit h an eye to discerning which ve hicles might be eliminated and how we might maximize fuel e fficiency in the short term. I n the long term, the City should transition its fleet away from reliance on fossil fuels. Some ideas Team Process might pursue include: reducing the size of the City fleet throu gh partnerships with car sharing groups (this might be a consortium of City, County, the schools, and IU) and requiring bestinclass purchases, with priority given to electric and plugin hybrid electric vehicles as appropriate 4. Encourage use of more bicycles, Segways, motorized bikes, and electric cars in code enforcement, where feasible. 5. Establish a City bicycle fleet Institute a City bicycle fleet so that City employees have the option to ride a City bicycle rather than drive a City vehicle. Currently, the City's Parkin g Enforcement Division owns two bicycles for use by two of i ts nine enforcement officers. Each employee using such a program would likely have to hav e her/his own helmet. While li ability concerns may arise from such a proposal, it should be noted both that employees al ready often walk or ride their own bikes for City business where appropriate and that ma ny other municipalities Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 77successfully maintain a bicycle fleet for employees and have ad dressed liability concerns.112 Establishing a City bicycle fleet would help the City prepare f or peak oil while reducing the community's greenhouse gas emiss ion and improving employee well ness. 6. Direct departments to develop fuel\u00adreduction implementation plans. All City departments are already engaging in laudable efforts to reduce their reliance on oil; however, we can do more. All City departments should outline a plan to achieve a 50% reduction in petroleum consumption by 2024. 7. Carpooling incentives. While the City has established a n electronic carpooling \"match\" system, to date it appears to be only very lightly used, if at all. The City should establ ish some sort of reward for those who choose to carpool, e.g, gas cards, bonuses for three or mor e employees in one car, free oil changes, etc. 8. Pay for parking. Currently, City employees pay $2 for an annual parking permit. The City should explore a sliding scale permit system under which higher wage earners pay more to park. This should be a progressive measure, not one that burdens lowearni ng employees. Money collected from this program could be used to pay for the carpooling incentives mentioned above or for other employee rewards for sustainable practices. 9. The City should implement one \u00adday\u00ada\u00adweek telecommuting options for non\u00ad manual work employees where appropriate. As discussed in the Transportation chapter, a lmost half of Bloomington workers reported spending between 10 and 19 minute s getting to work daily. Between 1990 and 2000, the portion of workers with commutes less than 10 minutes declined by 4%. Excluding 112 Examples of municipally-owned bicy cle fleets include: San Francisco, CA; Berkeley, AZ; Houston, TX; Louisville, KY; and Minneapolis, MN. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 78residents who work from home, ho wever, this group declined by 6 %. Meanwhile, the portion of workers with commutes between 20 to 44 minutes incre ased by 10%.113 The City should seriously examin e a telecommuting policy wherei n employees are encouraged to work from home once a week, if appropriate to the ir duties. A number of municipalities have already implemented such policies.114 Not only does such a policy reduce the City's reliance on petroleum to get employees to work, but it also decreases the City's electricity consumption and reduces greenhouse gas emiss ions while improving employee morale and retention.115 10. The City should explore a four\u00adday work week. Both the City's Sanitation Divis ion and the Monroe County Highway Department have moved to fourday work weeks in a n effort to save fuel. The Ci ty should identify positions for which such a configuration m ight make sense. If paired with some form of telecommuting, this promises to substantially reduce employee d rive time. 11. Seek assistance with park maintenance from volunteers, neighborhood associations, etc. This would reduce the number of vehicles travelling to parks to mow and maintain facilities. The City might begin such an initiative with a few Adopt\u00ad a\u00adPark trial runs to assess how such volunteer pro visioning would best work. 113 2000 US Census. 114 Examples include San Francisco, San Diego, Portland, OR; Atlan ta; Virginia Beach, VA; and Denver, CO. Indeed, US cities have experienced high g rowth in rates of telecommutin g to work from 2006 to 2007, most likely a direct impact from rising fuel prices. Oakland had the highest telecommuting rate, at 7.6 % in 2007, while six US cities\u2014San Francisco, San Diego, Portland, OR; Atlanta; Virgini a Beach and Denverhad more than 5% of their total workforce being primarily home based.

Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 79MEDIUM \u00adTERM GOALS & STRATEGIES (5\u00ad15 years) 1. Reduce the size of the City fleet by at least 25% though partnerships with car\u00ad sharing groups. Many communities have successfully implemented such programs. For example, the City of Philadelphia has a municipal fle et of approximately 6,000 vehic les and joined with the PhillyCarShare116, the community's nonprofit car sharing service in 2004.117 This was the first system worldwide in which government employees and local resident shared vehicles by the hour in a major effort to reduce the number of vehicles in the community. Within the space of four years, the project helped the City of Philadelphi a eliminate 330 vehicles and save taxpayers almost $2 m illion annually. See the Transportation chapter for more details on car sharing. 2. Implement a pilot Grease\u00adto\u00adBiofuel Program whereby the City offers local restaurants free vegetable oil collection for processing into biodiesel to fuel the City fleet. Communities such as San Francisco118 and Seattle have started to leverage restaurant grease to fuel municipal vehicle s as concern over the environme ntal harm of soy biodiesel mounts.119 As discussed elsewhere, this wo uld divert harmful fats, oil, and grease away from the City's sewer system. LONG\u00adTERM GOAL (15\u00ad30 years) 1. Realize a Model City Fleet. All City vehicles, especially eme rgency vehicles, should be transitioned away from fossil fuel reliance. http://www.phillycarshare.org/ . 117 http://www.mayorsinnova tion.org/pdf/Philade lphiaFleetManagement .pdf; The it as a 2006 finalist for Harvard's Innovations in Government Award http://www.innovati ons.harvard.edu/awards.html?id=15709 118 San Francisco's initiative can be found here: http://www.sfgreasecycle.org/thedish.shtml . Converting grease into biofuel requires som e processing including filtering, settling and decanting. If the City led the way in creating a demand for such pr oduct, it could help foster a w hole new local green industry. 119 In May 2009, Seattle mayor Greg Nickels directed the Seattle F leet department to stop buying soy biodiesel after the EPA issued a report stating that ethanol production w as potentially worse for the environment than gasoline.

Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 80MAINTAINING CITY STREETS Everything we do relies on oil.120 - Bobby Chestnut, Street Commissio ner, City of Bloomington Stre et Division The City's Street Division provides maintenance and repair for Bloomington's 237 miles of streets. Its functions primarily include: street resurfacing, t he repair and construction of sidewalks and curbs, snow removal, street sweeping, and leaf collection. In 2006, the City paved 2.5 million square feet of streets; in 2007, it paved 1.5 million square feet and in 2008, it paved 906,710. In 2009, it is scheduled to pave a lit tle over 1 million square feet. The Street Division has used a p etroleumbased asphalt for the last 35 years. This is a product with a life span of 34 years. The City repaves accordi ng to a plan that calls for paving all arterial streets every ten years, all collector stre ets every 12 years, and all local streets every 20 years. The price of asphalt is closely connected to the price of oil. Asphalt paving materials consist of a mix of aggregate (stone), s and or gravel and crude refined bitumen, also called \"liquid asphalt.\" Liquid asphalt is a sticky black residual obtained fr om the refining of crude oil and acts as the binding agent for as phalt. Since liquid asphalt is a residual from crude oil refining, as oil prices rise, li quid asphalt prices increase. A ccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the price of liquid asphalt has increased 250% duri ng the past five years. This price increase has led to a doub ling of total asphalt paving co sts. 121 120 Boyd, James, \"Police Agencies C utting Gas Use a Prices Rise Bl oomington Police, Monroe Sheriff's Office Finding Ways to Save,\" Bloomington Herald Times, May 28, 2008. 121 http://www.bls.gov/ Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 81 The City has been adversely affected by this marked upswing in asphalt prices. In 2006 the City paid $27.90/ton; in 2007, $33.65/ton; in 2008, $32.15/ton; and in 2009, $48.25/ton. 122 In 2008, the Street Division used 20,000 tons of asphalt. Bloomington has one asphalt plant. The Street Division has worked to extend the life of existing roads and mitigate the need for repaving b y using an asphalt compound sealant. The sealant extends the life of the road by 35 years . VULNERABILITY While the Street Division has ma de impressive efforts to reduce its consumption of asphalt by recycling the asphalt on projects where the City mills exist ing road, the Division is nevertheless very exposed to volatile and increasing asphalt prices. MITIGATION GOALS & STRATEGIES SHORT TERM (1\u00ad5 Years) 1. Explore mixes that require less energy to produce, can use a greater percentage of recycled asphalt and are longer lived. 2. Explore the use of bioasphalt made from bitumen and other non\u00adpetroleum based paving materials such as Road Oyl, a bio\u00adbased binder that is an emulsion of half water and half pine resin and pitch . 123 3. Explore the use of brick or stone pavement, where appropriate. 4. Instead of a paving plan whereby every inch of every street is repaved within 10, 15, or 20 years, prioritize major arterials and tend to others on an \"as needed\" basis. As private automobile traffic dissipates, it is unlikely that such an aggressive repaving plan will be necessary. 122 Asphalt is bid out at the beginning of the year for that year' s paving season. 123 http://www.gtkp.com/upl oads/public/document s/Knowledge/Ecoroad %20Technologies%20Review a.pdf; http://www.sspco.org/naturalp avexl/naturalpave_OV.html Report Peak Oil Task Force 82MEDIUM TERM (5\u00ad15 Years) 1. Reduce road width where appropriate (See Transportation chapter). LONG TERM (15\u00ad30 Years) 1. Low\u00aduse roads might safely be transitioned to gravel, dirt, or other non\u00ad fossil fuel materials. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 83CITY BUILDINGS VULNERABILITY Buildings account for 72 percent of all electricity consumption and 39 percent of all energy consumption.124 This Report has already discussed the grid' s age and its reliance on oil. The City has done much to make its b uildings more efficient - upgra ding the HVAC system in City Hall to use 15% less energy, installing LED traffic lights , installing lowflow sensored water faucets, and passing the C ity's Green Building Ordinance. All these efforts are vital to reducing the City's reliance on the grid, but we can do even mo re. MITIGATION GOALS & STRATEGIES SHORT TERM (1\u00ad5 Years) 1. All back\u00adup generators for all City buildings should be transitioned away from diesel fossil fuel reliance, with the Police and Fire Departments to receive priority. 2. Implement the Green Building Ordinance with a focus on energy\u00adsaving, passive measures. In early 2009, the City passed a longawaited Green Building Or dinance requiring that all new construction and major renovation of occupiable City buildi ngs be designed, contracted and built to achieve, at minimum, the U.S. Green Bui lding Council's LEED\u00ae Silver level of certification. The ordi nance also calls for retrofitti ng existing buildings where said building can meet a 10year payback period. This is an important start to fostering sustainable building standards. H owever, LEED standards do not always address peak oil concerns, as many of the LEED fea tures are not particularly relevant to a building's energy use. 124 U.S. Green Building Council, Green Building Research, http://www.usgbc.org/Displa yPage.aspx?CMSPageID=1718 Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 84As summarized by Pat Murphy in Plan C: [P]lacing a bike rack near the building earns one point, which is the same value earned if 5% of the building's energy comes from renewabl e sources. Likewise, installing a metal gra te at the entrance to reduce particle count earns one point while increasing energy efficiency, which might cost tens of thousands of dollars, only earns two points.125 In implementing its Green Building Ordinance, the City should p rioritize energysaving measures, particularly passive measures (those that require no ongoing energy use). These include insulation, efficient windows, weather stripping, natural ventila tion, passive solar, and the planting of decid uous foliage on the south and w est sides of buildings. Such measures not only save energy an d money, but continue to work e ven in the event of power outages or rolling black and brownouts. 125 Murphy, Pat. Plan C: Community Survival Strategies for Peak Oil and Climate Change (New Society Publishers: Gabriola Island, Canada, 2008). Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 85CITY REVENUE As has been documented elsewhere in this Report, high gas prices have translated into reduced demand. With demand destruction comes lower gasoline t ax revenue. Indiana is one of eight states with a gas t ax in addition to the federal g as tax.126 Revenue from the gas tax, vehicle registration fees, and other sources are pooled an d distributed to state entities for maintenance and construction of highways and to local entit ies for maintenance of roads and streets. Like other Indiana communities, Bloomington experienced a stead y decline in revenue from these pooled \"gas tax\" sources from 20042008. In 2004, the City received $2,774,033 from these sources - approximately 5.92% of City rev enue. In 2008, funds from these sources totaled 2,481,648 (4.49% of total revenue) - a de crease in highway and gas sourced funds of approximately $292,000. VULNERABILITIES When the price of gasoline begin s to rise again, we can expect a further decrease in demand. As demand decreases, we expect that this revenue source will continue to shrink. Fuel prices will also influence t he ability of the City to asse ss fines. Approximately 2 percent of the City's budget relies on fines and forfeitures. As discussed above, the bulk of these fines result from violations of the City's parking rules. In 2008, parking citations accounted for $749,592.32 of the $1,068,000 in fines and forfei tures. As gas prices rise and community members increasingly walk, bike, or take public t ransit, it is anticipated that parking enforcement revenue will decrease appreciably. Si milarly, insofar as staff is limited to foot or bicycle enforc ement of all of its ordinances , it is expected that fines will decrease across the board. 126 Currently, Indiana's gas tax stands at 29.2 cents/gallon. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 86MITIGATION GOALS & STRATEGIES SHORT TERM (1\u00ad5 Years) 1. The City should consider the anticipated loss of \"gasoline tax\" and \"fine and forfeiture\" revenue in its budgeting process. 2. City should add energy vulnerability scenarios to its departmental budgeting process. 3. The City should set aside added reserves in a dedicated Energy Transition and Community Sustainability Fund to assist with funding necessary infrastructure and technology transition to cover increasing energy costs and increased investment in emergency and social services. To help build this reserve, the City should use price \"lows\" wisely by using current and any future price reductions (which will likely only be temporary) to redirect already budgeted higher fu el expenses into a special emergency fund (See Transportation chapter). Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 87 THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT Energy consumption and the built environment are closely linked. Energy use shapes the way our communities are laid out, how we get from one place to another, and how we build our homes. In the U.S., the ubiq uity of the personal automobile has reshaped our everyday lives such that we can live a co nsiderable distance from work, the grocery store, the hardware store, and other necessi ties of life. Similarly, cheap energy has shaped the form and function of our homes: in general, we tend to live in house s that are too big and pretty inefficient. This section examines peak oil and the built envir onment through three lenses: land use, transportation, and housing. A decline in cheap oil will require that we rethink how we use our land, how we get from one place to another, and how we use energy in our homes. However, a resilient buil t environment promises to save both energy and money while enhancing individual and collective quality of life. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 88LAND USE The cities will be part of the country; I shall live 30 miles from my office in one direction, under a pine tree; my secretary will live 30 miles away from it too, in the other direction, under another pine tree. We shall both have our own car. We shall use up tires, wear out road surfaces and gears, consume oil and gasoline. All of which will necessitate a great deal of work ... enough for all. Le Corbusier, The Radiant City (1967) The Human Scale Historically, our communities have been shaped by the mode of t ravel available to us. While horse, rail, and the street car allowed us to go further and faster than ever before, for most of human history we have lived our lives on a scale that w as within walking distance. That is, we were able to meet our needs of daily life by walking to the grocery, to work, the hardware store, school, and othe r activities. This ambit where in we meet most of our essential daily needs can be und erstood as the \"human scale.\" The Automotive Age The human scale was completely r edefined with the advent of the personal automobile. Thanks to technological advances, the personal auto became much more commonplace after WWII. After the war, just about everyone owned a car. A s the personal auto became the norm, it dramatically reconfigured the geographic space we could traverse in a day: people could easily live in one place, work in another, while shopping, schooling, and conducting all of the other aspects of daily life in equally di stant places.127 In turn, the everincreasing distances between home and the rest of life rad ically reshaped land use patterns. 127 Real-estate interests reacted quickly an d predictably, introducing the legal concept of zoning in order to place legal restrictions on what land use activities were allowed or prohibited. Originally sold to the public on the basis that these rules were a way to ensure that no slaughterhouse, refinery, factory, or prisons would, or could, be built in their residential neighborhoods, zoning became a powerful tool by which developers could guarantee infrastructure investments in their parcels while simultaneously vastly increasing the demand for land, thereby driving up its price. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 89 Spatial & Economic Dispersion The result was the unprecedented spatial expansion of the typical community and a vast increase of the human scale. Ove r time, as suburbs exploded ar ound city cores, they drained those cores of residents . Inner cities became little more than employment centers or depressed quarters for those unable, financially, to escape them. Meanwhile, the suburbs developed a new, and heretofore unique, arrangement whereby zoning forced land use into specialized pods such as residential, employment, or retail. These pods were separated by large distances and connected to each other via highways and arterial roads. The city's dense and redundant web of street grids gave way to the suburbs' sparse set of connectors. The automobileenabled diaspora's effects are felt most acutely by lowerincome earners. Without access to lowcost transportation, such as pe destrian travel or public transit, lowerincome workers are forced to either take on the expense of automotive ownership ($5,000 a year for an average automobile 128) or restrict their employment opportunities. Because lowerinc ome workers are more likely to own older and less fuel efficient vehicles, the effects of fuel prices are particularly problematic for these workers. If a worker must make a twenty mile roundtrip commute from her pl ace of residence to her place of employment and her vehicle averages twenty miles per g allon, then paying for gasoline alone will consume a si gnificant portion of her income . At $5,000 a year for vehicle ownership, a laborer working a typical 2,000 hours/year must earn $2.50 an hour 128 According to the American Automobile Association. Source: http://planning.city.cleveland.oh.us/cwp/landuse.htmReport of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 90 just to cover the cost of vehicle maintenance, or 35 percent of the new minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.129 In areas of the community developed prior to WWII, much of the infrastructure remains at a pedestrian human scale. Stree ts are narrow, sidewalks are wa lkable, and the distances to amenities and employment can be relatively short. Unfortunately , this is not true in newer areas. Macrolevel changes in the community have stripped older neighborhoods of their inherent selfreliance. The school consolidation craze of the 1960s onwards has largely rendered the concept of the neighborhood school moot. In 1967, prior to consolidation, there were 23 elementary schools in Monroe County (0.38 per capita of total elementary student school population). 130 Today there are 16 elementary s chools (0.25 per capita of tot al elementary school population)131 and only 9% of elementary stude nts travel to school by foot.132 Likewise the neighborhood grocery has given over to the superma rket, and everything from hardware supplies to pharmac ies has decamped from the olde r neighborhoods to the shopping centers and strip malls on the community's periphery. 129 The new minimum wage was effective July 24, 2009. 130 Based on 1960 US Census data. 131 Based on 2000 US Censu s data. Total elemen tary school population in 1967 estimated to be 6,028; total elementary school population betw een both Monroe County School Corporation (MCCSC) and RichlandBean Blossom School Corporation(RBB) is 6,518. 132 This figure only reflects eleme ntary students within the MCCSC ; it does not include students in the more rural RBB. Furthermore, the nu mber reflects students who live within \"nontransported boundaries\" (1.5 miles) of the school. In 20082009 , approximately 5,138 element ary students were enrolled in MCCSC; 493 of these students lived within non transported boundaries of the s chool. It is assumed that some students walk and bike, but that parents drive some of these students to scho ol. The McCalla Elementary School on E. 9th was decommissioned as part of school consolidation in 1967 Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 91 Relocalization If the emergence of the personal automobile transformed the bui lt environment into the shape we know today, then what effect will a decline in personal automobile use have on the built environment? It will be, in a word, relocalization. Instead of dispersed settlement patterns and concentrated pockets of commerce, neighborhoods will once again become areas of community wherein most residents are able to meet their everyday needs by walking, biking, or taking public transit. As one observer puts it, \"[t]he End of Suburbia coul d become the End of the Commute rather than the death of a neighborhood.\" 133 However, relocalizing the community will require us to rethin k our built environment. 133 Pat Murphy, Plan C: Community Survival Strategies for Peak Oil and Climate Change (Gabriola Island, BC: New Society Publishers, 2008), 251. Downtown Bloomington Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 92 REVIEW OF THE CURRENT SITUATION: PAVING THE WAY Road Infrastructure and its Influence on Development The growth of an expansive road network has had a transformative eff ect on Bloomington's built environment for the past two decades. An aphorism attributed to industrial designer Norman Bel Geddes, who designed General Motor's Futurama exhibit for the 1931 World's Fair, stated \"the highway should not impress upon the city, nor should the city impress upon the highway.\" The traditional practice of running connect ing pikes and roads through the centers of the communities they connected was deemed to be no longer appropriate because most highway traffic would not be expected to be destin ed for the communities through which the highway ran. It was expected to be bypass traffic which, if routed through the community, would only add to congestion and not commerce. Therefore, it was thought best to allow it to pass by communities rather than through them. Bloomington was not immune from th is bypass logic. State Road 3 7 used to come through Bloomington by way of Cascades Pa rk. The park was a Depression era project of considerable civic utility. Co mmunity leaders at the time beli eved that the experience of entering (or leaving) Bloomington would be greatly enhanced if the road wound through a park - as it still does. However, by the 1960s Bel Geddes' sent iment had deeply pervaded the highway engineering mindset and, when calls were made to help deal with the \"congestion\" on State Road 37, i t was natural to look at bypass ing the city as one part of a comprehensive solution. By th e early 1970s the road had been d ivided, fourlaned, and now took a route not through the city, but far off to its west side, through an almost entirely rural landscape. The SR 37/SR 46 \"Exchange\" constructed in anticipation of building a new terrain highway through much of Southern Indiana's farmland and greenspace in the interest of incr eased commodity transport by truck. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 93Simultaneously, the State of Indiana wished to increase opportu nities for tourism and economic development around the recentlycompleted Lake Monroe. Large numbers of daytrippers from the communities to Bloomington's north, espec ially Indianapolis, were expected to use the lake for summertime recreation, and prepara tions for traffic management were made. These pre parations included the provision of a second bypass around the city, connecting Stat e Road 37 on the city's north to a new highway down to the lake outside the eastern edge of the city. Neither bypass remained rural for very long. The first to sprout was the \"College Mall\" area, established on for merly agricultural land in 1965 and connected to the city both by the new eastern bypass a s well as by a widened Third Street. Immediately, the C ollege Mall began to draw econ omic activity away from the city's downtown which entered a long, but not particularly sharp decline cushioned by the presence of Indiana University's urban campus. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 94 College Mall Area - 1949 College Mall Area - 1961 College Mall \u00ad\u00ad 1967 College Mall \u00ad\u00ad 1972 The Machine in the Garden The First Sprout: College Mall Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 95In the late 1980s, commercial acti vity began along the State Road 37 bypass to the west of the city as well as the area betw een Second Street/Bloomfield R oad. Third Street/Whitehall Pike was developed into a major retail destination for resident s of both Bloomington and the surrounding countie s. The result, as our Activity Nodes map (Map A) shows, is the development of the community into one consisting of three primary areas of activity. One is centered around Bloomingt on's downtown core (central node), biased towards the university's western edge. Another is centered on the College Mall area (eastern node) while the third is centered at the nexus of State Road 37 and T hird Street/Whitehall Pike (western node). Significant sec ondary and tertiary developments are also present at both the eastern and western nodes, such as the Ivy Tech/Cook Campus development farther west and both the new retail cen ters north of Third Street at College Mall and the significant residential developments (including Renwick) along Sare Road. Developments within those three nodes have come at the expense of Bloomington's neighborhoods, particularly the newer neighborhoods. In genera l, the newer the neighborhood the less access it h as to essential amenities (suc h as grocery stores, retail shopping, pharmacies, schools, e tc.) and the more dependent it is on the automobile to reach those amenities. Consequently, the newer a neighborhood the more likely it is to be vulnerable to fuel prices and fuel disruptions. This is both because newer neighborhoods tend to be developed farther fro m the city core or either of th e western or eastern activity nodes and because newer neighbor hoods are developed almost excl usively for residential use (although some of the very newest developments are beginnin g to include retail and employment functions within them again). Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 96About the Activity Nodes Project In a postpeak world, it will be important for people to live c lose to services critical to everyday life. In an effort to un derstand just how close or far residents currently live from key services, the Task Force mapped those services and compared the location of key services (areas of \"activity nod es\") against a map of populatio n density. The following Activity Nodes map tracks the location of nine key services and the density o f these services within a 300foot by 300foot block: grocery st ores, schools, pharmacies, post offices, public libraries, re staurants, hardware stores, d epartment stores and farmers' markets. The areas of the city with the highest concentration of these services (seven or more) are noted in bright pink; those with five to six locations are marked in red; those with four and three destinations are marked in dark and light o range respectively while those with one or two locations are indicated by yellow. While the current picture of acti vity nodes points to three dis tinct nodes, an ideal configuration would place people closer to the nodes or the nod es closer to the people. Map B outlines areas of population density. When we lay the service s map on top of the population map to examine the wa ys they align, it is clear that daily necessities cluster around major thoroughfares and do not necessarily track populat ion density (Map C). The idea of activity nodes is anticipated in the City's 2002 Growth Policies Plan (GPP). The GPP outlines the idea of a \"Neig hborhood Activity Center\" (NAC). A NAC is a \"mixed commercial node that serves as the central focus of each neighb orhood\" that should be easily accessible by pedestrians and minimize auto traffic while providing \"smallscale retail and business services within the context of neighborhoods\" 134 However, the GPP identified just a handful of NACs, only a few of which map onto the critical nodes identified by the Task Force. 135 For the most part, the NACs ide ntified by the GPP do not alig n with critical services, nor are they located in areas of significant population density. 134 GPP, 33. 135 Ibid.

In effort to think th rough where multiple centers m ight fall, the Task Force outlined key neighborhood geograp hic areas; some are defined by alreadyexisting neighborhood associations while o thers are bounded by natural a nd/or built constraints. The result is a city matrix of 55 \"Natural Neighborhoods.\" Col lectively, these neighborhoods defined a basemap for the Task Force on top of wh ich are overlaid the other maps that follow in this Report: activity nodes, walkability, population density, and proximity to bus stops. MAP D: 55 Natural Neighborhoods Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 101Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 102VULNERABILITIES 1. When it comes to land use, the physical separation of where we live from where we carry out the activities of everyday life - work, food, school, health care, and community - is by the biggest threat posed by the end of cheap oil. As fuel prices rise and/or fuel disruptions occur with greater frequency, neighborhoods without access to necessary services will become less livable and could even be abandoned unless efforts are made to tran sform them into self sufficient communities either by adding missing amenities or by developing alternative transportation options. 136 Increasing fuel prices and other costs associat ed with transportation will provide incentives to develop land within the city core and in neighbor hoods that provide key goods and services. Available land for housing in the city cor e and in core neighborhoods could include areas previously used for parking, vacant lots, a nd lots occupied by singlestory buildings. Because of their proximity to necessary amenities, these areas will draw residents from the city's suburban and exurban fringes. 136 Lack of access to neighborhood services has the effect of drivi ng down property values in those areas, making investment in them proble matic at best and nonsensical a t worst. In that case the City may find itself, as Youngstown, Ohio does today, in the position of having to ab andon those areas to function without municipal services and shrinking the municipal boundary. Youngstown 2010. http://www.youngstown2010.com/ [I]t is beginning to dawn on many that the 21st Century will not see the same easy access to low\u00adcost oil that fueled the unprecedented technological advances of the last century. We are either at or very near the era when the demand for oil will outstrip the ability of the earth to supply the needs of the global society. Nygren, Massie, Kern. \"Army Strategy For The End Of Cheap Oil.\" United States Military Academy, West Point, NY. 2006. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 103MITIGATION GOALS & STRATEGIES SHORT\u00ad TERM (1\u00ad5 years) 1. Include planning for peak oil in the Growth Policies Plan (GPP). The GPP was drafted when sustainability was barely emerging and peak oil was not on the planning radar. However, now ev en the American Planning Associ ation has recognized the need to plan for peak.137 As the GPP will be due for an update in 2012, the City should include planning for peak in this guiding land use document. 2. Increase the number of Activity Centers in the GPP. In the interest of both updating the GPP and preparing for a fu ture of energy descent, it is recommended that the City greatly increase the number of Activi ty Centers to bring people within walking distance of e ssential services in all 55 Natural Neighborhoods (Map D). The goal should be to promote small, selfcontained neighborhoods with a clearlydefined center providing essential services, ideally no further than a quarter mile from the edge. Most of the neighborhood activity centers identified in the GPP are sited on the periphery of the community and either do n ot feature essential services a s defined by the Task Force's Activity Nodes map or are not sited in area of dense population. 138 The GPP points out that, \"[i]t should be noted that while several NACs have be en identified on the land use map, more could be designated in the future as further study is done and appropriate locations have been identified.\" 139 137 \"Responding to Peak Oil and Energy Uncertainty\" was a session featured at the American Planning Association's 100th Annual Conference, May 2008. 138 While the GPP also designates areas as \"Community Activity Cen ters\" and \"Regional Activity Centers,\" these areas are assumed to be a ccessed by users who may drive p ersonal automobiles to the centers; therefore, \"walkability\" is not prioritized. 139 Ibid, 33. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 104 3. Include plans for peak oil in the Unified Development Ordinance. The GPP is the City's guiding la nduse policy document. The Unified Development Ordinance (UDO) implements the GPP. In contrast to the GPP, the UDO was drafted as peak oil was entering City consciousness. Indeed, many, if not most, of the changes recommended here were already underway in the very recent past as a result of responses to rising fuel prices as well as suburban flight and urban redevelopment. Much of what Bloomington and Monroe County recognize as their traditional and historic neighborhoods - based on form and not use - would actually be illegal to build today in many areas. The City of Bloomington has already revis ed its zoning rules to place more emphasis on form, but it ca n, and should, do more. Speci fically, the City should amend the UDO to address the following: Remove any residual impediments to micro\u00adagriculture. As is detailed in the Sustenance chapter, local food production will be a critical component of postpeak resiliency. The City Council took an important step forward in fostering urban agriculture with its recent amendment to the UDO, but the City can do more to make land use within the city more farm friendly. Please see Sustenance chapter for detailed recommendations. Encourage form\u00adbased rather than use\u00ad based development. Usebased development is essentially post WWII suburban develo pment where permitted land uses (residential, retail, employment) ar e the defining characteristic of the zoning co de. This encourages, indeed ma ndates, separation of use, which in turns promotes dependence on the a utomobile. Instead, encourage: \u0083 An even stronger commitment to compact, mixeduse urban form; \u0083 Increased residential \u0083 Economic and cultural vibrancy The picture above was featured in a March 2008 article in The Atlantic entitled, \"The Next Slum?\" The article opened by asserting that, \"Fundamental changes in American life may turn today's McMansions into tomorrow's tenements.\"1 Similar structures can easily be found in Bloomington subdivisions. Suzanne Dechillo, The New York Times/Redux Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 1054. Add an Activity Nodes overlay to the UDO. In the interest of ultimately pr oviding all neighborhoods with essential services within walking distance, the City should start with a nodal development overlay as a pilot. Standards for such an overlay should be structured to foster th e essential characteristics of pedestrianfriendly, hum an scale development: Design elements that support pedestrian environments and encour age transit use, walking, and bicycling; Transit access within walking d istance (generally \u00bc mile) of an ywhere within the node; Mixed uses and a commercial core so that essential services are within walking distance; Parks and other public and private open spaces within walking d istance; and A mix of housing types and residential densities. 5. Implement regional planning: Toward a Unified Comprehensive Land Use and Transportation Plan. As we revise the use of the exis ting built environment, we must simultaneously plan for the shape of the future built environment. In a postpeak era, we should be aiming for development patterns that lead to higher population density in areas designated as activity nodes, and that foster mixed use, walking, biking, and transit use. (See Transportation chapter). Right now, transportation planning is largely separate from land use planning and land use planning is a largel y selfcontained effort: Indiana University, Monroe County, and the City of Bloomington all dr aft and implement their plans independent of each other. Without coordinated planning, there is little hope for a compre hensive vision to guide development as transportation fuels become more expensive and a re not as readily available. However, such cooperation is precisely what is called for in the City's GPP. The GPP directs the City to \"[s]tudy the feasibility of creating a consolidated planning department for the City and Coun ty as a method of improving pla nning and development management .\"140 140 2002 Growth Policies Plan, Implementation Measure ACC3, p. 22. https://bloomington.in.gov/media/media/application/pdf/49.pdf Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 106 MEDIUM \u00adTERM (5\u00ad15 years) 1. Transition the City's zoning ordinance to a form\u00adbased code. The City's current zoning document is something of a hybrid. While it contains some provisions focusing on the form of the built environment, much of it is predicated on allowed or prohibited uses. Within the next five to 15 years, the City should replace its zoning ordinance with a formbased code. Unlike usebased codes, a formbased code is a multidisciplinary approach that connects the design of circulation and public space networks to building design. A formbased code would both outline the design of the built e nvironment (for example building height, where buildings should be placed on a lot, den sity of buildings, and street outlay) and provide for a wide r ange of compatible, neighborhood scale uses, as was the case before automobiles and chea p oil started to pervade our li ves. On West 6 th Street, for example, a neighborhood that was developed in the late 19th /early 20th century, several of the houses now used exclusively as residences had neighborhood grocery stores on the ground floor sometime in the pas t, when neighborhoods still pro vided more of what people needed on a daily basis. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 1072. Revisit the use of Tax Increment Financing, particularly as it relates to often\u00ad competing and competitive uses between the City and the County. Tax Increment Financing (TIF), in which property taxes captured in a defined geographic area are used almost exclusively for improvements within the ar ea (as opposed to accruing to a municipal or county general fund), was originally provided as a tool to spur the redevelopment of urban brownfields. 141 TIF came to Indiana in 1987 and in the years since, has greatly expanded as local governments have employed it as an alternative financing model for infrastructure and economic development. Unfortunately, this has taken the use of TIF beyond its original purpose of urban renewal and into a local government financing method of first resort. This has resulted in 70% of TIF monies in Indiana being devoted to automotivedependent sub urban retail (malls, etc.), not urban brownfield redevelopment. 142 TIF has substantially turbocharged sprawl.

An open greenspace, peppered with abandoned limestone quarries and decreed by the County Redevelopment Commission as organically blighted, incapable of normal economic development without an influx of massive amounts of public subsidy. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 108Both the City of Bloomington and Monroe County have redevelopme nt commissions whose power and duty is to establish T IF districts and designations a s well as to control how property taxes collected within those districts are expended wi thin the district. The Monroe County Redevelopment Commission has now established thre e TIF districts, all established over greenfield areas for development of medical offices, warehousing, and suburban retail. The City has es tablished seven TIF districts covering the immediate downtown and Whitehall Plaza as well as the RCA/Thomson Brownfi eld. The City and County Redevelopment Commissions are in competitio n to drive development to their respective TIF areas. This is largely a zerosum game as a firm induced to build on a county suburban greenfield is a firm not available to redevel op an urban brownfield, such as the RCA/Thomson site. In the County there are few brownfields but many remaining greenfields which the County, naturally, would like to see deve loped in order to grow the tax base. The situation often arises where the County wishes to convert a greenfield into some sort of retail, industrial, or employ ment use while urban brownfield s remain undeveloped within Bloomington. Cooperation between the two redevelopment commissions along with concessions between the Cit y and County to help move in the direction of urban redevelopment as opposed to suburban greenfield development wou ld go a long way towards slowing or even reversin g the building out of suburban infrastructure. A regional (countywide or even multicount y) redevelopment commission wou ld be able to consider all parcels within the region as a whole, not just a particular political subdivision, and be able to make decisions that support the original intent of \"redevelopment.\" Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 109 3. Explore school de\u00adconsolidation. From roughly the 1960s onward, th e nation has embarked on a pro gram of school consolidation wherein a number o f traditionally neighborhood sc hools were consolidated in a single larger facility. The purpose of consolidation was to produce cost savings from economies of scale while also pro viding access to facilities an d other aspects of pedagogic infrastructure that would otherwise not be available to student s of smaller and more geographically dispersed schools. The promise of costsavings accruing from consolidation is a so urce of controversy. In any case, there are transportation costs associated with consolidation. With gasoline in the $2 $3/gallon range, the Monroe Coun ty School Corporation is expend ing about 10% of its total budget operating its bus system, outsourcing some of that to pr ivate contractors. As fuel costs rise, the percentage of th e school district's revenue tha t must be diverted from education to transportation will increase. An investigation int o cost savings, if any, realized by consolidation within the two major school corporations (Rich landBean Blossom and Monroe County Community Schools) should be conducted and those results contrasted against greater fuel and other transportation costs associated with deconsolidation. 4. Target public transit routes to help shape neighborhood development. Transit routes affect developmen t patterns. The City should wo rk with Bloomington Transit (BT) to shape the quality and form of residential and commercial development by targeting bus routes and schedul es both to foster neighborhood identity by naming routes or stops for neighborhoods. Howev er, routes should only be exp anded if and as BT achieves fuel efficiency greater than the current 29 passenger miles per gallon, which is actually worse than that of many fuel efficient private automobiles with a typical occupancy load. Better advertising, higher public awareness, and, above a ll, higher fuel prices will all probably result in increased transit ridership, which should, i n turn, lead to better per rider fuel economy for the trans it fleet. A discussion of publi c transit is more fully treated in the following chapter, Transportation . Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 110 5. Build in physical separation buffers along streets and roadways. Road systems should be optimized for multimodal transportation options, including bicycling and pedestrian uses. N atural and artificial buffers between transportation modes should be incorporated into road design wherever feasible. Examples of such buffers include parallel parking provisions along roadsides that allow vehicles to act as safety buffers between pedestrian users of sidewalks and automotive users of the roadway. Automotive buffers, in the form of parked vehicles, can be used to protect bicycle lanes. Bloomington designates bicycle lanes with onroad graphics but there are no physical barriers for traffic se paration. On some of the wider roads, such as College and Walnut and Third Street east of Bryan, a narrow concrete walkwa y built out in the road and against which automobiles park w ould provide a dedicated and protected set of bicycle lanes between the walkway and the associated road shoulder or s idewalk. Manhattan - A bike lane separated from the road by way of a 6' buffer of parked cars. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 111 6. Discourage widening arterial streets where possible. Arterial streets are designed to provide a high degree of mobil ity and generally serve longer vehicle trips to, from, and within urban areas . Contemporary practice has been to emphasize the arterial roadway for connectivity between activity nodes. Arterials, because of their size (particularly width) serve as barriers within a community, segregating parts of the community from other parts. They also represent single points of failure where a serious accident or congestion choke can halt travel on a large scale. While the practi ce of building arterials has largely been discarded by both the City and developers, the City still engages in the widening of existing arterials. Where an arterialstyle road is necessary, the roadway should be constructed in a boule vard style with a significant pedestrianfriendly median (si milar to what exists between College and Walnut where they are separated by MillerShowers Park). In this way, the amount of roadway that must be crossed by a pedestrian at any one time can be minimized. LONG\u00adTERM (15\u00ad30 years) 1. Within 30 years, the City should complete its transition of all 55 Natural Neighborhoods to activity nodes that provide for essential services and transit within walking distance. MillerShowers Park , a narrow strip of land purchased by the City in 1929 for $1 separates two of the C ity's heavilyused arterials. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 112TRANSPORTATION Of all sectors of the U.S. economy, transportation is the most petroleumdependent and the most vulnerable to disruption re sulting from declining world pe troleum supplies. Ninety seven percent of transportation energy is reliant on fossil fue l. Of that figure, fully 95 percent comes from petroleum.143 For decades, low global pet roleum prices prevailed, shaping the way people and goods move. Low oil prices fostered personal automobile ownership and a roa d network that allowed us to live substantial distances fr om where we work, shop, and go to school. Cheap oil also fostered air travel and longdistance trade among nations. As a result, cities like Bloomington have become dependent on other regions for almost everything needed in daily life, from food, clothing, water, transportation fuel, sh elter and medicines to big screen televisions, solar collectors, and wind turbines. One would be hard pressed to find any food, product, or service fo r sale in Monroe County, that doesn't involve any transportation beyond the bounda ries of Monroe County. Even lo callyproduced and sold food usually requires the use of seeds, machines, tools, fertilizer, irrigation systems, fuel, containers, hoop houses, etc. th at have been produced elsewhere and transported to Monroe County over long distances. Because of our reliance on a utomobiles, trucks, container ships, and airplanes for moving goods and/or people, a disruption in the supply of petroleum could affect most e veryday aspects of life in Bloomington and Monroe County. However, there is much we can do reduce our vulnerability to a decline in cheap oil. The level of our community's vul nerability is a function of how easy or hard it is for people, businesses, and institutions to r espond to increasing fuel pric es by reducing petroleum consumption without compromising the basic human needs of shelter, food, water, health care, and transportation. A key aspect of community resiliency will be strengthening our 143 Natural gas comprises approxima tely 2 percent and renewable energy comprises 3 percent of energy used in the transportation secto r. U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration, Annual Energy Review 2008. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 113local transportation system. How vulnerable or resilient we are will be influenced by: The quality and costs of transportation alternatives (walking, biking, public transit, rail, car shares, ride shares, group taxis, etc.); How much we are able to reduce fuel demands proactively by reducing travel demands ahead of, or in step wit h, higher prices and/or reduced availability of fuels; Our ability to buffer sudden shor tages in supply (where fuel is unavailable at any reasonable price); and The availability and cost of alt ernative fuels, alternative fue l vehicles, and fuel efficient vehicles. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 114 REVIEW OF THE CURRENT SITUATION: VMT & EQUITY Automobile Dependency A key index of oil dependency is car ownership. On average, in the United States, there are 755 motor vehicles per 1,000 people (the highest in the world u ntil recently). 144 As with the rest of the nation, resident s of Bloomington and Monroe Cou nty are highly reliant upon their personal vehicles. In Monroe County, there are approximat ely 672 vehicles per 1,000 people.145 See Appendix IV. Vehicle Miles Travelled: Around the Earth 112 Times a Day Another indicator of our dependency is just how much we drive t hose cars. How much we drive is commonly measured by vehiclemiles traveled (VMT). VM T is the total number of miles driven by all residential vehicles within a certain time period in a geographic area. VMT is influenced by population, the number of vehicles per hou sehold, the number of car trips per day, and the distances traveled. In 2003, Monroe County residents drove an estimated 2.8 million miles per day. 146 This distance is the equivalent of: Driving one car from the US east coast to the west coast 933 times in one day. Driving one car around the Earth at the equator 112 times in one day. Driving one car from the Earth to the Moon 12 times in one day. 144 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development . See, William Pentland, \"The World's Top Car Owning Countries,\" Forbes, July 30, 2008. 145 Based on 2000 U.S. Census figures. 146 Bloomington Environmental Commission, Bloomington Environmental Quality Indicators Report , http://bloomington.in.gov/documents/viewDocument.php?document_id=2987 Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 115 The 2.8 million miles we drive each day translate into 22.8 mil es per capita for Monroe County residents. While Monroe County VMT is lower than many o ther communities in Indiana, the figure is substanti ally higher than for comparable college communities such as Washtenaw County, MI (Ann Arbor) whose 11 VMT is roughly half t hat of Monroe County. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, approximately 67 percent of Bloomington workers commuted to work in singleoccupa ncy vehicles, 14.5 percent walked to work, 9.2 carpooled, 2.8 percent used publi c transportation, and 2.7 percent used bicycles.147 These figures indicate a very heavy de pendence on automobile transpor tation. Commuting Into and Out of Monroe County Monroe County is a net \"importer \" of workers. In 2007, a total of 84,468 people (both residents and commuters) worked in Monroe County. Of those, 15 ,859 (almost 19 percent) commuted into Monroe County from neighboring counties. These co mmuters predominantly reside in Owen, Green, and Lawrence Counties. 5,9 52 residents of Monroe County work in other counties.148 147 2000 U.S. Census. 148 STATS Indiana, STATS Indiana Annual Commuting Trends Profile Based on Indiana IT\u00ad40 Returns for Tax Year 2007 http://www.stats.indian a.edu/commtframe.html Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 116Oil & Equity: The Impact of Fuel Costs on Households Budgets People with lower incomes and those travelling great distances are the most vulnerable to a decline in cheap oil. Subtracting out the large student population, the poverty rate of Monroe County hovers somew here around 26 percent.149 The poverty rate for the nation as a whole is 12.5 percent while Indiana's rate is 12.3 percent. In an effort to better understand what increased fuel prices me an for different income brackets, it is instructive to look at average fuel efficiencie s and fuel expenditures as percentages of different income levels. Assuming that Monroe C ounty residents drive approximately 22.8 miles per person per day at an average effic iency of 20.3 miles per gallon (MPG),150 the following illustrates the pe r capita costs of everincreas ing fuel prices. Impact on Income: Increasing Fuel Prices at Average MPG & Average VMT Price per Gallon $2.00 $3.00 $4.00 $5.00 $0.15 $0.20 $0.25 $0.49 Costs per capita per day @ 22.8 miles per capita per day $2.25 $3.42 $4.56 $5.70 $1,664.40 $2,080.50 $4,077.78 Fuel expenses $27,935151 2.94% 4.47% 5.96% 7.45% 14.60% Fuel $15,000 5.47% 8.32% 11.10% 13.87% 27.19% Fuel expenses $6,000 152 13.67% 20.81% 27.74% 34.68% 67.96% 149 Identifying a poverty rate from residents in Monroe County is challenging, due to our significant student population. The US Census puts t he rate at 41.6 percent - a so mewhat inflated rate. A ccording to Todd Lare, Executive Director of the South Central Community Action Program, even if you lowered the 41.6 percent figure by 15 percent to account for the student population, it would leave more than a 26 percent poverty figure among nonuniversity resi dents. Dann Denny, \"40% of City in Poverty: US Census Bureau says Poverty Increased Nearly 7% From 2006 to 2007,\" HeraldTimes Online, S eptember 13, 2008. 150 This is based on the US EPA's computer model - MOBILE 6.2 for estimating emiss ions from highway vehicles. http://www.epa.gov/oms/climate/420f05004.htm . 151 Monroe County 2006 personal per capita income. 152 Poverty level for household of three. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 117The above table serves as a starting point to conduct a benchma rk analysis . The goal of the analysis is to determine how much fuel use would have to be cut by reducing VMT, or how much fuel efficiency would have to increase with rising gas pri ces, to keep the percentage of fuel expenses to income the same as in the table above at a ga s price of $2.00 per gallon. As illustrated above, at $2.00 per gallon and 22.8 VMT, fuel const itutes roughly the following proportion of per capita income: 2.9 percent of $27,035/year; 5 .47 of $15,000/year, and 13.7 percent of $6,000/year. The results are as follows: $5/gallon . At an average gas mileage of 2 0.3 MPG, and a gas price of $5 per gallon, average miles driven would have to go down from 22.8 to 10 mile s per capita per day for the percentage of fuel e xpenditures to income to stay t he same as they were at $2.00 per gallon. That is a reduction in fuel use by 50.7 pe rcent. $10/gallon . With an average gas mileage of 20.3 miles per gallon, and a ga s price of $10 per gallon, average miles would have to go down from 22.8 to 4.5 miles per capita per day, for the percenta ge of fuel expenditures to inco me to stay the same as they are at $2.00 per gallon. Tha t is a reduction in fuel use by 78 percent. Maintaining Average VMT & Increased Economies . Assuming residents do not cut back on driving and continue to average 22.8 miles per capi ta per day, at a price of $5 per gallon, fuel economy wo uld have to increase to 50 miles per gallon on average for the percentage of fu el expenditures to income to st ay the same as they are at $2.00 per gallon and an a verage fuel efficiency of 20.3 miles per gallon. At a fuel price of $10 per gallon, fu el economy would have to double again, to 100 miles per gallon, for fuel expenditures to stay at the same percentag es of income as they are at $2.00 per gallon. Increasing the fuel economy for the w hole vehicle fleet from 20.3 miles per gallon to 50 mile s per gallon is at the current state of technology, and based on the fact that it takes time to phase out and repla ce the existing vehicle stock close to utopian w ithin the next 510 years. Therefore, the most likely scena rio is that people with lower i ncomes will have to respond with drastic cuts in vehicle mil es travelled, since they cannot increase substantially the percentage of fuel expenditures as part of their income. People with higher incomes may not cut down on trips as drastic ally, and take the edge off high fuel costs by buying more fuelefficient new cars.

Income low\u00adincome workers will suffer disproportionately from an increase in fuel pricesReport of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 119 REVIEW OF CURRENT SITUATION: WALKING AND BIKING The City of Bloomington has made a considerable effort to devel op a network of safe, convenient, and attractive bicycle and pedestrian facilities wi th guidance provided by the Bloomington Bicycle and Pedestrian Transportation and Greenways System Plan.153 Indeed, the City is one of 108 communities across the country to be rec ognized as a \"Bicycle Friendly Community\" by the League of American Bicyclists for \"l ongstanding commitments to providing safe accommodation a nd facilities for bicyclists, and for their efforts to encourage b icycle travel for transportatio n and recreation.\" Similarly, Monroe County has developed an alternative transportation plan whose aim is \"making alternative transportation a w ay of life for many Monroe County residents.\" Furthermore, in January 2009, the Bloomington/Monroe County Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) adopted a Complete Streets Policy. The guidelines outlined in the policy ensure that local roadways which are federa lly funded safely accommodate al l users of a corridor, including pedestrians, bicyclist s, users of mass transit, and m otorists. Whether increasing fuel prices c an be offset by turning to walking and biking depends on many factors, including the distance residents need to travel a nd the safety of the bicycle or pedestrian route. If the typical Bloomington resident has an av erage 19minute commute by car, how feasible is it for t he typical resident to bike to work? What about biking or walking to other necessary desti nations such as the grocery store, school, the doctor's office, etc.? 153 Bloomington Bicycle and Pedestrian Transportation and Greenways System Plan (March 2008), http://bloomington.in.gov/medi a/media/application/pdf/57.pdf Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 120The Distance Factor The greater the distances people travel in their cars to get to work and other destinations, the more vulnerable those residents are to a decline in cheap oil. A car driving at an average speed of 20 miles per ho ur travels about 3.3 miles in 1 0 minutes. At a pace of three miles per hour, it would take a person on foot over an hour to cover the same distance. It would take a nonathlete biker r ider about 22 minutes. The foll owing graph shows average work commute times for Bloomington residents in 2000. 0.00%10.00%20.00%30.00%40.00%50.00%60.00%Percentage of Workers Less than 10 minutes1019 2029 3044 4559 60 or more Commute TimeBloomington Commute Time \u00ad\u00ad 2000 Census In 2000, about 32 percent of all commutes by Bloomington reside nts took less than ten minutes, and about 50 percent t ook 1019 minutes. Using the ave rage speeds for walking and biking above, a driver who drives within the city and needs less than 10 minutes to get to work might be able to substitute walking or biking, although walking would require a considerable adjustment in time management. A nine minute car r ide could be replaced by a roughly 45 minute walk or a bik e ride of 20 minutes or less. To put this into perspective, ne w urbanist planners assume \u00bc mi le to be a comfortable walking distance to grocery stores and other necessities of life. This translates into a five minute walk. If a commuter currently enjoys a fivemile 16minu te commute by car, walking the same distance would take over an hour and a half, while biking would take Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 121 about 35 minutes. In other words, if around 67 percent of Bloomington residents c urrently drive alone to work and the average commute time for most of these drivers is 19 minutes, then a shift to other modes of transportation will require a change in habits. For Monroe County residents commuting into Bloomington, walking is almost certainly out of the question and biking would be a challenge. The greater the distance, the lower the likelihood that people will turn to bicycles or walking as ways to get to work, or anywhere else. Land Use Patterns As discussed in the previous chap ter, settlement patterns of th e past have really been shaped by cheap fuel and with little regard to noncar transpor tation. Most new housing developments are separated from other land uses such as schools, shopping centers, workplaces, day care centers, garden supply stores, hardware st ores, theaters, and workplaces. In Bloomington, the distances between these destina tions are easy and fast to overcome by car and, given the l ow fuel prices that prevailed f or decades, it was also inexpensive. However, for most people, the current land use pat terns are major impediments to biking and walking. In some instances, residenti al areas are physically adjacent to shopping areas and o ther land uses, but no direct road connections exist between them, for fear that traf fic might spill into the neighborhood. Taking into consideration all the different things that people are accustomed to doing on a daily basis and considering that residents often make multiple trips in different directions to reach different destinations, walking and biking are just no t feasible alternatives - especially if trips involve youn g children, or the elderly who may move around more slowly. Source: The Associated Press Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 122 Pedestrian Friendliness Just how \"walkable\" is Bloomingt on? In effort to determine thi s, the Task Force calculated the \"WalkScore\" of each of the predefined 55 Natural Neighborhoods (Map D, p. 101).154 WalkScore measures the walkability of an address. The WalkScore system awards points based on proximity of an address to destinations. Walkability falls out into the following categories: 90-100 = Walkers' Paradise: Most errands can be accomplished on foot and many people get by without owning a car. 70-89 = Very Walkable: It's possible to get by without owning a car. 50-69 = Somewhat Walkable: Some stores and amenities are within walking distance, but many everyday trips still require a bike, public transportation, or car. 25-49 = Car\u00adDependent: Only a few destinations are within easy wal king range. For most errands, d riving or public transportation is a must. 0-24 = Car\u00adDependent (Driving Only): Virtually no neighborhood destinations within walking range. You can wa lk from your house to your car! If the closest amenity in a cate gory is within .25 miles (or .4 km), WalkScore assigns the maximum number of points. The nu mber of points declines as the distance approaches 1 mile (or 1.6 km) no points ar e awarded for amenities further than 1 mile. Unfortunately, our \"walkability\" analysis of the city reveals t hat no neighborhood is considered a \"Walker's Paradise\" and only seven are considered \"Very Walkable.\" It should be noted that when Wal kScore maps proximity to a desi gnation, it does so without regard to the nature of the destination. All destinations are granted equal weight: 154 www.walkscore.com Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 123grocery stores, taverns, coffee shops, and nail salons are cons idered equally valuable destinations as grocery stores and doctors' offices. The Task Force attempted to take a more refined look at the activity of each neighborhood, by mapp ing only essential services. Please refer to the Land Use chapter of this Report for an analysis of the Activity Nodes map (Map A). While WalkScore does not prioritize destinations, it is nevertheless an important tool in understanding the pedestrian friendliness of the city's neighborhoods. MAP E: WalkScore Analysis of 55 Natural Neighborhoods Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 124Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 125 Perhaps the biggest hurdle to biking in and around Bloomington is the lack of facilities on arterials. The Bloomington Growth Policies Plan (GPP) gives priority to biking by suggesting all primary arterials, secondary arterials, and primary collectors within the City be constructed with fourfoot bike lanes in both directions. However, as pointed out in the Bloomington/Monroe County Metropolitan Planning Organization's 2030 Long\u00adRange Transportation Plan: Many existing primary and secondary arterials were constructed prior to this new emphasis on alternative transportation, and thus lack adequ ate alternative transportation facilities....The obstacles are arguably greatest for bicyclists on these roads due to the lack of multiuse paths/bi ke lanes, narrow travel lane widths, and ve hicular speeds which create un comfortable and potentially unsafe riding situations. 155 Peak oil provides us with an additional rationale for working t oward retrofitting these arterials with safer facil ities for bicycles and pedestri ans. VULNERABILITIES: BICYCLE & PEDESTRIAN The most critical vulnerabilities of our bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure include the following: 1. Most destinations are located far from residences. 2. Major arterial streets in the city lack adequate bicycle facilities. 155 Bloomington/Monroe County Metropolitan Planning Organization, 2030 Long\u00ad Range Transportation Plan, 68. Cyclist using bike lane on Washington Street Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 126 THE CURRENT SITUATION: PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION Public transportation in our co mmunity is primarily provided by three bus services: Bloomington Transit Corporation, Indiana University Bus System and Rural Transit. Neither the city nor the county have any form of passenger rail connection to surrounding communities. Bloomington Transit and Indiana University Campus Bus System Bloomington Transit (BT) operates nine routes within the corporate boundaries of the City of Bloomington. The regular BT fare for nonIU students is $1; monthly passes are available at $30; and semiannual passes are $150. There are f ree transfers to other BT and Rural Transit routes. Bloomington Transit operates two routes on Sundays. Reduced service is offered on Saturdays. All fleet buses are equipped with bike ra cks and wheelchair ramps or lifts. Bloomington Transit also operates BT Access, a transportation service for pa ssengers with disabilities who cannot use the \"fixed route\" bus system. Between 2006 and 2008, BT ridership increased by 20 percent. 156 This increase resulted partly from an increas e in the IU student po pulation and partly from an increase in gasoline prices. The growth in ridership demonstrates that behavior in B loomington tracks national trends. According to the American Public Transportation Associ ation, on average there was an increase in bus use across the nation by 3.9 percent, \"b ut in communities with a population of less than 100,000, bus services saw an increase o f 9.3 percent in 2008.\"157 Bloomington had the highest per c apita ridership of any city in Indiana with over 40 passengers per capita using transit in 2008.158 156 2,363,526 in 2006; 2,570,117 in 2007; 2,829,950 in 2008 (via L ew May, BT General Manager). 157 American Public Transpo rtation Association, Transit News, March 9, 2009. http://www.apta.com/media/r eleases/090309_ridership.cfm 158 In 2008, Bloomington Transit had 3 million riders. Bloomington has a population of approximately 70,000. Indiana Department of Transportation. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 127 The Indiana University Campus Bus System travels to all points on campus, to downtown Bloomington, and to the College M all. The service is available every day of the week, with reduced service during breaks an d on holidays. The service is a farefree system, and includes BT buses. BT initiated its freetostudents initiativ e in 1999 and saw a marked increase in student ridership. Currently, students comprise ap proximately two of every three BT riders.159 Rural Transit Rural Transit is a bus service a dministered by the Area 10 Agency on Aging. The service is available for everyone regardless of age in Monroe, Owen, and Lawrence Counties. To travel within one county, adults pay $.75. Twocounty fare is $ 1.50 for adults. Senior citizens are asked to donate the full fare amount. Monthly pass es are available. Onecounty monthly passes are $15.00 while tw ocounty monthly passes are $ 18.00. Transfers to and from Bloomington Transit and the Indiana University Campus Bus Service are free. This transfer agreement is key as Rural Transit provides an important connection for trips originating in Bloomington bound for destinations outside city limits. Indianapolis Airport Shuttles Bloomington Shuttle and Star of Indiana are private companies that provide shuttle services to the Indianapolis airport. Bloomington Shuttle picks up and drops off passengers at four locations within Bloomington. The Star picks up and drops off passengers at several IU campus locations. 159 This freefare system is financed by a universal transportation fee charged to IU students. Notably, The City of Bloomington an d Monroe County governments both provide BT bus pass access to all their employees.

Ft. Wayne and South Bend routes are in the planning stages. No Transit Service to Downtown Indianapolis, or Other Neighboring Cities There is currently no regular bus service, private or public, that connects Bloomington with downtown Indianapolis, or any other larger city in the region. The Bloomington downtown Greyhound station was closed several years ago. To reach the I ndianapolis passenger train and Greyhound stations, a traveler without a car would have to take the shuttle to the Indianapolis Airport, and then a bus from the airport to downtown Indianapolis. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 129 VULNERABILITIES: PUBLIC TRANSIT Currently, public transit compris es a small slice of the transportation pie. Only a small portion of the population makes use of it. As discussed earli er, only 2.8 percent of all work commutes are on public transit.160 Similarly, a study conducte d by the Indiana Department of Transportation in 2008 found that public transportation serv es just 1.4 percent of all Bloomington's travel demands.161 1. Fuel prices will be volatile and will increase. While transit is often seen as an alternative to driving when g as prices are high, it is important to remember that trans it itself is vulnerable to incr eased fuel costs and decreased revenue. According to a recent article in The New York Times , \"more people used transit in 2008 than in any year s ince 1956,\" but at the same t ime, many \"transit systems across the country are raising fares and cutting service as the tax revenue they rely on plummets during the recession.\"162 This constitutes a problem, considering that extreme swings in fuel prices are expected to continue as petroleum sup plies diminish worldwide. As discussed earlier, high fuel prices are predicted to drive d emand destruction and stifle economic activity, leading to recessions and wild price fluctua tions. In 2008, as fuel prices soared, BT was forced to reduce the fre quency of its service on some campus routes. This was because IU was not able to increase its contributions to BT to keep up with fuel costs. IU is only a ble to commit to a reimbursemen t schedule on a biannual basis, due to its statemandated budgeting process. BT could no t receive additional funding from IU in a nonbudget year. The IU campus bus system itself also reduced service due to the same budgeting process dilemma. 160 2000 U.S. Census 161 This compares to a \"transit sha re\" of 0.4 percent in the India napolis metro area. Overall, in Indiana, the current urban transit mode share for Indiana is 0.46 percent of all trips. Indiana Department of Transportation, December 2008, Executive Summary, Indiana Mass Transit Studies PL 2032007. 162 Michael Cooper, \"Transit Use Hi t FiveDecade High in 2008 as G as Prices Rose,\" The New York Times, March 9, 2009. http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/ 09/us/09transit.html?_r=1 Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 130 BT owns 42 conventional diesel buses and 2 dieselelectric buses. In 2008, BT consumed 283,699.5 gallons of diesel. Base d on rapidlyincreasing fuel costs in 2008, BT proposed an 84 percent increase in the fuel/o il line item for it 2009 budge t - from $702,000 in 2008 to $1,296,108 in 2009. During this t ime, BT's total operating expe nses increased from $5,724,498 to $6,603,059 a difference of $878,561.

Bloomington Transit has an inadequate fuel reserve. BT is also vulnerable to acute f uel shortages, as it stores only a fourday supply (20,000 gallons) of fuel. Even the shortest of supply disruptions coul d shut down the public bus system, right at a time when the need for public transit would be the greatest. BT has already taken steps to reduce its dependency on petroleum. In addition to 42 conventional diesel buses, BT has 2 dieselelectric hybrid buses in its fleet and will add four more by the end of 2009. At the time this Report was issued, BT was seeking federal funds to buy an additional five diesel electric hybrids. Hybrid buses average about 25 percent better mileage than conventional diesel buses of the same size. A peculiar federal funding formu la essentially makes transit de pendent on the federal gas tax. Gas tax revenue will decline as gasoline use declines. Fo r that reason, we will need to invest much more substantially in public transit from local fun ds to make it a realistic alternative to personal automobile use. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 1313. Transit is still not convenient for many. As fuel prices skyrocketed in 2008, people in cities with a wel ldeveloped public transit system left their cars at home and switched to public transit.163 However, switching to transit will often come at the expense of time. In Bloomington, while it is like ly not too difficult for most p eople close to the city center to find a bus stop within short walking distance, once a patron is on the bus, she may be faced with a long ride to get to a destination as th e bus probably does not take the direct route one would follo w when driving. To get to a destination, a patron may have to transfer to another bus line at the downtown hub. In short , for many, the switch to public transit will be difficult because of the time it takes t o use the system. If people continue to drive for this reason, they may experience increase d financial hardship. However, with adjustments, trans it can be made a viable transportation alterative for more residents. BT has an impressive number of bus stops - 500. Not only is the number impressive, but most bus stops a re within a walkable distance (.25 mile) of most residents (See Map F, following page 164). To make BT a more viable and attractive alternative to the automobile, it would have to offer more frequent service, including weekends and late at night as well as add routes to previously underserved areas. This would require a considerable increase in funding for BT. Unless funding is sec ured in anticipation of future episodes of dramatic fuel price spikes, we may be faced again w ith a situation where, as in 2008, bus service actually has to be cut, when it should be exp anded. 163 American Public Transpo rtation Association, Transit News, March 9, 2009. http://www.apta.com/media/r eleases/090309_ridership.cfm 164 Please note this map should also include Basswood Drive, White hall Crossing Shopping enter and S. Walnut from Winslow all the way down to Rhoe r Road as stops within walking distance. MAP F: Walkability of Bloomington Transit Bus Stops Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 132Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 1334. Funding is inadequate. The fact that securing funding f or transit improvements will be critical is confirmed by INDOT's 2008 Mass Transit Study .165 The study states that \" Local bus systems are undersized in Indiana's cities, and thus currently serve a primarily transitdependent population.\"166 To attract additional riders, t he study suggests that \"servic e expansion should focus on building fleet s izes and adding more frequent service in the existing service areas, with limited expansion to new destinations that are focu sed on access to employment (i.e. Express Bus). Lo wfrequency service is current ly a barrier to higher utilization of the system, especially by choice riders.\"167 What is of special i nterest for this Report and the assessment of vuln erabilities is that the INDOT Mass Transit Study also states that the current mix of transportation funding available to improve transit systems does not generate sufficie nt revenue to accommodate the recommended transit investments that are necessary to meet current unmet demands, much less the likely increases in demand as a result of peak oi l. The pattern outlined in the INDOT study makes it clear that the national trend of driving less translates into reduced federal fuel tax revenues, which means fewer federal tax dollar s are available for transit and highway programs in the State of Indiana. Investing in our public transit infrastructure to make it easie r for people to use the system will result in greater ridership. Greater ridership will translate into greater funding to make up for the shortfall lost t o decreased revenue from the fe deral gasoline tax. 165 Indiana Department of Transportation, Executive Summary, Indiana Mass Transit Studies PL 2032007, (December 2008), E6. 166 \"Transitdependent\" refers to people who cannot drive because t hey are poor, sick, too old to drive, or disabled. 167 Ibid. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 1345. Intercity rail is not available. Intercity passenger rail is currently not available, even though there is some interest in developing a BloomingtonIndiana polis rail or commuter bus conn ection at the state level.168 Having intercity rail or a commu ter bus system fueled by renew able fuels would be a great benefit for Bloomington a nd Monroe County, and would be a necessary complement to a welldeveloped local transi t system. Together, these modes would significantly help reduce our collective reliance on the personal automobile. 6. Ride shares and car pools are not prevalent. People commuting to Indianapolis to work or study often informa lly arrange for ride shares to cut down on driving ti me and to save fuel. Ridesharin g in Indiana is becoming a bit more organized thanks to on line tools whereby Bloomingtoni ans and others can arrange car pools for daily commu ting, crosscountry travel, or short occasional trips for shopping or for going to the doctor or to the airport.169 7. Monroe County Community School Corporation is highly dependent upon petroleum. Like other major regional institutions, the Monroe County Community School Corporation (MCCSC) is highly reliant on petr oleum and is vulnerable to a decline in cheap oil. In 2007, MCCSC consumed 189,000 gallons of liquid fuel. That is about 1 ,050 gallons per day for the 180 days that school is in session. MCCSC has a storage capacity of 24,000 gallons 12,000 gallons of unleaded and 12,000 gallons of diesel. All the scho ol buses run on diesel; while the maintenance vehicles run on gasoline. MCCSC buses run about 11,000 mile s per day, and get between 6 a nd 10 miles per gallon. This means that fuel use for bus es is somewhere between 1,100 a nd 1,800 gallons per day. With a 12,000 gallon tank for dies el, this means that MCCSC has only between 6.5 days and 168 See, Indiana Department of Transportation, Final Report: Central Indiana Commuter Rail Feasibility Study, August 2008. 169 See for example http://www.erideshare. com/statecity/IN.htm and http://www.carpoolworld.com/ for details Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 13511 days worth of supplies when a ll tanks are filled 100 percent. Depending on the frequency of fuel deliveries, ac tual reserves on hand at any on e time could be far less. Like Bloomington Transit and the IU Campus Bus System, MCCSC st ruggled with finding ways to cover increasing fuel co sts in 2008. Indeed, by Septem ber 2008, the school corporation found itself with a $150,000 shortfall in its trans portation budget. MCCSC tried to meet this shortfall by consolidating programs, transfe rring money from its school bus replacement fund and charging student athletes with a trans portation fee. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 136MITIGATION GOALS & STRATEGIES In the summer of 2008, households, businesses and public entities responded to higher fuel prices in very predictable and pragmatic ways: they cut unneces sary trips, sought ways to increase fuel efficiency and switched to public transportation options, if available. In this period, the number of miles traveled by residential vehicles in the U.S. fell by 3.6 percent.170 Such a reduced reliance on the c ar is good practice for prepari ng for a permanent decline in the availability of cheap oil, b ut to really prepare for peak, we need to invest in a less petroleumdependent infrastructure and we need to move towards broader cultural acceptance of walking, biking and public transit and other alternatives to the singleoccupancy vehicle. In planning for this transition, it is important to realize that within the coming 1015 years, it is unlikely that we will see the drastic acrosstheboard in creases in vehicle fuel efficiency that will be needed to fully compensate for the effe cts of price increases or reduced availability of fuels. N or are alternative fuels likel y to be available at the scale and at the price to which people have been accustomed. Therefore, as petroleum supplies diminish and prices increase, we can anticipate that: Higher fuel prices will consume greater proportions of public a nd private b u d g e t s ; The distance that raw materials, goods and people travel to rea ch their endpoint must be reduced; Where longdistance transport of raw materials, goods and peopl e is critical, much more efficient modes of transpo rtation must be identified; and To reduce the risks from fuel shortages, we need to convert our vehicles to alternative fuels, or make sure we invest in fuel storage. 170 U.S. Department of Energy, \"U.S. Transit Use Up, Driving Down i n 2008,\" Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy News, March 11, 2009, http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=12283 Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 137In proposing the measures below, our premise is that the best w ay to mitigate the social and economic disruptions from de clining petroleum supplies is t o proactively embrace, plan, prepare for and support the necessary restructuring and a daptations in local public and private transportation systems. Therefore, most of the miti gation measures proposed below are focused on implementin g strategies in the very near term with the aim of realizing a substantive reduction in oil reliance in the long t erm. SHORT\u00ad TERM (1\u00ad5 Years) 1. Use \"lows\" in fuel price swings wisely: reduce consumption, establish an emergency fuel fund. It is unclear how long the current recession will last and how long fuel prices will remain relatively low. It may be years until the world economy - and fuel prices - rebound, or it may happen rather quickly. Several public entities responded to the price spikes in 2007 and 2008 by increasing fuel budgets for 2009. Then fuel prices declined. These are the price swings symptomatic of oil price volatility we can expect in the future. Public and private entities, including the City of Bloomington, City of Bl oomington Utilities, Bloomington Transit, Indiana Univ ersity, Monroe County, the Mon roe County School system, as well as households, b usinesses, churches and other institutions, can benefit by planning for future increases in fuel prices now. In anticipation of price volatil ity, public and private entitie s should use current and future temporary reductions in fuel prices to redirect already budgete d higher fuel expenses into: a) investments that promise lower f uel consumption in the future; or b) special emergency funds that can help buffer spiraling fuel cos ts in the future. Over time, these funds should b ecome less and less important. T hey are only helpful as long as needed reductions in travel demands are not yet accomplished, and/or there is a continuing need for fossil fuels. Basically, this amounts to pl anning upcoming budgets as if fuel prices were to remain chron ically high and directing any s urplus funds during times of low prices into projects that reduce fossil fuel demand in the long run, or into emergency funds to buffer price spikes. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 138 2. Develop a community cooperative ride \u00adshare system. One of the greatest transportati on vulnerabilities stems from c urrent land use and commuting patterns. About 19 perc ent of the Monroe County workforce commutes from surrounding counties. Even within the county, there are pocket s of lowdensity exurban settlement that are distant from activity nodes and for which i t is costly to provide public transit. In the shortterm, one of the ea siest and most effective ways t o drastically increase fuel efficien cy is not the purchase of more fuel efficient vehicles, but decreasing fuel use per passenger mile by maximizing the capacity of our community's existing vehicles. Over the next five years, the community's biggest employers - Indiana Un iversity, the City of Bloomington, Monroe C ounty, Bloomington Hospital, s chools, and other organizations - should work cooperatively to establish an elect ronic carpooling match system whereby employees of any of these institutions can identify ride share opportunities with the employees of any of the other entities. By combining all the workplaces, the pool of people s eeking and offering ride shares is increased, making it more likely that people who commu te from other counties and who se residences are distributed over a large area will find someone else close by with whom they are able to share the commute. Having a welldesigned rideshar ing system like this in place w ould provide much needed insurance against sudden price spikes and fuel shortages. The higher prices rise, the more attractive it would be to partic ipate in the system. The benefi ts to each participant would be immediate and major disruptions from people not being able t o afford the trip to work could be avoided. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 1393. Implement a car\u00adsharing program. A natural complement to a ri de share program is a car share program. Car sharing is an urban car rental service whereby customers who sign up as members can reserve a rental car for p eriods of time as short as one hour. Patrons pick up the car at a designated place in their neighborhood and return it to the same spot. Car sharing allows people who only occasionally need a car, to ge t rid of their car. To take advantage of such a program, participants become members of a car sharing coop or program. Rates are affordable and include fue l, maintenance, insurance and parking of the vehicle at its home site. Car sharing allows for those commuting via ride share, transit, bike or foot to have shortterm access to a car when needed. Car sharing is widely recognized to be a key component of an integrated mobilitymanagement system and enjoys widespread use in cities such as: Seattle, Chicago, Portland, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Denver, San Diego, Toronto, Boston, New York, and Washington, DC. In these cities, forprofit or nonprofit organizations maintain the car sharing fleet and reservation website. Recently, the City of Baltimore, Maryland issued a request for proposals to establish a car share program for its residents. 171 171 http://www.cmtalliance.org/news_ files/carsharerf p/Car%20Share%2 0RFP%202009.pdf Car sharing: A Brief Review Car sharing in the U.S. has gained increasing popularity ever since the first program began in Portland in 1998. A car sharing system has a relatively small fleet of vehicles available at designated stations exclusively for use by members of the program. Members reserve vehicles on an hourly basis, and may do so online or by phone. Car sharing allows individuals to gain the benefits of a private vehicle without having to own one. In some cases, car sharing can make having a car-free home feasible. Car sharing improves mobility, reduces vehicle miles travelled, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, reduces traffic congestion and parking problems, increases alternative transportation options, offers savings for members; and expands access to cars to individuals who do not own a vehicle. Municipalities can play a role in helping to promote car sharing. Seattle has parking stalls designated specifically for car sharing vehicles. Austin provides parking spaces for car sharing vehicles and exempts them from parking meter charges. San Francisco requires dedicated parking for car sharing vehicles for all new residential projects with 50 units or more. Compiled by: Sarah Germann Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 140The City should establish or encourage the establishment of a citywide car sharing program. Car sharing reduces the need for personal vehicle ownership and the demand for parking. It also stands to save residents money and would allow local businesses and non profits to economize on their fleets. 4. Land use: make the best of the existing built environment. The goal of postpeak land use planning with regard to transportation is bringing daily necessities closer to where people live, so that biking, walkin g and transit become more feasible and automobile trips be come shorter. This can be done by facilitating changes in land use toward increased density and mixed use. Since the buil t environment changes rather slowly, the priority within the first five years is to m ake the best of what we have, by starting the process of changing how existing structures can be used. As outlined in the previous chapter on Land Use, one obvious improvement would be to encourage even more mixed uses i n our zoning laws, making it possible for small businesses to locate closer to wh ere their customers live, thus reducing the need for automobile trips and facilitatin g walking, biking, and public t ransit. Another improvement would be to allow more flexibility for home owners to divide up an existing building into smaller units, to add wings, or to add granny flats, in order t o create additional dwelling units. 172 These measures increase population density, and may meet a growing need for fairly inexpensive housing close to activity nodes, as more people want to live closer to where they work and shop. Besides facilitating walking and biki ng, increasing density is a very important aspect of making public transportation costeffe ctive and attractive for both riders and providers. To start that process, community involv ement and support are necessary. Ideally, the process of allowing a more flexible use of the existing built environment should be propelled from the \"bottom up.\" 172 Permitting granny flats in resi dential districts has been a so urce of much local controversy. Please see the Housing chapter for further discussion of granny flats. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 141To that end, we recommend that: The City, in cooperation with other local entities like Transition Bloomington , the City of Bloomington Commission on Sustainability, the Center fo r Sustainable Living, and others, encourage, promote, and support Transition training for all 55 Natural Neighborhoods (Map D, p. 101) within the next five years. As discussed in the Economic Context chapter of this Report, the Transition Movement, motivated by the twin challenges of climate change and peak oil, aims to organiz e citizens at neighborhood and community levels around sustainable living. The City staff stay in contact wi th neighborhoods as they engag e in Transition projects and assist them in formu lating changes to land use reg ulations that help them achieve their Transition goals. The City promptly implement changes as they are proposed by nei ghborhoods, amending existing codes where needed. If neighborhoods differ greatly wi th respect to the changes the y are willing to undertake, the City Council should consider neighborhoodspeci fic codes (or neighborhoodspecific waivers of current codes) so as to not i mpede progress in neighborhoods that are willing to be more bold than others. Th ose neighborhoods could become models for others, and pave the way for more widespread acceptance of changes in local codes. (See also the Land Use chapter's recommendation for a pilot nodal overlay to the UDO). 5. Work toward a Unified Comprehensive Land Use and Transportation Plan As we revise the use of the exis ting built environment, we must simultaneously plan for the shape of the future built environment. In a postpeak era, we should be aiming for development patterns that lead to higher population density in areas designated as activity nodes, and that foster mixed use, walking, biking and transit u se. (See Land Use chapter). Right now, transportation planning is largely separate from lan d use planning and IU, Monroe County and the City of Bloomington all draft and impleme nt their plans independent of each other. Withi n the next five years, the City , County and IU should work with each other and with neighbor hoodbased Transition groups t o establish a coordinated planning process that will result in a countywide, unified and comprehensive Land Use and Transportation Plan. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 142 6. Update the Long \u00adRange Transportation Plan with an eye to peak oil. As the Bloomington/Monroe County Metropolitan Planning Organization prepares to update its Long\u00adRange Transportation Plan, it should do so informed by the phenomenon of peak oil and the likelihood that reliance on the personal automobile will decrease while reliance of public transit, walk ing and biking will increase. 7. Increase connectivity for bicyclists. Build out bicycle boulevards As discussed above, the City of Bloomington has made a consistent effort to foster a robust bicycle and pedestrian infrastructur e. Bloomington's 2008 Bicycle and Pedestrian Transportation and Greenways System Plan makes this commitment even stronger. The Plan stresses the importance of connectivity - of making it possible for bicyclists to reach destinations on a network of routes that provide safe and fast travel. The Plan gives high priority to the concept of \"bicycle boulevards.\" L oosely modeled on Berkeley California's bicycle boulevards, Bloomington's bicycle boulevard program is intended to provide a ccommodations for bicyclists on existing roads, the purpose of which is a \"high degr ee of freeflow bicycle travel, access to major destinations, comfortable bicycling conditions , and minimal conflicts with motorists and pedestrians.\" Bicycle boulevards should provide significant eastwes t and/or northsouth connectivity along lengthy corridors and conne ct people to places of work, r esidence, shopping, studying and play. The 2008 Plan outlines the intent to build a number of bicycle boulevards within the city and assigns these a \"high priority,\" but does not attach a timeline to the construction of the boule vards. The City should aim for constructing all of the bicycle boulevards identified in the Plan within the next five years. Bicycle Boulevard street markings in Berkeley, California Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 143Amend the Bicycle, Pedestrian and Greenways Plan to significantly increase the number of planned \"lengthy corridors.\" At present, the Plan only includes two substantial ea stwest bicycle boulevards: th e 6th/7th Street/Longview Avenue Bicycle Boulevard and the Allen Street/C ovenanter Drive Bicycle Boulevard. While these boulevar ds are critical, alone they ar e insufficient to foster the kind of eastwest connectivity that is truly needed for bicycle riders in a postpeak environment. The City should add more eastwest connective corridors by exploring options such as closing off lane s or closing streets for automo bile thru traffic and opening these streets up for bicycles, skateboards, pedestrians and other lowspeed traffic. Usually bicycle boulevards do not completely exclude cars, but limit th em in some ways. Boulevards are most appropriate on roads which have slower spee ds and less vehicular traffic. They are generally o pen to emergency vehicles. We encourage the City to pursue this option boldly. The post pe akoil economy may strap City budgets of the means to pur sue investments into more costl y bicycle and pedestrian facilities, including multiuse trails separate from roadways o r separate sidepaths along arterials dedicated to bicycles. The City should therefore put the highest priority on conversion of existing streets ( or lanes) to bicycle traffic, e ven along now busy arterials, keeping in mind that in a postpeak future, automobile travel i s likely to shrink, making this kind of conversion more feasible. In transitioning any road to a ccommodate bicycle traffic, the C ity should aim to narrow the lanes for car traffic as much as possible, ideally to nine feet in width. Such narrowing will help slow traffic speeds and make drivers more aware of bicycli sts and pedestrians in addition to allowing a wider space for bicycle lanes. 173 173 Dan Burden and Peter Lagerwey, Road Diets: Fixing the Big Roads, 1999, Walkable Communities, http://www.walkable.org/ Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 144Make bike riding on major arterials safer While the City has made great efforts to improve bicycle transp ortation and bicycle safety, it should accelerate its effort t o foster safe bicycle riding o n major arterials and highways such as: Old State Road 37, North Dunn Street, West 2nd and West 3rd, as identified in the City's Bicycle, Pedestrian and Greenways Plan and incorporated into the MPO's 2030 Long\u00ad Range Transportation Plan. It is imperative that local governments aggressively pursue funding to build these projects as soon as possible. 8. Make bus transportation faster and more attractive Bus Lanes Likewise, dedicating a network of existing streets and lanes as bus lanes makes bus service faster and more reliable. The City and BT should start explorin g the cost and feasibility of several fast eastwest and north south routes in which buses ha ve priority. In the long term, such bus lanes would idea lly serve a considerable number of neighborhoods. In the short term, the City should work with BT to secure funding for at least one eastwest and one northsouth connection. More bus line intersection Another key improvement to transit is providing more opportunit ies for people to switch between bus lines. More convenient and faster connections will cut down on travel time and provide a better substitute for automobile travel. Plannin g for more sites of intersection should commence now and be realized over the next 15 years. Possible ways of accomplishing this are one or more circular routes that intersect with the existing routes, or development of a system of routes that roughly follow a grid pattern. 9. Seek cooperation for trip consolidation. The City of Bloomington should foster a spirit of cooperation b etween different private and public entities in seeking out and identifying opportunities fo r trip consolidations and for reductions i n travel demands. For example: Meter reading for wa ter, electricity, and gas could be coordinated, and all thes e readings done on one trip, instead of three separate ones. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 14510. Seek cooperation for \"bus sharing.\" In effort to increase the efficiency of bus operations by incre asing the number of riders per bus, BT should build on the IUBT cooperative precedent and exp lore cooperation with Monroe County School Corporation . School buses sit idle most of the day, at night, and several months during the year. Therefore, opportunities to reduce the school bus fleet and to increase the use of BT buses by having some children picked up and taken to school by BT should be explored. During s chool pickup and dropoff time s, BT buses may be scheduled to make more frequent stops in certain neighborhoods to pick up children. Also, during offpeak times BT buses could be used for school trips. During summers, there may be opportunities to offer unused capacity for longdistance bus trips to the public. Using idle buses (during daily and seasonal offpeak times) for transportation of goods, rather than people, should be explored as well. The money saved from running and maintaining a smaller fleet of buses, and from running busses more efficientl y, could then be used to further increase levels of service, or to be able to more quickly replace existing buses with alternative fuel buses that are less vulnerable to fuel price s pikes. The Task Force recognizes that this proposal comes with constra ints. First, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) pro hibits federallyfunded transit systems from providing exclusive school bus service and places constraints on competition with freight carriers. Secondly, some parents may have concerns about mixing students with the general population on public transit bus es. However, the community can begin the process of moving some public school students (middle and high school students) onto existing public transit routes where existing ro utes provide good connections t o/from schools. If this incremental measure can be pro ven successful, it will help effo rts to expand the use of public transportation for school transportation. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 14611. Seek greater public investment in the transit system. Only a public transit network that is easily accessible and off ers high levels of service with regard to speed, frequency, and quality of service can truly be considered a viable option for people who can no longer affo rd automobile travel as fuel p rices increase. A robust transit system includes service at night and during weekends, d edicated bus lanes, bus shelters, and good pedestrian a ccess to bus stops. If the trans it system requires a lot of time to negotiate and is not availabl e when people need it, its usef ulness as a transportation alternative will be very limited. The lack of robust, viable t ransportation alternatives will result in more severe local economic disruptions. Gas tax About 20 percent of BT's annual operating budget is comprised of federal dollars - largely funds from the gas tax. Since 1993, approximately 18.4 cents of every gallon of gasoline is levied by the federal government to pay for roads, bridges and transit. The link between transit and the gas tax is probl ematic in at least two ways. F irst, the gas tax heavily favors the construction of roads and br idges over transit as fully 80 percent of the tax is devoted to roads and only 20 percent is d edicated to public transit. T herefore, the current system favors road building over transi t and actually encourages subur banization and a low population density that makes it difficult for BT to serve thes e areas. In a postpeak future, we know this is a problematic a pproach. Secondly, the tax its elf is unstable. Decreased demand for gasoline, as we exp erienced in the summer of 2008, c auses gasoline revenue to drop appreciably and transit suffers. Funding As INDOT recommended in its recent analysis of transit in Indiana, to reach levels of service necessary to realize even modest increases in ridership , an increase in funding must come from the local or regional level. 174 Local funding is critic al considering that a postpeak environment will occasion both 1) increased demand fo r transit and 2) decreased state and federal funding. 174 Indiana Department of Transportation, Executive Summary, Indiana Mass Transit Studies PL 2032007 (December 2008). Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 147 For years, transit has been woefu lly underfunded at all levels of government. The community, state and nation need to invest much more heavily in our public transportation systems. This might mean new tax es or shifting existing tax funds from other programs to our public transportation system. The City should be visionary here and work with BT to advocate for a greater public investment to improve and expand transit services and to transition buses to nonpetroleum sources of fuel. 12. Explore the option of a \"no fare\" Bloomington Transit system The IU Campus Bus system current ly operates as a \"no fee\" syste m. Other communities in Indiana, such as Marion, are ope rating public transit free of charge. BT should explore the possibility of implementing a \"no fare\" system. On special day s when BT does not charge a fare to ride the bus, it experiences a 15 percent increase in ridership. Bloomington's Growth Policies Plan prioritizes increasing transit ridership a nd calls for the City to \"[c]oordinate with Bloomington Transit to study the feasibility of allowing universal transit access for all citizens of Bloomington.\" 175 However, fares currently bring in around $400,000$500,000 per year and cover 2025 percent of BT's transit costs. As the loss of fare revenue woul d be significant, it might very well mean that some transit service would be cut. The City and Monroe County should work with BT to closely examine such feasibility and should help identify sources of revenue needed to invest in the BT infrastructure to help meet increased demand occasioned by a free fare system. 175 GPP, Implementation Measure, MT5, 15. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 148 13. Fully unify the BT and campus bus systems. A unified transit system wherein IU and BT are joined offers the potential to increase funding from the State of Indian a significantly. Indeed, as much as $2 million could be acquired if the Indiana Department of Transportation approved s uch unification. $2 million would help provide a higher level of service to the community. The City should work with BT and IU to fully support such a merger. 14. Explore methane digesters to produce biogas for transportation Organic, locallygenerated was te, such as food waste, is a potential rich store of energy that could be used to fuel transit buses. This waste is a source of methane - a primary component of natural gas. BT stores a maximum fourday supply of fuel, and MCCSC stores a maximum of somewhere between 6.5 and 11 days of fuel under the best of circumstances, which assumes that the st orage tanks are full when the crisis hits. Locallyproduce d gas that fuels transit buses and school buses would greatly reduce the risks to this community from interruptions in supply of transportation fuels. A United Nations publication states, \"[a] t present biogas is the most immediately practicable means for powering a conventiona l internal combustion engine fr om biomass.\"176 According to a publication by the Oil Depletion Analysis Centre and the Post Carbon Institute, the great potential of biogas as a transportation fu el has already been demonstrated and acknowledged in many different countries: In the city of Lille in northern France, 120 of the city's 400 buses run on biogas made from locally sourced food waste, with one new gaspower bu s commissioned every week. By 2012 all buses will run on a mix of o n e t h i r d natural gas, twothirds biogas. The biogas is produced by an an aerobic digester at the bus terminus, which fuels not only the buses but also the l orries that collect the waste. This means there is a high degree of insulation to s hort term interruptions in the oil supply.177 176 Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/ah810e/AH810E13.htm 177 Oil Depletion Analysis Centre and the Post Carbon Institute, Preparing for Peak Oil: Local Authorities and the Energy Crisis , http://www.odacinfo.org/sites/od ac.postcarbon.org/files/Preparing_for_Peak_Oil.pdf A large biogas digester in Japan. Source: Sustainable Cities Blog, http://blog.cunysustainablecities.org Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 149According to this report, a stud y into the potential of biogas for Britain found that \"Britain produces some 30 million dry ton nes of food waste and agricultu ral manure per year, and this could produce over six milli on tonnes of oil equivalent in biomethane. That equates to about 16 percent of total transpo rt fuel demand, while public t ransport consumes less than five percent. In other words, Bri tain could fuel a public trans port network three times bigger than today's on food and agricultural waste alone.\"178 However, the Task Force recogniz es that any new technology exacts a cost. Any new fuel brings with it the requirement f or substantial investment in in frastructure, the possible necessity to relocate maintenanc e/fueling facilities, costs to equip new buses with engines appropriate to the fuel, and cos t to train personnel on maintaining alternative fuel propulsion systems. Furthermore , sometimes alternative fuels are not as reliable and technologies to use alternative fuels are often much less matur e. As a result, buses relying on alternative fuels may break d own more frequently, and servic e may, at times, be unreliable. The City should work with BT to fully research the costs and benefits of biodigesters. If research reveals that biodigest ers would work in our community , fuels generated should be used for BT, the City and MCC SC vehicles and placed in locat ions appropriate for fueling the respective fleets, as well as for fueling the vehicles that collect organic materials. Remaining supplies should be offered to Monroe County or other users. The fertilizer that is generated as a byproduct of such digesters would be useful for local gardeners and farmers. 178 Ibid. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 15015. Establish public or private long \u00addistance bus service between Bloomington and Indianapolis; encourage the establishment of commuter rail. At present, no public transit connections exist between Bloomin gton and train and bus stations located in downtown Indianapolis. The only way to get downtown Indianapolis from Bloomington without a car i s to take one of the two shuttl e services from Bloomington to the Indianapolis airport and then to take public transit from the airport to one of the downtown sites. The l ack of a BloomingtonIndianapol is transit connection makes it difficult to connect up with trains and buses leaving from Indianapolis to Chicago, Cincinnati, Louisville, and othe r popular regional destinations . It also makes it very difficult for Bloomington residents commuting to downtown Indianapolis to transition to the Indianapolis transit system. We strongly encourage the current shuttle services and other companies to explore the possibility of offering similar services to several spots in the downtown Indianapolis area within the next five years that woul d meet the needs of both commuters and occasional travelers. We further encourage the City an d the County to stay in active dialog with the state to ensure that Monroe County is par t of any commuter rail system p lanned by the state. Currently, the Indiana Department of Transportation is consider ing a rail or bus route between Indianapolis and Bloomington. 179 179 INDOT, Final Report Central Indiana Commuter Rail Feasibility Study, August 2008. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 151MEDIUM \u00adTERM (5 \u00ad15 Years) 1. Increase connectivity and safety for bicyclists Within the next five to 15 years, there should be at least four eastwest and four north south bike boulevards fully opera ble and fully extending to the boundaries of the city. All major arterials should be outfitted with sidepaths or bike boul evards. 2. Improve levels of service for BT Within the next five to 15 years, plans developed in the first five years should start to be implemented with regard to large r number of dedicated bus lanes, and creation of multiple points where riders can switch bus lines. If the efforts of the first five years to develop additional funding sources and c ooperate with MCCSC are success ful, levels of service should be steadily increased during the following years by incr easing frequency of service, adding new lines, expanding service on Saturdays and Sundays an d later into the night, providing bus shelters and easy access to bus stops. 3. Expand the use of methane digesters to produce biogas for transportation. The City should continue to expa nd its collection of organic wa stes for biogas production, and expand the production of biogas accordingly. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 152LONG\u00adTERM (15\u00ad30 years) 1. Shrink road width and automobile road infrastructure. As fuel supplies dwindle and veh icle miles travelled contract, and as carpooling, transit use, car sharing, walking and biking expand, there should then be considerably fewer numbers of vehicles on the road. After 15 years, the City may consider shrinking its road infrastructure dedicated to automobiles by reducing road widths and making multilane roads into twolane roads. This would help the City reduce road maintenance operations, and would free up funds that probably will be sorely needed for other purposes. 2. Continue the expansion of public transit through compact urban form and intra\u00ad city connections. Fifteen years down the road, population density should have inc reased in areas where essential services like grocery stores, schools, pharmacies, post offices, public libraries, restaurants, hardware stores, department stores and farmers' ma rkets are located. This will allow BT to run bus lines mo re efficiently, since more peo ple are likely to board at each stop, and buses will be fuller. This will put BT into a positi ve feedback loop, where increased ridership encourages increased levels of service, and vice versa. We recommend that BT continue its path of car efullyplanned improvements in the levels of service, attracting more and more riders. Once the local transit system is well developed, the feedback loop will be further enh anced by having transit connec tions with other cities besides Indianapolis. We recomme nd the City work toward establi shing those connections. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 153HOUSING \"Peak oil and climate change require a revolutionary change to all aspects of our lives. The energy used and CO 2 generated by the automobile or from food production is much less than the energy consumed by US buildings. Furthermore, building energy consumption has been continually increasing in spite of improvements in building efficiency.\" - Pat Murphy180 Oil and housing are closely linked. Although oil is not directl y used by most homes in the U.S., the energy required to heat and cool our homes derives fr om energy sources reliant on oil for their production and del ivery. In Indiana, fully 95% o f our electricity is powered by coal. Coal requires oil for min ing and transport. Therefore, as the price of oil rises, so too will the price of electricity. Add to this picture the likelih ood that, as the price of electricity increases, more people will look to other sources of energy such as natural gas to heat and cool their homes. As more people rely on natural gas, the price of natural gas will incre ase. As detailed in Appendices II and III, both coal and natural gas production are projected to peak ar ound 2030. All of these effects gear up into what is referred to as \"peak energy. \" In light of peak energy, we must start to imagine alternativ e ways to heat and cool our homes in ways that conserve energy and save money. 180 Pat Murphy, Plan C: Community Survival Strategies for Peak Oil and Climate Change (New Society Publishers: Garbriola, Island, BC, 2008), 143 Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 154REVIEW OF THE CURRENT SITUATION Housing Units As of the last U.S. Census, Bl oomington had 26,468 housing units. 17,127 (65%) were renteroccupied and 9,341 (35%) were owneroccupied.181 As defined by the Census, a housing unit is \"a hou se, an apartment, a mobile home , a group of rooms, or a single room that is occupied (or i f vacant, is intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters.\"182 \"Housing unit\" does not necessarily mean a \"house.\" There are 7,952 single family owneroccupied homes. The average household size in Bloo mington is 2.09 people. Efficiency Most of the housing in Bloomington was built in an era of cheap energy. As a result, much of our housing stock tends to be inefficient.183 The Energy Informatio n Association reports that the least energyefficient homes are those constructed bet ween 19591989. The lowest energy users were genera lly constructed before 1959, wit h post1989 construction coming in a close second.184 Approximately 46% of the city's total housing units were built between 1960 and 1990.

In 2000 , the average Bloomington household has shrunk while the a verage size of a singlefamily residence has increased. In 2000, the average household size in Bloomington was 2.09 people - 0.50 fewer people than the national average.188 From 2000 to 2009, homes built in Monroe County averaged 2,54 7 square feet,189 almost 400 square feet large r than the U.S. average. 187 Murphy, 146. 188 U.S. Census 2000. Bloomington's small household size is very likely due to its large student population. 189 Personal communication, Monro e County Building Department. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 157Home Heating Fuel In both Bloomington and Monroe C ounty, most heating fuel is eit her utility, bottled, tank, or liquefied petroleum gas or electricity. In 2006, natural gas accounted for 59.71% o f total energy consumed in the Bloomingt on residential sector, while co al accounted for the remaining 40.29%. The total amount of coal consumed (95% of electricity production) was equivalent to 292,424,591 kWh. Als o that year, the equivalent of 433,462,717 kWh of natural gas was consumed (heatin g plus 5% of electricity generation).190 As mentioned previously, both the price of electricity and natural gas are e xpected to increase as the price of oil becomes more volatile and more expensive. Energy Consumption Distribution In addition to looking at sources of our residential energy use , it is important to look at how we use that energy. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, in residential buildings, space heating and cooling, lighting, and water heating account for 66% of the total energy consumption. ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS End Use Residential Buildings Space Heating 31% Lighting 11% Space Cooling 12% Water Heating 12% Refrigeration Electronics Cooking 5% Wet Clean 5% Computers 1% Other 9% Adapted from U.S. Department of Energy, 2007 Energy Data Book.

Owner\u00adoccupied rehabilitation program . This home rehabilitation loan is funded by federal tax dollars and admin istered by the City of Bloomington's Housing and Neighborhood Development Departm ent (HAND). An amount of up to $38,500 is available to eligible homeowners for the rehabilitation of thei r homes. This money can be used to address energy efficiencies. Purchase \u00adrehabilitation program. This HAND program provides funds for energy efficiency improvements to incom eeligible families purchasing a home. EverGreen Village. This 12unit subdivision was developed by HAND and incorporates many energyefficient plans. These plans include a storm water design system that incorporates a restored creek and naturalized rain gardens and homes built using LEED standards. These energy efficient designs cou pled with solar energy production make these green homes very efficient and costeffective.191 Furnace insulation program. HAND has plans for furnace insulation and draft assessment programs for both owneroccupied and rental housing units. Conditional loans to developers. Through HAND, loans are provided to developers for construction or rehabilitation of affordable owneroccupied homes. Direct assistance to homebuyers. HAND also provides direct assistance to homeowners to purchase o r rehabilitate homes. South Central Community Action Program (CAP) Weatherization Program. CAP's Weatherization Program assists lowincome households in r educing their energy consumption. Certified technicians use energy audits and diagnostic equipment to enable households to stay comfortable year round a nd save money.192 191 See http://bloomington.in.gov/evergreen for more information. 192 See http://www.sccap.monroe.in.us/ for more information.

Energy efficiency seminars. The City of Bloomington Commission on Sustainability, along with Ener gyPros and Earth Care, host reg ular seminars focusing on home construction and remodeling for energy conser vation. Development \"green\" incentives. The City's Unified Development Ordinance offers a number of \"green\" incentives to residential and other developers to encourage conservation and greater efficiency. To date, few de velopers have utilized such incentives. The incentives include: Energy and resource efficiency . Features that meet the energy and resource efficiency goal include green roofs, improved building performance rating, the use of nonpolluting and/or renewable onsite energ y sources, recycling and/or salvaging at least 50 percent of nonhazardous construct ion and demolition debris, or utilizing building materials and products sourced within a 500mile radius. Landscape and site design. Qualifying designs inclu de the use of at least 25 percent permeable pavement, utilization of natural vegetation a nd other techniques to convey and filter storm water, employment of systems to recycle at least 50 percent of greywater and storm water, retention of 90 percent of area tree canopy, and/or conservation of land with a slope of 12 percent or greater. Public policy . Public policy commitments include incorporating mixed use development, providing 100 percent of the required long term bi cycle parking spaces, decreasing automobile parking while increasing bicycle parking, and providing subsidized Bloomington Transit passes or a private va n or shuttle. Public transportation . Qualifying projects are located near a transit stop, activity center, downtown, public school or park, or multiuse t rail.193 State incentives. The State of Indiana offers a n umber of incentives to homeowners for efficiency improvements. These incentives are detailed in the Opportunities for Citizen Action chapter of this Report. While the abovelisted incentives are a good start, peak energy will require us to do much more to prepare for everincreasing costs of electricity and na tural gas. 193 Unified Development Ordinance, \u00a720.05.049. http://bloomington.in.gov/documents/viewDocument.php?document_id=267 Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 160VULNERABILITIES 1. Potential for power grid failure in peak oil scenarios. \"Peak energy\" - oil, coal and gas shortages - will translate in to the potential for grid failure. As Clifford Wirth points out in Peak Oil: Alternatives, Renewables, and Impacts, \"The power grid for most of North America will fail due to a lack of spare parts and maintenance for the 257,000 kilometers of electric power transmission lines, hundre ds of thousands of pylons (which are transported on the hi ghways), and hundreds of power generating plants and substations, as well as from shor tages in the supply of coal, n atural gas, or oil used in generating electric power. Power failures could also result from the residential use of electric stoves and space heaters when there are shortages of o il and natural gas for home heating. This would overload the power grid, causing its failur e.\"194 In the event of long term grid failure, \"homes across the U.S. will lack heating and air conditioning. Even if homes are retrofitted with wood s toves, local biomass is insuff icient to provide for home heating, and it will not be possi ble to cut, split, and move wo od in sufficient quantities.\"195 Given the coalsourced nature of electricity in Indiana and th e expected increased pressure on the grid, we must anticipate that the electric power grid wi ll become greatly compromised and could experi ence a number of failures.196 194 Clifford Wirth, Peak Alternatives, Renewables, and Impacts, July 2008, 4647 195 Wirth, 48 196 From report from the UK Industr y Task Force on Peak Oil & Ener gy Security, The Oil Crunch: Securing the UK's Energy Future (October 2008). http://peakoil.solarcentury.com/ wpcontent/uploads/2008/10/oil report final.pdf Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 161 2. Housing will occupy an ever\u00adincreasing proportion of personal income. The Transportation chapter illustrated the way in which increasing oil prices wil l consume more and more of personal income . The story is the same with h ousing. Absent efficiency improvements, heating, maintenance, and monthly housing costs will consume a larger share of household budgets and may push people toward lower quality housing choices at the same time that auto transportation costs increase dramatically. 3. Big houses and low occupancy translates into great inefficiency. As described above, Bloomington residents, like most Americans, tend to live in lar ge spaces with few occupants. As fuel becomes scarcer and electricity prices rise, it will become increasingly difficult to heat and cool these large spac es. Many families will likely face tough choices such as downs izing to a more moderatelysize d space, doubling up households, closing off unused rooms and/or remodeling underutilized areas to create living space for additional household members who can contribut e to the cost of utilities and maintenance. It is likely th at large and inefficient homes will not hold their worth and those who have their net worth t ied up in such houses may be di sproportionately affected. 4. No incentives for landlords to make rental units energy efficient. For the most part, when renters assume the cost of their utilit y bills, landlords don't have much financial incentive to make their rentals more energy effi cient. This is known as a \"split incentive.\" Owners don't make efficiency investments bec ause it's the renters who pay the energy bills. And renters don't make investments in pro perty they don't own. The result is housing that wastes en ergy and costs more than it should. Since fully 65% of all housing units in Bloomington are renteroccupied, renters livin g in inefficient units will face considerable hardship due to peak oil. Source: Natural Resources Defense CouncilReport of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 162 5. Restrictive covenants on use of clotheslines. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, 5.8 percent of resi dential electricity use goes towards the use of clothes dryers.197 Many residents are subject not only to state and local laws regarding their property, but also to t he rules attached to their property by way of covenants and rules of homeowners' associations. Several Bloomington neighborhoods have such covenants against the placement or use of clotheslines. Whether or not such rules are enforced by the neighborhood, now is the time to change the stigm a against clotheslines. 6. Lack of retrofitting expertise in community. If the residents of Bloomington and Monroe County were persuaded to make the sorts of deep changes in their homes and habits that seem to be necessary for survival in a postpetroleum world, it is questionable whether there ar e enough people in the communit y with the knowledge and skills to help us figure out what to do. Many services are currently offered in this area, such as home energy audits, site assessments for renewable ener gy, landscaping design, and basic home improvements.198 However, once a homeowner has completed the basics of sealing air leaks, insulating, a nd replacing windows, there are few who know how to assess a particular site and advise how to take it to the next level t o address questions such as: Should I install a south\u00ad facing window? Build a water storage tank? Add thickness to the walls? Plant a shade tree? 197 U.S. DOE, Energy Information Administration, U.S. Household Electricity Report , http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/reps/enduse/er01_us.html . 198 A list of local green building experts is provided by the City's Environmental Commission at: http://bloomington.in.gov/greenbuildinglocalresources While clotheslines save energy and money, some local neighborhoods ban the use of a clothesline. Source: Michael Jastremski, Wikimedia Commons Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 163 MITIGATION GOALS & STRATEGIES SHORT\u00ad TERM (1\u00ad5 Years) 1. Conserve energy. The first step in reducing vulnerability to power grid failure is to conserve. It's estimated that 50% of household electricity use in the U.S. is simply wasted; we can make huge improvements merely by identifying the points of waste and eliminating them. 199 As Greg Pahl observes: conservation is the least expensive strategy we have available and the least harmful to the environment. . . .[R]eductions can be achieved t hrough a combination of initiatives, including the use of energyefficie nt building materials, appliances, and other technologies, coupled with ima ginative thinking about living better with less.200 Tips for energy conservation are widelyavailable and include t hose offered by the City's Environmental Commission on its Bloomington Environmental Quality Indicators (BEQI) webpage, \"EnergySaving Tips.\"201 Residents can reduce energy costs by 1050% by implementing relatively simple e nergysavings measures. (Please see Opportunities for Citizen Action .) 199 Grant Smith, Executive Director of Citizens Action Coalition, personal communication, November 15, 2008. 200 Greg Pahl, The Citizen\u00adPowered Energy Handbook: Community Solutions to a Global Crisis (Chelsea Green River Publishing Company: White River Junction, VT, 2007), 29. 201 Bloomington Environmental Commission, Bloomington Environmental Quality Indicators Report , http://bloomington.in.gov/documents/viewDocument.php?document_id=2987 Source: U.S. EPAReport of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 1642. The community should explore the possibility of local power generation from renewable sources. As of 2008, there were 72 cities i n Indiana which had municipal lygenerated power utilities.202 Generating energy from renewable sources such as the landfill or wastewater treatment facilities is discussed in the Municipal Services chapter. Local power generation obtained from renewable sources will become critical when power from conventional (centralized, coalbased) sources becomes problematic. Local p ower generation also has the added benefit of diversifying the local economy and creatin g jobs. 3. Establish a revolving fund in HAND to offer loans to homeowners for installation of renewable energy. As the grid becomes evermore tax ed and unreliable, household p roduction of energy will afford residents a degree of energy security. HAND's current ho me rehabilitation programs are federally funded and do not i nclude the installation of ren ewable energy such as solar panels. The City should establish a revolving fund to be administered by HAND for providing lowinterest loans to incomeeligible residents to install renewable energy systems. 203 4. New residential construction should both: a) meet strict energy requirements and b) tend toward a smaller size. All new homes should be both more energy efficient and smaller. Passive solar homes, smaller homes, and granny fla ts should be encouraged. 202 Indiana Municipal Electric Association, http://www.imea.com . 203 For example, the Berkeley City Council has enacted a plan in w hich homeowners can apply for a municipal loan of up to $22,000 to help pay for the upfront costs of inst alling a solar energy system. http://solar.calfinder.com/blog/news/berkeleyfinalizessolarl endingprogram/ Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 165 Passive solar houses In addition to being oriented properly to take advantage of the sun, passive solar houses are wellinsulated and feature an airtight building envelope. 204 The walls are 19inches thick, compared to the standard 3.5inch thickness of typical U S homes. These houses are built with extremely high performance objectives: to reduce energy use 90% in new construction and 80% in existing buildings. 205 A passive solar house is designed to make use of the sun's energy for heat and light, but unlike active solar heatin g systems, passive design doesn't involve the use of mecha nical and electrical devices, s uch as pumps, fans, or electrical controls to move the solar heat .206 204 U.S. Department of Energy, Passive Solar Home Design, http://www.energysavers.gov/your_ home/designing_remodeling/inde x.cfm/mytopic=10250 205 Murphy, 155 206 Supra note 202. Source: U.S. DOE, http://www.eere.ene rgy.gov/de/passive_solar_design.html Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 166 Granny flats In Bloomington, there has been vocal opposition to granny flats or accessory dwelling units (ADUs).207 An ADU is a self contained apartment in an ow neroccupied, singlefamily home or on a lot that is either attached to the principal dwelling or in a separate structure on the same property. The flat might be a suite above a rear detached garage, above the main floor of a house or detached from the principal dwelling like a garden flat. While some residents have concerns about such structures, ADUs have been shown to increase the community's supply of affordable housing and enhan ce the social stability and mix of neighborhoods with little or no negative impact on the p hysical character of the neighborhood.208 ADUs also help to maximize use of existing public infrastruct ure and reduce the pressure on open space and farmlands from sprawling development. As there is considerable community concern regarding allowing granny flats, the City should engage in greater public awareness regardin g the benefits of granny flats . Micro houses Micro houses are extreme ly small houses with a maximum area of 500 square feet. 209 While these houses may not be suited for everyone, as household energy prices rise, more residents might find smaller houses more attractive. It should be noted that, for safety purposes, the Indiana Residential Code requires that every dwelling unit shall have at least one habitable room that shall have not less than 120 square feet. 210 207 Brady Gilliham, \"City Plan Commi ssion Votes Down Granny Flats,\" Herald Times, May 5, 2009, p.

Establish a plan for retrofitting 5% of existing city housing stock per year. While it is important that new homes are as efficient as possible, it saves even more energy to ensure that existing homes are as energy efficient as possible. This could be accomplished by major efforts su ch as reducing home size, thickening the building's envelope, and moving heating and ductwork within conditioned space. 211 However, it would also be accomplished by relatively simple measures such as installing more efficient light bulbs, addressing leaks, putting up heavier drapes, and s witching out appliances. The City should work with community partners to outline a plan to retrofit 5% of the existing owner\u00adoccupied and rental housing stock each year, starting at least by 2014, if not earlier. 6. Establish an Alternative Technology Advisory Committee. Since many ideas for energy effi ciency will involve uncommon te chniques or materials, it may be helpful for the City and County to work together to foll ow the lead of Portland in establishing an Alternative Technology Advisory Committee . This committee is made up of experts in sustainable technolog ies and emerging construction t echniques who help building officials evaluate new technologies. A builder wishin g to use an emerging, sustainable technology may submi t an application to the committ ee along with any available test data, case studies, or relevant information that shows how the technology can meet the building code. The committee evaluates and advises sta ff regarding innovative designs and construction methods. 212 211 Murphy, 157. 212 See http://www.portlandonline.com/bds/index.cfm?c=48661 . Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 1687. Actively work to grow building efficiency expertise in the community. With the current economic condit ions unfavorable to home constr uction, there are likely to be many people with knowledge of buildings who might be interes ted in training to become home performance speciali sts. Home assessment training is typically a weeklong intensive program, costing $1,2 00 $2,500. The City and other community stakeholders should explore whether it might be possible to help subsidize t he cost of some of this training for local residents. In return, trainees could promise to conduct a certain number of free or reducedrate home assessments for lowincome residen ts and/or nonprofit organizations, once they are certified213. 8. Promote green mortgages. The City should work with local banks to promote Energy Efficient (EEM) and Energy Improvement Mortgages (EIM). EEMs are mortgages that credit a h ome's energy efficiency in the mortgages themselves, while EIMs allow borrowers to incl ude the cost of energy efficiency improvements to an existing home in the mortgage without increasing the down payment. EIMs allow the borrower to use the money saved in util ity bills to finance energy improvements.214 9. Implement incentives to make rental units more energy efficient. In an effort to address the \"split incentive\" dilemma, the City should think through ways it might encourage landlords to make rentals more efficient. A num ber of local governments have implemented programs either to provide reimbursements to l andlords who weatherize their rental units or to allow tenants to allot a po rtion of their rent to efficiency improvements. 213 Such training is offered by organizations such as Indianapolisbased Energy Efficient Homes Institute, Inc., http://www.bpi.org/con tent/home/index.php . 214 See Energy Star, What is an Energy Efficient Mortgage ? http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=bldrs_lenders_raters.ener gy_efficient_mortgage Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 169In helping the City devise incen tives, the following examples may prove instructive: Chicago's \"Repair and Deduct\" program The \"Repair and Deduct\" program allows tenants to deduct half o f one month's rent annually to spend on improvements of their choice.215 The New York Energy $mart Multifamily Performance Program This program targets the operati onal efficiencies of multifami ly buildings by engaging a partner network made up of engineers, energy consult ants, and other industry professionals. Elig ible buildings are required t o benchmark their energy performance compared to a set of similar buildings. Depending on their relative rank, they are assigned a performance target to achieve. If the building meets its target, the owner is eligible for fun ding. The goals of this program include: saving thousands of dollars a year on ene rgy costs, improving the value of the building and providing tenants with a comfortable and affordable living environment. 216 Minnesota \u00ad Rental Energy Loan Fund Program This program provides lowinterest fiveyear loans to landlord s to improve the efficiency of their rentals. The program is not restricted to lowincome owners and covers a wide range of efficiency improvements for a property. Borrowers must have at least onethird interest in the propert y, or be purchasing it through a mortgage or contract for deed.217 215 Chicago Residential Landlord and Tenant Ordinance, 512110(c); See also Chicago Metropolitan Tenants Organization, Chicago Tenants Rights Pamphlets (English #2 of 3); http://www.tenant.net/Other_Areas/Illinois/mto/english2.html#Re nt%20Withholding%20%20and%20Re pair%20and%20Deduct 216 New York State Energy Researc h and Development Authority, http://getenergysmart.org/MultiFamilyHomes/ExistingBuilding/Bui ldingOwner.aspx 217 Center for Energy and the Environment, http://www.mncee.org/pr ograms_residential/r ental_rehab_financin g/rental_energy_loan_fund/index.php Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 17010. Educate and motivate citizens to change habits. As Pat Murphy points out, \"Chang ing habits is as important as c hanging infrastructure.\"218 In addition to making citizens aw are of energytechniques, such as those outlined in the Opportunities for Citizen Action section of this Report, below are several strategies that may be useful in helping people unde rstand the need to make changes and learn how to make them. Launch an \"Efficiency Pioneers\" Program The City should create an Efficiency Pioneers program. Partici pants in the program would undergo a home energy audit subsidized by the City in order to discover best ways to drastically reduce utility use. Parti cipating households would hold regular openhouse or neighborhood events showcasing their efforts. All efficiency modifications should b e well documented and publicized. Part of the cost of the program mig ht be underwritten by area businesses (home assessors, lumber yards, building suppliers, architects, and contractors). The City should sponsor an energy conservation competition. Community stakeholders such as Indiana University and the South ern Indiana Renewable Energy Network (SIREN) have conducted or init iated energy conservation competitions with great success.219 The City should expand this effort by sponsoring an energy conservation competi tion for the citizens of Bloomington. The goals of the competition would be to demonstrate how easy it is to re duce consumption and to create permanent community habits. Throughout the competition, the City should publicize the effor t widely. The City could partner with efficien cy experts to sponsor efficienc y workshops and webinars. Newspaper feature stories, film festivals and an energy efficiency display in the atrium of City Hall could be part of the outreach effort. Winners could be awarded a solar panel or some other component of a renewable energy system, reinfor cing the concept that renewable energy makes sense only after reducing energy use as much as possible. 218 Murphy, 1623. 219 IU's effort is known as a yearl y \"Energy Challenge\" while SIR EN's effort is known as an \"Energy Showdown.\" Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 171 \"Energy savings accounts\" Ideally, people would implement the easiest and least expensive conservation strategies first, and then apply the money saved t oward more expensive projects. However, it is easy for money not spent on utility bills to be spent somewhere else, so that the larger projects always sta y just out of reach. \"Energy savings accounts\" would circumvent that problem with the help of local banks. A customer would set up an energy savings account with her or h is local bank. A baseline utility use wo uld be established, along with a direct payment program. Each month, the customer would pay her or his baseline utility rate to the bank, which would then pay the actual amoun t owed to the utilities. The difference, presu mably saved by conservation and other changes, goes into the customer's energy savings account, where it is saved for future home efficiency improvements, renewable energy proje cts, and so on. (If utility use increased, some provision would need to be in place for the customer to pay the additional a mount.) Perhaps it would be possible to negotiate a special interest rate or a matching funds program f or those who participate. MEDIUM \u00adTERM (5\u00ad15 Years) 1. Approximately half of the City's housing stock should be retrofitted for energy efficiency within the next 15 years (by 2024). LONG\u00adTERM (15\u00ad30 Years) 1. Close to 100% of the City's housing stock should be retrofitted for energy efficiency within the next 30 years (by 2039). Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 172SUSTENANCE: FOOD, WATER, WASTE & HEALTH CARE \"Sustenance\" can be understood as the maintenance and nurturanc e of health and life. The elements of sustenance include: food, water, waste handling, an d health care. At present, these elements are centrally provided by private companies, government, and publicly owned corporations and are entirely dependent on petroleum. In a medical model, Bloomington is on \"lifesupport,\" with the wellbeing of its re sidents largely dependent on a source of energy that is widely expected to contract within the next five to 15 years. To prepare for this contraction, sustenance for Bloomington's citizens in a lowenergy future must derive significantly from the resources of the household and from forests and farms within the city and its su rrounding region. The distance most food travels from field to table will shrink dramatically . The distribution of food fo r sale must also move closer to consumers who can be expected to travel less by car and more on foot, bicycle, and public transit in the future. The proce ss of providing for our own dai ly needs while reducing our reliance on fossil fuels is the essence of building community r esilience. We expect that it will take decades to achieve levels of selfreliance comparable to those enjoyed by Indiana communities a century ago, so we must outlin e and prioritize those actions which will address our gr eatest vulnerabilities first. The path to community self reliance will require the recovery of old skills, the propagati on of new skills, and the reorganization of public and pri vate infrastructure within the Bloomington community. Public agencies have an important role to play in catalyzing an d nurturing this transformation. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 173 FOOD Eating Oil Over the last 100 years, the way we feed ourselves has changed radically. Chiefly from the use of pesticides, herbicides, f ertilizers, and mechanization, agricultural production over the last century has more that t ripled. However, the modern fo od system is both highly centralized and almost entirely dependent on oil. It relies on oil both for production and for transportation from farm to table. Indeed, little more than 2 percent of the food we eat comes from local sources. Our f ood travels thousands of miles on average, most of it is carried by dieselpowered trucks.220 As Bloomington consumers, we complete deliveries to the kitchen by commuting from our homes to half a dozen shoppin g hubs at major traffic junctures to the north, south, e ast, and west of the city cente r. This system of production and consumption is a very energy intensive one. Approximately 7.3 calories of fossil energy go into harvesting and serving up one calorie of solarderived food energy. 221 Of this total, 1.6 calories go into farm operations, transport requires 1.0 calorie, processing and packaging require 1.7 calories, retail sales and food service 0.8 calories, and household level storage and preparati on 2.3 calories. Most Americans are literally eating oil and gas (and not a little coal). 220 It is fair to assume that Bloomington foodmiles do not differ that much from the national average. Produce in the U.S. travels, on averag e, 1300 2000 miles from farm to consumer. 221 Richard Heinberg and Michael Bomford, The Food and Farming Transition: Toward a Post\u00adCarbon Food System, Post Carbon Institute, 2009. http://www.postcarbon.org/food Source: Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 174 Indeed, it is estimated that the U.S. food system uses 17 perce nt of the total energy consumed in the nation each year - about 10 barrels of oil equi valent per person.222 Packaging 0.5 calorieFood Retail 0.3 calorieCommercial Food Service 0.5 calorie Household Storage & Preparation 2.3 calories Farming 1.6 caloriesTransport 1 calorieProcessing 1.2 calories Energy Used to Yield One Food Calorie.223 The U.S. American food system uses 7.3 calories to produce and deliver one calorie of food energy. 222 Pat Murphy, Plan C: Community Survival Strategies for Peak Oil and Climate Change.

Keoleian, Life Cycle\u00adBased Sustainability Indicators for Assessment of the U.S. Food System, University of Michigan (2000). Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 175VULNERABILITIES: Daily Bread The vulnerabilities inherent in our current welloiled way of f eeding ourselves are manifold. Some of the more obvious threats to Bloomington's fo od security due to peak oil include: 1. Increased food prices due to fuel\u00adrelated cost hikes affecting production, processing, and transport. 2. Increased food prices and/or shortages due to falling food production resulting from energy \u00adrelated shortages of agricultural inputs (fuel, fertilizer, irrigation water). 3. Increased prices, or shortages of grain, cereals, and meat and dairy products due to diversion of grain to ethanol production. 4. Shortages of grain due to increased purchasing by foreign governments (China, India, others) to cover shortfalls in domestic production as a result of energy, climate or land problems. 5. Shortages of food due to spoilage in transit or storage because of power outages due to grid electricity disruptions. 6. Abrupt disruption in fuel supplies due to sudden loss of confidence in the U.S. dollar and a market or political embargo of oil shipments to this country with consequent dislocation of the trucking industry. 7. A trucking strike or shutdown related to fuel price rises and a squeeze on driver incomes. 8. Disruptions to the food supply system due to a lack of credit, bankruptcies, or other financial failures. 9. Less than 2 percent of the food consumed by city residents is produced within the city, its surrounding region or the state. Many of these vulnerabilities are interrelated and are likely t o compound each other. In a world of contracting energy suppl ies, our present food system i s set up to fail. Therefore, it is imperative to begin creating an alternative system free of f ossil fuels by which the city and area residents may be assured their daily bread. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 176 Local Food Production Efforts to promote local food pro duction began more than 30 years ago and continue to grow today. Bloomington and Monro e County are fortunate to have some important elements of a local food system already in place: a large coope rative food merchandiser with three storefronts and many local suppliers, at least one c ommercial orchard, seasonal wild mushroom harvests, heritage animal breeds, two local winer ies, two local breweries, wellorganized food pantries for the indigent, and the most vib rant farmers' market in the state. During the past generation, the coordinated efforts of private citizens, local business, and City government have done a remarkably good job of weaving together many small contributions of food growing to create a fabric of considerable breadth and diversity that has become a regional economic attractor and an anchor for the city's downtown. However, it would be vanity to claim that this is any more th an a small down payment on a local food system. The amount of locallyg rown food sourced even through these many locallyowned and operated outlets is small in comparison to the need. Americans consume an average of about one ton of food per person per year, so Bl oomington's population of about 70,000 eats about 70,500 tons of food per year, or 141,000,000 pounds. 224 Probably less than 2 percent of the food consumed by city residents in 2009 will be grown within Monroe or its immediate neighboring counties, and likely less than 5 percent will be pr oduced within Indiana.225 224 For comparison, Mother Hubbard's Cupboard serves about 1 perce nt of this volume to its clients each year. 225 These estimates are based on obs ervation of produce and other g oods sold in city mark ets, and reasonable extrapolation from published USDA statistics on agricultural pr oduction within the state and region. See Indiana Farm Direct, Fact Sheet http://www.indianafarmdirect.com/resource_g uide/agriculture_tou r.php Kale at local community garden Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 177While more and more people are planting gardens, we could grow substantially more of our own food. It is likely that Bloomington tracks national g ardening trends. Nationwide, approximately 32 percent of house holds have grown gardens. The National Gardening Association estimates that for 2009 that 38 percent of 114 mill ion households will grow food gardens - almost 20 percent more than in 2008.226 While it can be assumed that the portion of settled households ga rdening in our community is sim ilar; the per capita yield from home production in the city is probably less than the national average because such a large portion of Bloomington's population consists of universit y students - temporary landless residents. Though consid erable potential for urban fo od production exists, at present this potential is barely realized in Bloomington. Indeed, most of Indiana's \"agricultural\" production consists of feedstocks for animals or industry in the form of corn and soybeans. Commercial vegetable production within th e State is very modest, averaging less than ten pounds per state resident. Most of this production is concentrated in areas far north and west of Monroe County, with tomatoes, melons, a nd green beans the chief measur able crops. Locallyra ised beef, pork, and lamb can be found in town, but n ot in large quantities, nor in many outlets. There is no dairy in Monroe County. 226 National Gardening Association , Impact of Home and Community Gardening in America Survey, 2009 http://www.gardenresearch.com/files/2009ImpactofGardeningin AmericaWhitePaper.pdf Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 178The Current U.S. Diet Americans eat an average of just under 4,000 calories per perso n per day.227 Using the previouslycited figure that 7.3 calories of fossil energy go i nto harvesting and serving up one calorie of solarderived food energy,228 such consumption translates into about 30,000 calories. This is the equivalent of 45 KWh per person per day, the energy equivalent of 450 gallons of gasoline per year. At present, food energy comes tw othirds from calorieintense f oods (meat, dairy, eggs, fats, and sweeteners) and onethird from nutrientintense foods (fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and legumes).

Thus, Bloomington's current foodshed amounts to 182,000 acres or 285 square miles of productive land distributed across the United States and the rest of the world. The area of Monroe County is 390 square miles, most of which is not agriculturally suitable. On the face of it, Mon roe County could not hope to feed itself. But what does the picture look like if we expand t he territory to include the six counties surrounding Monroe County? 230 Yield figures are derived from commercial averages. 231 Arthur Getz, \"Urban Foodsheds,\" Permaculture Activist, 7(3) (1991). Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 180Regional Land and Population The prime agricultural land in the sevencounty region surround ing Bloomington (Monroe, Brown, Greene, Owen, Lawrence, M organ, and Jackson counties) eq uals 1,232 square miles. While that is enough land to sus tain over four times the popula tion of Bloomington (based on current patterns of consumption and average agricultural yie lds by present methods), it is only enough for about 85 perc ent of the population of the re gion\u2014still not enough prime farmland to feed the sevencounty region a stand ard American di et.

More land may be avai lable for agriculture than is presently indicated by the category, \"prime farmland,\" which is defined by the U.S.D.A. as \"prime and important farmable soils, possibly needing some drai nage or flood protection in some areas, but not requiring largescale amendment, preparation, grading, or terracing to be used as highly productive farmland for a large variety of crops.\" 233 Despite this definition, an examination of th e region's agricultural history paints a more productive picture of the land available to us for food production. 232 Adapted from U.S. Census of Agriculture, 2007. 233 Soil Survey Staff. \"Soil Survey Manual\". Soil Conservation Ser vice. U.S. Department of Agriculture Handbook, 1993. http://soils.usda.gov/technical/ manual/print_version/complete.html . Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 181 Indiana agriculture reached its apex in 1900. In that year, ap proximately 21.6 million acres of the state's 23 million acres w ere in farms and Monroe County had 237,500 acres of its land in farms. By 1930, Monroe County farmland had dropped to 1 91,985 acres due to increased competition from western growers, decline of commodity prices, general economic contraction, and urbanization resulting from economic and social change, with a consequent fall in the r ural population. Of the land in production in 1930, 47,842 acres were harvested cropland and 84,748 were pastured land. While data from earlier periods is obscure, we can assume that at the time of Indiana's agricultural peak in 1900, the same proportions of total farmland were used in crop and pasture as in 1930: 25 percent in crops, 45 percent in pasture and 30 percent in woodland or other uses (or neglect). Thus, as much as 59, 000 acres of Monroe County may at one time have been pla nted in crops, and as much as 107,000 acres may have been in pasture. This deduced figure for cropland in 1900 closely matches the 20 07 Census data for prime farmland. Land farmed and total value of farm production has fallen steadily in the state and region since 1900 and by as much as 25 percent from 1997 to 2002. A reasonable inference from this is that even within the past decade, significantly more land has been used for farming in the sevencounty region than was inventoried in 2007, and that under changed economic conditions, some of that land might be brought into production again. A Monroe County Farm Loss of Prime Farmland Much prime farmland has been lost to development most of it in the 20th century and most of it enabled by the availability of cheap oil. From 19821992, Indiana lost 150,000 acres of farmland to development. Based on population, Monroe County's share of that loss would have been about 2,800 acres. Development continued statewide during the 1990s and early 2000s at a similar rate, but has slowed since 2003, and virtually ceased since 2007. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 182 Can Bloomington Feed Itself? Feeding ourselves is a critical goal. As we saw in the summer of 2008, food prices tend to follow in lock step with oil prices. As discussed previously in this Report , we expect oil prices to increase again. As they do so, some disruptions in the current distribution of food and other goods are likely. One critical way to mitigate the effects of everincreasing food costs is to grow more food locally. In addition to farmland available in the rural areas surrounding the cit y, there are many spaces to grow food within the city itself. Some of these spaces are held by local government, some by IU, and some by private entities. Much productive land is available right in our own backyards. Maximizing the amount of food we produce just within the city has the distinct advantage of reducing the amount of energy it takes to get the food to the people and the people to the food. The greenspace available within the city limits was mapped by t he City's Environmental Commission in 2007. 234 As of the last inventory on July 1, 2007, 6,429 acres of greenspace were available within Bloomington corporate boundaries about 3900 square feet per city 234 City of Bloomington Environmental Commission, Greenspace Trends in Bloomington, 2003\u00ad2007(2007). http://bloomington.in.gov/media/media.php?media_id=2738 Potatoes at the Bloomington Community Farmers' Marke t Source: Daniel Orr Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 183 resident. Of this, 1,222 acres were held by Indiana University, 1,376 acres were controlled by Parks and Recreation, and 3,8 31 acres were in private hands. In addition, over 3,500 acres of the city are zoned singlefamily residential. Even if all this residential land is developed, then at least 2,500 of the 3,500 residential acres n ot covered with buildings or pavement might be made suitable for gardening, adding an additi onal 1,400 square feet per city resident. Therefore, appr oximately 5,300 square feet of open ground are presently available in Bloomington per city resident. To place these numbers in pe rspective, John Jeavons, author of How to Grow More Vegetables Than You Ever Thought Possible on Less Land Than You Can Imagine,235 has clearly demonstrated that enough food can be produced to support o ne adult for one year on 4,000 square feet without compromising nutritional requirements. Jeavon's approach is a biointensive one which focuses on maximum yields from a minimum area of land while simultaneously improving the soil. This approach suggests that enough land exists, even within the corporate boundary of Bloomington, to provide a basic, albeit primarily vegetarian, diet to all city residents. In assessing the present and futu re capacity of Bloomington to feed itself, many factors must be taken into account. First of all, under conditions of f ood price increase and shortage, people are strongly mo tivated to consider alternative s to their present modes of eating and sourcing food. This was the case in Cuba during the Special Period of 199194. During this period, oil supplies plummeted and mechanized agric ulture ground to a halt. As a result, residents in Havana and other cities planted just about every available square foot of land and adopted a diet which included approximately 85 percent less meat. The 235 John Jeavons, How to Grow More Vegetables Than You Ever Thought Possible on Less Land Than You Can Imagine (Berkeley: Ten Speed Press, rvsd. ed., 1991). Example of biointensive gardens. Source: www.home\u00ad farming.com Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 184population maintained health, while critical groups (pregnant w omen and children especially) received extra rations. Under conditions of food shortag e, Bloomingtonians would likely be similarly motivated to increase local food production by gardening, and could be expec ted to accept significant changes to dietary habits. A modi fied American diet that incorp orated relatively easy adjustments would serve about 87 percent of the weight of food of the present diet and would more than meet World Healt h Organization a verage daily nu tritional needs while requiring substantially less land\u2014about 1.85 acres per person. (See table, following page). Such a modified diet would: eliminate most caloric sweeteners (substituting smaller amounts of honey, maple syrup, and sorghum syrup\u2014all locally sourced sugars); reduce the amount of fats and oi ls by 60 percent while doubling the volume of nuts and seeds; reduce dairy consumption by about onethird; provide twofifths of the meat consumed today; add about seven times as many beans and legumes; and add about 50 percent more grain, flour and cereals. This diet assumes no change in f arming practices or land intensity of production, though under such constraints, these would likely also shift. It is reasonable to conclude tha t the land base of the sevencounty region surrounding Bloomington is more than adequate to produce the amount of food needed to sustain the present population of the area in a state of health. Indeed, a reduction in fats, caloric sweeteners, red meat, and the substitution of whole grains and flours for denatured cereal, plus the substitution of smaller amounts of wild game and other locally harvested wild foods such as mushrooms for ocean fish now eaten would likely i mprove health. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 185A Locally\u00adGrown Diet The diet suggested above is one that is based on familiar foods and is roughly the same volume and calories per person as current average consumption. This diet, and the land required to maintain it, is detailed below.

What would be its sources of fertility in the absence of most c hemical nitrates and phosphates? Leguminous and other cover crops would need to be grown in rotations, especially in shoulder and cold seasons to the extent possible. A larger population of livestock would be needed to exploit available pasture land and to provide adequate meat even for a lowercalorie diet. C omposted offal and animal remai ns from local slaughterhouses, plus human and other animal manures, would nee d to be recaptured for Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 186fertility inputs and yields of surplus biomass would need to be harvested from non croplands throughout the region. Assuming that most of the 60 percent of the region's land area not in prime farmland is wo oded or could be sown to compost crops, it is likely that a regenerative agricultural system for the region could be design ed and implemented given sufficient cooperation and willingness. Of course, the best inn ovative techniques for soil fertility management and biointensive production should be empl oyed. Yet, even without these potential improvements to productivity, it seems likely t hat the region could feed itself if other factors of production could be mobilized. Factors Which Moderate Food Demand While we've determined that the agricultural land base of Bloomington's sevencounty region is sufficient to provide Bloomington and its neighbors with a healthy diet, we've come to this conclusion in light of the following factors which moderate local food demand. 1. Many students at Indiana University and other area colleges depart the region for travel, study, or to return home to family during breaks, reduc ing by several percentage points the food requi rements of the area. In the eve nt that food shortages emerge as a chronic social condition, the resident po pulation may be reduced as students seek refuge with their families in other parts of the state or the nation. 2. The American diet is widely acknowledged to be excessive and most people could live better and longer on somewhat less food. Sugars and bad fats could be reduced with an expected increase in health, and perhaps less hunger, a s these empty calories often strip the body of nutrients and leave it craving even more food. 3. Much less meat and dairy in the diet could be anticipated i n the event of extreme conditions. Price increases for these energy and landintensiv e foods will tend to reduce consumption, even absent shortages. This change alone wo uld dramatically reduce the amount of land requir ed to feed the regional populat ion of 350,000. 4. Conventional American agricu lture uses little labor but muc h land, energy, and capital. Home gardening produces 27 times as much food per acre as commercial farming. Jeavons' biointensive gardening methods produce 11 tim es the fruits and vegetables per unit of land as c onventional American agriculture. (Indeed, using Jeavons' method, Jules Dervaes a nd his family raise 6,000 lbs. of food annually on Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 187onefifth of an acre in Pasadena, California.)236 In conclusion, arable land avail able within the City of Bloomin gton alone (as much as 8,000 acres, or upwards of 5,0 00 square feet per resident) is potentially sufficient to meet most of the vegetable, fr uit, egg, and some poultry req uirements of city residents were it to be cultivat ed to the maximum extent possib le using the most productive and intensive gardenscale methods. 236 http://www.pathtofreedom.com/a bout/urbanhomestead.shtml Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 188 MITIGATION GOALS & STRATEGIES: PLANTING SEEDS While Bloomington may be a long way from achieving selfreliance in food - and indeed may never be required to be completely self sufficient - we should begin now to increase all forms of food production, processing, and storage in an effort to build community resilience. The shortterm goals and strategies presented here aim to mobilize the community to begin self provisioning. These rec ommendations are also intended to change attit udes so as to make both legitimate and preferabl e the idea of a locally centered food system and to set in place infrastructure and launch initiatives that will make possible a rapid expansion of loc al capacity in the medium term. In 30 years, the aim of these recommendations is to realize a significant level of loca l selfreliance for the Bloomington region, thereby ensur ing the wellbeing and food se curity of the citizenry. These initiatives should be unde rstood as innovative, experimen tal, and aimed at preparing the ground for a much larger eff ort to follow. Empirical feedba ck and rapid incorporation of new learning must be integral to the work. This process will de pend to a great deal on the support of the public sector and on the willingness of private citizens to share their knowledge and discoveries. The community - and local government especially - can aid this process by exhortation and encouragement. The rewards of l ocal food production are potentially substantial: improved nutrition and health, a more beautiful and productive environment, less waste, enhance d food security, and a new basi s for local industry and commerce. With this greater selfsufficiency, we can also hope for an increase in sociability and prosperity in our neighborh oods and for stronger households and families. Photo: Cheryl DeWolfe, Wikimedia Commons Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 189Toward Greater Local Food Production The recommendations which follow are based on these principles: 1) Enlist private sector cooperation; 2) Advocate for local food produ ction and increase access to re levant information to support food production and processing; 3) Remove or reduce legal, institutional, and cultural barrier s to farming within and around the city, and open in stitutional markets to local fo od; 4) Reserve open land for agriculture and make additional land available for food production; 5) Create and expand local food processing and distribution sy stems; 6) Organize direct support by th e city and other public agenci es to address infrastructure needs for water supply, fertility collection and distribution, food processing, storage, and marketing; and 7) Create specific forms of su pport for new farmers, including training, land access, lowcost startup loans, and property tax abatements or land rent offsets. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 190 SHORT\u00ad TERM STRATEGIES (1\u00ad5 Years) In the interest of increasing all forms of food production with in and around the city such that the city achieves 20 percent selfprovision in vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, and small animal proteins, the following is recommended:237 1. Create a community food security plan. Work closely with the private sector and Indiana University to outline a detailed plan for community food security, using this Report as guidance. 2. The City should plant edible landscapes on public property. The City of Bloomington's Parks and Recreat ion Department already does a g reat job of fostering a few community garde ns and a burgeoning orchard thr ough its Community Gardens initiative. T he City should expand these ef forts substantially and plant edible public landscapes along streets, in parks and surrounding public buildings, especially City Hall. For example, North Vancouver is considering a plan to create edible boulevards. The idea is to bring food production within social s p a c e s . 3. Organize City\u00ad led horticultural services to include organic waste collection, processing, and distribution. Create a City nursery to supply edible perennials to the Cit y's Parks and Recreation and Street Departments; Work to establish perennial f ood forests on public land by grafting and planting fruit and nut trees; Institute an urban forestry and composting program to harvest t he carbon flow through the city and compost it for growers. (e.g., cardb oard, hair f rom salons, pre and postcons umer food waste, brush trimming s); Promote homescale compost ing of kitchen wastes; Create a City arboretum of economic species; and Establish additional seed bank ing facilities in Bloomington. 237 Based on the modified diet discussed above, this would comprise about 200 lbs./perso n of food\u2014or about 14 million pounds in the aggregate, per year. Under consideration: edible boulevards in North Vancouver. Source: Green Skin Labs Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 1914. Expand water storage within the city to support agriculture. 5. Subsidize the cost of materials and education for building a resilient infrastructure. To start, establish: farm stands or agricultural parks in areas of greatest populati on density and activity; food storage systems at schools; and grants for neighborhood associatio ns to be used for rainwater catchment tanks, root cellars, an d neighborhoodbased food busi nesses 6. Adopt a Food Security Resolution. The resolution should affirm that \"Everyone has the right to ad equate, healthful, nourishing food appropriate to their cultural and physical requirements.\" 7. Establish Bloomington as a Slow Food City . A Slow Food City supports local food production and processing that is good, cl ean, and fair and that aims to effect lasting change in the food sys tem.238 Locallygrown food and locallybased cuisine s hould be incorporated into the Lotus Festival and at least one other showcase event o r location, preferably in connection with Indiana University. 8. Food security should figure prominently in the City's new Sustainable City Initiative . The City should use the Initiati ve's website to anchor a web pr esence for information related to local food production, processing, and m arketing. 239 9. Through education and funding, work to increase food storage in Bloomington household and community pantries to three months supply for all residents\u2014 about 18,000 tons aggregate. 238 See further, Slow Food USA. http://slowfoodusa.org/index.php 239 http://bloomington.in.gov/documents/viewDocument.php?document_i d=2121 Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 192 10. Train and deploy 300 new urban garden farmers. Toward this end, the City should: Intensify its practical food production arts classes via People 's University; Work with Ivy Tech for vocational training in smallscale or ganic farming; Lend support to efforts at Monroe County School Corporation (MCCSC) schools to launch gardening programs; Request Monroe County Public Library to increase its holding s of relevant literature and media; and Work with the State of Indian a and other stakeholders to cre ate specific forms of support for new farmers , including training, land acce ss, lowcost startup loans and property tax abatements or land rent offsets . Volunteers harvesting at Banneker Community GardenReport of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 19311. Remove or reduce legal, institutional, and cultural barriers to farming within and around the city, and open institutional markets to local food. Increase the number and scale of community garden plots; Promote local food to Monroe County Community School Corpora tion, Bloomington Hospital, Ivy Tech, and IU; Make solar access for passive e nergy capture and food produc tion a limited right of all city homeowners; and Amend the City's Unified Development Ordinance (UDO). The City Council took an important step forward in fostering urban agriculture with its recent amendment to the UDO to allow commu nity gardens and urban agriculture in residential zones of the city. Urban agriculture allows the growing o f food crops through plant cult ivation and includes such activities such as : gardens (front, back and/or side yard), edible landscapes, rooftop gardens, berry patches, and other ac tivities. This amendment does not permit animal husbandry. The UDO should be further amended in the following ways: \u0083 Urban gardening and community g ardens should be permitted in all zones of the city, not just residential zones; \u0083 At present, livestock are only p ermitted in Residential Estate [RE] zones of the city. Animal husbandry should be permitted in all residential zones and appropriat e nonresidential zones. Resid ential zones might be limited to smalle r animals such as chickens, goa ts, rabbits and bees while bigger lots should be permitted to harbo r any livestock; and \u0083 The only exception to the citywide prohibition against animal husbandry is the \"chicken ordina nce.\" The ordinance allows res idents in RE and RS zones to keep n o more than five hens if all their adjacent neighbors waive the general proh ibition against chickens in these zones. Furthermore, the ordinance requires a prospective chick en harborer obtain a permit and pay a fee. Permits are only good for one year and are conditioned upon an inspection by the City's Anima l Care and Control Department. Not onl y does this create significant hurdles for residents wishing to raise c hickens, but it also creates a significant administrative burden for the Ci ty. As more and more residents turn to growing and raising their own food, the burden will only increase. The City should eliminate its pr otracted waiver, permitting, fe e and inspection system and permit all citizens in residential zones to keep chickens. The enforcement of the provision should shift to a complaintbased system where pro blems of noise, odor, and other nuisance are addressed only after they arise. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 194 12. The City and other stakeholders should work to establish food\u00ad business incubator programs with access to community kitchens. 13. The City should dedicate at least 200 acres of public land to intensive gardening and farming within city limits and identify an additional 500 acres for future use. 14. The City should work to increase the area available for year \u00adround growing (covered or greenhouse space) to 200,000 square feet (just under 5 acres). The community should increase local food marketing and processing ten\u00adfold - from an estimated 1\u00ad2 percent of local consumption to between 10\u00ad20 percent. Toward that end, the City should : 15. Identify and zone appropriately a food processing and distribution hub in each of the city's 55 Natural Neighborhood districts (See Map D, p. 101). 16. Permit transitional uses in these districts to bring these hubs into existence. For example, these hubs could be outdoors initially, then be co vered and then eventually add indoor space. The hubs could begin with buying clubs, becoming neighborhoodrun food coops that evolve to storefront commerci al operations. 17. Inventory commercial \u00adrated kitchens within the city and identify unused capacity. 18. Launch at least one food\u00adprocessing business incubator. 19. Acquire and make available to local animal farmers at least two mobile abattoirs for safe and economic local processing of poultry and other meat animals. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 195 20. Work toward a year\u00adround regional farmers' market . Begin working to realize a regio nal farmers' market/food hub th at provides year round facilities for covered sta ll and indoor stall sales by lo cal and regional producers. Such a market should provide adequate public access and facilities for receipt and processing of farms cale loads of produce, on a sca le at least ten times larger than the present Bloomington Community Farmers' Market in Showers Plaza. The regional market should include indoor market space and shop space for food brokerage, processing, an d other related businesses. In the interest of a regional ma rket, the City and community pa rtners should: \u00be Identify an appropriate location; \u00be Seek state support and other funding (private, county, charitab le); and \u00be Consider creating a taxfunding district to channel revenues. 21. Map a strategy to harvest, compost or otherwise process and recycle to soil 100 percent of the city's organic waste. 22. In cooperation with other stakeholders, the City should work toward the establishment of a local land trust for the banking of farmland and the acquisition and holding of development rights to preserve open space for future farm development, and to coordinate a program of placing new farmers on such land. Farmer at the Bloomington Community Farmers' Marke t Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 19623. Reserve open land for agriculture and make additional land available for food production. Specifically the community should: Inventory existing farmable land within the city, county, and r egion; Ban suburbantype development within the City's corporate bound ary; Shift development focus to brownfield sites and increase density in areas with good services and transit (See Land Use chapter); Rezone planned greenfield develo pments to include largerscale agriculture; Provide incentives for househol ds to establish mini farms where appropriate; Support the establishment or dire ction of regional land trusts to hold farmland for longterm l ease and usufruct; and Discourage the conversion of golf courses, sports fields, or ot her large tracts of open land to development. Instead, reserve them for future food production. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 197 MEDIUM \u00adTERM STRATEGIES (5\u00ad15 Years) 1. Establish an agricultural park in every Natural Neighborhood district (Map D, p. 101 ) of the city with community gardens, year\u00adround production under greenhouses, limited processing, and food storage facilities. 2. Create a year \u00adround food market for local produce and supplementary foods in every Natural Neighborhood district (Map D, p. 101) 3. Provide 100 percent organic and local or regional food to students in the Monroe County Community School Corporation schools. 4. Provide 50 percent local or regionally \u00ad sourced food to institutional kitchens at IU, Ivy Tech, and Bloomington Hospital. 5. Implement a community service requirement for all IU undergraduates with a significant fraction of this community service dedicated to local sustenance issues. 6. Establish region\u00adwide farm training programs at local institutions and train and deploy 10,000 new farmers in the region. 7. Design and build five million square feet of greenhouse space for year round growing of integrated aquaponics. 8. Establish or expand local creamery and livestock butchering facilities. 9. Create a local, publicly\u00ad controlled seedbank and arboretum of food and useful plant species for propagation and sale within the region. 10. Inventory, document, and disseminate information to the public about the local flora and fauna of the Bloomington region, including native and adapted species, economic crops, other useful plants, and so\u00adcalled \"weed\" species, as well as their ecological relationships. Source: Daniel Or rReport of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 19811. Establish a credible local financing facility for the acquisition and development of farmland into small (0.5 to 20 acres), intensive integrated polyculture farmsteads. 12. Encourage the IU Kelley School of Business to offer at least a graduate degree in local business design and the School of Public and Environmental Affairs to offer a degree in applied environmental design. 13. Work with Monroe County to identify agriculturally \u00adsuitable, publicly \u00adowned parcels within and near the city to be zoned and brought into use as small farm allotments. LONG\u00adTERM STRATEGIES (15\u00ad30 Years) 1. Bank at least 100,000 acres within the seven \u00adcounty region for small \u00adfarm leaseholds (in usufruct). 2. Train and deploy 50,000 additional farmers in the area. 3. Create 50,000 new jobs in food, fiber, and organic goods processing and related services within the region. 4. Realize the goal of being able to feed all 120,000+ people in Monroe County primarily from the resources of the region (at 2 acres per person). 5. Extend the local food production system to other central and southern Indiana communities within our region and support the expansion of similar systems within the state and the Midwest. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 199 WATER: A HOUSEHOLDER'S PERPECTIVE Water is an essential element of life's sustenance\u2014one we take almost entirely for granted. At present, just about all our wa ter is provided by a highlyce ntralized, fossil fueldriven system. By any standard our pub lic water supply is a miracle of civic order and technical prowess. However, water's centra lity to life, health and the e conomy makes it especially vulnerable to a decline in cheap oil. The chapter on Municipal Services has covered much of the techn ical material related to the City of Bloomington's Utility Department operations and vulnera bilities. Here, we look at the water situation from the per spective of households and loca l food production to see how the present centralized wate r system can be supplemented an d the community made more watersecure. MITIGATION GOALS & STRATEGIES There is much that households can do to help foster water security. Water security is shaped by combined supply and d emandside management. As urban agriculture increases, demand for water will also rise; however, much of this need could be met by a concerted program of rainwater and roofwater collection. At present, Bloomington househo lds consume about 85 gallons of water per person per day. Without compromising essential services, this rate of con sumption could be reduced by more than 90% by making relat ively simple changes. These ch anges include structural ones, such as new plumbing devices and appliances, and behavior al ones. Such demand side changes are by far the cheapest way to foster water securi ty. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 200 Households can contribute signif icantly to improved water management and water security. The average nonconserving North American s ingle family household consumes about 70 gallons/capita/day (gpcd) for indoor uses, and an additional 30 gpcd for outdoor uses. Of the 70 gallons used indoors, 27% go to flush toilets, 18.5% are used in showers and baths, 1 6% flow through faucets and 22% supply washing machines, while 14% are lost to leaks.240 1. Flush smart. A program of conservation by imp roved plumbing fixtures has bee n estimated to reduce indoor water use by 40% to approx imately 42 gpcd. The main source of water savings is a reduction in water used to flush toilets (over 10 gpcd), based on the installation of 1.6 gallon/flush units (even more efficient toilets are available t oday). However, significant savings are also available throu gh the use of lowflow shower a nd faucet fixtures and from waterefficient laundry and dishwashing machines. 2. Behavioral changes. Some simple and easytoimplemen t behavioral changes at the household level can substantially reduce water use: Not rinsing dishes before loadin g them in a dishwasher can save up to 10 gallons per load, while for hand washing of dishes the use of dishpans can save half the water needed over washin g under a running tap; Toothbrushing or shaving in fron t of a running tap can waste up to 200 gallons per month of water; Keeping a pitcher of water in the refrigerator provides cold wa ter on demand without running the tap until the stream is cool; The initial gallons of cold water discharged when running a bath or starting a shower can be collected in a bucket for flushing the toilet; Using a stopvalve on the showerhead when soaping and scrubbing conserves dozens of gallons of hot water with measurable cost savings; 240 Christopher Kloss, Managing Wet Weather with Green Infras tructure: Municipal Handbook - Rainwater Harvesting Policies , EPA-833-F-08-010 (December 2008). Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 201 Running laundry machines and dishwashers at full capacity inste ad of doing small loads saves water on every load; and Used bathwater can be \"reused\" for hand laundry, and dishwater (held in dishpans) is more than suitable for flushing toilets. All told, it is possible to bring household water use down to u nder 10 gallons per capita per day without reducing sanitation or compromising any essential s ervices. 3. New fixtures New fixtures improve water use e fficiency, providing the same s ervices at lower water cost. Repairs to lea ks and changes in behavior\u2014lear ning the household water cascade and its economies\u2014conserves water that would otherwise be wasted. In a city with many rental units there are unfortunately conflicting incentives around reducing water use. Most multiunit buildings provide water as a service of rent, so tenants have no economic incentive to conserve. Conversely, in rented single family housing, old fixtures may waste water paid for by the te nant, while replacement of these is a cost the landlord may seek to avoid. The same problems apply, with even more acute energy impacts, to heating and cooling equipment, insulation, etc. The incentives align, however, for owneroccup ied houses. It is recognized tha t water use increases with affluence, with (ironically) aridity of climate, and in older h ousing stock (because of leaks, older plumbing fixtures and appliances). Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 202 4. Collect rainwater In addition to measures of conser vation and efficiency at the household level, it is possible to increase water supply available for outdoor and non potable indoor water use by collecting rainwater from roofs and other runoff. The use of rain barrels is becoming wides pread, while in some areas where water supply is already critical (such as Austin, Texas), the construction and use of household cisterns is commonplace today as it was a century ago in southern Indiana. An expected increase in urban gardening and farming with a consequent need for more irrigation water in summer give s focus and purpose to a communitywide program of rainwater catchment. Source: U.S. EPA. A rain barrel used to collect rooftop runoff using a gutter/downs pout system.Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 203WASTE: THE PERSPECTIVE OF LOCAL FOOD PRODUCTION The City collects mixed househol d waste and yard waste from res idents. County residents take bagged, mixed household was te to transfer stations. As dis cussed in the Municipal Services chapter, there is no local la ndfill. All community mixed waste is trucked 55 miles away to Vigo County. Yard waste and leaves collected by the City are disposed in one of two ways: 1) the waste is taken to a private company which the City pays to dump the trimmings (the company turns the trimming into mulch and sells the mulch on the open market); 2) the leaves are depos ited at a decommissioned wastew ater plant contaminated by PCBs. Liquid waste is delivered via underground pipes to ce ntralized plants which use aerobic methods of treatment and chemicals for finishing. No me thane is captured in this energyintensive process. VULNERABILITIES The practice of shipping our tra sh a considerable distance is c ertainly vulnerable to a decline in cheap oil. So too is the City's centralized waste t reatment plant. Sewage treatment - like water treatment - is highly reliant on a serie s of electric pumps and is subject to disruptions of the electrical grid. However, while these waste streams are a source of vulnerability, they also represent potential resources for local f ood production. We throw away a lot of organic material that we should be using to fertilize our gardens. Yard trimmings and food residuals constitute approximately 24 percent of our waste stream.241 The building of a local food system requires that we redirect local organic nutrients from the land fill to the garden through composting, chipandmulch, and other appropriate processes. I n addition to tree and shrub trimmings, grass clippings and collected yard waste, a gr eat deal of the community's solid waste consists of organic and compostable materials such as food waste, boxboard, 241 US Environmental Protection Agency.

Sources include house holds, restaurants, and institu tional food servers. Hair trimmings from salons and barber shops, stable waste, and cardbo ard cartons are also available. Because it already collects a large fraction of the community's organic waste materials, the City is in the be st position to organize the lar gescale chipping and composting of this material to supply soil nutrients to urban f armers and gardeners. MITIGATION GOALS & STRATEGIES In the longterm, the only way to mitigate the costs and vulnerabilities presented to our current waste system is to capture and divert the organic fraction of Bloomington's present waste stream to supply fertilizer for the local food system. SHORT TERM (1\u00ad5 Years) 1. Establish a centralized composting system for large \u00advolume processing. This can be the initiative of the Cit y, the Solid Waste Management D istrict, Indiana University, or a p rivate entity. 2. Create a \"compost corner\" in each of the 55 Natural Neighborhoods where smaller\u00adscale composting could go on to supply the community gardens and home. (See Map D, p. 101). 3. Encourage home composting to divert residential organic waste. 4. Encourage organic source separation by city residents; re\u00adequip the Sanitation Department's fleet and/or restructure collections to handle this stream. 5. Work with commercial kitchens, groceries, and institutional food servers to harvest food wastes to supply the compost operation, balancing this nitrogen \u00ad rich source with \"brown\" material in the form of dead plant matter and shredded paper and cardboard. Yard waste and food scraps are rich sources of soil nutrients when compos ted. Source: Wikimedia Commons Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 205MEDIUM TERM (5\u00ad15 Years) 1. Consider mandating source separation of organics from commercial and institutional sources. 2. Add in non\u00ad food organic waste sources as the capacity for materials handling is built. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 206HEALTH CARE The implications of peak oil for health care is a topic of incr easing discussion, not only among selforganized community groups, but also among and betwe en mainstream health care organizations, such as the American Medical Association an d Johns Hopkins.242 Marion County, Indiana has one o f the first county health departments to initiate a task force devoted to examining the i mplications of peak oil for public health.243 Observers generally point out tha t peak oil will affect our current health care system in at least four ways. Writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association , Dr. Howard Frumkin of the Centers for Disea se Control and coauthors sugge st that oil scarcity will affect health care through effects on: 1) medi cal supplies and equipment, 2) transportation, 3) energy generation, and 4) food production .244 Many medications such as aspirin and antibiotics are made from petroleum derivates, a nd many medical supplies (such as bandages, prosthetics, syringes, tubing, etc) contain oilderived plastics. Similarly, the current health care system is highly reliant on oil for transport: ambulances, organ transport, workers travelling to work, patients travelling to a ppointments, and the movement of medical equipment. L astly, as current food production is so dependent on petroleum for its production, pr ocessing and transport, any red uction in affordable, healthy food has implications fo r community health. While we have worked to address ways to shift our food producti on away from petroleum reliance, early on the Task Forc e agreed that a protracted exam ination of the implications of peak oil for local health car e was largely beyond the purvie w of the group. However, the subject is addressed here in the interest of highlighting the i mplications of peak oil and health care on a local level. W e hope that local health provid ers and stakeholders will examine this more closely. 242 Peak oil has been identified as a topic for mitigation by the Johns Hopkins Public Health Preparedness Programs. In March 12, 2009, Johns Hopkins hosted a Peak Oil and Health Conference http://www.jhsph.edu/preparedness/ Images/PeakOilFinalAgenda.pdf 243 Mary McKee, A Local Health Department Plans for Peak Oil. Paper presented at: 134th Annual Meeting of the American Public Health Association; N ovember 6, 2006; Boston, Petroleum and Public Health\" Journal of the American Medical Association 298, no 14 (2007): 16881690. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 207 VULNERABILITIES Until now, health care in the United States has been primarily a private concern that has evolved in an era of cheap energ y. It has been predicated on t he assumption that specialized equi pment and teams of highlyskilled professionals are the critical elements in health care. While t his model of healthcare delivery is superb at dealing with trauma, it is less well suited to dealing with the environmentallyinduced or dietbased degenerative illnesses that have become so common. Medical care in the U.S. today i s among the most energydepende nt sectors of the economy. Costs are spiraling out of contr ol and have contributed signifi cantly to the nation's economic dilemmas. High cost care is not necessarily high quality care. The World Health Organization ranks the U.S. 37th among nations in quality of health care.245 Already excessively dependent on emergency interventions at high cost, the system is likely to lurch further toward poor care as energybased economic contraction l eads people to avoid timely and preventive care. A rise in the number of uninsured p eople poses potential financial burdens. Of course, ri sing energy costs and shortages of energyintensive supplies, plus fuel cost and supply proble ms related to patient and emplo yee access to services threaten to push the system out of control. Bloomington Hospital is a major e mployer of people from through out the region and serves 10 Indiana counties. The hospital is situated in Bloomington's downtown and is served by Bloomington Transit (BT). The hos pital has recently merged with a large Indianapolis based group of hospitals and has plans to relocate outside of t he City's corporate boundary - ostensibly to better serve the wider region by emphasizing ease of commuting by highway. BT is limited to operat ions within the City's corporat e limits. If the hospital were to relocate out of the city cent er it would make services less accessible to those unable to drive, a portion of the public certain to rise substantially over the next decade. 245 WHO World Health Report 2000 \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad Health Systems, Improving Performance, http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/index.html ; http://www.photius.com/rankings/healthranks.html The United States was ranked beh ind nations like San Marino, An dorra, Malta, Singapore, Om an, Iceland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Colombia, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Chil e, Dominica, Morocco, Cy prus, and Costa Rica. Source: Wikimedia Common sReport of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 208MITIGATION GOALS & STRATEGIES: RE\u00adIMAGINING CARE While the City has little direct influence over the health care of its citizens, it can support a new way of thinking about health that may make our increasingly scarce health dollars stretch further and may help a v ulnerable medical establishment transition to an era of lower energy resources. Our present medical model is so depende nt on oil in part because it focuses on intervention rathe r than prevention. Beyond just working to substitute materials for the medical supplies that are so petroleum depend ent, we need a new model of taking care of ourselves and each other. Peak oil presents us with an oppo rtunity to do things better. W e will need to reconceive our present notion of personal responsibility away from paying for one's own insurance and medical care to better measures of personal car e beginning with diet and famil y health. It is instructive to reimagine our system of care as a series of concentric zones, wherein the most frequented systems of c are are at the core, and the le ssfrequented but still necessary components of the system are more distant. The Core: Individual and Family Conceiving health care as existing in a set of concentric zones , the individual and the family are properly the center of the h ealthcare system. The most ef fective care consists of personal and household practices that are healthy, including: p roper nutrition, exercise, reduction of stress, contact wit h nature, and avoidance of envi ronmental toxins. Both government and the medical estab lishment would better serve public health by educating and regulating with these aims in mind. Health is really only p ossible when this layer is vigorous, wellinformed and supported by public policy and cult ural expectations. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 209Palliative, Nursing or Maintenance Care Professional Care Professional Care - Decentralized Community Support & Complementary Modalities Individual & Family The Second Layer: Community Support and Complementary Modalities The next layer of care in a restructured system would consist o f mutual support from community members and what are sometimes called complementary or alternative modalities. These modalities of fer noninvasive, accessible, a nd lowercost care for a wide variety of conditions. Many milli ons of Americans already use t hese methods and systems, but they exist mostly outside the formal structure of insurance, hospitals, and recognized medicine. Perhaps more significantly, we exist in a matrix of social and environmental relations. The stronger and more connected the community is, the more easily individuals can maintain their own health. The Third Layer: Decentralized Delivery Systems A third layer of health care provision one that is largely absent from the U.S. system but which is present in countries such as Franc e and Cuba is local provision of formal medical services. The nationalized French h ealth service provides home visits by physicians to patients as needed, while in Cuba, doct ors' offices are located in every neighborhood. As transportation becomes more costly, it will be necessary to decentralize care and move servi ces down the scale of energy in tensity. Besides physicians' offices, these facilities might include smaller hea lth clinics for outpatient services. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 210The Fourth Layer: Professional Care in Centralized Locations The fourth layer of care in a restructured system would consist of what is often the first line of medical attention today: the provision of services by profes sionals in a centralized hospital or clinic. Hospitals wi ll need to revise their equipme nt and organization to respond to shortages of disposab le supplies and pharmaceuticals (which derive from oil), the inability of employees to commute as frequently, or as far, and even to the possibility of regular power interruptions. The Fifth Layer: Palliative, Nursing & Maintenance Care A fifth layer of care, which exi sts today primarily in the hosp ice setting, would be an expansion of palliative, nursing, or maintenance care for those individuals at the end of life or whose conditions are either not responsive to medical interv ention, or for whom the choice of medical manipulation i s unwelcome. It's quite within the realm of imagination that proper medical care, even for patients whose conditions ca n heal, might lie in providing supportive care and guidance outside either home or h ospital, as in a spa or sanitorium, where time and retra ining in new personal health practices could result in the reversal or remission of illness.246 Some elements of this layered care system exist today, though a rguably the first and most important of these is the weakest, and is under constant assault by commercial interests. A layered approach to health is most effective when all the elements in it are integrated and mutually reinforcing. Regrettably, the current medical model is poorly equipped to suture the layers of health together as conceived above. As citizens, as consumers of medical services, and as individuals and families concerned with our ow n wellbeing, we will have to demand more holistic thinking from everyone about the sources and pathways to health. With costs lowered by structural reorganization and new thinkin g, it might be possible to implement community scale health coverage for all, regardless o f what does or does not come about from federal action. 246 Thanks to Dr. Jifunza Wright, M .D. of Chicago, Illinois for s uggestions contributing to the new model of care. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 211The aim of a healthy postpeak Bloomington should be to: Create a resilient health care system which provides care that is more affordable and which minimizes the need for energyintensive intervention s and support s y s t e m s ; Increase the flexibility and range of responses available to local health care providers; and Support a concentration of essent ial medical services to remain in the central city location accessible by publi c transit and pedestrians. MITIGATION GOALS & STRATEGIES This discussion is offered as guidance and direction for policy and public discussion. Few of these recommendations involve action steps for City government. 1. Expand and support alternative health care options as set out above. 2. Create a mobile medical corps: for both house calls and disaster responses. 3. Encourage more nurse practitioners: they can perform many of the same procedures as a doctor, but their training is less expensive and time\u00ad consuming. Offices could be sited in more neighborhoods. 4. Consider how to create community\u00ad level health insurance to include a wide range of therapeutic modalities. 5. Bloomington will still need a hospital. a) Maintain the present downtown location of Bloomington Hospital; b) Build dormitory facilities for short \u00adterm use by hospital employees to mitigate against transportation problems; c) Expand the re\u00aduse of medical equipment, where appropriate and protective of health: reinstate the use of autoclave equipment; 247 and d) Prepare to manage intermittent power outages. Increase on\u00adsite fuel storage and Provide employee training in low\u00adenergy diagnoses needing only low\u00adtech tools and materials. 247 Equipment used to sterilize equ ipment at high temperatures. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 212Opportunities for Citizen Action: What can YOU do? \"Find your place on the planet. Dig in, and take responsibility from there.\" - Gary Snyder Peak oil is both a personal and collective call to action. It is an opportunity to find out what we can do when we apply our coll ective adaptability and creativ ity. While most of this Report focuses on what institutional a ctors can do to mitigate the ef fects of peak oil, there are many things we can all do to reduce our reliance on petrole um. These changes will be good for our community, the loca l economy, the environment and our own pocketbooks. Learn Learn more about peak oil. The Further Reading references at the end of this Report might be a good place to start. Share what you learn with others. Drive Less Carpool, walk, ride your bike, or take the bus. Telecommute if possible. Ask your employer to consider a fourday work week. Move closer to work or work closer to home, if possible. If you own any vehicle that gets less than 20 miles per gallon, it is time to trade it for a far more economical means of transportation. If you must use your personal au tomobile or truck, don't travel during peak traffic periods, consolidate your trips to reduce fuel consumption, drive slower, and make sure your tires are properly inflated. Campaign for dramatic increases in funding for public transportation. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 213\"Power Down\" at Home Electricity Simple changes at home can make a big difference. Residents can reduce energy costs by 1050% by implementing r elatively simple measures such as the following:248 Adjust your thermostat . For every degree that you lower your heat in the 6070\u00ba range, you can save up to 5 percent on heating costs in the winter. Similar savings can be a chieved by raising your thermos tat by a few degrees in the summer. Lower your hot water temperature. Set your water heater to the \"normal\" or 120\u00ba setting. Replace or clean furnace filters once a month. Dirty filters restrict airflow and increase energy use. Keeping your furnace clean, lu bricated, and properly adjusted can reduce heating costs by as much as 5 percent. Insulate your water pipes. Insulating the first five feet of pipe coming out of the top of your water hea ter can save considerable energ y. Pipe insulation is available fr om your hardware store. Seal air leaks. Caulk leaks around windows and doors. Look for places where you have pipes, vents or electrical conduits that go thro ugh the wall, ceiling, or floor. Check th e bathroom, underneath the kitchen sink, pipes inside a closet, etc. If y ou find a gap at the point wher e the pipe or vents goes through the wall, seal it up. Caulk works best on small gaps. Your hardware store should have products to close the larger ga ps. Consider replacing your old gas appliances. If your gas water heater is over 12 years old, consider r eplacing it with a newer, more efficient ENERGY STAR model. The best indi cato r of a water heater's effic iency is the Energy Factor (EF). The high er the EF, the more efficient the water heater. If your furnace is over 15 years old, consider replacing it with an ENERGY STAR rated model that is at least 15 percent more effici ent than standard models. Wash clothes in cold water. Air dry dishes instead of using your dishwasher's drying cycle. Air dry your clothes. Put up a clothesline. Turn off your computer, monitor and other appliances when not in use. 248 Parts of this list are borrowed from: Bloomington Environment al Quality Indicators Report (BEQI Report) Energy\u00adSaving Tips. http://bloomington.in.gov/documents/viewDocument.php?document_i d=2987 Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 214 Use power strips for your home electronics, such as TVs and DVD players, being sure to turn them off when the equipment is not in use (TVs and DVDs in standby mode still use several watts of power) . Buy ENERGY STAR home appliances and products. ENERGY STAR products meet strict efficiency guidelines set by the U.S. Envi ronmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy. Use compact fluorescent light bulbs. Changing your light bulbs to compact fluorescents will reduce your electric bill. A single 100watt bulb replaced with a 25watt scre win compact fluorescent can s ave you as much as $75 on your power bill over the life of that bulb. Water It is possible to bring household water use down to under 10 ga llons per capita per day without reducing sanitation or compromising any essential servi ces. Flush Smart. Most flush toilets use over 10gpcd. Low flow toilets are 1.6 gallon/flush units which are estimated to reduce indoor water u se by 40% to approximately 42 gpcd. Take short showers. Don't rise dishes before loading them. Not rinsing dishes befo re loading them in a dishwasher can save up to 10 gallons per load, while for hand w ashing of dishes the use of dishpans can save half th e water needed over washing und er a running tap. Turn tap off while you brush and shave. Toothbrushing or shaving in front of a running tap can waste up to 200 gallons per month of water. Keep a pitcher of cold water in the refrigerator. This provides cold water on demand without running the t ap until the stream is cool. Recycle your bath water. The initial gallons of cold water discharged when running a bath or starting a show er can be collected in a bucke t for flushing the toilet. Used bathwater can be \"reused\" for hand laundry. Dishw ater (held in dishpans) is more than suitable for flushing toilets. Install a stop\u00advalve on the showerhead . Using such a valve when soaping and scrubbing conserves dozens of ga llons of hot water with measurable cost savings. Wash only full loads of dishes and clothes. Running laundry machines and dishwashers at full capacity instead of doing small loads saves water on every load. Install new fixtures. New fixtures improve water use efficiency and providing the same services at a lower water cost. Collect rainwater. It is possible to increase water supply available for outdoor a nd nonpotable indoor water use by collecting rainwater from roofs and other runoff.

It will profoundly affect our commu nity most in the areas of sustenance, transportation, land use, housing, and municipal se rvices. We must all begin now to build other, more resilie nt supports for our common life . These supports will consist of understandings, agreements, assumptions, physical st ructures, and cultural practices that will recognize lower energy availability not as a problem, but as an opportunity and a condition to which we must adapt ourselves in dividually and collectively. Many of us need to become partti me farmers and water harvester s, to learn some effective health practices, and to notice and become responsible for coll ecting and conserving organic matter everywhere. Many of us must learn how to insulat e our homes better. Many of us will have to learn how to better navigate public transit. Many of us will ride our bikes to work and carpool with neighbors to the grocery. Many of us w ill be required to continue on the path of vigilant resource conservation. The City of Bloo mington will have to intensify its alreadyactive efforts to foster sustainable community well being by rethinking the way it provides services to residents. Some of these forms of adaptation will be familiar or recogniza ble from past eras. Others have never been applied. In all ca ses, the answers require us t o take greater responsibility for selfprovision, for thoughtful cooperation with those around us, and for greater attention to the resources and possibilities of our homes, our neighborhoods, and our community.

The Task Force d oes not necessarily endorse every opinion in every work listed. BOOKS BROWN, Lester. Plan B 2.0: Rescuing a Planet Under Stress and a Civilization in Trouble. W.W. Norton, 2006. Plan B has three components: (1) a restructuring of the global economy so that it can co ntain civilizati on; (2) an all out effort to eradicate poverty, stabilize population, and restore hope in order to elicit parti cipation in the developing countries; and (3) a systematic effort to restore natural syste ms. http://www.earth policy.org/Books/PB2/index.htm . CAMPBELL, C.J. The Coming Oil Crisis. MultiScience Publishing, 2004. An interdisciplinary treatment of how much oil remains to be found and for how long global oil resources can continue to support the expected growth in demand . Campbell concludes that given current production rates, peak production will be re ached some time in the first decade of the new millennium. Bas ed on this conclusion, Campbell examines three scenarios and offers some interesting insights into the possibl e consequences to a world that has to adjust to a dwindling oil supply. CATTON, William Robert. Overshoot: the Ecological Basis of Revolutionary Change . University of Illinois Press, 19 80. Suggests that humanity has already exceeded the long term carrying capacity of the earth and is now relying on the \" phantom carrying capacity\" of nonrenewable resources that will some day disappear.

Blackout: Coal, Climate and the Last Energy Crisis. New Society Publishers, 2009. Heinberg notes that \"Only recently have a f ew analysts attempted peaking forecasts for world coal, and those forecasts show a li kely peak for world coal production before midcentury, p ossibly as soon as 2025.\" He al so highlights the dependency of coal as an energy source on petroleumbased trans portation, suggesting that \"Peak Oil May hasten Peak Coal.\" HEINBERG, Richard, and C.J. Campbell. The Oil Depletion Protocol. New Society Publishers, 2006. Describes a possible international agreement , the \"oil depletion protocol\" (originally proposed by Campbell), whereby nations wo uld voluntarily reduce their oil production and oil imports. The purpose of the proto col is to reduce international rivalry over oil supplies and pre vent possible resource wars. The book provides a review of the history and literature of peak oil and explains the prot ocol and its implications for government and industry. It also explains how municipalities a nd citizens can become involved. HEINBERG, Richard. The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies . New Society Publishers, 2005.

Therefore, almost 7mbd of additional capacity must come on line every year just to offset these giant fields. Besides the decline in these, the largest fields, what else mig ht affect the observable rate of oil production and its availability to the world? 1. Technology A. Technology may bring more oil onstream, both from old fields where advanced recovery may yield oil previously thought inacce ssible, and from new fields that are often at the margins of what current technology can bring to the market. To be economically viable, both of these options requi re capital investment. More importantly, they are limited by the energy required to ex tract the resource. Since it does not make energetic sense to invest more energy th an one receives in return, some oil will ultima tely remain inaccessible. 2. Technology B. Very advanced oil extraction tec hnology has already been emplo yed to raise production and extend t he life of major fields, such a s Canterell (Mexico), and the North Sea (England, Denmark and Norway). However, alth ough advanced technology may extend the produc tion plateau, or raise the rate of production initially, it often results in a steeper rate of decline (1520 % for the cases mentioned above). Thus, it represents an unintended consequence that may increase the overall rate of decline in a very rapid manner. 3. Investment in oil exploration and recovery in a time of high volatility of price . Exotic oil recovery, in the form of tar sands, heavy - high su lfur oils, and the deep sea requires high prices. The current collapse in the price of oil has limited investment, and thus less reso urce development has occurred. Since even conventional oil requires years from discovery to delivery, p rice booms and busts may only add to the discontinuity of supply. 4. Export Land Model . Developed most fully by petroleum exploration geologist Jeffrey Brown, in its most simple form this model describes dec line in oil exports as a consequence of greater demand by the exporting country. This has been cogently 253 International Energy Agency, World Energy Outlook 2008; See also, Neil King & Fr itsch, \"Energy Watchdog Warns Of OilProduction Crunch I EA Official Says Supplies May Plateau Below Expected Demand,\" Wall Street Journal, May 22, 2008. http://online.wsj.com/article/ SB121139527250011387.html?mod=hpp _us_whats_news Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 227argued by Brown to dramatically d ecrease oil supply to importin g consumers and to do so at a rate above the observ ed geologic rate of decline. 5. Geopolitical conflict . Some 17 million barrels per day are shipped out of a very narrow waterway, the Gulf of Horm uz, in the Middle East. Obstruction of this key point of access, in the event of conflict in the region, would have immediate and severe effects on oil importing countries. This is just one of many possible global flashpoints that may aff ect future oil supply. 6. The U.S. dollar. Denominating oil in dollars bri ngs a clear advantage to the U. S., as does the status of the dollar as the world reserve currency. I t is far from certain that this arrangement will continue, as a number of countries have s poken openly of diversifying their exchange port folio to include the euro, the yuan and the yen. If these proposed arrangements come to pass, the value of the doll ar may plunge, and imported oil may become unaffordable for many U.S. citizens. 7. Heavy oil, oil shales, tar sands, and biofuels. These resources offer some limited supply but are constrained either energetically or by other res ource inputs (e.g. water, land to grow crops). They will offer only a modest supp ly of liquid fuels in the future. 8. The discovery of new, large fields . Although fewer and far be tween, the possibility remains that large fields of ten s of billions of barrels may ye t be discovered. Some finds of late, such as Tupi off the coast of Brazil in developm ent by Petrobras, or deep water Gulf of Mexico (e.g., the Tiber Field developed by B ritish Petroleum). While these fields may yield billions of barrels of oil, one ne eds to place it within the context of current world use (a billion barrels are consumed ev ery 11 days). It is also observed that these latest finds are incredibly expensive, and stretch current technology to the limit (Tiber, for instance, requires drilling in deepwater, and at a total depth of 35,000 ft.). Las tly, because field development may take many years, oil discovered today may not be available for some time. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 228APPENDIX II COAL: NOT AS PLENTIFUL AS WIDELY BELIEVED Projected Peak: 2030 Of all the nonrenewable fuels, c oal is widely believed to be t he most plentiful and the one whose production will probably peak the last. It is true that the United States is particularly wellplaced with regard to coal reserves, with 120 billion tons of oil equivalent (Btoe) as of 2005. This is almos t twice the amount of reserves claimed by its closest rival, Russia, with 69 Btoe.254 However, there is good reason to doubt the conve ntional wisdom about coal being availabl e in superabundance. Unfortunately, estimates of the amount of recoverable coal worl dwide are subject to a good deal of uncertainty because of t he poor quality of reserves dat a. According to a 2007 report by Germany's Energy Watch Group, \"the data quality in general is very poor and the reported data cannot be regarded as a realistic assessment of ' proved recoverable coal reserves,'\" and \"there is probab ly much less coal left to be bu rnt than most people think.\"255 Lending weight to this conclusion were huge revisions in reserv e assessments by the World Energy Council for particular countries over the past two decad es. Examples, for bituminous and anthracite, include the following: In 1991, the reserve estimate fo r China was reduced from 152,83 1 million tons (Mt) to 62,200 Mt and then not subsequently revised despite rapidly rising production/consumption. In 2003, the reserve estimate fo r Germany was reduced from 23,0 00 Mt to 183 Mt, a reduction of 99%. This is becau se, as the Energy Watch Group w ryly noted, \"large reserves formerly seen as proven have been reassessed as being speculative .\" 1998, the reserve estimate for Poland was reduced from 29,100 M t to 12,113 Mt. In 2001, it was raised to 20,300 Mt. Then, in 2004, it was reduce d again, this time to 14,000 Mt. 254 Energy Watch Group, Coal: Resources and Future Production (http://www.energywatchgroup.org/fileadmin/g lobal/pdf/EWG_Report _Coal_10072007ms.pdf ), Mar. 2007, 6. 255 Ibid., 24 and 4. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 229In general, the trend has been for coal reserve estimates to be downgraded significantly rather than upgraded significantly, although the re have been exceptions. One of the most notable exceptions was an upgrade in the reserve estimate for India in 1990 from 12,610 Mt to 60,098 Mt, and then in fo ur additional steps through 2004 to 90,085 Mt.256 By 2007, however, the World Energy Council was reporting a reserve estim ate for Indian bituminous of only 52,240 Mt257 after India stopped reporting \"i n situ\" coal and started repor ting \"recoverable\" coal.258 The World Energy Council's estim ate of total recoverable coal in the world as of the end of 2005 was 847,388 Mt (430,896 Mt of anthr acite and of subbituminous, and 149,744 Mt of lignite).259 Prof. David Rutledge of Caltech believes that the actual amount is considerably lower: 662,000 Mt.260 Statements to the effect that \"We have hundreds of years of coa l remaining\" are suspect and apt to be rather misleading. We should be very careful ab out taking such statements at face value. The amount of coa l (or oil, or natural gas) rem aining is often expressed in terms of a reservetoproduction (R/P) ratio - that is, the estimate amount of remaining reserves, divided by the current year's production. Such estimates can be made for the entire world, for a single nation, or for part of a nation. 256 Ibid., 26. 257 World Energy Council, 2007 Survey of Energy Resources (http://www.worldenergy.org/docu ments/ser2007_final_online_versi on_1.pdf), 10. 258 Ibid., 2. 259 Ibid., 11. 260 David Rutledge, Hubbert's Peak, the Coal Question, and Climate Change, Watson Lecture at California Institute of Technology, 10/17/2007, http://today.caltech.edu/theater/item?story%5fid=24502 Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 230For example, according to the Indiana Geological Survey, Indian a has about 17.54 billion tons of \"available coal resources\" remaining: The term \"available coal resources\" is defined as: Original coal resources, minus coal mined and lost in mining, minus coal restricted by land use, minus coal restricted by technological factors.261 The Indiana Geological Survey states, \"Taking into account the current level of coal production in Indiana (approxim ately 30 million [mln] short ton s a year), 17.54 billion tons of coal could last about 585 years.\" 262 261 Maria Mastalerz et al., Characterization of Indiana's Coal Resource: Availability of the Reserves, Physical and Chemical Properties of the Coal, and Present and Potential Uses, OpenFile Study 0402, Indiana Geological Survey, July 2004, 16. 262 Ibid., 2324. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 231Unfortunately, stated coal R/P ratios are subject to wild fluct uations, depending on revisions in estimates on the am ount of recoverable coal remain ing, and changes in the amount of coal currently being produced. In general, R/P ratio s for coal have tended to be adjusted downward rather than up ward (in part because, as noted above, there has been a tendency to adjust reserve estim ates downward). For example, t he earliest R/P ratio estimate for the United States, made in the 1920's, claimed tha t the U.S. had enough coal to last for over 4000 years,263 but this calculation was badly flawed, partly because of an exaggerated estimate on the amou nt of recoverable coal in the country. More recent R/P ratio estimates claim that the U.S. has enough coal to last a l ittle over 200 years. The Indiana Geological Survey's statement that Indiana coal \"could last about 585 years\" is based on the Survey's conclu sion that Indiana has approximately 17.5 billion tons of available coal resources. There is a major discrepancy between that figure and the figure currently being reported by the federal Energy Information Administration (EIA): a \"demonstrated reserve base\" of 9.379 billion tons, and \"estimated recoverable reserves\" of 4.001 billion tons. 264 Clearly, if the EIA figure is correct, then Indiana's coal w ould not last 585 years at the current productio n rate, but considerably less - using a figure of 4.001 billion tons of recoverable reser ves, the R/P ratio would point to about 134 years. When queried about the discrepancy between the Indiana Geologic al Survey and Energy Information Agency figures regarding Indiana coal reserves, George Warholic of the EIA attributed it to \"EIA's current inability to incorporate update d reserve data into [its] existing database\" because of la ck of funding - an admission th at the data provided by the 263 Rutledge, Hubbert's Peak. 264 Energy Information Administrati on, \"Recoverable Coal Reserves at Producing Mines, Estimated Recoverable Reserves, and Demonst rated Reserve Base by Mining M ethod,\" Report no. DOE/EIA 0584 (2007), released September 2008 ( http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/coal/page/acr/table15.html ) We have all heard the coal industry's often repeated boast that America is the \"Saudi Arabia of coal.\" The idea that America has 250 years of coal supplies has been repeated so often that has become almost a part of our culture and unfortunately gives policymakers what I believe to be excessive comfort. - Robert A. Hefner, The GET, 2009. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 232federal agency charged with producing the \"official energy stat istics from the U.S. government\" are perhaps somewhat questionable. According to Warholic, there was another likely explanation as well: \"differences in recoverable reserves definitions.\" The statement that Indiana has 585 years of coal left at the current production rate comes from a 2004 report by the Ind iana Geological Survey entitled Characterization of Indiana's Coal Resource: Availability of the Reserves, Physical and Chemical Properties of the Coal, and Present and Potential Uses. Warholic indicated familiarity with this document, and said, \"The report does not seem to provide any recovery factors, i.e., the amount of coal recovered from minin g the available resources. For Indiana coal production, EIA uses recovery ratios of 41.4 p ercent for underground and 58.5 percent for surface mines. These recovery factors would substantially deflate the reserve estimate of 17 billion tons.\"265 Indeed they would. Assuming that Indiana has 2.0 billion tons of coal \"available\" for surface mining and 15.5 bi llion tons \"available\" for underground mining, then the tot al amount of coal actually \"rec overable\" would be, according to the EIA's recovery r atios, 1.17 billion tons from surface mining and 6.417 billion tons from underground m ining, or 7.587 billion tons. T his is considerably more than the 4.001 billion tons acco rding to the EIA's \"official\" f igures, but considerably less than the 17.5 billion tons accord ing to the Indiana Geological Survey and would point to a R/P ratio that would imply that Indiana has about \"254 years\" o f coal left, not 585 years. Unfortunately, the Task Force does not have the expertise to ju dge which numbers those of the Indiana Geological Survey or those of the Energy Informa tion Administration represent a more accurate pictu re of Indiana coal reserves. In addition to considering the \"reserves\" numerator in the R/P ratio somewhat uncertain, we must also note that the \"production\" divisor is subject to change from year to year. Thus, if the production rate goe s down, the recoverable coal wi ll last longer, while if the production rate goes up, the rec overable coal will not last as long. Coal production in Indiana has been subject to considerable variation over the pas t century, rising to one peak 265 Personal communication from George Warholic, Energy Information Administration, December 9, 2008. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 233during World War I, then falling as production shifted to nonu nion mines in other states and because of the Great Depress ion, then rising to a second pe ak during World War II, then falling into another trough during the 1950's, and then ri sing once again to a new and even higher peak, or series of peaks: Source: Maria Mastalerz et al., Characterization of Indiana's Coal Resource, 2004, p. 76 After 1990, Indiana coal production took a dip because highsul fur Illinois Basin coal could not be burned in many power plants due to new federal environme ntal regulations. Typically, such power plants began using coal from the Powder R iver Basin of Wyoming instead. This subbituminous coa l is inferior in heat content to bituminous Illinois Basin coal, but is lower in sulfur. N ow, many of the power plants burning Powder River coal have had scrubbers installed to deal with the sulfur problem, and have begun using Illinois Basin coal again. As a result, Indiana coal production is again near an alltime high. In March 2009, Peabody Energy announced a new mine in Sullivan County that will be the largest surface mine in the eastern United States and will produce 8 mi llion tons of coal per year. This single mine would increase coal production in Indiana by a bout 25% with a corresponding decrease in the amount of time that Indiana's rem aining coal can be expected to last.266 266 \"Indiana Plans Spur to Big Coal Mine,\" Trains, June 2009, 13. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 234The statement that \"Indiana has 585 of coal remaining at the current rate of production\" is apt to be particularly misleading unless consideration is given to the current rate of consumption. The fact is that, at least un til recently, Indiana has been consuming about twice as much coal as it produce s, with most of the \"imported\" coal coming from the states of Wyoming, West Virginia, and Illinois: If Indiana were required to be selfsufficient in coal, it woul d (barring a halving of consumption) have to double its coal production, which means th at current coal reserves would last only half as long as they would at the present produ ction rate. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 235Although the prevailing sense am ong governments and certainly a mong the general public is that there is \"plenty\" of coal left in the world, the Energy Watch Group warns that global production could peak as early as 20202025. The EWG is particularly conc erned about the supply situation in China, where consumption has been rising especially rapidly over the last decade. It believes that \"China will reach maximum production within the next 515 years, probably around 2015.... The steep rise in production of the past few years must be followed by a steep decline after 2020.\" 267 It also believes that \"the strongly rising producti on of China will have a substantial influence on the peak of world coal production. Once China cannot increase its production any more global coal production will peak.\" 268 Startling as the conclusion that global coal production will pe ak by 20202025, even more startling is the Energy Watch Gro up's conclusion that U.S. coal production may already have peaked: \"Though total produ ction volumes are still increas ing due to the expanding production of subbituminous coal in Wyoming, coal production in terms of energy had already peaked in 1998 at 598 Mtoe [million tons of oil equival ent] compared to 576 Mtoe in 2005.\"269 On the other hand, the EWG note s that the U.S. still retains, if the official figures are to be believed, substantial remaining coal reserves in several other states. Its argument that \"it is not probabl e that the huge reserves in Mon tana, Illinois, Western 267 Energy Watch Group, Coal, 27. 268 Ibid., 15. 269 Loc cit. The peak of world oil production in 2010 will impact the world economy profoundly. Without a coherent effort to proactively reduce energy consumption further while developing renewable sources, the decline of coal toward the middle of the century will deliver a coup de grace to industrial civilization, making the maintenance of the electrical grid impossible. We will then have come to the end of the road, having used nature's endowment of cheap, energy dense fuels without having built a bridge to the future. What follows is the final Blackout.\" Source: Heinberg, Blackout, p. 167. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 236Kentucky and Ohio will be converted into production\"270 is not entirely c onvincing. Should global coal production peak earl y and leave the world hungry fo r hydrocarbons, it seems unlikely that these reserv es would remain untapped. Indiana currently exports only a small amount of coal to power plants in neighboring states, it is possible to imagine a scenario in which Indiana participates in an export boom and significantly increases its production. Should that happen , there would be an increase in the size of the production di visor in the state's R/P ratio, reducing the \"number of years\" that the state's coal would last. This would especially be the case if demand for coal generated electricity increases significantly because peak oil causes the world to turn to electric vehicles or coaltoliq uids (CTL) production. On the other hand, the increase in demand could be moderated by rap id penetration of wind or solargenerated electricity into the marketplace - or, possi bly even more likely, as a resu lt of the widespread substitution of natural ga s for coal (see below). A careful recent study of when w orld coal production will peak is an article by S.H. Mohr and G.M. Evans, \"Forecasting Coal Production Until 2100,\" accep ted for publication in the journal Fuel. According to Mohr and Evans, d epending on the actual amount of ultimately recoverable coal in the world, production could \"peak between 2 010 and 2048 on a mass basis and between 2011 and 2047 on an energy basis. The Best G uess scenario assumed a URR [ultimately recoverable resource] of 1144 Gt and peaks in 2 034 on a mass basis, and in 2026 on an energy basis.\"271 Given a \"best guess\" that world coal production will peak in 2026 \"on an energy basis,\" the Task Force feels that it would b e prudent to assume that the peak will occur by 2030. 270 Ibid., 38. 271 S.H.

Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 237The following projection of futur e coal production trends by th e Energy Watch Group is consistent with the estimate by Mohr and Evans: Source: Energy Watch Group, Coal: Resources and Future Production, March 2007 Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 238APPENDIX III NATURAL GAS: PLENTIFUL - AT LEAST FOR NOW WHEN WILL IT PEAK? As recently as 2005, natural gas production levels in North America were stagnant or declining, and it was beginning to appear that they had peaked. This was significant because, while natural gas elsewhere in the world, particularly in the Middle East and Russia, is still plentiful, transporting it to the United States presents a problem: in its ordinary gaseous state, it cannot be carried across the ocean i n bulk tankers. Transoceanic shipment of natural gas requires that the gas be supercooled and liquefied, then shipped in special tankers. These tankers r equire special terminals for loading and unloading. With a potential natural gas shortage i n North America looming on the horizon, substantial investments were made to constru ct liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipping and terminal facilities. In the past few years, the North American natural gas situation has changed rather dramatically. Instead of going down, production was, until the current recession drastically curtailed demand, actually going up. This development is main ly due to new drilling technologies - horizontal drilli ng, and hydraulic fracturing (\" fracing\"). Fracing is a particularly noteworthy developm ent that has made it possible to recover substantial amounts of gas from shale format ions previously considered unsu itable for drilling. A nonprofit organization of volunteer experts called the \"Pote ntial Gas Committee\" (PGC) regularly reviews the U.S. natural situation and issues a bienn ial assessment of supplies. In June, 2009, the PGC announced its latest report and declared an \"unprecedented increase in magnitude of [the] U.S. natural gas resource base\" amounting to an increase of over 25% from the previous report. The r evised estimate of the \"resourc e base,\" 1,836 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) is resou rce evaluation in the Committee's 44year history,\" and the committee pegged the nation's \"total available future supply\" a t 2,074 Tcf. The committee Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 239asserted, \"Consequently, our pre sent assessment demonstrates an exceptionally strong and optimistic gas supply picture for the nation.\"272 This announcement was immediatel y followed by a press release f rom T. Boone Pickens, who declared, Today's report substantiates wha t I've been sayin g for years: there's plenty of natural gas in the U.S. I launc hed the Pickens Plan a year ago to help reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign oil, and using our abundant sup ply of natural gas as a transition fuel for fleet v ehicles and heavyduty trucks i s a key element of that plan. On the same day this report is going out, diesel prices are again on the rise, squeezing the trucking industry. Now more than ever we need to take action to enact energy reform that will immediately reduce oil imports. The 2,074 trillion cubic feet of domestic natural g as reserves cited in the study is the equivalent of nearly 350 billion barrels of oil, about the same as Saudi Arab ia's oil reserves. 273 The famous \"Pickens Plan,\" launc hed with so much fanfare in Jul y 2008, calls for the substitution of wind energy for natural gas in e lectricity production so that the natural gas can be diverted for use as a tra nsportation fuel. However, efforts to find financing for Pickens' wind project collapsed along with the credit markets. By January 2009, Pickens declared that \"the wind stuff is deader than hell right now.\" 274 Where Pickens advocates diverting natural gas from electricity production to transportation, climate change activist (and former Acting Assi stant Secretary of Energy for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy) Joseph Romm is pushing an almost opposite strategy. Romm wants to use our apparently plentiful gas suppl y as a \"climate action game changer\": \"Natural gas alone could essentially meet the entire Waxman Markey CO 2 target for 2020 - without requiring gobs of new power plants to be sit ed and built or thousands of miles of new transmission lines. There is simply no doubt that, other than energy efficiency 272 \"Potential Gas Committee Reports Unprecedented Increase in Mag nitude of U.S. Natural Gas Resource Base,\" http://www.mines.edu/Potential GasCommitteereportsunprecedentedincreaseinmagnitudeof U.S.naturalgasresourcebase . 273 \"T.

Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 240and conservation, the lowestcost option for achieving largesc ale CO 2 reductions by 2020 is simply replacing electricity by burning coal with power gene rated by burning more natural gas in the vast array of currently underutilized gas fired plants.... Natural gas is the cheapest, lowcarbon baseload power around.\"275 The Task Force is cau tiously optimistic that recent upward revisions in the estimated U.S. natural gas resource base are reasonable, and cautiously hopeful that they are not wildly mis leading. While natural gas is certainly not a zerocarbon fuel , compared to petroleum, and ce rtainly compared to coal, it produces far less carbon dioxide.276 It is less polluting in other ways as well. What is unclear is whether it is now so abundant that we could easily use it to phase out most of our coalfired power plants and at the same time run half our e xisting auto fleet on it - that is, to pursue Pickens' vision an d Romm's vision simultaneously. While natural gas now appears to be plentiful, no one should be deceived into believing that it will permanently \"solve\" our energy problem. Oil produ ction is peaking now, and at some point, natural gas producti on will surely do so as well. However, because of the uncertainty surrounding the exten t of the world's natural gas s upplies, it is difficult to assign a very precise date to \"peak natural gas.\" In 2006, Jea n Laherrere estimated that natural gas production would peak around 2030.277 Laherrere is a petroleum engineer who, with his colleague Colin Cam pbell, published the article \" The End of Cheap Oil\" in Scientific American in 1998. This article signaled the genesis of the subsequent increased attention to the peak oil phenomenon. We consider Laherrere's work to have a considerable degree of credibili ty, and thus are inclined to ac cept his date of 2030 for the peak in natural gas production. However, it may not take sufficient account of the potential of nonconventional gas. 275 Joseph Romm, \"Climate Action Ga me Changer, Part 1: Is There a Lot More Natural Gas than Previously Thought?\" June 3, 2009, http://climateprogress.org/2009/ 06/03/climateactiongamechang er unconventionalnaturalgasshale/ . 276 \"The best natural gas power pla nts produce less than half as m uch carbon dioxide per kWh of electricity as coal fired plants.\" Craig A. Severance, \"Game Changer 3: New N atural Gas Supplies - Great for LowCost Climate Future? (paper presented at Groningen A nnual Energy Convention, Nov. 21, 2006), pp. 2223. Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 241The following graph from the Asso ciation for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas Ireland shows historical oil and gas productio n, with a projection for future production through 2050. It appears to be compatible with the Laherrere estimate of peak na tural gas around 2030. It shows the world to be on an oil andgas plateau sloping very gr adually downward until about 2020, when the decline becomes much steeper. It is impor tant to note that the most of the decline is accounted for by falling oil production. The decline in natural gas production is much more modest. Source: ASPO Ireland Report of the Bloomington Peak Oil Task Force 242Putting it all together: \"peak energy\" by 2030? In summary, we think that the following dates for the peaking o f the various fossil fuels are plausible: Oil: 20082015 Coal: 2030 Natural is placed after the 2030 projected date of peak natural gas, to allow for the possibility that a peak may occur later if recent optimistic evaluations of the magnitude of the nonconventional gas resource prove correct. If all of the three fossil fuels peak in production by 2030 (or well before, in the case of petroleum), we think it would be quite difficult for world ener gy production to grow for very long after that point, even allowing major increases in re newable energy production - and possibly nuclear energy as well.
