Consider the fact that divine revelation is not an idea or thought that comes from the brain or from life experiences. Rather, it is a direct and intentional communication from the heart, mind, and Will of God. Therefore, it becomes a complete awareness of what was not previously known and understood. In His unlimited kindness, knowledge, and wisdom, Holy Spirit has given me the perfect title for this book, as well as the definition. \"Spiritual Protocol\" is the appropriate manner in which we, as seasoned men, and women of God should function and operate in carrying out our spiritual callings and procedures in accordance with the Word of God. Three powerful Scriptures provide the biblical foundation upon which each chapter of this inspired writing is built, regarding targeted subjects. To God be all the honor and the glory for all of the things which He has done through His Son and by His Spirit.", "sitename": "Words Unite Bookstore", "date": "2023-08-18", "cleaned_text": "Spiritual Protocol (By Gwen Philmon) | Words Unite Bookstore "}
