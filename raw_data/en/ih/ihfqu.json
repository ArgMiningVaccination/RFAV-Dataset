It is an antioxidant-rich herbal preparation described as a Rasayana (rejuvenator) medicine by Ayurvedic practitioners. Combining the three fruits is said to be responsible for triphala's numerous health benefits. 1 Triphala is made from dried fruits of three different plants: fruits of Terminalia chebula are high in tannins such as gallic acid, ellagic acid, chebulic Composition The fruits of Terminalia bellerica consist of proteins and oils that include omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (linoleic acid). Because of its high fatty acid content, this plant can impact cholesterol levels, increasing high-density lipoprotein levels (good cholesterol) while decreasing low-density lipoprotein levels (bad cholesterol), making it effective in treating coronary artery disease. Phyllanthus emblica (amla) fruits are high in ascorbic acid i.e. vitamin C. 2 The high density of tannins may contribute to the overall bitterness of amla. These fruits also include punicafolin and phyllanemblinin A, phyllemblin, and other polyphenols such as gallic acid, ellagic acid, flavonoids, kaempferol.2 Based on my experience, I have come across evidence suggesting that Amalaki, which is a component of Triphala, may possess properties to manage diseases of the sense organs and enhance memory. It is believed that the active compounds present in Amalaki exert beneficial effects on the central nervous system, potentially improving sensory function and memory. [Dr. Siddharth Gupta, MD](https://pharmeasy.in/legal/editorial-policy/dr-siddharth-gupta-73) Uses of Triphala It is described as a tridoshic Rasayana in Ayurveda, capable of balancing and rejuvenating the three doshas that regulate human life: Vata, pitta, and Kapha. It is widely used in several disease conditions owing to its following properties:1,3 - laxative - anti-inflammatory - antiviral - Blood purifying - analgesic - anti-arthritic - hypoglycemic - anti-ageing - antibacterial Triphala is used to treat fatigue, oxidative stress, and infectious disorders like tuberculosis, pneumonia, AIDS, and periodontal disease, among others. for headaches, dyspepsia, ascites, and leukorrhea.3 In my experience, I have observed that Triphala, a herbal formulation, may have the ability to increase the number of red blood cells and improve haemoglobin content in the body, making it potentially beneficial for managing anaemia. The active compounds in Triphala are believed to stimulate the production of red blood cells, leading to an increase in hemoglobin levels and overall improvement in anaemic conditions.
