You can also check your county and local pharmacies for vaccine availability. We recommend staying up to date on your vaccines.

Serious health events after the COVID-19 vaccine, such as myocarditis, are rare.

[See FAQ below about mixing and matching for details.](#faq) No, if your child completed the original (monovalent) series, they do not need to redo their vaccines. However, they may need to get their bivalent booster to be considered up to date. [See Booster FAQs for guidance.](#faq) Those eligible to receive the first bivalent COVID-19 booster include: - Most individuals, depending on age, who received the monovalent COVID-19 vaccine, but have not yet received a dose of a bivalent vaccine. - Everyone 5+ who has had their primary series; the bivalent booster should be given at least 2 months after any COVID vaccine or booster dose. - Children 6 months and 5 years who have received the Moderna vaccine can get the updated Moderna booster. - Children between the ages of 6 months and 4 years who have received all 3 doses of the monovalent Pfizer vaccine can get the updated Pfizer booster, at least 2 months after completing their primary series.

Additional doses may be administered at the discretion of their healthcare provider. However, for immunocompromised children 6 months through 4 years of age, eligibility for additional doses will depend on the vaccine previously received. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued [guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html) on February 11, 2022 for immunocompromised people. Those who fall in this category and who've had the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna) should get a fourth shot (booster dose) at least three months after completing the three-dose primary series. For those who've had the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine, an mRNA dose is recommended at least 28 days after the first shot, followed by a third dose at least two months later. [Learn more about the CDC guidance \u00bb](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html) Under new CDC guidelines, people who are immunocompromised who have received a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine may may now receive a single additional dose of a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine at least 2 months following a dose of a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine. Additional doses may be administered at the discretion of their healthcare provider. For immunocompromised children 6 months through 4 years of age, eligibility for additional doses will depend on the vaccine previously received. Stanford Health Care patients who are eligible for additional doses can schedule their appointments through [MyHealth](https://myhealth.stanfordhealthcare.org/Private#/appointments/apptmake) now. Individuals with recent COVID-19 infection may receive their booster dose after their symptoms resolve and they have met criteria to discontinue isolation [per CDC guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html). The CDC does not recommend mixing vaccines for certain age groups. See guidance below: - Children who only completed 2 doses of the original (monovalent) Pfizer vaccines should get the updated bivalent Pfizer vaccine as the 3rd dose in their primary series. - Children 6 months to 4 years who completed the 2-dose Moderna primary series should get the updated bivalent Moderna booster. - Children aged 5 who completed the Pfizer primary series should only get the updated Pfizer booster. - Children aged 5 who completed the Moderna primary series can get a different product for their updated booster than they got for their primary series. - People aged 6 years and older can get a different product for their updated booster than they got for their primary series or last booster. To schedule a booster shot, contact your primary care provider. \"Additional doses\" are different than a \"booster dose.\" A booster is an added dose of a vaccine that is given to someone with a healthy immune system who built enough protection after being fully vaccinated. If that protection gradually decreases, a booster can help sustain it. Third or fourth doses are provided to individuals with compromised immune systems for whom the original vaccine dose was not sufficient to achieve protection from the virus. For more information on new CDC guidance on COVID-19 vaccine additional doses for immunocompromised people, click [here.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html) Yes, the COVID-19 vaccine and flu vaccine may be given at the same time. The new boosters are \"bivalent,\" meaning they contain a combination of the original formulation and one targeting BA.5 and BA.5, now the dominant version of the virus, as well as a sister subvariant of Omicron. - People who have completed their primary series and already received one dose off the bivalent vaccine. - Children 6 months to 5 years who received the bivalent vaccine as their third shot in the primary series.
