Acupuncture What is acupuncture? Acupuncture is an ancient medical practice that dates back over two millennia and focuses on correcting imbalances in \"qi,\" the vital energy that is essential for good health. Acupuncture facilitates the flow of qi through the insertion of fine, disposable needles into different points in the body. Whenever there is a disruption in the flow of your qi, it can lead to disease and disharmony in the body. When your body exhibits symptoms, like headaches, bad digestion, or insomnia, it is signaling that there are imbalances in the body. We use acupuncture as a way of communicating with the body to signal healing and bring you back into balance. How is acupuncture different at Source Healing?

Acupuncture is used to alleviate pain and to treat various physical, mental, and emotional conditions. Research has shown that acupuncture calms the areas of the brain associated with pain, stimulates parts of the nervous system associated with rest and recovery, increases blood flow to the treated area, and reduces inflammation. At Source Healing, we specialize in treatments for fertility, stress, pain, women's health, and internal wellness such as digestive health and many other chronic conditions. We're here to help provide you with the tools you need to live a healthy life. If you have a condition you would like to ask us about, please do not hesitate to contact us. What can I expect during an acupuncture treatment? Your initial acupuncture treatment includes a thorough evaluation and intake. We will review your health history and get to know you as an individual in order to determine the root cause of your body's disharmonies. Your acupuncturist will then pick acupuncture points on the body specific to your conditions and/or concerns in order to balance out and harmonize your system. You will be guided along the way with breath-work and guided meditation to help you relax if needed, and education will be involved as well if you're curious about learning more about this beautiful medicine. We also approach acupuncture from a more emotional and spiritual perspective, so you may experience gentle intuitive energy work and mindset training if you are open to it. Because this is a full service treatment, you may also experience other adjunctive therapies within this time, such as cupping, gua sha, or moxabustion, and more if your acupuncturist recommends it for your specific case. In the following visits, we will assess your progress and make tailored adjustments to your treatments as you continue to progress. Our acupuncturists will determine the course of treatments based on your body's response. How does acupuncture feel? Will it be painful? Each body is unique, and therefore will experience acupuncture a little differently. Patients typically describe acupuncture as a tiny, mosquito- like, pinch at first, followed by a possible mild tingling sensation, body temperature shifts, and/or heaviness and achiness where needles are placed. For most, acupuncture does not hurt and some clients may feel nothing at all. Acupuncture should be a calming experience, so if you do feel any significant pain or discomfort during your treatment, please inform your acupuncturist. How will I feel after my treatment? Everyone can react to acupuncture differently, but most leave feeling calm, relaxed, and with a renewed awareness of self. Because of the therapeutic nature of our style of blending energy work, acupuncture, and mindset training, some patients experience a release of emotions and some even cry. On a physical level, less common side effects may include faint bruising, soreness, muscle twitching, and lightheadedness. Many of those experienced with acupuncture will get treatments in the middle of their work day. However, if this is your first time with acupuncture, we recommend that you have some time and space reserved for yourself to relax before jumping into a busy schedule. How many treatments will it take before I notice results? We believe that you are unique, even if your symptoms are the same as another person, and therefore you come with your own \"blueprint\" for healing. As your body begins to shift and change, so will your acupuncture treatments and herbal supplement recommendations. Your acupuncturist will communicate a treatment protocol to you after evaluation, and we highly encourage open communication via email to give updates on how you're feeling and progressing. In China, the most common treatment protocol frequency is once a day for 10 days in a row, as the effects of acupuncture are cumulative, so it is best to keep a frequent schedule in order to maintain an upward trajectory. However, most patients see us once a week, while others are more on a maintenance schedule and come in once a month to only a few times a year. What kind of needles are used for acupuncture? We use acupuncture needles that are sterile, pre-packaged, disposable, and are as thin as a strand of hair, which makes them even thinner than typical surgical needles. Needles are only used once and disposed of immediately after use. They vary in size and length depending on the area of the body where they are administered. What are the credentials of the Source Healing acupuncturists? Our acupuncturists are all licensed by the state of Illinois, National Board certified by the NCCAOM, which certifies the for both acupuncture and herbal medicine, and have a Masters Degree in Oriental Medicine, which consists of over 3,000 hours of instructions and nearly 2,000 hours of clinic hands-on experience. Additionally, all of our practitioners are trained in Western sciences and various forms of energy work that keep the treatments individualized and inspired. But beyond our qualifications and experience, we are a dynamic team of acupuncturists who have a passion for this healing art and it comes through in the quality of our treatments. We love what we do and give the kind of treatment that we ourselves would want to receive given any health issues, stress, and transition in our lives. What is the difference between acupuncture and dry needling? Acupuncture requires knowledge of theory and systems with over 3000 hours of study on Traditional Chinese Medicine. Dry needling is a tool for physical therapists aimed at affecting change in the muscle itself. It does not use the wisdom of Traditional Chinese Medicine but is instead centered on the physiology exclusively. We do not offer dry needling. Bodywork & Massage What should I wear to my appointment? You may be fully or partially clothed during your treatment. Wearing loose, comfortable clothing is recommended especially for Asian bodywork. Depending on the area of focus on your body, you may be required to remove some articles of clothing to allow for more direct contact. What is fertility massage? Fertility massage is a complementary therapy to enhance your own body's natural ability to conceive. Whether it be in conjunction with acupuncture, if you are having difficulties conceiving, or to help induce conception. It allows movement of congested lymph fluid and increases blood flow to the uterus, nourishing the entire reproductive system. It also provides physical balance to your body as a whole, as it balances Qi and relieves stress, which can hinder conception. The best time to receive fertility massage is at the end of menses to ovulation. It is not recommended during menses. The massage is administered specifically to the abdominal area, but can also be incorporated with a full body massage. Fertility massage is offered exclusively by our therapist, [Gina](https://www.sourcehealing.com/our-team). What can I expect during an Asian Bodywork session? This type of massage is offered exclusively by our therapist, [Ning](https://www.sourcehealing.com/our-team). She uses over 15 years of experience in Asian bodywork through the lens of an experienced Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner by blending Zen Shiatsu, Acupressure/Tui Na, Thai bodywork and stretching. She also infuses Cranial Sacral, guided meditation, and breath-work in her sessions depending on time allowed and need. Most patients leave feeling \"looser\" and more relaxed than when they arrived! We recommend arriving wearing clothing that is easy to move or stretch in, e.g. leggings, sweatpants, gym shorts, etc. "}
