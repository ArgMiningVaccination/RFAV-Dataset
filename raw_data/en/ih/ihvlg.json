Diabetic gastroparesis (DGP) affects life quality and glycemic control, and is a challenge to treat in both Western and Eastern medicine. Routine treatment in Western medicine includes gastric emptying promoted by prokinetic agents, gastric pacemaking, or surgery combined with lifetime hormono-therapy, all of which have unavoidable side effects and limitations, and are very expensive. Complementary and alternative medical treatments like acupuncture, moxibustion, and massage are becoming more and more attractive because of their effectiveness, fewer side effects, and reliable safety. This article aims to introduce representative methods of complementary and alternative medicine to treat DGP, which were searched in English through Pubmed and in Chinese through CNKI (China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database). Several lines of evidence demonstrated the effects of single or combined complementary alternative therapies on DGP outcomes; however, the mechanisms were rarely investigated. Randomized controlled trials are undoubtedly required in future studies.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2015-08-04", "cleaned_text": "Treatment of Diabetic Gastroparesis by Complementary and Alternative Medicines [https://doi.org/10.3390/medicines2030212](https://doi.org/10.3390/medicines2030212) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-medicines-02-00212)]. A 10-year community-based study of gastroparesis in Olmsted County showed that there was a cumulative gastroparesis incidence of 5.2% and 1.0% in Type1 and Type 2 diabetics, respectively, which was much higher than 0.2% incidence in non-diabetic people [ [2](#B2-medicines-02-00212)]. Their life quality and blood glucose control maybe influenced by delayed gastric emptying, gastric dysrhythmia, pylorus spasm, non-synchronized gastroduodenal motility, and impaired pool meal accommodation because these symptoms are known to induce malnutrition and serious glucose variability [ [3](#B3-medicines-02-00212), [4](#B4-medicines-02-00212)]. Routine Western medicine therapy for gastroparesis includes prokinetic agents, gastric pacemaking, and surgery. However, side effects like extrapyramidal symptoms, cardiac arhythmia, local infection, malnutrition, and weight loss are inevitable [ [5](#B5-medicines-02-00212)]. Acupuncture, moxibustion and massage are complementary alternative medicine techniques with reliable efficacy and fewer side effects, and are quickly becoming more widely used world-wide. Many reports have indicated that complementary alternative medicine can improve gastrointestinal motility and accelerate gastric emptying, suggesting a possible treatment approach for DGP. Here, we report the different representative methods of complementary and alternative medicines in DGP treatments, as discovered through Pubmed and CNKI in English and Chinese publications, respectively. 2. Acupuncture Treatment [6](#B6-medicines-02-00212)]. The effect of acupuncture was compared to that of domperidone by observing patients' symptom scales. The clinical efficacy rate in the acupuncture-treated group was 86.73%, significantly higher than that of the domperidone-treated control group. Acupuncture treatment exhibited a more significant effect on improving anorexia, belching, nausea, vomiting and epigastic pain compared to domperidone, and produced a more significant improvement in early satiety and bloating. Additionally, acupuncture was overall safer and produced fewer side effects than domperidone treatment. [7](#B7-medicines-02-00212)]. After eight weeks of acupuncture treatment, the total gastroparesis cardinal symptom index score (range 0-5) reduced from 2.4 to 0.6, and gastric emptying time of solid foods decreased from 135 to 93 min. The four-month follow-up examination reported complete healing of subjective symptoms, but gastric emptying scanning was not reexamined as an objective evaluation. [8](#B8-medicines-02-00212)]. The Ashi-point was located via X-ray guidance, at the upper 1/3 and middle 1/3 junction of the greater curvature along the stomach. The positive and negative electrodes of the electroacupuncture (EA) were put on Zhongwan (RN12) and Ashi-point, respectively. Both acupoint assignments produced curative properties, as displayed by gastrointestinal barium meal scanning detection. [9](#B9-medicines-02-00212)]. Furthermore, a significant decrease of glycosylated hemoglobin was found in the acupuncture-treated group, but not in the mosapride-treated group, which may suggest that abdominal acupuncture treatment is more effective than mosapride in regulating blood glucose during the treatment in weeks of time. Glycosylated hemoglobin is an irreversible biomarker for diabetes and it appears three months later than hyperglycaemia in the patient's blood. Acupuncture might improved inner physicochemical environment by control the blood glucose to regulate DGP by maintain a homeostasis. [10](#B10-medicines-02-00212)]. The total effectiveness rate of acupuncture treatment (86.7%) was significantly higher than that of domperidone treatment (55%), and blood glucose decreased more significantly in the acupuncture-treated group. Others addressed that the elongated needle on RN12 may stimulate celiac plexus and branches of vagus nerve to modulate the gastrointestinal functions [ [11](#B11-medicines-02-00212)]. [12](#B12-medicines-02-00212)]. Only one trial employed single-blinded methods. One study performed a six months' follow-up. Domperidone was used as a control treatment in eight trials, and cimetidine and mosapride were also selected as control treatments in other studies. Acupuncture-treated patients reported no adverse reactions, whereas drug-treated patients did report adverse side-effects in two trials. [13](#B13-medicines-02-00212)]. 3. Massage Treatment [14](#B14-medicines-02-00212)]. Abdominal massage improved anorexia, bloating, and epigastric pain better than mosapride treatment, but failed to show a significant difference in improving belching, nausea and vomiting. [15](#B15-medicines-02-00212)]. 4. Integrated Complementary and Alternative Medicine [16](#B16-medicines-02-00212)]. After treatment, gastric hypomotility (delayed gastric emptying) was improved more significantly in the integrated acupuncture group than that in a control group of patients treated with domperidone combined with diet management. The total effectiveness rate of the integrated acupuncture group was 97%, which was significantly more than that of the control domperidone group (87%). [17](#B17-medicines-02-00212)]. [18](#B18-medicines-02-00212)]. [19](#B19-medicines-02-00212)]. [20](#B20-medicines-02-00212)] evaluated the efficacy of manual acupuncture, EA, warm acupuncture, acupuncture combined with acupoint massage and chiropractic for 14 randomized controlled trials of DGP. This analysis found that complementary alternative medicine was more effective in improving dyspeptic symptoms like nausea, vomiting, early satiety, bloating and epigastric pain. Complementary alternative medicines were found to have equal efficacy as prokinetics. No adverse reactions occurred in alternative medicine treatment groups, whereas some mild side effects were found in some control groups. 5. Experimental Studies [21](#B21-medicines-02-00212)]. [22](#B22-medicines-02-00212)]. When acupuncture was performed at ST21 or CV6 on the abdomen, the activity of sympathetic nerve's gastric branch was excited whereas the vagus nerve of the gastric branches was slightly dampened or unchanged. However, opposite changes of autonomic nervous activity were observed when LI11 and ST36 on the limbs were stimulated. Our unpublished data in normal and DGP model rats were consistent with the previous report, never the less, the nerve activities were sparse due to hyperglycemia in the DGP model rats. Acupuncture at single or combined heterotopic acupoints increased the amplitude of gastric motility and the discharge frequency of the subdiaphragamatic vagus nerve. Acupuncture at homotopic acupoints inhibited gastric postganglionic efferent of the celiac ganglion. Homotopic acupoint stimulation exerted a dominate effect on gastric function when combined with heterotopic acupoint stimulation. [23](#B23-medicines-02-00212)]. 6. Conclusions [24](#B24-medicines-02-00212)]. Gastroparesis is a common gastrointestinal complication in diabetes, characterized by delayed gastric emptying and various upper abdominal symptoms. Previous reports have demonstrated that complementary therapy could significantly improve epigastric symptoms and gastric emptying in gastroparesis [ [19](#B19-medicines-02-00212), [25](#B25-medicines-02-00212), [26](#B26-medicines-02-00212)]. Animal experiments revealed that acupuncture could modulate gastric motility via the autonomic nervous system in normal and diabetic model rats [ [27](#B27-medicines-02-00212), [28](#B28-medicines-02-00212), [29](#B29-medicines-02-00212)]. Various complementary therapeutics exhibited possibilities for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis. PC6, RN12, ST36 are the most frequently selected acupoints when treating gastric disorders. Acupuncture at heterotopic acupoints could improve gastroparesis via excitation of vagal nerves and inhibition of sympathetic nerves. Future studies should focus on optimized treatment plans rather than efficacy verification. Additionally, the biological mechanism of acupoints used in combination should be considered. Overall, complementary and alternative medicine as affordable and safe DGP treatment options show promising future prospects. More well-designed, larger-scale, and long-term follow-up trials regarding complementary and alternative medicinesare needed to provide stronger evidence to support their utility as a favorable DGP treatment.
