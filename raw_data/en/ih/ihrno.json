Can the elderly also do yoga asanas? Yoga refreshes your mind and spirit. Tones your body. Keeps your internal organs and hormonal system in balance. All the more reason for people of all ages to do yoga. In fact, yoga asanas are one of the few physical exercises you can continue doing as you age. As age progresses, it is more important to focus on HOW YOU DO rather than how much you do. Here are some FAQs on yoga for seniors that will help you age gracefully. Can seniors (above 60 years) do yoga asanas? The word yoga comes from the Sanskrit 'Yuj', which 'to unite'. Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar says, \"Yoga is a study of life, study of your body, breath, mind, intellect, memory, and ego. Study of your inner faculties.\" It is possible for people of all ages and all walks of life to benefit from the various techniques that yoga offers. What kind of asanas should the elderly do? There is a range of standing, sitting, lying down and chair yoga asanas for you to choose from. (A) Standing yoga asanas - Hip problems are routine among seniors. Trikonasana helps strengthen and stretch the hip region. - It helps regulate blood pressure, a common complaint amongst the elderly. - Helps to keep the spine straight, preventing slouching. - Helps strengthen the arm and leg muscles, ensuring that seniors are firm on their feet.

As you grow older, it becomes even more essential to assimilate its benefits into your system. Are there any easy yoga asanas for senior beginners? You may practice Sukshma yoga independently or as part of a larger yoga plan. [Sukshma yoga](/in-en/yoga/off-yoga-mat/sukshma-yoga-exercises-relax-you-7-minutes) will help people of all ages.

The [Patanjali Yoga Sutras](/in-en/yoga/patanjali-yogasutra) define asana as \"Sthira Sukham Asana.\" That which is stable and comfortable is an asana. Any posture done with awareness in a stable and comfortable manner constitutes an asana. Keep this in mind when performing asanas. How does yoga for seniors differ from general yoga? The [yoga asanas](/in-en/yoga/yoga-poses/beginner-yoga-asanas-for-everyday) suggested for an elderly person may be the same as those for a younger individual. The difference lies in the effort and time spent in a posture, and the flexibility involved. However, if you have high endurance levels, you will be able to perform the cardiovascular movements and abdominal exercises to satisfaction. Do yoga asanas boost immunity in the elderly? Here again, the Patanjali Yoga Sutras provide a clue. \"Heyam Dukham Anaagatam.\" It means, 'Avoid the misery that has not yet come.' As we grow older, the efficiency of the immune system deteriorates, paving the way for various diseases. Regular practice of yoga techniques such as asanas, pranayama and [meditation](/in-en/node/337235) can help avoid these conditions. So make your life happier and more fulfilling with yoga. Am I getting my yoga practice right? You are the best judge of this. Check your inner gauge which is your smile-o-meter. Just do as much as you can, with a smile. That is the best indicator of whether you are doing it right or not.
