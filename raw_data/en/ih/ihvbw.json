Through the Pharmacy Plus PEI program, pharmacists can assess and prescribe, free of charge, for 32 common ailments, including cough, sore throat, seasonal allergies, heart burn, minor joint pain, thrush, and skin conditions like eczema and acne. In addition to assessing and prescribing for common ailments, community pharmacists can renew eligible prescriptions. Pharmacists will complete a review of the entire patient medication profile, including over-the-counter medications, natural products, and supplements, and renew all eligible prescriptions, as appropriate. 48 registered community pharmacies on Prince Edward Island have agreed to participate in the Pharmacy Plus PEI program. Each pharmacy will operationalize the program in a way that works best for the pharmacy and their clients. For example, some pharmacies may have dedicated hours where Pharmacists see patients eligible for Pharmacy Plus PEI services in a walk-in clinic style, some may require pre-booked appointments, while others may provide walk-in services on a first-come, first-served basis. Islanders are encouraged to connect with their local pharmacy to learn how to access the services available through the Pharmacy Plus program.

Pharmacists are trusted health care providers in communities throughout the province, large or small, and with this collaborative care approach we can provide access for timely, routine, non-urgent health care concerns for Islanders. Today's announcement with pharmacies across the Island, through the Pharmacy Plus PEI program, is an exciting example of how Patient Medical Neighborhoods will look.\" - Hon.
