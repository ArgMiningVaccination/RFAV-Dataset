In the literature, we have found that total number of medicinal plants cited in the Holy Qur'an varies author to author. Objective: The aim of this study was to indentify the plants mentioned in the Holy Qur'an and to confirm the botanical name with other relevant information and Islamic history of medicine. Methods: The Holy Qur'an has been studied thoroughly to identify the medicinal plants, and Surah and verses were only chosen if they stated specific name of plants which are found in the earth. The identity of the selected plants was confirmed and claim of ethnomedicinal uses of Qur'anic medicinal plants was vindicated using scientific evidence available in the journals and books.

Furthermore, this research analyzes ingredients, plants' classification, and the natural cures of diseases in contemporary times. Medicinal plants are an important element of medical system. These resources are usually regarded as part of cultural traditional knowledge. We present for the first time the results of an ethnobotanical survey in Kohghiluyeh va Boyer Ahmad province of Iran, conducted between 2008 and 2010. This information could be the basis of an evidence based investigation to discover new drugs.Ethnobotanical data were analyzed by use-reports in addition important indices like relative frequency of citation (RFC) and cultural importance index (CI) were calculated. Totally 23 informants were interviewed.Our study reports 138 traditionally used plant species, belonging to 52 plant families from this province. Asteraceae and Lamiaceae are the dominant locally used families. The highest number of species and application were reported for digestive system disorder, metabolic disorder and respiratory system, respectively. The part of the plant most frequently used was the aerial part (31.9%), leaves (14.8%) and fruits (11.7%). The plants are used both for medicinal and non-medicinal purposes. Daphne mucronata Royle. and Teucrium polium L. have the largest value of relative frequency of citation and cultural importance index, respectively.Kohghiluyeh va Boyer Ahmad has good ethnobotanical potential for medicinal plants. This study is the first contribution to the ethnobotany of this region. We have gathered from this province some considerable knowledge about local medicinal plants for treating common health problem that is ready to be further investigated in the laboratory.
