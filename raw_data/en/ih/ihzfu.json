Maine Law requires all degree-seeking students and full-time, non-degree students born after December 31, 1956 to provide proof of the following immunizations: - One (1) dose of Tetanus/Diphtheria (Td or Tdap) received within the last ten (10) years. - Two (2) doses of Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) received after (not on) the first birthday. If measles immunization was done prior to 1968, students must provide proof it was done with a live virus. Lab results of titer tests showing immunity to Measles, Mumps and Rubella are accepted as long as they are signed or stamped and clearly indicate immunity to all three diseases. Immunization records must indicate the date of immunization and the immunization agent, and are REQUIRED to be signed or stamped by a physician, nurse, public health official, or school health provider who administered the immunization. Official school or military health records may also be accepted as proof of immunization, as long as they were based on certificates of immunization, and state, at a minimum, the month and year that the immunization was administered. Per Maine law, a student may only be exempted from the University's Tdap and MMR immunization requirements if the student: - Provides a written statement from a licensed physician, nurse practitioner or physician assistant that, in that provider's judgment, immunization against one or more of the diseases may be medically inadvisable. To submit a request for exemption from the immunization requirements, please send an email to [um.immunizations@maine.edu](mailto:um.immunizations@maine.edu) - Is fully remote and does not physically attend any classes or programs at a facility, campus, center or site of this University or any other school.
