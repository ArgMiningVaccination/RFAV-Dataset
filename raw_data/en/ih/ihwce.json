The pillow provides essential support to your spine for extended periods of comfortable sitting to help ignite your meditation practice. The pillows are inspired by [our vision for a more sustainable world](/pages/impact-report), which we believe begins in the home, with mindfulness and conscious living. [As a Climate Neutral Certified\u00ae company](/pages/climate-neutral/), your Meditation Pillow comes with a net-negative carbon footprint, from [our farms](/pages/farm-to-mattress/) and [ factory](/pages/gots-gols-certified-factory/) all the way into your home. ORGANIC COVER Our Meditation Pillow features a GOTS organic certified removable cotton cover for easy care. You can meditate with more peace-of-mind knowing we do not use flame retardants, chemical adhesives, formaldehyde, or phthalates. Why organic cotton? Because conventional cotton is a polluted crop. Organic cotton is held to a stricter standard and ours is responsibly and sustainably grown in India without pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers. This is better for you, our family farmers, and the planet. Best of all, organic cotton delivers a luxurious finish, breathes easily, and wicks away moisture better than any synthetic. VEGAN BUCKWHEAT FILL All-natural buckwheat hulls fill our Avocado Green Meditation Pillow, creating a firm but comfortable base that adjusts to your body's curves. We cover the fill with an organic cotton inner liner, making them easy to remove and refill, so you can always keep your pillow fresh. COMPLETE THE COLLECTION We make every piece in our Organic Yoga Meditation Collection to complement one another. Pair the meditation pillow with our [Square Meditation Pillow](/products/square-meditation-pillow), [Pranayama Pillow](/products/yoga-organic-pranayama-pillow) and [Bolster](https://avocadomattress.myshopify.com/products/meditation-yoga-bolster). to melt away tension and enjoy a deeper stretch \u2014 so all you have to do is relax and focus on your breath. STORE IT WITH OUR CANVAS BAG In between yoga or meditation sessions, keep your pillow dust-free and your space tidy by storing it in our [Canvas Under Bed Storage Bag](/products/natural-canvas-under-bed-storage-bag). Handcrafted in Los Angeles from natural cotton canvas, the zippered storage bag fits perfectly underneath your bed. The 100% GOTS certified organic side handles make it easy to access, so your yoga meditation bolster is always nearby.
