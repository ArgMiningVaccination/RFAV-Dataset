Surgery for bone cancer and soft tissue sarcoma Most malignant tumors require [surgery](/services/cancer/treatments/surgery) to remove the tumor and surrounding bone and tissue. Our orthopedic cancer surgeons are experienced in many different surgery techniques to treat all types and stages of bone cancer and soft tissue sarcoma. We remove as much diseased bone as possible to avoid amputation and restore the function and appearance of the affected area. We also offer: - Allografts: Tissue that is transplanted from a donor to replace cancerous tissue that we remove - Bone reconstruction: Surgical techniques to restore the bone's function and appearance - Prosthetic implants: Custom and expandable implants to replace bone removed during surgery - Radiofrequency ablation: A minimally invasive treatment that uses electrical energy and heat to destroy cancer cells Limb-sparing surgery for bone cancer Our bone cancer surgeons perform limb-sparing surgery to remove a tumor in your arm or leg without removing the whole limb. This technique, also called limb-salvage surgery, helps preserve the use and appearance of your arm or leg. We can use this approach for more than 90 percent of patients who have osteosarcoma (a [type of bone cancer](/services/bone-cancer/types-of-bone-cancer)) in a limb. However, limb-sparing surgery can be challenging depending on the size and location of the tumor. We sometimes need to amputate the limb when people have advanced cancer or are at risk of recurrent (returning) cancer. Chemotherapy for bone cancer and soft tissue sarcoma Your treatment plan may include [chemotherapy](/services/cancer/treatments/chemotherapy-medical-oncology), infusions of powerful drugs to kill cancer cells. Your doctor may recommend chemotherapy to help shrink tumors before surgery or kill any remaining cancer cells after surgery. Chemotherapy sessions usually last one to two hours and can span several weeks or months, depending on what type and stage of cancer you have. Radiation therapy for bone cancer and soft tissue sarcoma Your doctor may also recommend [radiation therapy](/services/cancer/treatments/radiation-oncology), especially if the tumor cannot be surgically removed. You receive high doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Radiation therapy sessions usually last about an hour and can span several weeks or months, depending on what type and stage of cancer you have. We offer the most advanced radiation therapy options to precisely target your tumor and spare healthy tissue. Physical therapy [Physical therapy](/services/rehabilitation/outpatient/physical-therapy) is an integral part of your recovery after limb-sparing surgery. Our therapists offer support and guide you through exercises to help you recover limb function with a prosthesis or adapt to losing a limb.
