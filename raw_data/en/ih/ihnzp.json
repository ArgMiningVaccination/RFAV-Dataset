That makes things simple! Not everyone likes to take a handful of pills, but using a daily multivitamin supplement makes a lot of sense. It's basic and beneficial, especially in terms of getting B vitamins which are reported to help with cognitive decline and memory in older folks. [Nutrition is important](/doctor/chiropractor/chiropractic-Richmond/the-treatment-plan/nutrition). Johnson Chiropractic encourages our Richmond chiropractic patients to show us their daily multivitamin to be sure it has all the proper minerals and vitamins! MULTIVITAMIN BENEFIT Multivitamin supplementation may be quite simple and yet quite effective. A recent systematic review of research literature on the effects of high-dose, B-complex multivitamin supplementation showed support for the advantage of such supplementation in healthy and at-risk participants in terms of mental (like felt stress, concentration, general mental health, reduced anxiety), physical, and energy outcomes. [(1)](/doctor/chiropractor/chiropractic-Richmond/chiropractic-resources/references-for-chiropractic-articles#vit61423) Daily multivitamin use compared with placebo increased older adults' memory. At one-year follow-up, older multivitamin users showed significantly improved immediate recall. The researchers estimated that this multivitamin use enhanced memory performance by the equivalent of 3.1 years of aged-related memory alteration. That's a worthwhile change! Further, the researchers reported that participants still used the multivitamins routinely: 94.4% at 6 months and 91.8% at 1 year. Not bad! It's essential to take the multivitamin every day to get the most benefit. Blood samples that were obtained in a subset of participants showed increases in folate, vitamin B12 and serum 25(OH) vitamin D. One of the study's co-authors at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston said that \"multivitamin supplementation holds promise as a safe, accessible, and affordable approach to protecting cognitive health in older adults.\" Outcomes for participants who had a history of cardiovascular disease were higher than those who didn't. [(2)](/doctor/chiropractor/chiropractic-Richmond/chiropractic-resources/references-for-chiropractic-articles#vit61423) Another study showed similar results that taking a multivitamin for 3 years increased episodic memory, global cognition, and executive function in older adults. Those with cardiovascular disease seemed to benefit more than those who didn't have that. [(3)](/doctor/chiropractor/chiropractic-Richmond/chiropractic-resources/references-for-chiropractic-articles#vit61423) This is encouraging of those with cardiovascular disease to take a multivitamin with B vitamins! Johnson Chiropractic and you will have a talk at your next Richmond chiropractic visit about your cognition, your age, your multivitamin supplement routine, your multivitamin quality, and the positives of multivitamin supplementation for you! WHAT'S WITH B VITAMINS? The body utilizes B vitamins to make new cells, particularly red blood cells. B9 is folate, the natural form of B9 (as opposed to the synthetic version known as folic acid) the body can use in circulation. Methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) is a water-soluble type of natural B9 folate. Look for these. A good multivitamin with the B vitamins may be your friend! We can talk about yours.
