The Human Research Program (HRP) is essential to enabling extended pe riods of space exploration because it provides knowledge and tools to mitigate risks to human health and performance. Risks include physiological effects from radiation and hypogravity environments, as well as unique challenges in medical support, human f actors, and behavioral or psychological factors. The Human Research Program (HRP) delivers human health and performance countermeasures, knowledge, technologies and tools to enable safe, reliable, and productive human space exploration. Without HRP resul ts, NASA will face unknown and unacceptable risks for mission success and post-mission crew health. This Integrated Research Plan (IRP) describes (1) HRP's approach and research activities that are intended to address the needs of human space exploration a nd serve HRP customers and (2) the method of integration for risk mitigation. The scope of the IRP is limited to the activities that can be conducted with the resources available to the HRP; it does not contain activities that would be performed if additio nal resources were available. The timescale of human space exploration is envisioned to take many decades. The IRP illustrates the program's research plan through the timescale of early lunar missions of extended duration. The IRP serves several purposes for the Human Research Program. The IRP... \u00b7 provides a means to ensure that the most significant risks to human space explorers are being adequately mitigated and/or addressed; \u00b7 shows the relationship of research activities to expected outcomes and need dates ; \u00b7 shows the interrelationships among research activities that may interact to produce products that affect multiple HRP Elements, Projects or research disciplines; \u00b7 accommodates the uncertain outcomes of research and technology activities by including decis ion points that lead to potential follow-on activities; \u00b7 shows the assignments of responsibility within the program organization and, as practical, the proposed acquisition strategy; \u00b7 shows the intended use of research platforms such as the International Space Station (ISS), NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL), and various space flight analog environments ; and \u00b7 shows the budgeted research activities of the H RP, but does not show all 1.1 CONTEXT OF THE INTEGRATED RESEARCH PLAN budgeted activities, as some of these are enabling functions, such as manag ement, facilities, and infrastructure. There are three foundational documents to the HRP: 1. Program Requirements Document (PRD) 2. Evidence Book 3. Integrated Research Plan (IRP) The relationship of these HRP documents is i llustrated in Figure 1.1; the content and purpose of these and other documents are described in the sections that follow. HRP -47065 Rev B 2 Figure 1.1: HRP Requirements and Content Alignmen t HRP -47065 Rev B 3 1.1.1 MANAGEMENT ARCHITECTURE The development of Human Research Program content has been formulated around the \"management architecture\" of: Reviews of the accumulated evidence from medical records, space flight operations and research findings are compiled into the Human Research Program Evidence Book. These findings provide the basis for identifying the highest priority human risks in space exploration. At present, the HRP has identified 27 risks and risk factors that require research. These 27 risks and risk factors are listed in the HRP Program Requirements Document. The NASA Chie f Health and Medical Officer is responsible for maintaining NASA's Space Flight Human Systems Standards ((NASA -STD -3001, Vols 1 & 2). The Chief Medical Officer developed a system to review and document all instances where standards cannot be met, and the p lan to mitigate the risks associated with unmet standards. All instances where standards are not met can be categorized as risks to the human system. A Risk Management Analysis Tool (RMAT ) was developed to describe each risk in greater detail, including: context, evidence, likelihood, consequence, and mitigation strategy . Information in the RMAT is provided within the context of different mission scenarios. To complement the RMAT, a Master Logic D iagram (MLD) is developed to identify the most important factors that contribute to a particular risk . For each risk requiring research , HRP i dentif ies gaps in knowledge about the risk and the ability to mitigate the risk. The degree of uncertainty in understanding the likelihood, consequence and/or timeframe of a particular risk as well as its criticality to the mission(s) are the major factors that drive which research gaps are listed in the Integrated Research Plan (IRP). Ideally gaps listed in the IRP should correspond to one or more risk factors outlined in the MLDs. However, in many cases the subject matter experts selected research and development activities they considered most important prior to the availability of MLDs. The RMAT and MLD are defined in greater detail in section 1.4.1. The IRP also defines the tasks that will provide the deliverables required to fill the gaps. Research tasks are targeted at better defining a risk, or developing mitigation strategies to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. Common deliverables include recommended standards (such as Permissible Exposure Limits), flight rules (such as avoiding certain exposure levels), processes, countermeasures and technology. A major criterion for selection of a specific task is how well the proposed research provides deliverables toward closure of the gap. Specifications for the deliverables are agreed upon with customers and stakeholders of HRP products through the use of Customer-Supplier Agreements. Tasks are solicited through NASA Research Announcements, the Small Business Innovation Research program (SBIR), NASA Request for Proposals, etc., or are directed by HRP management. After the deliverables are provided, the gap is reassessed for the need for more a) knowledge or b) mitigation capability. Further rounds of research are performed until HRP and its customers agree that the gaps are adequately closed. HRP -47065 Rev B 4 1.2 PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT The HRP's top -level requirements are maintained in the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) Exploration Architecture Requirements Document (EARD), ESMD- EARD-08-07, Rev. -C. The purpose of the EARD is to translate the expectations of stakeholders, both inside and outside NASA, for the next generation U.S. s pace e xploration mission s, into requirements that will flow down to the implementing organizations. The EARD allocates the following top requirements to the HRP. \u00b7 [Ex-0061] NASA's Human Research Program (HRP) shall develop knowledge, capabilities, countermeasures, and technologies to mitigate the highest risks to crew health and performance and enable human space exploration. \u00b7 [Ex-0062] NASA's HRP shall provide data and analysis to support the definition and improvement of human spaceflight medical, environmental and human factors standards. \u00b7 [Ex-0063] HRP shall develop technologies to reduce medical and environmental risks and to reduce human systems resource requirements (mass, volume, power, data, etc.) . The PRD decomposes those requirements into lower level requirements that are then allocated to the HRP Elements. The requirements in the PRD are divided into three categories: requirements related to human system standards, requirements related to human health and performance risks, and requirements related to provision of enabling capabilities. The HRP comprises the following major Program Elements: Behavioral Health and Performance (BHP), Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC), Human Health Countermeasures (HHC), ISS Medical Project (ISSMP), Space Human Factors and Habitability (SHFH), and Space Radiation (SR). Each element incorporates its respective PR D requirements into its specific element management plan. The research elements subsequently derive a research plan to address the requirements. 1.2.1 STANDARDS The PRD requires that the HRP make recommendations for updates to the Space Flight Human System Standards, NASA -STD -3001, Volumes I (Crew Health) and II (Human Factors, Habitability and Environmental Health), and the Human Integration Design Handbook (HIDH, NASA/SP-2010-3407). NASA- STD -3001 Volume I describes Levels of Care required for human spacefligh t missions, Permissible Exposure Limits, Permissible Outcomes, and Fitness for Duty Standards for crewmembers on exploration missions, among other things, and was first baselined on March 5, 2007, by the Office of the Chief Health and Medical Officer (OCHMO). Essentially, these are the definitions of acceptable levels of risk for human health and performance associated with spaceflight. By comparing these requirements with the existing evidence and knowledge base, the HRP can identify and quantify the risks associated with human exploration missions, and derive the research necessary to lower the risk. NASA- STD -3001 Volume II provides the comprehensive set of human factors, habitability and environmental health requirements. These requirements must be met b y all NASA programs in the development of vehicles and supporting equipment utilized in human space flight exploration. The HIDH is the companion document to Volume II. The HIDH is not a standard, yet provides background data, lessons learned and offers r ecommended design solutions for meeting the requirements of Volume II. Through comparison of the requirements in Volume II (and the content of the HIDH) with the state of the art in engineering design, the HRP can identify areas where research is necessary to help system development programs meet these requirements. The HRP has two main responsibilities regarding these standards. In some cases, a NASA -STD -3001 requirement is written in generic terms to ensure its applicability to a wide range of mission HRP -47065 Rev B 5 environments (such as microgravity in orbit, lunar surface habitation, or transit to Mars). HRP research can serve to inform the standard, refine the requirement, and help define processes or methods to meet the requirement (cutting edge or state of the art). Where emerging evidence or knowledge may indicate that the standards are not written in a way that captures a complete set of relevant considerations, additional research may be conducted to facilitate an update. 1.2.2 RISKS The HRP identifies risks relevan t to the Chief Health and Medical Officer and to the health and human performance aspects of the exploration program. The HRP utilizes the Chief Medical Officer's Human System Risk Board (HSRB) to identify risks requiring research. The PRD allocates requi rements to quantify, mitigate, or monitor these human system risks to the appropriate Element within the HRP. The PRD, however, does not establish priority for the risks. The risks in the PRD are arranged in two groups based on the level of available evidence. Risks for which substantial evidence exists are listed in Table 1 while those that cannot be supported or refuted by available information at this time are in Table 2 . This IRP addresses each of the risks in the order described in Section 2.0. 1.3 EVIDENCE BOOK The HRP Evidence Book documents WHY the risks are contained in the PRD. It is a record of the state of knowledge for each risk in the PRD and, therefore , provides bases for analyses of the likelihoods and consequences for each of the risks . As such, the Evidence Book, a compilation of all the evidence- based risk reports, makes important data accessible and available for periodic review. The HRP has published all evidence -based risk reports, which are available at the following link: http://humanresearch.jsc.nasa.gov/elements/smo/hrp_evidence_book.asp . The documentation of evidence for each risk is in the form of a review article that is aimed at a scientifically -educated, non- specialist reader. The documentation is broken into the following parts: The body of each risk review contains a narrative discussion of the risk and its supporting evidence: 1. Declarative statements concerning the risk are supported by a descri ption of the evidence, whether published or unpublished. 2. Relevant published references are listed at the end of the report. 3. Data that are significant or pivotal are summarized in text, tables, and charts in sufficient detail to allow the reader to critique and draw conclusions, especially when a published reference is not available. 4. In a similar fashion, the authors indicate , as appropriate, whether the data are from human, animal, or tissue/cell/molecular studies. 5. Evidence from space flight (including biomedical research, Medical Requirements Integration Document [MRID] data, and operational performance or clinical observations) is presented first, followed by ground- based evidence (including space analog research and non -space analog biomedical or clinical research). 6. When evidence is from ground- based studies, authors discuss why these results are likely to be applicable in the space environment, offering available validation information for the use of these ground- based systems. HRP -47065 Rev B 6 The National Academies of Sciences Institute of Medicine reviewed the risk reports to validate that they provide sufficient evidence that the risk is relevant to long- term space missions. Their conclusions and recommendations are given in the IOM publication, Review of NASA' s Human Research Program Evidence Books. A Letter Report, Washington DC: The National Academies Press, 2008. As new evidence is gathered, the Risk Reports will be updated. If new evidence indicates that a risk should be retired or that a new risk should be added, the HRP will, after thorough review with the HSRB, take the appropriate action to modify the PRD and update the Evidence Book accordingly. 1.4 THE INTEGRATED RESEARCH PLAN 1.4.1 Risks 1.4.1.1. Criticality Metric The HRP utilizes a criticality metric in orde r to help the HRP program manager allocate program resources to and therefore determine the priority of each risk. The criticality score is documented in the IRP. The criticality metric is based on the degree to which the current state of knowledge about a risk will prompt the HRP Program Manager to recommend, in a forum such as the Human System Risk Board (HSRB) , \"no-go\" for undertaking a mission. Each risk has a separate criticality score for each of two mission scenario s: a lunar mission (including the lunar outpost) and a Martian mission. The criticality score has three possible values: Unacceptable, Acceptable and Controlled. The criticality score depends on both the expected value (mean value) of a risk and the uncertainty in the expected value. Th e three ratings are described in detail below. A risk is deemed to have a rating of Unacceptable if it is necessary to quantify and reduce the risk's expected value and/or uncertainty prior to the lunar o utpost or Mars missions. Rating Level: Unacceptable Context: - The current state of data and information on the risk and its mitigation and countermeasures would likely cause the HRP Program Manager to recommend, in a forum such as the HSRB, delaying a lunar outpost or M ars m issions even if all other elements of the mission were ready (e.g. launch systems, Extravehicular Activity (EVA) systems, landing and life support systems). - The lack of additional data and/or mitigation would lea ve NASA with either too high an expected value or too much uncertainty. - Unacceptable risks for lunar outpost are identified by the abbreviation LUNAR OUT POST-U and risks for Mars by the abbreviation MARS-U. A risk is deemed to have a rating of Acceptable if it is important but not necessary to quantify and reduce its expected value and/or uncertainty prior to the lunar outpost or Mars missions. Rating Level: Acceptable HRP -47065 Rev B 7 Context: - The current state of data and information on the risk and its mitigation and countermeasures would likely not cause the HRP Program Manager to rec ommend, in a forum such as the HSRB, delaying a lunar outpost or Mars missions. However, additional work could further reduce the risk's expected value or uncertainty to the Controlled category. - The lack of additional data or mitigation would leave the mission with either a significant expected value or significant uncertainty. - Acceptable risks for lunar outpost are identified by the abbreviation LUNAR OUTPOST-A and risks for Mars by the abbreviation MARS-A. Rating Level: Controlled A risk is deemed to have a rating of Controlled if it is helpful but not important or necessary to quantify and reduce its expected value and/or uncertainty prior to the lunar outpost or Mars missions. Context: - The current state of data and information on the risk and its mitigation and countermeasures would not cause the HRP Program Manager to recommend, in a forum such as the HSRB, delaying the lunar outpost or Mars missions. However, additional work could (a) further reduce the risk's expected value or uncertainty, or (b) increase engineering or operational efficiencies. - Controlled risks for lunar outpost are identified by the abbreviation LUNAR OUTPOST-C and risks for Mars by the ab breviation MARS -C. The crit icality of a risk for either a lunar or a Mars mission al one is not sufficient to determine the priority of the risk. Priority is dependent on criticality as well as other factors such as limited availability (of certain necessary resources like the Space Shuttle and the ISS), exceptionally long lead times ( e.g. needed to improve understanding and mitigation of radiation risks), or the amount of risk reduction that can be obtained with a specific set of resources. The level of activity (or budget) and timing of research investments reflects the final prioritizat ion of the risks. For reference, each risk heading in this document is labeled with an abbreviated version of the l unar and Mars criticalities. HRP -47065 Rev B 8 1.4.1.2. Risk Management Analysis Tool (RMAT) The HRP uses the Risk Management Analysis Tool (RMAT) to documen t information that influences the criticality rating of each risk and to provide a standard f ormat to assess progress toward mitigating each risk. The RMAT is complemented by a Master Logic Diagram (MLD) that is a visual representation of the set of contributory risk factors and events. 1.4.2 TASKS REQUIRED TO FILL THE GAPS (WHAT) For each risk, the appropriate HRP Elements identified gaps in the risk's state of knowledge and NASA's ability to mitigate the risk. Further, the HRP Elements identified specific research tasks required to fill each gap and the product(s) resulting from the tasks. This Integrated Research Plan lays out the risk, gaps, tasks, and resulting products in a notional schedule tied to the appropriate Exploration milestones for which the products will be needed. Additional information for most currently funded tasks can also be found in the Task Book (http://taskbook.nasaprs.com/Publication/welcome.cfm) The rationale for the selected approach is documented in the text portions of the IRP. This plan includes activities that are more than \"Research or Technology Development.\" In some cases, the activities reported in this document are not explicitly \"research\" or \"technology development,\" but are included to ensure logical completeness in describing those activities necessary to mitigate the risks. Examples are data mining activities, the results of which are pivotal in defining further steps in the research path, and hardware evaluations that would further the engineering approach to risk mitigation. Key Decision Points are built into the IRP, wherein the HRP will evaluate data with respect to closing the research gap, as well as the impact on the overall likelihood or consequence of the risk. The results of this analysis will help formul ate the next steps. In some cases, likelihood with existing countermeasures will not be high enough to warrant proceeding with more research. This risks- gaps- tasks- deliverables detail is required to ensure completeness in addressing the risks. 1.4.3 SCHEDULE DRIVERS (WHEN) The Integrated Research Plan describes a plan of knowledge production and technology development to address risks associated with human space flight. As new knowledge is gained, the required approach to research and development may change. The IRP attempts to describe a plan of research looking forward many years into the future. The fidelity of the IRP is quite high in the near term (2010-2011), but decreases with time. The IRP will be regularly revised and updated based on exploration missi on development, achievement of key milestones, and consideration of new evidence gained from the previous year. 1.4.4 RESEARCH PLATFORMS (WHERE) The HRP uses various research platforms and data sources to address gaps in knowledge. Historical data derived from ground and spaceflight studies form the basis of the HRP Evidence Reports, with the intention of ensuring that the HRP does not duplicate effort already expended. M any of these activities appear in this IRP as \"data mining ,\" although not explicitly \"research.\" Data mining involves gathering and analyzing data from historical space flights via the Long- term Surveillance of Astronaut Health and other sources, spaceflight operational data such as landing performance and simulator performance data to identify possible correlation with physiologic or psychological function, and relevant data from ground studies (NASA sponsored and otherwise). HRP -47065 Rev B 9 The HRP utilizes the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station to conduct research requir ing the unique environment of space. T he spaceflight data primarily identify and/or quantify physiological and behavioral changes to the human system occurring in the microgravity environment . The ISS is utilized to both validate potential countermeasures and as an analog for long -duration Mars missions. The use of the Shuttle and ISS platforms, in several cases, is critical to obtaining the required knowledge to build products supporting longer, more challenging missions. The Shuttle retirement in 2010 and the uncertainty in replacement transport vehicles to ISS lev y significant constraints on available flight resources; thus some research is accelerated to take advantage of these vehicles while they are available. Where possible, the HRP will utilize ground -based analog environments to perform the research required to fill gaps in knowledge, preserving the limited flight resources for only those that cannot be addressed elsewhere. There are several analog environments utilized by the HRP, some owned and operated by HRP, so me by NASA, and others operated by other agencies. Each analog environment is assessed for its characteristics that mimic portions of the flight environment. No ground- based analog can serve to simulate the flight environment completely ; thus each analog to be used is selected based on its important flight- like characteristics specific to the task objectives. S everal analogs often will be required to fill a gap , and , in all cases, analog findings are validated in the space flight environment. The Flight Analogs Project coordinates utilization of ground based research analogs to complement space research. Throughout the IRP, tasks requiring the use of specific analogs are identified. The bed rest analog mimics some of the physiological changes induced by weightlessness, using a bed rest model with a 6 o head -down tilt. The NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) analog and Antarctic missions provide mission -like settings and interactions that incorporate the constraints of working in extreme environments. The Haughton- Mars and Devon Island analogs provide rugged terrain and mission- like interactions to address specific lunar surface system concepts related to EVA and other factors related to behavioral health and performance. In some cases, th e HRP also utilizes operational mission environments, such as the Phoenix Mars Scout Lander, to obtain data relevant to the behavioral health and performance of the ground crews supporting long duration spaceflight missions. Such data provide valuable lessons for future exploration missions. Isolation chambers also provide mission- like ground- to-crew and crew -to-crew interactions that facilitate behavioral studies of team cohesion, workload, fat igue, and sleep. The NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) is a unique ground-based analog. This facility is owned and operated by the Department of Energy's (D OE) Brookhaven National Laboratory, under a contract with the HRP. HRP utilization of the NS RL is managed by the Space Radiation Program Element. 1.4.5 FUNCTIONAL DEFINITIO N OF SPACE NORMAL As NASA prepares to send crewmembers on extended exploration missions, questions arise regarding the impacts of the spacecraft and surface exploration environment on the health, safety, and performance of the explorers. For example, one of the environmental characteristics of concern is the relatively small force of gravity on the Moon, which is approximately one-sixth of that on Earth. \"Space normal\" is defined fo r this document as the normal human response to prolonged space flight. The normal human response to prolonged microgravity exposure during (and after) orbital space flight missions has received considerable research attention , but little is known about the human physiological responses to prolonged fractional gravity exposure. Thresholds, non- linearities, and system -system interactions/dependencies are all likely to affect these responses. These things will certainly be studied in crewmembers participati ng in exploration missions; however, it would be useful to know ahead of time whether any of the effects could be severe enough to cause functionally HRP -47065 Rev B 10 significant decrements in crew health, safety, or performance during these missions, so that appropriate countermeasures could be provided from the outset. All organ systems are affected by the environmental factors associated with spaceflight, although the time frame and degree of negative impact on astronaut health and performance is highly variable. The spectrum of consequences to human health and performance ranges from catastrophic decrement, through steady loss or decrement, and short-term transitional adjustment, to benign with no meaningful impact. Currently the HRP approach for each physiological condition or organ system of concern is to: 1) document the acclimated state, 2) revise crew health standards if that state is medically unacceptable, 3) if unacceptable, then determine physiological mechanisms of action, and 4) develop countermeasures as appropriate. The acclimated state is understood to represent space normal, the baseline state upon which further improvements are made. A rigorous definition of s pace norma l must consider the presence or absence of pre- existing clinical conditions and legacy counter measures, as well as variability in incident space radiation, ambient atmospheric pressure, temperature and composition; acoustics; lighting ; etc., in addition to the absence of apparent gravity. In particular, all experiments currently defin ing space normal on ISS are conducted in the presence of an exercise prescription that has varied from mission to mission and astronaut to astronaut over the first decade of ISS operations. With an accepted definition of space normal, HRP would be in a position to recommend whether or not to allow acclimation to space flight conditions, and if so, to what degree: acclimation followed by treatment just prior to or after Earth return; acclimation accompanied by in -flight monitoring and countermeasures implementation at a predetermined degree of decrement; or no acclimation permitted whatsoever. Rigorous definition of space normal for any aspect of human physiology will ultimately require flight and post-flight data . Ground based analogs are often used to prepare for, or in lieu of flight studies. 1.4.6 ELEMENTS AND PROJECTS RESPONSIBLE FOR TH E RESEARCH (WHO) Each risk is allocated to one of the research elements within the HRP , and t he IRP identifies which Element is responsible for the identified risk. Three of the HRP Elements are single- project elements: Behavioral Health and Performance (BHP), Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) and Space Radiation (SR) , and the responsible Element is identified at the risk level, but they are responsible also for all gaps and tasks addressing the risks. Two HRP Elements, Human Health Countermeasures (HHC) and Space Human Factors and Habitability (SHFH) , are multi- project Elements. Thus, the Element is identified at the risk level , and the responsible project within the Element is identified at the gap level. The following HHC abbreviations are used throughout the IRP to designate the responsible project: EPSP (EVA Physiology , Systems and Performance), ECP (Exercise Countermeasure Project), NxPCM (Non -Exercise Physiological Countermeasures), and FAP (Flight Analogs Project). The following abbreviations are used to designate the responsible SHFH project: AEH (Advanced Environmental Health), AFT (Advanced Food Technology), and SHFE (Space Human Factors Engineering). The HRP's intent is that each study is procured through competitive means, i.e., a NASA Research Announcement (NRA), Request for Proposal (RFP), etc. In some cases, due to timeliness of data, or close interconnectedness with operations or other NASA entities, the HRP will direct that a specific study be done. Criteria for these decisions are given in the HRP Science Management Plan. The current and planned procurement method for each task in this research plan is identi fied. Identification HRP -47065 Rev B 11 of any investigation as a directed study within the IRP does not signify a commitment on the part of the HRP to implement that study as a directed study without further consideration by the Program Scientist as specified in the Science Management Plan. It is the HR P's policy that all investigations sponsored by the program will undergo independent scientific merit review . This includes proposals submitted in response to NASA Research Announcements, all directed study proposals, and all unsolicited proposals. Each Element or Project within the HRP will be reviewed by an independent Standing Review Panel. The Panel's primary responsibility is to review the Element Research Plan and provide recommendations on the scientific or technological approach and portfolio content. Those element research plans ultimately serve as the input to the IRP. Modifications to element research plans will result in modifications to the annual update of the IRP. 1.4.7 DELIVERABLES OF THE RESEARCH (DELIVERABLES ) The focus of this document is to identify deliverables necessary to complete the exploration (lunar and Mars) missions. T his plan is NOT intended to mitigate risks associated with the ISS. The ISS is used as a platform to conduct research aimed at mitigating risks to the exploration missions. Some of the research may identify countermeasures, engineering, or operational solutions that would enhance the ISS and reduce risk in use (including to users) of that platform. In those cases, the HRP identifies t he necessary deliverables and insertion points for the ISS. Human health and performance risks can best be mitigated through space system design. The HRP works closely with the human exploration programs to communicate the areas of human health and performance risks, and to help inform engineering and development of the vehicle systems. Mitigation of many human health and performance risks can be accomplished through engineering design and operational constraints, and do es not need further research. De cision points in the research schedules are placed to evaluate the adequacy of the approach, research results, and deliverables to meet the intended application. The first and most desirable approach to mitigating a human health and performance risk is to engineer the risk out of the system. HRP research is intended to reduce the uncertainty in the risk and free mission timelines and design from unnecessary conservatism . To facilitate risk avoidance, the HRP identifies requirements for crew selection, an d for vehicle or mission design. Some human health and performance risks can be mitigated through application of special space medicine operations procedures. The HRP works closely with the S pace Medicine Division at JSC to evaluate the relative risks and to determine if the risks can be mitigated through known procedures. This coordination occurs through HRP participation on the HSRB. This board was established by the Chief Health and Medical Officer with chairmanship delegated to the JSC Chief Medical Officer. Members of this board consider the range of human health and performance risks, and identify those that can be mitigated through operational procedures vs. those that require further research . The risks addressed in this IRP are those identified by the HSRB as requiring research . The \"inform medical operations\" deliverables are the results of board discussions, and research results are integrated into medical requirements or flight operations procedures. The HSRB is also used to evaluate the \"deliver countermeasure\" deliverable to ensure countermeasures can be adequately transitioned to medical practice. The HSRB is also used to evaluate data at various decision points in the research. The deliverables identified in the plan as \"updates to the HSRB\" utilize the board to concur with the next steps in the research plan. HRP -47065 Rev B 12 Several other deliverables are identified throughout this IRP. Two designations are used for standards deliverables. The deliverable to \"inform standards\" represents the HRP's intent to communicate information to the OCHMO and medical operations that may help interpret the existing standard. The \"recommend update for standard\" deliverable is used when the research results are expected to change the standard. 2.0 ORIENTATION SUMMAR Y OF THE RESEARCH PL AN The IRP describes a plan of research that addresses both human physiology and the interconnected system of the human and spacecraft in a highly integrated manner. It is often not possible to address the risks simply as stand -alone units. The knowledge or mitigation gaps often appear in multiple risks. Many of the specific research tasks address multiple gaps. In the following sections, the PRD r isks are first listed by HRP element. Within each element the risks are generally organi zed by the type of consequence : short- term health (l oss of crew), mission performance (loss of mission) , and long-term health. Sections 2.1 through 2.5 provide a high- level view of the research approach to the risks. Section 3.0 arranges the detailed research plans, including text and graphics, for each PRD risk. The HRP elements are arranged in the following order: 1) Behavioral Health and Performance 2) Exploration Medical Capability 3) Human Health and Countermeasures 4) Space Human Factors and Habitability 5) Space Radiation Appendix A gives detailed information about each risks, and shows which gaps address multiple risks. The interactions between the risks, gaps, and tasks are not readily shown in a printed book. The IRP is also available in a publicly accessible database (the Human Research Roadmap @ http://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/ . In this database, the user will be able to search for such items as gaps associated with a risk, the tasks associated with a given gap, the cross- integration of a task across multiple gaps or risks, and deliverables associated with a gap or task . 2.1 BEHAVORIAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE (BHP) All BHP risks are highly interrelated . Occurrence or mitigation of a risk can be a contribut ing factor affecting another. 2.1.1 Short -Term Health 2.1.1.1 Risk of Adverse Behavioral Conditions and Psychiatric Disorders Early detection of stress or other risk factors during spaceflight is imperative to deter development of behavioral or psychiatric conditions that could seriously harm and negatively impact the individual or the crew, and pose serious consequences for accomplishing mission objectives or jeopardizing the mission altogether . Toward this end, BHP is developing methods for monitoring behavioral heal th during lunar and Mars m ission s, and adapting and refining various tools and technologies for use in the spaceflight environment. These measures and tools will be used to monitor, detect, and treat early risk factors. BHP will utilize analogs to test, further refine, and validate these measures for Exploration Missions. BHP also develops countermeasures for maintaining behavioral health and enhancing HRP -47065 Rev B 13 performance during long-duration isolated, confined, and highly autonomous missions and provides updates for behavioral health and performance standards. 2.1.2 Mission Performance 2.1.2.1 Risk of Performance Decrements Due t o Inadequate Cooperation, Coordination, Communication, and Psychosocial Adaptation within a Team While few empirical data have been collected regarding the impact of interpersonal and intrapersonal factors on spaceflight performance, it is possible that crew conflict could jeopardize long duration Exploration Missions . Reports from Mir reveal that several missions may have been terminated earlier than planned due to frictions between crewmembers, and some veteran NASA astronauts have reported crew conflict during previous space travels. Understanding the potential negative impacts of interpersonal and intrapersonal issues from spaceflight and relev ant, high fidelity analog environments is important for identifying countermeasures to aid crewmembers (ground and space) during exploration missions (e.g., Moon and Mars) where operations will require more autonomy. BHP will conduct literature reviews and interviews of crew and operations personnel to determine the most likely and most serious threats to crew cohesion, crew performance, and crew -ground interaction that might be expected for exploration missions. The interviews will be used to formulate objective measures for monitoring crew cohesion and develop approaches to enhance current training and build upon the current highly successful in-flight support services and countermeasures. These measures will be tested for feasibility and acceptability in the appropriate analog environment(s) . These tests will be followed by studies of ISS crew composition and crew cohesion/performance. As crews begin operations for long-duration missions beyond low Earth orbit, they will need to exercise increasing command and control of their daily activities . The distance for Mars m issions will result in loss of capability for real-time communication, downlink, and commanding. Likewise, the crew will have to augment and adapt their schedules based on real time changes in their schedules. The extreme distance and the duration of the planned Mars mission are at the boundaries of our current knowledge. A better understanding of how to approach and address autonomous operations and its impact on crew dynamics and performa nce will help inform standards and countermeasures. BHP is collaborating with Space Medicine in a study of crew autonomy while we are still in low Earth orbit, to identify the impact (if any) of increased autonomy on crew dynamics and performance. The BHP will test conflict management approaches in ground and analog environments, and subsequently on the ISS. 2.1.2.2 Risk of Performance Errors Due to Fatigue Resulting From Sleep Loss, Circadian Desynchronization, Extended Wakefulness, and Work Overload Ground evide nce clearly demonstrates that performance impairments can occur when sleep is attained in quantities similar to that attained by astronauts in flight. A correlation between sleep quantity and performance during spaceflight, however, has not been documented. BHP research aims to accurately characterize and quantify this Risk by implementing studies on ISS that utilize validated measures for assessing performance relative to fatigue. HRP -47065 Rev B 14 BHP research efforts further investigate contributors to sleep loss, fatig ue, circadian desynchronization, and work overload, by evaluating environmental factors, individual vulnerabilities, and various aspects of mission operations. Such investigations help to inform the optimal countermeasure strategy for mitigating the healt h and performance effects of sleep loss and related issues in flight . As an example, preliminary studies indicate that light exposure can correct difficulties in sleep patterns that occur with shift work, jet lag and sleep disorders. Current efforts aim to investigate optimal lighting requirements for the space vehicle, as well as safe and efficacious methods for implementing lighting as a countermeasure. Other countermeasures that are currently being investigated include recommendations around sleep hygiene, optimal work -rest schedules, flight rules and requirements, and the effectiveness and safety of sleep -wake medication use in flight. 2.2 EXPLORATION MEDICAL CAPABILITY (ExMC) 2.2.1 Short -Term Health 2.2.1.1 Inability to Adequately Recognize or Treat an Ill or Injured Crewmember To address this broad risk, the ExMC has broken it down into seven categories that correspond with the seven requirements allocated to the ExMC from the HRP Program Requirements Document (PRD). Each of the seven categories is then analyzed ind ividually to determine where gaps exist in satisfying the PRD requirements. Below are the seven categories into which the risk has been separated and an explanation of the strategy for addressing the different categories of gaps. 1.0 Validate Standards : The NASA HQ OCHMO Standards for Crew Selection and Retention will require changes as new medical information an d spaceflight technology become available. Additionally , NASA exploration missions may require new knowledge and/or new technology development e ither to support current standards or to modify s tandards for mission success. In either situation, the ExMC Element Scientist , through Space Medicine, will determine research needs and develop the research requirements and/or tasks necessary to fulfill this responsibility. The NASA HQ OCHMO standard s that pertain to this risk are Crew Selection and Retention Criteria. The Space Medicine Medical Operations Lead for standards, working with the ExMC Element Scientist, determines gaps in knowledge in the current Crew Selection and Retention Criteria. Tasks are then identified to close those knowledge gaps. 2.0 Quantify the Risk: Because of the limited available operational and research data, incidence rates and outcomes for relevant medical conditions have large uncertainties associated with them. The Space Medicine Exploration Condition List is analyzed to determine gaps in our knowledge about medical conditions' incidence rates and outcomes in spaceflight. Tasks are then assigned to further study, model, and use analog population data to better quantify the medical conditions. 3.0 Mitigate the Risk: Gaps in this section deal with our knowledge about effective training and telementoring programs for Exploration missions. The Space Medicine Medical Operations Lead for training, working with the ExMC Element Scientist, determines gaps in knowledge and techniques for developing future training and telementoring programs for crew, flight surgeons and biomedical ground controllers . Tasks are then identified to close those knowledge gaps. HRP -47065 Rev B 15 4.0 Monitor and Treat the Unmitigated R isk: For each Constellation Design Reference Mission (DRM), each condition on the Space Medicine Exploration Condition List is analyzed for the capabilities required to monitor and tre at the condition. An analysis is performed to determine where gaps exist in current technologies and where efficiencies could be realized in the future. Based on when a technology needs to come online, a technology watch is implemented or a technology de velopment project is initiated to deliver the technology to enable the mission. 5.0 Provide Enabling Capabilities: Provide data integration and management for HRP to ensure proper handling of data (e.g. Life Sciences Data Archive, Mission Extended Medical Enterprise). Gaps exist where these capabilities are either insufficient or incomplete. 6.0 Comply with Agency S tandards: Follow best practices and programmatic guidelines as levied by the HRP PRD. There are currently no gaps associated with this requi rement. 7.0 Reduce Resource R equirements: Wherever possible, reduce in -flight and funding resources. There are currently no gaps associated with this requirement. 2.3 HUMAN HEALTH AND COUNTERMEASURES (HHC) 2.3.1 Short -Term Health 2.3.1.1 Risk Factor of Inadequate Nutriti on As mission duration increases, the risk of nutrient deficiencies becomes greater. Nutrient requirements, delivery requirements, and the need to preserve the nutrient content in food will increase as the frequency and duration of EVAs increase on lunar and Mars missions. Nutritional countermeasures can influence all systems. Space normal must be defined for this risk; the Nutrition SMO is ongoing. Once space normal is defined, the data will be presented to the HSRB and it will be decided if countermeas ures need to be developed. In addition, several studies are ongoing to determine the optimal dose of vitamin D. 2.3.1.2 Risk of Bone Fracture Risk of Bone Fracture and Risk of Early Onset Osteoporosis due to Spaceflight These two risks are highly interrelated ; the occurrence or mitigation of one risk possibly affects the other. The combined research risk approaches are presented below. It is currently possible to 1) track the course of changes in bone mineral density and bone quality during long duration missions, 2) determine if bone losses will occur during a Mars visit, and 3) know such information to determine the risk of fracture upon return to Earth after a Mars mission . However, these capabilities are not a part of any requirements documents for lunar o r Mars missions. Currently there are indications that , even after 6 -month missions, bone quality/strength does not recover as quickly as bone mineral density. This may represent a long- term health effect (increased osteoporosis and fracture risk) related to this discordant recovery dynamic. This information is required for assess ing long -term health risks to returning crew. While bone atrophy during spaceflight is known and requires mitigation, the time course of in -flight bone changes, the time course of post- flight recovery , and individual susceptibilities have not been determined. The 2007 NASA Research Announcement was utilized to solicit and select proposals to HRP -47065 Rev B 16 gather these space normal data. In addition, work is ongoing with the Space Medicine Divi sion to obtain long-term recovery data. The long- term goals are to develop and deliver countermeasures for long- term missions while tracking the efficacy of these countermeasures to prevent increased lifetime health risk. Due to schedule constraints, countermeasure development has been started in parallel with space normal data collection and technology development. The fracture risk for bone is related to the applied load- to-bone ratio and to the fracture load of bone. Thus, the increased fracture risk induced by spaceflight is suggested collectively as an adaptive response to the a ccelerated loss of bone mass, to weightlessness, and to reduced gravity fields experienced during missions , as well as to the loads and torques that the skeleton is subjected to while tasks are performed during the missions. The most critical work needed for this risk is the measures of in-flight changes in bone mass over the course of ISS missions. This allows the prediction of temporal changes in bone mass during Mars missi ons. Those data will provide a basis for evaluating whether the expected loads/torques to bone during human performance on a mission will exceed the failure load of bone (i.e., fracture load). This knowledge will drive mission operations planning. The Ri sk of Bone Fracture deals with a fracture occurring during a mission. A fracture considered of \"high\" risk is characteristic of osteoporosis, a disease characterized by losse s in bone mass and by structural deterioration. Therefore, gaps and tasks that f all under the Risk of Early Onset Osteoporosis are also mapped to the Risk of Bone Fracture. The only current independent gap for the Risk of Bone Fracture is the unknown incidence of vertebral compression fractures. The task associated with this independent gap is being completed by the Space Medicine Division. 2.3.1.3 Risk of Cardiac Rhythm Problems Heart rhythm disturbances have been seen among astronauts. Most have been related to cardiovascular disease, but it is unclear whether this was due to pre- existing conditions or to the effects of space flight. It is believed that advanced screening for coronary disease has greatly mitigated this risk. Other heart rhythm problems, such as atrial fibrillation, can develop over time, necessitating periodic screening of crewmembers' heart rhythms. Beyond these terrestrial heart risks, some concern exists that prolonged exposure to microgravity may lead to heart rhythm disturbances. Although this has not been observed to date, further surveillance is warranted. Space normal must first be defined for this risk and data mining tasks are ongoing. Once the definition is determined, the data will be presented to the HSRB and it will be decided if countermeasures need to be developed. The HRP will conduct a comprehensive study that integrates the objectives of two NRA investigations and a SMO , involving both intramural and extramural investigators. In -flight testing will require Holter monitoring, two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography, and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. After completion of th e study, the clinical expression of cardiac atrophy during long- duration spaceflight will be defined clearly, and its significance for cardiac systolic and diastolic function at rest and during gravitational transitions will be elucidated. In addition, preliminary information will be obtained regarding ventricular conduction and re- polarization that will provide either strong clinical reassurance, or pathophysiologic insight into the risk for cardiac arrhythmias. Based on the o utcome of this investigation, the HRP will determine if countermeasures are necessary to prevent these conditions. HRP -47065 Rev B 17 2.3.1.4 Risk of Compromised EVA Performance and Crew Health due to Inadequate EVA Suit Systems To ensure completion of the physical tasks of the mission, the EVA suit system must allow safe and efficient performance of critical mission activities outside the habitat or vehicle . The Human Research Program has tasked the EVA Physiology, Systems, and Performance (EPSP) Project to work with the Constellat ion EVA Systems Project Office to develop and execute an integrated human testing program across multiple environments to collect objective data needed to make informed design decisions in creating an EVA suit system that will optimize human health and per formance. The research approach is to evaluate variables affecting human EVA performance, such as metabolic cost and biomechanics of different suit designs and operational concepts; and impacts of suit weight, mass, pressure, center of gravity (cg), and the quantities of consumables required to support EVA. Other research tasks will determine biomedical monitoring requirements, methods to minimize suit- induced trauma, and operational concepts to improve work and task efficiency. This work will be done as a series of inter - related ground studies using multiple analog environments including, but not limited to, the Partial Gravity Simulator (Pogo) and Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) at the Johnson Space Center, parabolic flight, Desert Research and Techno logy Studies (D-RATS), the Haughton Mars Project (HMP), and NEEMO. 2.3.1.5 Risk of Crew Adve rse Health Event due to Altered Immune Response There are no procedures currently in place to monitor immune function or its effect on crew health. Immune dysregulation has been demonstrated to occur during spaceflight, yet little in -flight immune data have been generated to assess whether or not this may be a clinical problem. Thus, HRP will conduct the \"Integrated Immune SMO\" to assess the clinical risks resulting from the adverse effects of space flight on the human immune system and will validate a flight-compatibl e immune monitoring strategy. The correlation between in -flight immunity, physiological stress and a measurable clinical outcome (viral reactivation) will be determined for long- vs. short -duration space flight. Data from this study will be combined with the results from Shuttle -based immune studies to inform and update health standards. Additionally, ground analogs such as NEEMO will be evaluated to determine if they represent a good analog for short-duration spaceflight. This immune dysregulation analog will be validated for some aspects of that dysregulation if it is observed in the NEEMO crews (similar to that already observed in flight crews during/following spaceflight). Data from ground studies and the Integrated Immune SMO will be assessed to determine countermeasure development needs. 2.3.1.6 Risk o f Inte rvertebral Disc Damage Evidence from medical operations indicates that astronauts have a higher incidence of intervertebral disk damage than the general population. Additional work to determine the extent of this problem should be done. Once completed, the findings will be used to guide the design of re-entry and post-flight protocols, as well as future re -entry spacecraft, as appropriate. 2.3.1.7 Risk o f Renal Stone Formation Space normal must first be defined for this risk . Data mining tasks are ongoing. Once space \" normal \" is defined, the data will be presented to the HSRB and a decision of whether countermeasures need to be developed will be made . The evidence establishing the risk factors and/or the likelihood of risk occurrence for renal stone formation is either known or in progress. The activities in this area are intended to compile data related to the r isk of renal stone formation, from medical data and from r aw research data used for previously HRP -47065 Rev B 18 published reports . From these data, the task is to determine primary and other risk factors for renal stone formation, particularly regarding the types of stone s formed (to identify the specific risk factor and appropriate countermeasure), the correlation with diet, and the time course for formation. Ground data mining and final analysis of the previous Renal Stone Flight Study will be used to determine if further work is warranted for this risk . 2.3.1.8 Risk o f Therapeutic Failure due to Ineffectiveness o f Medication Better recordkeeping of medication use, its effectiveness, and the side effects produced (if any) should be instituted. This will provide evidence for or and should be a precursor to a formal assessment of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) on orbit. It is believed that gastrointestinal (GI) motility and function is not an issue after the first few days of flight. In general, Space Medicine avoids prescribing oral medications during this period of the mission. It is not known to what extent different volumes of distribution might be a factor in flight. Drugs selected for the PK/PD studies should be commonly used, and have few side effects, and different metabolic pathways. External consultants should be used to determine which drugs to test and to design testing protocols. Space Medicine needs to develop a process and procedures to systematically track crew medication use, including subjective comments on efficacy and side effects, particularly for ISS. It is very important to know what pharmaceuticals are taken prior to in- flight tasks. The overarching strategy for this risk is to obtain better record keeping of medication use, efficacy, and side effects. This includes several data mining tasks, which will provide evidence for or against this risk. If evidence indicates the ineffectiveness of medications, a PK/ PD study will be performed in flight to obtain further information. 2.3.2 Mission Performance 2.3.2.1 Risk of Impaired Control of Spacecraft, Associated Systems and Immediate Vehicle Egress Due to Vestibular/Sensorimotor Alterations Associated with Spaceflight New evidence regarding landing performance indicates that research into these types of issues is not a high priority for Shuttle or ISS. However, since Mars operational scenarios are still TBD, it is agreed that the ISS should be utilized to gather the data required to define the research that might be needed to enable future Mars mission o perations. It first must be determined what relevant spaceflight data exist and if they are accessible. If so , they must be analyzed; if not, the data must be collected . In addition, performance related to neurosensory dysfunction should be used to dete rmine the need for further research and countermeasure development. Space normal must first be defined for this risk; data mining tasks are ongoing. Once the definition is in place, the data will be presented to the HSRB, and a determination made on whether countermeasures need to be developed. In addition, the NRA solicitation process was utilized to obtain proposals to determine any manual and visual control deficits. 2.3.2.2 Risk of Impaired Performance due t o Reduced Muscle Mass, Strength a nd Endurance 2.3.2.3 Risk of Reduced Physical Performance Capabilities due to Reduced Aerobic Capacity These two risks are highly interrelated . Occurrence or mitigation of one risk can be a contributing factor affecting the other. Their research approaches are given together. Human physiology's \"normal\" response to spaceflight has not been determined for these risks. Several studies have been implemented to determine how muscle and aerobic capacity are affected by HRP -47065 Rev B 19 microgravity; these studies include the new Integrated Resistanc e and Aerobic Training study, the Functional Task Test and the VO 2max study. The Integrated Resistance and Aerobic Training study will apply principles learned from ground- based flight analogs to an in-flight platform in order to improve exercise counter measures efficacy and efficiency by increasing exercise intensity and reducing exercise volume. Data will guide the decision about whether current exercise countermeasures are protective or if improved countermeasures requiring flight validation studies are needed. The Functional Task Test will be implemented as a flight study as well as a bed rest study. The goal of this study is to develop and evaluate an integrated set of functional and physiological tests and then use these tests to determine how po stflight changes in sensorimotor, cardiovascular and muscle physiology impact postflight functional performance. These tests will be performed pre and postflight on astronauts exposed to short- and long-duration space flight. The Functional Task Test will assess operational relevance of these changes by measuring the performance of specific exploration tasks (e.g., simulated seat egress, ladder climb, hatch opening, etc.). Additionally changes in functional performance will be mapped for standard muscular, neurological, and cardiovascular measures. Data obtained from this study will facilitate the design of countermeasures that specifically target the physiological systems responsible for impaired functional performance. The specific aims of the VO 2max s tudy are to measure VO 2max during and following long duration missions and to assess the validity of using submaximal measurements of heart rate (HR), and oxygen consumption (VO 2) to track changes in aerobic capacity. In addition, non- invasive measurements of cardiac output (Qc) will be performed during exercise to determine if measurement of Qc will improve the accuracy of the submaximal estimations of VO 2max. Results from this study will determine if the current countermeasures are protective and need on ly optimization (e.g., reduced volume, time) or if improved countermeasures and flight validation studies are needed. Due to scheduling constraints with the loss of the Mars transit analog in 2020, several concurrent studies are ongoing. 2.3.2.4 Risk of Orthostat ic Intolerance during Re-Exposure to Gravity Twenty percent of Shuttle crewmembers and up to 83% of returning ISS crewmembers suffer hypotension and presyncope or syncope during 10 minutes of upright tilt on landing day. This may constitute a risk when cr ewmembers experience Earth's gravity after exposure to microgravity. Currently available countermeasures are not effective in all crewmembers; in particular, women are more susceptible to orthostatic intolerance than men are. While it is well known that crewmembers can be incapacitated by orthostatic intolerance after six -month missions when they return to E arth's gravity, the degree to which this may be ameliorated in the gravity environment on the M artian surface is not known. Early surface operations may require astronauts to be upright and active soon after landing on Mars. A combination of countermeasures, both physical and pharmaceutical, should be pursued for this risk. It is not known if exposure to 1/6 g and 3/8 g will cause orthostatic intoler ance or will have mitigating effects on orthostatic intolerance upon return to 1 g . Space normal has been defined for this risk. C urrent research efforts are investigations to determine the efficacy of new countermeasures (i.e., Jobst stockings and pharmacological agents). The new lunar analog currently under development will be utilized to understand the role of the lunar gravity as protection from orthostatic intolerance. In addition, gender effects and the possibility for gender-specific countermeasur es are also being investigated. HRP -47065 Rev B 20 2.3.3 Long- Term Health 2.3.3.1 Risk of Early Onset Osteoporosis due t o Spaceflight 2.3.4 Infrastructure 2.4 SPACE HUMAN FACTORS AND HABITABILITY (SHFH) 2.4.1 Short -Term Health 2.4.1.1 Risk of Adverse Health Effects due to Alterations in Host -Microorganism Int eraction While current preventative measures limit the presence of many of the medically significant microorganisms during a mission, infections cannot be completely eradicated. Evidence indicates that certain microbial characteristics of microorganisms w hen microbes are cultured in spaceflight . These alterations include changes in virulence (disease -causing potential). As a result of this evidence, the HRP plans to compare microbial diversity, microbial characteristics, and specific host-microorganism interactions between spaceflight and ground-based conditions. This comparison, in combination with evidence from investigations of potential changes in crew susceptibility will be used to determine the risk of microbiologically- induced adverse health effects during a spaceflight mission. Using this microbial risk assessment, the HRP will determine if current operational and engineering controls used to mitigate these microbiological risks during human exploration of space are adequate or whether additional countermeasures should be developed. 2.4.1.2 Risk of Adverse Health Effects of Lunar Dust Exposure The toxicological effects of lunar dusts have not been studied in sufficient detail to develop an exposure standard for operations on the lunar surface. Lunar dust has properties that raise concerns for human health. Lunar dusts have a high content of respirable size particles, have large surface areas that are chemically reactive, and \"nano -particles\" of highly reactive elemental iron (Fe 0) are imbedded in a \"rind\" at the surfaces of the particles. These unusual properties may cause the respirable dusts to be at least moderately toxic to the respiratory system, and the larger grains to be abrasive to the skin and eye. NASA needs to set a permissible exposure limit (PEL) for airborne lunar dusts that is based on scientific evidence so that designs of vehicles and habitats will include features that restrain concentrations of airborne dust within safe limits. Operations must be designed to minimize the risk of abrasion to skin and eyes. Research will evaluate and characterize factors that contribute to toxicity of the lunar dust, and then a recommendation for a PEL that accounts for these factors will be developed in collaboration with the Lunar Airborne Dust Toxicity Assessment Group (LADTAG). The HRP has committed to recommending this standard in 2010, when it is needed to support development of lunar operations concepts. Studies will determine size distributions, shape characteristics, and chemical composition of lunar particulates. Studies of the activation of lunar dust will utilize analogs of processes that activate dust on the lunar surface to reactivate lunar samples that have been passivated by exposure to air. Grinding will be used as a surrogate for micrometeori te bombardment, hydrogen and helium ion implantation will simulate the effects of solar wind, and lamps will substitute for the sun as sources of ultraviolet HRP -47065 Rev B 21 radiation. Understanding the processes of activation, and of passivation of reactive dust in a habitable environment (for example, by water vapor and oxygen), are essential to assessment of the potential health effects of exposure to lunar dust and establishing appropriate limits for exposures that could occur subsequent to mission- related tasks. Activ ation and rates of passivation will be assessed by measuring the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in solutions containing dust, and by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Activated and passivated dusts will be tested in toxicology studies to determine the extent to which chemical activation may contribute to toxicity of the lunar dust. Research on the unique properties of lunar dust will also advance our understanding of the mechanisms by which contact with or inhalation of lunar dust may affect human systems. In vivo studies will include inhalation toxicity and intratracheal instillation (ITI) testing of lunar dust. Gross pathology and histopathology will be performed to gather evidence of the degree and nature of the pulmonary toxicity of lunar dust. The biochemical and cellular responses of the lung to insult by lunar dust will be determined by examination of markers of toxicity measured in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid. Several crewmembers reported dermal and ocular issues res ulting from exposure to lunar dust during the Apollo missions. Although there are anecdotal reports, there are no objective scientific data to provide a basis for estimating the extent of dermal and ocular hazards that may be present during lunar operations. Therefore, ground studies, in which simulants and authentic lunar dust will be utilized with tissue -equivalent models and animal models, will be conducted to provide a basis for estimating the extent to which acute and chronic contact with lunar dust might impair crew vision or compromise the barrier function of the skin. Data from these studies will also be made available to operations personnel and clinicians so they may be considered in the formulation of operations procedures or guidelines for treatment of injuries resulting from contact with lunar dust. 2.4.1.3 Risk of Performance Decrement and Crew Illness Due To an Inadequate Food System Studies of the stability of food nutrients will identify vitamins and amino acids at risk for degradation in space fo od supply; identify changes in fatty acids of foods flown on ISS, and characterize degradation profiles of the unstable nutrients. A ground study uses radiation exposure to test the stability of various food and pharmaceutical components; the results of the study will be compared to ongoing flight data being collected. The shelf life of the current thermostabilized food products has never been determined. Food items with varied formulations and bulk ingredients are now in accelerated shelf life testing. The approach will provide critical information about the susceptibility of vitamins in the space food system to adverse environmental factors and storage encountered during space missions. The Advanced Food Technology Project is responsible for optimizing methods required to preserve, package, and ship, stow, and prepare the food while still preserving the nutritional value. The nutritional content of the flight food items is not currently measured. However the retort, irradiation, and freeze-drying processes used to produce shelf stable products, reduce the nutrient content. The nutrient levels in prepared foods will be measured to ensure that they meet the requirements of nutrition as specified by the nutrition standards and as determined through the Nutrition SMO mentioned above. If the nutrient levels are not adequate, other preservation methods that maintain the nutrient content of the foods will be investigated. HRP -47065 Rev B 22 Reducing the flight resources required for the food system is a major goal due to the signifi cant ratios of rocket size to mass per pound of cargo delivered on an exploration mission. Methods to reduce packaging mass and volume overhead will be studied. These studies must overcome challenges such as storing food for extended periods (i.e., 18 months for ISS, up to 5 years for a long duration mission having pre-positioned food). Food packaging materials must be developed that minimize the mass required, while providing an adequate oxygen and moisture barrier to maintain the required shelf lives. 2.4.2 Mission Performance 2.4.2.1 Risk of Error due t o Inadequate Information This risk focuses on identifying the sources of crew performance errors. The lack of situational awareness that might be due to poorly designed interfaces or tasks is such an example. T he su bsequent development of information-presentation standards reduc es operator errors in spaceflight through adequate understanding of the causes and mitigations of the errors. As the topic of inadequate information is comprehensive, the approach to mitigating this risk is to focus on the display of information, the types of controls that interface between the human and the displays, and the procedures to accomplish tasks. It is not possible to separate the strategy for mitigating this risk from the strategy for dealing with the Risk of Errors due to Poor Task Design. The information that is needed to perform a task at a given time depends substantially on the nature of the task and the crewmembers' roles and responsibilities. The work described under this r isk presumes the task is well designed, and focuses on the problems of ensuring that necessary information is presented so a timely, accurate performance is accomplished . 2.4.2.2 Risk of Errors Due to Poor Task Design The risk associated with designing tasks focuses specifically on the process of assigning roles and responsibilities to individual crewmembers, a group of crewmembers, automation, ground support or various combinations of actors. SHFE specifically studies issues in designing tasks to be performed jointly by humans and automation, and deciding how much responsibility to assign to an automated system. The approach to mitigating this risk is to develop and specify \"best practices\" for 1) human- automation function allocation , human automation interface design, 2) incorporation considerations for crew workload and situational awareness in mixed-initiative operations concept design, and 3) determination methods that ensure effective levels of trust between the crew and automation while avoiding unacceptabl e levels of crew complacency. To mitigate this risk, it is necessary to develop an adequate understanding of human characteristics with respect to automation, determine optimal workload levels, and understand situational awareness. Ways to mitigate this risk will include establishing requirements and guidelines for human interfaces with automation. This leads into the Risk of Error due to Inadequate Information. The risks of Inadequate Information and Poor Task Design are highly interrelated to the Risk of Impaired Ability to Maintain Control of Vehicles and Other Complex Systems under the HHC Element. Occurrence or mitigation of one risk can be a contributing factor affecting another. The strateg ies for addressing these three risks are intertwined . The w ork described under the Poor Task Design risk focuses on planning how a given task or mission objective will be accomplished, as well as on how to decide what skills, tools, equipment , and information are needed to accomplish a task . It also provides tools and guidelines for determining optimal combinations of automation and human involvement. Work under the Inadequate Information risk contributes to the crew having adequate HRP -47065 Rev B 23 knowledge, skills, and information at the time the task needs to be performed. The third r isk, Impaired Ability to Maintain Control, specifically addresses impairment in the sensorimotor system due to changes in gravity, and work focuses on searching for means to minimize the impact of these changes on performance. 2.4.2.3 Risk of Reduced Safety and Efficiency d ue to an Inadequately Designed Vehicle, Environment, Tools or Equipment This risk focuses on the overall environment in which the crew lives and works, which influences the development of hardware and interfaces, as well as how those interfaces will facilitate human performance and efficiency . Displays, controls, and procedures need to be appropriately designed and developed to a llow safe and efficient execution of tasks. Specific studies investigate the environment (s) surrounding the crew, namely the acoustic environment, which can influence both health and performance. Other studies focus upon the vibration, acceleration, and microgravity environments, again all having potential to impact human health and performance. The approach to mitigating this risk is to develop a thorough understanding of the operational concepts, and determine the methods, the metrics, and the verification strategies to ensure that both hardware and environment are designed for human safety and productiv ity. 2.5 SPACE RADIATION (SR) The radiation risks are highly interrelated. The occurrence or mitigation of one risk can be a contributing factor affecting another , so t he research approaches are given together. The radiation element uses data from all fund ed studies and provides the integrating component through development of risks assessment tools and design tools. When critical deliverables are needed such as at mission or vehicle SRR/SDR, or crew selection, or for key development of operational product s, the radiation element will serve an advisory function, using the output of the latest independently verified and validated tools. Thus, the many deliverables will not usually map to the end of a specific study, but rather are planned to occur at the key milestones when they are needed. However, tools utilized in the design and development of vehicles will be delivered prior to PDR and CDR to be utilized during the design and analysis cycles. 2.5.1 Long- Term Health 2.5.1.1 Risk o f Radiat ion Carcinogenesis Near -term goals for cancer research focus on reducing the uncertainties in risk projections through the development of tissue specific models of cancer risks, and the underlying mechanistic understanding of these models, and appropriate data collection at the NSRL. In the long term, extensive validation of these models with mixed radiation fields is envisioned and research on biological countermeasures and biomarkers will be pursued if needed. Research on improving cancer projections has two major emphases: 1) testing the correctness of the National Council on Radiation Protection (NCRP) model and 2) reducing the uncertainties in the coefficients that enter into the cancer projection model. Research on the validity of the NCRP model relies on studies at the NSRL observing qualitative differences in biological damage between HZE nuclei and gamma rays and the establishment of how these differences relate to cancer risk. There are distinct mechanisms of cancer induction across and within major tissue sites, and uncertainty reduction requires tissue specific risk estimates. NRA and NASA Specialized Center of Research (NSCOR) proposal selections focus on these major sites: lung, breast, colon, stomach, esophagus, the blood system (leukemias), liver, bladder, skin, and brain. There HRP -47065 Rev B 24 are differences in radiation sensitivity based on genetic and epigenetic factors and research in these areas aids the development of tissue- specific cancer models. The approach to risk quantification and uncertainty reduction is based on modifying the current model for projecting cancer incidence and mortality risks for space missions. The cancer rate is the key quantity in the evaluation, representing the probability of observing a cancer at a given age and year s since exposure . The life -span study of the Japanese survivors of the atomic bomb is the primary source for gamma ray data. M ore recently , however, meta -analysis of data for several tissue types from patients exposed to radiation or re actor workers has become available. These newer data are being used to check or replace the Japanese data. Other assumptions in the model are made with regard to the transfer of risk across populations, the use of average rates for the U.S. population, age, and age- after exposure dependence of risk on radiation quality and dose rate, etc. Collaborative research with the D OE Low Dose Research Program is a key component of the strategy. The D OE program focus is on low Linear Energy Transfer (LET) irradiation; collaborative grants are also being selected from proposals that contain one or more Specific Aims addressing NASA interests using the NSRL. This research augments SR research with a large number of grants that use state -of- the art approaches, i.e., genetics, proteomics, and transgenic animal models, etc. The D OE research is an important part of the goal to identify biomarkers of cancer risk. Determining the shape of the dose-response model for cancer induction is a near- term focus that is enumerated in biological terms through various cancer Gaps. In the NCRP model, the relationship between dose and response is linear and the slope coefficient is modulated by radiation shielding. Models of non- targeted cancer risk describe processes by which cells traversed by HZE n uclei or protons produce cancer phenotypes in regions of tissue not limited to the traversed cells. Non-targeted effects are the major mechanism that has been identified that is in disagreemen t with the NCRP model, and they show a sub -linear dose response. The implications of such a dose response for cancer risk are large since such a model predicts a reduced effectiveness for radiation shielding . The importance of mission length is also affected by the sub -linear dose response. Research in this area is a major focus of studies at NSRL. For some cancer sites and exposure conditions, for proton exposures, the NCRP model may be adequate . NSRL r esearch is focused on reducing the uncertainties in the model through the establishment of tissue- specific model s of human cancers, and on collection of data at NSRL for a varie ty of ground- based analogs for solar particle event (SPE) and galactic cosmic r ays (GCR). Systems biology models provide a framework to integrate mechanistic studies of cancer risk across multiple levels of understanding ( molecular, cellular, and tissue), and are the most likely approach to replace the NCRP model. Systems biology models are being developed by the Risk Assessment Project and several NSCORs, and , in conjunction with data coll ection , will improve the descriptions of cancer risk , laying a framework for future biological countermeasure evaluations and biomarker identification. 2.5.1.2 Risk of Acute or Late Central Nervous System Effects f rom Radiation Expos ure A critical question for the current phase of research is to establish possible threshold doses for specific CNS risks. Central nervous system (CNS) risks from GCR are a concern due to the possibility of single HZE nuclei traversals causing tissue dam age as evidenced by the light-flash phenomenon first observed during the Apollo missions. Also, as survival prognosis for patients irradiated for brain tumor treatment has improved, patients have shown persistent CNS changes at times long after treatment with gamma rays suggesting a possible CNS risk for a large SPE. Furthermore, animal studies of behavior and performance with HZE radiation suggest detrimental changes may occur during long- term GCR exposures. Currently, there is no projection model for CNS risks of concern to NASA. The values of HRP -47065 Rev B 25 possible thresholds for CNS risks and knowledge on how to extrapolate possible thresholds to individual astronauts is a key milestone in the long- term research plan. 2.5.1.3 Risk of Degenerative Tissue or other Health Effects f rom Radiation Exposure Recently several epidemiological studies, including results from the atomic -bomb survivors and nuclear reactor workers, have identified an increased risk of stroke and coronary heart disease ( CHD) for low-LET radiation at doses comparable to those of a Mars mission, or a lunar mission incurring a large SPE. Because the risk of heart disease is a recent finding, preliminary studies in these areas are seeking to establish possible distinctions, in mechanisms for this risk , between protons, HZE nuclei , and gamma rays. As an adjunct , SRPE will take advantage of studies by the European Union in this area, wherein the Union is supporting large- scale mouse studies of CHD. These studies should present new insights into the nature of the low LET (gamma- ray) risk at low dose -rates comparable to space conditions, and should identify appropriate mouse strains to be used in future SR studies. Cataracts have long been a research focus of SR. An increased r isk of cataracts associated with low - dose space radiation has been reported from past NASA missions, and is being followed up with a clinical study of cataract progression rates in current or retired astronauts. Several NSRL studies of risks are supporte d to improve the understanding of how protons and HZE nuclei induce cataracts, and to identify possible countermeasure approaches. As well, SRPE continues to support studies to improve the understanding of how protons and HZE nuclei induce cataracts and to identify possible countermeasure approaches. 2.5.2 Short -Term Health 2.5.2.1 Risk o f Acute Radiation Syndromes due t o Solar Particle Events A variety of acute radiation syndromes are of concern following a large SPE exposure. Radiation sicknesses, i.e., the prodromal risks, include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue. These effects are manifested within 4 to 24 hours post-exposure for sub- lethal doses , with a latency time inversely correlated with dose. Furthermore, there is a rea sonable concern of a compromised immune system, due to high skin doses from a SPE leading to burns, or other flight factors, although the possibility of acute death through the collapse of the blood forming systems is negligible. One research emphasis is to pursue the role of the immune system in acute risks. Animal and cell culture models and possible countermeasure approaches to acute risks are expected to be distinct from those for cancer and other radiation risks. In the long-term, the SR will consider research on fertility, sterility, and heredi tary risks from space radiation. 3.0 ELEMENTS INPUT DESCR IPTION LOCATED IN APPENDIX A The format for the Elements' inputs includes graphical depiction via Gantt charts and written discourse to clarify the Eleme nt approach. Each input follows the same form. Each risk in the purview of that Element is reported, along with its criticality to the Lunar Outpost mission and the Mars mission ; the operational r elevance is described ; the strategy for mitigation is give n; the gaps in knowledge are reported with a brief description ; and the activity or activities necessary to address the gap are described. For each activity, the resulting product/deliverable, the required delivery milestone for the deliverable, the requi red platform , and the Project or organization responsible for implementing the activity are all defined. HRP -47065 Rev B 26 3.1 RISKS Each text description has a statement of the risk. These statements are verbatim from the PRD, and are reprinted in the IRP as a matter of conve nience for the reader. With the title of each risk, the criticality is given. Criticality ratings correspond to the criteria given in S ection 1.4.1 of this document. 3.2 CONTEXT This section provides the context of how the research plan is built for that risk and describes the need for the research at a very high level. 3.3 OPERATIONAL RELEVANC E In this paragraph, a description of the relevance to the exploration mission is given. 3.4 STRATEGY FOR MITIGATION The approach strategy for the mitigation of the risk is outlined in this section . For instance, the strategy may be to first determine space normal physiology, then identify specific countermeasures. 3.5 GAPS Gaps in our knowledge or in the evidence base exist for each risk. These gaps have several different form s. A gap may exist in our evidence base, which leaves greater uncertainty regarding the likelihood of the risk. A gap may exist in the identification of the appropriate countermeasure. For othe r risks, the gap may be in the flight validation of the appropriate countermeasure. For the purposes of this IRP, the gaps are not delineated by type; rather they are simply identified as gaps that must be filled before the risk is mitigated. In some cases, a gap may not require research to close it; the gap can be avoided altogether through selection of a specific Constellation design. 3.6 TASKS For each gap, the task(s) required to fill th at gap are listed. Each task is named and a short description is given. In some cases, a task can address multiple gaps across multiple risks. To limit the size of this document, a task that addresses more than one gap is named and described once and the description is referred to in the other gaps that it is intended to fill. In addition, the project responsible for implementation of the task is listed , along with the anticipated procurement method. In some cases, the project is not within the Element responsible for the risk. The responsible E lement will coordinate with the appropriate project in those cases. ** Denotes a fu ture task that is not within the current budget as of the publication date of this document. 3.7 DELIVERABLES A deliverable is a customer and supplier agreed to end product(s). The supplier is the primary provider of the deliverable (s). The customer is th e primary recipient that takes ownership of the deliverable(s). A stakeholder is an entity with buy- in and interest in deliverable(s). HRP -47065 Rev B 27 Each task or progression of tasks is designed to ultimately culminate in a deliverable to the Constellation Program, th e Office of the Chief Health and Medical Officer, or the Mission Operations Directorate. Deliverables to these entities often affect mission planning or impose mission operations timelining constraints such as a new flight rule for sleep schedules or exerc ise timelines. Deliverables that impact mission planning or timelines influence the Mission Operations line shown in the blue section of the top of the Gantt charts. A deliverable from an individual task often fills a gap in some other HRP element. Part of the IRP maturation process is to identify critical dependencies for each gap. These critical dependencies will include, in some cases, information developed under another gap. The need dates for these deliverables are determined by when the other element needs the information, not by Constellation milestones. The deliverable categories are listed in the table below and briefly described in the text that follows. Category Table 3.7 Category options for Deliverables Subcategory Customer Example Require ments Vehicle/Suit Design Vehicle/Mission Development Program Suit design requirements Flight Rule/MRID/Practice Guidelines Medical or Mission Operations Sleep quality and strategy questionnaire Technology or Tool Systems Solutions/Prototype hardware Medical Operations or Vehicle Development Program Food packaging technologies In-flight blood analysis technology Computational Models Medical Operations/OCHMO or Vehicle Development Program Radiation Risk Assessment models Digital Astronaut Database HRP Database for recording HF incidents Tools/Simulations Medical Operations or Vehicle Development Program Decision support tool IMM Clinical Care/Medical Informatics Medical Operations Training for Effective Medical Operations Countermeasures Prescr iption Medical Operations/OCHMO Integrated Resistance and Aerobic Training Study Protocol Medical Operations/OCHMO Consumables tracking Prototype Hardware, Pharmaceutical, Nutritional Supplement Medical Operations/OCHMO or Vehicle Development Program Vitamin D studies Standards Update OCHMO Nutrition status assessment New OCHMO Lunar dust PEL Risk Characterization/ quantification Evidence OCHMO/HSRB NRA final report Analog Systems solution/prototype HRP ISS Bed rest facility Standard measures HRP Medical Operations/OCHMO Standardized measurement protocols HRP -47065 Rev B 28 The \"Requirements\" deliverable is chosen when a task will result in information that is relevant to a requirement (or requirements set) owned by another program (usually the Const ellation Program) or to another element. The task may end up informing the requirements on the lighting spectrum in the vehicle, or the results may apply to the radiation shielding design, or conclusions may be reached that apply to the food system from nutritional risk work. These deliverables often feed the design of the vehicle and its sub -systems. As inputs to requirements, they primarily are applied in the Systems Requirements Review timeframe . Requirements The technology or tool deliverabl e covers a broad spectrum of \"technology\" that includes hardware, processes or methods, design tools or systems simulations, databases, and computer models or simulations. These deliverables support HRP research as well as external customers. Technology or Tool A countermeasure is a specific protocol that is developed and validated to prevent or reduce the likelihood or consequence of a risk. Countermeasures may be medical, physical, or operational entities, such as pharmaceuticals, devices, or specific exercise routines, respectively. A countermeasure deliverable is usually specific and extensive enough to require validation in spaceflight. For instance, if a ground task results in a spaceflight task that is called a \"flight validation study,\" it likely is a countermeasure. Note that in some cases the countermeasure will also affect mission operations (in areas like timelines). There is no set rule for determining to which Constellation milestone a countermeasure would apply. Some general direction on this, however, is that the countermeasure usually does not affect the design of the spacecraft, and is applied in the mission operations phase as a solution to a problem; thus, the countermeasure deliverables generally affect the mission operations PDR or CDR pha ses. Countermeasure A \"Standards\" deliverable often begins as a Risk Characterization/quantification activity. Preliminary information about a risk is often incomplete. HRP would not be in a position to recommend a standard update, but preliminary information would represent a significant step toward such a recommendation. Risk Characterization tasks can feed into other tasks that also have information for standards, or they can be combined with other \"Standards\" deliverables to result in a recommendation for a new or updated standard. Standards A Standard deliverable is mandated when the program is ready to provide the OCHMO with a new standard or a recommended update to an existing health or performance standard. A key test of the Standard as a deliverable is that th e program is ready to write the text for the recommended standard update. Since the standards are applied in a broad spectrum for design and operations, these deliverables can be linked to any of the system design or mission operations milestones shown in the blue section at the top of the Gantt chart in Appendix A. They should be applied as early as possible in the design phase or mission operations development phase, so, most often, they are necessary prior to Systems Requirements Review (HRP -47065 Rev B 34). When a task results in information that must be considered by the Human Systems Risk Board , medical operations community and/or OCHMO, this deliverable is used. This deliverable is applicable when it Risk Characterization/quantification HRP -47065 Rev B 29 impacts the r ating of the likelihood or consequence of a risk. It is also applied when the results of the study are anticipated by the space medical operations community. Due to the high cost and limited access to spaceflight many experimental protocols and del iverables are developed and tested on the ground prior to validation in flight. Ground tests are often done using analogs that mimic various aspects of the spaceflight environment. HRP develops, validates, or characterizes analogs as part of its research program. Analog 3.8 REQUIRED DELIVERY MILESTONE Key milestones within the Constellation Program development drive the required date for the HRP deliverables. For instance, design requirements typically must be defined by the appropriate System Requirements Review. Design solutions and technology typically must be defined to a TRL6 level by the Preliminary Design Review. This section documents the schedule drivers for the delivery milestones. 3.9 REQUIRED PLATFORMS This section defines the platform required to perform the research. Platforms can be designated as ground analog environments, such as NEEMO, or Antarctica ; or the platform may be a space -based one, such as the Shuttle or the ISS. Also, the lunar surface is a platform that is anticipated in some research eff orts. If the ISS is required, a summary of the following resource requirements is given: number of subjects, i nitial upmass, upmass/ subject, downmass, c rew t ime per s ubject, and post-f light baseline data collection t ime. 3.10 PROJECT OR ORGANIZATION RESPONSIBLE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTIVITY Within the HRP elements, one or many projects are chosen to implement the element research plan. The project is identified in this section. In some cases, organizations outside the element, such as the NSBRI or even a n international partner , are responsible for implementation of the research . These organizations are identified within this section. This section indicates the project with primary responsibility for implementing the activity. In some cases, the project is not within the element responsible for the risk. The element responsible will coordinate with the appropriate project in those cases. Discipline teams include the participation of operations personnel, the NASA research discipline experts, and the NS BRI. In several cases, the primary responsibility is shown as that of NASA ; however, that does not mean that the NSBRI is not participating at all. The NSBRI participates through the discipline teams, as well as through future solicitations. 3.11 GRAPHIC INPUT Each graphic is supported with text that provides a more thorough level of detail. Figure 2 is an example of a Gantt chart, with each section of the chart labeled. Each Gantt chart is associated with one of the 27 PRD risks. The element to which the r isk is allocated is identified in the upper left corner. T he research gaps are identified by name and number along the left side for each risk . Under each gap are the identified activities required to fill the gap. Each activity is identified by name an d the HRP -47065 Rev B 30 abbreviation of the project or organization responsible for implementing the activity. In some cases, the organization responsible for implementing the activity may not be directly controlled by the element responsible for the risk. The schedule of each activity is shown on the graphic and an arrow shows deliverables resulting from the activity. The activities are color -coded per the legend given. A number on each text deliverable description relates the deliverable to the need date, shown by the gray numbered arrows at the top of the chart. 3.12 DECISION POINTS Several key decision points have been placed in the plan. At these key decision points, the appropriate forward path for the research will be reevaluated. The decision points are cast in a \"Yes/No\" form, and it is anticipated that at these points, the responsible element will review the overall, current state of the evidence, and review the appropriate approach to the forward plan. Where applicable, the Science Management Office will concur an d, if necessary, the appropriate Project Standing Review Panel may be convened to deliberate and make recommendations. Criteria for making the decision will be determined on a case -by-case basis and will be consistent with the overall management structure documented in the Science Management Plan. 3.13 HARDWARE DEVELOPMENT CYCLE Many HRP deliverables contribute to hardware development. A NASA hardware development proceeds through several stages, with reviews occurring between the stages. The exploration pro gram goes th rough these stages as it designs the next crew capsule, a lunar lander , and the next generation space suit . Common reviews seen in the HRP documentation are the following : \u00b7 System Requirements Review (SRR): At the beginning of the project, esta blishes what the system will and will not do. \u00b7 Preliminary Design Review (PDR): At 10% design completion, is primarily to critique the architecture of the design and critical decisions made in the design. \u00b7 Critical Design Review (CDR): At 90% design completion, is primarily to make a last set of changes before the design is finalized. To make sure that all the organizations within NASA and its associated contractors are working from the same set of plans, NASA uses a rigorous \"configuration management\" sy stem to obtain, review and implement changes to key documents. A change is initiated by a formal document called a Change Request (CR). A Change Request often solicits input from many stakeholders. That input is often provided in the form of a Review Item Discrepancy (RID). A RID is essentially a request to change part of a document and includes the rationale. The owner of the document decides whether or not to make the change. The Human Research Program often provides RIDs to CRs concerning exploration program documents. This is the NASA process that allows HRP results to change NASA 's plans for exploration vehicles .

Risk Statement This risk derives from the occurrence of environmental, social and physical conditions that may occur on a continuum. NASA BHP Ops defines an Adverse Behavioral Condition as: \"Any decre ment in mood, cognition, morale or interpersonal interaction that adversely affects operational readiness or performance.\" Scientific studies demonstrate that if left unmitigated, personal reactions such as those listed below, can erode individual motivation, morale and performance. Risk Context Worry/anxiety over conditions of mission or on Earth that distracts from mission focus Anger/resentment toward others that affects cooperation during mission Insufficient training (Pre, In or Post- Flight) Depression/lo neliness due to isolation from friends and family Unhappiness over role or treatment by others that leads to social isolation during mission Acute or chronic conditions during spaceflight may also exacerbate the risk of developing a psychiatric disorder from these adverse behavioral conditions . The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV- TR (DSM -IV-TR), defines a mental disorder as: \"A clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present distress...or disability...or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom...\" (pp.xxxi). BHP research addresses th e risk of adverse behavioral conditions and psychiatric disorders developing during or following a long duration mission. Early detection of stress or other risk factors during spaceflight is imperative to deter development of behavioral or psychiatric conditions which could seriously harm and negatively impact the individual or the crew, and pose serious consequences for accomplishing mission objectives or jeopardizing the mission altogether. Toward this end, BHP is developing methods for monitoring behavioral health during a long duration exploration mission, and adapting/refining various tools and technologies for use in the spaceflight environment. These measures and tools will be used to monitor, detect and treat early risk factors. BHP will utilize an alogs to test, further refine, and validate these measures for future m issions. BHP also develops countermeasures for maintaining behavioral health and enhancing performance during long duration isolated, confined, and highly autonomous missions; provides recommendations regarding space medicine best practices; and, provides updates for behavioral health and performance standards. Operational Relevance Assessment and Recommendations The BHP element includes two additional risks - the risk of performance errors due to fatigue resulting from sleep loss, circadian desynchronization, extended wakefulness and work overload ; and, increased errors due to poor team cohesion and performance, inadequate selection/team composition, inadequate training, and poor psychosocial adaptation. The three risks are interrelated; the occurrence or mitigation of one risk can be a contributing factor affecting another. As a result, BHP gap -related activities and deliverables may sometimes address more than one risk. HRP -47065 REV B 36 The risk mitigation strategy of the BHP Element follows the larger strategy of the HRP \"from Evidence to Deliverables \" principle, with the involvement of Medical and Mission Operations to help determine the tools and technologies that are relevant for current and future spaceflight . BHP holds an annual working group of subject matter experts who work with BHP and Medical Operations to identify gaps in knowledge and gaps in mitigation. Specific tasks are defined to address the gaps and provide clear, specific deliverables for long duration spacef light, ensuring an evidence and operationally -based end item. Working with research and operational experts, BHP systematically identifies the appropriate platform to address the gaps prior to validating in spaceflight. To ensure relevancy, stakeholders are engaged in the process from the beginning. Evidence gathered from BHP research characterize Risk, inform Operations and Standards, and yield countermeasures for performance and behavioral health. Risk Mitigation Strategy BMed1: What are the most effective methods to enhanc e behavioral health and prevent decrements before, during, and after spaceflight missions? Gaps (a) Present State of Knowledge: The goal of BMed1 is to enhance crewmember performance and to reduce the risk of an adverse behavioral state from developing during all phases of a spaceflight mission. Currently, in -mission behavioral health measures such as crew -care packages, private family conferences, email, crew- member websites, V oIP telephony, and private medical conferences, etc are preventing adverse behavioral states from developing during 6- month ISS missions. However, future missions of longer duration with prolonged isolation and confinement, increased crew autonomy, absence of synchronous communications, longer pre -mission training periods, and prolonged post -mission recovery will demand enhanced measures and increased resources (e.g., manpower) to maintain the current high levels of behavioral health associated with 6-month ISS missions. Presently, mission support pre and post mission is less well defined . (b) Desired State of Knowledge: We do not have a full understanding of the detrimental impact that spaceflight missions of one -year and longer will have on behavioral health and performance. Anecdotal evidence suggests there is a significant impact. The magnitude of this impact in -mission will be addressed in BMed Gaps 2,3,5,6 and 8, while the impacts pre and post -flight will be addressed by BMed Gaps 2 and 8. BMed Gap 1 serves to outline the most effective methods of maintaining an optimal behavioral hea lth state before, during and after missions of one to two years (or even longer in the case of a Mars mission). An optimal behavioral state is defined as one that allows the crewmember to complete required tasks with minimal minor errors, no mission impact errors, and interact with fellow crewmembers and ground support in a manner that maintains crew and crew-ground cohesion. In addition, the optimal behavioral state will allow the crew member to maintain a healthy, supportive family, or other social suppo rt unit. (c) (i) What are the U nknowns? There are several unknowns in maintaining an optimal behavioral state during extended duration missions in addition to the training and recovery period. What long term effect does sensory deprivation have on crewm embers? Anecdotal data suggests that a chronic stress state ensues which may have significant behavioral and cognitive effects. What counter - measures can be employed to prevent a chronic stress state? Can individualized crewmember HRP -47065 REV B 37 performance coaching improve the behavioral state during all phases of the mission in the crewmember as well as between crewmembers? Does stress inoculation training benefit crewmembers on long duration exploration missions? How can optimal individual and team functioning be maintained for prolonged periods. How does nutrition intake impact neurological health and cognition? Food is known to have a strong psychological impact. How does food freshness and variety impact behavioral state on long duration missions? (c) (ii) Research Approaches: BHP will conduct two in-house reviews with operations to clearly understand the behavioral elements of a successful mission and what changes may be suggested for future missions. An international data review will outline the most current eleme nts of individualized performance which will inform crewmember prescription methods for individualized performance coaching. In addition, a literature review on current methods of stress inoculation training will aid in determining whether such training may prevent a chronic stress state. An innovation study and review will define methods of sensory augmentation that could be incorporated in the spaceflight environment to combat sensory deprivation. In addition, two in -house literature reviews will aid in u nderstanding the importance of nutrition intake, as well as the impact of food variety and freshness on behavioral health. Promising tools and methods will be tested in a two-phase refinement process: first, in the JSC integrated test facility to determine operational validity and crew acceptability ; second, during actual in-flight ISS increments for final long -duration flight certification. (c) (iii) Desired Outcomes: The desired outcome of BMed Gap 1 is to develop a knowledge base and a suite of measures aimed at enhancing, monitoring and maintaining an optimal behavioral state in each crewmember during preflight training, in -flight, and during postflight recovery. Such that, the crewmember can complete required tasks with minimal minor errors, no mission impact errors, and interact with fellow crewmembers and ground support in a manner that maintains crew and crew-ground cohesion. In addition, the optimal behavioral state will allow the crew member to maintain a healthy, supportive family unit throughout all phases of flight. (d) (i) Knowledge Requirements: Several key knowledge requirements are necessary to fill BMed Gap 1. It is important to gain a better understanding of the effects of sensory deprivation on human behavior and cognition in the long dura tion environment. An understanding of how to apply stress inoculation training and performance coaching in an effort to maintain optimal crewmember behavioral states under long -term stressful conditions is required. Finally, there is a need to understand how nutrition and food variety and freshness affects cognitive and behavioral states. (d) (ii) Mitigation Level: Optimal behavioral states will gain increasing importance as mission duration increases. The risk of an operational error with a mission impact due to poor behavioral functioning on missions of one year and longer is high. Tools and methods must be in place so that no mission critical errors occur due to development of a prolonged adverse behavioral state in any crewmember. These tools must address selection, training, monitoring, countermeasures and rehabilitation phases. (d) (iii) Surveillance: To ensure that BMed Gap 1 does not incur future risk exposure, the BHP element will evaluate any changes in future spaceflight architecture e.g. durat ion, complexity, to ensure that additional risk does not develop. In addition, the element will continue to monitor new research in the behavioral health are a in an HRP -47065 REV B 38 effort to adopt improved and refined tools and methods of maintaining an optimal behavioral state in crewmembers during long duration spaceflight. (d) (iv) Transfer or Acceptance of Risk: Currently, the risk due to BMed Gap 1 is too high to transfer or accept . Development of tools and methods is required, in addition to testing and validation before a change in status may occur.

Required Platforms: ISS BMed2: What are the most effective methods to predict, detect, and assess decrements in behavioral health (which may negatively affect performance) before, during, and after spaceflight missions? (a) Present State of Knowledge: The goal of BMed Gap 2 is to develop optimal methods to predict, detect, and assess decrements in behavioral state and cognition (which may negatively affect performance) before, during, and after spaceflight missions. Crewmembers must maintain a high-level of performance while working in an operational environment under highly stressful conditions. Tight operational timelines, high workloads, dangerous work conditions, extreme isolation and confinement, and psychosocial st ressors are just a few of the demands crews face. Chronic stress adversely affects performance physiologically, cognitively, and behaviorally. Currently, crewmember performance during six-month ISS increments ha s not resulted in major behavioral health de crements. However, present prediction methods are not specific, let alone well matured and are limited to initial astronaut selection screening, and pre- mission training performance. Detection methods and tools are largely based upon self -report during cre w-member private medical conferences, or by another crewmember, and based upon the assessment of the crew psychiatrist who has 5 contact hours. Post -flight behavioral problems have occurred, but not following an ISS increment. No additional methods of dete ction are available other than a yearly psychiatric interview. A potential high yield source of behavioral information exists with the crewmember's family however, at present; this information is provided on a volitional basis. Assessment of crewmember behavioral state relies on the formal assessment of the clinical psychiatrist assigned to the crewmember for their complete flight period, and is limited to 5 contact hours. Overall, behavioral information remains difficult to obtain and document for several reasons. The prevailing view among the U.S Astronaut Corps is that behavioral performance monitoring is punitive. HRP -47065 REV B 46 (b) Desired State of Knowledge: Future exploration missions will differ significantly from the current concept of operations. The duration will vastly exceed the current six -month ISS increment and may well be one -year and longer. The distance from Earth will be ever increasing, such that the Earth will appear as a distant blue dot, or not at all. In addition, there will be a significant incr ease in crew autonomy. Does spaceflight asthenia, documented by Russian flight surgeons and space psychologists in long duration cosmonauts , represent a long duration de -adaptation syndrome? Combined with the known stressors of long duration spaceflight, the ability to predict, detect and assess behavioral decrements will be of critical importance. Selection issues will figure prominently and will be addressed by BMed Gap 6. New methods of accurately predicting, detecting and assessing crewmember behavioral state will be critical to mission success and crew cohesion. These methods should be autonomous allowing the collection of data directly from crews without overt direction from the ground. They should be non-invasive, and unobtrusive so as to allow missio n operations to continue without interruption. The tools developed should address multiple spheres of behavior and performance and will require a high degree of accuracy. Ideally, crewmember affective state, physiological stress, and cognitive performance should be targeted. These data will be transmitted to mission control. A method of integrating crewmember data over time would allow mission controllers to follow behavioral state trends throughout the mission, ideally predicting decrements before they occur, and target interventions as necessary. (c) (i) What are the Unknowns? There are several unknowns regarding the optimal methods to predict, detect, and assess decrements in behavioral health before, during, and after spaceflight missions? Several neuro -behavioral conditions have occurred in spaceflight. What is the prevalence of these conditions? What is the risk priority for each of these conditions? What role does spaceflight asthenia, observed in Russian cosmonauts; play in potential long duration behavioral decrements? Which negative behavioral states contribute to behavioral health problems and the development of major depressive disorder? Are there neural biomarkers that can be measured to detect depressive states and their severity? Do measurable physiological markers such as sympathovagal balance and sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) exist that reflect increasing behavioral stress? Behavior is typically described in terms of affective measures and cognition. What are the best measures of the affective state; emotion, stress, and fatigue, that reflect behavioral trends? Which measures of cognitive state are most sensitive to chronic stress? (c) (ii) Research Approaches: BHP will conduct two in-house reviews; one with BHP Operations to prioritize neurobehavioral conditions of concern in long duration spaceflight, the second will consist of a literature review to evaluate Russian spaceflight asthenia and its role in long duration missions. A statement of work will be issued to investigate negative stat es that contribute to behavioral health problems and depression. An SBIR will be issued to solicit tools and technologies that measure and monitor cumulative or chronic physiological stress with an emphasis on high -yield areas such as heart-rate variabilit y, sleep EEG and serum biomarkers. Currently, a statement of work is on -going examining neural biomarkers of depression non-invasively. Promising technologies measuring affective states will be investigated. Further validation of the Facial Optical Compute r Recognition platform will be conducted given its promise as an unobtrusive measure of affective state based on facial expression. In addition, an SBIR and a tech -watch will be issued to solicit technologies designed to measure affective state through acoustic voice analysis. Tools and methodologies deemed successful will receive final in -flight validation aboard ISS during a long duration increment. HRP -47065 REV B 47 (c) (iii) Desired Outcomes: The desired outcome of BMed Gap 2 is to develop tools and methodologies capable of predicting, detecting , and assessing decrements in behavioral health during all mission phases. Furthermore, multiple tools that address behavioral state from more than one domain, for example the physiological, affective, (and cognitive which will be further defined in BMed Gaps 3 and 4) will increase the sensitivity and specificity for identifying decrements in behavioral health. Measurement of these domains will occur as unobtrusively as possible to minimize mission operational impacts, and data will be down-linked to mission control and collated in a readable \"behavioral state\" tool that allows comparison and trend analysis of all measures so that accurate measures of crew behavioral state can be obtained. (d) (i) Knowledge Requirements: Several key knowledge requirements are necessary to fill BMed Gap 2. A greater understanding of the effects of the long duration environment on behavioral state is required and the negative neurobehavioral conditions that manifest as a result. It is important to clea rly identify which characteristics of the physiologic, affective and cognitive state are most affected in the long duration environment in an effort to develop accurate measurement tools. (d) (ii) Mitigation Level: Decrements in behavioral state are likel y to be magnified as mission duration increases if not identified and corrected. Such crewmember decrements if prolonged can easily spread and affect other crewmembers and crew cohesion, seriously jeopardizing mission objectives and safety. Accurate measu rement and identification such that behavioral state does not fall below the threshold for prolonged interpersonal crew conflict, crew-ground conflict, and mission-impacting operational errors is the required level of mitigation. (d) (iii) Surveillance: To ensure that BMed Gap 2 does not incur future risk exposure, the BHP element will continually evaluate new research and developments in the behavioral health area pertaining to prediction, detection, and assessment of decrements in behavioral health in an effort to adopt improved and refined tools and methods of maintaining an optimal behavioral state in crewmembers during long duration spaceflight. (d) (iv) Transfer or Acceptance of Risk: Curre ntly, the risk due to BMed Gap 2 is too h igh to transfer or accept. Development of tools and methods are required, in addition to testing and validation before a change in status may occur. HRP -47065 REV B 48 Task: (NSBRI / Strangman) NIN Depression Detection Short Title : Depression Detection (NIN) Responsible Organization: BHP Supporting Organization : NSBRI Funding Source : NSBRI Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Task Description: Spaceflight stressors, including depression, can significantly disrupt one's ability to function effectively and efficiently, an d associated performance deficits can seriously jeopardize space mission success. Mission success can be jeopardized either directly, from the potentially life -threatening consequences of lapses in performance, or indirectly, by adding to the workload and stress of other crewmembers. The substantial likelihood and potentially serious consequences of depression during spaceflight explains why human performance failure due to neurobehavioral problems is a high -priority risk for all mission types (Internationa l Space Station, moon, Mars). A variety of therapies are already available, including preventative measures, medications and psychological consultations with ground crews. However, current methods to decide whether a therapy needs to be used rely heavily on subjective self -report. The biological basis of mood disorders suggests neural biomarkers may provide a more objective method for assessing depression and associated performance deficits. This project aims to identify neural biomarkers sensitive to, and specific for, both depression detection and depression severity assessment. Since there is currently no reliable way to monitor brain status or function in spaceflight, an important component of our project will be technology development focused on the evaluation and validation of a flight -capable, noninvasive neuroimaging technology: near -infrared neuroimaging (NIN). The aims for this project therefore seek to: 1. Evaluate the ability of near -infrared neuroimaging to more objectively detect clinical depres sion and assess its severity. 2. Improve our existing mobile near- infrared neuroimaging technology to enable more robust mobile monitoring of brain hemodynamics. If successful, these aims are expected to have two primary impacts. First, identification of br ain-based biomarkers for depression will move the countermeasure readiness level (CRL) of brain -based evaluation of depression from CRL 2 to CRL 3. Once depression is objectively identified, there are already suitable depression countermeasures available for deployment in flight (including medications and psychological consults). Identification of brain - based biomarkers would be useful not only in spaceflight, but for the millions of individuals suffering from depression on Earth, by providing a more objective and potentially more readily accessible method for evaluating depression. Second, our technology development efforts have already moved the technology readiness level (TRL) of near - infrared neuroimaging to TRL 5, and we are expecting to reach TRL 6 with coming advances and studies. Our use of relatively inexpensive and unobtrusive NIN technology will enable brain imaging and monitoring not only during spaceflight, but also in a variety of Earth -based contexts including in- office neuroimaging, rural are as and even under- served communities or first -responder contexts. Deliverable(s): (Milestone) Technology or Tool _Prototype of Monitoring Hardware to BHP Predecessors/Successors to this Task: This task is a continuation of the Depression Detection effort. A decision point will follow this task to determine whether additional investigations are required. Required Delivery Milestone: Required Platforms: Ground HRP -47065 REV B 49 Task: Optical Computer Recognition of Stress, Affect and Fatigue During Performance in Spacef light Short Title : OCR Spaceflight Responsible Organization : BHP s Supporting Organization : NSBRI Funding Source : NSBRI Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Task Description : The proposed research will deliver an objective, unobtrusive, computational m odel-based tracker of the human face that validly and reliably identifies when astronauts are experiencing stress, emotion and fatigue at levels that compromise performance in space. This optical computer recognition (OCR) system will provide feedback to them for autonomous selection of countermeasures for stress, depression and fatigue. The project has four specific aims: 1. Create an OCR system capable of monitoring facial displays of specific emotions ( i.e. angry, happy and sad). 2. Improve our current OCR s ystem's ability to detect facial expressions of high versus low performance- induced stress. 3. Develop OCR algorithms to identify fatigue due to sleep loss based on slow eyelid closures (PERCLOS). 4. Test the technical feasibility of data acquisition and reliability of the advanced OCR system in spaceflight analogs that contain neurobehavioral stressors relevant to spaceflight (e.g., NEEMO). The overarching goal of the project is to further develop and validate computerized system that unobtrusively detects str ess, emotion and fatigue during space flight. We previously completed development of an optical algorithm for real -time dynamic tracking of the face using a deformable model -based tracker and Active Shape Modeling that reliably discriminates low from high stress by monitoring facial expressions. To overcome the limitations of previous optical tracking techniques, Metaxas and colleagues developed a formal framework for the integration of edge detection and optical flow into a deformable model framework and a pplied it to facial shape and motion estimation. This method used a single camera to track the shape of the face and its movement in 3 - dimensional space, and it created a deformable model, incorporating optical flow (an approximation of the motion of objec ts within a visual representation) into the model as a constraint. The knowledge gained from this task has the potential to identify an objective, unobtrusive, automated method for the recognition, monitoring and management of the risks of neurobehavioral dysfunction in affect and alertness in spaceflight and in many Earth -based safety- sensitive occupations, such as transportation workers (e.g., truck drivers, train conductors, airline pilots); operators in safety -sensitive industries (e.g., power plant co ntrol rooms); and military personnel. This optical computer recognition (OCR) system will provide feedback to astronauts for autonomous selection of countermeasures for stress, depression and fatigue. Deliverable(s): (Milestone) Technology or Tool _Protot ype Hardware to BHP Predecessors/Successors to this Task: A decision point will follow to determine whether additional investigations are required. Findings from this task will inform OCR Spaceflight Required Delivery Milestone: Required Platforms: Ground HRP -47065 REV B 50 Task: Objective Monitoring of Crew Neurobehavioral Functions (105- day Russian Chamber Study) Short Title : RCS -105 Neurobehavioral Function Responsible Organization : BHP Supporting Organization : NSBRI Funding Source : NSBRI Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Task Description: This investigation will help inform the development and validation of a Facial Monitoring Technology as a countermeasure for long duration missions. The OCR and PVT results from this simulation study will yield important d ata on alertness, stress, fatigue and negative affect throughout the 105 -day experiment. Through use of this data and further development, OCR will be designed to provide real -time feedback on the degree of stress, fatigue and negative affect it detects ov er time in spaceflight, so crews can determine when to apply countermeasures/interventions during prolonged missions. Specific Aims include : 1. Evaluate the feasibility of obtaining facial video for OCR of mood and fatigue, using cameras on the PVT computers . 2. Evaluate whether PVT SelfTest performance would covary with performance metrics from the 10 -and 20-minute PVT and the Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows. For the 105 -day Russian chamber study at the Institute for Biomedical Problems, thi s project will also deploy two objective neurobehavioral monitoring techniques, Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) and facial video for Optical Computer Recognition (OCR), as well as two mood scales, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). The optical computer recognition (computer vision) technique will be tested for its ability to unobtrusively and automatically track an individual crew member's facial expressions during spaceflight. During the 105 -Day experiment, the crew members and mission control personnel will take both the 10-minute and 3- minute PVT Self Tests twice daily from laptop computers provided to each participant. Testing will occur during periods of day and night work. The OCR and PVT results from th is simulation study will yield important data on alertness, stress, fatigue and negative affect throughout the 105 -day experiment. In addition to their utility in spaceflight, the methods used for monitoring stress and fatigue have wide applicability for use in a range of military and civilian operational environments. The testing and continued development of these technologies to identify stress - and fatigue -related problems in astronauts will facilitate timely assessment and interventions that could significantly mitigate risks related to performance deficits.

HRP -47065 REV B 54 BMed3: What aspects, if any, of cognitive performance change in- flight? If there are changes, do they persist post mission? If so, for how long? (a) Present State of Knowledge: The goal of BMed Gap 3 is to determine what aspects, if any, of cognitive performance change in -flight. If there are changes do they persist post -mission, and if so, for how long? At present t here is no evidence of cognitive changes during six-month ISS increments as assessed with the current suite of cognitive performance tools; the Space Flight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows (WinSCAT). Furthermore, no cognitive deficits have been identified post -flight. However, Russian spaceflight experience, anecdotal evidence and limited scientific data from spaceflight analogues indicate that missions of one- year and longer in an isolated and confined environment result in cognitive performance defi cits in concentration, and memory towards the end of the mission and persist for up to one -year post -mission. Investigators studying animal research have further speculated that behavioral changes in such environments may even be attributable to the effects of chro nic stress on the hippocampus which is important in declarative and visuo-spatial memory. In addition, animal studies reveal that radiation exposure can damage the subcortical basal ganglia and hippocampus, both of which are critical to cognitive functioning. There is also some limited evidence suggesting decrements in sensorimotor function and in motor behavior. (b) Desired State of Knowledge: Future missions of exploration will be much longer than the current six-month ISS increments, and may well be one -year and longer. In addition, there will be a significant increase in crew autonomy. It will be important to understand the cognitive deficits that occur, the brain structures that are most affected, and the time course of the deficits. A better understanding of the dose -response relationship of time versus deficits , in addition to radiation exposure level and degree of deficit is also needed. In both cases, it will be necessary to clearly define the physiological mechanisms that lead to the deficit in each of the affected cognitive domains, knowledge that will inform countermeasure support. The end products will include a suite of sensitive monitoring tools that accurately identify the onset of cognitive deficits and their magnitude , before the deficit becomes an operational threat (BMed Gap 4) . Correspondingly, it will be known what the most effective countermeasures are to prevent cognitive performance deficits and when they should be applied (BMed Gap 7). This line of research will also define the most effective methods of post -mission cognitive rehabilitation and recovery. (c) (i) What are the Unknowns? Several unknown factors exist. Are current tests of cognitive performance sensitive enough to identify subtle deficits in the astronaut population? Does cognitive performance decline in isolation and confinement? If so, what is the relationship between duration of exposure and degree of cognitive deficit? Are certain brain structures more vulnerable? Are multiple cognitive domains affected? If so, are some more vulnerable than others? Does chronic stress activation and elevated cortisol levels play a role in cognitive impairment? Are there other mechanisms at work? What impact does radiation exposure have on cognitive performance? Is it a globa l CNS phenomena, or are certain brain structures more susceptible? What are the underlying mechanisms? (c) (ii) Research Approaches: The BHP element recommends several research approaches to address BMed Gap 3. An in -house review will be conducted to inter view long duration mission astronauts regarding the presence of performance changes over time and their nature. In addition, a statement of work will be issued to conduct an evidence review of human cognition in long duration spaceflight. A complete unders tanding of the effects of six - month ISS increments on crew member cognitive performance will be undertaken through a directed study using fMRI pre and post -flight in addition to cognitive testing. A prospective study solicited HRP -47065 REV B 55 through a research announcement will evaluate neurostructual changes in remote duty personnel, following a one -year deployment to an Antarctic research station, using MRI and cognitive evaluations. Basic science research into the effects of various radiation levels on animal brain structures is currently ongoing and sponsored by the NSBRI. An integrated workshop will be convened partnering with SHFH, Sensorimotor and Sleep to examine concerns regarding potential cognitive performance decrements during spaceflight. (c) (iii) Desired Outcomes: There are several key outcomes in BMed Gap 3. Determine what evidence exists that cognitive performance changes occur in human spaceflight. Verify if cognitive performance changes occur in-flight during current six-month ISS missions. Substantiate w hether missions of one -year duration to isolated Antarctic research stations result in cognitive performance changes? If so, are they the result of neurostructual changes? Understand which specific brain regions are most affected. Develop an outline of the fundamental physiological underlying cognitive changes as a result of isolation and confinement. Understand the dose -response relationship regarding radiation exposure and structural brain damage. Are certain brain regions more vulnerable than others? If present, understand how long cognitive performance changes persist post -mission. (d) (i) Knowledge Requirements: Several key knowledge requirements are necessary to fill BMed Gap 3. Validate that current in -flight tests of cognitive performance are sensitive enough to uncover subtle deficits and which cognitive domains are most affected (to be addressed in BMed Gap 4)? Determine the nature and the strength of the evidence supporting Russian spaceflight asthenia and the proposed cognitive deficits. Unde rstand the evidence for cognitive deficits in analogue populations. Clearly define the effects of prolonged isolation and confinement on cognitive performance. Examine long duration populations for cognitive performance deficits and their etiology. I dentif y the precipitant causes of decrements in cognitive performance in isolation and confinement. Identify the physiological mechanisms of chronic isolation stress. Understand which cognitive domains are affected. Know the effects of various radiation levels o n brain structures and cognitive performance. (d) (ii) Mitigation Level: Decrements in cognitive performance are more likely to occur and degrade as mission duration increases if they are not identified and corrected. Crewmember cognitive performance decrements are likely to affect all members of the crew. If prolonged they could affect team performance and crew cohesion, seriously jeopardizing mission objectives and safety. Accurate determination and characterization of cognitive performance deficits in the long duration environment is critical given that the crew will be operating with greater autonomy and crew decision making will impact mission operations. Cognitive performance must not fall below the level at which mission critical operational errors would occur. (d) (iii) Surveillance: To ensure that BMed Gap 3 does not incur future risk exposure, the BHP element will evaluate any changes in spaceflight architecture e.g. duration, complexity, to ensure that additional risk of cognitive performance decline does not develop. In addition, the element will continue to monitor new research in an effort to accurately evaluate cognitive performance changes in the long duration environment. (d) (iv) Transfer or Acceptance of Risk: Curre ntly, the risk due to BMed Gap 3 is too high to transfer or accept . Characterization of the risk and its potential consequences is necessary before a change in status may occur. HRP -47065 REV B 56 Task: Detection and Prevention of Neurobehavioral Vulnerability to Space Radiat ion (NSBRI/Hienz) Short by this task: N/A Task Description: Radiation exposure is one of most dangerous risks to humans during spaceflight. Before astronauts conduct long -duration missions beyond low -Earth orbit, it is necessary to understand the biological consequences of extended stays in the space radiation environment. This study is aimed to determine the effe cts of radiation on neurobehavioral functions, such as general motor function, memory, sustained attention and reaction time. The project, which uses an animal model, is also assessing any long -term damage that radiation may cause to the central nervous sy stem. Rats were trained to perform an intradimensional/extradimensional (ID -ED) task that is a computerized analog of the Wisconsin card sort task used to test category abstraction, and is similar in function to non -automated tests of set shifting in rats that use odor, texture, or color as stimulus dimensions. Set -shifting tasks measure learning, reversal learning, preservative responding, and the ability to switch attentional sets between categories. After training, experimental rats were exposed to head -only x -ray irradiation (2.3Gy), while control rats were sham - exposed using the same anesthesia protocol. Major aims of the study include: 1. To assess the effects of space radiation across a range of cognitive/behavioral functions in rodents. Performance measures include assessments of general motor function and speed, fine motor control, inhibitory control (impulsivity), timing, short -term memory, spatial working memory, learning and selective attention, motivation, and basic sensory function. 2. To asse ss the long- term effects of radiation across a range of cognitive/behavioral functions via extended post - exposure testing for potential performance deficits. 3. To assess both the acute and long -term effects of radiation on the neurochemical mechanisms un derlying changes in cognitive/behavioral functions by examining the integrity of the neurotransmitter systems known to mediate those neurobehavioral functions found impaired. Research conducted on the effects of ionizing radiation on cognitive/behavioral function will provide the basis for extrapolating the effects of the space radiation environment on human cognitive function and performance. The Earth- based applications of this research will extend to providing a means for generalizing these effects to numerous types of radiation exposures (e.g., workplace, medical) on Earth. Thus the outcomes of these studies are expected to have an important impact on safety and the quality of life in many Earth -based applied settings, and the society at large will furt her benefit from the resulting methodological advances that effectively provide quantitative risk assessments for radiation exposure on cognitive function.

BMed4: What are the most effective methods for detecting and assessing cognitive performance durin g exploration missions? (a) Present State of Knowledge: The goal of BMed Gap 4 is to determine the optimal methods for assessing cognitive performance before, during and after flight. At present there is no clear evidence of cognitive changes during six -month ISS increments as assessed with the current suite of cognitive performance tools; the Space Flight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows (WinSCAT). In fact, no study has conclusively demonstrated a major adverse effect of long duration spaceflight on cognitive performance. Furthermore, no cognitive deficits have been identified post -flight. However, Russian spaceflight experience, anecdotal reports from astronauts, and limited scientific data from spaceflight analogues suggest that long duration missions and missions of one -year and longer to an isolated and confined environment result in cognitive performance deficits in concentration, attention and memory, and may persist for up to one -year post -mission. Investigators studying animal research have speculated that cognitive changes in such environments may be attributable to the effects of chro nic stress on the hippocampus which is important in declarative and visuo-spatial memory. In addition, animal studies reveal that radiation exposure can damage the subcortical basal ganglia and hippocampus, both of which are critical to cognitive functioning. Given that future exploration missions are expected to last up to 30 months, five times the length of a current ISS increment, the potential prolonged exposure to chronic stress and elevated radiation levels could exacerbate what are now undetectable levels of cognitive performance deficits to a degree that impacts mission operations. Cognitive performance is comprised of several elemental disciplines; sensory and motor systems, attention, memory, learning, higher cognitive functions, language, and emotion. The effects of spaceflight on each of these elements are generally poorly understood. Certainly, sensory and motor systems are key to incoming information and execution of desired responses. Certain effects such as lengthening of time perception, sensitivity to sudden head movements, motor slowing and increased motor variability have been evidenced in spaceflight. Difficulty concentrating or focusing attention has been a recurring anecdotal complaint from astronauts. Intact memory function is crucial for mission operations and multiple anecdotal spaceflight reports indicate dysfunction. Intact higher order functioning requires an assumption of intact perceptual and motor processing, attention and memory function, all of which have demonstrated at least some alteration in spaceflight. In regards to emotion, large numbers of reports indicate mood disturbance, depression, anxiety and hostility are substantial concer ns for HRP -47065 REV B 60 spaceflight and the knowledge that emotional alterations can interfere with cognitive processing. Similarly, there have been numerous reports of degradations in social functioning in isolated and confined environments. (b) Desired State of Knowledge: The desired state of knowledge is to understand the optimal methods for assessing cognitive performance before, during and after flight. It will be important to understand the contributions of each of the each of the elemental aspects of cognitive performance: sensory and motor systems, attention, memory, learning, executive and higher cognitive functions, language and emotion, and the effect that the long duration environment has on each. Furthermore, it will be important to understand the effects that chronic stress and radiation exposure has on the various brain structures responsible for these elements of cognition, and how that affects output in each element? (c) (i) What are the Unknowns? Several unknowns exist regarding optimal methods for assessin g cognitive performance before, during and after flight. With respect to the elemental aspects of cognitive functioning: What are the aspects of the sensory motor system that do not adapt completely in spaceflight? Attention is a multifaceted cognitive ability; are certain aspects of attention altered while others are not? Different processes and mechanisms exist for working memory versus long term memory, implicit versus declarative memory, and storage versus retrieval, whereas all experiments to date have focused on working memory. How are these other aspects of memory affected by the long duration environment? Is learning during spaceflight diminished given that the hippocampus and basal ganglia are key structures for learning and are prime targets for chronic stress and radiation damage? Certain aspects of executive function have not been evaluated in spaceflight such as inhibitory control, set alternation and error monitoring. What effects does the spaceflight environment have on these areas? How do emotional stimuli adversely affect cognitive processing? Finally, with respect to language, syntax and semantics have not been evaluated in spaceflight, yet in analogue populations language deficits have been described. How is language processing affected in long duration spaceflight? Does chronic stress activation and elevated cortisol levels play a role in cognitive impairment? Are there other mechanisms at work? What impact does radiation exposure have on cognitive performance? Is it a global CNS phenomena, or are certain brain structures more susceptible? What are the underlying mechanisms? (c) (ii) Research Approaches: The BHP element recommends several research approaches to address BMed Gap 4. An SBIR has been awarded to develop a prototype cognitive asse ssment tool using a gaming application that assesses the cognitive state of the crew member by combining predictive tools for assessing workload with performance decrements. If successful an extension of the SBIR will focus on validating the tool in an analogue population. A directed study will be awarded to NASA medical and psychological operations to develop a multi -person operationally relevant paradigm to document the cognitive mechanisms of team behavioral dynamics. The study will evaluate multi-player neuroimaging studies to detect group cognitive responses to individual social perturbations. Lastly, following completion of BMed Gap 3, an NRA will be released to develop additional cognitive assessment tools aimed at the various elements of cognitive processing and execution. (c) (iii) Desired Outcomes: There are several desired outcomes in BMed Gap 3. Foremost is the development of optimal tools for accurately assessing cognitive performance before, during and after flight to ensure that crew members d o not suffer cognitive impairments during training, in-flight and post -mission. The assessment tools must be capable of detecting even subtle decrements in cognitive performance so that countermeasures may be HRP -47065 REV B 61 employed prior to mission impacting decrements. A complete appreciation of how each element of cognitive processing is impacted by the long duration space environment is necessary. In addition, it will be important to understand how the responsible brain structures are affected. (d) (i) Knowledge Requirements: Several key knowledge requirements are necessary to fill BMed Gap 4 . Define the aspects of the sensory motor system that do not adapt completely in spaceflight . Determine which aspects of attention are altered in the long duration space environment. Identify the components of memory most affected by the long duration space environment. Establish the effects that chronic stress and radiation has on the hippocampus and the effects on learning and language function. Delineate the components of executive function that are most affected in the long duration space environment. Understand the relationship between the limbic system, emotional stimuli and the spaceflight environment on cognitive processing. Apply these knowledge requirements to the development of tools sensitive enough to detect subtle changes in the elements of cognitive performance. (d) (ii) Mitigation Level: Decrements in cognitive performance are more likely to occur and worsen as mission duration increases if they are not identified and corrected. Crewmember cognitive performance decrements are likely to affect all members of the crew. If prolonged they could affect team performance and crew cohesion, seriously jeopardizing mission objectives and safety. Accurate assessment of cognitiv e performance during and flight is critical given that the crew will be operating with greater autonomy and crew decision making will impact mission operations. Cognitive performance must not fall below the level at which mission critical operational error s would occur. Furthermore, impairment must not occur before flight and must be avoided post flight. (d) (iii) Surveillance: To ensure that BMed Gap 4 does not incur future risk exposure, the BHP element will continually evaluate new research and developm ents in the cognitive performance area pertaining to optimal assessment of cognitive performance in an effort to adopt improved and refined methods of performance monitoring and assessment of crewmembers during long duration spaceflight. (d) (iv) Transfer or Acceptance of Risk: Curre ntly, the risk due to BMed Gap 4 is too high to transfer or accept . Characterization of the risk and development of optimal cognitive assessment tools is necessary before a change in status may occur. Task: CogGauge: A Cognitive Assessment Tool (Phase II) Short Title: Cog Gauge Responsible Organization: BHP Supporting Organization: N/A by this task: N/A Task Description: This task is for the development of a prototype cognitive assessment tool. The Cognitive Gauge (CogGauge) tool aims to develop a portable gaming application that assesses cognitive state of astronaut HRP -47065 REV B 62 crew members with the goal of determining probable causes of observed cognitive deficits. CogGaug e, while engaging astronauts in an entertaining experience, combines predictive tools for assessing cognitive workload with metrics that assess performance decrements. CogGauge uses a hybrid approach combining predictive workload values with behavioral/per formance- based workload assessment across a number of task difficulty levels. This comprehensive approach takes into consideration learning effects across a number of cognitive tasks (i.e., mini -games in the gaming context) and derives assessment of perfor mance decrements related to cognitive deficits to identify probable causes of cognitive decrement. For Phase 2, the planned aims for CogGauge are: 1. Validation that selected game theme is suited for astronauts 2. Development of algorithms to drive dete ction and diagnosis of cognitive deficit 3. Development of suite of mini -games (working prototype; based on ANAM test battery) 4. Development of a robust \"baseline assessment\" 5. Validation that different mini -games can identify probable causes of cognitive decrement Feedback from CogGauge may be provided to astronauts and/or flight surgeons to determine impact on space flight and missions.

Based on the findings from these investigations, additional measures may be required to quantify changes of cognitive, visual, spatial, and sensorimotor functioning. This NRA will solicit efforts to identify measures sensitive and specific to the neurological changes that may be found. Deliverable(s): Risk characterization_Evidence to OCHMO/HSRB Predecessors/Successors to this Task: This task will be informed by preceding studies in Gap Bmed3 and will yield information to the HSRB upon completion. Required Delivery Milestone: Required Platforms: Ground HRP -47065 REV B 64 BMed5: What individual characteristics predict successful adaptation and performance in an isolated, confined and extreme environment, especially for long duration missions? (a) Present State of Knowledge: The goal of BMed Gap 5 is to determine individual characteristics that predict successful adaptation an d performance in isolated, confined and extreme environment s, especially during long duration missions . To date, long duration ISS crew members have largely met mission objectives. However, future missions will involve far greater crew autonomy, isolation and up to five times the current mission duration. Future missions will demand much more from the individual crewmembers and mission success will be depende nt upon crew cohesion. To date, several studies have shown that individuals who demonstrate superior performance and higher levels of coping under conditions of isolation and confinement share certain characteristics that differentiate them from those who do not. Super ior performance has consistently been linked to a personality profile characterized by a combination of high levels of positive instrumentality and expressivity along with lower levels of interpersonal aggressiveness and neuroticism. Furthermore, expressiv e traits have been found to be significantly associated with astronaut effectiveness in tasks involving teamwork and \"group living\". As a group, the U.S. Astronaut C orps has been found to have uniformly high measures of positive instrumentality, excellence in academic and job performance, and high levels of motivation prior to becoming astronauts. (b) Desired State of Knowledge: The desired state of knowledge is to understand the individual characteristics that predict successful adaptation and performance in isolated, confined and extreme environments, especially during long duration missions. It will be important to know the characteristics that enhance mission performance and success above the baseline. Furthermore, research and operations must define how each of these characteristics contributes to enhanced performance in the long duration environment. A clear understanding of the personal characteristics that predict high task ability will be needed given that a high performance level will be required in the execution of complex mission operations. A comprehensive grasp of the various factors that contribute to emotional stability as the crew will experience deprivations never before experienced in human history. Strong predictors of social compatibil ity will be needed to form crews that will remain cohesive despite social isolation and confinement for as long as 30 months. Leadership qualities will be necessary for each member of the crew as he or she will be an expert in their given professional area. Knowledge of key aspects of leadership qualities that contribute to sustained high performance and team cohesion will be most critical to mission success. A complete understanding of the individual predictors for depression and predisposing events is nee ded so that tailored countermeasures may be deployed on an as needed basis. An outline of the factors that contribute to resilience and how they benefit performance in the isolated and confined environment will also be necessary as will a better understanding of the individual predictors of anxiety based on personality type. (c) (i) What are the Unknowns? Several unknowns exist regarding the individual characteristics that predict successful adaptation an d performance in isolated, confined and extreme envi ronment s. What are the suite of characteristics that enhance performance and crew cohesion above baseline? In regards to task ability, what are the most critical components? Does age have an effect? Which are the most critical predictors of emotional stabi lity; age, work experience, education, social support, prior experience in long duration environments? What are the key factors that contribute to social compatibility in the long duration environment? Are they cultural, is it an ability to adapt, trustworthiness, emotional intelligence, facility with interpersonal conflict avoidance, other? What are the key aspects of leadership that are necessary for cohesion and performance? Is it emotional stability, motivation, social intelligence or others? How does r esilience contribute to success in the long duration environment? Where do the major contributions stem from; optimism, cognitive flexibility, problem solving ability, prior adversity? How are certain personality types HRP -47065 REV B 65 affected by anxiety? Which aspects of the long duration environment contribute most to depressive symptoms? Is a certain personality type more resistant? (c) (ii) Research Approaches: The BHP element recommends several lines of research activity to address BMed Gap 5. A statement of work has been issued for an analysis for the individual predictors of anxiety, and a white paper on depression and the most predisposing aspects of the long duration environment. A directed study literature review has been issued and recently completed on the characteristics that predict success in the isolated and confined environment. In addition, an in-house meta-analysis was recently completed examining the effects of isolated and confined environments. A statement of work, followed by a research announcement will be issued to determine the underlying mechanisms of individual differences and adaptation to the isolated and confined environment. A second statement of work will synthesize existing resilience reviews of analog populations. A third statement of work w ill evaluate previous meta-analyses on the effects of subjective well being which have identified modifiable and modulating factors. (c) (iii) Desired Outcomes: There are several desired outcomes in BMed Gap 5. Foremost is the identification of the individual characteristics that predict successful adaptation and performance in an isolated, confined and extreme environment, especially during long duration missions. A clear understanding of the individual characteristics that enhance mission performance and success above the baseline is critical. Specifically, defined characteristics that contribute to high task ability, emotional stability, social compatibility, leadership, resilience, and low risk for anxiety and depression on long duration missions will i nform: screening of astronaut applicants, select -in attributes, and key training programs aimed at enhancing these skills and traits. (d) (i) Knowledge Requirements: Several key knowledge requirements are necessary to fill BMed Gap 5. Determine the characteristics that enhance performance and crew cohesion. Identify the key aspects of task ability. Understand the predictors of emotional stability. Delineate the important aspects of social compatibility. Establish the key aspects of leadership that are necessary for cohesion and performance. Outline the essential characteristics of resilience. (d) (ii) Mitigation Level: The ability of future crews to adapt successfully and maintain a sustained high level of performance on missions of unsurpassed isolation a nd confinement will be a crucial element to their success. These missions will be more demanding than any other and will require personal characteristics that can deal with the rigors of social isolation, environmental monotony and confinement for up to 30 months. Crewmembers must be selected and trained to perform within operational limits for this length of time, and under these conditions. (d) (iii) Surveillance: To ensure that BMed Gap 5 does not incur future risk exposure, the BHP element will conti nually evaluate new research and developments identifying characteristics that predict successful adaptation and performance in an isolated, confined and extreme environments, and in particular those of long duration. HRP -47065 REV B 66 (d) (iv) Transfer or Acceptance of Risk: Curre ntly, the risk due to BMed Gap 5 is too high to transfer or accept. A more complete understanding of the risk and identification of characteristics that predict successful adaptation and performance in isolated, confined and ext reme environments is necessary before a change in status may occur. Task : The Prediction of the Onset of Anxiety Disorders Short Title: Anxiety Predictors Responsible Organization: BHP Directed Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Task Description: Anxiety is a normal human emotion that anyone would feel at times in space, as well as other settings. However, anxiety can be problematic when it is to an extent or character that interf eres with functioning in that environment. Behavioral Health and Performance (BHP) has determined a need to describe the risk to a given astronaut of developing anxiety problems on a space mission. No comprehensive assessment battery has ever been develope d to describe the probability of future onset of anxiety disorders. However, many studies have been published in the medical, psychological, and epidemiological literature that correlate anxiety with risk factors such as past life experiences, coping styles, communication styles, culture, and family history or genetics. The BHP research element will benefit from a comprehensive literature review that summarizes the findings of medical, psychological, and epidemiological literature that correlate anxiety with risk factors such as past life experiences, coping styles, communication styles, culture, genetics. BHP can use the information to update the evidence and to quantify and assess the Risk of Behavioral and Psychiatric Conditions, which is a BHP element requirement from HRP.

Behavioral Health and Performance (BHP) has determined a need to describe the risk to a HRP -47065 REV B 67 given astronaut of developing depression on a space mission. A comprehensive inventory of the literature on depression risk factors has recently been conducted for Wyle/NASA. The BHP research element will benefit from a whitepaper that synthesizes and expands on these findings, from the medical, psychological, and epidemiological literature that correlate depre ssion with risk factors such as past life experiences, coping styles, communication styles, personality, and genetics. BHP can use the information to update the evidence and to quantify and assess the Risk of Behavioral and Psychiatric Conditions, which is a BHP element requirement from HRP.

Deliverable(s): Risk Ch aracterization_ Evidence to HSRB; Standards/_ Update for BHP Predecessors/Successors to this Task: The immediate predecessor to this task will be a Research Requirement invest igation by the same name. This NRA task will be informed to some degree by each of the Research Requirements in Gap Bmed5 and, at the completion of the task, may inform Antarctic Long duration Neurostructural Change Required Delivery Milestone: TBD . This task will also yield information t o the HSRB. Required Platforms: Ground BMed6: What are the most effective methods for treating the individual to remedy behavioral health problems during spaceflight missions (including behavioral health meds)? (a) Present State of Knowledge: The goal of BMed Gap 6 is to determine the optimal methods for treating the individual to remedy behavioral health problems during spaceflight missions, including the use of behavioral health medications. To date there have been no behavioral health problems during six-month ISS increments. However, future missions will vastly exceed the current ISS duration of six months. In addition, the increased autonomy and isolation from Earth will impose a strain upon crews of historical signi ficance. Russian spaceflight experience has documented several cases of behavioral problems including depression, anxiety, interpersonal conflict and chronic insomnia requiring either intervention from ground based flight surgeons and psychologists or phar macological management. In one case a deorbit from a Salyut space station was necessary due to a behavioral problem. Long duration analogues such as the Antarctic, where personnel spend up to a year in isolation at remote research stations, have yielded a large body of experience pertaining to the development and management of behavioral health problems. Annual incidence rates of behavioral disorders ranges from 2-5%. Management of these disorders is primarily from an onsite medical officer and includes counseling, supportive measures and pharmacological treatment if necessary. In addition, since the development of telemedicine capabilities, additional support personnel such as psychologists and psychiatrists have been consulted by the medical officers for treatment advice as well as providing a portal for more advanced one-on-one therapy in the most difficult of cases. In fact, as a percentage of clinical cases, psychiatry has been documented as the leading cause for a telemedicine consultation in the United States Antarctic Program. Furthermore, many behavioral health medications have significant negative effects on cognitive performance, which would preclude HRP -47065 REV B 71 many spaceflight operations. It is understood that immunosupression is a risk with prolonged isolati on and confinement as evidenced by recent spaceflight data and analogue populations. Furthermore, a link exists between stress, mood, and immune health. (b) Desired State of Knowledge: The desired state of knowledge is to understand the optimal methods for treating the individual to remedy behavioral health problems during spaceflight missions, including the use of behavioral health medications. An understanding of autonomous, nonpharmocological treatment methods to help remedy behavioral health problems in remote crewmembers. Establish the constellation of behavioral challenges that affect crewmembers in the isolated and confined environment. Understand the role that asynchronous telemedicine would play between a mission crewmember and a mission control mental health professional in providing support and therapy, and how such a method would compare with the efficacy of real -time, face-to -face methods? Identify the best forms of supportive therapy. Define when cognitive behavioral therapy should be employed versus problem solving therapy versus social skills training and for which problem set. Define the frequency, and at which mission stage coping skills and interpersonal problem solving should be implemented. Note: early prediction, detection and assessme nt will be informed by BMed Gap 2. Define when pharmacological treatment of a developing behavioral health problem should be instituted. Establish the utility of pharmacological treatments as prophylaxis of mood decrements and potential neurostructual chan ges in long duration crewmwmbers. Understand how the immune system interacts with chronic stress and the development of mood disturbances. (c) (i) What are the Unknowns? Several unknowns exist regarding the optimal methods for treating the individual to r emedy behavioral health problems during spaceflight missions, including the use of behavioral health medications. Can autonomous nonpharmocological treatment methods help remedy behavioral health problems in remote crewmembers? What are the Constellation of behavioral challenges that affect crewmembers in the isolated and confined environment? Can asynchronous telemedicine between a mission crewmember and a mission control mental health professional provide support and therapy that approach the efficacy of real-time, face-to -face methods? Crews will be isolated for up to 30 months, what are the best forms of supportive therapy? Cognitive behavioral therapy to promote self efficacy, hope, resilience and optimism? Problem Solving Therapy for skill building and self management skills? Social skills training to reinforce psychosocial characteristics to prevent decrements in social compatibility? Coping skills and interpersonal problem solving? When is it appropriate to institute pharmacological treatment of a developing behavioral health problem? Should treatment be instituted early due to the potential impact that a debilitated crew member would have on the mission and crew? If the long duration environment does affect mood, and neurostructual changes do occur, c an certain pharmacological treatments be used in a prophylactic fashion to ameliorate and prevent these changes? How does the immune system interact with chronic stress and the development of mood disturbances? (c) (ii) Research Approaches: The BHP element recommends several research approaches to address BMed Gap 6. Firstly, optimal methods to enhance behavioral health will be informed by BMed Gap 1, while early prediction, detection and assessment of behavioral health decrements will be informed by BMed Gap 2. In addition, BMed Gap 5 will assist in providing data on selection of individuals who are more resistant to developing behavioral health problems in isolation and confinement. BMed Gap 7 will inform by outlining the necessary aspects in creating an environment conducive to preventing behavioral health decrements. Similarly, BMed Gap 8 will aid in the prevention of behavioral health problems by detailing the best methods of maintaining social support from Earth to crew members. Assessment of human factors data and behavioral issues that long current duration astronauts face will be gathered from a statement of work on analyzing the journals of ISS crew members. An NSBRI sponsored study will facilitate the development of a computer based, HRP -47065 REV B 72 self-directed , autonomous, stress and anxiety management countermeasure. A second NSBRI sponsored project will aim to develop a self guided depression treatment program resembling a computerized \"psychologist\". This program will be used by crew members to evaluate signs and symptoms of early depression and anxiety, and receive treatment as desired. It will be designed to assist ground based flight surgeons and psychologists. A research announcement will be issued to investigate the use of asynchronous telemedicine psych ological support which will be trialed in an analogue environment. In addition, a tech watch will be issued for current technologies and platforms that may exist for asynchronous video treatment of behavioral health problems. A second research announcement will be issued to determine whether prophylactic the use of a certain depression medication found to improve negative neurostructual changes in patients with depression and post traumatic stress disorder will have a similar effect on long duration crew me mbers during a one -year deployment to a remote Antarctic research station. This task will be heavily informed by BMed Gap 3 which will determine the presence of neurostructual changes as a result of depression and extended remote duty work. An integrated w orkshop will be held with BHP Team and BMed subject matter experts to provide additional input into future directions for BMed Gap 6. Finally, a third research announcement will be issued to investigate the role that chronic psychological stress has on imm unosupression. (c) (iii) Desired Outcomes: There are several desired outcomes in BMed Gap 6. Foremost is the development of optimal methods for treating the individual to remedy behavioral health problems during spaceflight missions including the use of behavioral health medications. Know the behavioral challenges that affect crewmembers in the isolated and confined environment so that selection training and countermeasures can be informed to decrease risk exposure. Be able to employ asynchronous telemedicine techniques for the effective treatment of long duration crew members suffering from behavioral health problems. Know what form of treatment therapy is best for treating given behavioral health problems in a crew member who is part of an isolated autono mous mission team. Use prophylactic medications to prevent behavioral mood problems and neurostructual changes in crewmembers over the course of a 30 month mission. Know the role that immunosuppression has on mood so as to inform countermeasures against both immunosuppresion and decrements in mood. (d) (i) Knowledge Requirements: Several key knowledge requirements are necessary to fill BMed Gap 6. Understand how autonomous, nonpharmocological treatment methods can help remedy behavioral health problems in remote crewmembers. Define the behavioral challenges that affect crewmembers in the isolated and confined environment. Establish the role that asynchronous telemedicine will play in providing psychological support and therapy to long duration crew members. Define the best forms and methods of supportive therapy for decrements in crewmember mood. Establish when pharmacological treatment of a developing behavioral health problem should be instituted. Determine the efficacy of using prophylactic medications as a countermeasure against neurostructual change. Characterize how immunosuppression may adversely impact mood. (d) (ii) Mitigation Level: The development of an untreatable, or treatment resistant behavioral health problem in a crewmember during long duration spaceflight could be catastrophic to the success of a mission. A confined and isolated crew, millions of miles from Earth, operating autonomously, with each member of the crew fulfilling a vital role cannot afford to be crippled by a chronic behaviora l health problem. Selection of crewmembers resistant to mental health decrements, trained in the most advanced team dynamic techniques, with the best monitoring methods will still require effective methods and tools to treat behavioral health problems. These tools and methods must have maximum efficacy in returning the crew member back to a state of health so as not to jeopardize mission objectives and safety. Behavioral health must not fall below the level at which mission critical operational errors woul d occur. HRP -47065 REV B 73 (d) (iii) Surveillance: To ensure that BMed Gap 6 does not incur future risk exposure, the BHP element will evaluate any changes to future spaceflight architecture e.g. duration; complexity etc to ensure that additional risk does not develop. In addition, the element will continue to monitor new research in the behavioral health are a pertaining to optimal methods for treating crewmembers to remedy behavioral health problems during spaceflight missions including the use of behavioral health medications . (d) (iv) Transfer or Acceptance of Risk: Currently, the risk due to BMed Gap 6 is too high to transfer or accept. Characterization of the risk and development of optimal methods for treating crewmembers to remedy behavioral health problems during spaceflight missions including the use of behavioral health medications is necessary before a change in status may occur. Task: Self-Guided Depression Treatment on gaps supported by this task: N/A Task Description: This task is for the completion of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to assess the effectiveness of a computerized \"psychologist\" previously under development through the NSBRI. This \"smart\" technology, developed in conjunction with NASA Flight Medical Operations, allows a crewmember on a long duration spaceflight mission to evaluate signs or symptoms of early depression and anxiety, and receive therapy as desired. The computer -based aid for addressing depression (based on problem -solving therapy), is not designed to replace the clinician; rather, it will complement the service of the aerospace psychiatrist during a long duration mission. The tool enhances privacy, confidentiality, and support of the astronaut during autonomous missions such as a Mars Mission which will have considerable communication delays between space crew and ground support. It allows the astronaut to educate him/herself, augmenting the one- on-one private physician consultation. At times when such consultation is not feasible, it will serve as a diagnostic tool and autonomous countermeasure that is available 24/7, with feedback to the individual, aer ospace psychiatrist, and the crew surgeon. Deliverable(s): Countermeasures_ Prototype Software / Medical Operations - TBD Predecessors/Successors to this Task: This task was preceded by a task with the same title which was funded from 2005 -2009. This fu ture task will be tied to Self-help stress/anxiety/affect Required Delivery Milestone: and will yield information to the HSRB. This task will be succeeded by a Transition to Medical Practice period, beginning in FY 2015, which will ultimately yield a countermeasure to treat behavioral health problems. Required Platforms: Ground HRP -47065 REV B 74 Task: A Multi -Media, Computer -Based, Self -Directed, Autonomous, Stress and Anxiety -Management by this task: N/A Task Description: This task will develop a self-directed, autonomous, interactive multimedia program to train astronauts how to recognize, assess, detect, prevent, and manage stress and anxiety on extended spaceflights. The countermeasure would be principally used in pre- flight training, with booster sessions or interventions available on orbit as needed. In this model of implementation, the skills learned prior to a mission would help to inoculate fliers to severe stress reactions thereby enhancing flight -task performance and crew health, safety and efficiency. The countermeasure will use empirically -supported stress and anxiety management strategies del ivered by interactive media in the NSBRI -supported Virtual Space Station suite of psychosocial support programs. Specif ic Aims of the study: 1. To develop a self -directed, autonomous, interactive multimedia program to train astronauts how to recognize, assess, detect, prevent, and manage stress and anxiety on extended spaceflights. The countermeasure would be principally used in pre -flight training, with booster sessions or interventions available on orbit as needed. In this model of implementation, the skills learned prior to a mission would help to inoculate fliers to severe stress reactions thereby enhancing flight -task performance and crew health, safety and efficiency. The countermeasure will use empirically -supported stress and anxiety management strategi es delivered by interactive media in the NSBRI -supported Virtual Space Station suite of psychosocial support programs. 2. To evaluate the efficacy of the program with a sample of Navy Pilots (who are similar to astronauts) in a randomized controlled trial. T he final product will be a computer -based stress management program that could be used both by flight crews and ground personnel when needed both during training and missions. At the end of this project, we will not only have developed a countermeasure with potential value to the space program, but also to the American public. Stress -related health and mental problems are among the most common and costly in the country. After this projects completion, large -scale testing in the public is needed to further identify in which sub-populations and user settings (home, clinic, etc.) it is most useful. The stress management program has the potential for widespread dissemination via broadband Internet to provide stress -management treatment to individuals worldwide.

Required Platforms: Ground HRP -47065 REV B 75 Task: Behavioral Issues Associated with Long Duration Space Missions: Review of Astronaut Journals Short Title: Journals Responsible Organization: BHP Supporting Organization: N/A this task: N/A Task Description: Aim: This project is a focused study of behavior and performance issues during expeditions to ISS. The primary aim of this study is to obtain behavioral and human factors data from a systematic analysis of astronaut journals maintained during ISS increments. Crew members will maintain personal journals for subsequent review and content analysis, which will provide a rank -ordering of behavioral issues associated with ISS missions. Behavioral Issues Associated with Isolation and Confinement: Review and Analysis of Astronaut Journals (Journals), is studying the behavioral effects of life in isolation and confinement using surveys and journals kept by the crew. By quantifying the importance of behavioral issues to long- duration crews, the study will help NASA design equipment and procedures to allow astronauts to best cope with i solation and long -duration space flight. A previous content analysis of journals maintained during long -duration expeditions on Earth (e.g., to the Antarctic) provided quantitative data on which to base a rank -ordering of behavioral issues in terms of importance. JOURNALS uses the same content evaluation techniques on journals kept by ISS crewmembers. The objective is to identify equipment, habitat, and procedural features that can help humans when adjusting to isolation and confinement while ensuring they remain effective and productive during future long -duration space flights. While on orbit, crewmembers make journal entries at least three times a week in a personal journal. In format, their journal can be either electronic (i.e., using an ISS laptop) o r paper. In addition to the journal entries, participating crewmembers complete a brief electronic questionnaire at the mid -point of their Expeditions. Studies on Earth have shown that analyzing the content of journals and diaries is an effective means of identifying issues that are most important to the person recording his or her thoughts. The method is based on the assumption that the frequency that an issue is mentioned in a journal reflects the importance of that issue or category to the writer. The t one of each entry (positive, negative, or neutral) and phase of the Expedition are also variables of interest. Study results will lead to recommendations for the design of equipment, facilities, procedures, and training to help sustain behavioral adjustmen t and performance during long- duration Expeditions on ISS, or to the moon, Mars, and beyond. These studies can also assist on Earth with Antarctic missions, service on submarines, etc., anywhere humans choose to work in confinement or isolation.

Required Delivery Milestone: Required Platforms: Ground BMed7: What are the most effective methods for modifying the environment to prevent and remedy behavioral health problems during spaceflight missions? (a) Present State of Kno wledge: The goal of BMed Gap 7 is to determine what are the optimal methods for modifying the environment to prevent and remedy behavioral health problems during spaceflight missions? To date there have been no behavioral health problems during six-month I SS increments. However, future missions will vastly exceed the current ISS duration of six months. In addition, the increased autonomy and isolation from Earth will impose a strain upon crews of historical significance. Russian spaceflight experience has d ocumented several cases of behavioral problems including depression, anxiety, interpersonal conflict and chronic insomnia requiring either intervention from ground based flight surgeons and psychologists or pharmacological management. In one case a deorbit from a Salyut space station was necessary due to a behavioral problem. Long duration analogues such as the Antarctic, where personnel spend up to a year in isolation at remote research stations, have yielded a large body of experience pertaining to the development of behavioral health problems. Annual incidence rates of behavioral disorders requiring clinical intervention range from 2-5%. The rate of subclinical behavioral health problems have been shown to be even greater. Prolonged confinement results in a restricted range, environmental monotony and sensory deprivation. Humans have evolved a sophisticated sensory apparatus, and the need to seek out novel environments which have served as a survival mechanism. For example, studies have shown that the hum an visual system releases natural opiods (morphine-like substances) when stimulated. The extent of release is directly related to the degree of scene intricacy, mystery, and quantity of natural elements such as flora and fauna. This is consistent with the \"Biophilia Theory\" advanced by the eminent Harvard ecologist Edward O. Wilson, which states that interaction with the natural world over the past 15 million years of primate evolution has inextricably linked development of the human genetic code with the s urrounding natural environment. Our urban constructs are relatively new in comparison to the vast period of primate HRP -47065 REV B 79 evolution within the natural world. Similar mechanisms are felt to underlie the auditory system and may well function for the other senses. A spacecraft like the ISS, offers no natural elements, is unchanging, and becomes \"completely known\" after a relatively short period of time providing minimal or no novelty. Moreover, due to the static, unchanging environment, the range of motor variation is also extremely restricted. The current six -month crew rotations have not led to any known behavioral health problems to date as a result of restricted range and environmental monotony and sensory deprivation. However, the limited Russian long duration experience and extensive analogue data of one -year missions has demonstrated consequential behavioral health problems. Following a one -year deployment, highly select personnel at remote Antarctic research stations have been found to have a 2% incidence of clinical depression; in addition to, increasingly disrupted sleep as mission duration increases. Thus, prolonged confinement and the extreme environmental monotony of a long duration mission of up to 30 months, five times the length of current ISS increments, are likely to result in significant behavioral health decrements and cognitive performance impairment given the current methods of modifying the conditions of isolation and confinement. Plant production has been one of the valuable methods of modifying the isolated and confined environment, providing an important link to natural Earth-bound ecosystems. Published anecdotal reports from several long duration astronauts and cosmonauts have articulated the profound positive effects that tending plant growth chambers have had on crews. Larger \"green houses\" at Antarctic research stations have also provided natural refuges and sensory stimulation to the crewmembers in isolation and confinement. The smells of various plants, higher humidity, and warmth combined with the opportunity to plant and harvest various flora create a rich sensory experience and connection to the living world. (b) Desired State of Knowledge: The desired state of knowledge is to determine what are the optimal methods for modifying the environment to prevent and remedy behavioral health problems during spaceflight missions . Restricted range, environmental monotony and sensory deprivation must be understood in terms of the effects on the five senses and the level of sensory augmentation required both directly, and via electronic media. The effects of virtual reality environments using 3-dimensional (3-D) visual, and auditory stimulation of various content including exercise in natural Earth environments both familiar and unfamiliar to the cre w member for example; a favorite jogging trail, or bicycle route, versus a novel hiking trail in the mountains of a National park, or a walk along an ocean beach. The effects of various social options included in the virtual reality environment will be und erstood and quantified, for example solo versus companion (human or favorite pet), versus group. Other more recreational options include point of view observer of sporting, musical or other arts events, and nature documentaries filmed in 3-D to give an IMA X effect. Examples of content include the BBC series \"Planet Earth.\" In contrast to personal social media, this type of content could be displayed in the common areas of the spacecraft or habitat, for example in the galley area, such that the entire crew could enjoy its benefits. Given the confines of a long duration spacecraft, various exercise options will be required to provide variety of motor movement this will include traditional exercise regimes for strength and cardiovascular fitness, but also new virtual reality technologies to augment the variety of motor movement patterns for crewmembers. For example, incorporation of virtual reality platforms that require interactive whole-body movement with audi o-visual stimulation such as the Nintendo Wii \u00a9 would provide variety and stimulation. Content examples of such platforms include a multitude of sports, in addition to fishing, hunting, and even scuba diving, thus providing a variety of virtual world s each demanding their characteristic movement patterns. Plant production has been a valuable method of providing direct sensory stimulation and a link to Earth bound ecosystems while in the isolated and confined environment. The positive behavioral effects of various types of plant production, the associated colors, aromas and textures will be defined. The amount and arrangement to induce a positive effect will also be determined. Food sources, variety and freshness are addressed in BMed Gap 4. HRP -47065 REV B 80 Finally, the positive effects of these environmental modifying coun termeasures will be monitored using new noninvasive stress analysis tools described in BMed Gap 2. (c) (i) What are the Unknowns? Several unknowns exist regarding the optimal methods for modifying the environment to prevent and remedy behavioral health problems during spaceflight missions . What degree of sensory stimulation is required to ameliorate the detrimental impacts of restricted range, environmental monotony and sensory deprivation? What are the effects of virtual reality environments using 3-D visual, and auditory stimulation? What are the measurable positive effects of onsite plant production? (c) (ii) Research Approaches: The BHP element recommends several research approaches to address BMed Gap 7. Several research approaches are required to cr eate an environment conducive to preventing behavioral health decrements. Two tasks from BMed Gap 1 will inform BMed Gap 7: \"Augmentation of Sensory Stimulation\", and \"Food Freshness and Variety. A literature review addressing the physical and environmenta l factors such as privacy, monotony, modes of communication, and plant production will direct research and technology efforts and tie-in with habitability requirements under SHFH. A virtual reality innovative project will be initiated to define the benefits and technical aspects of 3 -D audiovisual sensory augmentation during exercise using various environments. This technology will pair with onboard exercise equipment. A NASA Research Announcement will aid in the selection of hardware designed to play 3-D v ideo content for both exercise and personal use. The technology solicited will be in the form of a light weight \"head-set\" that augments the 3-D video by projecting content to the entire visual field. Included in BMed Gap 7 is the risk that microgravity, r adiation and individualized dosing have on behavioral health medications. This risk is carried by Pharmacology and Radiation. In addition, an In -House review leading to a Statement of Work, and a Techwatch with ExMC will aim to develop a behavioral medicat ions database that includes sleep medications. (c) (iii) Desired Outcomes: There are several desired outcomes in BMed Gap 7 . Foremost is the development of optimal methods for modifying the environment to prevent and remedy behavioral health problems during spaceflight missions. Define how countermeasures aimed at modifying the spacecraft/habitat environment should be deployed and regulated . Understand the degree of sensory stimulation required to ameliorate the detrimental impacts of restricted range, en vironmental monotony and sensory deprivation. Quantify the effects of virtual reality environments using 3-D visual and auditory stimulation . Understand and categorize the positive effects of onsite plant production . (d) (i) Knowledge Requirements: Several key knowledge requirements are necessary to fill BMed Gap 7 . Understand the effects of prolonged social isolation and emotional deprivation on behavioral health and cognitive performance. Measure the dose response effect of the duration of social isolati on. Determine the effective countermeasures for preventing the emotional deprivation associated with social isolation, and the frequency of use/deployment of these countermeasures as a function of mission duration and mission operational timeline. Establis h the positive behavioral effects of virtual reality environments using 3 -D visual and auditory stimulation of various content including exercise in natural Earth environments, and participation in cultural and sporting events. Measure the effects of new virtual reality technologies to augment the variety of motor movement patterns for crewmembers in isolation and confinement. For example, incorporation of virtual reality platforms such as the Nintendo Wii \u00a9 would provide variety and stimulation. Quantify and categorize the HRP -47065 REV B 81 positive behavioral effects of various types of plant production, the associated colors, aromas and textures upon personnel in prolonged isolation and confinement . (d) (ii) Mitigation Level: A future long duration human space mission to Mars will be five times longer than current ISS increments. The duration and level of isolation and confinement will be of historic proportions. The avoidance of behavioral health problems among the isolated autonomous team, and the maintenance of optim al behavioral health is of the utmost importance. The development of an untreatable, or treatment resistant behavioral health problem in a crewmember during long duration spaceflight could be catastrophic to the success of a mission. The behavioral and habitability aspects of the spacecraft/habitat environment must be optimized to maintain effective behavioral functioning. Current methods and technologies are likely insufficient to support to future long duration autonomous crews and therefore place the success of these missions in jeopardy. (d) (iii) Surveillance: To ensure that BMed Gap 7 does not incur future risk exposure, the BHP element will evaluate any changes to future spaceflight mission architecture, communications, habitability and countermeasur es to ensure that additional risk does not develop. In addition, the element will continue to monitor new research in the behavioral health area pertaining to optimal methods for modifying the environment to prevent and remedy behavioral health problems during spaceflight . (d) (iv) Transfer or Acceptance of Risk: Currently, the risk due to BMed Gap 7 is too high to transfer or accept. Characterization of the risk and development of optimal methods for modifying the environment to prevent and remedy behavioral health problems during spaceflight is necessary before a change in status may occur.

Required Delivery Milestone: Required Platforms: Ground Tasks in Gap BMed7 also inform tasks in Gap BMed2 BMed8: How do family, friends, and colleagues affect astronauts ' behavioral health and performance before, during, and after spaceflight? (a) Present State of Knowledge: The goal of BMed Gap 8 is to determine the effect that family, friends, and colleagues have on astronauts' careers before, during, and after spaceflight? A long duration flight to Mars is a unique experience given that whatever the circumstances, once the crew has left Earth they will not return until the completion of the mission , up to 30 months later. Two of the most significant challenges in long duration spaceflight and analogue environments are isolation and confinement. Isolation has a strong social context in that the crewmember is restricted to interacting with a limited number of people. In the case of an ISS increment, or a future Mars mission as currently proposed, only 5 other individuals. Moreover, the crewmember may have already spent several years training with their crewmates. Human beings are a highly social species which has conferred an evolutionary survival advantage for millions of years. The extreme social restriction of the spaceflight environment is an abnormal condition for humans. Although crewmembers have demonstrated an ability t o complete six -month ISS increments, future missions of 30 months with limited communications may manifest behavioral health problems. Recent scientific literature is revealing the biological effects of social isolation and consequent emotional deprivation. Health problems are known to be more prevalent, and life -expectancy shorter in persons with limited social contacts. Conversely, frequent social contact, physical touch, and even voice contact only, with relatives and close friends has been shown to have a positive effect on health and longevity though the release of the hormone oxytocin, a natural anxiolytic, decreased sympathetic tone of the autonomic nervous system, and decreased release of cortisol. HRP -47065 REV B 85 (b) Desired State of Knowledge: A clear understand ing of the effects of prolonged social isolation and emotional deprivation on behavioral health and cognitive performance must be established. The dose response effect of the duration of social isolation will be understood. Effective countermeasures for preventing the emotional deprivation associated with social isolation will be identified, and their deployment will be staged and regulated depending on mission duration and periods of higher mission stress; for example, during a Mars landing and departure , or during periods of greater loneliness on the return journey. A clear appreciation for the positive behavioral effects of various forms of asynchronous communication such as voice, text message/email, digital images, and 3 -dimensional video messaging from family and other Earth bound social contacts will be defined. Furthermore, the degree of positive emotional impact of various social contacts will be identified. For example, what is the emotional impact of a primary family member, a close friend, a coworker, a famous personality, school group, or a favorite pet? The frequency and variety of social contact required to maintain optimal behavioral health will also be known. Furthermore, the emotional impact of regular reminders of Earth-bound social ties in the form of a digital library that is regularly broadcast in an electronic picture frame in a crewmember's personal quarters will be characterized. The impact of a crewmember video library of important social events that can be randomly accessed will also be established. (c) (i) What are the Unknowns? Several unknowns exist regarding the effect that family, friends, and colleagues have on astronauts' careers before, during, and after spaceflight. Premission Phase: During the premission phase what type of discussion must occur between loved ones occur before a crew member commits to such a historic mission? Selection as a crewmember on such a historic long duration space mission is a decision potential crewmembers should ensure they consider fully and in consultation with the significant people in their life taking into account the important issues it raises. Do crewmembers and their families require counseling to determine if such a decision is right for them? What assistance does the family relationship require to withstand such a period of separation? If doubt exists does counseling assist in reaching the right decision? Some of those questions may include: Will the immediate family be able to cope with the current obligations, work or personal situations that they may face and how will any additional burden affect them? Are children dependant and how will the crewmember's partner manage family responsibilities without them at home? Are there elderly family members who are dependent upon the crewmember or their family, who are ill or likely to die during the mission ? How will the crewmember be affected by living without the physical contact of family and friends? Are there small children among the crewmember's family? Could such a separation have detrimen tal effects upon them? Children do worry, and it is expected that they will be upset about a parent's absence or worried about their parent being in danger on a long duration space mission. Crew members and family must consider the role changes that will occur during the crewmembers prolonged absence. Mission Phase: The realization that the separation will occur for several years will set in, and a feeling of sadness and emptiness may follow. How will this affect the crewmember and their family? The imminent departure may produce tension, sadness, anxiety , annoyance and even resentment. It is a time when family and HRP -47065 REV B 86 friends may begin to detach themselves emotionally from the crewmember. What support systems will be necessary for the family? Regular communications between crewmembers and their loved ones will be essential to reaffirm the caring and sharing between them. Even if physically separated, the knowledge that they care for one another will be comforting and reassuring. A lack of communication betw een a crewmember and their family and friends throughout the mission will cause difficulties for the crewmember, both during the mission, and when he or she returns home. Post Mission Phase : A crewmember and their family and friends will face the crewmember's return to Earth with excitement and apprehension after 30 months of separation. What will be the best methods of dealing with the acceptance of changes that have occurred in both the crewmember and the family and friends to help re- establish the bond between the crewmember and family/friend unit? Each will have had their own experiences and memories during the period of separation. Family members may have adopted new interests, met new people, and formed new friendships. What will be the best methods for crewmembers to re-establish their connections to family and friends? How will roles and tasks be re-allocated upon the crewmember's return to Earth ? After a 30 month mission to Mars, living in an isolated and confined environment, the return to Ear th may be unsettling for the crewmember. Studies of soldiers who were either missing in action or prisoners of war, have found that when families were reunited after the forced separation, conflicts and problems not resolved prior to the separation tended to arise again at the reunion, and expectations had changed. Children will have grown and learned to function without the daily presence of the returning crewmember. What will be the best methods of reintegrating the crewmember? Will the crewmember find the noise, people, crowds and overall sensory stimulation too much to cope with thereby suffering an adjustment reaction, depression or even worse, post traumatic stress? Will family members be disappointed by a crewmembers' 'unsociable' behavior after 30 mo nths of isolation and confinement? (Which is known to occur in people exposed to long periods of isolation and confinement.) How will the crewmember be reintegrated into the routine of living back on Earth? What are the effects of prolonged social isolation and emotional deprivation on behavioral health and cognitive performance? Is there a dose response effect regarding the duration of social isolation and emotional deprivation? What are the most effective countermeasures for preventing emotional deprivation associated with social isolation? What are the positive behavioral effects of various forms of asynchronous communication (store and forward) such as voice, text message/email, digital images, and 3-dimensional video messaging from family and other E arth bound social contacts? How should these countermeasures be deployed and regulated? Does the degree of positive emotional impact of social contact depend upon the nature of the social contact e.g. a primary family member, versus a close friend? (c) (ii) Research Approaches: The BHP element recommends several research approaches to address BMed Gap 8. Several research approaches are required to determine the effect that family, friends, and colleagues have on astronauts' careers before, during, and after spaceflight. An in -house review will identify current behavioral health support operations , and changes that may be needed to continue to support the astronauts and their families, friends, and colleagues during a 30 month mission to Mars. A statement of work will evaluate the evidence surrounding the biological basis of emotional support. An in-house literature review and combined BMed and Team workshop will evaluate the most effective modes of communication between long duration crewmembers and their family, friends, and colleagues in providing emotional support during spaceflight (e.g., email, voicemail, asynchronous video message). This will also have a tie to Team HRP -47065 REV B 87 Gaps. A third statement of work will characterize the best methods and tools to maintain contact with astronaut social support network during pre -mission training. The final statement of work will determine best protocols for reintegration for their personal support network after spaceflight missions. (c) (iii) Desired Outcomes: There are several desired outcomes in BMed Gap 8. Foremost is to determine the effect that family, friends, and colleagues have on astronauts' careers before, during, and after spaceflight . Understand the effects of prolonged social isolation and emotional deprivation on behavioral health and cognitive performance. Determine if a dose response effect exists regarding the duration of social isolation and emotional deprivation. Delineate the most effective countermeasures for preventing emotional deprivation associated with social isolation . Measure the positive behavioral effects of various forms of asynchronous communication (store and forward) such as voice, text message/email, digital images, and 3 -dimensional video messaging from family and other Earth bound socia l contacts . Establish the degree of positive emotional impact on crewmembers of various social contact s e.g. a primary family member, versus a close friend . (d) (i) Knowledge Requirements: Several key knowledge requirements are necessary to fill BMed Gap 8. Understand the effects of prolonged social isolation and emotional deprivation on behavioral health and cognitive performance. Measure the dose response effect of the duration of social isolation . Determine the effective countermeasures for preventing the emotional deprivation associated with social isolation, and the frequency of use/deployment of these countermeasures as a function of mission duration and mission operational timeline. Characterize the measurable positive behavioral effects of various forms of asynchronous communication such as voice, text message/email, digital images, and 3 -dimensional video messaging from family and other Earth bound social contacts . Establish the degree of positive emotional impact of various social contacts; f or example, a primary family member, versus a close friend or coworker . Quantify t he frequency and variety of social contact required to maintain optimal behavioral health , in addition to the mode of contact: email, voice, still image, and video. (d) (ii) Mitigation Level: A future long duration human space mission to Mars will be five times longer than current ISS increments. The duration and level of isolation and confinement will be of historic proportions. T he effect that family, friends, and colleagues have on astronauts' careers before, during, and after spaceflight will be critical. The development of an untreatable, or treatment resistant behavioral health problem in a crewmember during long duration spaceflight could be catastrophic to the success of a mission. The negative impact of separation from a crewmember's family and friends must be minimized. Current methods and technologies are likely insufficient to support to future long duration autonomous crews and therefore place the success of these missions in jeopardy. (d) (iii) Surveillance: To ensure that BMed Gap 8 does not incur future risk exposure, the BHP element will evaluate any changes to future spaceflight mission architecture, communications, habitability and countermeasures to ensure that additional risk does not develop. In addition, the element will continue to monitor new research in the behavioral health area pertaining to optimal methods for maintaining contact with family and during spaceflight and through an astronaut's career. HRP -47065 REV B 88 (d) (iv) Transfer or Acceptance of Risk: Currently, the risk due to BMed Gap 8 is too high to transfer or accept. Characterization of the risk and development of optimal methods for modifying the environment to prevent and remedy behavioral health problems during spaceflight is necessary before a change in status may occur.

Risk Statement Human performance decrements may occur due to problems associated with working in the space environment and to the failure of the crews to cooperate and work effectively with each oth er and/or with flight controllers and other support staff. Interpersonal conflict, impaired communication and inadequate teamwork behavior will impact performance and mission success. The history of spaceflight crews regarding important team dynamics including communication, cooperation, and coordination has not been systematically documented. Tools, training and support methods should be provided to reduce the likelihood of this risk so that optimal crew performance may be realized for exploration missi ons. Current ISS mission operations for six month durations are sufficient, however there are ways to improve and optimize current operations regarding teamwork. In addition, lunar missions, while planned for six month durations, will benefit from research addressing monitoring and methods for self regulating teams living and working in isolated, confined environments. Risk Context While little empirical data have been collected regarding the impact of interpersonal and intrapersonal factors on spaceflight performance, it is possible that crew conflict could jeopardize long duration Exploration Missions. Reports from MIR reveal that several missions may have been terminated earlier than planned due to interpersonal frictions between crewmembers, and some veteran NASA astronauts have reported crew conflict during previous space travels. Understanding the potential negative impacts of interpersonal and intrapersonal issues from spaceflight and relevant, high fidelity analog environments is critical for identifying actions required to help crewmembers succeed during new types of missions (e.g., Mars Missions). Few individuals have spent one year or longer in isolated and confined environments, and a Mars Mission could be as long as three years in duration. Thus, observations and \"lessons learned\" from previous space missions and from relevant analog environments are important sources of information required to inform these efforts. In preparation for Exploration Missions, BHP research focuses on preventing and mitigating the Risk of Performance Decrement due to Inadequate Cooperation, Coordination, Communication, and Psychosocial Adaptation within a Team. Primary mitigation strategies include the development of: m onitorin g tools and technologies, countermeasures, training requirements , and selection/composition recommendations. These mitigation strategies are needed to aid flight crews and ground support teams so that optimal performance for the team may be realized. Operational Relevance Assessment and Recommendations The risk mitigation strategy of the BHP Element follows the larger strategy of the HRP \"from Evidence to Products\" principle, while being driven by Operations. BHP holds an annual working group of subject matter experts who work with B HP and Medical Operations to identify gaps in knowledge and gaps in mitigation. Specific tasks are defined to address the gaps and provide clear, specific deliverables, Strategy for Mitigation HRP -47065 REV B 100 ensuring an evidence - and operationally-based end item. Working with research and oper ational experts as well as utilizing the BHP Analog Assessment Tool, BHP systematically identifies the appropriate analog to address the gaps prior to validating in spaceflight. To ensure relevancy, stakeholders are engaged in the process at the beginning. Findings from BHP research inform operations and standards as well as update the evidence base for the BHP Risks. The strategy for mitigation for this area of research is to develop an empirical -based approach to first identify the most relevant and serious threats to task performance, teamwork, and psycho -social performance within the team context. Utilizing a common set of criteria will allow for the systematic review and analysis of knowledge as well as current practices/policies in implementing BHP operations. Once these threats have been identified, the most effective ways to monitor and measure these threats as well as the identification of optimal countermeasures to mitigate these threats will be determined. To further mitigate the risk, specific factors have been identified (e.g., crew composition, communication, autonomy, etc.) as highly relevant to long duration space missions. Thus, these gaps will focus specifically on understanding the true impact of these factors on long duration missio ns. BHP Gap Team1: Given the context of long duration missions, what are the most likely and serious threats to task performance, teamwork, and psycho -social performance? This gap represents a knowledge gap within the Team Risk. Specifically, this gap includes areas of understanding related to team interaction, teamwork, etc. that remain and/or are unknown at this point in time. This gap serves to characterize the Team Risk, and in many instances, provides the basis of risk mitigation strategies (e.g., R equirements and/or Standards) that will be defined from future research that would be carried out in other gaps within the Team Risk from these initial efforts. The desired state of knowledge includes an expert level of understanding regarding how teams interact and perform over a long duration mission. As such, it is imperative that this knowledge gap include tasks that will seek out information from ground studies utilizing high fidelity space environment analogs, when possible. Three main team outcomes will be examined for tasks that reside within this gap; they include task performance, teamwork, and psychosocial performance. Many of the tasks included in this gap currently consist of literature reviews and operational assessments, serving as Risk Characterization Deliverables. As many serious and relevant threats to these important team outcomes have not been systematically analyzed and documented, this gap will continue to include tasks, as necessary, that take an empirically based approach to ide ntify which threats are most relevant and serious to the set criteria. When the most important and significant threats to team interactions and their performance have been fully identified, understood, and researched, it will be appropriate to close this k nowledge gap, and instead, include periodic literature reviews in the specific gap that relates to the optimal mitigation strategy that was identified (e.g., Team Gap 5 would include an annual review of current training practices that are relevant to spaceflight).

These data are necessary to address certain BHP gaps. Thus, BHP research proposes to include measures for objectively assessing performance in spaceflight. In addition to personality and behavioral performance data, BHP also needs astronaut job and mission performance data in order to determine and rank the most salient personality characteristics and behaviors of the h ighest performing astronauts. In order to address this need, this task includes an operational assessment of existing performance data that exists and is available and usable to the BHP research element. Future research studies designed to specifically obtain performance data will be influenced by the conclusions of this effort. Aims: 1.

Research within the team area has consistently demonstrated that, given a context similar to that of a long duration mission, these factors may negatively impact these important team outcomes if not addressed. Currently, a formal set of measures and tools identified for monitoring and ass essing these important team outcomes within the astronaut population in long duration spaceflight does not exist. It is therefore essential to conduct research that will identify the most optimal measures and tools to monitor and assess those risk factors and their impact on crew performance, cohesion, and crew -ground interaction. In order to demonstrate their generalizability to the astronaut population, these measures should be validated within an analog environment. Utilizing high fidelity analog enviro nments provide support for the justification of using such measures in a space context as they provide a realistic setting of long duration missions. Part of the validation process of the selected measures includes creating a normative database so that quantitative analyses may be conducted to determine the generalizability and utility of team measures for the astronaut population and to identify those measures most suitable for spaceflight. To date, few if any team measures or monitoring tools of the thre e criteria described above have not been examined within the context of an analog environment, nor have many factors relating to these team outcomes been observed. Furthermore, no team measures or tools have been validated for long duration mission purpos es and no normative database of team measures exists; the verifiability of any team measures or monitoring tools, therefore, cannot be confirmed at this time. Thus, this proposal seeks to test a set of standardized measures for team gaps and a normative da tabase of team measures that are generalizable to both the astronaut population and the spaceflight context by utilizing high fidelity analog environments. This study will provide the opportunity to assess crew performance, crew cohesion, and crew -ground interaction and identify which risk factors are most influential in relation to those three outcomes. In addition, it will also enrich the team literature and knowledge base of team research within the analog environment. Aims: 1) Determine optimal way s through which to assess and monitor important team outcomes and factors relating to those outcomes 2) Develop an ongoing normative database that will aid in the determination of the most optimal measures and monitoring tools of crew performance, crew cohesion, and crew -ground interaction 3) Combine optimal team measures to form a standardized set of team measures to be utilized across analog research Predecessors/Successors to this Task: 1.

Required Platforms : Ground Studies Task Title: Examination of Behavioral Health and Performance: ISS Proposal Short Title : ISS Proposal Responsible Organization : BHP Supporting Organization : N/A Funding Source : Directed (In-House) Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Task Description: Although behavioral health research has been well documented and identifies strong relationships among factors within the general population, the vast majority of this research is cond ucted using terrestrial samples. Little to no quantitative data accessible to the BHP Research Element exists that is specifically related to BHP issues utilizing an astronaut population in a space environment. Indeed, a recent effort to systematically assess the existence, accessibility, and feasibility of performance and/or other behavioral health -related data that is collected or already exists within the operational environment is currently being conducted by both BHP Operations and Research team membe rs; to date, little quantitative data has been identified and further, this data has been determined inaccessible due to confidentiality issues. However, although this data is not currently collected and accessible to BHP Research, the need seems to be clear when considering the anecdotal reports described above and current context of ISS. Specifically, there may be factors that trigger BHP issues, particularly when considering cultural diversity, increase in crew members, and team interactions and dynami cs. In order to obtain qualitative and quantitative BHP -related astronaut data, drive our research initiatives for present and future missions, and inform an NRA call for an ISS study, it is essential to have documentation of experiences aboard ISS missions. Aims: The main objectives of this study are twofold. 1. This study will be conducted for documentation purposes to systematically collect data specifically related to behavioral health and performance in the astronaut population. Methodologically sou nd data collection efforts (e.g., validated scales, longitudinal design, and multi -level data structure) will enable BHP to determine base rates of behavioral health- related issues within this select population at both the individual and team level. 2. By quantitatively identifying factors that are salient to defining behavioral health and well -being in the astronaut population, this study aims to provide direction to BHP research in regards to future operational research studies that are necessary and wil l help reduce risk within this element as well as inform current operations. This includes informing an NRA call for an ISS study in 201 1. HRP -47065 REV B 105 # of Subjects (kg/subject) Downmass 1.5 hours Predecessors/Successors to this Task: 1.

Required Platforms : ISS Task Title: BHP ISS Utilization Study Short Title : BHP ISS Utilization Study Responsible Organization : BHP Supporting Organization : N/A Funding Source: Solicited - NRA Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Task Description: When considering long duration scenarios, it is acknowledged that there are many factors likely to influence individual and crew adaptation, well -being, and performance as well as crew cohesion and the interactions between crew and ground control. To understand the factors that influence the above mentioned outcomes, it is essential to have documentation of experiences aboard ISS to provide insight to experiences related to behavioral health an d performance in the spaceflight environment. ISS provides an ideal testbed as it has been found to have higher fidelity to long duration spaceflight than other analogs (Keeton, Leveton, & Shea, 2009). Using ISS to assess behavioral health and performance- related issues is especially important when considering the impact of increased cultural diversity as well as a higher number of crew members aboard the ISS at one time . The results of this study will provide documentation of behavioral health and performa nce related issues in the astronaut population that may be used to inform current operations, determine base rates of behavioral health -related issues in this population and most importantly, drive BPH present and future research initiatives based on quant itative and evidence -based data. Aims: 1. This study will be conducted for documentation purposes to systematically collect data specifically related to behavioral health and performance in the astronaut population. Methodologically sound data collection efforts (e.g., validated scales, longitudinal design, and multi -level data structure) will enable BHP to determine base rates of behavioral health- related issues within this select population at both the individual and team level. 2. By quantitatively ide ntifying factors that are salient to defining behavioral health and well -being in the astronaut population, this study aims to provide direction to BHP research in regards to future operational research studies that are necessary and will help reduce risk within this element as well as inform current operations.

From the list of the projects being funded, it does not appear that NASA is making full use of the wide and deep pool of the potentially available expertise\". In order to ad dress this request and fulfill this need, we plan to hold an integrated workshop inviting subject matter experts beyond our current scope of researchers to help inform research within the BMed and Team Risk (will discuss current and future research tasks and get input from SMEs that attend). As SRP recommended, it is important to expand the current expertise that exists within other areas of industry and government that are relevant to both the BMed and Team Risks. This targeted workshop will seek to increase the number of experts that can provide valuable input and insight as to the future directions of research within these Risks. At the completion of this task, a decision point will follow to determine what specific future research tasks must be addres sed within each Risk based on the recommendation outcomes from the conclusion of the workshop. Aims: 1. Increase the number of experts within the scientific community that is providing their expertise and input toward the definition of the Team and BMed Risk. 2.

This is mentioned for gap Sleep 3, but is equally relevant to many other tasks and [Risks]. Thus, in order to i dentify the relevance to pre and post mission aspects to the Team Risk, we agree to first conduct a literature review in relation to the psychosocial adaptation pre, during, and post mission. Thus, the purpose of this literature review is to examine the i mportance and impact of psychosocial adaptation during different phases of a spaceflight mission as relevant to the Team Risk. Specifically, the review will be focusing on the change in adaptation across the mission, as suggested by the Standing Review Panel.

Final Report submitted to BHP -Research Required Platforms : N/A HRP -47065 REV B 109 BHP Gap Team2: Given the context of long duration missions, what are the best tools to effectively monitor and measure task performance, teamwork , and psycho -social performance? This gap represents a mitigation gap within the Team Risk. Specifically, this gap 's approach is to identify optimal ways to monitor and detect changes in task performance, teamwork, and psycho-social performance. However, some of the tasks that are included in this gap also serve as countermeasure development; so in some instances, we see a final product that serves as a monitoring tool deliverable as well as a countermeasure deliverable. This gap serves to provide insight as to how team interaction and the team dynamic itself changes over time, especially when considering the context of a long duration mission. The desired state of knowledge includes an expert level of understanding regarding how teams interact and perfo rm over a long duration mission and furthermore, the ability to assess and track these changes in a spaceflight environment. Thus, it is very important that the tools that are developed are tested in both ground and spaceflight studies for validation purposes. As with the first gap, there are three main team outcomes that are examined for tasks that reside within this gap; they include task performance, teamwork, and psychosocial performance. Currently, many tasks within this gap consist of cohesion-type tools that will provide insight of how the team is functioning both from a task perspective as well as interpersonally. However, a current assessment of other relevant monitoring technologies is revealing that there may be other aspects of the team dynamic that can provide valuable insight if monitored. When the ability to monitor the team in an obtrusive manner, and yet still provide valuable team -related information (including performance metrics) have been developed, validated, and tested on ISS, it will be appropriate to close this mitigation gap. HRP -47065 REV B 110 Task Title: Automated Behavior and Cohesion Assessment Tools Short Title: Automated Assessment (Cohesion) Responsible Organization : BHP Supporting Organization : N/A Funding Source : Solicited - SBIR (Cybern et)** Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Task Description: The long- term goal of the proposed effort is to develop a set of applied technologies that we call the Automated Behavior and Cohesion Assessment Tools (ABCAT) system that can monitor crew c ohesiveness and productivity in an unobtrusive manner and identify potential abnormalities for feedback to astronauts and flight surgeons for further investigation. The ABCAT system will include both the ability to model and recognize these states as well as the ability to help reconcile these states without distracting the crew. Aims: The overall goal of this effort is to create a set of sensors systems and processing and analysis modules that collectively produce the information that allows flight surgeo ns to assess the morale of crew and their team cohesion and productivity. To do this we have the three primary technical objectives: 1. Implement the ABCAT prototype system. We will revise our Phase I design based on early Phase II feedback from the sponsor and instantiate the end -to-end functionality of data acquisition, three stage processing, and finally presentation of the end results to an end -user (such as NASA Flight Surgeons) 2. Develop well -founded models for crew task performance, social interacti ons, and individual mental state. The Cybernet team 's expert in team cohesion, performance, and cognitive modeling will perform an early Phase II in- depth analysis of the modeling requirements in order to establish the ABCAT intermediate and final models t hat provide the most informative and reliable information to end users. Iterative modification to the model will occur as issues and revelations are encountered. 3. Test and evaluate the system 's ability to derive clear, objective measures from the suite o f sensors and processing modules. Once the prototype ABCAT system has been implemented, we will field a set of sensors and gather and process the capture data for a long enough period of time that permits reasonable analysis of the results. We will internally review these results, identify changes that are required to mitigate issues or improve performance, and modify the ABCAT system 's design and processing accordingly. Once results are at a sufficiently high performance level, we will present the data and results to NASA flight surgeons for review and feedback and revise the system 's design and processing to address their comments.

A variety of adverse influences may negatively impact the performance of mission teams both on the ground and in flight. Such influences may include physical stressors on the organism such as diurnal disruption as well as psychological factors such as interpersonal conflict among team members. Given the importance of team effectiveness, NASA - BHP has identified a need to monitor the functioning of teams, primarily using unobtrusive means. Monitoring can serve several operational goals: 1. Monitoring during personnel selection activities can provide valuable input for the selection of compatible team members and of individuals with psychological profiles suited to teamwork in extreme environments and situations. 2. Monitoring during training activities can provide diagnostic information useful in guiding further instruction and coaching as well as in determining the composition of teams prior to mission deployment. 3. Monitoring during missions can provide forewarning of potential operational failures due to disruptions of team functioning and give the opportunity to take preventative measures. As such, in order to identify optimal monitoring tools and technologies that are unobtrusive and valid, it is critical to identify what type of tools could be adapted for the spaceflight context that would be most beneficial and effective. Thus, a review of monitoring tool and technology research will help steer future training efforts in preparation for exploration missions. Aims: 1. Complete a literature review and conducting an operational assessment of current monitoring tools and technologies that are relevant to the Team Risk (specifically focusing on monitoring task performance, psychosocial performance, and teamwork). 2.

Countermeasure development can span pre -during-post mission phases, some of the current tasks address these different phases of a long duration mission. This gap serves to provide the countermeasures that are needed to best support the team in terms of their technical task performance as well as their social interactions (while addressing their psycho -social needs). The desired state of knowledge includes a suite of tools that span the mission phases (pre, during, and post) that crews can use to support their team functioning for a long duration mission and furthermore, enhance both their performance and well -being. Thus, similar to Team Gap2, it is very important that the tools that are developed are tested in both ground and spaceflight studies for validation purposes. As with the first two gaps, there are three main team outcomes that are examined for tasks that reside within this gap; they include task performance, teamwork, and psychosocial performance. Currently, few tasks are active in this gap. Future tasks are slated to focus on virtual reality development, uti lizing and efficient and cost -effective approach to provide the support that will be needed for crewmembers on long duration missions. When the ability to provide the support needed for the crew across the mission phases (pre, during, and post) through tools that are well-developed and validated, in addition to being unobtrusive, cost -efficient, and effective (i.e., has positive impact on team performance and/or team interactions), it will be appropriate to close this mitigation gap. Task Title: Literature Review and Operational Assessment of Countermeasures Related to BHP Short Title: Countermeasure Review Responsible Organization : BHP Supporting Organization : N/A Funding Source : Directed - SOW (Morie) Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Task Descri ption: In the context of spaceflight, teamwork is an essential ingredient in successful missions. There are many issues within the context of a long duration that may adversely impact the teamwork within the crew and the individuals themselves. Given the importance of high performance and team effectiveness, it is necessary to identify specific countermeasures that may help support the crewmembers and alleviate issues that may cause conflict or tension with the team. As such, in order to identify optimal countermeasures that are effective and help mitigate risk related to the team dynamic, it is critical to identify what type of countermeasures could be adapted for the spaceflight context that would be most beneficial and effective. Thus, a review of cou ntermeasure research will help steer future training efforts in preparation for exploration missions. Aims: 1. Complete a literature review and conducting an operational assessment of current countermeasures that are relevant to the Team Risk (specifically focusing on monitoring task performance, psychosocial performance, and teamwork) including those countermeasures related to virtual reality. 2. Report interim findings at the completion of each of the project components. 3. Create a final report which w ill be presented to the BHP Research Element that summarizes findings.

Required Pl atforms : N/A Task Title: Countermeasure for Managing Interpersonal Conflicts in Space: A Continuation Study Short Title: Self Help Conflict Management Responsible Organization : BHP Supporting Organization : N/A Funding Source : NSBRI (Cartreine ) Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Task Description: Some amount of interpersonal conflict is expected on long -duration missions, whether between crew members or between the crew and the ground. However, severe conflicts can interfere with mission success and even safety. Severe, ongoing conflicts have been reported on long -duration space missions, Antarctic expeditions and a recent long-duration space mission simulation. Nonetheless, empirically -supported tools to help crews prevent, assess and manage int erpersonal conflicts have not been developed. This study addresses Bioastronautics Roadmap Risk 24: Human Performance Failure Due to Poor Psychosocial Adaptation. The investigators have begun development of an interactive multimedia portal to help long -duration flyers prevent, detect, assess and manage their own psychosocial problems. This work has been supported by two NSBRI grants. In the first grant, program architecture was developed to organize the types of content and experiences users can find in the portal. Sample content about depression and interpersonal conflict was also developed as a prototype to demonstrate how training could be delivered through the system. The second NSBRI grant was to complete and evaluate the depression content, including self-treatment of depression. The present project will design and produce an interactive media intervention program to assist persons manage real, ongoing conflicts on long -duration missions. A preliminary evaluation of the conflict intervention will be conducted in a variety of settings where individuals live, train and work together: fire departments and university residence halls. It will also be evaluated in two NSBRI -supported mission simulations when conflicts arise. The goal of this preliminary evaluation is to gather data on response rate, sample characteristics and effect size, in preparation for a randomized, controlled trial. Aims: 1. Create a countermeasure tool that will be used to help crewmembers when interpersonal conflict arises. 2. Test countermeasure in ground studies (possibly through randomized clinical trials) 3. Create final report that provides analysis and conclusion of countermeasure performance and provides future recommendations for its use.

AFT, in coordination with the BHP team, would seek to identify methods to enhance the eating experience on orbit. The proposed work will investigate h ow special meals and eating occasions as well as \"cooking\" on orbit can impact mood, stress, and behavior. The suggested aims of this evaluation are: 1. To identify \"trigger\" foods and occasions to define when mood evaluations will be taken 2. To determi ne the relative impact on mood when trigger foods are provided in varying initial mood states 3. To determine the effect of communal dining as compared to solo dining on mood state 4.

As an outcome of Dr. Morie 's Review and Operational Assessment (SOW), BHP recommends that a computer interaction and virtual technology be used to develop tools that can aid in just -in-time training needs during spaceflight. Virtual technologies can provide high-fidelity training scenarios and are both cost -efficient and more effective than other modes of just -in-time training. BHP also recommends using this type of technology on board to i ncrease public relations outreach programs that can be included in these technologies as outlined in Dr. Morie 's report. For this third task, a SBIR vehicle will be used to develop technologies that provide just -in-time training (both technical and non -technical) and virtual experiences from a public -relations perspective to augment the support felt by crewmembers during a spaceflight mission.

This gap also represents a mitigation gap within the Team Risk. Specifically, this gap is concerned with the identification of optimal composition and selection methods, protocols, and procedures. Tasks that currently comprise this gap include assessments of how personality and cross-cultural interactions may influence how selection and composition can be utilized to create optimal performing and functioning crews for long duration missions. Selection is usually considered a function of initial assessment of astronauts, however, within the context of a long duration mission, we view that selection and composition issues are ongoing factors that should be considered for each crew that is selected. The desired state of knowledge includes optimal selection methods and tools to select and compose crews that are most suitable to the requirements of a long duration mission. Final deliverables in this gap will likely comprise of requirements and standards for crewmember selection, thus the processes that are developed (tools may al so be developed within this gap) will need to be tested in both ground and spaceflight studies for validation purposes. As with the first three gaps, there are three main team outcomes that are examined for tasks that reside within this gap; they include task performance, teamwork, and psychosocial performance. Currently, few tasks are active in this gap. As described above, existing tasks are examining the influence of personality and cross-cultural interactions on crewmember interaction and performance. Future tasks are projected to focus on the specialized roles of crewmembers (both from a task perspective and a social perspective) and the identification of selection/composition strategies that can be utilized for long duration missions (relying on evidence from other similar long duration scenarios, including military studies that examine individuals who are deployed for long periods of time). When the ability to provide the strategies, Researchers will supply a mixture of \"trigger\" foods from holiday eating occasions, common comfort foods, and treats to International Space Station for the test subjects. A mood evaluation will be compiled and validated by the Behavior Health and Performance Project (BHP). At designated times, crew will self -evaluate their mood via questionnaire, eat a prescribed dish, and then re -evaluate mood. The crew will also be asked to evaluate before and after some communal and solo dining occasions as well. Finally, test subjects will be asked to \"cook\" a simple meal and complete the evaluation before and after preparation. The study will provide a quantitative assessment of the impact of food and dining on crew mood, stress, and behavior. The project will partially fill the gap of an acceptable food system in that it can provide guidelines on how to match the psychosocial benefits of food on Earth for the crew in space.

Multi -cultural representation aboard ISS is expected to increase with six -person crews and will also be a prominent feature of future exploration missions back to the moon and Mars. In order to accomplish work tasks, effective team coordination and cooperation among these diverse team members is critical. Ground -based research suggests that cultural diversity impacts team processes, and ul timately, team performance and effectiveness. As such, there is a need to understand the current level of cultural awareness among crew members and its impact on important team outcomes in order to determine future training that may be needed in preparation for exploration missions. Aims: 1. Develop a coding methodology and analyze results for cross -cultural interactions that are observed in archival video footage. 2.

This gap also represents a mitigation gap within the T eam Risk. Specifically, this gap is concerned with the training that is needed to support crewmembers and ensure, optimize, and facilitate crew performance and crew interaction. Tasks that currently comprise this gap include an ongoing study that is seek ing to identify training methods to increase team cohesion among crewmembers as well as assessments of optimal training methods in other industries and governmental agencies that may be relevant to the spaceflight context. Training strategies will focus o n both technical and non-technical competencies but will mostly be relevant to those non -technical aspects of training that have close connections with the behavioral health and performance of astronauts. The desired state of knowledge includes optimal methods and tools to train crews before, during, and after each mission. Final deliverables in this gap will likely comprise of requirements and standards for crewmember training, thus the processes that are developed (tools may also be developed within this gap) will need to be tested in both ground and spaceflight studies for validation purposes. As with the first four gaps, there are three main team outcomes that are examined for tasks that reside within this gap; they include task performance, teamwork, and psychosocial performance. Currently, there are two ongoing assessments and a research study that is focusing on cohesion training that recently began in this gap. Future tasks are projected to focus on evaluations of current training materials and evaluation processes that are currently used and well as an examination of how non -technical training is communicated. Future NRAs in this gap will include a specific study examining the impact of culture (both cross -culturally as well as organizationally) on training as well as another NRA that will focus on how leaders and crewmembers should be trained for their roles and responsibilities.

Most salient will be the extended period (up to three years) for which the cr ew will be confined in a restricted space with each other, a period during which they will depend on each other for their mutual well -being and survival. Moreover, delays or complete lack of communication with ground will place new demands on the crew to function autonomously or asynchronously with resources on the earth. Cooperation, coordination and collaborative efforts will be required to assure successful mission task performance. Both space crews and ground support crews will need to be trained for these new exploration mission requirements in order to assure effective teamwork and team performance, but exactly what to train and how to train it has yet to be defined. The purpose of work under this ITA is to (a) Identify team training requirements for space crews and ground personnel to assure effective mission performance; (b) Review relevant literature to determine the scientific knowledge base to meet the training requirements in (a), (c) Identify team training knowledge gaps that future BHP rese arch should attempt to fill, and (d) Recommend updates to team training human performance standards.

This gap represents a knowledge gap within the Team Risk. Specifically, this gap is concerned with understanding how multiple distributed teams can operate efficiently and effectively in an autonomous environment. Tasks that currently comprise this gap include an ongoing study that is seeking to identify effects that an autonomous context may have on individuals, the development of a scheduling tool that allows crewmembers to be more autonomous from ground control in planning out their activities from day-to-day, and an in- house literature review that seeks to gather relevant evidence about how teams can successfully operate in autonomous environments, both within NASA and in external ground evidence. However, a clear understanding of how best to mitigate this gap remains unknown. The desired state of knowledge includes an identification of the appropriate mitigation strategies to properly address this gap during a long duration mission. Thus, future research in this area will examine how changes in autonomy will affect crewmembers; once this is understood, tasks will be created to address the mitigation strategies that are needed. Final deliverables in this gap will likely comprise of risk characterization and requirements and standards for autonomous crew, thus the strategies that are developed (tools may also be developed within this gap) will need to be tested in both ground and spaceflight studies for validation purposes. As with the first five gaps, there are three main team outcomes that are examined for tasks that reside within this gap; they include task performance, teamwork, and psychosocial performance. Although current research represent cursory examinations of how autonomy may affect crewmembers, future tasks must focus on how best to address issues that may arise with the environmental constraints that a long duration poses in terms of autonomy for both crewmember s and ground control. Future NRAs in this gap will include a specific study examining the impact of autonomous operations on the performance of crew members, as well as two technology efforts to develop tools that may monitor changes in autonomy over the course of a mission. When the ability to understand how best to mitigate the issues related to the autonomous constraints we are faced with when considering long duration missions, it will be appropriate to close this knowledge gap; future tasks related to autonomy will then be subsumed under the appropriate mitigation gap (e.g., Training, Team Gap5). HRP -47065 REV B 134 Task Title: Crew Scheduling Tools Short Title: SPIFE Scheduling Responsible Organization : BHP Supporting Organization : N/A Funding Source : Directed - ITA (Keeton) Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Task Description: Future long duration mission concepts will require a new suite of scheduling and planning tools that deliver improvements to current state -of-the-art technology and processes, including but not limited to: (a) the ability to plan and reason about complex constraint networks on long- range, mid -range, and tactical real -time schedules, (b) the ability for human operators to effectively manipulate and explain schedules generated by automated planning software, and ultimately (c) the ability for the crew, in a semi -autonomous capability, to assume the scheduling and planning roles currently reserved for ground personnel. This proposed pilot study will test the feasibility of using the Scheduli ng and Planning Interface for Exploration (SPIFe) tool, which is already developed by the Ames Research Center (ARC). The software tool will be revised according to lessons learned from each of the pilot studies in simulated space analog environments. Aims: 1.

Communications delays will impact the ability to communicate with Earth in real time, making it difficult to speak with family mem bers and friends for support or to get information from mission control in time to help with a crisis. The crew will be more autonomous and self -sufficient. Higher crew member autonomy may influence psychosocial factors such as crew well -being, perceived t ension and work pressure, group cohesion, as well as task performance. It is hypothesized that crew member mood, group interaction, and performance will be as good or better during high autonomy periods compared to low autonomy periods. Particularly, crew members are anticipated to show more positive effect, greater cohesion and less work pressure in the high autonomy condition. Aims: This project will evaluate the mood, interpersonal interactions and performance of the crew members and mission control pe rsonnel in the 105 -Day mission. These groups will be studied under two conditions: low crew autonomy (where the work schedule is planned by mission control, much like current space missions) and high crew autonomy (where the crew members plan and troubleshoot their own work schedule, much like what would occur during exploration missions). The project will also evaluate the experiment's impact on mission control and on the crew -ground relationship. Predecessors/Successors to this Task: 1. Predecessors: N/ A 2.

This final gap represents a knowledge gap within the Team Risk. Specifically, this gap is concerned with understanding how communication will be impacted by the constraints of a long duration, and further, how this impact will a ffect team performance and team interaction. In this instance, the team is concerned both at the level of the individual crewmembers but a broader 'team' can also be considered as the crew and the ground control team as one unified unit. Current tasks are examining how teams communicate when completing different tasks. However, a clear understanding of how best to mitigate this gap remains unknown. The desired state of knowledge includes an identification of the appropriate mitigation strategies to properly address this gap during a long duration mission. Thus, future research in this area will examine how communication can be used to maintain effective and efficient perform ance among team members, especially when that communication may be constrained, delayed, etc. Final deliverables in this gap will likely comprise of risk characterization and requirements and standards for crew communications, thus the strategies that are developed (tools may also be developed within this gap) will need to be tested in both ground and spaceflight studies for validation purposes. As with the first six gaps, there are three main team outcomes that are examined for tasks that reside within th is gap; they include task performance, teamwork, and psychosocial performance. Although current research represents a cursory examination of how communication may affect crewmembers, future tasks must focus on how best to address issues that may arise wit h the environmental constraints that a long duration poses in terms of both crewmember s and ground control. Future NRAs in this gap will include a specific study examining constrained communication as well as an archival analysis of ground communication from other relevant samples (e.g., aviation). When the ability to understand how best to mitigate the issues related to the communication constraints we are faced with when considering long duration missions, it will be appropriate to close this knowledge gap; future tasks related to communication will then be subsumed under the appropriate mitigation gap (e.g., Training, Team Gap5).

Deliverable: Risk CharacterizationHRP -47065 REV B 154 RISK OF PERFORMANCE ERRORS DUE TO FATIGUE RESULTING FROM SLEEP LOSS, CIRCADIAN DESYNCHRONIZATION, EXTENDED WAKEFULNESS, AND WORK OVERLOAD - CRITICALITY: LUNAR O UTPOST - C , MARS - C Given that astronauts experience sleep loss, circadian desynchronization, work overload and extended wakefulness, there is a possibility a performance decrement will occur, resulting in the crew functioning poorly. Risk Statement Fatigue resulting from sleep loss, circadian desynchronization, extended wakefulness and work overload occur to some extent for ground and flight crews, prior to and during spaceflight missions. Gr ound evidence indicates that fatigue, as experienced by ground and flight crews, may lead to performance errors, which could potentially compromise mission objectives, and consequently the mission itself. Efforts are needed to identify the environmental and mission conditions that interfere with sleep quality, as well as individual vulnerabilities to sleep loss and circadian desynchronization. Research areas to mitigate this risk may also include: development of a self -assessment tool for cognitive function and fatigue; light therapy for phase shifting, alertness and mood disorders; individualized protocols for sleep- wake medication use; sleep dose-response recovery curves and individualized models for countermeasure implementation and optimal work-rest schedules; and other evidence -based means to improve individual sleep quality and reduce fatigue. Risk Context Reportedly, sleep loss has been an issue during spaceflight dating back to the Apollo missions. R esearch in current spaceflight scenarios using objective measures demonstrate that despite countermeasures, chronic sleep loss continues to exist on the Shuttle and the ISS. A necdotal evidence reveals that work overload and extended wakefulness can also occur. Addit ionally, constraints imposed by mission objectives require crews, at times, shift their circadian rhythms, leading to critical tasks occurring against circadian phase. Ground research has consistently demonstrated that lack of adequate amounts of good quality sleep, circadian desynchronization, extended wakefulness and work overload can adversely affect performance capability , health and safety. Operational Relevance Assessment and Recommendations Crews on the International Space Station will continue to face these risk factors. Future missions to the moon, Mars, or other planetary surfaces will likely be both strenuous and fatiguing. Understanding the nature of sleep in space and developing mitigation strategies is therefore relevant in the current spaceflight context and in preparing for the future. Furthermore, sleep and fatigue are risk factors for the other Behavioral Health and Performance Risks (Risk of Performance Errors Due to inadequate Team Cohesion and Performance, Inadequate Selection/Team Composition, Inadequate Training, and Poor Psychosocial Ad aptation; Risk of Adverse Behavioral Conditions; and Risk of Psychiatric Conditions), as well as other aspects related to human health. It is therefore essential to develop countermeasures for issues related to sleep loss, circadian desynchronization , exte nded wakefulness and work overload. BHP research activity aims to assess this risk as well as provide adequate standards and countermeasures for exploration missions. HRP -47065 REV B 155 The risk mitigation strategy of the BHP Element follows the lar ger strategy of the HRP \"from Evidence to Deliverables \" principle, with the involvement of Medical and Mission Operations to help determine the tools and technologies that are relevant for current and future spaceflight. BHP holds an annual working group of subject matter experts who work with BHP and Medical Operations to identify gaps in knowledge and gaps in mitigation. Specific tasks are defined to address the gaps and provide clear, specific deliverables for long duration spaceflight, ensuring an evidence and operationally -based end item. Working with research and operational experts, BHP systematically identifies the appropriate platform to address the gaps prior to validating in spaceflight. To ensure relevancy, stakeholders are engaged in the proce ss from the beginning. Evidence gathered from BHP research characterize Risk, inform Operations and Standards, and yield countermeasures for performance and behavioral health. Risk Mitigation Strategy Gaps Sleep1: What are the most effective tools to detect and assess performance decrements due to fatigue resulting from sleep loss, circadian desynchronization, extended wakefulness, and work overload? This gap addresses the need for a countermeasure technology; specifically, a validated measure (or measures) needed to detect fat igue-related decrements in performance, given the constraints of the spaceflight environment. Ground evidence clearly demonstrates that performance impairments can occur when sleep is attained in quantities similar to that attained by astronauts during training and in flight. A tool is needed through which to objectively assess decrements during mission operations and provide information to the crew surgeon and astronaut, so that appropriate countermeasures, if necessary, can be implemented. While fatig ue-sensitive measures that have been validated are available, this gap is specific to a validated measure(s) that requires minimal crew time, is feasible prior to performing a critical task such as an EVA or lunar surface rover mission, and provides real time feedback about fatigue and predicted performance levels. Cognitive measures that fit these criteria should then be validated as predictors of operational task performance before the gap can be considered adequately mitigated. HRP -47065 REV B 156 Task: Psychomotor Vigila nce Test (PVT) on ISS Short Title : Cognitive Performance/PVT Responsible Organization : BHP Supporting Organization : N/A Funding Source : Directed Other gaps supported by Sleep2, Vigilance (PVT) Self Test (operational name on ISS is Reaction Self Test) is intended to provide astronauts with objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in vigilant attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions. The PVT Self Test is ideal for repeated use in spaceflight because unlike other cognitive tests, it is very brief (3 -minute) while being free of learning effects and aptitude differences that make interpretation of other cognitive measures difficult. The PVT Self Test on the International Space Station can aid astronauts to objectively identify when their performance capability is degraded by various fatigue -related conditions that can occur as a result of ISS operations and time in space (e.g., acute and chronic sleep restriction, sleep shifts, extravehicular activity [EVA], and residual sedation from sleep medications). The following are the objectives (specific aims) of the project: 1) To evaluate the extent to which PVT Self Test performance of astronauts is sensitive to fatigue from sleep loss and circadian disruption during ISS missions. This will include the following conditions evaluated individually and in aggregate: i) extended wake duration between 16 hours; ii) sleep restriction defined as total sleep time >0 and <6 hours per 24- hour period; and iii) circadian perturbation associated with night work and slam shifting. 2) To evaluate the extent to which PVT Self Test performance of astronauts is sensitive to fatigue from work intensity during ISS missions. This will include the following conditions evaluated individually and in aggregate: i) extend work durations up to 16 hours per day; ii) more than 6 consecutive work days without a day off for rest; and iii) work requiring extravehicular activity (EVA). 3) To evaluate the extent to which PVT Self Test performance of astronauts declines with time in mission. 4) To explore the extent to which PVT Self Test performance of astronauts will be sensitive to the carry -over effects of medicat ions for sleep (e.g., zolpidem, ramelteon, etc.) on ISS. 5) To evaluate the extent to which PVT Self Test performance feedback (via a graphical interface) is perceived by ISS astronauts as a useful tool for assessing performance capability. This will be a ddressed throughout the mission by astronaut ratings.

The impairment of cognitive abilities, likely due to fatigue, has been identified as a factor leading to errors in performance. In nominal operations, pauses, unnecessary movements and performance inefficiency may reflect cognitive impairment. Preventative countermeasures are necessary to reduce this risk and improve crew safety for current and future robotic operations. In this project, subjects will be trained to perform simulated robotics tasks under realistic astronaut schedules. Using a within -subjects design, our experiments will investigate how the pr oposed fatigue countermeasures affect both cognitive and task performance, thereby enabling their relationship to be understood. If this correlation can be established, we will provide more evidence that these assessment tools could be used as indicators o f fitness -for- duty. Specific Aims 1) Characterize the changes in cognitive function during robotic operations that affect performance; 2) Validate proxy cognitive assessment tests such as the Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows (WinSCAT) o r Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) as predictors of performance changes in a complex operational task, and; 3) Test the efficacy of fatigue countermeasures (e.g., light, caffeine, modafinil) to improve cognition during robotic operations.

Many existing cognitive performance test batteries consist of synthetic tasks that, while they may probe isolated cognitive functions, provide an incomplete and unconvincing picture of an individual's true cognitive capacity within the total context of space missions. These 'laboratory' measures may appear unrelated to the real -world environment, which can lead to user non- compliance or rejection. The present task aims to develop a technique for integra ting traditional cognitive performance measures with assessment of the system and mission in which the individual must operate, yielding a quantified measure of the person's cognitive ability to perform specific jobs in space. The aim of this task is to de velop a prototype countermeasure: an entertaining and scientifically rigorous assessment tool, integrated with a sleep/fatigue model and a quantified workload estimate for each task. This will be accomplished by selecting tests based on task analyses of what the astronaut actually has to do, using the Fatigue Avoidance Scheduling Tool (FAST) to predict performance capacity as a function of sleep/rest, and integrating a mathematical vector to quantify the workload of specific tasks. The resulting \"Person- System-Mission (PSM) index\" provides a totally new and unique way not only to assess present cognitive capability, but to diagnose specific causes of decrement, and to suggest remedial actions.

Required Platforms: Ground based activity Sleep 2: How is performance in space flight affected by fatigue due to sleep loss, circadian desynchronization, extended wakefulness and work overload? This knowledge gap addresses the need to characterize the risk of performance errors due to fatigue resulting from sleep loss, circadian desynchronization, extended wakefulness and work overload. The amount and degree of fatigue -related performance decrements that occur during spaceflight is currently unknown. Ground evidence clearly demonstrates that performance impairments can occur when sleep is attained in quantities similar to that attained by astronauts during training and in flight. Laboratory studies using validated cognitive measures demonstrate that fatigue causes performance errors, while evaluations in operational environments (i.e. medical and aviation industry), where shift work, work overload, and sleep loss are common risk factors, also demonstrate a higher likelihood of errors. A correlation between sleep quantity, circadian desynchronization, work overload, and performance in spaceflight has not been documented. Performance data from operational tasks in spaceflight are not available; therefore efforts to collect performance data through cognitive measures are under way. Evaluations should be made within subject before and during spaceflight, as well as comparing ground normative data to flight normative data. Tasks in Gap Sleep 1 which will validate cognitive measures t o operational tasks, may help inform the findings from the current investigations in Gap Sleep 2. Additionally, tasks in Sleep 1 that validate cognitive measures as predictors of operational task performance will also help address this gap. HRP -47065 REV B 160 Task: Cognitive Performance/Stress in Simulated Space Environment Short Title : Cognitive Performance/Stress Responsible Organization : BHP Supporting Organization : N/A Funding Source : Directed Other gaps supported by this task: Sleep1 Task Description: In spaceflight, crew members are frequently required to do many different critical tasks with associated stress and fatigue factors. The development of embedded performance tests that can be successfully related to performance capability m etrics will give the crew member and Mission Control information on the best time to perform critical events and an evaluation of the need for countermeasures. The purpose of this study is to collect cognitive performance and stress information on astronauts and mission support personnel to identify periods of fatigue and identify stress during analog missions, and develop normative databases on fatigue and stress in analog environments for comparison to space flight. The observational research study will test tools that measure performance and stress in crew members and mission support personnel working and living in simulated space environments under conditions similar to those crew members experience aboard the International Space Station and on Lunar mi ssions. Specific aims of the study are as follows: 1. Test the usefulness of three brief validated software -based cognitive performance tests (PVT SelfTest, Digit Symbol Substitution Test and the Descending Subtraction Test), which will collectively be kno wn as the Penn Neurobehavioral Test Battery. Data will be collected on crew members and mission support personnel. Findings from this aim will also inform Sleep1 and Bmed3 (development and validation of measurement tools). 2.

HRP -47065 REV B 162 Sleep3 Does sleep loss continue on long duration spaceflight or is there adaptation? What is the nature of circadian desynchronization, extended wakefulness and work overload over long duration missions? This knowledge gap as addresses the need to characterize the nature of sleep, circadian desynchronization, extended wakefulness and work overload, over the course of a long duration mission in space. Anecdotal reports indicate that many crew members often do not sleep for the duration of their scheduled sleep period. Causes of reduced sleep may be due to mission requirements, which require shifts in sleep/wake schedules, and various environmental factors, such as noise levels and temperature. In order to assess accurately the degree to which sleep is disrupted, and the degree to which circadian shifting, work overload and extended wakefulness occur in flight, objective measures are needed. The Actiwatch protocol currently on Shuttle and ISS serves as a research monitoring tool, collecting sleep data throughout the course of a mission; this measure also provides important operational feedback for flight surgeons regarding crew member sleep. More precise monitoring tools that provide useful feedback in real time are needed to optimally support teams in future missions. Task: Sleep/Wake Actigraphy and Light Exposure During Spaceflight Short Title : Actigraphy Responsible Organization : BHP Supporting Organization : N/A Funding Source : NRA Other gaps supported by this task: Sleep1, Sleep2, Sleep8 Task Description: The success and effectiveness of manned space flight depends on the ability of crew members to maintain a high level of cognitive performance and vigi lance while operating and monitoring sophisticated instrumentation. Astronauts, however, commonly experience sleep disruption and may experience misalignment of circadian phase during space flight. Both of these conditions are associated with impairment of alertness and cognitive performance. A survey of 58 crew members from 9 shuttle missions revealed that most suffered from sleep disruption and were unable to sleep more than six hours per day of flight as compared to 7.9 hours per day on the ground. Ground- based studies have revealed that chronic exposure to such partial sleep loss results in progressive decrements in neurobehavioral performance during waking hours. Relatively little is known of the severity or cause of space flight -induced insomnia in sh ort duration mission, and less is know n about the effect of long -duration space flight on sleep and circadian rhythm organization. The aims of this experiment include 1) characterizing sleep and sleep disruption over shuttle and long duration missions; 2) determining whether sleep disruption leads to subjective dissatisfaction with sleep and daytime alertness; 3) characterizing the relationship between sleep and sleep medication use; 4) determining the feasibility of the Actiwatch protocol as a monitoring technology in flight.

Sleep4: How can individual astronauts ' vulnerabilities to sleep loss and circadian rhythm disruption best be determined? While it is necessary to determine the impact of environmental factors on sleep and performance, as well as the mission requirements that disrupt circadian rhythms and sleep, external stressors impact individuals differently. As discussed in the Sleep Evidence Book, recent studies have documented that there are large stable (trait-like) differences among individuals in the degree of cognitive deficits experienced during sleep loss (Van Dongen, Baynard, Maislin, and Dinges, 2004; Klerman and Dijk, 2005). Identifying characteristics (i.e. biomarkers) that mediate the degree to which an external stressor affects the individual will inform individual countermeasure recommendations. BHP is therefore working to determine optimal ways for id entifying individual vulnerabilities to sleep loss and circadian desynchronization.

Required Platforms: Ground based study Sleep5: How can light be used to prevent and mitigate health, performance, and safety problems due to circadian, neuroendocrine, and neurobehavioral disruption, for flight, surface and ground crews? This gap addresses the development of light as a countermeasure for circadian entrainment, alertness, and fatigue. Ground studies indicate that bright light serves as an effective countermeasure for shifting circadian rhythms. Recent studies reveal that wavelengths of light around the blue -end of the spectrum may b e even more effective at circadian entrainment than standard white light, and may also enhance mood and alertness. Other wavelengths, such as those associated with green and yellow, may also produce neurobehavioral effects, such as daytime alertness and fatigue, respectively. The timing, duration, intensity, and wavelength of the light impact countermeasure effectiveness; current laboratory efforts aim to investigate the optimal regimen for implementing lighting as a countermeasure in space. Requirements for lighting specifications in a spaceflight habitat are needed, as well as medical requirements for utilizing light as a safe and effective countermeasure. HRP -47065 REV B 166 Task: Operational Evaluation of Photic Countermeasure to Improve Alertness, Performance, and Mood during Nightshift Work on a 105 day Simulated Human Exploration Mission to Mars. Short Title : RCS -105 Photic CM Responsible Organization : BHP Supporting Organization : NSBRI Funding Source : NSBRI Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Task Descriptio n: The success of long -duration missions depends on the ability of the crew to be alert and maintain high levels of cognitive function while operating complex, technical equipment. Optimal human health, performance and safety during spaceflight requires sufficient sleep and synchrony between the circadian pacemaker which regulates the timing of sleep, endocrine function, alertness and performance and the timing of the imposed sleep -wake schedule. Crew members of the 105 -day experiment will be required to work one night shift every fifth night. This schedule will likely result in sleep loss and circadian misalignment, especially when lighting conditions are similar to those experienced during spaceflight. Mission controllers will work 24 -hour shifts, also resulting in both sleep loss and circadian misalignment. It has been well documented in laboratory and field studies that both working the night shift and working extended -duration shifts result in negative effects on alertness, performance and mood. This study will validate the efficacy and operational feasibility of a lighting countermeasure to improve alertness and performance during night -shift work occurring during long- duration space missions. Specific Aims 1. Evaluate the feasibility of monitoring sleep and circadian neuroendocrine rhythms during the 105 -day experiment. 2. Test the hypothesis that sleep, alertness, performance and mood will be impaired during acute circadian misalignment associated with night -shift work operations. 3. Test the hyp othesis that alertness, performance and mood of crew members exposed to shorter wavelength light (between 485 to 525 nm) during the night shift in the console monitoring room will be significantly better than when those same crew members are exposed to int ermediate (545 to 555 nm) or longer (620 to 690 nm) wavelength light during the night shift. 4. Test the hypothesis that the alertness, performance and mood of the external mission controllers will be impaired during the final third of their extended -duration, 24 -hour work shift as compared with the first third of that same work shift. 5. Test the hypothesis that the alertness, performance and mood of external missions controllers exposed to shorter wavelength light during the final third of their extende d-duration work shift will be significantly better than when those same crew members are exposed to intermediate or longer wavelength light during the night shift. Throughout the 105- day experiment, a variety of measurements will be obtained to assess sleep, performance, alignment of the circadian system, and melatonin levels. If a lighting countermeasure proves effective, it could negate or reduce the need for pharmaceutical interventions, with potentially lingering side effects, during long missions. A l ighting countermeasure could also be beneficial in other unusual non- 24 hour lighting cycles and may negate the effects of fatigue on work performance.

Required Platforms: Ground study HRP -47065 REV B 167 Task: Evaluation of Photic Countermeasures for Circadian Entrainment of Neurobehavioral Performance and Sleep -Wake Regulation Before and During Spaceflight Short Title : Blue versus White Light Responsible Or ganization : BHP Supporting Organization : NSBRI Funding Source : NSBRI Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Task Description : To synchronize astronauts' circadian sleep -wake schedules to variable launch times, timed exposure to bright light and darkness in the crew quarters during the week -long pre -launch quarantine period has been used since 1990. Although successful at circadian entrainment, bright light protocols are complex to administer and astronauts' compliance is compromised because bright lig ht glare compromises computer/television screen visibility, and increases frequency of headaches, irritability and nausea. Moreover, bright light remains unavailable as an in -flight countermeasure, requiring astronauts to rely upon hypnotics or wake -promoting therapeutics to provide symptomatic relief. Recent advances reveal that the human circadian pacemaker is most sensitive to shorter wavelength light for both phase shifting and direct enhancement of alertness and performance. Recent research indicates short- wavelength light (~460nm -512nm) in the blue/green range facilitates circadian phase shifting. The aim of this investigation is to test the efficacy of exposure to short wavelength green light at a standard intensity for pre -launch and in- flight phase shifting. The current study tests the circadian phase- shifting efficacy of exposure to short wavelength light throughout scheduled wake times on a protocol designed to simulate the schedule of crew members during the pre -launch quarantine period on a miss ion that requires an 8- hour phase advance of the sleep -wake schedule. The goal is to demonstrate that exposure to ambient short wavelength fluorescent light will synchronize human circadian rhythms to a shifted sleep/wake schedule within 4 -5 days, enhancing alertness and performance during the biological night. During this proposed 8- day ground -based simulation, participants' sleep- wake schedules will be advanced by 8 hours. This advance shift will be done in 2 different protocol designs: 1) a \"slam\" shift in which the sleep episode is abruptly advanced by 8 hours and then maintained at this advanced time for 4 days, and 2) a gradual shift in which the sleep episode is advanced by 1.6 hours each day for 5 days until an 8 hour advance is achieved. A total of 44 subjects will be studied in the project. They will be randomized to 1 of 4 protocol conditions which differ by light (ordinary indoor white light (~90 lux) or 90 lux polychromatic green light) and by shift (slam or gradual) so that there will be 11 subjects/group. The 4 conditions are 1) white light slam shift, 2) green light slam shift, 3) white light gradual shift, and 4) green light gradual shift. Specific aims are to: 1. Test the hypothesis that exposure to ambient polychromatic short wavelength l ight from fluorescent lamps will be more effective than exposure to an equal illuminance of ambient polychromatic white light from standard fluorescent lamps in shifting the circadian rhythms of test subjects, as measured by dim -light melatonin onset (DLMO), in response to both a gradual 8- hour advance and to an abrupt shift of their sleep- wake schedule. 2. Test the hypothesis that alertness and neurobehavioral performance in dim light on a constant routine during times at which crew members should be awa ke on the simulated mission will be significantly greater following 4 -5 days of exposure to ambient polychromatic green light vs. ambient white light of equal illuminance, due to more effective circadian entrainment. 3. Test the hypothesis that alertness and neurobehavioral performance will be significantly better on the first night of exposure to ambient polychromatic short wavelength light vs. ambient white light of equal illuminance, prior to the induced circadian phase shifts, due to the immediate aler ting effects of exposure to ambient polychromatic short wavelength light. 4. Test the hypothesis that sleep efficiency and total sleep time will be significantly increased and latency to persistent sleep and wake time after sleep onset will be significant ly decreased during the sleep episode following 4-5 days of exposure to ambient polychromatic green light vs. ambient white light of equal illuminance, due to more effective circadian entrainment.

Required Platforms: Grou nd study Task: Optimizing Light for Long Duration Space Exploration Short Title : Optimizing Light Responsible Organization : BHP Supporting Organization : NSBRI Funding Source : NSBRI Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Task Description: The goal of this project is to determine the optimal lighting for use as a countermeasure to sleep and circadian disruption for astronauts. Sleep deficits are a risk factor during space missions. The resulting physiological and behavioral changes from circadian disruption can threaten the success of a mission by diminishing alertness, cognitive ability, and psychomotor performance. Currently, over 45% of all medications taken in space are sleep aids (Putcha et al., 1999). Despite the use of these, more than half of the astronauts still get only between 3 and 6 hours of sleep per night during space flight (Barger et al., 2009). Light is the primary stimulus for human circadian regulation. While on Earth, humans have a 24 -hour day/night cycle to maintain healthy circadian entrainment. In space, astronauts must contend with either a rapidly changing or severely disrupted day/night cycle and must work in a dimly lit spacecraft interior with few or no windows. Bright white light has already been implemented as a pre- launch countermeasure but has yet to be used during space flight. Providing sufficient light intensities to work areas in the International Space Station (ISS), the planned Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), and future lunar habitats raises several concerns, among which are heat production, energy consumption, and upmass. Improving these factors requires a better understanding of how different artificial and natural ambient light sources regulate the human circadian system. From these data it may be possible to optimize astronaut and ground crew light exposure both as a stimulus for vision as well as a countermeasure for sleep and circadian disturbances before or during space exploration. To develop a lighting countermeasure for space exploration, it is vital to determine the sensitivity of astronauts' circadian systems to both ambient and artificial lighting stimuli. The specific aims of this current investigation are as follows: 1. Assess the ocular safety of light exposure from LEDs at intensity levels higher than those currently specified for visual stimulation in space habitats. 2. Determine the acute neuroendocrine, alerting, and performance enhancing potency of the ambient extraterrestrial light as filtered through spacesuit visors or glazed windows for Moon and Mars missions. Test the hypothesis that ambient lunar and Martian light, as filtered through spacesuit visors, will suppress melatonin less and will be weaker for enhancing alertness and performance compared to ambient daylight on Earth.

These effects, however, have only been examined during the night using relatively bright light and recent evidence suggests that the spectral sensitivity of the circadian photoreception system may depend on the intensity and duration of light and that there may be changes in spectral sensitivity during the day. While blue light therapy to facilitate circadian adaptation and alertness has been proposed based largely on the effects of melatonin suppression at night, these data may not be transferable to the effects at other times of day (when melatonin is not produced) or for other effects of light. Before blue light is operationalized, three fundamental questions remain to be determined: 1) Does the spectral sensitivity depend on the intensity of light? 2) Do all non -visual effects of l ight have the same spectral sensitivity? 3) Is the spectral sensitivity of the circadian photoreception system different between the day and the night? Failure to address these questions may result in deployment of suboptimal or less energy -efficient light ing schedules. The proposed project will test whether the spectral sensitivity of the circadian photoreception system is intensity -dependent, response -dependent or time- of-day dependent, by comparing the effects of exposure to monochromatic light during th e day and the night, at both high and low intensities, on circadian phase resetting and enhancement of alertness and performance. The first aim of the investigation is to compare the melatonin suppression, phase resetting and alerting effects of exposure to dim 460 nm and 555 nm monochromatic light exposures at night, and compare these data to previously collected findings for bright light exposure at night using the same protocol. A second aim is to test the effects of exposure to bright 460 nm and 555 nm monochromatic light during the daytime. The third aim will test the effects of exposure to dim 460 nm and 555 nm monochromatic light during the daytime.

Required Platforms: Ground study HRP -47065 REV B 171 Task: Feasibility Pilot Study on Acute Biological and Behavioral Responses to the Solid State Lighting Modules (SSLM) for the International Space Station Short Title : SSLM Responsible Organization : BHP Supporting Organization : N/A Funding Source : Directed Other gaps supported by t his task: Task Description: Currently, the International Space Station (ISS) uses General Luminaire Assemblies (GLAs) tha fluorescent lamps for illuminating the astronauts ' working and living environments. Solid- state light in the form of L Emitting Diodes (LEDs) is an attractive candidate for replacing the GLAs on the ISS as well as all future manned sp vehicles and habitats. With respect to spaceflight, the advantages of LEDs over conventional incandescent and fluor lighting syste ms include lower upmass, power consumption, and heat generation, as well as fewer toxic materials. In addition, LEDs have greater resistance to damage and longer lamp life expectancy. Engineers at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) have developed a prototype Soli d-State Lighting Module (SSLM) that ha installed on board the ISS. In a consensus document between the KSC engineers, lighting experts from Johnson Spa Center (JSC), research management from JSC and NASA 's biomedical research partner, the National Space Biomed Research Institute (NSBRI), it was recommended that the SSLMs could provide reasonably equivalent light compar the GLAs currently onboard ISS. Two crewmembers onboard the ISS have assessed the recently installed SSLM pro to be a cceptable for supporting vision. With regard to the efficacy of the SSLMs for astronaut circadian regulation, was less certainty. It was suggested that further research was needed to determine the biological and behavioral effic the SSLMs. The following specific aims concern pilot testing of light emitted by the SSLMs for acute biological and behavioral This work would provide feasibility data for future testing of both acute and longer -term effects of SSLM light. 1) Build a simulat ion of the ISS Crew Quarters with both internal and external illumination provided by SSLMs. 2) Run three -day studies with a single volunteer each, collecting data on visual sensitivity, melatonin secretion, subj alertness, objective alertness, neuro behavioral responses and polysomnography. 7) Analyze the data and write a project report with recommendations based on the pilot study results.

Required Platforms: Flight # of Subjects Initial Upmass Sleep 6: How can individual crew members most effectively and safely use sleep and alertness medications prior to and during spaceflight? Evidence indicates that astronauts in the Shuttle environment sleep about 6 hours a night on avera ge. Sleep is also markedly reduced during pre-flight training. It is therefore not surprising that sleep medications serve as a primary mitigation strategy during spaceflight missions. Recent data indicate that, in some cases, crewmembers note taking medications twice in one night. The sleep medications used in spaceflight are FDA approved for sleep periods of 8 hours or more, but they have not been studied for their effects on waking cognitive functions during an alarm -based awakening from sleep (under 8 hours) that has occurred in spaceflight numerous times. There is a need to identify the cognitive effects of sleep medications during such premature awakenings, and to identify the sleep medications (and dosages) that produce the fewest cognitive effects an d adverse reactions in individual astronauts. In preparation for future long duration missions where crews become increasingly autonomous, it will be important to provide guidelines and management methods for medications related to behavioral health. Task: Develop and Implement Operational Ground Testing Protocols to Individualize Astronaut Sleep Medication Efficacy and Individual Effects (pilot study) Short Title : Responsible Organization : BHP Individualized Meds Protocols Supporting Organization : N/A Funding Source : Directed Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Task Description: The aim of the pilot study was to test the feasibility of a protocol to use with astronauts and other NASA personnel (e.g., flight surgeons, flight directors and fligh t controllers) to assess potential carry over effects from sleep medications used during spaceflight operations (including overseas training periods), and following an abrupt awakening from sleep. This information is needed to establish optimal and individually tailored usage of sleep medications by key personnel relative to operational demands. This feasibility study helped to determine the percentage change in sleep inertia from using a medication compared to normal sleep inertia. Subject participants, in a controlled setting in the Crew Quarters Facility at JSC, underwent several awakenings during two nights of sleep (one night with the medication, another night with a placebo). Cognitive performance, using a set of three measures, was evaluated at each awakening, along with operational task performance. This process occurred under the direction of the study Principal Investigator, a NASA Flight Surgeon.

The precursor to this investigation was a pilot study which supported the scientific feasibility of conducting a randomized, double -blind, placebo controlled study of sleep medication effects on alarm -based awakenings. Preliminary analysis from the p ilot study indicated differences in performance upon abrupt awakening between the sleep medication and placebo conditions. Thus, the pilot data also support the likelihood of new scientific and clinical insights from the proposed Phase II studies with NASA astronauts. In Phase II, two randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, cross -over trials will be conducted. The hypnotic medication and the placebo will be indistinguishable by subjects.

Required Platforms: Ground study Sleep7 Does sleep loss, circadian desynchronization, work overload and extended wakefulness as it is experienced on long duration missions, affect well -being, crew interactio n and performance? If so, how? The Standing Review Panel noted the integration between chronic sleep loss and behavioral health and performance outcomes. Likewise, when discussing the relevance of sleep loss and stress in flight surgeons and those in the e xternal research community have referred to a growing body of evidence that demonstrate associations between chronic sleep loss, circadian desynchrony, and work overload, and psychological, psychosocial, and physiological decrements. Chronic stressors such as prolonged sleep loss increase the likelihood of adverse behavioral outcomes; likewise, adverse behavioral outcomes can lead to chronic sleep loss. The sleep and circadian systems are fundamental aspects of psychological, psychosocial and physiological well being. Understanding how decrements in sleep and circadian rhythmicity impact HRP -47065 REV B 175 behavioral health on orbit is essential to mitigating risk and preparing for future long duration exploration missions. Presently, BHP plans to address this gap by incorporating measures of sleep duration in investigations in the BMed risks and Team risk. Task: The role of sleep and circadian phase on crew safety, performance and psychological health during long- term analog space missions Short Title : Roses Study Responsi ble Organization : BHP Supporting Organization : NASA Planetary Science Funding Source : BHP and NASA Planetary Science Other gaps supported by this task: Sleep 5, Sleep 6, Sleep 8, Sleep 9, Sleep 10; Team1; Bmed 2, Bmed 6 Task Description: The Antarc tic environment mimics many of the conditions that will be experienced during long -duration missions to Mars, particularly with regard to the unusual light environment, the potential for circadian rhythm and sleep disorders, the isolation and close quarter ing of crews and the risk of developing psychological disorders. It is well established that exposure to the unusual light -dark cycles of an Antarctic winter, even with access to artificial light, increases the risk of developing sleep problems and circadi an desynchrony which in turn decreases performance and cognitive capabilities. There is a bidirectional relationship between insomnia, and depression and anxiety: sleep disruption and fatigue can lead to anxiety and depression, which themselves can produce insomnia. Moreover, depression, anxiety, and fatigue can exacerbate or create interpersonal conflict, which may already be present due to the prolonged time spent in isolation in a small group. Monitoring techniques to identify sleep -wake changes as a bio marker for cognitive or psychological disorders are needed to provide early warning of threats to crew health and safety on long missions and to prompt early interventions. Ideally, such monitoring and intervention techniques should be non -invasive, easy t o comply with, able to prevent fatigue -related accidents and injuries, and maximize performance. This investigation aims to pilot test an integrated program to assess sleep, circadian phase, cognitive functioning, behavioral health, and safety in isolated and confined environments. This study is a first step toward building a model to predict psychosocial problems prior to their onset, based on the timing of sleep and circadian phase. These pilot data will also support the future development and evaluation of techniques to ameliorate sleep and behavioral health problems. The investigators have already developed a range of techniques to assess behavioral health, sleep and cognition, and circadian phase, as well as to treat depression. Some of these technol ogies have already been field -tested, including with the Phoenix Lander crews, and with Space Shuttle and International Space Station crews, and in Antarctica. The next step is to combine them in an integrated program. The proposed investigation tests the program with personnel wintering over in Antarctica. Antarctic winter missions are an excellent analog for Mars and other planetary missions because both involve: (1) isolation and confinement; (2) long durations; (2) exposure to unusual light -dark cycles; (3) small crew size; (4) the dependence on technology to support life; (5) omnipresent lethal risks; (6) hazardous EVAs, or excursions from the station, which require an operational plan and specialized equipment.

Subsequent work could also be incorporated into other investigations in the B -med and Team risks. Required Delivery Milestone: This task informs risk characterization and countermeasure development for long - duration space missions. Required Platforms : Analog study in Antarctica Sleep8: How can predictions of the effects of chronic work -rest schedules on performance be used to prevent work overload and mitigate risk? Research studies have shown a discrepancy between objective and subjective measur es of fatigue ; participants subject to chronic sleep loss have reported low levels of fatigue but performed poorly on fatigue -sensitive measures (VanDongen et al., 2003). These findings suggesting individuals may not be fully aware of their fatigue levels, increasing the likelihood that they will conduct a critical task, and that an error may result (VanDongen et al., 2003). Participants in sunlit analog environments have also indicated that they continued to work for hours on end without feeling a need for sleep, a potential concern since lack of sleep and fatigue can affect performance. In future space missions to the Moon or Mars, crewmembers will be given more autonomy to plan and carry out their activities due to the long distances involved and the ta sks that will be needed to explore a planetary surface. Recommended optimal work rest schedules need to be provided so that crews can make informed decisions around work and rest. Optimally, tools that integrate sleep-wake data and other relevant data poi nts (i.e. light exposure, medication, caffeine), and provide individualized predictions of the effects on performance of chronic work -rest schedules (e.g., sleep restriction at different circadian phases; split -sleep [nap] schedules at different circadian phases) could aid both flight and ground crews in managing fatigue and establishing revised schedules in real time to help mitigate risk. HRP -47065 REV B 177 Task: Designing Individual Countermeasures to Reduce Sleep Disruption and Improve Performance and Alertness in Space Short Title : Mathematical Modeling Harvard Responsible Organization : BHP Supporting Organization : NSBRI Funding Source : NSBRI Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Task Description: Objective neurobehavioral performance, subjective alertness, and sleep are critically important to astronaut and ground -based crew health and to ensure the success of space missions. Neurobehavioral performance and alertness are affected by changes in circadian rhythms, homeostatic sleep/wake regulation and sleep inert ia, and the interactions of these processes. During space missions, circadian rhythms and sleep are disrupted for crewmembers in space, and for supporting teams on Earth. It is therefore imperative that schedules and countermeasures are designed to optimiz e individual performance, alertness, and quality sleep relative to operational requirements. The investigators have developed and validated a mathematical model of the human circadian pacemaker, performance and alertness that includes the key processes of circadian rhythms, sleep/wake homeostasis and sleep inertia. The software implementing this model has been used by NASA and consultants when designing light countermeasures for astronaut pre -launch schedules. The current study aims to develop a mathematical method for optimal design of countermeasures and schedules after a change in timing of sleep, light or critical tasks. Specific aims are to: (1) Replace the current assumption that an individual sleeps when scheduled to sleep, with probabilities of sle ep and wake during those times; (2) Improve daily assessment of sleep and sleep disruption using actigraphy data; (3) Add statistical features including confidence limits to the predictions; (4) Update the software per astronaut and ground crew requests fo r specific features and reports. The basic mathematical work will focus on individual, rather than group, predictions and use novel non- linear mathematical and statistical measures. These projects address NASA's objectives to improve the design of individu al countermeasures to reduce sleep disruption and improve performance and alertness in space and on Earth.

Required Platforms: Ground study HRP -47065 REV B 178 Task: Physiologically -Based Modeling of Sleep -Wake Scheduling and the Effects of Pharmaceuticals Short Title : Modeling Sleep/Wake Scheduling Responsible Organization: BHP Supporting Organization : NSBRI Funding Source : NSBRI Other gaps supported by this task: Task Description: NASA astronauts and ground crew must meet high- level cognitive and physical demands around -the-clock. These tasks place extreme stress on human physiology, which evolved under conditions of 24 -hour days with ample rest. The effects of sleep loss, circadian misalignment and extended schedules on performance and alertness pose serious risks to mission success. It is therefore cruc ial that countermeasures are developed for optimizing schedules and guiding pharmaceutical use. Mathematical modeling provides a means of predicting performance and alertness under many different, including untested, conditions. Improved knowledge of sleep physiology has enabled development of more sophisticated models. A physiologically -based model of the sleep- wake switch has been developed and applied to sleep deprivation, shift work, pharmacologic stimuli and fatigue. Meanwhile, a circadian model develo ped at the Brigham and Women's Hospital has been applied to predicting neurobehavioral performance and alertness, designing pre- mission countermeasures and optimizing mission scheduling. This project will combine the sleep -wake switch and circadian models , including physiological interactions between these systems, yielding the most comprehensive model to date. This will result in improved estimates of performance measures and new diagnostics for assessing schedule suitability on an individual basis, including chronotype (morning/evening preference). Alloying complementary expertise in sleep -wake switch and circadian modeling will thus provide a significant step forward in assessment and design of mission schedules. Since the model is physiological, it is readily extended to include pharmaceuticals. It will thus also predict the efficacy of drugs such as caffeine, modafinil and melatonin as countermeasures for reducing fatigue and combating insomnia. This will facilitate recommendations for administration b efore, during and after missions.

The proposed research will us e a laboratory -based study to acquire critically -needed information on the effects on performance of high cognitive workload and sleep restriction (Specific Aim 1). The study hypothesizes that as sleep restriction accumulates, it will potentiate the perfor mance- impairing effects of higher cognitive workload. Another key goal of the study is to provide astronauts with an objective way to identify performance changes and the need for countermeasures for fatigue from sleep restriction and high workload. To thi s end, the project will complete validation of the sensitivity of the 3 -minute PVT SelfTest to high workload and sleep restriction. PVT SelfTest feedback interfaces will also be evaluated, and the task will be tested in analog operations to establish its technical feasibility (Specific Aim 2). Tertiary goals of the project include identification of biobehavioral predictors of differential vulnerability to the cognitive effects of sleep restriction and high workload (Specific Aim 3), and development of individualized biomathematical models that predict performance on the PVT SelfTest during high workload (Specific Aim 4).

Required Platforms: Ground study Sleep9 What are the countermeasures needed to recover from chronic partial sleep loss, work overload, and/or slam sleep shifting, and that permi t recycle back into the same sleep -restricted schedules? Efforts to prevent and mitigate the effects of sleep loss, circadian desynchronization, extended wakefulness and work overload are underway, however, even with regular countermeasure use on orbit, sleep loss continues to occur during spaceflight, with some Shuttle crewmembers reporting minimal amounts of sleep, particularly prior to conducing critical mission tasks (ISS studies are currently ongoing) . Evidence reveals that recovery sleep occurs following missions. Investigations are underway through other agencies to assess the amount of recovery sleep needed to mitigate the effects of chronic sleep loss, and permit recycle back into sleep. Additionally, given the effects of sleep loss on fatigue and performance, Operations has reques ted evidence based training programs that will provide guidance relate to treatment and recovery (i.e. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy). Such information will be instrumental for not only crewmembers, but also their families, ground support teams, and other m edical personnel regarding strategies to improve sleep quantity and quality. These efforts will be pursued as part of a larger assessment of chronic spaceflight stressors through the BMed Risk, in conjunction with Flight Medical Operations.

Required Platforms: Ground study Sleep10: What flight rules and requirements improve sleep, circadian desynchronization, fatigue and work overload, to reduce performance errors? Aspects of spaceflight missions such as flight rules and requirements, can adversely impact sleep and circadian rhythms. Ground controllers may also face increased risk due to schedule shifting and sleep loss. While some factors (such as noise in -flight) cannot be controlled, others, such as commander policies, may be informed by a systematic assessment that can be evaluated statistically. BHP aims to assess the effectiveness of current flight rules and requirements in order to develop informed recommendations for future long duration missions. HRP -47065 REV B 183 Task: Survey of On -Orbit Sleep Quality (Sleep Quality Questionnai re) Short Title : Sleep Quality Questionnaire SQQ Responsible Organization : BHP Supporting Organization : N/A Funding Source : Directed Other gaps supported by this task: Task Description: This study consists of two phases: Shuttle and ISS. The aim o f both phases is to survey and interview current astronauts regarding their sleep behaviors and sleep quality on Earth, during training periods, and during Shuttle or ISS missions, utilizing a measure composed of both open- ended and close -ended items, as w ell as a follow -up interview. Sleep and circadian issues have been noted by astronauts since pre -Apollo missions. Empirical research evaluating sleep quantity during spaceflight reveals some crew members are attaining reduced hours of sleep in - flight at ti mes prior to conducting critical mission tasks. Aspects of the spaceflight environment, such as loud noise and sleep restraint use, may contribute to sleep loss and fatigue. Given the large body of ground evidence that demonstrates sleep loss and fatigue n egatively affect performance, it is essential to fully understand what environmental factors affect sleep, and develop strategies and policies to mitigate the effects of these factors. The study will provide needed information for aiding the individual astronaut to experience improved sleep during spaceflight missions. Such recommended strategies and policies will lead to better management of sleep and fatigue by addressing crew health and habitability standards. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the en vironmental factors and mission operations of long duration planetary missions will continue to pose challenges to the sleep and circadian system. As a result, findings from the proposed study will help inform and establish flight rules and requirements fo r future exploration missions.

The proposed study provides an operational opportunity, in a Mars Time Analog, to apply these countermeasures and begin evaluating their acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy in a real - time, field setting. This study will evaluate countermeasures that may be used by ground personnel controlling current missions (Shuttle and International Space Station) as well as by those controlling future mis sions (Lunar and Mars) as there will continue to be rovers and unmanned space craft including orbiters, landers and rovers sent to Mars. The results of this work will benefit the current unmanned NASA robotic programs and ultimately human exploration missions to both the moon and Mars. The proposed study will examine both Phoenix Mars Lander controllers who work on a Mars sol schedule and those who work on a traditional Earth sol schedule. Major outcome measures include sleep duration (objective evaluation via actigraphy), subjective alertness (collected via daily log) and performance (evaluated with the Psychomotor Vigilance Task and other embedded and/or unobtrusive performance measures).

Such schedules instigate significant acute and chronic sleep deprivation an d consequently fatigue. Although the effects are often unrecognized, both the acute and chronic lack of sleep substantially degrades a federal air marshal 's ability to react and think quickly, to make good decisions, and to recognize when fatigue is impair ing his or her own performance and safety. Further, both acute and chronic sleep deprivation adversely affects personal health, increasing the risk of gastrointestinal and heart disease, impairing glucose metabolism and immune function, and substantially increasing the risk of injury due to motor vehicle crashes. In addition, it is likely that a significant proportion of mission controllers suffer from undiagnosed sleep disorders which will further impair their sleep and exacerbate fatigue. The deleterious effects of fatigue are readily observed in a wide range of safety -sensitive professions, including law enforcement officers, and include increased risk of self -injury, higher rates of fatigue - related motor vehicle accidents, and greater incidence of seriou s errors. The aim of the investigation is to assess a Comprehensive Police Fatigue Management Program for the flight mission controllers program. The goals of this program are to reduce the adverse consequences of fatigue on the mission controllers ' alertness, performance, health, and safety. The overall goals include developing an online education training program and an efficient sleep disorders screening, evaluating the acceptability, feasibility and efficacy of a shorter wavelength photic countermeasu re during operational night shifts and suggesting work- hour policies and guidelines that can be implemented to improve the alertness, performance, health and safety of mission controllers.

Risk Statement Mission architecture limits the amount of equipment, consumables, and procedures that will be available to treat medical problems. Mis sion allocation and technology development must be performed to ensure that the limited mass, volume, power, and crew training time are used efficiently to provide the broadest possible treatment capability. There is a risk that, given the resource limitat ions, some conditions may go untreated. Risk Context NPD 8900.3G (NASA Policy Directive: Astronaut Medical and Dental Observation Study and Care Program (Revalidated 2/27/08)) - The immediate and long -term responsibilities of NASA with regard to the human space flight program require that the Agency provide medical and dental care, observation, and study to astronauts, payload specialists, and other space flight participants while on active duty with NASA. This care, observation (to include health monitoring) and study will be provided, utilizing the best current guidelines for the clinical practice of medicine and dentistry, and will be comprehensive in scope as applicable to the NASA mission. It will encompass all aspects related to the mission, including certification and training, and will include all space flight mission phases (pre -, in-, and post -flight). Operational Relevance To address this broad risk, the ExMC has broken it down into seven categories that correspond with the seven requirements allocated to the ExMC from the HRP Program Requirements Document (PRD). Each of the seven categories is then analyzed individually to determine where gaps exist in satisfying the PRD requirements. Below are the seven categories into which the risk has been separated and an explanation of the strategy for addressing the different categories of gaps. Strategy for Addressing Risk and Gaps 1.0 Validate Standards: The NASA Headquarters Office of the Chief Health and Medical Officer (OCHMO) standard that pertain to this risk are Crew Selection and Retention Criteria. The Space Medicine Medical Operations Lead for standards, working with the ExMC Element Scientist, determines gaps in knowledge in the current Crew Selection and Retention Criteria. Tasks are then identified to close those knowledge gaps. 2.0 Quantify the Risk: Because of the limited available operational and research data, incidence rates and outcomes for relevant medical conditions have large uncertainties associated with them. The Space Medicine Exploration Conditio n List is analyzed to determine gaps in our knowledge about medical conditions' incidence rates and outcomes in spaceflight. Tasks are then assigned to further study, model and use analog population data to better quantify the medical conditions. 3.0 Mitig ate the Risk: Gaps in this section deal with our knowledge about effective training and telementoring programs for Exploration missions. The Space Medicine Medical Operations Lead for training, working with the ExMC Element Scientist, determines gaps in kn owledge and techniques for developing future crew, flight surgeon and biomedical ground controller training and telementoring programs. Tasks are then identified to close those knowledge gaps. HRP -47065 REV B 198 4.0 Monitor and Treat Each Condition: Based on the Space Medicine Exploration Condition List, each condition is analyzed for each exploration Design Reference Mission (DRM) for the capabilities required to monitor and treat the condition. An analysis is performed to determine where gaps exist in current technologies or where efficiencies could be realized in the future. Based on when a technology comes online, either a technology watch is implemented or a technology development project is initiated to deliver the technology to enable the mission. 5.0 Provide Enabling Capabilities: Provide data integration and management for HRP to ensure proper handling of data (e.g., Life Sciences Data Archive, Mission Extended Medical Enterprise). Gaps exist where these capabilities are either insufficient or incomplete. 6.0 Comply w ith Agency Standards: Follow best practices and programmatic guidelines as levied by the HRP PRD. There are currently no gaps associated with this requirement. 7.0 Reduce Resource Requirements: Wherever possible, reduce in -flight and funding resources. The re are currently no gaps associated with this requirement. NASA hardware development proceeds through several stages, with reviews occurring between the stages. Manned space flight programs go through these stages as it designs its next generation vehicles and space suits. Common reviews seen in the HRP documentation are: Hardware Development Process System Requirements Review (SRR): At the beginning of the project, establishes what the system will and will not do. Preliminary Design Review (PDR): At 10 % design completion, is primarily to critique the architecture of the design and critical decisions made in the design. Critical Design Review (CDR): At 90% design completion, is primarily to make a last set of changes before the design is finalized. To make sure that all the organizations within NASA and its associated contractors are working off the same set of plans, NASA uses a rigorous \"configuration management\" system to obtain, review and implement changes to key documents. A change is initiated by a formal document called a Change Request (CR). A Change Request solicits input from many stakeholders. That input is provided in the form of a Review Item Discrepancy (RID). A RID is essentially a request to change part of a document and includes the rat ionale. The owner of the document decides whether or not to make the change. The Human Research Program often provides RIDs to CRs concerning program level documents. This is the NASA process that allows HRP results to change NASA's plans for Orion, Altair , and/or Suit- 1. The objective of the Technology Watch Process (TWP) is to identify emerging, high- impact technologies that augment current Exploration Medical Capability development efforts and accelerate the development of medical care and research capabilities for the mitigation of potential health issues encountered during space exploration missions. The aim of this process is to leverage technologies developed by academia, industry and other government agencies and to identify the effective utilization of NASA resources to maximize HRP return on investment. The establishment of partnerships with these entities is beneficial to technology development, assessment and/or insertion and further NASA's goal to provide a safe and healthy environment for human exploration. Even if not directly noted on the IRP, technology watch is done on all gaps. Please reference the ExMC Element Plan for more details on the technology watch process. Technology Watch Process HRP -47065 REV B 199 The ExMC Element has identifi ed specific questions that need resolution in order to narrow or close its gaps. For a list of these, click on \"ExMC Gap Decomposition Spreadsheet\" available at: Gap Decomposition http://humanresearch.jsc.nas a.gov/elements/exmc.asp ExMC 1.01: Inadequate and/or immature information on medical screening technology for the identification of clinical and sub -clinical pathology for medical conditions experienced in space flight environments Gaps Description: This is an ongoing gap that the element will continually address. There are no plans to close this gap. Both genetic and phenotypic screening will be addressed by this gap. Relevant ExMC Medical Conditions include: TBD Task: Short Title: Science and technology watch for medical screening technology TW Screening Responsible Organization: ExMC Supporting Organization: N/A Funding Source: Directed Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Identification of technologies and the medical conditions for which additional preflight medical screening could have potential for identifyi ng pathologies .

Completed Tasks Data Mining/Identification of characteristics associated with susceptibility to hypobaric environments ExMC 2.01: Lack of knowledge about incidence rates, probabilities and consequences relative to Loss of Crew and/or Loss of Mission (LOC/LOM) for the medical conditions on the Exploration Medical Condition List Description: One of the major gaps of knowledge with space medicine is quantification of likelihood and consequence of medical conditions that could occur in spaceflight. Total combined duration of human spaceflight is brief and limited. So the body of medical evidence from which to quantify medical conditions is small when compared to terrestrial medicine body of evidence. HRP -47065 REV B 201 The focus of this gap is to generate a list of medical conditions that are of concern for human spaceflight, and provide quantifiable data and rationale backing why the medical condition is of concern. Task: Integrated Medical Model Short Title: IMM Responsible Organization: ExMC Supporting Organi zation: N/A Funding Source: Directed Other gaps supported by this task: N/A The Integrated Medical Model (IMM) is a decision support tool useful to mission planners and medical system designers in assessing risk and designing medical systems for specified space flight missions. The IMM provides an evidence -based approach to optimize medical resources and minimize risk within space flight operational constraints. The mathematical relationships among mission and crew profiles, medical condition incidence dat a, in-flight medical resources, potential crew functional impairments, and clinical end -states are established to determine probable mission outcomes. Stochastic computational methods are used to forecast probability distributions of crew health and medical resource utilization, as well as estimates of medical evacuation and loss of crew life. The IMM has been used in support of the International Space Station (ISS) medical kit re -design, the medical component of the ISS Probabilistic Risk Assessment, and t he development of the Space Medicine Exploration Medical Conditions List. The IMM will also be used to refine medical requirements for future exploration programs. Deliverables: Technology or Tool_Tools/Simulations Simulation and modeling tool Required Delivery Milestone: 9/30/2012 Required Platforms: Ground based # of Downmass supported by this task: N/A To enhance the IMM's capability to adequately forecast medical events of concern, where supporting information on the rate of occurrence is lacking, development of external simulation modules is used. The external modules integrate more complete knowledge of external and internal contributors to the event to estimate the rate of event occurrence during the exploration class missions simulated in the IMM. Conditions to be modeled require a higher level of fidelity and include those where insufficient space flight data is available and there is no clear correlation to a terrestrial analog. Additionally, medical events with multiple influencing factors, including gravitationally dependent physics, physiological changes during the mission, specific mission demands, vehicle limitations, crew reaction to critical events and interaction of these factors, can also be included in these models as deemed necessary to produce a simulation with adequate accuracy. The results of this analysis contribute significantly to the IMM's ability to forecast diagnoses and treatment outcomes of an ill or injured crewmember. Medical events to be modeled are selected based on the Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) Project identified gaps and prioritized through consensus of the IMM team (JSC, Wyle, GRC) with concurrence from the ExMC Element Manager and Element Scientist. The current task includes three specific subject areas: 1. Bone (Hip) Fracture during EVA 2. Sleep Disturbance requiring medical intervention 3. Renal stone formation Additional subject areas to be added in the future include: Head injury, stroke, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, chest injury, neck injury, abdominal injury. The diverse nature of the topic areas requires interaction with subject matter experts (SME) at JSC, NSBRI, and the external medical community. As part of this task, at least one SME is identified and consulted within each topic area throughout the development of the model to ensure that the most pertinent data is used in the simulation and that the simulation concept is acceptable to obtain the needed information. Although no direct depend ency on work in other projects exists, this modeling scheme does allow for integration of new information as it becomes available from these other projects such as Digital Astronaut. Deliverables: Technology or Tool_Tools/Simulations Data and software modules that are used by IMM software Required Delivery Milestone: N/A Required Platforms: Ground based # of Downmass 2.02: Lack of quantitative knowledge about impact of having a clinically trained crew medical officer on each space flight mission Description: It has not been quantified yet if inclusion of a physician crewmember with relevant competency maintained over the exploration mission would achieve better care/reduced risk, reduced cost, reduced training time, increased efficiency, reduced need for telementoring and increased autonomy. This gap aims to determine what effect a clinically trained crewmember would have on the overall cost and medical care quality. Task: Short Title: Quantify impacts of including various levels of clinical training within the crew Responsible Organization: ExMC Clinical CMO Supporting Organization: N/A Funding Source: Directed Other gaps supported by this task: N/A This task aims to determine the effects of having various levels of clinical training (doctor, nurse, EMT, surgeon, etc) within the crew's skill sets. An evaluation will be conducted to examine whether the skill le vel of the clinically trained crewmember will affect the supporting medical hardware, training, and procedures. Deliverables: Risk Characterization/Quantification_Evidence Final report describing impacts of including various levels of clinical training wi thin the crew Required Delivery Milestone: 3/15/2011 Required Platforms: Ground based # of Downmass Lack of knowledge about effectiveness of current NASA medical training programs including crewmember and ground support in diagnosing and treating medical conditions to the best possible outcome Description: Training of crewmembers and ground support teams is a critical component of a medical health care system. Providing medical hardware and technology is not enough when that equipment is not placed in the hands of a well trained and effective care provider. This gap seeks to explore the effectiveness of c urrent NASA medical training programs and document any inadequacies in those programs based on the many years of short and long duration manned space flight. HRP -47065 REV B 204 Task: This task is described under Risk of Error Due to Inadequate Information - Gap SHFE 3.1.1.b . Medical Proficiency Training Completed Task Data mining of post- flight medical crew debriefs for information on crewmember medical training effectiveness ExMC 3.02: Lack of knowledge about the current state of the art in telementoring/telemedicine a s a tool for assisting crewmembers to diagnose and treat medical conditions that occur in space flight Description: Telementoring is the delivery of training and mentoring services across telecommunication networks typically in the format of audio and vide o. As a subset modality of telemedicine, telementoring is focused on providing a means to train operators with the instructor physically located in a remote location. Based on the type of training content, the presentation format may vary. Various formats include teleconference, video conference, or web exchange. Due to the relative novelty of this form of communication, telementoring has only recently started to gain momentum as a means to guide and train remote operators. As such, effective means to communicate and techniques to convey information are constantly under development. This gap is focused on understanding the latest on telementoring technologies and techniques as well as media platforms on which the information is presented. Closure Crite ria: This gap will be closed when research and analysis on the current state of the art for telementoring/telemedicine is known. At that time, new gaps will open referring to specific medical conditions that will require telementoring/telemedicine. Task: Identify telementoring/telemedicine gaps Supporting Organization: N/A Directed Other gaps supported by this task: N/A A review of applicable medical conditions that require telementoring/telemedicine capability for diagnosis or treatment. Once identified, this will map against the current telementoring practices and condition -specific telementoring gaps will be developed. Deliverables: Risk Characterization/Qua ntification_Evidence Final report detailing the gap analysis conducted on telementoring/telemedicine practices necessary for space medicine on exploration missions HRP -47065 REV B 205 Required Delivery Milestone: 11/15/2010 Required Platforms: Ground based # of Downmass telementoring studies and practices ExMC 3.03: Inadequate means and methods for early recognition of in -flight medical conditions (including behavioral and functional) that can lead to higher consequence outcomes if not treated early Description: The prevention of medical conditions is the primary approach for having a healthy crew to perform a successful space flight mission. Periodic in -flight health status exams and routine crew monitoring are used in the early recognition of certain conditions on the Exploration Medical Condition List. By catching these conditions early, few resources can be used to treat the condition before the condition fully manifests into a potentially worst case scenario. This gap looks at all the various techniques and methods that can be used to monitor the crew and enable early recognition of medical conditio ns that could impact mission success. Closure Criteria: This gap will be closed when preventative measures to monitor and enable early recognition of Exploration Medical Condition List conditions have been evaluated and addressed. Task: Determine requirem ents for in- flight periodic health status exams based on Exploration Medical Condition List Short Title: In-flight PHS conditions Responsible Organization: ExMC Supporting Organization: N/A Source: Directed Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Human space flight inherently places humans in the hazardous environment of space. Monitoring their health status is critical in determining their overall well being and performance level thereby ensuring mission success. This task will develop the requ irements for routine health status exams that will monitor crew health in order to recognize or prevent certain conditions based on the Exploration Medical Condition List. HRP -47065 REV B 206 Deliverables: Requirements Requirements document baselined by a control board listi ng in- flight periodic health status exams needed for space flight Required Delivery Milestone: 6/30/2010 Required Platforms: Ground based # of Downmass N/A N/A Behavioral and functional under the following BHP and SHFH Gaps: BMed2 * What are the optimal methods to predict, detect, and assess decrements in behavioral health (which may negatively affe ct performance) before, during, and after spaceflight missions? BMed7 * What are the optimal methods for modifying the environment to prevent and remedy behavioral health problems during spaceflight missions? Gap PHYS-2: What tools can be used to evaluate habitability concepts for on- orbit and planetary missions? ExMC 4.01: Lack of autonomous medical procedure system that includes decision assistance and integrates with medical hardware including closed loop systems Description: The current spaceflight procedure system is a combination of both paper and electronic formats. The procedures themselves are developed and validated on the ground. The burden is placed on the crewmember to be able to collect, analyze, and interpret data to decide which procedure decision pathway to follow. This can be an issue with medical procedures as the crewmembers often are not clinicians. They are given minimal medical training often months prior to the start of their mission. This gap focuses on reducing the burden of medical data analysis and decision making on the crewmember. In addition, this system could be useful in supporting a physician crew medical officer and offering a secondary set of instruction or assistance for an augmented medical care giver. An autonomous medical procedure system would assist the crewmember in analyzing and interpreting the medical data collected so that the proper decision pathways are followed. Closure Criteria: Requirements and market survey of autonomous procedure system for each Exp loration design reference mission Relevant ExMC Medical Conditions include: All conditions HRP -47065 REV B 207 Task: Short Title: Advanced Integrated Clinical System - Guided Medical Procedure System Responsible Organization: ExMC AICS -Assisted Supporting Organization: N/A gaps supported by this task: N/A Due to the limited medical skills and training of the crew, techniques to help the crewmembers perform medical procedures will be required. This will reduce the time required to perform the pr ocedure, allow the crew to refresh their training skills during the mission, and provide the crew with audio and visual information to guide them through the procedure efficiently. This has the possibility to develop into a decision support system. This directed study will help form the requirements and solicitation for future competed efforts. Deliverables: Requirements_Vehicle; Technology or Tool_Systems Solutions/Prototype Hardware Requirements document for development of the procedure system. TRL 7 system providing medical procedures and guidance demonstration on ISS. Required Delivery Milestone: 6/23/2010; 9/30/2013 Required Platforms: Ground based and ISS Upmass Upmass : iRevive Supporting Organization: N/A supported by this task: N/A Astronauts on long -duration missions will not be able to return to earth for routine or emergency medical care. We propose to develop an integrated system that can function autonomously, yet communicate with earth to provide astronaut health assessment, maintenance and medical care. The system will be based on the integration of two existing medical platforms. iRevive, which is a semantically flexible, mobile electronic medical record, will serve as the primary interface between the patient and crew medical officer. The lightweight trauma module (LTM), which is a combination ventilator/critical care monitor and therapeutic system with integrated automatic control systems, will provide manifold physiological support functions. The integrated syst em will collect, monitor and fuse patient care information with physiological patient data to further study and optimize remote medical diagnosis, ventilatory support, IV fluid therapy and treatment options. The composite system will effectively guide the actions of the crew medical officer to help direct and manage therapeutic interventions. HRP -47065 REV B 208 Deliverables: Technology or Tool_Systems_Prototype Software TRL 6 system that integrates assisted medical procedures on the Lightweight Trauma Module platform Requir ed Delivery Milestone: 8/31/2011 Required Platforms: Ground based Downmass invasive diagnostic imaging capability and techniques to diagnose identified Exploration Medical Conditions involving internal body parts Description: Due to the normal constraints of spaceflight, most common clinical diagnostic techniques will not be available durin g exploration missions. That is especially true for imaging diagnostics. Although physicians commonly use X -rays, Computed Tomography scans (CT scans), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and other techniques, perhaps only ultrasound may be com patible with spaceflight. Flight surgeons have also requested improved imaging hardware operating in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum to acquire digital images of skin and body orifices. Work under this gap will initially focus on identifying spaceflight medical conditions where imaging -based diagnosis and/or treatment is required, developing an evidence base for determining which technologies are required, and assessing the spaceflight readiness of the identified technologies. Once the appropriate technologies are identified and readiness determined, the integration lead will develop a plan to not only integrate the technologies to the greatest extent possible, but also the groups working on those technologies. Those groups include GRC , JSC, and ARC, as well as the NSBRI. The integration lead will also identify relevant work being performed with non-NASA funding and leverage NASA work with those efforts. Closure Criteria: TRL 6 capability identified for each Exploration design referenc e mission based on relevant ExMC medical condition list Relevant ExMC Medical Conditions include: Back Pain / Injury; Chest Injury/Pneumothorax; Chest Pain/Angina; Constipation - SAS; Hypertension; Decompression Sickness; Dental - Cavity/Temporary Filling; Dental - Exposed Pulp ;Dental - Tooth Loss; Dental - Toothache; Dysfunctional Uterine Dislocation; Braslet Validation of on -Orbit Methodology for the Assessment of Cardiac Function and Changes in the Circulating Volume Using Ultrasound and Braslet- M Occlusion Cuffs, Station Detailed Technical Objective anization: Source: Directed Other gaps supported by this task: N/A The Validation of On -Orbit Methodology for the Assessment of Cardiac Function and Changes in the Circulating Volume Using Ultrasound and Braslet- M Occlusion Cuffs, SDTO 17011 (B raslet) is a collaborative effort between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Russian Federal Space Agency (FSA) for which each organization acts as a portion of the co -investigator team. The goal of this investigation is to establish a valid ultrasound methodology for assessing a number of aspects of central and peripheral hemodynamics and cardiovascular function, specifically in rapid changes in intravascular circulating volume. This SDTO will use Braslet- M occlusion cuffs, which are a Russian -made operational countermeasure already pre -calibrated and available onboard for each ISS crewmember. Braslet will use multiple modes of ultrasound imaging and measurements, in combination with short -term application of Braslet -M occlusive cuffs and cardiopulmonary maneuvers (Valsalva, Mueller) to demonstrate and to evaluate the degree of changes in the circulating volume on orbit. This will be accomplished by performing echocardiographic examinations in multiple modes (including Tissue Doppler mode), ultrasound measurements of lower extremity venous and arterial vascular responses to Braslet -M device under nominal conditions and also during cardiopulmonary Mueller and Valsalva maneuvers. Identical measurements will be repeated without Braslet - M, with Braslet -M applied, and immediately after releasing the occlusion device. In addition to the primary goal of methodology validation for cardiovascular evaluations (including those related to circulating volume changes and manipulations), operational ly relevant procedures will be developed to rule out a number of mission -impacting medical conditions. Space -adapted and non -invasive methodologies to study peripheral and central hemodynamics are a valid contribution of this investigation that can later be used to evaluate other countermeasures, as well as to diagnose or rule out arterial, venous, and cardiac pathology. The effect of prolonged weightlessness on venous capacitance or venous blood flow has not been effectively studied using ultrasound, and the protocols developed by this investigation could be used by other investigators for such purposes. The data gathering techniques for the volume status evaluation will be validated through assessment of Braslet -M application/release effects, and the use o f ultrasound will provide hitherto unobtainable data on the overall effects of Braslet- M as a countermeasure. This investigation will provide pilot data regarding the effect of occlusion cuffs on the cardiovascular system of long -duration crewmembers and reveal whether it can be used as a means of acute or chronic volume manipulation for medical purposes. This activity will also determine the on -orbit and ground resources needed to enable such research during future ISS increments until a full -scale evaluat ion of the Braslet -M device can be performed. This future work would specifically examine the Braslet -M effects on cardiovascular system physiology, its safety, utility, and potentially new or expanded uses. The results of the current, limited investigatio n will be used to optimize the pre -flight and in -flight training modules for subsequent expedition crews. The lessons learned from this investigation will be used to propose a more formal operationally relevant investigative protocol for future increments, which in turn will address the question regarding utility of Braslet -M for ISS and exploration- class missions. Deliverables: Risk Characterization/Quantification_Evidence Final report detailing effectiveness of Braslet countermeasure Required Delivery M ilestone: 9/30/2010 Required Platforms: ISS of Space Short Titl e: gaps supported by this task: N/A Crew members on long duration space missions are at significant risk of decreased strength of bones despite count er-measures. The radiographic capabilities of future spacecraft are unknown, however, ultrasound is currently operational on the ISS. Preliminary investigations have shown that ultrasound can reliably diagnose long bone fractures. This proposal will evalua te the accuracy of ultrasound in the diagnosis of bony fractures and develop just in time, training methods to allow astronauts to perform and interpret skeletal ultrasound to answer the specific aims: 1. Evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for bon y fractures and fracture healing in ground based studies. 2. Develop training programs to facilitate skeletal ultrasound to exclude fracture. 3. Develop pattern recognition algorithms to allow astronauts to autonomously diagnose skeletal fracture. Methods Speci fic Aim 1: The accuracy of ultrasound will be evaluated against X -ray in a large cohort of acutely injured patients at the Level 1 trauma center at Henry Ford Hospital. Ultrasound examinations will be performed by experts in parallel with astronaut equival ents on patients with a history and exam consistent with bony fracture to assess sensitivity and specificity and optimize technique. The randomized trials will include patient groups with probable long bone, axial skeletal, and hand/foot fractures to allow statistical conclusions about exam accuracy to be determined. : Specific Aim 2: A computer based ultrasound training program will be developed for astronauts to allow skeletal ultrasound to be performed for axial and extremity fractures based on a successful Onboard Proficiency Enhancement (OPE) program. Specific Aim 3: Autonomous ultrasound diagnostic capabilities will be developed for astronauts by combining cue card reference images, to pographic ultrasound guides, and normal/anticipated pathologic images to allow pattern recognition diagnosis by the operators.

Terrestrial investigations suggest expanded clinical applications of ultrasound which could be used to diagnose over 75% of space medical conditions. This proposal will use an outcomes oriented approach to develop an intuitive ultrasound image catalog, coupled with just -in-time training methods, to allow non -experts to acquire and interpret advanced ultrasound examinations. Specific Aim 1: Develop an intuitive ultrasound image cataloging system which incorpo rates ground acquired ultrasound whole body images. The catalog will acquire ground based crew -member images to use for medical diagnosis in space. Specific Aim 2: A mathematical coupling model will be developed based on existing ground/in -flight ultrasoun d data which will allow microgravity associated morphometric and topographic changes to be predicted. Specific Aim 3: Assess the ability of non -physician crew medical officers (CMO) analogs to acquire and interpret complex ultrasound examinations autonomously or with remote guidance. The constraints of spaceflight require the development of novel strategies for crew member health problems including ultrasound. Evidence based trials have demonstrated the accuracy of ultrasound in aerospace relevant clinical conditions when performed and interpreted by experts. ISS experiments have shown that just -in-time trained astronaut crew -members, augmented by on -board proficiency enhancement, can acquire complex, diagnostic quality ultrasound images. Expanding just- in-time ultrasound training to autonomous ultrasound operation, coupled with enhanced on -site interpretative capabilities, significantly expands diagnostic capabilities during exploratory class space missions. The majority of the training algorithms in this proposal a re readily transferable to terrestrial medicine and provide a significant, clinically relevant advance in space medical capabilities with profound Earth - based ramifications.

Osteoporosis will diminish both the structure and strength of bone, each considered critical in defining the ability of the bone to resist fracture. Early diagnosis of such progressive bone loss would allow prompt treatment, and thus inherently reduce the risk of fracture. Bone mineral density (BMD) measurement is a well -accepted, standard assessment used for the diagnosis of osteopenia and osteoporosis, using dual-energy X -ray Absorptiometry (DXA) in the clinic. However, it is limited to a BMD index and insensitive to bone's physical properties. Advents in quantitative ultrasound (QUS) techniques can characterize both BMD and the material properties. Using a newly developed noninvasive Scanning Confoca l Acoustic Diagnostic (SCAD) technology, strong correlations between SCAD determined data and bones structural and strength parameters were observed. Ultrasound has also been shown therapeutic potentials to accelerate fracture healing. The objectives of th is study are to develop a combined diagnostic and treatment ultrasound technology for early prediction of bone disorder and guided acceleration of fracture healing, using SCAD imaging and low -intensity pulse ultrasound. The technology will target to the critical skeletal sites, where may be significantly affected by disuse osteopenia and potentially at the risk of fracture, i.e., hip, long bone and wrist regions. We will evaluate bone's quality in clinical human subjects, and at the JSC/UTMB bedrest facilit y. Animal models and cadaver will be used for testing feasibility of identifying bone loss, fracture, and longitudinally treatment and monitoring. A noninvasive diagnostic and treatment technology using ultrasound will have significant potentials to prevent and treat bone fracture, and will address critical questions in the HRP Bioastronautics Roadmap related to bone loss monitoring, prevention and recovery. In this year's research, the research team is continuing in development of a new generation of the prototype of scanning confocal acoustic navigation (SCAN) system to access the bone quality at the multiple skeletal sites, and use ultrasound to detect bone fracture. A combined mechanical and electrical array scan modality has been initiated, which can co mplete the SCAN time at the particular skeletal site less than 2.5 minutes. The new development is capable of generating non -invasive, high- resolution quantitative ultrasound (QUS) attenuation and velocity maps of bone for determining the relationship betw een ultrasonic specific parameters and bone mineral density (BMD) and bone's physical properties (i.e., stiffness). Several studies were conducted. 1. Multi -Site Quantitative Ultrasound Scanner for Osteoporosis Diagnostics - Evaluated at the Distal Radius. The objective of this study was to provide validation of the new mechanical setup for the 2D scanning confocal acoustic diagnostic (SCAD) system, and evaluate its performance at the distal radius. 2. Non-invasive assessment of long bone fracture and its potenti al healing process using quantitative ultrasound. HRP -47065 REV B 214 In this study, we evaluated a hypothesis that the ultrasonic velocity drop is dependent on the fracture gap size. A three transducers ultrasound system was setup to measure fracture gap size. This was verif ied by both experiment and mathematical simulation. 3. Mediation of Bone Loss with Ultrasound Induced Dynamic Mechanical Signals in an OVX Rat Model of Osteopenia. This study tests the hypothesis that an ultrasound generated dynamic mechanical signal can inhibit bone loss in an estrogen deficient model of osteopenia.

The type of injury will most likely be mild to moderate ligament or muscle strains. Relevant ExMC Medical Conditions include: Back Pain / Injury; Neck Injury Task: This task is described under Risk of Intervertebral Disk Damage - Gap B4 IVD ExMC 4.04: Lack of smart hardware for ventilation with variable oxygenation capability that mitigates localized oxygen build up Description: The proper and adequate operation of a ventilation device and variable oxygen delivery is a skill that takes many hours of training. The Crew Medical Officers (CMO) on exp loration missions will more than likely be given very limited medical training overall and even more limited training on ventilation and variable oxygen delivery. The training opportunities to teach the CMO on how to operate a ventilator will not be adequate enough to provide terrestrial standard of care during a medical contingency. The purpose of this gap is to develop hardware that can assist the caregiver in decision support involved with operating a ventilator and variable oxygen delivery device. Carbon dioxide monitoring capabilities may also be investigated in this gap should relevant medical conditions call for CO 2 regulation. The HRP -47065 REV B 215 entire smart system will also need to minimize volume, mass, and power consumption. Developing a smart hardware system reduces the cognitive burden on the CMO to operate the ventilator, thereby reducing the risk of an inadequately trained operator. The smart hardware can manage the ventilation of the patient while the CMO can be freed to perform other medical tasks. T his also allows CMO training to focus their limited resources on other aspects of their CMO training for tasks that technology cannot overcome. Closure Criteria: TRL 8 system identified for exploration missions Relevant ExMC Medical Conditions include: Smoke Inhalation; Sudden Cardiac Toxic Trauma Module Title: Organization: CHeCS HMS Supporting Organization: ExMC Directed Other gaps supported by this task: N/A There has been an ongoing partnership with military and industry stakeholders to develop autonomous medical capabilities. Advanced Integrated Clinical System (AICS) projects have included the Lightweight Trauma Module (LTM) and O 2 concentrator requirements research. The US Army is expected to provide the funding needed by the start of FY2008 to complete the development of a deployable version of the LTM with the delivery of test articles for functional and airworthiness certification the following year. In parallel, the submission to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for 510K clearance for the device and the requirements development and design for a version to support the ISS will also be completed. Deliverables: Technology or Tool_Prototype Hardware Flight ready ventilation and critical care monitoring capability Required Delivery Milestone: 9/30/11 Required Platforms: Ground based # of Downmass Pressure Swing Adsorption Technology for Spaceflight gaps supported by this task: N/A A source of medical oxygen will be needed at some point to keep an astronaut alive during a space mission. To meet this need, the ideal oxygen source would be a light, compact unit that use s minimal electricity and can supply oxygen continuously for many days. No current technology meets these requirements. Traditional compressed -oxygen cylinders provide a limited amount of oxygen in a heavy, inconvenient package and are not suited for space missions. Oxygen concentrators, which extract oxygen from air using electricity, can eliminate the obvious problems with cylinder storage in space. These kinds of medical oxygen concentrators are already used in residential and military applications. How ever, existing systems are too big, use too much power, and are too heavy to be carried into space. For example, a unit that can produce oxygen continuously at 4 liters per minute (LPM), weigh less than 7 pounds and use less than 100 watts of electric powe r requires a two -fold reduction in weight and power consumption, compared with the most advanced oxygen concentrators now in production by SeQual Technologies. However, as proposed in this project, this requirement may be met by combining new air compressor designs with advances in Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) technology. SeQual and researchers from the University of South Carolina, Vanderbilt University and the Marshall Space Flight Center are uniquely positioned to achieve this next level of performance. To determine whether this is possible, the research team will carry out an extensive mathematical modeling study of the physical system using computer simulation, coupled with breadboard system design and testing. It is anticipated that this project wil l identify approaches to improve the efficiency of the PSA separation and thus culminate in a breadboard system that will supply 4 LPM of oxygen, weigh 7.2 pounds and require 106 watts of electric power.

This project is a continuation of a related project entitled \"Handheld Body -Fluid Analysis System for Astronaut Health Monitoring,\" in which we explored electrical impedance se nsing, fluorescence optical sensing, and flow separation of blood cells in microfluidic devices and portable platforms. We successfully demonstrated fluorescent sensing and counting for WBC count and 2- part differential with a portable prototype micro flow cytometer. For the current project, a major effort is proposed to extend the 2 -part WBC differential to a 5 -part WBC differential, add cell surface marker detection and analysis capability to the platform repertoire, and add plasma protein detection and a nalysis capability to the platform repertoire. Our approach to achieve the objectives is to extend the capability of the micro flow cytometer to enable a more comprehensive WBC differential, and allow detection of fluorescent labels attached to ligands use d for cell surface marker and plasma protein detection. The second component necessary for extending the platform capability is the offline data analysis software. This software is being developed in Matlab to facilitate both quantitative assessment of flu orescence detection and cell and analyte recognition and quantification. In the last funded year, we successfully tested the proposed micro flow cytometer in a zero -G parabolic flight test in collaboration with research scientists from Wyle cooperation. The test demonstrated the facility of doing WBC differential count in zero/micro gravity environment with the proposed prototype. Results similar to on -ground test are obtained. The prototype was shown to be convenient for operation. One flight crew learned to operate the prototype and carried out the test after a brief training. For improving the differential capability of the prototype, we worked on searching for new staining method and optimizing the previously proposed Acridine Orange staining. We success fully demonstrated 4 -part WBC HRP -47065 REV B 222 differential count (i.e. Lymphocyte, Monocyte, Neutrophil and Eosinophil) with a two color laser -induced fluorescence (LIF) detection scheme. The dye combination FITC and PI stains WBC in blood with selective affinity and show s different fluorescence signatures for each of the 4 types. The differential capability of the platform is largely improved from 2- part differential (i.e. Lymphocyte, Non -Lymphocyte) to 4- part differential (i.e. Lymphocyte, Monocyte, Neutrophil and Eosinophil). The previously proposed fast staining with Acridine Orange was also optimized so that the differential capability was expanded from 2- part to 3 -part (Lymphocyte, Monocyte and Neutrophil). We also worked on improving the proposed platform on its exci tation source. By replacing the LED with a laser excitation, the induced fluorescence intensity is largely enhanced. With the improved prototype, WBC subtype counting such as CD4+ T cells with fluorophore conjugated antibody staining whole blood was also demonstrated. The sensitivity of the improved prototype was capable to detect fluorescence signals from the fluorophore after the conjugated antibody adhering to the cell surface, which provided a useful method of approaching out specific aim for WBC subtyp e analysis. To analyze WBC subtypes, we proposed to use continuous flow separation at upstream and dielectric properties characterization at downstream. Our previous design had achieved a very compact design capable of continuous cell separation. The geometry of the sorting region has been further optimized to improve sorting efficiency and enhance continuous operation. Experiments have been performed to successfully separate particles and embryoid bodies into size-dependant groups. Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is explored for dielectric properties characterization which employed a microelectrode array in combination of a novel cell patterning method for cell impedance measurements on the single -cell basis. Utilizing photolithographically patterne d SAMs and stepwise protein immobilization enable the precise formation of single -cell arrays. Target cells are immobilized onto detection electrodes and their impedance spectra are measured to discriminate different WBC subtypes. For the coming year, we p lan to work on improving the platform on its detection part. To expand the detecting spectrum range, we plan to explore of using mini spectrometer on the micro flow cytometer platform instead of the PMT detectors. Spectrum analysis could provide the potential of analyzing multi -color fluorescence in a compact size prototype. Further, we will explore WBC counting and differential with fluorophore conjugated antibodies. A cocktail of fluorescent dyes including acridine orange will be investigated to stain blo od for five part WBC differential, also for WBC subtype counting. For WBC subtype separation and counting, with the successful optimization of the continuous flow separation device, integration of micromixer and deionier as well as DEP focusing devices and Coulter counters will be investigated. The fluorescent particle immunoassay (FPIA) will be investigated for on -chip plasma protein detection.

It is unclear whether this bone mineral density will stabilize at a lower level, or continue to diminish. It is also unknown if fractional gravity, present on the HRP -47065 REV B 223 moon and Mars would mitigate the loss. This level of bone loss does not create an unacceptable risk of fractures for ISS missions, but longer missions could create higher fracture risk (excerpt from the IRP). Current casting methods are problematic for the anticipated operational environment during lunar mission sorties and long duration stays. Modifying existing casting methods or identifying a new technology for ca sting will be essential to meet this gap.

Additionally, several conditions may require intravenous fluid to maintain hydration and electrolyte balance. Because of the volume and mass that would be required to treat all conditions specified, NASA prefers to generate sterile water for injection in situ on an ad hoc basis.

IntraVenous Fluid GENeration for Exploration Missions (IVGEN) will demonstrate a microgravity compatible water purification to the standards required for intravenous administration, and a pharmaceutical mixing system. This hardware is a prototype that will allow flight surgeons more options to treat ill or injured crewmembers during future long -duration exploration missions. Trade studies were used to down- select diff erent technologies based on minimizing mass, volume, and power requirements.

Furthermore, by pre -positioning a sterile magnetic stir bar and salt within an IV bag, the desired medical solution can be quickly and effectively generated. Given the limitations with both the normal gravity and ground -based reduced gravity testing, these results need to be verified on orbit using a protot ype. Further, an appropriate system level test should be conducted prior to deployment.

Significant astronaut activity will be conducted in a spacesuit or EVA (extravehicular activity) suit. The suit becomes the astronaut's personal habitat, supplying O 2, removing CO 2, and maintaining appropriate temperature. During lunar surface exploration, the astronauts must have continuous real -time feedback to assure that all consumables (O 2, cooling water, power) last until they can return safely to their quarters. The consumption rate of these resources depends upon the metabolic rate of the astronaut during EVA tasks and the suit's ability to manage thermal loads. This project will develop novel algorithms for our existing near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) platform for real -time assessment of metabolic rate (measured as the rate of oxygen consumption, VO 2) and muscle temperature. This capability is intended to be incorporated into biosensors which will be part of a smart system to advise astronauts about their usage of consumables during lunar surface activities. The following specific aims were proposed: 1. Develop and validate algorithms to accurately calculate VO 2 from NIR spectra collected from muscle 2. Develop and validate algorithms to simultaneously calculate muscle temperat ure 3. Support incorporation of the sensor algorithms into the EVA suit testing program, where practical We have demonstrated the feasibility determining VO 2 with the Fick equation and data that can be collected solely through a NIRS system. The accuracy of t his technique is currently limited at high exercise intensities, primarily due to inaccuracies in our stroke volume estimate. We have initiated human studies that will allow us to improve our ability to estimate stroke volume and increase the accuracy of HRP -47065 REV B 237 our VO 2 calculation. The goal for this project is the demonstration of decreased VO 2 as a result of deconditioning (bed rest). With synergistic funds from the US Army Medical Research Command and an additional small grant from NSBRI we have designed and demonstrated a completely solid-state (non fiber based) sensor. This sensor runs off a small battery pack and a handheld computer. A sophisticated user interface performs automated system set-up and on-the -fly error checking to optimize data quality in the face of changing blood flow. After laboratory evaluation in the JSC Cardiovascular Lab, the system will be available for in-suit testing by the EVA Physiology project.

The deposition of particles in the lung is strongly influenced by gravitational sedimentation. Studie s by our group have shown that normal gravity provides a screening effect whereby inhaled PM larger than 0.5 micron is mainly deposited in the larger airways where it is cleared by mucociliary clearance transport within ~one day. However in low-gravity, su ch as that on the surface of the Moon (~1/6G) and Mars (~3/8G), this protective 'gravitational screening' is less efficient, and as a result particles are deposited in the sensitive alveolar regions of the lung where residence times are very much longer. F urther, there is evidence that the dust present on the surface of the Moon may possess potent toxicological properties. We hypothesize that clearance rates from the lung of particles deposited in low -gravity will be substantially reduced compared to that in 1G, resulting in increased residence times of these particles in the periphery of the lung, enhancing their potential to cause lung damage. In order to test this hypothesis we propose to measure the clearance rates (measured in 1G) over a few hours to ~1 -2 days, of radio-labeled particles deposited in healthy humans both in 1G and in low - gravity corresponding to the lunar surface (~1/6G) during parabolic flight. These data will provide a : HRP -47065 REV B 246 comprehensive assessment of alterations in the clearance rate of par ticles inhaled under normal 1G conditions compared to particles inhaled under conditions of lunar gravity (1/6G). Such an assessment is needed to determine the degree of effort and cost required to control lunar dust within a planned lunar outpost. Key Fin dings In this first year we have been exclusively engaged in technical work, and as such there are no scientific results yet available. In addition to the necessary technical accommodation work required to fly the gamma camera in the Reduced Gravity Aircr aft, we have utilized existing flights (those funded by NSBRI under TD -00701) to verify the following technical objectives by flying small elements of hardware at no additional cost: : \u00b7 Verified the functionality of two aerosol generation systems (on for each size range planned to be studied) under zero -gravity conditions. Both systems worked well. \u00b7 Measured the aerosol droplet size under flight conditions in the Reduced Gravity Aircraft to account for change in cabin pressure, g-level, and humidity. Verified only a minor influence of the flight environment compare to ground studies. Impact of Recent Findings The ability of both aerosol generators to work adequately in reduced gravity, and the altered flight environment (especially reduced cabin pressure) is important. These tests verify aspect of our experiment design and confirm that control data to be collected on the ground will be directly comparable to those collected in flight. : Year 2 Plan By the completion of year 1 we expect to have largely fabricated the flight system. The beginning of year 2 will comprise ground-based tests of the actual flight system to verify functionality both in terms of standard function and in terms of usability in flight. These tests will occur at the University of North Carolina (Dr Bennett). Later in year 2 we plan the first flight studies using 4 micron particles (we will start with the larger particle size as this will provide the higher activity scans). Flight dates are currently subject to negotiation with NASA although we are hopeful of the first flights occurring in the second half for CY 2009. : Deliverables: Risk Characterization/Quantification_Evidence Final report detailing particle depositing within the lungs in low gravity Required Delivery Milestone: 5/31/2012 Required Platforms: Ground based # of Lack of medical data management infrastructure for Explorati on Missions Description: In spaceflight, there is a large amount of data generated to understand and monitor the health and safety of the crewmember.

In general, nutritional risks increase with duration of exposure to a closed (or semi -closed) food system, and when countermeasures are employed. Understanding nutrient requirements in micro - or partial gravity environments and the effect of countermeasures on nutrient requirements is critical to ensure crew health and safety and mission success. Provision of these nutrients in safe amounts (neither high nor low) depends on provision of appropriate, palatable, foods with the stability of nutrients for the duration of the mission, and actual intake of the nutrients, and knowledge that countermeasures are not altering requirements. Risk Context It is critical that crewmembers be adequately nourished before and during missions. Critical research areas within this risk include validation of the correct nutritional need s; assessment of the stability of nutrients during long duration flight; correct packaging and preservation techniques; effects of countermeasures on nutrition; and use of nutrients as countermeasures. Operational Relevance Space normal must be defined for this risk; hence, the Nutrition Supplemental Medical Objective (SMO) is ongoing. Once space normal is defined, the data will be presented to the Human System Risk Forum and it will be decided if countermeasures need to be developed. In addition, several studies are ongoing to determine the optimal dose of vitamin D. Strategy for Mitigation N1: Are nutrients in food stable during space flight? This gap and all the tasks associated with it are being filled by AFT within SHFH; please refer to the Risk of Inadequate Food Sy stem, Gap AFT2 for further information. Gaps N2: What is the adequate dose range of vitamin D supplementation? It is unknown if the current vitamin D dosage is optimized, further work needs to be completed. HRP -47065 REV B 277 Task : Efficacy of Vitamin D Supplementation in an Ant arctic Ground Analog of Space Flight Short Title : Polar VitD Responsible Organization : HHC/NxPCM Supporting Organization : N/A Funding Source : Directed Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Persons with limited exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, includ ing space travelers, may not receive enough vitamin D. Recent studies indicate that optimal serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH vit D) should be 80 nmol/L. This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of 3 doses of vitamin D to raise and maintain 2 5- OH vit D to a concentration > 80 nmol/L in persons with limited UVB exposure. This was a 5 -month prospective, randomized, double -blinded study of vitamin D supplementation. It was conducted during winter in Antarctica at McMurdo Station, when UVB radiati on levels are essentially zero. The 55 subjects were randomly divided into 3 groups for vitamin D supplementation: 2000 IU/d ( n = 18), 1000 IU/d ( n = 19), and 400 IU/d ( n = 18). An additional 7 subjects did not take supplements or took ones of their own ch oosing. Blood samples were collected about every 2 mo during the winter. About 5 mo after supplementation started, 25- OH vit D increased to 71 \u00b1 23 nmol/L in the 2000-IU/d group, 63 \u00b1 25 nmol/L in the 1000- IU/d group, and 57 \u00b1 15 nmol/L in the 400 -IU/d group. It decreased to 34 \u00b1 12 nmol/L in the group not taking supplements. These data will enable us to provide space crews with evidence- based recommendations for vitamin D supplementation. The findings also have implications for other persons with limited U V light exposure, including polar workers and the elderly. The specific aims of this evaluation were: 1. Determine the time course and magnitude of changes in vitamin D status during wintering over in Antarctica, with or without vitamin D supplementation. 2. Determine other markers of bone and calcium metabolism (such as serum calcium, 1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D binding protein) before and after vitamin D supplementation to determine the effectiveness of supplementation. Deliverables : Risk Characterization _Evidence; Countermeasures _ Prescription Initial product is ground -based study to determine optimal vitamin D dosing. Required Delivery Milestone: No delivery milestone is required for this task. Required Platforms : Groun d-based models with limited sunlight exposure are necessary for evaluating vitamin D supplementation efficacy.

HRP -47065 REV B 278 Task : Vitamin D Supplem entation in an Antarctic Ground Analog of Space Flight: Study of Supplementation Protocol and Relationship to Immune System Function Short Title : Polar VitDII Responsible Organization : HHC/NxPCM Supporting Organization : N/A Funding Source : Directed Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Vitamin D is critical for space travelers because they lack ultraviolet light exposure and have an insufficient dietary supply of vitamin D. Despite the provision of vitamin D supplements to International Space Station ( ISS) crew members, vitamin D status is consistently lower after flight than before flight, and in several crew members has decreased to levels considered clinically significant. Vitamin D has long been known to play a role in calcium metabolism, and more recently its non -calcitropic functions have been recognized, such as its role in immune function. According to the results of several recent studies, functionally relevant measures indicate that the lower limit of serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (a marker of vitamin D status) should be raised from the current 23 nmol/L to 80 nmol/L. The mean preflight serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D for U.S. ISS crew members to date is 63 \u00b1 16 nmol/L, and after a 4- to 6-mo space flight it typically decreases 25 -30% despite supplemen tation (400 IU/d). The sub -optimal pre - and postflight vitamin D status is an issue that needs to be addressed, to allow NASA to better define the appropriate amount of supplemental vitamin D to serve as a countermeasure against vitamin D deficiency in as tronaut crews. This is very important for long -duration crew members, and is critical for exploration- class missions. We recently completed a ground -based investigation evaluating vitamin D supplementation efficacy during the winter months in Antarctic a, when UV- B radiation levels are zero. 2000 IU/d sufficiently raised serum 25 - hydroxyvitamin D to acceptable levels, but compliance was an issue that needs to be overcome. In this proposed study, we will investigate whether a weekly dose of 10000 IU vi tamin D could possibly be substituted for this daily 2000 IU dose, and we will investigate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on immune function in an environment known to suppress immune function. The proposed ground analog study will enable us to provide long-duration space flight crew members with evidence -based vitamin D supplement recommendations for optimal vitamin D status before, during, and after flight. 1.

Determine the relationships between vitamin D status and immune response. A polymerase chain reaction assay will be used to determine the reactivation patterns of varicella- zoster viru s, a causative agent chickenpox in children and shingles in adults. Salivary cortisol, a stress hormone, will also be quantified.

In this study, we will investigate whether a weekly or monthly dose of vitamin D could be substituted for a daily dose. Data from this study will help us to provide long -duration space flight crewmembers a safe, eff ective, and evidence- based recommendation for vitamin D supplementation to achieve and maintain optimal vitamin D status before, during, and after flight. The specific aims of this evaluation are: 1. Determine the time course and magnitude of changes in vita min D and vitamin D metabolite status with each dose of vitamin D supplementation. We will also determine markers of calcium and liver enzyme status to document potential side effects. 2. Determine other markers of bone and calcium metabolism (including ser um and urinary calcium, bone -specific alkaline phosphatase, 1,25 -dihydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D binding protein) and vitamin D metabolites over a 4 -month course of vitamin D supplementation, to determine the effectiveness and safety of each level of supplementation.

HRP -47065 REV B 280 Task : Short Title : Nutrition Status Assessment - SMO O16E Responsible Organization : HHC/NxPCM Nutrition SMO Supporting Organization : N/A Funding Source : Directed Other gaps supported by this task: N6, N15, N7 The Clinical Nutritional Assessment profile (MR016L) has been implemented with two Mir and all ISS US crewmembers. The MR016L protocol nominally consists of 2 pre -flight and one post -flight analysis of nutritional status. This proposal seeks to expand the MR016L testing in 3 ways: 1) include inflight blood and urine collection, 2) expand nominal testing to include makers of normative markers of nutritional assessment, and 3) add an R+30 session to allow evaluation of postflight nutrition and implications for rehabilitation. Nutrition SMO To date, it has not been possible to assess nutritional status during flight because blood and urine could not be collected/returned during ISS missions. The altere d nutritional status findings for several nutrients post flight are of concern, and we require the ability to monitor the status of these nutrients during flight to determine if there is a specific impetus or timeframe for these decrements. In addition to monitoring crew nutritional status during flight, in -flight sample collection would allow for better assessment of countermeasure effectiveness. This protocol is also designed to expand the current MR016L to include additional normative markers for assessing crew health and countermeasure effectiveness, and extend the current protocol to include an additional post -flight blood and urine collection (R+30). Several nutritional assessment parameters are altered at landing, but it is not known whether the changes are still apparent after 30 days. Additional markers of bone metabolism (helical peptide, OPG, RANKL, IGF -1) will be measured to better monitor bone health and countermeasure efficacy. New markers of oxidative damage will be measured (8 - iso-prosta glandin F2a, protein carbonyls, oxidized and reduced glutathione) to better assess the type of oxidative insults during space flight. The array of nutritional assessment parameters will be expanded to include serum folate, plasma pyridoxal 5'- phosphate, a nd homocysteine to better understand changes in folate, vitamin B 6 status, and related cardiovascular risk factors during and after flight. Additionally, stress hormones and hormones that affect bone and muscle metabolism will be also measured (DHEA, DHEA- S, cortisol, testosterone, estradiol). This additional assessment would allow for better health monitoring, and allow for more accurate recommendations to be made for crew rehabilitation. These additional parameters were added due to the recommendation of an extramural panel that met to define nutritional standards and requirements in 2005. Deliverables : Risk Characterization _Evidence; Countermeasures _Prescription The SFHSS nutrition standard will be updated and nutritional requirements will be del ivered to AFT.

Task : Dietary intake can predict and protect against changes in bone metabolism during space flight and recovery Short Title : Pro-K Responsible Organization : Supporting Organization : N/A HHC/NxPCM Funding Source : Solicited Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Bone loss is not only a well -documented effect of spacefl ight on astronauts, but also a condition that affects millions of men and women on Earth each year. Many countermeasures to bone loss have been proposed, and many have been evaluated to some degree. To date, those showing potential have focused on either e xercise or pharmacological interventions, but none have specifically investigated dietary intake alone as a factor to predict or minimize bone loss during spaceflight. We propose to document how the ratio of acid to base precursors in the diet is related t o directional changes in markers of bone resorption and formation during flight and recovery from flight. There is a high likelihood for success in predicting the extent of bone loss from dietary intake patterns of astronauts during spaceflight, given that this concept is strongly anchored in previous ground -based data from our laboratory and others. The notion of manipulating diet to minimize bone loss could also have significant social and economic impacts for NASA and for the general public - especially given the increasing trends for diets that are high in animal protein and low in fruits and vegetables. The proposed experiments will result in a dietary countermeasure for bone loss that has no associated risks for side effects, no requirement for payload mass, and no additional crew time necessary during flight. 1) To determine if the ratio of acid (animal protein) to base (potassium) precursors in the diet is correlated with markers of bone formation and bone res orption during spaceflight. Specifically, this aim will be addressed by controlling the ratio of animal protein to potassium intake during short -duration spaceflight. The specific aims of this evaluation are: 2) To determine the influence of urinary calcium excretion on the predictability of changes in bone metabolism from acid and base precursors in the diet. 3) To determine if the ratio of acid to base precursors in the diet is related to length of time required for recovery from bone mineral loss after spaceflight. This aim will be addressed during recovery from long-duration spaceflight.

Nutrition Status Assessment - SMO O16E Task: NEEMO Rapid Operational Investigation (ROI) study: Characterization of Oxidative Damage during a 12 - day Saturation Dive Short Title: NEEMO Nutrition ROI Responsible Organization: HCC/NxPCM Supporting Organization: N/A Source: Directed Other gaps supported by this task: N6 The NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) underwater habitat is a useful spaceflight analog. However, the increased air pres sure in the habitat exposes crewmembers to higher oxygen pressures, which increase their risk for oxidative damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids. Studies from a previous NEEMO mission suggested that DNA oxidation occurs at an increased level, similar to tha t observed in smokers and astronauts returning from space. Astronauts in space and NEEMO crewmembers also have similar changes in iron metabolism. Newly formed red blood cells are destroyed and body iron stores are elevated. Since excess iron can act as an oxidant and cause tissue damage, we investigated aspects of oxidative damage and tested whether toxic forms of iron were present when iron stores increased during NEEMO missions. Subjects (n = 12) participated in 10- to 12 -d saturation dives, and blood and 24 -h urine samples were collected twice before, twice during, and twice after the dive. During the dive, ferritin was higher (P < 0.001), transferrin was lower (P < 0.001), and transferrin receptors were lower (P < 0.01). Serum iron was higher during and immediately after the dive (P < 0.001). Total homocysteine and superoxide dismutase activity were affected by time (P < 0.001, P < 0.05); homocysteine increased during the dive and superoxide dismutase decreased during and after the dive. Labile plasma ir on was measurable only during the dive. These data indicate that the NEEMO environment increases body iron stores and labile forms of iron, which may contribute to oxidative damage. The specific aims of this evaluation were to: 1. To measure free and bound i ron pools to better understand the changes in iron storage during NEEMO missions. 2. To expand biomarkers of oxidative damage to better understand the type of oxidative damage in an oxidative environment such as NEEMO.

Additionally, markers of folate status and metabolism will be evaluated, given that these were affected in earlier NEEMO and ISS crewmembers, though a mechanism that may relate to oxidative insult. Measurements will also include markers to determine whether the increase in body iron storage during NEEMO missions is due to destruction of red blood cells, which would be a similar mechanism to what happens during spaceflight. We expect that there is neocytolysis upon exposur e to the increase in pressure based on numerous altitude studies; however, there have not been any direct measurements of this in the NEEMO model. Specific Aims: 3. To expand measurements of oxidative damage to include more markers to better characterize the type of damage. Some examples include gammmaH2AX and HMGB1, which are early event markers for tissue injury and inflammation and have broad application. 4. To measure markers of hemolysis (haptoglobin and hemopexin) to better understand the increase in iron storage during NEEMO missions. 5. To measure markers of folate status to better understand the effect of an oxidative stress on folate metabolism.

Risk Statement The Factor of Risk [FOR] for fracture (\"Risk of Bone Fracture\") is defined as the ratio between the Applied Force vector to bone and the Fracture Load of bone (vector is used here to indicate that both magnitude and direction of load are critical). Bone fracture load is a reflection of bone strength, but bone fracture load cannot be measured directly without being destructive. A long-established surrogate measure for whole bone strength has been the DX A measurement of areal bone mineral density [aBMD]. By this measure, skeletal adaptation to microgravity in LD astronauts has been characterized by a ~ 1-2% decline in aBMD per month for normally weight -bearing bones. This rate is an averaged monthly BMD loss that has been determined over LD missions of 4-6 month duration. This level of BMD loss does not create an unacceptable risk of fractures during ISS missions since the Applied Loads are also reduced in the weightlessness of low Earth orbit. It is uncl ear whether DXA BMD loss will stabilize at a lower level or continue to diminish beyond 6 months. Thus, the total loss in BMD could be greater with longer missions and consequently longer missions could increase the FOR. It is also unknown if fractional gravity, present on the moon and Mars would mitigate the loss . Taken together, it is possible for astronauts, after 6 months of deconditioning, to have an increased FOR for at least one skeletal site in an environment with reduced g forces. The FOR for a given mission architecture cannot be accurately estimated until the time course of skeletal adaptations (which influences bone strength) and the knowledge of mission activities (which influence applied loads) are identified. With this knowledge, the proba bilities of bone overloading during the missions can be assessed. Greater understanding of skeletal adaptation to microgravity is necessary to frame this risk, as well as to understand how countermeasures to reduce FOR may be employed. Risk Context The level of BMD loss during ISS missions does not create an unacceptable risk of fractures since there is no acceleration in low Earth orbit. It is unclear whether DXA BMD loss will stabilize at a lower level or continue to diminish beyond 6 months. Thus, the total loss in BMD could be greater with longer missions and consequently longer missions could increase the FOR. It is also unknown if fractional gravity, present on the moon and Mars would mitigate the loss . Taken together, it is possible for a stronauts, after 6 months of deconditioning, to have an increased FOR in at least one skeletal site in a hypogravity environment. The FOR per a given mission architecture cannot be accurately estimated until the time course of skeletal adaptations (which influences bone strength) and the knowledge of mission activities (which influence applied loads) are identified. With this knowledge, the probabilities of bone overloading during the missions can be estimated . Greater understanding of skeletal adaptation to microgravity is necessary to frame this risk, as well as to understand how countermeasures to reduce FOR may be employed. Operational Relevan ce A high risk for fracture is a characteristic of osteoporosis, which is a consequence of the losses in bone mass and in structural deterioration. Therefore, gaps and tasks that fall under the Risk of Early Onset Osteoporosis are also mapped to this risk. The only independent gaps for the Risk of Bone Fracture are the need for Flagship technologies to diagnose fracture and the unknown incidence of vertebr al compression fractures. The task associated with this latter gap is being completed by the Space Medicine Division.

Please refer to ExMC gap 4.02 for further information. HHC is not conducting any work in this area. Gaps B29: What is the risk of vertebral compression fractures? Data needs to be collected for measures of morp hological changes to vertebral bodies (for diagnosis of asymptomatic compression fractures) in crews after long -duration spaceflight; characterize morphological changes to vertebral bodies with longitudinal measures in Astronaut population to characterize changes over time.

Although the degree of loss in bone mineral density over the duration of ISS missions is not of great concern for fracture risk during a mission in low e arth orbit, the actual rate at which these losses occur is not known, and it is not currently possible to predict what losses will occur during a Mars mission. Therefore, as new state - of-the-art techniques become available, in -flight monitoring of bone m etabolism (i.e., changes to both bone mineral density [BMD] and bone quality and their translation to bone strength) should be examined on Shuttle, ISS and during Lunar Sortie and Lunar Outpost missions.

YES# NONOHRP -47065 REV B 292 RISK OF CARDIAC RHYTHM PROBLEMS CRITICALITY: LUNAR OUTPOST C, MARS A Given the condition of microgravity, there is a possibil ity that cardiac rhythm disturbances may occur. Risk Statement Heart rhythm disturbances have been seen among astronauts. Some of these may have been related to cardiovascular disease, but it is not clear whether this was due to pre-existing conditions or effects of spaceflight. It is hoped that advanced screening for coronary disease has greatly mitigated this risk. Other heart rhythm problems, such as atrial fibrillation, can develop over time, necessitating periodic screening of crewmembers' heart rhythms. Beyond these terrestrial heart risks, some concern exists that prolonged exposure to microgravity may lead to heart rhythm disturbances. Risk Context Missions may be impacted by the occurrence of a clinically significant dysrhythmia. It is important to define \"space normal\" for this risk so that appropriate countermeasures can be developed if needed. Operational Relevance Space normal must first be defined for this risk; hence data mining tasks are ongoing. Once space normal is defined, the data will be presented to the Human System Risk Board and it will be decided if countermeasures need to be developed. Strategy for Mitigation CV1: What are the in- flight alterations in cardiac structure and function? Gaps This is a high priority gap for this risk. The task is already u nderway in collaboration with outside investigators. The studies include in -flight Holter monitoring and ultrasound assessment of cardiac structure and function. Further research into this risk is not recommended until the results from this effort are kn own.

HRP -47065 REV B 293 CV8: Can manifestations of sub- clinical or environmentally induced cardiovascular diseases during spaceflight be predicted? 1a: To determine the magnitude of left and right ventricular atrophy associated with long duration space flight, and to relate this atrophy to measures of physical activity and cardiac work in -flight. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be performed pre -and post -flight as the most accurate means of measuring cardiac mass, including sufficient repetitions to document recovery. 1b: To determine the time course and pattern of progression of cardiac atrophy in-flight using cardiac ultrasound. Specific Aims: 2: To determine the functional importance of cardiac atrophy for cardiac diastolic function and the regulation of stroke volume during gravitational transitions, by using innovative, non-invasive imaging techniques to measure the dyna mic component of diastole including: a) tissue Doppler and strain rate imaging to quantify ventricular wall motion with high temporal resolution; b) M -mode echocardiography tude of suction; and c) magnetic resonance imaging with myocardial tagging to quantify the rate of untwisting. 3: To identify changes in ventricular conduction, depolarization, and repolarization during and after long duration spaceflight, and r elate these to changes in cardiac mass and morphology (presence of fibrosis and/or fat accumulation). Although the direct assessment of arrhythmia risk in otherwise healthy subjects is imprecise, the goal of this aim is to combine the best currently available non-invasive tests of arrhythmia risk with high negative predictive value to demonstrate convincingly the absence of risk for life threaten arrhythmias. Data will be obtained twice pre-flight, at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and every 1 -2 months during flight, and 3 times post-flight. In -flight testing will require holter monitoring, 2 -d echocardiography, and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. After completion of this study, the clinical expression of cardiac atrophy during long duration spaceflight will be defined clearly, and its significance for cardiac systolic and diastolic function at rest and during gravitational transitions will be elucidated. In addition, preliminary information will be obtained regarding ventricular conduction and repolarization tha t will provide either strong clinical reassurance, or pathophysiologic insight into the risk for cardiac arrhythmias. After completion of this study, the clinical expression of cardiac atrophy during long duration space flight will be defined clearly, and its significance for cardiac systolic and diastolic function at rest and during gravitational transitions will be elucidated. Deliverables: Risk Characterization_ Evidence The products are quantification of the extent, time course, and clinical signifi cance of any spaceflight - related cardiac atrophy and identification of its mechanisms and functional consequences. This will be accomplished by updating the HSRB; updating the cardiovascular risk and informing mission operations of requirements to support this risk. All data will be passed to ExMC in support of ExMC gap 4.19. If any countermeasure is required, the Space Medicine Division will be responsible for its development.

Under extremely physiological challenging circumstances, i.e. microgravity, astronauts are expected to perform tasks that add additional physical and mental stress to their cardiovascular system such as space walks or robotic operations during EVAs. To date we know little to nothing about the synergetic effects of chronic sleep restriction, circadian misal ignment, and physical and mental stressors on cardiovascular functioning. Specific Aims (1) to characterize the alterations (and potential maladaptations) of cardiovascular and cardiometabolic function (i.e. hemodynamic,haemostatic, autonomous nervous functi oning, cardiac vulnerability, energy metabolism) associated with chronic sleep restriction and circadian misalignment occurring during short and long term duration space missions (e.g. Lunar sorti, Lunar outpost, and mission to Mars; (2) to characterize the effects of different types of stressors (postural, exercise, and mental stressors; except microgravity) on cardiovascular and cardiometabolic functioning during short and long term duration space missions; and (3) to identify the synergetic effects of chronic sleep restriction, circadian misalignment, and different stressors, potentially identifying in vulnerable periods with an increased likelihood of adverse cardiac events during short and long term duration space missions. During space missions astronauts are exposed to unusual light -dark cycles (e.g. Martian day length: 24.65 hrs) that leads to circadian misalignment resulting in sleep disturbances, sleep loss, and poor quality sleep. In addition, almost all astronauts report chronic sleep curtailment due t o mission requirements such as working slam shifts before EVAs and extended shifts during EVAs. The sleeping conditions on the shuttle or the ISS, e.g. cramped crew quarters, noise, and heat, also add to the reported sleep curtailment. Data from laboratory and epidemiological studies have shown that chronic sleep curtailment and circadian misalignment changes endocrine, inflammatory, and cardiovascular function; changes that potentially result in adverse health events, including cardiac arrhythmias, myocard ial and peripheral vascular dysfunction, risk of syncope, hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Moreover, adverse cardiac events show a clear day -night pattern, with a peak in the morning. In addition, it is well know than microgravity itself imp acts cardiovascular functioning resulting in decreased circulating blood volume, decreased central venous blood pressure, increased stroke volume and increased cardiac output, potentially leading to cardiac rhythm disturbances that have been documented dur ing spaceflight previously.

However, there are reported observations suggesting that exposure to low -dose radiation may impart a protective effect if it precedes a larger single dose exposure. To date, few studies have examined whether exposure to low -dose radiation provides a means for mitigating the effects of an acute high-dose exposure. Therefore, using this radiation dosing paradigm (low -dose followed by a single high-dose radiation) in a mouse model, we will determine if the tissue that forms the cardiovascular system (heart and arteries) are protected from the damaging effects of high doses of gamma radiation when previously exposed to a low -dose of radiation. Specific Aims: 1. to measure inter and intracellular levels of oxidative (glutathione and SOD activity) and inflammatory stress (IL -6 and TNF -) in the 3 different radiation treatment different groups (plus control). 2. investigate potential tissue changes by measuring cellular markers of apoptosis from tissues that form the heart and descending aortic artery. Methods: The pilot studies will involve a preliminary experiment with 12 mice and a comprehensive experiment with 36 mice. In the preliminary experiment, the mice will be exposed to a low dose of 0.05 Gy, followed by a high dose of 6 Gy 24 hr later. The mice will be sacrificed three days after the high dose exposure. More time points in both the time interval between the priming and the challenging doses, and the time to sacrifice the animal after the challenging dose will be added in the comprehensive experiment.

Risk Statement Performance of space flight EVA consists of placing a human in a micro -environment which must provide all the life support, nutrition, hydration, waste, and consumables management functions of an actual space vehicle, while allowing crewmembers to perform as closely as possible to a 1 -g shirt -sleeved environment. Improperly designed EVA suit systems can result in the inability of the crew to accomplish planned mission objectives and can cause acute and long -term adverse impacts to crew health. Risk Context In the past, not all crewmembers were capable of performing EVA, but they were not required to in the context of their role during Shuttle and ISS missions. However during the exploration program, all crewmembers will need to perform at a high level of competence in the suit. Therefore it is critical to understand the relationships among suit parameters, subject characteristics, and health and performance. Operational Relevance The Human Research Program has recommended that the EVA Mitigation Strategy Physiology, Systems and Performance Project work with the Constellation EVA Systems Project to develop and execute an integrated human testing program across multiple environments. The testing program will collect the objective data needed to make informed design decisions to create EVA systems that optimize human health and performance across the spectrum of anticipated exploration operational concepts. Multiple analogue facilities will be required due to the ability of each to simulate only certain characteristics of true micro- and partial-gravity environments: Following the 2009 Standing Review Panel, the EPSP Project conducted an extensive project portfolio review. Subsequently EVA gaps 1 - 5 were deleted, and EVA gaps 6 - 13 were created to clarify the areas that should be addressed to mitigate this risk. Applicable tasks from EVA gaps 1 -5 (below) were mapped to the new EVA gaps. Gaps \u00b7 EVA1: What models & techniques are required to evaluate various suit designs and operational concepts to optimize crew health and performance? HRP -47065 REV B 306 \u00b7 EVA 2: What are the physiological and biomechanical stimuli associated with various suit designs and EVA tasks? \u00b7 EVA 3: What suit characteristics, systems, and consumables requirements are needed to optimize crew performance, health & safety? \u00b7 EVA4: What technologies and in-suit countermeasures can be integrated into the EVA suit to optimize crew performance, health & safety? \u00b7 EVA 5: How can decompression sickness (DCS) risk be characterized, mitigated, and/or treated? EVA 6: What physiological & performance capabilities* are required for suited operations? Results from recent integrated suit t ests and other evaluations suggest that underlying physiological and/or anthropometric characteristics may independently affect a person 's ability to perform effectively in the EVA suit. In addition, it is important to understand the basic capabilities required to perform critical mission EVA tasks, and how these capabilities are degraded during transit to the mission destination. Studies are planned 1) to understand possible correlations of subject characteristics with successful and efficient performance of EVA tasks, 2) to characterize the loss of function over a simulated long -duration transit with limited exercise capabilities, and 3) to determine if performance of EVA acts as a counter - measure to protect capabilities during the mission. Data collect ed in these studies will provide knowledge of characteristics and capabilities that enhance human performance during EVA and help determine if countermeasures are needed to protect these during exploration missions. Existing Fitness for Duty Standards for aerobic capacity and muscle strength will be updated as needed and a new EVA Fitness for Duty Standard may be suggested. *(e.g. anthropometry, aerobic fitness, muscle strength & power) Task: Gantt Trace: Determine subject characteristics (aerobic/muscular/anthropometrics, etc.) required for successful EVA performance Short Title : Full Title TBD Subject Characterization Study Responsible Organization: HHC/EPSP Supporting Organization: HHC/ECP ; HEFD/ABF Funding Source : Directed Other gaps supported by this task: M3, M6 -8 Task description: This task will help deter mine the roles of subject anthropometrics and fitness parameters on variability seen in previous integrated performance tests and to determine if these parameters should be added to a slate of standard measures collected during EPSP tests to better understand the variables that most affect suited EVA performance. Aims: 1) Understand whether a correlation exists between certain anthropometric and/or physiological variables and performance in an EVA suit; 2) determine standard battery of tests based upon Aim #1; 3) potentially use this test battery to establish subject selection criteria for certain EPSP tests; 4) inform and/or develop standards pertaining to EVA performance Materials and methods: A cross-center team will determine a standard battery of anth ropometric, strength, and fitness evaluations needed to properly characterize EVA test subjects. Those subjects who have participated in prior EPSP Integrated Suit Tests will be asked to participate (n \u00bb 20 in retrospective portion of study; all future sub jects for EPSP integrated suit tests) and retrospective analyses will be HRP -47065 REV B 307 performed to determine which, if any, subject characteristics correlate strongly with test performance. Expected result(s): Certain subject characteristics are expected to correlate better than others for key measures of EVA performance. Testing of these characteristics will be added to the EPSP Standard Measures battery to be collected during all EPSP integrated human performance testing. Key variables also may be integrated into the Suit Parameter and Human Performance Predictive Algorithm Tool. How task will fill or partially fill the gap: Understanding how subject characteristics correlate with performance during previous tests, shirt -sleeved and using the Mark -III EVA suit proto type, is an important step toward a more complete picture of the capabilities and characteristics that all EVA crew will need to be successful on future exploration missions. However to date the EPSP subject population has been somewhat homogeneous because they had to fit well within the Mark -III suit. The same tests must be performed on crewmembers of differing sizes and aerobic, anthropometry, muscular endurance/strength characteristics, requiring different suit prototypes, before the full breadth of characteristics and capabilities required is understood - and this is essential because on exploration missions, unlike Shuttle and ISS missions, every crewmember will need to be able to perform EVA safely and efficiently. Integration: This task is being developed and implemented jointly with the ECP and HEFD/Anthropometry & Biomechanics Facility (ABF). Data will be shared among these projects and the results jointly published. Deliverables: Tool tools/simulations (Improvements to Standard Measures); Standards update (Possible recommendations for new Fitness for Duty EVA Standard (or entry in STD3001- Vol2)); Risk Characterization __Evidence (Report on findings) Required Delivery Milestone: FY11: Report on Findings & update to Standard Measures; FY12: Recommendations for new EVA performance standards Required Platforms: Ground Task: Short Title : Full Title TBD EVA Performance Bed Rest Study Responsible Organization: HHC/EPSP Supporting Organization: HHC/ECP Funding Source : TBD by this task: M2-4, M7 -8, M10 Aims: Examine performance along a timeline of simulated planetary transit with limited exercise capability to understand progression of de -conditioning and when along this continuum crewmembers lose or have impaired ability to successfully perform EVA tasks expected to be required during contingency or early -mission planetary surface operations. Materials and methods: Study is done in bed-rest setting with subjects performing transit -similar exercise countermeasures and also contingency & planetary EVA tasks at various times throughout the bed rest (1 -mo, 2 -mo, 3 -mo, 4 -mo, 5 -mo, 6 -mo?) Expected result(s): We expect to determine when, if at all, during a planetary transit (Mars mission similar) crewmembers may lose the ability to successfully perform mission critical tasks, whether the exercise countermeasures available help retain that capability. How task will fill or partially fill the gap: Results of this study will not only help us characterize what capabilities are needed, are lost, and when, they will also inform exercise countermeasures and mission operations regarding what will be possible to expect of crewmembers upon arrival at their mission destination. Integration: This task is proposed for development in conj unction with the ECP. Deliverables: Risk Characterization/ quantification _evidence (Final report; updates or informing new Fitness for Duty (FFD) EVA standard) Required Delivery Milestone: Study start October 2011; TBD Required Platforms: Ground - requires bed rest HRP -47065 REV B 308 Task : Short Title : Full Title TBD EVA as a Countermeasure Bed Rest Study Responsible Organization: HHC/EPSP Supporting Organization: HHC/ECP Funding Source : TBD M2-4, M6 -8, M10 Aims: Potential multi-d isciplinary study will help us understand to what extent the performance of surface EVA tasks such as ambulation, geology and construction tasks serves as a countermeasure to physiological changes such as losses in aerobic fitness, muscle, bone, etc. Materials and methods: During bed rest, subjects perform only simulated EVA tasks using newly - developed EVA simulator, and physiological parameters such as VO2peak, muscle strength/endurance, bone mineral density, etc. are measured. EVA tasks would be perform ed in frequency and duration similar to expected design reference planetary missions. Expected result(s): We expect to quantify the ground reaction forces, amount of aerobic and muscular work required to perform simulated EVA tasks and their effects on various physiological systems. How task will fill or partially fill the gap: This study will help us close part of the gap pertaining to understanding how surface EVA tasks serve as a countermeasure. This information will also inform exercise, bone, and other countermeasures and add to the EVA Performance Bed Rest study data in our understanding of what capabilities crewmembers must maintain in order to successfully perform mission critical tasks and help close Integration: This task is proposed for devel opment in conjunction with the ECP. Deliverables: Deliverables: Risk Characterization/quantification _evidence (Final report; updates or informing new Fitness for Duty (FFD) EVA standard) Required Delivery Milestone: Study start FY13; TBD Required Platforms: Ground - requires bed rest Task: This task is described as \"EVA Performance\" under ECP gaps M3, M4, and M6 Standardized \"Pre -flight\" Exercise Tests to Predict Performance during Extravehicular Activities in a Lunar Environment *(e.g. suit CG, mass, pressure, mobility, joint characteristics)? Gap 7: How do EVA suit design parameters* affect crew health and performance in exploration gravity environments and how can their effects be predicted? EVA suits function as miniature spacecraft that support and protect individual crew members. However, in addition to providing life support, they must also allow the human to safely and efficiently perform EVA tasks. Results from recent studies suggest that differences in suit characteristics such as mass, center of gravity (CG), operating pressure, and joint mobility can have significant effects on human performance. Planned studies to address this gap will systematically alter these parameters over their expected design range and evaluate the effects on human performance of EVA tasks. Since there is no \"perfect\" Earth - based simulation of partial gravity, studies will be performed in multiple analogue environments to ensure collection of accurate data. Upon completion of these studies, the findings will be used to update NASA Fitness for Duty ( FFD) or human performance standards in documents such as the Space Flight Human Systems Standard (SFHSS) and the Human Integration Design Handbook (HIDH), and to update HRP -47065 REV B 309 requirements in the Human Systems Integration Document (HSIR). These inputs will provide standards and design guidance to ensure that future EVA suit systems are designed with human performance and health in mind. Task: Gantt Trace: Evaluate effects of CG location Short Title : Full Title TBD Center of Gravity (CG) Evaluations on Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Aims: Evidence from the Apollo Medical Summit and fr om video analyses of falls indicated that the high and aft CG of the Apollo EVA suits caused significant instability for several crewmembers. The current studies will identify and refine the range of acceptable CG locations for prototype exploration EVA suits that permit crewmembers to perform critical mission tasks effectively and efficiently. Materials and methods: Systematic evaluations are performed across multiple analogue environments to ensure collection of accurate data. As the analogue limitations permit, subjects perform a series of standardized ambulation and simulated exploration EVA tasks in a crossover design using shirt -sleeve and suited conditions, 1-g, 1/6 -g, and 3/8- g, and several possible CG locations (e.g., high-aft, high, forward, 'perfect', low, aft, etc.) where the analogue permits. The following parameters are collected, again as permitted by the analogue: 1) Ground reaction forces; 2) Gait characteristics; 3) Kinematics; 4) Ratings of perceived exertion; 5) Ratings of operator compensation/controllability; 6) Subject discomfort ratings and 7) metabolic rate). Expected result(s): Results are expected to demonstrate that crew operates more effectively when the suit CG is most closely aligned with the human's CG, and that CG location effects on performance will vary by task and gravity level. Further, it is expected that work required to control a suit with an undesirable CG will increase metabolic rate. How task will fill or partially fill the gap: These studies are expected to provide a better understanding of how CG location affects performance in the EVA suit, and how identification of a range of CG locations will optimize suited human performance in a variety of scenarios. This information will be provided to EVA to improve de sign of future EVA suits and will also be used to develop and/or update appropriate requirements and standards. Integration : These studies are being coordinated and performed by a cross -center team that includes personnel from Constellation EVA Systems Project Office, and Life Sciences ( ABF, EPSP, ECP, Neurosciences). Deliverables: Risk Characterization_ evidence (Reports of findings); Standards _update (possibly update existing or recommend new EVA FFD or human performance standards) Required Delivery Mi lestone: EVA Suit System PDR (FY10), CDR(FY12); per update schedules HSIR, standards documents Required Platforms: Ground Task: Gantt Trace: Evaluate effects of suit mass Short Title : Full Title TBD Suit Mass Evaluations on Supporting Organization: HHC/ECP Source: Directed Other gaps supported by this task: Aims: The current studies will identify and refine the range of acceptable suit masses for prototype explorati on EVA suits that permit crewmembers to perform critical mission tasks effectively and efficiently. The mass of the suit needs to be sufficient for a given gravity level such that crewmembers have adequate ground reaction forces to conduct both gross ambulation and fine geology tasks, for example. Evidence from earlier EPSP testing indicated that a heavier suit optimized for 1/6 -gravity impairs performance at 3/8 -g, and a lighter suit optimized for Mars gravity is extremely difficult to control during activities at simulated Moon gravity. Therefore the aim of these evaluations is to define an acceptable range of suit masses for each gravity condition and, if possible, a mass range that would be suitable for both Moon and Mars. Suit designers may require modular suits if a single suit is required for both (or all) gravity conditions. Materials and methods: Systematic evaluations are performed across multiple analogue environments to ensure collection of accurate data. During tests, subjects perform a ser ies of standardized ambulation and simulated exploration EVA tasks in a crossover design using shirt -sleeve and suited conditions, 1-g, 1/6-g, and 3/8 -g, and each of several possible suit masses. The following parameters are collected: 1) Ground reaction forces; 2) Gait characteristics; 3) Kinematics; 4) Ratings of perceived exertion; 5) Ratings of operator compensation/controllability; 6) Subject discomfort ratings, 7) Metabolic rate. How task will fill or partially fill the gap: These studies are expected to provide a better understanding of how suit mass affects performance in the EVA suit, and how identification of a given range will optimize suited human performance in a variety of scenarios. This information will be provided to EVA to improve design of future EVA suits and will also be used to develop and/or update appropriate requirements and standards. Integration: These studies are being coordinated and performed by a cross-center team that includes personnel from Constellation EVA Systems Project Office, and Life Sciences (ABF, EPSP, ECP, Neurosciences). Deliverables: Risk Characterization_ evidence (Reports of findings); Standards _update (possibly update existing or recommend new EVA FFD or human performance standards) Required Delivery Mile stone: EVA Suit System PDR (FY10), CDR(FY12); per update schedules HSIR, standards documents Required Platforms: Ground Task: Gantt Trace: Evaluate effects of suit pressure Short Title : Full Title TBD Suit Pressure Evaluations on POGO, Directed Other gaps supported by this task: Aims: This task aims to identify an acceptable range of suit pressures that will allow crewmembers to perform tasks, ranging from gross ambulation to fine dexterity tasks (e.g., actuating toggle switches) effectively while wearing the EVA suit. Consumables will be limited during exploration missions, and use of a higher pressure in the suit would conserve t hese consumables. As a result, vehicle designers and flight controllers may be tempted to recommend higher pressures in the suit than would be optimal for crewmembers to easily perform critical tasks. Such higher pressures may lead to fatigue or injury i f crewmembers must work against the pressure for an extended period of time. Therefore, these studies aim to identify a range of acceptable pressures for given situations that preserve crews' capability to perform necessary functions. Materials and methods : Systematic evaluations were performed across multiple analogue HRP -47065 REV B 311 environments to ensure collection of accurate data. During suited (and unsuited for controls) tests, subjects performed a series of standardized ambulation and simulated exploration EVA tasks in a crossover design using shirt -sleeve and suited conditions, 1-g, 1/6 -g, and 3/8-g, and each of several possible suit pressures. The following parameters were collected: 1) Ground reaction forces; 2) Gait characteristics; 3) Kinematics; 4) Ratings of perceived exertion; 5) Ratings of operator compensation/controllability; 6) Subject discomfort ratings, 7) Metabolic rate. How task will fill or partially fill the gap: The studies completed in FY09 provided a better understanding of how suit pressure affects performance in a variety of gross motor tasks in the suit. This information was provided to EVA Systems Project Office to improve design of future EVA suits with regard to pressure ranges. However future work will likely be required to characterize effects of pressure on performance of fine motor tasks before this portion of the gap related to suit pressure can be closed. Integration : These studies are being coordinated and performed by a cross-center team that includes personnel from Constellation EVA Systems Project Office, and Life Sciences (ABF, EPSP, ECP, Neurosciences). Deliverables: Risk Characterization_ evidence (Reports of findings); Standards _ Required Delivery Milestone: Evaluations stopped at end of FY09; performance determined at anticipated pressure ranges and recommendations provided to EVA, Mission Ops, Space Medicine. update (possibly update existing or recommend new EVA FFD or human performance standards); update HSIR requirements Required Platforms: Ground Task: Gantt Trace: Evaluate effects of joint characteristics and mobility Short Title : Full Title TBD Joint Characteristics/Mobility Evaluations on Directed Other gaps supported by this task: Aims: Evidence from the Apollo Medical Summit indicated that the mobility of the Apollo A7LB EVA suits caused significant difficulties, fatigue, and instability on the lunar surface, independent from terrain effects. Several crewmembers reported in particular that hip and knee joints and gloves were unacceptable and caused excessive fatigue, loss of performance efficiency, and in some cases, injuries. The current studies will identify the suit joint character istics and mobility issues that can be recommended for future EVA suits to permit effective and safe performance of mission tasks. Materials and methods: Systematic evaluations are performed across multiple analogue environments to ensure collection of accurate data. During tests, subjects perform a series of standardized ambulation and simulated exploration EVA tasks in a crossover design using shirt -sleeve and suited conditions, different suit architectures as they are available and 1 -g, 1/6 -g, and 3/8-g. The following parameters are collected: 1) Ground reaction forces; 2) Gait characteristics; 3) Kinematics; 4) Ratings of perceived exertion; 5) Ratings of operator compensation/controllability; 6) Subject discomfort ratings, 7) Metabolic rate. Biomechanics data will be analyzed to determine joint torques and ranges of motion; gait characteristics, metabolic and subjective data will be examined to determine effects of different types or settings of suit joints (e.g., locked or freely moving waist beari ng) affect performance. Expected result(s): Results are expected to demonstrate that adequate mobility is needed in the hip and/or waist to effectively complete exploration EVA tasks. Results are also expected to show that the resistive load experienced by the astronaut will not be sufficient to act as an exercise countermeasure. How task will fill or partially fill the gap: These studies are expected to provide a better understanding of how joint mobility affects performance in the EVA suit. Acceptable ranges for joint torques and mobility/dexterity requirements will be provided to EVA to improve design of future EVA suit joints and will also be used to develop and/or update appropriate requirements and standards.

Materials and methods : Data from EPSP integrated suited tests will be entered into a human performanc e database to associate performance characteristics (e.g., metabolic rate, subjective ratings, suit joint cycles) with a variety of combinations of suit, astronaut and EVA task parameters. From this data, a model will be developed that can predict key huma n suited performance metrics based on input of certain parameters (e.g., gravity level, suit mass, subject anthropometry, EVA tasks, etc.) such that expensive human suited testing may be refined or minimized in the future Expected result(s): Results includ e a validated predictive tool that can be used by EPSP in conjunction with EVA Suit and Life Support Systems personnel to evaluate future suit concepts and life support sizing needs, assuming future concepts do not include suit parameter ranges outside those previously deemed to be acceptable. This tool may also be used by mission planners to refine EVA mission profiles for optimal performance How task will fill or partially fill the gap: Delivery of this tool, containing data from all the series of integr ated suit tests, is expected to finish the deliverables to close this gap. Integration : These studies from which the data are derived are being coordinated and performed by a cross-center team that includes personnel from Constellation EVA Systems Project Office, and Life Sciences ( ABF, EPSP, ECP, Neurosciences). Development of the Human Performance database and Predictive Tool to be performed by EPSP. Deliverables: Technology or Tool _tools/simulations (Suit Parameters/Human Performance Predictive Tool ) Required Delivery Milestone: Annual update to database; Tool delivery in early FY14 (schedule may be affected by EVA suit PDR/CDR milestones) Required Platforms: Ground Gap 8: What are the metabolic costs of expected nominal & contingency suited ta sks in exploration gravity environments and how can heat produced during exploration EVA effectively be removed? HRP -47065 REV B 313 EVA suits must provide life support such as oxygen, carbon dioxide removal and heating/cooling to astronauts during EVA. The crew' s expected metabolic rate is a primary factor in determining how the EVA suit 's life support and thermal management systems are designed. It is critical to characterize typical metabolic rates across a wide variety of anticipated tasks in the expected gravitational, operational, and terrain environments. This will provide the necessary information to design the capacity of the life support system and to determine the quantities of consumables needed to support EVA. Studies to address this gap will determine metabolic rate for EVA tasks in multiple analogues and conditions and the data documented for future EVA suit design teams and provided to Space Medicine and Mission Operations for use during mission support. Emerging technologies will also be monitored to evalua te new methods and/or materials that could be used as countermeasures to mitigate the thermoregulatory challenges of working in an EVA suit. Task: Gantt Trace: Characterize metabolic costs of and thermoregulatory issues associated with EVA tasks Short Title : Full Title TBD Metabolic Evaluations on POGO, ARGOS Responsible Organization: HHC/EPSP Supporting Organization: HHC/ECP Funding Source: Other by this task: Task description: Aims: Obtain metabolic rate measurements of representative EVA tasks in different gravity environments with different EVA suits and EVA suit parameters. Materials and methods: Systematic evaluations are performed using the different analogue environments to ensure collection of accurate data. As the analogue limitations permit, subjects perform a series of standardized ambulation and simulated exploration EVA tasks in a crossover design using shirt-sleeve and suited conditions, 1-g, 1/6 -g, and 3/8- g, and a range of different suit characteristics. Metabolic rate data is then analyzed as a function of the conditions and suit parameters tested to determine the needed consumables for EVA, expected aerobic exercise load to the astronaut, and to determine needed thermal rejection capability for suited operations. Expected result(s): Task is expected to produce metabolic characterizations of a range of tasks in different gravity environments with different suits and suited parameters. As gravity is increased, metabolic rates are expected to increase giv en constant suited conditions. As partial gravity environmental terrain factors increase in complexity, metabolic rates are expected to increase. Depending on where typical metabolic rates fall and the expected average and peak metabolic loads, the life support and cooling systems may have to be altered to increase capacity. Overall aerobic workload will likely not be sufficient to provide sufficient exercise countermeasures protection. How task will fill or partially fill the gap: Task will partially fill the gap pertaining to characterizing metabolic rates associated with known EVA scenarios. Other tasks required to completely close gap. Integration: These studies are being coordinated and performed by a cross-center team that includes personnel from C onstellation EVA Systems Project Office, and Life Sciences ( ABF, EPSP, ECP, Neurosciences).

Effects of EVA Duration on Human Performance Task: Short Title : Effects of Terrain on Performance Effects of Terrain on Performance Responsible Organization: EPSP Supporting Organization: TBD Funding Source: TBD Other gaps supported by this task: Aims: The aim of this task is to compare human metabolic rates during ambulation and exploration tasks in the laboratory with the same tasks on a surface more closely resembling that of a planetary surface. The first phase of this task compared shirt -sleeved performance between laboratory treadmill tests and ambulation at the Haughton-Mars Project (HMP). The second phase will involve analysis of suited performance once an analog facility is developed that can provide suited ambulation over a simulated planetary surface. This phase may also involve use of newer suit prototypes. Materials and methods: The 10-km ambulation protocol used during the EVA Walkback test (2006) was duplicated in shirt -sleeved conditions during the Haughton-Mars Project (HMP) in 2007, and a series of short ambulations was performed during HMP 2008. Data such as GPS tracking, pedometer data, and metabolic rates were collected. Similarly during phase II of this task, laboratory treadmill protocols will be duplicated using simulated surface ambulations. Analysis of these data will h elp to determine how navigating uneven surfaces during EVA may impact ambulation metabolic rates, and therefore, suit consumables required. Expected result(s): The results of this task are expected to provide quantitative correction factors to metabolic rates collected in the laboratory. How task will fill or partially fill the gap: This task will help understand how to translate laboratory metabolic rate data to actual estimates of metabolic rate, and therefore required consumables, for surface EVA. This task will partially fill the gap pertaining to characterizing metabolic rates associated with known EVA scenarios. Other tasks are required to completely close gap. Integration: Completed studies were coordinated and performed by a cross-center team, interfacing with HMP personnel, which included personnel from Constellation EVA Systems Project Office and Life Sciences (ABF, EPSP, ECP, Neurosciences). Integration of phase II testing is TBD.

Materials and methods: The first objective will be accomplished by evaluating temperature regulatory responses in astronauts during steady -state exercise prior to space flight, on a monthly basis while on the International Space Station, and upon return to Earth. The second objective will evaluate the effects of prolonged space flight on temperature regulatory responses during exercise that simulates an extravehicular activity in a Mars or lunar gravitational environment. For both objectives, the astrona uts' temperature regulatory capacity will be evaluated by measuring internal temperature, skin blood flow, and sweat rate responses during the prescribed exercise conditions.

Materials and methods : Core/skin temperature, HR, and met rate are measured while subjects (n=6 for pilot study) perform exercise and cognitively challenging (e.g. PVT) tasks wearing LCVG in warm thermal chamber. Subjects perform two trials on separate days, one self -regulated and one auto- regulated. If proof of concept is viable, further tests will be added on to integrated suit tests. Expected result(s): Task will determine if the algorithm can activate suit cooling earlier than it might be detected by the human, thereby partially mitigating the possibility of overheating and becoming fatigued. How task will fill or partially fill the gap: Task may partially fill the gap if algorithm can be demonstrated to provide early countermeasure to overheating in the suit.

This mechanism would also provide a means to avoid overcooling. Materials and methods: Sample material will be evaluated first by EVA Technology Development Project and, if determined feasible for the intended purpose, a torso garment will be manufactured for testing in suited evaluations. These will be performed as add -on tests to existing evaluations. Expected result(s): Task will determine if the advanced material can facilitate cooling better than current undergarment materials, thereby partially mitigating the possibility of overheating and becoming fatigued.

If determined acceptable, garment will be evaluated as an add -on study to suited tests. Materials and methods: Core/skin temperature, HR, met rate, and subjective ratings are measured while subjects (n=6 for pilot study; later study n=TBD) perform exercise and cognitively challenging (e.g. PVT) tasks wearing prototype LCVG in warm thermal chamber. Subjects perform two trials on separate days, one using the prototype garment and one control trial using the older version of the LCVG. If proof of concept is viable, further tests will be added on to integrated suit tests. Expected result(s): We expect this task to determine characteristics of a prototype LCVG garment that favorably and unfavorably affect crew comfort and performance, particularly with regard to cooling performance.

HRP -47065 REV B 317 pilot study; TBD Required Platforms: Ground Task: Short Title : Thermal Control During Astronaut Traverses Thermal Control Responsible Organization: NSBRI/Hoffman (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) Supporting Organization: HHC/EPSP Funding Source : NSBRI Other gaps supported by this task: SHFE TBD Aims: Refine and implement Mission Planner tool Materials and methods: We have developed over the past few years a path -planning and navigation tool, called the Mission Planner (Johnson et al. 2009, with references to past work), to assist with pre- missi on planning, scenario simulation, real -time navigation and contingency re -planning during planetary traverses. The Mission Planner calculates the most efficient path between user -specified waypoints. Efficiency is based on an exploration cost algorithm, which in the current implementation is set equal to the estimated astronaut metabolic rate. We propose to improve our ability to calculate thermal constraints for planetary surface exploration by incorporating solar illumination into the path -planning tool developed over the past few years at MIT. The results will allow modeling thermal stress during on -foot astronaut EVAs as well as during astronaut travel in pressurized rovers. It will also apply to thermal modeling of traverses by robotic exploration vehi cles. We will incorporate into our Mission Planner lunar topography and surface roughness data as it becomes available from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) experiment on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.

Future exploration missions are expected to have more planned EVAs than ever before. In NASA history, a single astronaut has never performed more than three surface EVAs or four microgravity EVAs in one mission. Some de sign reference missions for exploration have astronauts performing almost daily EVAs over many months. It is important to determine if workload, work/rest cycles, EVA frequency, or EVA duration have an effect on short -term and long -term crew performance an d health over exploration missions. Studies to address this gap will be performed in collaboration with the Behavioral Health and Performance Element and will evaluate human performance in analogues that provide a mission-like HRP -47065 REV B 318 setting. Data and tools resul ting from these studies will be provided to Space Medicine and Mission Operations to assist in development of timelines and countermeasures to optimize crew health and performance. Task: Gantt Trace: Evaluate effects of workload, work/rest cycles, and overall duty day on performance & health Short Title: Effects of EVA Duration on Human Performance TBD Responsible Organization: HHC/EPSP Supporting Organization: HHC/ECP; EVA8; ECP/M3, 4, 6; BHP/BMed4(?) Aims : Determine the effect of EVA duration and intensity of human performance metrics including efficiency, fatigue and cognitive performance.

T he model will relate these variables to objective & subjective assessments collected during the missions to determine which ones are important predictors of outcomes. Materials and methods: Data from prior field analogue tests will be used to develop a general linear model to correlate objective and subjective assessments with performance. Update model with 2010 and beyond data from NEEMO, PLRP, D -RATS missions, and other such mission -like field analogues.

Expected result(s): Validated tool that can be implemented within the communications infrastructure of the EVA suit. How task will fill or partially fill the gap: Development of this tool will provide crew surgeons and flight directors with an objective decision support tool so that EVA crew in danger of performance decrements can be evaluated and appropriately directed back to a vehicle or habitat as necessary.

Deliverables: How can biosensors be integrated with advanced tools, biofeedback & information systems to improve EVA crew performance and autonomy? As exploration missions extend farther from Earth, astronauts cannot rely on having immediate contact with ground support personnel in mission control, and therefore will have to function with more autonomy. EVA suits will need to incorporate sensors and feedback systems that are easily queried to provide the astronaut necessary operational and health/performance information such as oxygen or power remaining, crewmember heart rate, or available feed water for cooling. To address this gap, advanced biosensors will be evaluated for ease of use and ability to function in the suited environment. Other studies will evaluate feasibility of bioadvisory algorithm concepts that monitor and provide feedback regarding crew metabolic rate and consumables usage, to determine if the technology can improve crew performance and autonomy. Findings from these studies will be do cumented and provided Space Medicine and to EVA Systems as recommendations for inclusion in future EVA suit designs.

Later, evaluate updated bioadvisory algorithm in add- on studies during suit test or field analog environm ents where metabolic data will be collected to compare accuracy of algorithm for metabolic and suit consumables calculations. Expected result(s): If validated, the algorithm provides a potentially powerful tool for providing real - time feedback and monitoring work rate for the management of suit life support consumables. How task will fill or partially fill the gap: If algorithm is validated and feasible for use in future suits, the part of the gap pertaining to consumables management may be closed. The portion of the gap regarding whether the algorithm improves crew autonomy may be partially addressed by this task but will require others, such as proof of the voice activated version of the algorithm and studies comparing it with traditional consumables ma nagement procedures.

Dynamic Psychomotor Vigilance (PVT) Tool Gap 11: How do suit fit and suit -human biomechanical interactions affect the likelihood of crew injury? Working in an EVA suit, whether during pre -flight training or during space flight, can cause crew injury. Historically, hand injuries are the most common, but shoulders and feet are also frequently affected. In some cases, these are acute injuries such as skin irritations or pressure points. In other cases, long -term injuries may develop due to limited suit joint mobility or performance of repetitive tasks. While astronauts have historically worked through these irritations and injuries for short duration missions with few EVAs, this may not be possible during exploration missions that have significantly more EVAs and require every crewmember to be available for EVA. Studies to address this gap will determine how suit components contribute to crew injury and investigate potential countermeasures to mitigate suit -induced trauma. Models will also be developed to predict the probability and severity of crew injury during impacts, such as vehicle landing. Data collected in these studies will be used to update NASA standards (SFHSS and HIDH) and requirements (HSIR) documents. These inputs will provide standards and design guidance to ensure that future EVA suit systems are designed to minimize the likelihood of crew injury.

Ultimate aim of this project is to predict probability and severity of crew injuries during exploration vehicle landing scenarios. Materials and methods : 1) Using Finite Element Model (FEM), model NASCAR crash dynamics, and use outputs to relate injury to dummy responses during complex multi -axis (primarily X&Y), high energy impacts; 2) Model human sled test dynamics to improve Human Injury Database fidelity, and use outputs to relate injury to dummy responses. Using human measured responses, and additional ATD sled testing, create transfer function relating dummy and human responses; 3) Using FEM, model IRL crash dynamics to improve Human Injury Database fidelity. Use FEM ATD outputs to relate injury to dummy responses during comple x multi-axis (including Z), high energy impacts; 4) Model Soyuz landing dynamics to improve Human Injury Database fidelity and use outputs to validate injury database and relationships. Expected result(s): Initial Human Injury Database & Initial Prob ability of Injury relationships and updates as more data are available How task will fill or partially fill the gap: Task will fill the portion of the gap pertaining to prediction of probability and severity of landing impact injury under anticipated oper ational conditions.

Materials and methods : TBD Expected result(s): Garment as ideally envisioned will provide dual functions. First, could be used as HRP -47065 REV B 323 an undergarment during launch/entry to protect agai nst impact injury. The same garment would also be an undergarment for nominal EVA to fill the volume of the suit to minimize movement of the crewmember within the large volume of the suit, thereby reducing rubbing or pressure point injuries with the hard suit elements. Such a concept could be inflatable to varying degrees, for example, or use advanced materials that are malleable during gradual movements but become rigid upon impact. Any concept would need to take into account and possibly combine functi onality with existing suit undergarments such as the liquid cooling & ventilation garment, thermal garment, and possibly and orthostatic intolerance countermeasure garment.

Materials and methods : Measure fingertip blood flow and pressure during simulated EVA tasks using U.S. EVA Phase VI glove (n=20, 10 each who have & have not experienced fingernail injury during EVA or EVA training) Expected result(s): We expect 1) there will be a relationship between decreased fingertip blood flow and anthropometric measurements (e.g. middle finger length to hand length (FL/HL) ratio, middle finger length to hand circumference (FL/HC) ratio) of the dom inant hand and 2) the effects of finger pressure on blood flow during performance of the same tasks will be more dramatic when subjects are wearing the EVA glove than during the un-gloved condition. How task will fill or partially fill the gap: Study will provide initial information on how subject anthropometry and glove fit may interact to cause blood flow changes. Data from this study will inform other studies leading to possible mechanisms of injury and aspects of EVA gloves that may cause injuries.

Materials and methods : Glove comparison study ( ideally same subjects and study design as FPS) using Russian Orlan and U.S Series 4000 gloves (as available) and/or new prototype exploration glove. Expected result(s): Data and report describing differences in blood flow/anthropometry, etc among the gloves; includes descriptions of glove designs and recommendations for improvements to minimize injury How task will fill or partially fill the gap: Since no glove injuries have been reported with the Russian Orlan glove, comparisons of performance and injur y characteristics using US and Russian gloves will help us to understand the interactions of astronaut anthropometry and glove characteristics that lead to injury. In turn this will lead to recommendations for new glove requirements to minimize hand and f inger injuries.

Materials and methods : Given proposed suit helmet design options, perform modeling to evaluate the ability of each design to provide impact protection for the head. Expected result(s): Requirements for suit helmet design that meet all needs of the crewmember while protecting them from possible impact injury. How task will fill or partially fill the gap: The head is of critical importance in understanding how to protect suited crewmembers from injury. This task will lead to helmet designs that address functionality and injury protection, closing the portion of the gap that pertains to the suit helmet.

Aims : No single tool or database exists for recording or tracking EVA -related injuries, therefore this task attempts to centralize in one location this information for crew surgeons, NBL physicians, and Astronaut Strength, Conditioning, and Rehabilitation (ASCR) personnel to better communicate injury incidence, treatment, and resolution. Materials and methods : In collabor ation with Space Medicine IT, coordinate & conduct end -user evaluations of existing beta version of the tool, make updates based upon those evaluations and produce secure, web -based final version of the tool. Expected result(s): Single web -based tool accessible by all stakeholders. This tool will become an operational tool owned by Space Medicine, however researchers needing information on injuries can access the information in non -attributable for through the normal data request to the Space Medicine Epidemiology group. How task will fill or partially fill the gap: Currently EVA -related injury data is located in multiple places and we have a poor understanding of the true incidence of certain injuries. Once this tool is populated with all available data we will know better which areas require emphasis to prevent and mitigate EVA -related injuries. Integration : Work is underway with Space Medicine IT and the ASCR group to incorporate the best features of two available tools into the next version of the IT S.

Required Platforms: Ground Gap 12: What is the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) in micro - and partial -gravity environments? *Although this gap is currently identified as a gap in knowledge, an effort is underway (at the time of Revision B baselining) to understand whether DCS is a risk based on planned operational scenarios. Tasks identified here are subject to change based upon recommendations from the DCS review panel The risk of DCS during Shuttle and ISS missions has been reduced to acceptably low levels due to adherence to prebreathe protocols rigorously developed and validated specific to Shuttle and ISS operational environments and scenarios. Our existing DCS databases are based on micro -gravity EVAs and Apollo EVAs were conducted from 100% oxygen cabin and therefore carried no risk of DCS. Thus, no relevant data exist for planetary EVAs, which will incur significantly higher ground reaction forces and metabolic rates, and require greater use of the lower body musculature (i.e. greater muscle volume). The increased utilizat ion of ISS for research provides the opportunity to better understand DCS mechanisms HRP -47065 REV B 326 since no microgravity DCS studies have been performed. In addition, planning for \"flexible path\" exploration continues, and the operational concepts anticipated for exploration -class missions will require vastly different prebreathe protocols to support a variety of situations, including interplanetary transit, partial gravity surface exploration, and contingencies, in addition to ISS operations. The newer crew vehicles and surface habitats or rovers will operate at different pressures and inert gas concentrations than are typical aboard Shuttle and ISS. In addition, the Small Pressurized Rover concept, if implemented, may enable shorter, possibly 2 or more daily EVAs, and even single person EVAs. It is imperative that NASA define acceptable DCS risks and crew disposition policies for exploration missions. Shuttle/ISS prebreathe protocols will not be applicable, and a systematic prebreathe protocol development and validat ion research program will be required to mitigate DCS.

Data may help confirm hypotheses about the benefit of micro -gravity for DCS protection, and rationalize any proposed reductions in pre -breathe time. Aim: To determine whether the onset time and incidence of VGE is different in microgravity compared to 1-g after depressurization Materials and methods: 12-20 astronaut subjects serve as own controls. Three ground sessions, ~3 hours in duration (one of which can be performed R+21 or beyond postflight) and 2-3 inflight sessions on ISS (in airlock, 6.2 psi/34% O2), each session ~3 hours in duration. Buddy -system is used where two astronauts prebreathe 30 min, depressurize to 6.5 psia on 100% O 2 in 10 min, and monitor each other for VGE at 10 min intervals using Sonosite ultrasound hardware for up to 120 min, or until VGE are confirmed. (The imposed decompression stress does not exceed what is currently acceptable for shuttle and ISS EVA.) Expected result(s): Under the given conditions, we anticipate VGE incidence at less than 40% for 1 -g controls, maybe 30%, and for microgravity conditions VGE incidence to be less than 20%, possibly as low as 10%. Knowing for certain that VGE are not present gives us > 95% confidence that DCS is not present. How task will fill or partially fill the gap: Neither the U.S. nor Russia have m-g venous gas emboli (VGE) data, and therefore very limited knowledge of the effective decompression stress in m-g. Good VGE data exists for 1 -g conditions, but lack of data from m-g precludes confirmation of our hypotheses about the benefit of m -g for DCS protection. This study will help us understand if microgravity is protective from DCS risk, and if so, will further guide refinement of appropriate DCS countermeasures. To safely minimize any prebreathe protocols, m-g VGE data is needed as empirical data to rationalize any reductions in prebreathe time. Integration: Study to be developed with EVA personnel.

HYPOTHESES: 1) Ambulation at altitude, under supersaturated conditions, ge nerates bubble nuclei, resulting in increased decompression stress. 2) Preflight ambulation during under -saturated conditions does not significantly increase nucleation or decompression stress on the exercise prebreathe protocols. 3) Light exercise following heavy exercise facilitates the removal of heavy exercise-induced bubble nuclei, resulting in lower decompression stress. Materials and methods: Four separate experiments at Duke Univ. would replicate the PRP Phase II protocol, each with a different ex ception (n=25-50). Experiment I - Subjects ambulatory both preflight and at altitude instead of non-ambulatory throughout. The protocol would be stopped, when the DCS or VGE observations rise to the level of statistical significance (3/25, 5/50 DCS, p<0.0 5). Experiment II - Subjects non- ambulatory during the preflight period and ambulatory at altitude. Experiment III - Subjects ambulatory during the preflight period and non-ambulatory at altitude. Experiment IV - The order of heavy and light exercise would be reversed, with the light exercise occurring first. Expected Results: It is anticipated these experiments will show that for exercise prebreathe protocols, decompression stress is related to musculoskeletal nucleation, and that nucleation can be contr olled to reduce decompression stress. Specifically, that ambulation during the altitude exposure results in increased decompression stress, but that ambulation prior to altitude exposure does not. Additionally, the results will show that reversing the order of light and heavy exercise will result in higher decompression stress, suggesting that light exercise facilitates the removal of heavy exercise induced nucleation. These results will demonstrate that the degree, sequence and level of super -saturation un der which musculoskeletal activity is performed are important in controlling nuclei generation and subsequent decompression stress. How task will fill or partially fill the gap: Understanding this relationship between musculoskeletal activity and the form ation of bubble nuclei will improve scientific understanding of the underlying mechanisms of nucleation in exercise prebreathe protocols and will help quantify variable risk in gravity and microgravity environments. Integration: Experiment to be conducted at Duke University Deliverables: Countermeasures protocol Results of this study may determine whether changes are required to current ISS prebreathe protocols and will inform the development of effective prebreathe protocols for future planetary explorat ion where the volume, frequency, and possibly intensity of musculoskeletal activity is expected to be greater than in microgravity.

These tasks include ambulation, hammering, sample collection, and tool usage. The EVA workload simulator will be designed with the correct materials and volumetric constraints so that it can be used in hypobaric chambers and other tightly constrained spaces. Design options will also be provided for how the simulator could be adapted for bed rest applications. Once validated to determine that the protocol accurately simulates tasks, metabolic rates and force profiles, it will be used in studies to evaluate and validate exploration pre -breathe protocols, to evaluate readiness for EVA after transit time to a given destination and to test the effectiveness of reduced gravity de-conditioning countermeasures in conjunction with regular EVA. Aims : The purpose of the EVA workload simulator is to accurately simulate the tasks, metabolic rates and force loads of expected exploration EVA. Materials and methods : The EVA workload simulator will be a custom series of hardware that will rely on COTS materials to the greatest extent possible. Once built, the use of metabolic data analysis and force collection equipment will be used to determine the correct workloads and protocols for HRP -47065 REV B 333 simulating accurate EVA workloads. Expected result(s): The expected results will be v alidated EVA workload simulator hardware, protocol and operating guidelines. How task will fill or partially fill the gap: This task will provide a tool/test protocol to standardize workloads and force profiles for studies seeking to simulate realistic EVA task work. The task will not by itself fill the gap but will provide a means to implement the studies that will fill the gap. Integration : EPSP is working with HEFD/ABF, ECP and Environmental Physiology Laboratory (EPL) personnel to develop the simulator.

Materials and methods: Work with Brooks personnel to compile and organize NASA & USAF DCS data, then work with NASA Headquarters and JSC IT personnel to publish it to the web under Privacy Act, NASA and other guidelines. Expected result(s): Publicly available database How task will fill or partially fill the gap: NASA and Brooks AFB DCS data are not currently available to the medical and research communities. This effort will make this data available to these communities in a non-attributable format such that it may be used to further our understanding of DCS mechanisms, prevention, countermeasures, and treatment protocols. Integration: TBD _Database Requir ed Delivery Milestone: Delivery of web -based tool in FY16 Required Platforms: Ground Gap 13: What is the risk of hypoxia during exploration missions? The selected pressures and gas compositions for future exploration vehicles and habitats will likely minimize the time to prepare for extravehicular activity and reduce the risk of decompression sickness. To achieve this goal and also minimize the risk of fire, mildly hypoxic atmosphere requirements were accepted based on a computed Equivalent Air Altitude (EAA) not to exceed 4,000 ft in the CEV, 6,000 ft in the LSAM, and 7,500 ft in the lunar habitat. Data evaluated after accepting these atmospheres suggests that the EAA model is only an \"approximate\" model to define hypoxic stress and needs refinement for future NASA applications. This gap will address these issues to determine whether a better method for determining atmospheric requirements is needed. HRP -47065 REV B 334 Task: Pressure Effects of Hypoxia Human Performance Short Supporting supported by this task: ExMC 1.03 Aims: Determine if the equivalent air altitude (EAA) model is accurate to assess hypoxic stress in the next generation of exploration ve hicles that use enriched-O 2 at low total pressures Materials and methods: Each of 25 subjects performs four exposures separated by a minimum of five days, and each exposure is 60 min. Each exposure is preceded by a 60 min baseline control period where subjects breathe air at a PIO 2 of 150 mmHg. Each will don an oral -nasal mask connected to a demand oxygen regulator and are otherwise comfortably seated in a hypo- hyperbaric chamber. There are four experimental exposures to mild hypoxia where PIO 2 is 117 mmHg while exposed to 380, 609, 760, and 1106 mmHg pressures (P B). Inspiratory and expiratory pressures, heart rate, and noninvasive arterial blood oxygen saturation are collected throughout, and starting at 30 min into the exposure cognitive testing (visual a cuity, contrast, reaction time, and cognitive performance battery) is performed via PC -based software to assess mild hypoxic stress. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound to monitor mid - cerebral artery blood flow as an index of cerebral blood flow is performed once at the end of the control and experimental exposures. Expected result(s): Physiological and cognitive responses to mild hypoxia will show an ambient pressure (P B) effect such that hypoxic stress is greater at 380 mmHg than at 1106 mmHg. The results will either refine the EAA model to provide a better understanding of the true hypoxic stress encountered in the CEV / LSAM and lunar habitat environments or increase our confidence in the EAA model if we reject the hypothesis. How task will fill or partially fill the gap: If justified, risk mitigation strategies for hypoxia will be developed for NASA Flight Surgeons to minimize the impact on crew health and performance during future exploration missions.

This risk is linked to \"Risk of Adverse Health Effects Due to Alterations in Host -Microorganism Interactions\". Risk Context Human immune function is altered post -flight and in -flight (limited studies), but it is unclear if this change leads to an increased susceptibility to disease. Reactivation of latent viruses has been documented in crewmembers, though this reactivation has not been directly correlated with the immune changes and is usually asymptomatic. Operational Relevance Primarily relates to closure of clinical risks pertinent to exploration class space missions. Although transient spaceflight -associated immune dysregulation is detectable during short duration flights, it is highly likely not to represent clinical risk to crewmembers. It is possible that some concern relates to 6 - 12 month orbital flight, related to persisten t reactivation and shedding of live herpes viruses. Exploration class flight however, with prolonged durations, elevated radiation levels, limited intervention capability, may represent a significant clinical risk (if data indicates the phenomenon persist s for long duration flight). Specific crew clinical risks include persistent infections, hypersensitivities, altered wound healing. Accumulative clinical risks may include autoimmunity, malignancies. Specific planned operational contributions for the immunology discipline include (A) determination of in-flight immune status; (B) development of a monitoring strategy; (C) validation of countermeasures. Mitigation Strategy While there is post-flight evidence to support this risk, in-flight evidence should also be obtained. The necessary in -flight data should be collected and assessed before further determinations of future research direction are undertaken. Ground-based work should be conducted using the Antarctic station space flight analog (best available analog for immunity during >6 months. flight) so that ground control data of an appropriate sample size may be obtained. Validation of an analog directly to flight data would be useful for future countermeasures validation. The laboratory findings a re to be correlated to clinical findings and follow -up studies are performed to document any latent, long-term effects. Space normal must first be defined for this risk; hence data mining tasks in the form of the Integrated Immune SMO are ongoing. Once space normal is defined, the data will be presented to the Human System Risk Forum and it will be decided if countermeasures need to be developed. In addition, because head down tilt bed rest is not a valuable analog to spaceflight for this discipline, a good analog for immune studies is being sought. Gaps IM1: Does spaceflight alter immune function? This is a high priority for HHC. This data is currently unknown. IM2: Is an improved immune standard needed? Data must be obtained to determine if the standard is accurate and adequate. HRP -47065 REV B 354 IM5: What is the time course and etiology of immune changes? An investigation of individual records of in -flight illness for clarification is needed. IM6: What are the cumulative effects of chronic immune dysfunction on missions greater than six months? Exploration class missions will likely be of durations significantly longer than 6 months. In 2008, the SRP review recommended assessing the clinical consequences of prolonged immune dysregulation. Tasks may use ground analogs or ISS flights (should 1 year ISS durations be implemented). Task: Immune Countermeasures Development Short Title: TBD Responsible Organization: HHC/NxPCM Supporting Organization: Funding Source : Solicited TBD Other gaps supported by this task: The purpose of this study will be to develop countermeasures (i.e., exercise, pharmaceutical or nutritional supplements) to mitigate the adverse effects of spaceflight on the immune system as documented by Immune SMO study. Deliverables: Countermeasur e - TBD (Prescription, pharmaceutical, nutritional supplement, etc) Required Delivery Milestone: TBD Required Platforms: ground (ISS for validation) Crewmember Immune Function: 'Integrated Immune SMO,' SMO 015/SDBI Organization: HHC/NxPCM Supporting Organization: N/A Funding Source: Directed Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Task Description: The objective of this Supplemental Medical Objective (SMO) is 1) to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints. There are no procedures currently in place to monitor immune function or its effect on crew health. Immune dysregulation has been demonstrated to occur during spaceflight, yet little in-flight immune data has been generated to assess whether or not this may be a clinical problem. This SMO will assess the clinical risks resulting from the adverse effects of space flight on the human immune system and will validate a flight-compatible immune monitoring strategy. The correlation between i n-flight immunity, physiological stress and a measurable clinical outcome (viral reactivation) will be determined for long- vs. short -duration space flight. Deliverables: Risk characterization_evidence Data from this study will be combined with the Shuttle-based immune studies to update health standards. If results indicate that a countermeasure is needed, ground -based countermeasure studies will be solicited and performed. Then these countermeasures will be validated on ISS. In addition, all data will be shared with other Elements to help address related gaps such as (1) ExMC Gap 4.06 - Lack of capability to stabilize and treat bone fractures; (2) ExMC Gap 4.08 - Lack of reusable cold compress and heating pad capability made of suitable spaceflight materials; and (3) SHFH Gap related to new Host -Microbe Interactions Risk. Required Delivery Milestone: This task mitigates a risk to a long -duration Mars mission. The tasks are conducted in the 2008- 2020 timeframe because of the availability of ISS as a Mars transit analog.

This will have obvious benefit for exploration class missions, where durations may reach years and the in -flight hazards are greater. Integrated Immune indicates that some immune and viral parameters remain off -nominal for an entire 6-month ISS mission.

Space flight -associated factors such as microgravity, lack of load bearing, stress, and radiation are believed to contribute to these effects, but the exact mechanisms are unknown. Ground-based mouse models such as hind limb unloading (HU) and irradiation cause similar effects. We hypothesize that these changes result from lymphocyte apoptosis induced by the cell surface receptor, Fas, in a manner dependent on endogenous opioids. Furthermore, we predict that radiation exposure and HU act synergistically. We have proposed to: 1) elucidate the role of Fas and endogenous opioids in the modulation of the immune system by HU and radiation; and 2) determine the effect of HU and radiation on lymphocyte dynamics and immune responses. In addition, because autoimmune disease is often associated with stress and radiation exposure, we will determine whether HU and radiation promote autoimmunity. The overall goal is to determine the mechanisms underlying apoptosis -related immune modulation using ground- based models. Deliverables: Risk characterization_evidence.

IM7: What is the correlation of observed laboratory immune changes during spaceflight with known clinical conditions? There is a lack of information directly correlating spaceflight associated immune dysregulation (largely defined by research assays) with known clinical conditions. There are obvious intuitive correlations based on the scientific literature, however clinical immunology is an emergent field and many of the research assays have not yet translated to clinical use. HRP -47065 REV B 362 Task: Spaceflight associated immune dysregulation: normal range and clinical correlation Short Title : TBD Responsible Organization: HHC/NxPCM Supporting Organization: HHC/NxPCM Funding Source : Directed Other gaps supported by this task: Task Description: Integrated Immune, now past midpoint, is the first comprehensive in-flight assessment of immunity, physiological stress and latent viral reactivation. More than any other discipline, clinical immunology is an emergent field, and a direct clinical correlation to the established definit ion of spaceflight -associated immune dysregulation (determined by largely research methods) is not firmly established. This task will apply the validated monitoring strategy, as developed by integrated immune, to clinical patient populations.

HRP -47065 REV B 363 Task: Identification of cardio -metabolic vulnerabilities caused by effects of synergistic stressors that are commonly encountered during space missions Short Title : TBD -Synergistic S tressors Responsible Organization: HHC/NxPCM Supporting Organization: Funding Source : NRA Other gaps supported by this task: Task Description: Under extremely physiological challenging circumstances, i.e. microgravity, astronauts are expected to perform tasks that add additional physical and mental stress to their cardiovascular system such as space walks or robotic operations during EVAs. To date we know little to nothing about the synergetic effects of chronic sleep restriction, circadian misalignment, and physical and mental stressors on cardiovascular functioning. The main goals of this four year NASA project are (1) to characterize the alterations (and potential maladaptations) of cardiovascular and cardiometabolic function (i.e. hemodynamic, haemostatic, autonomous nervous functioning, cardiac vulnerability, energy metabolism) associated with chronic sleep r estriction and circadian misalignment occurring during short and long term duration space missions (e.g. Lunar sortie , Lunar outpost, and mission to Mars); (2) to characterize the effects of different types of stressors (postural, exercise, and mental stressors; except microgravity) on cardiovascular and cardiometabolic functioning during short and long term duration space missions; and (3) to identify the synergetic effects of chronic sleep restriction, circadian misalignment, and different stressors, potentially identifying in vulnerable periods with an increased likelihood of adverse cardiac events during short and long term duration space missions. During space missions astronauts are exposed to unusual light -dark cycles (e.g. Martian day length: 24.65 hrs) that leads to circadian misalignment resulting in sleep disturbances, sleep loss, and poor quality sleep. In addition, almost all astronauts report chronic sleep curtailment due to mission requirements such as working slam shifts before EVAs and extend ed shifts during EVAs. The sleeping conditions on the shuttle or the ISS, e.g. cramped crew quarters, noise, and heat, also add to the reported sleep curtailment. Data from laboratory and epidemiological studies have shown that chronic sleep curtailment and circadian misalignment changes endocrine, inflammatory, and cardiovascular function; changes that potentially result in adverse health events, including cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial and peripheral vascular dysfunction, risk of syncope, hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Moreover, adverse cardiac events show a clear day -night pattern, with a peak in the morning. In addition, it is well know than microgravity itself impacts cardiovascular functioning resulting in decreased circulating blood volume, decreased central venous blood pressure, increased stroke volume and increased cardiac output, potentially leading to cardiac rhythm disturbances that have been documented during spaceflight previously.

Risk Context Lengthening of t he spine in microgravity has been shown to occur during exposure to microgravity (and possibly fractional gravity) and may lead to IVD damage or any detrimental change to the IVD such as protrusion, herniation, degeneration or tear (more research is requir ed to determine whether biochemical changes occur). Muscle weakness, muscle atrophy, and postural disturbances associated with exposure to microgravity may also be contributors. There has been a relatively high occurrence rate of herniated IVD (5.34 events per 1000 person- yrs) observed in astronauts post-flight. Although there appears to be a correlation between IVD damage and spaceflight, a causal relationship has yet to be definitively established. Strategy for Mitigation Space normal must first be defined for this risk; hence data mining tasks are ongoing. Once space normal is defined, the data will be presented to the Human System Risk Forum and it will be decided if countermeasures need to be developed. Gaps B4: What is the incidence of intervertebra l disk damage following spaceflight? The evidence provided by the discipline for this risk was the common complaint of back pain by the crew members. There is conflicting information from the Space Medicine Division regarding the incidence of disc damage post-flight. An assessment of the current database is needed for supporting evidence for this risk. HRP -47065 REV B 370 Task: Data mining for intervertebral disk damage Short Title: IVD DMA Responsible Organization: HRP/SD Supporting Organization: Funding gaps supported by this task: ExMC 4.03 Introduction: Astronauts have complained of back pain occurring during spaceflight, presumably due to the elongation of the spine from the lack of gravity. Herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) is known to occur in aviators exposed to high Gz and has been diagnosed in several astronauts in the immediate post-spaceflight period. It is unknown whether astronauts exposed to microgravity are at added risk for developing HNP in the post -spaceflight period due to possible in -flight intervertebral disc changes. Specific Aim s: 1) investigate if HNP occurs more frequently among members of the U.S. astronaut corps when compared with an age/gender -matched control group. 2) evaluate if any increased risk of HNP for astro nauts could be attributed to participating in spaceflight missions as opposed to general lifestyle and training history. Methodology: For a pre -set study period, incidence rates of HNP were compared between the U.S. astronaut population and a matched con trol population not involved in spaceflight using the Longitudinal Study of Astronaut Health database. Using a Weibull survival model, time trends of the risk of HNP prior to and after spaceflight were compared within the astronaut group. HNP incidences in other populations that have previously been reported in the literature were also compared with results in this study. This task is expected to acquire publishable data on the incidence of HNP in the astronaut population. This task will partially fill the gap by substantiating that there is an increased risk of IVD injury in astronauts due to their occupational activities.

Task : Understanding back/neck pain etiology This task is described in the Risk of Inability to Adequately Treat and Ill or Injured Crew Member - see ExMC gap 4.03. Task : Risk of intervertebral disc damage after prolonged spaceflight Short Title: Funding Other gaps supported by this task: ExMC 4.03 This study will use state-of quantify morphology, biochemistry, metabolism, and kinematics for lumbar discs of crew members before and after prolonged spaceflight. HRP -47065 REV B 371 Importantly , these data will be correlated with low back pain that spontaneously arises in space so as to establish pain and disc damage mechanisms that will serve as basis for future countermeasure development. After successful completion of our investigation, we will deliver a comprehensive database of microgravity -induced intervertebral disc and vertebral changes (type and magnitude) and a prioritization of these changes as to their deleterious effects and risks for crew member injury based on clinical findings. We hypothesize that spontaneous space-flight back pain and disc herniation are due to biomechanical and biological pathomechanisms. First, microgravity leads to higher than normal physiologic disc swelling and increased disc height that may stiffen the lumbar motion segment and cause abnormal segmental movement patterns. These biomechanical changes increase risk for annular rupture, vertebral endplate microfracture, and facet joint capsule strain. Second, increased disc swelling may alter nuclear matrix osmotic pressure and nutrient transport from endplate capillaries in adjacent vertebra. These biological changes adversely affect disc cell metabolism, causing pain and inducing disc matrix degradation. The goal of this research is to comprehensively characterize space -flight induced changes in disc morphology, biochemistry, metabolism, and kinematics. These data will be correlated with measures of back pain intensity and disability. Crew members will be imaged twice pre-flight (over a one -month time frame) to e stablish baseline data and to characterize measurement repeatability. After long -term microgravity exposure (180 days on ISS), crew members will be studied while maintaining supine posture as soon as possible after return to 1 -G in order to quantify the acute effects of prolonged spaceflight. Also, pre- and post -flight, they will don a compression device so that MR images are obtained before and after 50% axial body weight load. This compression device loads the spine and simulates 50% BW load (not including loads from muscles) on the lumbar spine in upright posture. Subsequently, crew members will be tested after 3 - and 6-months of re -adaptation to 1-G in order to distinguish immediate and longer -term recoveries. The measures represent a comprehensive set of tests that evaluate exposure severity, potential injury mechanisms, and pain generator localization. Our research will aid understanding of spinal pain and deconditioning during prolonged microgravity and of the higher incidence of disc prolapse or herniation following re -exposure to 1-G with a long - term view to prevent such spinal deconditioning with exercise or other physiologic countermeasures. Specific Aims: 1. To measure disc, facet joint, and paraspinal muscle morphology and document pathologic features using MRI imaging. Using sagittal scans, we will measure disc height, nucleus area, Pfirrmann degeneration grade, along with previously- validated features associated with discogenic pain: annulus high intensity zones and bone marrow intensity changes (O' Neill et al, 2008). 2. To measure disc free water content using quantitative MR calculation of T2 relaxation (Haughton, 2006). 3. To measure disc nucleus metabolites previously linked to hypoxic stress and discogenic low back pain (lactate and alanine) using sin gle voxel MR spectroscopy (Keshari et al,2008). 4. To identify and quantify possible regions of disc and/or spinal muscle inflammation, and vertebral endplate and facet joint (bone, joint capsule, and articular cartilage) microdamage using positron emission tomography (PET)(Basu et al, 2009). 5. To measure in vivo spinal kinematics to assess segmental stiffness and biomechanical instability using digitized videofluoroscopic images of the lumbar spine and customized analysis software (Breen et al, 2006). 6. To docum ent crew member pre - and post -flight back pain using validated pain (VAS) and disability (Oswestry) questionnaires (Roland and Fairbank 2000) and functional testing (Biering- Sorensen Test)(Latimer et al, 1999). 7. To measure lumbar spine compressibility as a functional disc -risk test in crew members pre and post-flight (Macias et al, 2007).

Required Platforms: This study requires ISS crews for countermeasure validation. # of Subjects Initial Crew Time/Subject None Damage - Dulchavsky Organization: gaps supported by this task: ExMC 4.03 An increased height of astronauts is seen during microgravity; the exact mechanism is unclear. Relaxation of the postural muscles, combined with elongation of inter -vertebral disc spaces may be involved. Back pain is a frequent during adaption to spaceflight; however, this has not re sulted in changes to mission requirements or objectives. Neurologic sequelae have been seen with terrestrial spinal elongation; fortunately this has not occurred in astronaut crews. This proposal will determine the accuracy of MSK ultrasound in characteriz ing the anatomy of the vertebral unit (disc, musculature, facets, ligaments) and develop just -in-time training methodologies to provide essential information to answer operationally relevant mandates with a team of experts to conduct ground, simulated micr ogravity, and in-flight experiments to answer the aims: 1. Determine the accuracy of MSK ultrasound in characterizing the normal and microgravity associated changes in the vertebral unit. 2. Investigate the human factors, level of experience, and training necessary to perform focused cervical and lumbar vertebral MSK ultrasound in microgravity with inexperienced ultrasound operators in parallel with expert operators. 3. Determine the anatomic changes in the vertebral unit during long duration spaceflight with astronaut performed vertebral ultrasound. Baseline evaluation of vertebral unit with MSK ultrasound: Expert sonologists at HFHS will perform MRI and vertebral unit MSK examinations on normal volunteers to assess anatomic accuracy, develop normalization tables, and optimize methodology. Just in time training methodologies for non-expert users a multi- media, just in time training program with reference cue cards will be developed for non -expert operators. The ability of non -expert operators to perform vertebral MSK examinations autonomously or with remote -expert guidance will be evaluated. Human factors analysis of vertebral MSK ultrasound in a microgravity environment will be completed during parabolic flight to optimize subject and operator positioning and restraint. Significance To NASA This proposal will provide longitudinal, real time data regarding adaptation of the vertebral unit during long duration spaceflight to enhance mission completion, countermeasure development, and astronaut health. The abili ty to assess the crew member musculoskeletal system is critical to guide countermeasures, provide functional data for high risk or impact activities, and assess acute injuries which may occur during exploration class spaceflight. Astronaut performed ultrasound examinations on the ISS have demonstrated that diagnostic quality images can be obtained with targeted training: the procedures developed and verified during this proposal will provide novel data and capabilities to enhance crew health for long durati on space missions. This task will fill or partially fill the gap by providing a method to assess the risk of injury due to space travel. HRP -47065 REV B 373 Deliverables: Countermeasure _ prototype hardware.

Risk Context Kidney stone formation and passage has the pot ential to greatly impact mission success and crewmember health for long duration missions. Alterations in hydration state (relative dehydration) and bone metabolism (increased calcium excretion) during space travel may increase the risk of kidney stone formation and it is unclear which mitigation strategy would be the most effective in the context of mission operations. (source is HRP PRD). Operational Strategy Countermeasures for renal stone formation must be validated prior to Mars exploration missions be cause of reduced level of care and prolonged evacuation time. In-flight monitoring must be developed and instituted so that crewmembers will have a means to track their renal stone markers.

Task : The Multisystem Effect of Exercise Training/Nutritional Support During Pro longed Bed Rest Deconditioning: An Integrative Approach to Countermeasure Development for the Heart, Lungs, Muscles and Bones Short Title : Integrative CM Responsible Organization: HHC Supporting Organization: Funding Source: NSBRI Other gaps supported by this task: Sustained exposure to microgravity leads to adaptive changes in the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems that result in substantial morbidity. For example cardiovascular deconditioning may lead to orthostatic hypotension and syncope. A trophy of skeletal muscle will diminish work capacity and may lead to muscle injury. Bone demineralization increases the risk of kidney stone formation and may reduce bone strength increasing the risk of fracture. Bone resorption may be particularly severe after long duration space flight with uncertain recovery. Despite in depth study, the optimal countermeasure for each system has not been defined. More importantly, previous work has focused predominantly on one organ system at a time, ignoring the interaction among systems, and preventing the development of a specific countermeasure for an individual astronaut that might be effective for the heart, muscles and bones. The global objective of this proposal is to 1) test an integrated countermeasure that will be effective against cardiovascular deconditioning, skeletal muscle atrophy, and bone demineralization, and that ultimately can be applied practically abroad the International Space Station or a mission to Mars. Deliverables: Risk characterization_ evidence. Final report of findings will be delivered to HRP who will decide if the proposed countermeasure from this study should be validated.

Risk Context Because the human body undergoes a variety of physiological changes during spaceflight, there is a risk that terrestrial medications may not perform as expected when used during spaceflight. It could be that the spacefl ight environment may require completely new therapeutic agents or prescribing tactics. Alterations in physiology due to spaceflight could result in unexpected drug action on the body (pharmacodynamics) or in unusual drug absorption, distribution, metabolis m or excretion (pharmacokinetics). The spaceflight environment may also have direct effects on stored drugs themselves, leading to premature inactivation or degradation of drugs. Operational Relevance One overriding concern in U.S. manned spaceflight is t he safe return of all crew members at mission's end. Although crew members undergo intensive medical screening, the possibility of crew injury or illness can never be completely eliminated. A mission could be jeopardized or compromised by reduction of able crew members, both directly and indirectly if an incapacitated crew member requires nursing or care. Mitigation Strategy The only data available regarding pharmaceutical use in spaceflight comes from actual spaceflights. Furthermore, pharmacology is by its nature, a multisystem discipline and no ground model of flight has been shown to mimic spaceflight effects on enough physiological systems simultaneously to be globally useful for addressing pharmacological questions. All available data regarding the i n-flight use of pharmaceuticals up to the current day will be gathered and analyzed for trends, especially in the areas of efficacy and side effects. Where possible, animal studies and flight analogs will be used to address specific questions regarding a particular drug or countermeasure to a medical issue.

Thus, the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil may be a useful and safe antidote; however it would be considerably less useful if flumazenil r esulted in loss or reduction of promethazine's antiemetic function. In this ground-based feasibility study, we will examine the resistance of volunteers to a staircase motion stimulus previously used at JSC to study motion -induced sickness and therapies for it. Results will be compared after administration of promethazine and flumazenil, as well as after appropriate control situations to test if flumazenil reduces promethazine's antiemetic efficacy.

Information to HHC Pharmacology REV B 390 RISK OF IMPAIRED CON TROL OF SPACECRAFT, ASSOCIATED SYSTEMS AND IMMEDIATE VEHICLE EG RESS DUE TO VESTIBULAR/SENSORIMOTOR ALTERATIONS ASSOCIAT ED WITH SPACE FLIGHT - CRITICALITY: LUNAR OUTPOST - C, MARS - A Risk Statement Given that there is an alteration in vestibular/sensorimotor function during and immediately following gravitational transitions manifested as changes in eye-head-hand control, postural and/or locomotor ability, gaze function, and perception, there is a possibility that crew will experience impaired control of the spacecraft during landing along with impaired ability to immediately egress following a landing on a planetary surface (Earth or other) after long-duration space flight. Risk Context It has been shown that long -duration spaceflight alters vestibular/sensorimotor function which is manifested in some, but not all crewmembers (some have only partial symptoms while other show all) as changes in postural and locomotor control, gaze control, degradation of dynamic visual acuity, and perceptual changes. These changes have not specifically been correlated with real time performance decrements. The possible alterations in sensorimotor performance are of interest for Mars missions, performance onboard the ISS and return to Earth from the ISS, flights to and from the ISS, Lunar Sorties, and Lunar Outpost missions with prolonged exposure to Lunar gravi tational fields. This risk must be better documented and vestibular/sensorimotor changes must be better correlated with performance issues. Overall, this risk is supported by three factors: Impaired Manual Control Space Motion Sickness (SMS) and Gravitati onal Transition Motion Sickness Impaired Vehicular Egress (particularly under adverse environmental conditions) Current evidence is outlined in the HRP Evidence Book entitled, \"Risk of Sensory -Motor Performance Failures Affecting Vehicle Control During Space Missions: A Review of the Evidence\" Paloski WH, Oman CM, Bloomberg JJ, Reschke, MF, Wood SJ, Harm DL, Peters BT, Mulavara AP, Locke JP and Stone LS. Journal of Gravitational Physiology Vol 15(2) December 2008 Recommendations for this risk were defined by the Human Research Program, Human Health Countermeasures Element Sensorimotor Risk Standing Review Panel (SRP) and submitted as a final report on November 2009. Operational Relevance It has been shown that long duration s paceflight alters sensorimotor function which manifests as changes in eye-head-hand control, postural and/or locomotor ability, gaze function, and perception. These changes have not specifically been correlated with real time performance decrements. The risk of impairment is greatest during and soon after G -transitions when performance decrements may have high operational impact (landing, immediate egress following landing). The possible alterations in sensorimotor performance are of interest for Mars missions HRP -47065 REV B 391 due to the prolonged microgravity exposure during transit followed by landing tasks. This risk must be better documented and NS changes must be better correlated with performance issues. Strategy for Mitigation Space normal must first be defined for this risk; hence, data minin g tasks are ongoing. Once space normal is defined, the data will be presented to the Human System Risk Forum and it will be decided if countermeasures need to be developed. In addition, the NRA solicitation process was utilized to obtain proposals to det ermine any manual and visual control deficits. Gaps: SM2: What are the effects of long -duration spaceflight on sensorimotor function over a crewmember's lifetime? What are the changes in sensorimotor function over the course of a mission? Task: Expanded Longitudinal Assessment of Crew Sensorimotor Function gaps supported by this task: N/A Introduction This task addresses knowledge gaps related to the high variability observed in adaptive responses to gravitational stressors, and the quantitative, longitudinal assessment of vestibular -dependent reflexes in the astronaut population compared to other populations Specific Aims The Specific Aim s will be to (1) utilize well-established clinical vestibular assessment tools for monitoring astronaut sensorimotor function from astronaut candidate tests through retirement, (2) measure changes in simple vestibular -evoked reflexes during and after long-duration spaceflight, and (3) correlate individual changes in vestibular -evoked reflexes with severity of space adaptation syndrome through flight medicine exams. Methods The proposed baseline vestibular function tests are currently in wide clinical use for assessment, monitoring and management outcome analysis (evidence based medicine) of vestibular function in patients with vestibular disorders. These include Vestibular -Evoked Myogenic Potential (VEMP) tests, computerized dynamic posturography (already post -flight medical requirement), dynamic visual acuity, and visual -vestibular interaction testing using a rotatory chair. These tests will be incorporated into the astronaut candidate tests, and periodic exams including the longitudinal assessments that are currently ongoing. The ISS measures will focus on VEMP testing which will involve minimal up-mass and allow self-assessment on -orbit. How task will fill or partially fill the gap The expected results will include a measure of variability in sensorimotor f unction among astronaut HRP -47065 REV B 392 crew members, and a quantitative assessment of chronic changes in otolith -mediated reflexes.

Required Delivery Milestone: Required Platforms: Ground Task: Evaluating Early Changes in Sensorimotor Function after Long-Duration Spaceflight (New) Short Title : Sensorimotor Test Responsible Organization: HHC Supporting Organization: HHC Funding Source: Directed ** Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Introduction Sensorimotor deficits associated with spaceflight along with their operational impacts are most profound near periods of gravitational transition. The most profound deficits occur immediately after landing, but most testing after long-duration spaceflight does not occur until crews can be transported to and tested in specialized laboratories a day or two after landing. The goal of this study is to implement a set of sensorimotor tests that can be performed soon after landing following a long-duration spaceflight to the ISS at remote testing sites like that experienced by the Soyuz landing. These tests will be short in duration and easy to implement in an operational environment. Methods Tests should include assessments of postural stability, dynamic visual acuity and eye, head and hand coordination. How task will fill or partially fill the gap These tests will serve to inform and refine the sensorimo tor risks and will aid in formulating fitness for duty tests. In addition, these tests will be instrumental in establishing a time constant between the immediate post -landing tests and those typically performed at a later time, allowing recovery to be clearly documented. Deliverables: Risk Characterization_evidence Information regarding changes in sensorimotor function near periods of gravitational transitions where operational impacts are most profound. Data obtained is instrumental in understanding expec tations of crew performance on planetary surfaces where assistance is not available. Required Delivery Milestone: Required Platforms: Pre/postflight ISS study HRP -47065 REV B 393 # Initial Title: S HHC Supporting Organization: N/A Introduction Long-duration spaceflight leads to sensorimotor problems which can be critical during landing, rendezvous, and operations on other planetary surfaces. While specific sensorimotor effects have been identified, it is not known which ones have the most adverse impact, or how best to assess them in an operational setting both inflight and immediately postflight. The goal of this study is to develop a device and procedures that will provide a simple and rapid process for measuring sensorimotor alterations without assistance and in minimal time. Specific Aims The study has the following Specific Aims: 1) Refinement of spaceflight sensorimotor -alteration analogs. 2) Development of a device and s oftware for sensorimotor assessment. It will assess performance on sensorimotor tasks determined to be most relevant based on the studies of Specific Aim 1, previous parabolic -flight experience, and knowledge of adaptation to long-duration space flight. Th e device and procedures will provide a simple and rapid process for measuring sensorimotor alterations, without assistance and in minimal time (15 -20 minutes). 3) Testing of the device and procedures with sensorimotor analogs and parabolic flight. Testing in parabolic flight is a key component, as it produces some effects similar to those of spaceflight, albeit acutely, including alterations in otolith -ocular function, posture, locomotion, and motor control. Methods The device will be designed to measure, i nitially, the following functional behaviors that are relevant to safe and effective functioning and are also affected by long -duration spaceflight: 1) Dynamic visual acuity (DVA), a functional measure -ocular and head control. 2) Translational of otolith function and otolith -ocular control. 3) Postural control, by measuring body sway after a transient disturbance. 4) Locomotion, by measuring alterations in the coupling between pitching head movements and vertical body motions during walking, and by assessing variability in stride length and timing which are predictors of fall risk. 5) Roll vection, induced by a rotating visual field that establishes conflicting visual and vestibular orientation information. Head moveme nt in response to these conflicting cues provides a measure of how HRP -47065 REV B 394 well this conflict is resolved. 6) Manual control, by joystick tracking of a visual target, interspersed with a target -identification task that requires rapid response to an intermittent pe ripheral target without disruption of the main task. The apparatus to accomplish these assessments is based on a notebook computer, with joystick and head/body movement sensors. Embedded software will allow rapid assessment of sensorimotor capabilities. The device will be small, require little power and space and provide essentially a self - contained sensorimotor lab/clinic. How task will fill or partially fill the gap This study will refine the procedures and hardware necessary to produce a portable device capable of rapid and autonomous assessments of changes in sensorimotor function in operational environments. Deliverables: Technology/tool_tools or simulations A device and associated procedures that will provide a simple, rapid and autonomous system for measuring changes in sensorimotor function in operational environments. Required Delivery Milestone: Required Platforms: Ground Task : Physiological Factors Contributing to Postflight Changes in Functional Performance (Bloomberg) Short Title : Functional Task Test Responsible Organization: HHC/ Exercise Physiology and Countermeasures Project Supporting Organization: HHC Funding Source: Directed Other gaps supported by this task: SM7, SM3, CV4 Introduction Exposure to the microgravity conditions of spaceflight causes astronauts to experience alterations in multiple physiological systems. These physiological changes include sensorimotor disturbances, cardiovascular deconditioning, and loss of muscle mass and strength. These changes might affect the ability of crewmembers to perform critical mission tasks immediately after landing on a planetary surface. To date, changes in functional performance have not been systematically studied or correlated with physiological changes. To understand how changes in physiological function affect functional performance, an interdisciplinary pre - and postflight testing regimen (Functional Task Test [FTT]) has been developed that systematically evaluates both astronaut postflight functional performance and related physiolo gical changes. The overall objective of the FTT is to identify the key underlying physiological factors that contribute to performance of functional tests that are representative of critical mission tasks. Specific Aims 1) Determine the effects of short and long -duration spaceflight on functional performance. 2) Compare the rate of recovery in functional performance between short and long-duration spaceflight. 3) Determine how postflight changes in sensorimotor, cardiovascular and muscle physiology impact functional performance. Methods The Functional Task Test (FTT) is comprised of a basic set of seven functional tests and a corresponding set of physiological measures specifically targeting the sensorimotor, cardiovascular and muscular changes associated with exposure to spaceflight. The set of functional tests making up the FTT include the: 1) Seat Egress and Walk Test, 2) Ladder Climb Test, 3) Recovery from Fall/Stand Test, 4) Rock Translation Test, 5) Jump Down Test, 6) Torque Generation Test, and 7) C onstruction Activity Board Test. Corresponding physiological measures include assessments of vestibular function, dynamic visual HRP -47065 REV B 395 acuity, fine motor control, postural and locomotor stability, plasma volume, orthostatic intolerance, upper and lower body muscle strength, power, fatigue, control and neuromuscular drive. Subjects are asked to attend one pre-flight training session and two subsequent pre -flight data collection sessions at L -180, L -60, and L -30 days before flight. Postflight data collection sessio ns for short and long duration subjects occur on days R+0 (short -duration only), R+1, R+6, and R+30. A complementary 60 day bed rest study will also be conducted to examine the effects of body unloading on physiological parameters and functional task perf ormance. Expected result(s) This study will identify which physiological systems contribute the most to impaired performance on each functional test. How task will fill or partially fill the gap Results from this study will allow us to identify the phys iological systems that play the largest roles in decrements in overall functional performance. Using this information we can design and implement countermeasures that specifically target the physiological systems most responsible for the altered functional performance associated with space flight.

HRP -47065 REV B 397 Task: Development of Countermeasures to Enhance Sensorimotor Adaptation (Bloomberg) Short Title: SM Organization: Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Introduction During the acute phase of adaptation to novel gravitational environments on exploration class missions sensorimotor disturbances have the potential to disrupt the ability to ambulate and perform functional tasks. These disturbances are likely to impair performance of complex tasks and could, therefore, affect astronaut safety and ultimate mission success. Training with task variability along with exposure to repeated sensorimotor challenges leads to faster adaptation that can be generalized to new environments. By applying these motor learning concepts for training astronauts we can enhance their ability to \"learn how to learn\" to adapt to new gravitational environments. The goal of this project is to develop a countermeasure comprised of a sensorimotor adaptabilit y training program (SA training) to facilitate rapid adaptation to novel gravitational environments. This program will allow successful completion of operational tasks soon after landing on a planetary surface. Specific Aims 1) Determine if a sensorimotor adaptability (SA) training program facilitates performance of functional tasks during exposure to a novel sensory discordance. 2) Determine retention characteristics of SA training. 3) Determine the robustness of SA training during periods of increased cognitive load. Methods Subjects will receive SA training consisting of treadmill walking and manual dexterity tasks performed during exposure to a variety of sensory challenges (incongruent visual input, support surface instability) designed to increase sensorimotor adaptability. The efficacy of the training will be determined by measuring performance of operationally oriented functional tasks during exposure to novel sensory distortions not previously experienced by the subjects during training.

Required Delivery Milestone: Required Platforms: Ground HRP -47065 REV B 398 Task: Ambiguous Tilt and Translation Mot ion Cues After Spaceflight, ZAG / Otolith Assessment During Postflight Re -adaptation (Otolith) supported by this task: N/A Introduction The central nervous system must resolve the ambiguity of inertial motion sensory cues in order to derive an accurate representation of spatial orientation. Adaptive changes during spaceflight in how t he brain integrates vestibular cues with other sensory information can lead to impaired movement coordination, vertigo, spatial disorientation and perceptual illusions following G -transitions. This investigation examines whether adaptive changes in otolith function has operational implications for manual control performance following short -duration flights. Specific Aims The ZAG specific aims for this pre- and post -flight study include: (1) measure changes in eye movements and perception in response to different combinations of tilt and translation motion, (2) measure changes in closed -loop nulling of tilt motion disturbances, (3) evaluate whether a vibrotactile sensory substitution can improve manual control of orientation. The Otolith specific aims include: (1) assess changes in otolith ocular reflexes and subjective visual vertical during unilateral centrifugation, and (2) assess changes in vestibulo -collic reflexes during Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential (VEMP) testing. Methods Both experiments util ize constant velocity Variable Radius Centrifugation in darkness to elicit otolith reflexes in the absence canal or vision. ZAG also utilizes the Tilt -Translation Sled paradigm in which the resultant vector remains aligned with the longitudinal body axis, resulting in mismatch between canal and vision cues which indicate tilt while otolith cues do not. Expected Results The expected results will include a quantitative assessment of acute changes in otolith -mediated reflexes, and the time course of recovery following short -duration spaceflight. How task will fill or partially fill the gap This study will correlate individual vestibular changes with manual performance during closed -loop nulling of tilt disturbances, both with and without the aid of a tactile prosthesis. Deliverables: Risk characterization_evidence; Countermeasure_prototype hardware The main deliverables include measures of manual control measures in the absence of vision and canal input, and corresponding measures of changes in otolith function following short -duration spaceflight. An additional deliverable will be the validation of a vibrotactile sensory aid as a countermeasure for mitigating risk of impaired ability for vehicular control.

Long-term exposure to microgravity has the potential to negatively impact the ability of crew members to navigate and control a landing vehicle and perform post -landing surface operations f or exploration class missions. This goal of this study is to objectively define the effects of long-duration spaceflight on operator proficiency, and identify microgravity -related sensorimotor and/or cognitive deficits underlying degradation of operator ef fectiveness. Specific Aims The Specific Aims of this pre- and post -flight study include: 1) assess changes in cognitive, oculomotor, fine motor, and vestibular mechanisms potentially underlying post -flight deficits in operator performance, and 2) assess changes in astronaut performance on four operationally -relevant simulator tasks: control of an automobile, teleoperation of a robotic arm, T -38A Talon landing, and operation of rover docking. Methods The methods include a comparison of pre -flight (x4 sessions) and post -flight (R+1, +4 and +8 days) measurements obtained on seated ISS crew members using both the physiological test battery (30 min/session) and manual control simulations (60 min/session). In addition, this study will obtain subjective and objec tive measures of sleepiness and fatigue that will be used to assess the cumulative effects of in -flight sleep deprivation and workload on post -flight sensorimotor and operator function. Expected Results The expected results will include a quantitative assessment of acute changes in sensorimotor function and simulator performance, and the time course of recovery following long-duration space flight. This task will address the gap by correlating individual changes in sensorimotor function with changes in operator performance on manual control tasks. Deliverables: Risk characterization_evidence HRP -47065 REV B 400 This task will deliver evidence regarding whether long -duration space flight impairs a crewmember's ability to operate a vehicle, and what sensorimotor/cognitive functions underlie degradation of operator proficiency. This study will also provide evidence regarding whether sensorimotor countermeasures will be required for exploration mission landings and surface operations, along with what areas these countermeasures should target. Required Delivery Milestone: Risk characterization_evidence Required Platforms: Pre/postflight (ISS) # Task: Galvanic as an Analogue of gaps supported by this task: N/A Introduction There is currently no operational analog of post -flight sensorimotor effects, and the primary aim of this project is to deliver such a system to facilitate the sensorimotor risk assessments as well as for crew training and countermeasure development. To this end, this project has developed a prototype ambulatory system that generates a reversible sensorimotor deficit. The system uses Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS), which modulates afferent vestibular input with a pseudorandom current delivered via surface electrodes placed on the skin behind each ear. The GVS analog has been designed such that the sensorimotor perturbation delivered accurately reproduces postural, locomotor, gaze and perceptual deficits observed in astronauts following short - and long-duration missions, without inducing significant motion sickness symptoms. The goal of this project is to develop the GVS analog to operational readiness for use in e.g. crew training, or for use in ground- based assessments of cockpit displays and human machine interfaces. Specific Aims 1) Determine how well GVS is tolerated, and what are the optimal parameters for a single exposure to the GVS analog . 2) Determine how well the GVS analog impacts piloting performance. 3) Determine the long -term response to GVS, e.g. do subjects habituate to recurrent exposure over a year. Methods Subjects are exposed to various levels GVS and perform sensorimotor, cognitive and piloting tasks.

Introduction Crew return vehicles can expose astronauts to altered gravito -inertial forces and elevated vibration levels during launch and landing that can affect their ability to perform their assigned tasks including the override of flight automation in off -nominal conditions. The risk associated with these dynamic phases of flight becomes even more acute when critical tasks are performed by deconditioned crew returning after a long -duration spaceflight. Specific Aims The Specific Aims of this study are to characterize the visual and manual performance changes during: 1) sustained G-force, and 2) vibration experienced during dynamic phases of spaceflight (e.g., launch, re-entry). Methods Subjects will participate in experiments that measure visual, oculomotor, manual control, and autonomic responses during exposure to elevated G on a centrifuge (up to 4 G sustained) and vibrations (9 -18 Hz) in the chest-to -spine direction (x-axis). Expected result(s) Visual and manual performance will degrade as a function of increased G-force and vibration. How task will fill or partially fill the gap This task will provide information on the interaction between elevated G and vibration on human performance. Deliverables: Risk characaterization_evidence Results from this study will deliver: 1) Data and models of human sensorimotor and workload impacts of non-linear interactions between elevated G and vibration. 2) Validated human performance limits for elevated G and vibration that set requirements for vehicle design. Required Delivery Milestone: Required Platforms: Ground HRP -47065 REV B 402 Task: Development of Countermeasures to Aid Functional Egress from the Crew Exploration Vehicle Following Long-Duration Spac eflight (Mulavara) NSBRI Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Introduction Crew member adapted to the microgravity state may need to egress the landing vehicle within a few minutes for safety and operational reasons in various sea state conditions following a water landing. Exposure to even low motion frequencies (0.2-2.0 Hz) coupled with the varying sea state conditions can cause performance deficits in tasks critical to emergency egress activities. Crewmembers returning to Earth by means of a water landing following long-duration space flight will face two significant challenges: microgravity induced disturbances in sensorimotor function coupled with sensorimotor deficits produced by exposure to various sea states. Stochastic resonance (SR) is a mechanism whereby noise can assist and hence enhance the response of neural systems to relevant, sub -threshold sensory signals. Detection of time- critical sub-threshold sensory signals by the use of SR mechanisms may play a crucial role in leading to faster recovery of function during their re -adaptation to Earth G. Specific Aims The Specific Aims of this study are: 1) Investigate performance of motor and visual tasks during varying vehicle motion, 2) Develop a countermeasure based on sub -threshold stochastic stimulation of the vestibular system to enhance sensorimotor capabilities during adaptive change. Methods Subjects will participate in experiments that evaluate gross/fine motor control tasks and dynamic visual acuity reaction time under simulated motions using a six -degrees of freedom motion platform at wave frequencies and sea state magnitudes. Further, studies evaluating efficacy of imperceptible stochast ic noise electrical stimulation of the vestibular system on postural and manual control during body motion and perception of whole -body orientation will be implemented. Expected result(s) It is expected that the performance of motor and visual tasks will degrade during varying vehicle motion. The use of stochastic resonance mechanisms will enhance the acquisition of new strategic abilities and enhance performance during sensorimotor disturbances. How task will fill or partially fill the gap This task wi ll fill the gap by correlating performance changes to simulated varying low frequency vehicular motions for different sea states and the countermeasure should ensure rapid restoration of functional egress capabilities. Deliverables: Requirements_vehicle/suit design Results from this study will deliver r ecommendations for vehicle display and controls that minimize sensorimotor disturbances at low frequency vehicle vibration (0.2 -2 Hz).

Required Delivery Milestone: Required Platforms: Ground SM24: Can individual capacity to produce adaptive change in sensorimotor function to transitions in gravitational environments be predicted with pref light tests of sensorimotor adaptability? gaps supported by this task: N/A Introduction Individual astronauts show significant diversity in their ability to adapt to gravitational transitions. The goal of this study is to d evelop pre - flight tests to identify individual capacity to produce adaptive change in senso rimotor function. This task will comprise of a ground-based study to identify predictors of individual inherent sensorimotor adaptability. This will be followed up with a space flight study to confirm the efficacy of the most promising predicators obtained from the preceding ground- based study. Methods One approach would be for subjects to perform an adaptability assessment battery. This would involve an assessment of how quickly an individual subject responds to a variety of sensorimotor adaptive challeng es (vestibulo -ocular reflex adaptation, manual etc.). These potentially predictive adaptive responses would then be correlated with the ability to produce an adaptive response to a novel sensorimotor challenge. This study would determine which, if any metr ics of adaptability predict the rate of adaptive responses to a novel environment. These could then be used as potential preflight predicators of individual capability for adaptive change. How task will fill or partially fill the gap This study will prod uce a set of predictive measure to determine individual capability for rapid sensorimotor adaptation. This information could be used to produce individualized training prescriptions that target the specific needs of each crew member. These tests would iden tify those individuals who experience particular difficulty with microgravity and partial gravity adaptation, and they could then receive targeted interventions. Deliverables: A set of predictive measure to determine individual capability for rapid sensorimotor adaptation.

Thus, the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil may be a useful and safe an tidote; however it would be considerably less useful if flumazenil resulted in loss or reduction of promethazine's antiemetic function. In this ground-based feasibility study, we will examine the resistance of volunteers to a staircase motion stimulus previously used at JSC to study motion-induced sickness and therapies for it.

HRP -47065 REV B 405 Does exposure to long -duration spaceflight lead to neural structural alterations and does this remodeling impact cognitive and functional performance? Task: Potential Impact of Neural Structural Changes after Long -Duration Spaceflight on Cognitive and Functional Performance ( gaps supported by this task: BMED gap 3 Introduction Previous studies have identified brain structural changes associated with exposure to spaceflight particularly in the somatosensory cortex and the cerebellum along with changes in cerebral blood flow affecting brain tissue reactivity. Changes in brain structure and function may play a direct role in spaceflight -associated sensorimotor deficits, and further may impact the long -term health of astronauts, particularly in advanced age when brain volume loss occurs. Specific Aims The Specific Aims of this study may be: 1) Investigate volumetric, structural and functional changes in task-relevant brain structures, 2) Map changes in brain structures to changes in performance of cognitive and functional tasks . Methods To achieve these aims, subjects will undergo brain structural and functional assessments, using MRI and functional MRI (fMRI) pre and post long -duration spaceflight. Subjects will also perform a set of cognitive and functional tasks to determine the relationship between potential neural structural changes and behavior. A set of complementary animal studies will be performed investigatin g neural remodeling associated with limb unloading and prolonged exposure to high- g environments offered by centrifuges. How task will fill or partially fill the gap It is expected that after long-duration spaceflight there will be remodeling changes in br ain structure and function that may relate to the level of decrement in cognitive and functional tasks. Animal studies have utility in providing the unique opportunity to manipulate a single component associated with spaceflight (i.e. body unloading without the microgravity component of spaceflight) to examine the resultant physiological changes allowing a better understanding of specific mechanisms not available in pre/postflight astronaut testing. The key component of this study would be to link changes in cognitive and functional performance with the degree of neuronal remodeling and determine if structural changes persist for an extended time period.

Risk Context There is a growing body of research evidence which suggests that skeletal muscles, particularly postural muscles of the lower limb, undergo atrophy and structural and metabolic alterations during spaceflight. However, the relationships between in- flight exercise, muscle changes and performance levels are not well understood. Efforts should be made to try to understand the current status of in -flight and post- flight exercise performance capability and what goals/target areas for protection are needed for the in -flight exercise program. Operational Relevance There is a growing research database that suggests that skeletal muscles, particularly po stural muscles of the lower limb, undergo atrophy and structural and metabolic alterations during space flight. However, the relationships between in -flight exercise, muscle changes, and performance levels are not well understood. Efforts should be made to try to understand the current status of in -flight and post -flight exercise performance capability and what the goals/target areas for protection are with the current in - flight exercise program. Mitigation Strategy This muscle performance data will be t aken to the HSRB for review and direction. Due to scheduling constraints with the loss of the Mars transit analogue in 2020, concurrent exercise prescription optimization studies are ongoing on the ground and will be validated in flight. Similarly, research is ongoing to characterize activities of different mission scenarios to help determine the fitness levels required to perform those tasks and therefore, determine the exercise prescription for crew members. Current research is defining metabolic costs of some of the critical tasks. In addition, gender effects, hydration effects and lunar EVA effects are all being examined as well as the possibility for gender specific countermeasures. Gaps M1: What is the current state of knowledge regarding exercise performance? This gap is closed; the deliverable has been met. SM7: Can an integrated post -flight functional task performance test be used on returning ISS crew members to obtain performance decrements? This gap is meant to develop and validate operational tests to define the linkage between functional capabilities and physiological changes. This test should include planetary EVA-like activities The goal of this product is to define crew HRP -47065 REV B 413 members' post -flight capabilities and disabilities, and to educa te them about their risk of injuries, which will help them consciously avoid potentially dangerous activities. This might also define capabilities during early days on a planetary surface. This product will also provide crew members and the rehabilitatio n team members with more objective information regarding their recovery. This test is not germane to understanding how crewmembers will perform during Lunar EVAs since the conditions (duration of microgravity exposure) during this testing are dissimilar t o the Lunar surface. Task: Physiological Factors Contributing to Postflight Changes in Functional Performance Short Title : Functional Task Test (FTT) Responsible Organization: HRP/ECP Supporting Organization: N/A Funding Source : Directed Other gaps su pported by this task: N/A During space flight, astronauts experience alterations in multiple physiological systems due to exposure to microgravity. These physiological changes include sensorimotor disturbances, cardiovascular deconditioning, loss of muscle mass, and strength. These changes lead to disruption in the ability to ambulate and perform functional tasks during the initial reintroduction to a gravitational environment and may cause significant impairments in performance of operational tasks immediately following landing on a planetary surface. To date changes in functional performance that result from physiological changes have not been systematically documented. The specific aims of this study are to: 1. evaluate an integrated set of functional and physiological tests on returning crew members. 2. use these tests to determine how post -flight changes in sensorimotor, cardiovascular and muscle physiology impact post -flight functional performance. These tests will be performed pre and post -flight on astronauts exposed to short and long-duration space flight. The STS/ISS Functional Task Test will assess operational relevance of these changes by measuring the performance of specific exploration tasks (e.g., simulated seat egress, ladder climb, hatch opening, etc.). Additionally changes in functional performance will be mapped standard muscular, neurological, and cardiovascular measures. Data obtained from this study will facilitate the design of countermeasures that specifically target the physiological systems responsible for impaired functional performance.

The installation of T2 with its capacity to measure ground reaction forces offers for the first time the available data collection capability to perform inflight biomechanica l analyses of treadmill exercise on ISS. The objective of this evaluation is to collect biomechanical data from crew members during treadmill exercise prior to and during flight. The goal is to determine the combination of subject load and speed that optim ize joint loading during in-flight treadmill exercise in order model kinematics differences in different gravitational environments as well as to better inform exercise prescription. The specific aims of this study are to: 1. Quantify joint kinematics during treadmill locomotion on the ISS, and to compare those to treadmill locomotion on Earth. 2. Develop a computer model that will assess locomotion speed and external loading condition influences upon joint torque. HRP -47065 REV B 415 Motion capture and ground reaction force da ta will be collected as the from ISS crew member exercises on a treadmill for 30 secs at speeds from 1.5 mph up to and including 12 mph in 0.5 mph increments.

However, despite these previous efforts, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the more complex physiological costs of different activities in a true lunar environment. Recently a ground- based simulation of a 10-kilometer Lunar Walkback was conducted to better understand the physical capabilities of a suited astronaut in partial gravity. Unfortunately, this study was limited because of the use of a stationary treadmill that did not accurately simulate the lunar environment (i.e. landscape and terrain). To date this overall lack of physiologic data collected during true lunar activities or their accurate simulation has limited the ability of NASA physicians and scientists to predict if an astronaut candidate is physically capable of completing the multiple lunar activities that may be required during long-duration missions. The specific aims of this study are to: 1. Develop a mobile testbed to accurately simulate partial gravity. 2. Determine subject performan ce and the physiological responses to lunar activities. 3. Create a series of standardized tests that can be used to determine crewmember read iness for these exploration tasks. Subjects will complete a battery of physiological tests (e.g. upper /lower body aerobic capacity, muscle strength, muscle endurance etc.) followed by a series of exploration tasks such as a 10 km walkback, shoveling, cr ewmember rescue while partially loaded using a vertical -lifting partial gravity simulator.

Identification of which combinations of CEVIS, TVIS/T2, and ARED will result in the optimum balance of fitness in the least amount of time could decrease the amount of required exercise time. These studies should be performed in combination with in -flight measurements of exercise performance, and will give broader insight into what is truly required for the maintenance of fitness with the current devices, as well as into what exercise hardware and exercise prescriptions will be required for the moon and Mars. M8: What is the minimum exercise regimen needed to maintain fitness levels for tasks? This gap is also asking if exercise, in addition to EVA tasks, i s required during 6-month stays on the moon. If exercise is required, what exercise hardware would be required and what would be the correct exercise prescription? In addition, assessment of reduced exercise volume on in -flight performance should be completed. The following questions should also be examined: a) how can suit/task related injuries be prevented b) is the current exercise regimen appropriate for 1/6g and c) is the current exercise regimen appropriate for 3/8g - this is a lower priority question for future work. HRP -47065 REV B 418 M9: What is the minimum set of exercise hardware needed to maintain those (M8) fitness levels? This gap should be filled in three parts. The second treadmill, T2, can be assessed for performance and reliability. New hardware should be developed as soon as possible for lunar missions. Development of hardware for Mars can be developed using information from the ISS and Lunar hardware. The Moon will serve as a test bed for the equipment that is selected for Mars. Task: Integrated Endurance and Resistance Exercise Countermeasures Using a Gravity Independent Training Device Short Title : Adams -Flywheel Responsible Organization: HHC/ECP Supporting Organization: N/A Funding Source : NSBRI (Follow up studies TBD*) Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Extended space flight as well as existence on the Moon and Mars will require exercise equipment and training protocols designed to maintain physical fitness and general health. Studies will investigate protocols designed to maintain both cardiovascular and musculoskeletal fitness using a gravity independent multi -mode exercise device (M-MED), which has been identified by NASA as potential flight hardware. M -MED can provide either high resistance strength - or low resistance endurance- mode exercises. The specific aims of this study are to: 1. Determine effectiveness of the M -MED on measures of muscle strength and aerobic capacity under normal weight bearing conditions. 2. Determine effectiveness of the M -MED on measures of muscle strength and aerobi c capacity during skeletal muscle unloading. On alternate days, the M -MED will be configured for strength training which has been shown to result in increased muscle strength and size. These studies will validate the efficacy of concurrent endurance and strength training as a high economy approach to flight crew physical fitness, using a scientifically proven exercise modality that has a high probability for use during prolonged spaceflight missions. Resistance and aerobic interval is expected to protect skeletal muscle and cardiovascular function with a low volume of exercise. This tasks addresses minimal hardware and protocols needed to maintain fitness for space exploration. *Results from this will drive the need for follow -up studies to 1) evaluate in a bed rest analog 2) optimize the protocol and 3) evaluate in flight aboard ISS.

Required Platfo rms: ISS # of Subjects Initial New Harness For Use with Exercise Countermeasures- Validation of Improved Comfort and Loading with the Center for Space Medicine (CSM) Harness Short Title : CSM Harness Study Responsible Organization: HHC/ECP Supporting Organization: GRC Funding Source : Directed (GRC) Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Treadmill us e in microgravity requires the use of a harness and a system to provide a subject load to keep the crewmember in contact with the treadmill belt. A common complaint from returning ISS crew members is that the current harness is uncomfortable. The pain an d chafing that occurs with the use of the current harness contributes to sub -optimal subject loading (approximately 65% of body weight). A new harness design will be tested to determine if it is more comfortable than the current harness and will allow for greater loading which is expected to result in better maintenance of muscle mass and bone density of the lower extremities The specific aims of this study are to: 1. Determine if the new harness is more comfortable than the current ISS harness. 2. Determine the loading characteristics (waist versus shoulders) for each of these harnesses. Comfort and load data will be collected from crewmembers while walking and running at a low (~65% body weight) and high (~90% body weight) loading conditions. The new treadmill harness is expected to be more comfortable to wear during treadmill exercise due to a more even loading distribution. Development of a more comfortable harness will result in improve exercise loading and thus may minimize the volume of exercise needed.

Short Title : Gender Specific Supplements Responsible Organization: HHC/ECP Supporting Organization: N/A Funding Source : NRA Other gaps supported by this task: B15 Long duration space flight is associated with loss of muscle mass and strength and loss of bone mass. To date exercise countermeasures have not been fully effective. Current evidence suggests that the combination of testosterone, amino acids, and exercise will optimize the effectiveness of the existing exercise and nutritional countermeasures. This intervention may improve exerc ise effectiveness or allow for a reduced volume of required exercise. The specific aims of this study are to: 1. Determine the effect of monthly cycled testosterone replacement in conjunction with resistance exercise on muscle mass, muscle strength, bone mass and markers of bone metabolism in men aged 35-55. 2. Determine the effect of daily leucine supplementation in conjunction with resistance exercise on muscle mass, muscle strength, bone mass and markers of bone metabolism in women aged 35 -55. Testosterone (m en), leucine (women) or placebo (both) will be administered in conjunction with an integrated aerobic and resistance exercise protocol during 12 weeks of head down tilt bed rest. Muscle strength, mass, anabolic intracellular signaling will be assessed in a ddition to bone mineral density and aerobic capacity. Testosterone and Leucine are expected to be gender -specific countermeasures that improve the effects of exercise on preventing muscle and bone loss. This directly addresses a gap by evaluating potential supplements that may allow for reduced exercise hardware or time spent exercising.

Required Platforms: ISS HRP -47065 REV B 423 # of Aerobic Title : SPRINT Responsible Organization: HRP/ECP Supporting Organization: N/A Funding Source : Directed Other gaps supported by this task: B15 Current exercise countermeasures are insufficient to prevent muscle atrophy, cardiovascular deconditioning and bone loss associated with long -duration spaceflight. A known limitation has been the inability of the ISS exercise hardware to provide sufficient loads to the human body that are required for maintaining physiological function. New flight exercise hardwa re, including the advanced resistance exercise device (ARED) and 2nd generation treadmill (T2) are designed to provide astronauts with the ability to exercise at higher intensity. This opens an array of new possibilities for exercise programming in long -duration spaceflight. While the ability to do resistance exercises at heavier loads, the ability to run faster and potentially with more body loading are obvious improvements in exercise capabilities, the details of how this new equipment should be used are not so obvious. The specific aim of this study is to: 1. Evaluate the efficacy of a new integrated resistance and aerobic training (SPRINT) program designed to minimize loss of muscle, bone and cardiovascular function during ISS missions. Highlights of the SPRINT protocol include an increase in the intensity and a reduction in the volume of resistance exercises, inclusion of very short, but high intensity interval -type aerobic exercises, and starting the exercise countermeasures as early as possible in the flight, preferably in the first week. Pre-, in- and post -flight testing, and data sharing with selected on -going medical assessment tests, will be used to assess the effectiveness of this candidate prescription. Tests include detailed measurements of lower b ody muscle structure and function (MRI, ultrasound, muscle performance testing, shared muscle medical tests), maximal aerobic capacity, ventilatory threshold, left ventricular mass and cardiac contractility and bone mineral density. Long duration crew memb ers will be recruited as active subjects in SPRINT; or asked to serve as controls that perform the standard care exercise prescription and the pre-post flight testing.

The project seeks to determine if enriching daily meals with a low-volume leucine supplement will reduce the deleterious effects of microgravity on skeletal muscle and facilitate recovery during rehabilitation. The specific aim of this study is to: 1. Determine if bed rest will blunt the anabolic response to a mixed -nutrient meal, facilitating a loss of muscle mass and functional capacity that is only partially restored during rehabilitation 2. Evaluate if enriching daily meals with leucine will promote protein synthesis and maintain the anabolic response to mixed-nutrient meal ingestion. This will preserve lean muscle mass and function during bed rest and facilitate the recovery of functi onal and metabolic capacity during rehabilitation The study will use an established 14 -day bed-rest protocol to model the skeletal muscle unloading that occurs during microgravity. It will also examine recovery of muscle mass and functional capacity during a seven -day rehabilitation period. Markers of translation initiation, muscle protein synthesis, muscle mass and body composition, and strength and aerobic capacity will be assessed in Control and Leucine groups. It is expected that leucine supplementation will enhance muscle anabolism.

What are the goals/targets for protection with the current in -flight exercise program? The relationships between in-flight exercise and fitness and performance levels are not well understood. It is not clear how the HRP -47065 REV B 429 combination of the three types of availabl e exercise (Crew Exercise Vibration Isolation System (CEVIS), Treadmill Vibration Isolation System / Second ISS Treadmill (TVIS /T2), and the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED)) lead to maintenance of fitness. Factors that limit understanding of crewmember fitness are: 1) the ISS exercise equipment has not been uniformly available to all crew members; 2) exercise programs are individualized for each crewmember, based on their individual preferences; 3) in -flight VO 2max and muscle performance measures have not been possible; and 4) an arbitrary minimum amount of daily exercise time (2.5 hours) has been set and enforced. The impact of this limited knowledge is that it is difficult to make detailed recommendations about what types of exercise will be n eeded for future missions beyond low Earth orbit, other than to recommend that the same suite of exercise equipment be manifested for these missions.

Risk Context Post-flight orthostatic intolerance, the inability to maintain blood pressure while in an upright position, is an established, space-related medical problem. Orthostatic intolerance has been shown to progress to presyncope (inability to maintain standing blood pressure) in up to 80% of returning crew members tested with a post -flight tilt test. The greatest impact would occur on off -nominal landings, especially for Soyuz and CEV returns or when landing on other planetary bodies where there will not be ground support personnel available Countermeasures have been successfully identified and implemented (fluid loading, re-entry compression garments) or being evaluated (midodrine, post -flight compression garments, etc). Completion of these efforts will be useful in determining what preventive measures should be used to combat orthostatic intolerance during future mission profiles. Operational Relevance Twenty percent of Shuttle crewmembers and up to 83% of returning ISS crewmembers suffer hypotension and presyncope or syncope during 10 minutes of upright tilt on landing day. This may constitute a risk when crewmembers experience Earth's gravity after exposure to microgravity. Currently available countermeasures are not effective in all crewmembers; in particular, women are more susceptible than men are. While it is well known that crewmembers can be incapacitated by orthostatic intolerance after six- month missions when they return to Earth's gravity, it is not known the degree to which this may be ameliorated in the gravity environment on the Martian surface. Early surface operations may require astronauts to be upright and active soon after landing on Mars. A combination of countermeasures, both physical and pharmaceutical, should be pursued for this risk. It is not known if exposure to 1/6 g and 3/8 g will cause orthostatic intolerance or will have mitigating effects on orthostatic intolerance upon return to 1 g. Strategy for Mitigation Space normal is defined for this risk; hence current research efforts for this risk are investigations for the efficacy of new countermeasures (i.e., Jo bst stockings and pharmacological agents). The new lunar analog currently under development will be utilized to understand the role of the lunar gravity as protection from orthostatic intolerance. In addition, gender effects and the possibility for gende r specific countermeasures are also being investigated. Gaps CV3: Is orthostatic intolerance a potential hazard? This is considered a high priority for HHC, as it remains an issue for ISS and other long duration flights. It is an egress issue, not a vehi cle control issue. It is not known if exposure to 1/6 g and 3/8 g will cause orthostatic intolerance or will have mitigating effects on orthostatic intolerance upon return to 1 g.

Post -spaceflight plasma volume loss contributes, in part, to the development of orthostatic intolerance. Thus, we are modeling this phenomenon by using a hypovole mia regimen, developed in the Cardiovascular Laboratory, which produces plasma volume losses that are similar to those that occur following spaceflight. This study will compare the outcome of orthostatic challenges (head -up tilt test) conducted in hypovolemic subjects in three conditions: 1) no countermeasure, 2) AGS countermeasure (1 -click or ~25mmHg) and 3) JOBST\u00ae custom compression garment countermeasure (gradient pressure with a higher amount of compression at feet (~55mmHg) than at thigh (~8mmHg) with an average of 25mmHg over the length of the garment). Deliverables: Requirements_ Suit Design The product from this task is to provide mission operations of requirements for g-suit design.

Task: Evaluation of Jobst Gradient Compression Garments as a Countermeasure to Post -Spaceflight Orthostatic Intolerance OIG DSO641 Short Title : Compression Responsible Organization: HHC/NxPCM Supporting Organization: N/A HRP -47065 REV B 439 Funding Source : Directed Other gaps supported by this task: N/A One of the most important physiological changes that may negatively impact crew safety is post -flight orthostatic intolerance. Astronauts who have orthostatic intolerance are unable to maintain a normal systolic blood pressure during head-up tilt, have elevated heart rates and may experience presyncope or syncope with upright posture. This problem affects about 30 percent of astronauts who fly short - duration missions (4- 18 days) and 83 percent of astronauts who fly long- duration missions. This condition creates a potential hazard for crew members during re-entry and after landing, especially for emergency egress contingencies. Two countermeasures are currently employed to ameliorate post -flight orthostatic intolerance; fluid loading and an anti -gravity suit. Unfortunately, neither of these are completely effective for all phases of landing and egress; thus, continued countermeasure development is important. Preliminary evidence has shown that commercial compression hose that include abdominal compression can significantly improve orthostatic tolerance. These data are similar to clinical studies using inflatable compression garments. Custom -fitted, commercial compression garments will be evaluated as countermeasures to immediate and longer -term post -flight orthostatic intolerance. These garments will provide a continuous, graded compression from the f oot to the hip, and a static compression over the lower abdomen. These garments should provide superior fit and comfort as well as being easier to don. Tilt testing will be used as an orthostatic challenge before and after spaceflight. Deliverables: Countermeasure_ Protocol This task is evaluating Jobst pressure garments on crewmembers, final report. Required Delivery Milestone: FY2020 - countermeasure delivery required for long duration exploration missions. Required Platforms: This study currently utilizes Shuttle crews only. Task : Integrated Cardiovascular Study See the Risk of Cardiac Rhythm Problems - Gaps CV1 # of Subjects Initial study NA NA ~0.5 HRP -47065 REV B 440 Task: Gender Differences in Bed Rest: Autonomic and Neuroendocrine Changes and Vascular Responses in Lower and Upper Extremities Completed Short Title : Gender Differences Responsible Organization: HHC/NxPCM Supporting Organization: N/A Funding Source : Directed Other gaps supported by this task: CV1 Although the reasons are undefined, female astronauts are more susceptible to post -flight orthostatic hypotension and presyncope than are male. Due to the lack of cardiovascular bed rest studies that have female participation, many conclusions about the effects of simulated microgravity on humans are flawed, in that they fail to describe mechanisms in the very people who have the most serious problems. Specific Aim : Determine how differences in strategies of arterial pressure control in men and women affect orthostatic tolerance both before and after bed rest. Endothelium -dependent, endothelium - independent and adrenergic receptor responses in both arteries and veins will be evaluat ed, before and after bed rest. In addition, plasma volumes, and hemodynamic and neuroendocrine responses to arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreceptor inputs will be measured, in women versus men, before and after bed rest. Studies have indicated a differential response of different vascular beds in animal studies where hind limb -suspended rats show hypertrophic remodeling of the vessels in their forelimbs and atrophic remodeling in the vessels of their hind limbs. This is thought to occur because changes in transmural pressures and shear forces with hind limb suspension occur in opposite directions in the upper and lower extremities. These studies have not been repeated in female rats, and nothing like this has been performed in humans of either gender. Since humans are bipedal, bed rest would greatly reduce transmural pressures and shear forces in the legs, but not the arms. If vessel -remodeling follows the patterns in humans as in the rats, large changes could occur; this might contribute to orthostat ic hypotension after bed rest. Accordingly, the study will repeat the vascular measurements mentioned above in both upper and lower extremities before and after bed rest and relate the findings to the occurrence of orthostatic hypotension. Deliverables: Risk Characterization/Quantification _Evidence The initial product is space normal data on gender differences with regards to orthostatic intolerance. This information will be used to update the cardiovascular standard to include orthostatic intolerance. If the results indicate that a gender -specific countermeasure is needed, ground- based countermeasure studies will be solicited. When the development is complete the countermeasure will be validated on the ISS and delivered to mission operations. Data gathered from all activities will be fed into lunar surface studies. Required Delivery Milestone: FY2020 - countermeasure delivery required for long duration exploration missions. Required Platforms: Initially this study requires the bed rest ground analog to microgravity. If a gender -based countermeasure is indicated, the countermeasure will be evaluated in the bed rest microgravity analog and the countermeasure will be validated for flight using the ISS. This is a bed rest study to quantify gender -specif ic changes in orthostatic intolerance. If a gender -specific countermeasure is required, it will be developed in bed rest and validated on board the ISS. This ISS is required as the Mars transit analog. # of Subjects Initial Upmass (kg) Upmass (kg/subj ect) None; is a ground-based study None; this is a ground-based study None; this is a ground-based study None; this is a ground-based study None; this is a ground-based study HRP -47065 REV B 441 Task: Effects of emotional stress on the cardiovascular system Short Title : Stress and CV health Responsible Organization: HHC/NxPCM Supporting Organziation: BHP Funding Source : Directed/NRA TBD Other gaps supported by this task: It is becoming clearer that stress can adversely affect the function of many organ systems, including the cardiovascular system.

Risk Context Astronau ts' physical performance during a mission, including activity in microgravity and fractional gravity, is critical to mission success Setting minimum fitness standards and measuring whether crew can maintain these standards will document the effectiveness of maintenance regimens. Operational Relevance In addition to reduced skeletal muscle strength and endurance, reduced aerobic capacity may put mission success at risk. Evidence demonstrates that aerobic capacity is markedly reduced in response to space flight and space flight analogs. Sustained sub-maximal activities (even walking on a planetary surface) could become difficult to perform given large enough decrements in aerobic capacity. As outlined for muscle performance it will also be essential to identify Critical Mission Tasks and associated aerobic costs in order to design and validate effective exercise countermeasures for mission success. Current collaborative efforts with ESA are obtaining in -flight measurements of VO 2max aboard ISS. These measurements can be used as a baseline for future research to \"optimize\" or reduce the amount of in - flight exercise necessary to maintain performance. It was also recommended that VO 2max should be obtained during 6\u00b0 head down tilt bed rest for comparison purposes. Mitigation Strategy Although the strategy to mitigate this risk will follow the general strategy of defining space normal, determining mechanisms and then developing countermeasures, the research planned will be closely tied to efforts investig ating impaired performance due to reduced muscle mass, strength and endurance as well as hardware development. Gaps M1: What is the current state of knowledge regarding exercise performance? This gap is closed; the deliverable has been met and can be referenced in the TBR HRP Deliverables Database. M7: Can the current in -flight performance be maintained with reduced exercise volume? This gap should determine the effects of reduced in -flight exercise; this is a high priority gap. Efforts should be made to try to improve efficiency of the current ISS regime. Identification of which combinations of CEVIS, TVIS/T2, and ARED will result in the optimum balance of fitness in the least amount of time could decrease the amount of required exercise time. These studies should be performed in combination with in -flight measurements of exercise performance, and will give broader insight into what is truly required for the maintenance of fitness with the current devices, as well as into what exercise hardware and ex ercise prescriptions will be required for the moon and Mars. M8: What is the minimum exercise regimen needed to maintain fitness levels for tasks? This gap is also asking if exercise, in addition to EVA tasks, is required during 6-month stays on the HRP -47065 REV B 448 moon. If exercise is required, what exercise hardware would be required and what would be the correct exercise prescription? In addition, assessment of reduced exercise volume on in -flight performance should be completed. The following questions should also be examined: a) how can suit/task related injuries be prevented b) is the current exercise regimen appropriate for 1/6g and c) is the current exercise regimen appropriate for 3/8g - this is a lower priority question for future work. M9: What is the minimu m set of exercise hardware needed to maintain those (M8) fitness levels? This gap should be filled in three parts. The second treadmill, T2, can be assessed for performance and reliability. New hardware should be developed as soon as possible for lunar missions. Development of hardware for Mars can be developed using information from the ISS and Lunar hardware. The Moon will serve as a test bed for the equipment that is selected for Mars.

The muscle discipline should be part of a larger, multi-disciplinary group to define these tasks. They will be primarily EVA tasks, and study groups are currently evaluating these proposed EVA tasks. M4: What are the physiologic costs of Exploration mission tasks? Much of this data exists within other groups (Desert RATS, EPSP, etc). The fitness effort for given tasks can be bracketed with available information. This information can be used to assess fitness requirements. M6: Can a standardized performance measure of readiness for Exploration mission tasks be developed? This should be a cross-disciplinary protocol that includes sub-tasks and measures that cover all affected disciplines. Work should be done in conjunction with ongoing EPSP activities. The HRP -47065 REV B 449 team emphasizes that the testing of individual should not be continued unless this data can be directly related to performance and function. Tasks: Standardized \"Pre-flight\" Exercise Tests to Predict Performance during Extravehicular Activities in a Lunar Environment. This task is referenced under the Risk of Impaired Performance Due to Reduced Muscle Mass, Strength and Endurance - see gaps M3, M4 and M6 Metabolic and biomechanical analyses of extended -duration EVA performance tasks - TBD This task is referenced under the Risk of Impaired Performance Due to Reduced Muscle Mass, Strength and Endurance - see gaps M3, M4 and M6 has been discouraged to measure VO 2max on R+0, because of the possibility of injury to the crewmember, so it has been suggested that a reaso nable compromise would be to obtain in-flight measurements as late as feasible and obtain plasma volume measurements after landing. Also, the cardiovascular laboratory should work with the exercise physiology laboratory to ensure that muscle performance is measured in a similar timeframe as VO 2max is measured. No further research into this area is recommended until this gap is filled. However, it is recommended that the cardiovascular discipline work with the muscle discipline and the Exercise Physiology Laboratory to find the minimum exercise prescription necessary to maintain in -flight VO 2max. M2: What is the current status of in -flight and post- flight exercise performance capability? What are the goals/targets for protection with the current in -flight exercise program? The relationships between in -flight exercise and fitness and performance levels are not well understood. It is not clear how the combination of the three types of available exercise (Crew Exercise Vibration Isolation System (CEVIS), Treadmill Vibration Isolation System / Second ISS Treadmill (TVIS/T2), and the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED)) lead to maintenance of fitness. Factors that limit understanding of crewmember fitness are: 1) the ISS exercise equipment has not been uniformly available to all crewmembers; 2) exercise programs are individualized for each crewmember, based on their individual preferences; 3) in -flight VO 2max and muscle performance measures have not been possible; and 4) an arbitrary minimum amount of daily exercise time (2.5 hours) has been set and enforced. The impact of this limited knowledge is that it is difficult to make detailed recommendations about what types of exercise will be needed for future missions to the Moon and Mars, other than to recommend that the same suite of exercise equipment be manifested for these missions. HRP -47065 REV B 450 Task: Evaluation of Maximal (VO 2max) and Submaximal Estimates of VO 2max Before, During and After Long Duration International Space Station Missions Short Title : VO2 Max Responsible Organization: HHC/ECP Supporting Organization: N/A Funding Source : Directed Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) is the standard measure of aerobic capacity and is directly related to the physical working capacity of an individual. The specific aims of this evaluation are: 1.) To measure VO 2max during and following long duration missions and to assess the validity of using submaximal measurements of heart rate (HR), oxygen consumption (VO 2) 2.) To track changes in aerobic capacity non -invasive measurements of cardiac output (Qc) will be performed during exercise to determine if measurement of Qc will improve the accuracy of the submaximal estimations of VO 2max. For this proposed evaluation, crew me mbers participating in ISS missions of 90 days will perform graded cycle exercise tests to their volitional maximum effort prior to, every 30 days during, and following flight. Measurements obtained during these tests will include HR, VO 2 and Qc. During these tests, ECG will be monitored real-time as a safety precaution. Expected results from this evaluation will include accurate VO 2max measurements from astronauts participating in long duration space flight and observation of the pattern of change acr oss mission duration. Additionally, the evaluation will allow NASA to determine if submaximal exercise testing data will provide results that allow accurate estimation of the crewmembers' aerobic capacity status during and after space flight Deliverables: standards_updates Results from this study will determine if the current countermeasures are protective and need only optimization (e.g., reduced volume, time) or if improved countermeasures and flight validation studies are needed. In addition, result s will be used to provide information to the aerobic capacity standard as well as inform the HSRB. Required Delivery Milestone: This task mitigates a risk to a long -duration Mars mission; therefore the task must be completed by the 2020 timeframe because of the availability of ISS as a Mars transit analog. Required Platforms: ISS is required for the initial flight study; a concurrent ground- based flight analog bed rest will be initiated if initial results indicate an improved countermeasure is needed.

The specific aims of this study are to: 1.) Understand the contribution of hypovolemia to space flight -induced changes in aerobic capacity. 2.) Determine effect of hypovolemia on cardiac function during exercise. 3.) Examine changes in skeletal muscle metabolism during exercise and hypovolemia using non-invasive near infrared spectroscopy. The Johnson Space Center Cardiovascular Laboratory will investigate the relationship between orthostatic hypotension and plasma volume by pharmacologically inducing hypovolemia in 48 normal subjects. The Exercise Physiology and Countermeasures (ExPC) Project and the Cardiovascular Discipline seek to extend this information to understanding the factors involved in decreased exercise capacity. Following orthostatic testing in normal and hypovolemic conditions, subjects recruited by the Cardiovascular Laboratory team may volunteer to perform a graded cycle exercise test to volitional fatigue to determine peak oxygen consumption (VO2pk). Oxygen consumption, heart rate, rating of perceived exertion, and blood pressure will be measured per standard laboratory protocols. Additionally, echocardiographic measures of stroke volume, systolic and diastolic function, blood lactate, plasma catecholamines, and peripheral muscle metabolism by near infrared spectroscopy will be measured. Data from these testing sessions will assist in understanding of the factors associated with reduced exercise capacity after space flight; will serve as a basis of comparison for responses to similar tests after space flight and bed rest; and will aid in the continued development of near infrared spectroscopy as a noninvasive metabolic measurement system for space flight and extravehicular activities.

Risk Context Osteoporosis is a skeletal syndrome that is characterized by low bone mass and severe structural deterioration. This condition can be due to aging or an extrinsic factor(s). Spaceflight -induced bone loss is classified as the latter (Secondary Osteoporosis) and is not contingent upon age. Bone mineral loss occurs in microgravity due to unloading of the skeletal system, with average loss rates of approximately 1% per month. It is unclear whether this bone mineral density will stabilize at a lower level, or continue to diminish. I t is unknown if fractional gravity, present on the moon and Mars would mitigate the loss. Likewise, the impact of multiple long -duration missions or of cumulative time in space is not yet established. Space exposure could be a risk factor for Secondary Osteoporosis after return to earth and could put crewmembers at greater risk of osteoporosis-related fractures at an earlier age than expected for a terrestrial peer group. Greater understanding of the mechanisms for bone atrophy in microgravity, and for recovery after return, is necessary to frame this risk, as well as to understand how current and future osteoporosis treatments may be employed. Operational Relevance Although it is currently possible 1) to determine the changes in bone mineral density and bone quality that had occurred during long duration missions, 2) to determine if bone losses will occur during a Mars visit, and 3) to determine how the risk of fracture is influenced upon return to Earth after a Mars mission, current capabilities are not in any requirement documents for Lunar or Mars missions. However, even after 6 -month missions there are indications that bone quality/strength does not recover as quickly as bone mineral density. This understanding may represent a long-term health e ffect (increased osteoporosis and fracture risk) related to this discordant recovery dynamic. This information is required to assess long - term health risks to returning crew. Mitigation Strategy While atrophy of bone during spaceflight is known and requi res mitigation; the time course of in -flight bone changes, the time course of post -flight recovery and individual susceptibilities have not been fully investigated. The 2007 NASA Research Announcement was utilized to solicit and select proposals to gather these space normal data. In addition, work is ongoing with the Space Medicine Division to obtain long-term recovery data. The long-term goals are to deliver countermeasures during the mission, track efficacy, and prevent lifetime health risk. Due to schedule constraints, countermeasure development has been started in parallel with space normal data collection and technology development. HRP -47065 REV B 456 Gaps B1: a) Is there an increased lifetime risk of fragility fractures/osteoporosis in astronauts; b) is bone strength completely recovered post -flight, and does BMD reflect it; c) what are the risk factors for poor recovery of BMD/bone strength? It is a high priority to determine whether changes occur in the macro - and microstructure of bone during long-duration sp aceflight that, even with recovery of pre -flight BMD, adversely impact long -term risk. Is this influenced by multiple flights? What other measures of bone contribute to bone strength independent of BMD (\"Bone Quality\")? Task : Contributors to long term recovery of bone strength following exposure to microgravity Short Title : Bone strength recovery Responsible Organization: HHC/ NxPCM Supporting Organization: Funding Source : NRA Other gaps supported by this task: Introduction: There is an increase i n bone mineral density [BMD] in astronauts following long-duration missions (typically 4- 6 months) that suggests a recovery to preflight status. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in the rate of, and the skeletal sites for, BMD increase. Furt hermore, it is uncertain if the restoration of BMD in the postflight period reflects a restoration of bone strength because BMD, as measured by Dual -energy x -ray absorptiometry (DXA), accounts for only 50 -70% of bone strength. The goal of this project is to understand how bone that has adapted to mechanical unloading (e.g., prolonged space exposure) responds to mechanical re -loading (e.g., re -ambulation in partial or unit gravity) by using a rodent animal model. The dynamics of anatomically -specific bone loss and bone recovery will be compared between the rat and human to evaluate the utility and robustness of rodent animal models to predict clinical outcomes. Finally, the project will compare and contrast the effects of aerobic and resistive exercise in restoring skeletal integrity during recovery from mechanical unloading. Because the use of rodent models enable direct assessment of tissue changes and of bone strength (calculated/estimated bone strengths with actual measured strengths); this project can inform further studies in the application of exercise to combat losses in bone mass from age -related changes and due to prolonged spaceflight. Specific aims : 1) Address the observed \"discordant recovery dynamic\" reported for astronaut data (Lang et al., JBMR 21:1224, 2006) by characterizing bone mass, bone mineral density (BMD), and bone strength relationships after HU and during various periods of recovery. 2) Examine multiple mission scenarios using HU, recovery for a period, and then a second HU exposure. 3) Follow the two-exposure protocol but with exercise (both aerobic and resistive) added during the recovery period. Methodology: Three sets of experiments will be conducted to address three specific aims. In all cases, adult male Sprague -Dawley rats (6 -mos. -old) will be used, and the period of initial HU will be 28 days. Recovery will be characterized in two ways: (a) by comparing to age- matched, ambulatory cage control animals (no HU, but same age); and (b) by comparing to values at the end of the initial 28 days of HU (day 0 of recovery). The major outcome variables to be examined are bone mass (size, geometry, BMC), bone mineral density (total, cortical, cancellous BMD), and bone quality (strength, plus measures of tissue-level organic matr ix). Tissue -level organic matrix assays will quantify collagen content, cross-link maturity, and gene expression. These will be assessed to describe the response of both cortical and cancellous bone, both separately and combined (integrally). This task is expected to inform HHC i) which factors are most critical to monitor in assessing recovery of bone health following single or multiple missions and ii) how resistance training and aerobic training (i.e., treadmill running) influence bone recovery after a n initial exposure to microgravity. This task will partially close the GAP by providing the information to direct the measurement of appropriate indices of bone quality and mass - to monitor bone strength and to confirm the recovery dynamics observed in animal model. This task is shared with the medical operations Risk for Bone Fracture because it provides a direct measure of Factor of Risk (applied loads to bone failure loads with mechanical strength testing); such destructive measures cannot be perfo rmed clinically.

Bone Discipline Lead will convene a panel of experts to determine testing regimen for younger, healthy persons exposed to long durati on spaceflight and will return to SMCCB with proposed plan for implementation. Specific Aim: Convene a panel of clinical experts to review medical and research dataset from long duration crewmembers. Charge to the panel includes evaluating the level of evidence-to -date to determine if an intervention is warranted to mitigate early onset osteoporosis in crewmembers exposed to prolonged spaceflight (~ 4 -6 months) during a single or multiple missions. Methodology: 1) Identify experts (n=10) in male osteoporosis, epidemiology, bone mineral density by DXA, and in clinical risk factors for osteoporosis to serve on panel. 2) Compile all medical and research data conducted on long- duration crewmembers (including international partners ~N=40) during flight and after return. 3) Present both trends in physiological decline and recovery for astronaut group and individual charts of each crewmember dataset. 4) Prepare final report, with concurrence by panel members, to SMCCB. 5) Prepare and submit a publication to bone specialty journal outlying recommendations for a NASA bone health program.

It remains unknown what this loss signifies for future fracture risk in the post-mission period for crewmembers. The mechanical unloading of the skeleton in the weightless environment of space is considered the key factor contributing to bone loss, although there are likely other factors that also play a role. Epidemiology is study of risk factors that affect the incidence of a disease or syndrome (such as osteoporosis) in a population. This project will improve NASA's understanding of the risk for fracture in astronauts following long-duration space flight, as well as the factors contributing to bone loss in microgravity, and its recovery. These analyses are the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine and will help develop better prevention strategies for the benefit of crew health, both during and after l ong- duration space exploration, and mission success. Specific Aims: 1) To investigate the risk of microgravity exposure on long-term changes in bone health and fracture risk. 2) To provide a summary of the current evidence available on potential risk factors for bone loss, recovery and fracture following long-duration space exploration. Methodology : The proposed research will take advantage of an established population-based cohort, which includes men and women of an age range similar to crewmembers in the US space program, who have had bone density measured over time. Comparisons will be made between bone densities of crewmembers and the population -based data and use fracture prediction models derived from the cohort to make estimations on fracture risk among crewmembers. Data already gathered to date during the US human space program will be mined to summarize the current state of evidence available on additional risk factors related to bone loss and recovery in microgravity to interpret their potential influence on fracture risk. This tasks is expected to inform Health Standards and recommend update if supported by data - to-date; to Inform other elements (HHC, SD) for directing research and for medical operations; and determines if long -duration astronauts are at earlier risk for fragility fractures compared to terrestrial population and to peer-group (i.e., short -duration astronauts) in which no increase in fracture risk is hypothesized. The task will fill or partially fill the gap by providing evidence-based information regarding the risk for fragility fractures - estimation of risk is improved with increase in population data. Information will also guide the direction of further HHC research required to better understand the risk of bone loss and fracture among crewmembers and the countermeasure strategies that could be developed to prevent it from occurring. Generated information will be shared with the Space Medicine Division for their Conditions List.

A genetically diverse mouse population has been identified that, similar to astronauts, includes a diverse range of responses to hind limb unloading and reambulation. Using this population, here, the consequences of multiple exposures to simulated weightlessness on long -term quantity and quality of trabecular and cortical bone as well as muscle will be addressed, and how recovery periods between periods of weightlessness can be optimized will be investigated. Specific Aims: 1) Determine whether the total exposure time to weightlessness or the number of repetitive exposures is the primary determinant of skeletal morphology and strength. 2) Determine the musculoskeletal consequences of altering the length and distribution of the r ecovery periods between multiple exposures to weightlessness. Methodology : a) Assess longitudinal changes in tissue morphology, density, and mechanical properties in each genetically distinct mouse by in vivo microCT and finite -element modeling, allowing f or the identification of skeletal baseline indices that modulate changes in tissue morphology and strength during altered levels of loading. b) Perform detailed mechanical tests at the endpoints to assess the long - term quality of the tissue. Together, the proposed studies provide a unique opportunity to establish the range of responses of genetically diverse individuals to multiple unloading and reambulation phases. c) Optimize the length and distribution of recovery periods between disuse exposures in an a ttempt to maintain long -term musculoskeletal morphology and strength. This task is expected to provide knowledge to Elements (Medical Operations, Human Health and Countermeasures) as to the impact of prolonged spaceflight on long-term bone health which may help direct the development and application of appropriate countermeasures This task will partially fill the gap by using a mouse experiment that can be designed with genetically manipulated mice to model recovery patterns in astronauts after return.

If shown to be an effective countermeasure to space flight-induced bone loss, Bisphosphonates could prevent or ameliorate several potential bone - related problems. This study is being conducted in conjunction with the Japan Space Agency. Specific Aims : 1. Obtain preflight and postflight Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip. This study aims to show that bisphosphonates will significantly reduce bone mineral density loss and the increased risk of renal stone formation documented previously on untreated ISS crewmembers. 2. Perform: preflight and postflight Dual-energy X- Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans of the whole body, spine, hip, and heel; preflight and postflight scans of the tibia using peripheral Computed Tomography preflight and postflight abdominal/retroperitoneal Ultrasound scans; preflight and postflight blood draw s to measure serum markers of bone metabolism, and preflight, in-flight, and postflight urine collections to measure urinary markers of bone metabolism. Urine measurements will also be used to look at the risk for developing renal stones before, during and after flight. Methodology : Two dosing regimens will be used: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of alendronate taken weekly during flight or (2) an IV dose of zoledronic acid 4 mg, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. Secondary goals will be to document the return to normal bone remodeling post - flight in crewmembers who took Bisphosphonates. This task is expected to determine whether antiresorptive bisphosphonates, in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program, will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS flights.

HRP -47065 REV B 463 Task: Nutrition Nutritional Status Assessment SMO 016 Short Title : Nutrition SMO Responsible Organization: HHC/NxPCM Supporting Organization : Funding Source : Directed Other gaps supported by this task: N14, N7 Introduction: Nutritional status is clearly altered after long -duration space flight. It is imperative that we determine the mechanism and kinetics of these changes if we are going to send crew members on prolonged space missions. . Maintaining and monitoring nutritional status are important for ensuring crew health during space flight, and will be critical as we begin to embark on the longer duration exploration missions in the future. In-flight may also help to better understand human health. Specific Aims : Include in-flight blood/urine collections and monitor additional parameters to better monitor nutritional status. Evaluate changes in nutritional status with ch anges in bone health, body composition, and oxidative damage to define nutritional requirements. Methodology : Collect blood and urine samples before, during and after spaceflight and analyze in a batch after flight. Investigators will measure blood levels of vitamins, minerals, oxidative damage markers, markers of iron and calcium metabolism, bone - and calcium -regulating hormones, markers of cardiovascular risk (associated with nutritional status), stress hormones, and urinary markers of bone turnover. D ata will be collected before, during and after flight. This task would allow for better health monitoring, and allow for more accurate recommendations to be made for crew rehabilitation. These additional parameters were added due to the recommendation of an extramural panel that met to define nutritional standards and requirements in 2005. This task would close the gap by providing an operationally effective and integrative countermeasure to the reduction in bone strength during spaceflight. Data from this task will be shared within the HHC element to explore cross-discipline risk factors and their association with bone loss, and with SHFH to address countermeasures in Advanced Food Technology.

By directing an exercise protocol to prevent skeletal adaptation to space, we prevent a cascade of subsequent physiological changes that may introduce health risks in and of themselves. For example, bone decalcification can increase the risk for renal stones and can also perturb the body's hormonal system that conserve calcium in the body and absorb calcium from the diet ( in Evidence Book ). Thus, an optimal exercise prescription could have crosscutting effects that preserves or maintains over all bone health. Task: Integrated Resistance and Aerobic Training Study Shor t Title : SPRINT Responsible Organization: HHC/ECP Supporting Organization: Funding Source : Directed Other gaps this task: B1c, M7, M8, M9 and M10 Introduction: Current are insufficient to prevent muscle atrophy, cardiovascular deconditioning and bone loss associated with long-duration spaceflight. A known limitation has been the inability of the ISS exercise hardware to provide sufficient loads to the human body that are required for maintaining physiological funct ion. New flight exercise hardware, including the advanced resistance exercise device (ARED) and 2nd generation treadmill (T2) are designed to provide astronauts with the ability to exercise at higher intensity. This opens an array of new possibilities for exercise programming in long-duration spaceflight. While the ability to do resistance exercises at heavier loads, the ability to run faster and potentially with more body loading are obvious improvements in exercise capabilities, the details of how this new equipment should be used are not so obvious. Therefore the purpose of this research is to evaluate the efficacy of a new integrated resistance and aerobic training ( SPRINT ) program designed to minimize loss of muscle, bone and cardiovascular function during ISS missions. Specific Aims: 1) Develop an evidence -based approach to maintain physiological function while simultaneously decreasing total exercise time and volume by development of a novel exercise prescription for use on ISS. The exercise regimen will use higher intensity resistance exercises and interval aerobic exercise according to the Intramural and extramural experts convened for two workshops held in 2008: the NASA Muscle Workshop in June 2008 and the NASA International Space Station Exe rcise Prescription Workshop in October 2008. 2) Include an increase in the intensity and a reduction in the volume of resistance exercises, include very short, but high intensity interval -type aerobic exercises, and start the exercise countermeasures as early as possible in the flight, preferably in the first week. Methodology : Pre-, in - and post -flight testing, and data sharing with selected on-going medical assessment tests, will be used to assess the effectiveness of this candidate prescription. Tests include detailed measurements of lower body muscle structure and function (MRI, ultrasound, muscle performance testing, shared muscle medical tests), maximal aerobic capacity, ventilatory threshold, left ventricular mass and cardiac contractility and bone mineral density. Twenty (20) long duration crew members will be recruited as active subjects in SPRINT ; and 20 will be asked to serve as controls that perform the standard care exercise prescription and the pre-post flight testing. This task is expected to validate an exercise regimen effective at mitigating physiological decline in space and preserving human performance capacity in crewmembers serving on long-duration missions. This task would close the gap by providing an operationally effective countermeasure to the reduction in musculoskeletal deconditioning during spaceflight This task is referenced under the Risk of Impaired Performance Due to Reduced Muscle Mass, Strength and Endurance - see gaps M7, M8, M9 and M10 Deliverables: during spaceflight.

Our novel approach involves quantifying typical daily loads to the lower extremities in selected free-living volunteer subjects who are moderate exercisers and design individual exercise prescriptions based on Daily Load Stimulus theor y. Specific Aims: Determine if individualized mechanical load replacement and supplementation during bed rest can serve as a countermeasure to losses in BMD, bone quality, and muscle atrophy during 12 weeks of bed rest. Methodology : Quantify typical daily loads to the lower extremities in selected free-living volunteer subjects who are not habitual exercisers and planning individual exercise prescriptions based on daily load stimulus theory where existing mathematical theories on daily load stimulus (DLS) have been modified to incorporate new theories on saturation and recovery of the osteogenic potential of bone with distributed mechanical loading and the effects of standing. . Randomize subjects to control or exercise groups and confined to 6- degree h ead-down bed rest for 12 weeks. The exercise group will undergo individualized daily exercise programs in the unique Zero Gravity Locomotion Simulator (ZLS) designed to replace their daily mechanical load stimulus experienced during free living. A treadmill and a resistance-exercise device will be used for exercise. DXA, MRI, and QCT scans will be conducted at the start and end of bed rest to assess variations in bone mineral density, changes in muscle volume, and regional changes (cortical vs. trabecular) in bone. Strength measurements will be collected pre- and post-bed rest, and urinary and serum markers of bone resorption and formation will also be assessed. Dietary intake sufficient to maintain constant body weight with a balanced intake of macro - and micronutrients will be planned and supervised by a registered dietician. This task is expected to provide a categorical answer to the question of whether intermittent load replacement can adequately protect the musculoskeletal system against hypokinetic ost eopenia and muscle atrophy and validate the use of individualized exercise prescriptions as a countermeasure to musculoskeletal deconditioning This task will fill or partially fill the gap by directing the prescription/design of an exercise countermeasure based upon DBLS. Deliverables: Technology or Tool_Clinical Care/Medical Informatics A methodology by which individualized exercise prescriptions can be developed to mitigate musculoskeletal decline in crewmembers. At the end of this study a decision must be made whether or not to pursue this exercise model. Required Delivery Milestone: This task mitigates a risk to a long -duration Mars mission.

Specific Aims: 1) Complete hardware specification and development, prototype fabrication and faci lity (NASA Glenn Research Center) readiness (including fabrication of support hardware to meet scientific endpoints). 2) Demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the approach in 1g, in 1/6g in the eZLS, and in the 1/6g lunar bed rest analog while typical lunar activities are being performed based upon NASA's Functional Task Test protocol. Methodology : The aDLS (Accelerometric Daily Load Sensor) is composed of a small shoe-mounted unit that will transmit signals to a portable data logger that could pot entially be used to collect data on other physiological systems simultaneously. On -board software with visual feedback will determine how much additional exercise is required each day to maintain bone homeostasis. This system will be tested in the enhanced Zero Gravity Locomotion Simulator (eZLS) at NASA Glenn Research Center and the lunar bed rest analog at UTMB. This task is expected to generate accurate and detailed ambulatory activity monitoring system that can quantify the mechanical loading to the skeleton as the result of physical activity. This task will fill or partially fill the gap by providing a technology/method by which loading activity can be measured and be correlated to skeletal changes and provide biofeedback as to how much loading activ ity is required to maintain skeletal mass and thus prevent a reduction in bone strength.

It is, however, likely that without countermeasures there will be adaptive changes in muscle strength, bone mineral density, bone geometry, and sensorimotor status. When the combined effects of these changes are consider ed in the context of the construction and exploration tasks that will be performed at the lunar base or at other lunar sites, the risk of injury secondary to a fall is likely to be elevated. Specific Aims: 1) Construct an exercise device that integrates aerobic, neurovestibular and resistive training in a compact design to fit the requirements for installation in a planetary base or landing module. 2) Conduct an exercise training study to demonstrate that cardiovascular and resistive exercise on the comb ined exercise device could improve measures of muscle strength and endurance in the 1 -g environment. 3) Integrate the balance training component to the combined countermeasure device and develop an exercise regimen of aerobic exercise, neurovestibular training and resistive exercises aimed at reducing fall risk and proximal femoral bone loss by loading the hip and leg. 4) Conduct an experiment at the UTMB Flight Analog Research Unit where human test subjects (n=30, 15 Males, 15 females), with age, height and BMI representative of the astronaut corps, are randomized into intervention (integrated countermeasure regimen) and control (no exercise) groups in the spaceflight analog. The aim of the experiment is to validate the ability of the combined exercise device to significantly reduce the risk for fall and subsequent injury by maintaining pre -bed rest physiological status. Methodology: Validate device efficacy by using pre- and post - bed rest with QCT and MRI scanning, muscle strength testing, and assays of serum bone turnover markers to minimize adaptive changes in musculoskeletal physiology and neurovestibular status. This task is expected to deliver an effective exercise hardware validated in a flight analog. This task will fill or partially fill the gap by mitigating musculoskeletal decline and reducing the risk of injury due to falling. Deliverables: Countermeasure_Prototype Hardware Exercise hardware.

Specific Aims: 1) Optimize an exercise training program that combines dynamic and intermittent resistive exercise [RE] to prevent cardiovascular atrophy and deconditioning associated with prolonged bed rest. 2) Combine the dynamic plus RE training program with potassium - magnesium -citrate supplementation to attenuate the increased risk for stone formation, and to diminish bed rest -induced bone los s to a greater extent than exercise training or supplementation alone. 3) Evaluate the efficacy of the dynamic plus RE training program to preserve muscle force and endurance by attenuating structural and functional alterations in skeletal muscle induced b y prolonged bed rest. Methodology : Perform exercise countermeasure with rowing ergometry to obtain most intensive cardiac hypertrophy in the shortest time period in combination with RE. The impact of cardiac changes on orthostatic intolerance will be determined by classical, invasive cardiovascular physiology to measure the static component of diastole (Frank-Starling and LV pressure/volume curves) in conjunction with innovative, non-invasive imaging techniques to measure the dynamic component of diastole. A novel oral volume loading strategy will also be applied just prior to testing for orthostatic intolerance. Urinary calcium excretion, bone resorption and urinary renal stone formation as well as, ultrasound evaluation of bone mass and material propert y, will be evaluated to assess the effect of integrated exercise regimen on skeletal health risks. Muscle size and function will be assessed by MRI/spectroscopy, functional exercise testing (strength and endurance), biochemistry (enzyme activity, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway induction) and histology (muscle fiber type and morphometry, and capillary density). This task is expected to generate a countermeasure that is cross-cutting for physiological deconditioning in space.

There is a high likelihood for success in predicting the extent of bone loss from dietary intake patterns among astronauts during space flight given that this concept is strongly anchored in previous ground- based data from our laboratory and others. The notion of manipulating diet to minimize bone loss could also have significant social and economic impacts for NASA and for the general public - especially given the increasing trends for diets that are high in animal protein and low in frui ts and vegetables. Specific Aim : Document how the ratio of acid to base precursors in the diet is related to directional changes in markers of bone resorption and formation during flight and recovery from flight. Methodology : Dietary intake and body mas s are monitored during these long-duration (4 to 6- month) missions This task is expected to generate a dietary countermeasure for bone loss that has no associated risks for side effects, no requirement for payload mass, and no additional crew time necessar y during flight.

Deliverables: Risk Characterization_Evidence; Standards_Update; ISS for validation Task: Testosterone and Leucine Supplementation as Gender Specific Countermeasures against Musculoskeletal Losses during Space Exploration This task is also described under - Risk for Bone Fracture, B15 B10: How can skeletal adaptation be monitored to a) determine whether there is a plateau in bone loss, b) describe gender effects, and c) reflect changes in bone turnover/calcium kinetics? Although the degree of loss in bone mineral density over the duration of ISS missions is not of great concern for fracture risk during a mission in low earth orbit, the actual rate at which these losses occur is not known, and it is not currently possible to predict what losses will occur during a Mars mission. Therefore, as new state - of-the-art techniques become available, in -flight monitoring of bone metabolism (i.e., changes to both bone mineral density [BMD] and bone quality and their translation to bone strength) should be examined on Shuttle, ISS and during Lunar Sortie and Lunar Outpost missions . It is critical to acquire these data, for a better description of skeletal adaptation, in order to direct future countermeasure research more efficiently. HRP -47065 REV B 473 Task: Develop ultrasound to monitor bone changes in -flight. Short Title : Ultrasound bone quality Responsible Organization: ExMC Supporting Organization: HHC//NxPCM Funding Source : NSBRI/ Directed ** Other gaps supported by this task: B10 Introduction: Early diagnostic technology that can predict fracture risk is critical to prophylactic interventio ns for osteoporosis. New methods in quantitative ultrasound (QUS) have emerged with the potential to estimate the modulus of cancellous bone (aka trabecular bone) more directly. The primary advantage of ultrasonic techniques is that it can also measure a mechanical property of bone (as a bone quality measure) besides bone density. Scanning confocal acoustic diagnostic (SCAD) system is capable of generating acoustic images at the regions of interest (e.g., in the calcaneus) with strong correlations to bone's material properties as determined by SCAD and microCT [BMD (R=0.87) and yield strength (R=0.9)] in both animal and human trials. The objectives of this study are to further develop this unique diagnostic for use in the human, with improved resolution, faster scan times (e.g., < 5 min for the calcaneus), the ability to scan multiple sites of the skeleton, and to validate image based characterization of bone's physical properties to true bone quality as based on material testing. Specific Aim : 1) Bone surface topology via acoustic surface mapping for accurately measuring wave velocity will be determined. 2) Extracted trabecular BUA and UV images at multiple skeletal sites, i.e., calcaneus, wrist, and hip, will be further developed to provide direct asse ssment of bone loss and fracture risk. 3) Validate by microCT and mechanical testing, as well as, nanoindentation, bone's structural and strength properties, as measured by SCAD, in cadaver specimens and 4) Perform by clinical assessment on osteoporosis subjects using both SCAD and DXA. This work will help to refine a non-invasive diagnostic for bone loss, and may potentiate the development of a flight instrument for the precise determination of bone quality during extended space missions. Methodology: Bone 3d surface topology mapping and its role in trabecular bone quality will be assessed using scanning confocal ultrasound for accurate calculation of ultrasound wave velocity. Automatic region of interests will be identified based on the ultrasound broad band attenuation. Complete ultrasound non-invasive assessment for bone quality in bed resting subjects. Initiate SCAD assessment in large and critical bone sites, e.g., proximal femur. This task is shared with ExM C in use of research data to inform re quirements for bone monitoring device. This task is expected to validate a technology that can quantify bone mass and structural stiffness, is simple, inexpensive, non-invasive and free of ionizing radiation, and can provide information about the integrity of the trabecular bone microstructure for skeletal sites in the peripheral skeleton This task will fill or partially fill the gap by providing a technology that can be developed further as flight hardware for monitoring bone health and for application to sites of the central skeleton. This capability can be employed by other Elements (ExMC and Medical Operations; and HHC for countermeasure research) to address both Risks for Early Onset Osteoporosis, and for Fracture. Deliverables: Technology_Systems Solutions/Prototype Hardware SCAD prototype, at TRL 5, will be a real-time, high -resolution, portable bone image modality for determining bone quality.

Non - invasive technologies that are sensitive enough to monitor morphological changes are emerging; but technology demonstration for key weight -bearing sites (hip and spine) currently do not currently exist. Specific aims: 1) Identify candidate technologies (preferably not based on ionizing radiation) at the TRL 4 -5 to developed into TRL 6 to provide gold standard measurements used to define a clinical metric to which bone needs to be protected in space (i.e., permissible outcome). Requirements: a) Measured parameters should correlate well to gold standard measures (e.g., QCT, microCT and bone histomorphometry). b) Imaging capability is desired but not mandatory. c) Technology should demonstrate good precision and sensitivity and should not employ ionizing radiation since temporal changes will require multiple serial measures. d)Tests should be: a) readily available (e.g., retrofitted to existing clinical machines) and not be limited to specialized instrumentation; b) relatively fast; a nd c) capable of assessing multiple skeletal sites particularly the hip and spine. Methodology : TBD This task is expected to yield a technology to determine effect sizes of 6 -month spaceflight on bone structure(s), and the temporal changes over prolonged mechanical unloading in flight analog experiments. This task will fill or partially fill the gap by providing a more complete assessment of bone strength independent of BMD determined by DXA through its measures of structure(s); providing a clinical threshold to which bone health should be monitored in flight and providing direction for the development appropriate countermeasures to mitigate reductions in bone strength. In-flight capability (ExMC) for monitoring Bone Health during space missions beyond low -earth orbit first requires a technology to measure parameters accurately in ground experiments, or with pre - and post-flight application. Need to describe temporal changes to bone structure over prolonged periods of mechanical unloading (along with correlations to bone strength) to identify a morphological \"trigger\" development) Description of deliverables Technology provides the tool to define the changes to bone strength due to spaceflight and to substantiate for reduced bone strength and to assess countermeasure efficacy; this definition may update standards for flight certification and permissible outcomes; Required Delivery Milestone: Required Platforms: ground, analog; ground, pre - post-ISS missions Task: Non -invasive Technology for Assessing Bone Structure for Multiple Skeletal Sites Risk o f Bone Fracture - Gap B29 HRP -47065 REV B 475 Task: Rapid measurements of bone loss using tracer -less calcium isotope analysis of blood and urine Short Title : Calcium Isotope Study Responsible Organization: HHC/NxPCM Supporting Organization: Funding gaps supported by this task: N5 Introduction: This task will develop a method to rapidly detect changes in bone mineral balance by measuring the natural (i.e., tracer -less) isotope composition of calcium in blood and/or urine. This method would provide a way to detect incipient bone loss before changes in bone density are detectable by conventional X -ray methods. Specific Aims : 1) Determine how quickly changes in skeletal loading produces detectable changes in urinary and blood Ca isotope composition, 2) Begin to estimate how these changes vary between individuals. 3) Resolve diurnal changes and other variations in urinary and blood Ca isotope composition., we will be able to 4) Reconstruct the isotopic composition of each subjects' dietary Ca on a meal by meal basis (by measuring the isotopic composition of all dietary items containing significant Ca and obtaining the detailed records of what each subject ate), and 5) Disentangle the dietary signal in urinary and blood Ca isotope composition from the endogenous physiological signal that reflects changes in bone mineral balance. Methodology : Precise measurements of the calcium isotope composition in blood or urine provide information about bone mineral balance because the isotopic composition of calcium in human soft tissues is naturally affected by the relative rates of bone formation and resorption. Specifically, lighter calcium isotopes are preferentially incorporated into bone during formation. Because of the short residence time of calcium in soft tissues, calcium isotope ratios should change rapidly in response to changes bone gain or loss. These changes, while small, can be measured by multiple collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC -ICP-MS) or thermal ionization mass spectrometry ( TIMS). This sampling protocol will generate approximately 1750 urine, blood and food samples focusing on two periods of intensive sampling, per void sampling of urine and sub daily sampling of blood during times when bone mineral balance can be expected to change rapidly (during the first week of bed rest and the first week of recovery). This task is expected to generate a validated technology (analysis) for detecting the progression of spaceflight -induced bone loss and a response to therapy for bone loss: a test that will accelerate the pace of evaluating countermeasure efficacy for spaceflight - induced bone loss and for metabolic bone diseases such as osteoporosis. The task will partially fill the gap by providing a test with which to evaluate the effica cy of bone countermeasures with earlier detection than with technologies assessing bone mass, as well as a potential technique for development as an in-flight bone health monitor precluding the requirement for sample return and separate assays for biomarkers of bone resorption and bone formation.

Short Title : Sweat Responsible Organization : HHC Supporting Organization: NxPCM Funding Source : NRA Other gaps supported by this task: B10 Introduction: this task will that the rate and extent of unloading -induced bone loss in humans can be assessed by monitoring the levels of two bone resorption markers in sweat, namely calcium and collagen breakdown products. One of the approaches tested will be a novel, micro -fabricated fluid collection capillary array, known as the micro-fabricated sweat patch (MSP) device, specifically developed for use in microgravity. Specific Aims : This task will 1) assess the rate and extent of unloading-induced bone loss in humans by monitoring the levels of two bone resorption markers in sweat, namely ionized calcium and collagen break -down products and 2) te st three populations (at rest and during activity) that have different constitutive levels of bone remodeling, namely young normal healthy individuals, air -force cadets undergoing regular heavy resistance training and healthy elderly individuals. All groups will include both male and female participants. Methodology: Several different sweat collection techniques will be investigated to determine the most appropriate and efficient means of sample collection suitable for deployment during a space flight mission. Biomarker concentration will be determined in contemporaneous samples of sweat, blood and urine collected during both short (24 hr) and long-term studies (six months) to define the relationship between biomarkers levels in the respective biological samples. Bone mineral density (BMD) measures will be incorporated in the long-term studies to test the predictive value of sweat biomarkers with regard to overall bone remodeling. Future testing will utilize subjects undergoing bed -rest simulations of micro- or partial gravity loading conditions. This task is expected yield a biomarker analysis technique that allow for future deployment in micro - or partial gravity environments.

HRP -47065 REV B 478 Task: Extent, Causes, and Countermeasures of Impaired Fracture Healing in Hypogravity Short Title : Fracture healing Responsible Organization: HRP/ExMC Supporting Organization: ExMC Funding Source : supported by this task: ExMC 4.06 Introduction: Lunar missions will expose astronauts to continuous hypogravity and strenuous mission tasks for which there is a likelihood of accidental fractures. The healing of fibular fractures in hind limb unloaded (HLU) rats is observed to be delayed leading to a sig nificant number of non-unions, and associated with a substantially reduced number of marrow-derived osteoprogenitor cells. This task will further investigate the scope and extent of bone healing, some countermeasures to augment bone healing responses, and whether impaired fracture healing would extend to more clinically relevant closed femoral fractures. Specific Aims : 1) Determine the scope and extent of femoral fracture healing impairment, 2)Determine the underlying biological causes of the impairment, 3) Develop countermeasures to prevent fracture healing impairment, and 4) Determine whether current Earth -based clinical procedures will reverse severely delayed fracture healing situations resulting from hypogravity. Methodology : HLU rats will undergo closed femoral fractures and healing will be assessed using (a) micro -CT bone imaging to evaluate hard callus structure, (b) hard callus strength via torsion testing, (c) callus tissue composition using histomorphometry, (d) colony forming unit assessments of marrow - derived osteoprogenitor cell numbers, and (e) measurements of osteoinductive, chondrogenic and angiogenic factor expression during early healing periods. This task is expected to define the risk for impaired fracture healing in hypogravity and explore mechanisms of pharmaceuticals enhancement of this impaired healing. This task will fill or partially fill the gap by providing preliminary data that cannot be obtained with safely and ethically in clinical investigations.

HRP -47065 REV B 480 B11: What are the effects of radiation on bone? Task : Space Radiation and Bone Loss: Lunar Outpost Mission Critical Scenarios and Countermeasures Short Title : SR Bone Loss Responsible Organization: HHC Supporting Organization: NA Funding Source : NSBRI Other gaps supported by this task: Introduction: Crews on exploratory missions will face complex radiation from cosmic and solar sources with components ranging from protons to iron. We have identified trabecular bone loss in mice after exposure to multiple radiation types with doses ranging from 0.5 Gy to 2 Gy, suggesting space radiation may increase bone loss from reduced gravity during exploratory missions. The bone loss is rapid and initiated by an early activation of osteoclasts. The impact of radiation on bone quality and fracture healing in reduced gravity is unknown, and must be studied to understand effects of sp ace radiation on bone health. The long-term objective of the proposed research is the development of countermeasures to prevent bone loss during missions and thus reduce fracture risk. To define the risks associated with space radiation -induced bone loss, the proposed aims will examine effects of modeled space radiation using scenarios applicable for Lunar Outpost missions: Specific Aim 1: Examine the combined effects of a modeled solar particle event and unloading on bone, and subsequent recovery during reloading. Hypothesis: Proton radiation with unloading will induce a more severe bone loss than unloading alone. Specific Aim 2: Examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms for initiating bone loss following exposure to several types of modeled space radiation, including acute proton exposure, low -dose -rate proton exposure, and mixed radiation types (proton and HZE). Understanding underlying molecular causes is critical to developing countermeasures for radiation -induced bone loss. Hypothesis: The initia ting mechanism of bone loss is initiated by osteoclast activation caused by a radiation -induced inflammatory response. Specific Aim 3: Test the efficacy of three countermeasures for bone loss caused by proton exposure: 1) the bisphosphonate risedronate; 2) the RANKL and 3) an antioxidant agent, alpha -lipoic acid. Hypothesis: Potent inhibitors of bone resorption, both zoledronate and osteoprotegerin will prevent the bone loss caused by radiation. Antioxidants will address m ultiple radiation-induced problems; alpha -lipoic acid decreases osteoclast differentiation and activity. Deliverables: Risk Characterization/Evidence and Countermeasures Information regarding the combined effects of radiation and spaceflight on bone and of pharmacological countermeasures to those effects. Required Delivery Milestone: This task mitigates a risk to a long -duration Martian or lunar missions. Required Platforms: This is a ground- based study using mouse models. HRP -47065 REV B 481 Task: Maintaining Musculoskeletal Health in the Lunar Environment Short Title : Musculoskeletal Health Responsible Organization: HHC Supporting Organization: NA Funding Source : NSBRI Other gaps supported by this task: B1c Introduction: It is well documented that the human b ody loses bone and muscle mass during long- duration stays in space such as on the International Space Station. With the United States planning to conduct long- duration missions to the moon, scientists must learn what effects lunar gravity, which is one-sixth of Earth's, will have on human muscle and bone. This study is an animal model study to determine if muscle and bone loss on the moon will be as severe as it is in microgravity. The project also seeks to determine if low-dose radiation exposure worsens bone and muscle loss in a lunar -gravity environment and if, under these unique conditions, exercise is still effective in reducing bone and muscle loss. Specific Aims: 1) Does partial weight bearing (~1/6 g) mitigate losses observed with full unloadin g (~ 0 g)? 2) Does low -dose radiation exposure change the bone or muscle response to partial gravity? Methodology : Simulate the additional load bearing incurred by crew members locomoting on the Lunar surface due to the weight of EVA spacesuits; this is easily accommodated by our partial g mouse model, since weight bearing can be titrated to whatever fraction of 100% body weight is desired. Conduct a dose -response study utilizing reference x-ray radiation to assess responses of bone and muscle at early (~3 days), \"delayed\" (~21 days) and \"recovery\" (~56 days) time points. Use 108 mice (12 groups of 9 each) to test responses at the 3 time points listed above at 3 different radiation exposures. Test the effects of x -ray exposure on the response to simulated partial gravity; in this experiment, mice subjected to 1/3 g (and weight bearing control mice) will be exposed to one acute dose of x-ray (low LET) radiation as well as 3 fractionated doses. Results of Experiment 2 will also be critical to constructing a beam time proposal for a repetition of Experiment 3 at Brookhaven National Lab during Year 3 of this project. This task is expected to describe the impact of partial weight -bearing on the loss of muscle and bone tissue and to provide unique and novel data that describe the effect of chronic exposure to low -dose radiation on musculoskeletal structure and function. This task will partially close the Gap by describing effects of radiation and describing bone loss in a fractional gravity environment in an anim al model. Deliverables: Technology or Tool_Tool/Simulations Information regarding the putative protective effect of fractional gravity and the effects of radiation. Required Delivery Milestone: This task mitigates a risk to a long -duration Mars mission.

Risk Context While hazard control systems and processes prevent the presence of many medically significant microorganisms during spaceflight missions, potentially pathogenic organisms could be carried by crewmembers, the spacecraft, and its cargo; thus, microbial infection of crewmembers cannot be completely prevented. Recent evidence from spaceflight experiments also suggests alterations in microbial characteristics, including virulence (disease causing potential), in organisms grown during flight. In combination with potential host susceptibility due to dysfunction in the immune system, infectious disease risk may be greater than in the spaceflight environment than in normal workplace settings. Operational Relevance Negative impacts from microorganisms during space flight are not uncommon; but major consequences to crew health and performance fortunately have been infrequent compared to the general public. Because consequences of infectious disease could include loss of mission and loss of crew, recent findings that spaceflight can increase virulence of microorganisms indicates that the extent of the risk of adverse health effects due to infectious disease or allergic response may be greater than previously expected. Therefore additional characterization of the determinant of infectious disease in long duration missions is imperative if mitigation strategies are to be sufficiently robust to ensure crew health and mission success . Strategy for Mitigation To mitigate the risk of adverse health effects due to alterations in host -microorganism interactions a thorough characterization of its determinants will be conducted to secure a basis for requirements that are necessary to effectively address the risk. Toward that end, information from data mining and a NASA Flight Experiment is being obtained and contributing to the development of a systematic microbiological risk assessment. The identification of knowledge gaps identified by this approach, as well as recommendations from both a HRP Workshop on Spaceflight Alterations in Host -Microorganism Interactio ns and a HRP Standing Review Panel, a strategy has been developed to gain the knowledge necessary to achieve the stated objective. This approach refines the original gap so that four new gaps provide the organization concepts that collect the tasks that address the risk. The gaps examine the changes in the microorganisms , changes in human host, changes in microbe -host interactions, and efficiency of current countermeasures against microbial associated risks during human exploration of space that could affect crew health.

Extensive monitoring efforts are performed prior to and during flight; however, current methodology is limited and may miss several pathogens that could affect crew health and performance. The SWAB flight experiment uses advanced collection and processing techniques to identify pathogens in the spaceflight environment that could not be identified using current spaceflight operational methodology. Specific Aims: 1. Comprehensively evaluate microbes on board the space station, including pathogens (organisms that may cause disease). 2. Track changes in the microbial community as spacecraft visit the station and new station modules are added. Methods: 1 & 2 New collection techniques have been developed to improve the quality of the sample being returned from ISS for analysis. Air samples are being collected through a novel gelatin filter to improve col lection efficiency. These filters can retain particles as small as viruses. Water and surface samples have been designed to improve DNA recovery using a DNA preservative. Analysis of the in -flight samples will focus around molecular techniques. These include bacterial fingerprinting, bacterial and fungal ribosomal identification, and quantitative PCR to identify and enumerate specific genes in environmental samples. The samples returned from flight will also be evaluated using denaturing gradient gel electr ophoresis. The information from this experiment is used to decrease uncertainty in the Microbial Risk Assessment. Deliverables: Risk Characterization/quantification_Evidence SWAB flight experiment data.

Risk Context Current lunar sortie and habitat operations include EVA activities, the collection of lunar rocks and soil, and possibly the use of this material in 'in situ' experiments. While the lunar design architecture is not finalized, current design suggests crew exposure to airborne lunar dust is highly likely. The nominal toxicity expected from ordinary mineral dust may be increased for lunar dust by the large and reactive surfaces of the dust grains. Human exposures to mineral dusts during industrial operations and from volcanic eruptions give us some sense of lunar dust toxicity, although the earth-based analogs have serious limitations. Animal and cellular studies provide further evidence that mineral dusts can be somewhat toxic. Earth -based research of mineral dust has shown that freshly fractured surfaces are reactive and elicit an increased toxic response. Since lunar dust is formed in space vacuum from highly energetic processes, we expect the grain surf aces to be reactive indefinitely until the dust is brought into a habitable environment. Lunar dust is characterized as fine, charged and reactive dust capable of entering habitats and vehicle compartments, where it can threaten crewmember health. Test ing is critical for the determination of lunar dust toxicity in order to set a permissible exposure limit and risk criteria. Research areas should include characterization of lunar dust size distribution, grain morphology, chemical reactivity, the mode of activation and passivation of surfaces, toxicity to the respiratory system, and ocular irritancy and abrasiveness, and cellular -level toxicity. Health effects from chronic exposure to lunar dust may lead to irreversible compromised pulmonary function and possible organ damage outside the lung through relocation of toxic nano-scale particulates. Acute health effects include ocular irritation and abrasion that might impair crew vision, and dermal abrasion that might impair crew performance. Operational Relevance Assessment & Recommendations The risk to human health from exposure to lunar dust was identified during the Apollo missions, when lunar dust introduced into the lunar lander and command module, resulted in direct exposure and reports of irritation to the eyes, skin, and respiratory system. NASA's plans for the return to the lunar surface include extravehicular activities (EVA) that are more extensive than those during the Apollo missions. The increased duration and frequency of exposure to lunar dust expected during the return missions requires that NASA set a permissible exposure limit for respirable lunar dust. Inhalation, and dermal and ocular abrasions are potential consequences of exposure to lunar dust that can be minimized through opera tional procedures, i.e., post-EVA clean up in airlocks, temporary use of breathing apparatus during cleaning of EVA suits and equipment, and isolation of contaminated suits from respirable environments, and by incorporation of appropriate filters within environmental control and life support systems. The stringency required of processes and systems utilized to mitigate the risks to skin and eyes will be determined by studies that will characterize the abrasiveness of lunar dust. HRP -47065 REV B 515 Strategy for Mitigation Lunar dust has properties that raise concerns for human health. Lunar dusts have a high content of respirable size particles, have high surface areas that are chemically reactive, and \"nano - particles\" of highly reactive elemental iron (Fe0) are imbedded in a \" rind\" at the surfaces of the particles. These unusual properties may cause the respirable dust to be at least moderately toxic to the respiratory system, and the larger grains to be abrasive to the skin and eye. NASA needs to set a permissible exposure lim it (PEL) for airborne lunar dusts that is based on scientific evidence so that designs of vehicles and habitats will include features that restrain concentrations of airborne dust within safe limits. Operations must be designed to minimize the risk of abra sion to skin and eyes. On earth, under some conditions, some mineral dusts are highly toxic to the human respiratory system, but it is unclear whether exposure to lunar dust will be more or less harmful. Research into the toxicity of lunar dust will provi de an evidence base to set exposure standards, which are needed to safely manage exposures in lunar habitats and vehicles. Knowledge required to mitigate the potential health risks associated with exposure to lunar dust and formulate a scientifically sound and defensible permissible limit for exposure to respirable lunar dust is incomplete. The Lunar Airborne Dust Toxicity Assessment Group (LADTAG) has been created and utilized to provide expert advice regarding the identification and definition of gaps an d the research that would be required to effectively address each gap. The ability of the proposed research to address the risk has been evaluated by a Standing Review Panel (SRP) that evaluated the extent to which the risk was addressed by the formulations of the Gaps and the appropriateness and potential effectiveness of tasks that have been proposed to remediate the deficiencies in knowledge defined by the gaps. The research plan described below, which reflects the council of the LADTAG and SRP, will permit us to gain adequate knowledge to ensure risk mitigation strategies are appropriate. Gaps AEH 1: What are the unique properties of lunar dust that affect physiology? Lunar dust particles are unlike terrestrial dusts. Lunar dusts are known to have a high surface area and other distinctive shape and chemical characteristics. Task: Geology, Geochemistry and Lithology Science Support Activities Short Title : Lunar Dust - Geology Responsible Organization: SHFH/AEHP Supporting Organization: N/A Funding Source: AEH 2; AEH 4, AEH 5, AEH 11 The objective of this task is to obtain samples and physically characterize samples of authentic lunar HRP -47065 REV B 516 dust that are to be used in toxicology studies. Specific Aims: 1. Secu re from the Curator and Planning Team for Extraterrestrial Materials (CAPTEM) samples of lunar dust. 2. Develop a dry method for separating respirable size particles from the samples of authentic native dust. 3. Develop a protocol for producing respirable size particles by grinding courser lunar dust 4. Determine mass median aerodynamic diameters and mineralogy of the respirable lunar dust samples. Methods: 1. Application for samples with supporting justification will be submitted to CAPTEM 2. A fractionation system emp loying a sample bed fluidized with dry nitrogen, and separation of suspended particles via elutriation, will be optimized by adjusting configuration of components, pressure, flow rates, etc., to achieve separation of respirable size particles from bulk sample of dust. 3. Various grinding methods, ball mills, jet mills, cyclones, etc will be evaluated for ability to produce particles with aerodynamic diameters in the respirable range. The geology, geochemistry and lithology science support activities will pr ovide samples of respirable lunar dust that will be required by chemistry and toxicology studies. Deliverables: Technology or Tool_Tools/Simulations; Risk Characterization/ quantification_Evidence The deliverables includes securing samples of authentic lu nar dusts from CAPTEM, development of appropriate methods for separating respirable size particles from the samples of authentic native dust and developing protocols for producing additional respirable size particles required by toxicology and chemistry st udies by grinding courser lunar dust by a method that will serve as a good fidelity analog for the commutation that produces dust on the surface of the moon. This task also includes characterizations of the size distribution, morphology and mineralogy of l unar dust samples. Required Delivery Milestones: FY10 Samples of authentic lunar dust obtained from CAPTEM Method for separation of respirable size particles from samples of lunar dust. Grinding protocol for production of respirable size particles from courser particles of lunar dust. Characterization of size distribution, morphology and mineralogy of lunar dust samples. FY 11 All tasks must be completed in sufficient time to allow delivery of the PEL to the Office of the Chief Health and Medical Officer (OCHMO) in December of 2010 (FY11) Required Platforms: Ground facilities Acquisition of archived samples, development of methods to separate, and to produce respirable size particles of lunar dusts, and the characterizations of particle size, morphol ogy and mineralogy of the dust are ground-based efforts. Task: Dust Size Factor Studies Short Title: Dust Factor Study Responsible Organization: SHFH/AEHP Supporting Organization: N/A Funding Source: Directed by this task: AEH 5 HRP -47065 REV B 517 The objective of this task is to utilize samples of lunar dust collected from upper layer of the soil during the Apollo 16 mission, and dust particles recovered from the suit worn by an Apollo 17 astronaut during extravehicular activities, to obtain data that will further elucidate the physical characteristics of lunar dust. Specific Aims: 1. Determine particles size distribution of dust grains recovered from Apollo artifacts 2. Determine dissolution characteristics of lunar dust. Methods: 1. Samples of lunar dust collected from upper layer of the soil during the Apollo 16 mission via \"clamshell\" sampling devices, and dust particles recovered from the suit worn by an Apollo 17 astronaut during extravehicular activities, will be examined by scanning electron micro scopy to obtain data that will further elucidate the physical characteristics (size distributions, elemental composition) of lunar dust. 2. Dissolution of activated, and passivated, lunar dusts, will carried out by suspending dust in continuously rotated s ample tubes containing solutions buffered at a physiological relevant pH - e.g. blood, macrophage phagosome, etc) and elements released into solution after 3 days will be determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICP -MS). Particles size distribution of Apollo soil samples have relied upon sieving methods and these methods are ineffective in determining prevalence of particles in the respirable range and analysis has been conducted on bulk samples. Analysis of the clamshell samples, which sampled the surface to a depth of 500 microns, an area in which fine dusts are likely to be abundant will provide a characterization of the prevalence of respirable size particles on the lunar surface. Examination of particles recovered from EVA suit will provide an indication of the size of the particles encountered by the crew. Dissolution of dust in the lung is one mechanism by which respired particles may be cleared from the lungs. Identifying the properties of lunar soil in solution (dissolution) will advance our understanding the potential effects of lunar soil on cellular systems of the lungs and pulmonary toxicity. These data contribute to the determination of uncertainty factors that will be used to establish a PEL for airborne lunar dust. Deliverables: Risk Characterization/ quantification_Evidence The deliverables include data that describes the particle size distribution, morphology and mineralogy of samples of dust that were collected from the upper layers of the lunar soil during the Apollo 16 mission by a \"clamshell\" sampling device, and dust particles recovered from a suit worn by an Apollo 17 astronaut during extravehicular activities. Required Delivery Milestones: FY11 All tasks must be completed in sufficient time to allow delivery o f the PEL to OCHMO in December of 2010 (FY11) Required Platforms: Ground facilities Acquisition of archived samples, development of and mineralogy are ground- based methods to separate, and to produce respirable size lunar dusts and the characterizations of particle size, morphology efforts are ground-based efforts. Task: Task: Activation Factor Study Short Title: Activation Study SHFH/AEHP Supporting Source: Directed HRP -47065 REV B 518 Other gaps supported b y this task : AEH 2, AEH 4, AEH 5, AEH 11 The objectives of the activation studies are to obtain data that will be used to determine the value of the Activation Factor that will be utilized in formulating the PEL for airborne lunar dust. Specific Aims: 1. Develop methods that will provide analogs for processes that affect the lunar surface to cause activation of lunar dust, 2. Utilize developed methods to inform estimates of the level of reactivity of dust that will be encountered in the lunar highlands, and rate s of passivation of activated dust when exposed to conditions of air and humidity that are expected in exploration vehicles and habitats. 3. Provided activated lunar samples for use in toxicology and chemistry studies. Methods: 1. Studies of the activation of lu nar dust will utilize analogs of processes that activate dust on the lunar surface to reactivate lunar samples that have been passivated by exposure to air. Grinding will be used as a surrogate for micrometeorite bombardment, hydrogen and helium ion implantation will simulate the effects of solar wind, and lamps will substitute for the sun as sources of ultraviolet radiation. 2. Levels of activation and rates of passivation will be measured by a Terephthalate Assay that measures hydroxyl ions produced by activated dusts when placed in an aqueous solution, and by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, which detects unpaired electron. 3. Activated lunar samples will be packaged in containers under dry, ultrapure nitrogen and double -bagged to prevent passivation of activated sample by exposure to air or humidity, before being distributed for use in chemistry of toxicology studies. Understanding the activation and passivation processes and their mode of action in the human system will determine potential health effects and measures of activation and rates of passivation will be used to determine the value of the activation factor that will be used to establish exposure limits for airborne lunar dust during mission related tasks. Deliverables: Technology or Tool_Tools/Simulations; Risk Characterization/ quantification_Evidence Deliverables include standardized methods that serve as analogs for processes that contribute to activation of dust on the surface of the moon, data that provides a basis for estimating the level of activity of lunar dust and rate at which dust that enters habitable volumes will be passivated, and samples of activated lunar dust that are required for chemistry and toxicology studies. Required Delivery Milestones: FY10 Methods for Activatio n of lunar dusts Distribution of samples of activated lunar dust. FY11 Data that provides a basis for estimating level of reactivity of dust on the surface of the moon and its rate of passivation upon entering a habitable volume All tasks must be complet ed in sufficient time to allow delivery of the PEL to OCHMO in December of 2010 (FY11) Required Platforms: Ground facilities Efforts leading to the development of methods for activation of lunar dust and studies of levels of activation attained and rates of subsequent passivation of the activated dusts, and generation and distribution of samples of activated dust for use in chemistry and toxicology studies are ground based activities. AEH 2: What is the toxicity of lunar dust in the respiratory system? During the Apollo missions' anecdotal evidence of respiratory effects of lunar dust were reported by crewmembers. However, there is no scientifically defensible data with which to assess the toxicity of inhaled lunar dusts. The data to be obtained from the studies described below are therefore essential to determining risk criteria and establishing a permissible exposure limit for airborne lunar dust. HRP -47065 REV B 519 Task: Pulmonary Toxicity Studies of Lunar Dust in Mice and Rats Short Title: Pulmonary Toxicity of Luna r Dust Responsible Organization: SHFH/AEHP Supporting Organization: N/A Funding Source: Directed Other gaps supported by this task: AEH 5 The objective of the pulmonary toxicology studies is to obtain data that will be used to determine values for \"unc ertainty\" factors (dose, species, and activation factors) that will be utilized in establishing the PEL for airborne lunar dust. Specific Aims: 1. Assess pulmonary toxicity of lunar dust in rodents with Intratracheal and Intrapharyngeal studies. 2. Assess pulmon ary toxicity of lunar dust in rodents via inhalation studies. Methods: 1. Various doses of activated and passivated lunar dusts will be installed in rodents and responses, as indicated by changes in values of variables that will be measured in bronchial alveo lar lavage fluids and by gross and histopathology studies of the lungs at various times after installation will be compared to responses elicited at the same intervals after installation of same doses of reference dusts of known toxicity. 2. Inhalation studie s will expose animals to controlled concentrations of lunar dust for six hours a day for five days a week for 4 weeks for a total of 120 hours. Toxicity of doses of lunar dust will be assessed by pulmonary alveolar lavage and gross and histopathological examination of lungs at various intervals after exposure. Toxicity of lunar dust will be assessed relative to published accounts of the values of same measures made in animals exposed to same or similar concentrations of dusts of know toxicity after same intervals of exposure, and further, toxicity will be related to the lung burdens established by the inhaled dusts. Data from these studies will assist in the determination of values of uncertainty factors that will be utilized in establishing PEL for airbo rne lunar dust. Deliverables: Risk Characterization/ quantification_Evidence Deliverables from instillation testing, and inhalation toxicity studies. Biochemical and cellular markers of toxicity measured in bronchial lavage fluids, and scoring in histopathology studies will provide evidence of the degree of toxicity of lunar dust. Required Delivery Milestones: FY10 Data from intratracheal and intrapharyngeal instillation testing. FY11 Data from inhalation toxicity studies. Required Platforms: Ground facilities Pulmonary toxicology studies with lunar dusts will be conducted in various laboratories on the ground. Epidemiological evidence has established associations between exposure to specific types of min eral dusts and particular pulmonary pathologies. A common pathway by which exposure to mineral dusts leads to pathology involves inflammation and fibrosis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important mediators of inflammation. Therefore cellular toxicity of activated and passivated lunar dusts will be evaluated in studies that examine the ability of the respirable size particles to induce formation and release of ROS by cells of the respiratory system and to affect secretion of mediators of inflammation , such as interleukins 6 and 8 and Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha by cultured lung cells. Various assays of cell viability will also be utilized. HRP -47065 REV B 520 Task: Cellular Studies to Support Pulmonary Toxicology Evaluation of Lunar Dust Short Title: Cell Toxicity Testing Responsible Organization: SHFH/AEHP Supporting Organization: N/A Funding Source: Directed Other gaps supported by this task: AEH 5 The objective of the cellular toxicology studies is to obtain data that will be used to determine values for \"uncertainty\" factors (dose, species, and activation factors) that will be utilized in establishing the PEL for airborne lunar dust. Specific Aim: The specific aim is to characterize the production of reactive oxygen species in cells of the respiratory system after exposure to lunar dust and compare this response to those elicited by dusts of know toxicity to provide a measure of the relative toxicity of lunar dust. Methods: Production of reactive oxygen species, a key pathway that is believed to trigger pulmonary toxicity by inhaled particulates, by alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells, the two major targets of terrestrial materials with known toxic effects, will be characterized in animals exposed via intratracheal installation to activated, o r passivated lunar dusts. These findings will be compared to those elicited by positive controls, such as crystalline silica (quartz), and negative controls, such as titanium dioxide. These studies will compliment the Pulmonary Toxicology Studies by provi ding data that will also contribute to the determination of the dose, species, and activation factors that will be utilized in establishing the PEL. Deliverables: Risk Characterization/ quantification_Evidence Deliverables are data and report on finding from in vitro toxicology studies that will compare the effects of activated and passivated lunar dusts to those of reference dusts of know levels of toxicity on production and release of ROS, upon secretion of mediators of inflammation, and viability of cel ls of the lungs. The deliverables will contribute to determination of values of species, dose, and activation factors that will be used in establishing a PEL for airborne lunar dust. Required Delivery Milestones: FY10 Data from studies with cells that compare the toxicity of passivated dusts and dusts activated by grinding. FY11 Data from continuation studies that compare toxicity of passivated dusts and dusts activated by means other than grinding. Required Platforms: Ground facilities Cellular toxic ology studies with lunar dusts will be conducted in various laboratories on the ground. AEH 4: What is the dermal and ocular toxicity of lunar dust? During the Apollo missions crews reported irritation of skin and eyes after exposure to lunar dust. However, there are no data with which to establish the dermal and ocular toxicity of lunar dusts. The determination of the dermal and ocular hazards of lunar dust is necessary to predict and prevent any consequence that could result from insults to the integument or cornea originating from contact with lunar dust during mission operations. HRP -47065 REV B 521 Task: Supporting Organization: N/A Directed Other gaps supported by this task: AEH 5 The objective of the dermal toxicology studies is to characterize the dermal effects of lunar dust. Specific Aim: 1. Assess severity of dermal abrasions that are likely to result from acute and chronic contact of the skin with lunar dust particles. 2. Assess degree to which lunar dust can provoke irritant and sensitization components of inflammation Methods: 1. The abrasive effects of lunar dust on skin will be examined by performing ex vivo tests porcine skin samples, which will measure transepithelial water loss and changes in electrical impedance in skin under controlled conditions with lunar dust, and in vivo tests on paid human subjects. 2. Irritancy testing will utilize tissue -equivalent models, (EpiDerm Irritancy Testing), the Draize irritancy - predictive sensitization test of skin, and the local lymph node assay, which relies on measurement of events induced during the induction phase of skin sensitization. The finding will provide information relevant to developing guidelines for prevent ion, and treatment, respectively, of adverse health effects caused by contact of skin with lunar dust. Deliverables: Risk Characterization/ quantification_Evidence Deliverables are data and reports of the findings of studies that assess ability of lunar dust particles to abrade skin subsequent to acute or chronic contact. It is anticipated that these data and reports will be reviewed by operations personnel and clinicians when developing guidelines for prevention, and treatment, respectively, of adverse health effects caused by contact of skin with lunar dust. Required Delivery Milestones: FY11 All tasks must be completed in sufficient time to allow delivery of the PEL to OCHMO in December of 2010 (FY11) Required Platforms: Ground facilities Dermal studies are ground based activities. Task: Ocular Toxicology Studies Title: Supporting Organization: N/A by this task: AEH 5 HRP -47065 REV B 522 The objective of the oc ular toxicology studies is to assess severity of ocular injuries that are likely to result from acute and chronic contact of the cornea with lunar dust particles. Specific Aim: The specific aim is to assess the severity of ocular damage that could occur fr om acute and chronic contact of the corneum with lunar dust particles. Methods: Irritancy testing will utilize the tissue -equivalent model, EpiOcular Irritancy Test. Draize testing, and histopathology testing would be conducted only if the preliminary studies indicate that the effects of dust extend beyond mechanical irritancy and potential for abrasions and potential for chemical reactivity and corrosive effects are substantiated. Given that such consequences were thought by the Lunar Airborne Toxicology Assessment Group to be unlikely to be associated with a mineral dust, it is possible that the additional tests, which would require sacrifice of the animals, could be avoided. The finding will provide information relevant to developing guidelines for preve ntion, and treatment, respectively, of adverse health effects caused by lunar dust in contact with the corneum. Deliverables: Risk Characterization/ quantification_Evidence Deliverables are data and reports of the findings of studies that assess the abilit y of lunar dust particles to damage tissue equivalent and/or animal models of human cornea subsequent to acute or chronic contact. It is anticipated that these data and reports will be applied by operations personnel and clinicians in the development of guidelines for prevention and treatment, respectively, of ocular injuries caused by lunar dust. Required Delivery Milestones: FY11 All tasks must be completed in sufficient time to allow delivery of the PEL to OCHMO in December of 2010 (FY11) Required Platforms: Ground facilities Ocular studies are ground based activities. AEH 5: What are the permissible exposure limits for inhalation of lunar dust? Data collected from AEH Gaps 1 - 3 will be analyzed to develop a time-based concentration exposure limit for airborne lunar dust. The standard will cover 6 -month episodic exposures, but may include other time-based exposure limits (acute and chronic) contingent upon the availability of data. Task: LADTAG Lunar Dust Health Standard Short SHFH/AEHP Supporting Organization: N/A Funding Source: Directed Other gaps supported by this task: None The objectives of this task is to provide to OCHMO a recommendation for a time -based concentration exposure limit for airborne lunar highlands dust that will cover 6-month episodic exposures and to report finding of studies on dermal and ocular toxicity of lunar dust so that they are available to operations and clinical personnel who will formulate operations procedures and treatment guidelines, to avoid or treat, respectively adverse health effects resulting from exposure to lunar highlands dust. Specific Aim: 1. Determine, and provide to OCHMO, a recommendation for a time- based concentration exposure limit for airborne lunar highlan ds dust that will cover 6 -month episodic exposures. HRP -47065 REV B 523 2. Report finding of studies on dermal and ocular toxicity of lunar dust to Mission Operations, and to those who maintain Human Systems Integration Requirements. Methods: 1. LADTAG will evaluate data derived from studies that address gaps AEH 1 -3, to establish a PEL for airborne lunar highlands dust. LADTAG's formal risk assessment will utilize Bench Mark Dose (BMD) methodology. A BMD, will be established for a selected level of risk (typically 1%, 5% or 10%), and will provides a measure of the effect or risk for that dose. The whole dose response curve is considered in the establishment of a BMD. A BMD, includes measures of variability (confidence limits), is based upon responses obtained in testing rather than upon extrapolation and the method provides consistent means for evaluation across studies. BMD methods are not appropriate when testing minimal doses only, the dose response curve is extremely shallow or doses tested cover a very wide range. If any of these limitations should be found to apply then LADTAG would default to the older No Observable Adverse Effect Limit (NOAEL) method to establish the PEL. 2. Finding from studies that assess dermal or ocular toxicity of lunar dust will be published in repor ts, presented at meeting of professional organizations and/or published in peer -reviewed scientific journals. Summaries of the salient findings and assessments of the significance of these findings will be provided by AEHP to Mission Operations, and to those responsible for maintaining Human Systems Integration Requirements. The deliverable will provide a basis for design requirements for vehicles and habitat, and guidance for the development of operational procedures avoid or treat, adverse health effect s resulting from exposure to lunar highlands dust and to inform treatment guidelines for use in circumstances where preventive measures may are overcome. Deliverables : Standards_Update; Requirements_Flight Rule/MRID/Practice Guidelines Deliverables include recommendations, to be provided to OCHMO, for a time-based concentration exposure limit for airborne lunar highlands dust that will cover 6-month episodic exposures, and reports to Missions Operations and HSIR describing salient findings from studies that assessed dermal and ocular toxicity of lunar dust. Required Delivery Milestones: FY11 Recommendation for an interim PEL is to be provided to OCHMO in December, 2010. Recommendation for a refined PEL is to be provided to OCHMO in September, 2011. Reports to Mission Operations and to HSIR are to be provided in September 2011. Required Platforms: Ground facilities Studies related to the development of the PEL are ground based activities. AEH 11 What is the potential for acute or chronic cardiovascul ar toxicity of lunar dust? Much evidence has been accumulated that demonstrates that the respiratory system is not the only system that experiences deleterious effects as a result of inhalation of particulate matter (PM). A link between PM in air and card iovascular morbidity and mortality has been firmly established (Pope et al, 2004; Scapellato et al, 2007; Walker and Mouton, 2008). Pope (2008)) reported that long-term exposures to PM were most strongly associated with mortality attributable to ischemic heart disease, dysrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest. Oxidative stress initiated in response to inhaled particles is thought to lead to inflammation which in turn stimulates release from lungs into the circulation of pro -inflammatory mediators that promote systemic inflammation that exacerbates or establishes conditions that promote HRP -47065 REV B 524 pathology at sites beyond the lungs (Seaton et al, 1995). More recently, studies with nanoparticles have indicated that effects distal to the lungs may originate locally in response to inhaled PM that has translocated from the lungs (Oberdorster et al., 2002, 2004; Nemmar et al., 2004; Borm et al., 2006; Mossman et al., 2007; Rothen_Ruthishauser et al., 2007), or by PM affecting respiratory reflexes or the autonomic nervous system (Gwin et al., 2006). The observation that inhalation of PM produces adverse effects at sites distal to the lungs, and the possibility that some of these effects may be caused by translocation of PM, particularly ultrafines, from the lungs, s uggests additional gaps in the knowledge that we will require to fully assess the risk of adverse health effects posed by lunar dust. During the meeting of LADTAG in December 2009, it was agreed that future studies should be conducted to assess potential the risk to the cardiovascular system posed by lunar dust. This assessment was seconded by a recommendation received from the Standing Review Panel that AEH include a new gap to assess the potential for acute or chronic cardiovascular toxicity of lunar dust. Gap AEH 11 acknowledges those recommendations. Task: Review and Assess State of Knowledge Regarding the Acute or Chronic Cardiovascular Toxicity of Mineral Dusts, Short Title: Cardiovascular Toxicity of Mineral Dusts - Current State of Knowledge Responsible Organization: SHFH/AEHP Supporting Organization: N/A Funding Source: TBD Other gaps supported by this task: TBD The objective of this task is to summarize and assess the current state of knowledge regarding the toxicity of inhaled or ingeste d mineral dust and identify specific tasks that must be accomplished to address any deficiencies in knowledge that are necessary to assess potential acute and chronic cardiovascular toxicity of lunar dust. Specific Aims: 1. Determine the state of knowledge regarding acute or chronic cardiovascular toxicity of mineral dusts. 2. Identify tasks that must be accomplished to provide information needed to assess the risk to the cardiovascular system that is posed by inhalation or ingestion of lunar dust. 3. Secure the research efforts required to address the identified deficiencies in knowledge required to assess the toxicity of lunar dust to the cardiovascular system. Methods 1.

AEH Watch Item/NSBRI Research: What are the effects of lunar gravity on permissible exposure limits for inhalation of lunar dust? Task: Aerosol Deposition in the Lung in Fractional Gravity: Risk Mitigation for Lunar and Martian Habitats Short Title: Aerosol Deposition Responsible Organization: SHFH/AEHP by this task: AEH 2, AEH 5 The objectives of these studies are to develop better models for assessing environmental exposure to particulate matter and gain a better understanding of the fate of aerosols in the lung Specific Aims: 1. Use human models to assess deposition patterns of aerosols in fractional gravity 2. Develop rat models to assess deposition patterns that can subsequently be used to directly assess lung damage 3. Develop more comprehensive computational models of aerosol deposition under fractional - gravity. Methods: 1. Patterns of aerosol deposition in lung of humans experiencing fractional gravity will be assessed in subjects exposed to aerosol s during the descent phases of parabolic flights. The effort will involve coupling existing sophisticated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of the upper airways of humans, to the PIs model of the alveolar region of the lung, to predict aerosol deposition under conditions matching those of the experiments performed in humans 2. Deposition of particulates in the rat lungs during exposure to fractional gravity will be assessed in animals in animals exposed to aerosol s during the descent phases of parabolic flights, by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Detailed 3D images of the rat bronchial tree will be used to develop an upper airway CFD model and predict aerosol deposition under conditions matching those of the experiments performed in rats. 3. A model of 4 generations of bifurcating alveolar ducts with moving-walls will be developed to assess particle deposi tion in alveoli in fractional gravity. This task will develop models that will be useful for predicting the transport of aerosol to the periphery of the lung in fractional gravity and therefore will aid assessment of the health risk of exposure or respirable dust in extraterrestrial habitats. Deliverables: Risk Characterization/ quantification_Evidence Research data on a potential factor to consider in establishing Permissible Exposure Limits; research data on the dynamics of aerosols in the lungs.

Task : Clearance of Particles Depositing in the Human Lung in Low Gravity Short Title: Human Lung Low G Responsible Organization: SHFH/AEHP Supporting Organization : N/A Funding Source: NSBRI Other gaps supported by this task: AEH 2, AEH 5 The objective of this study is to access rates of clearance of particulate deposited in alveoli during exposure to reduced gravity. Specific Aim: The specific aim of this task is to test the hypothesis that clearance rates from the lung of particles deposited in low -gravity will be substantially reduced compared to that in 1G, resulting in increased residence times of these particles in the periphery of the lung, enhancing thei r potential to cause lung damage. Methods: The hypothesis will be tested by measuring the clearance rates (measured in 1G) over a few hours to ~1 -2 days, of radio-labeled particles deposited in healthy humans both in 1G and in low -gravity corresponding to the lunar surface (~1/6G) during parabolic flight. This task will provide a comprehensive assessment of alterations in the clearance rate of particles inhaled under reduced gravity. The data will contribute to the development of design requirements for habitats that will ensure that lunar dust is controlled within safe limits. Deliverables: Risk Characterization/quantification_Evidence Research data on a potential factor to consider in establishing Permissible Exposure Limits; research data on the dynamics of aerosols in the lungs.

Risk Context Food mus t be free from microbiological, chemical and foreign matter contamination for up to five years of storage to provide a viable food system for the extended duration space missions. Inefficient sanitation, recordkeeping, processes, facilities and many other factors could cause contamination compromising crew health or survival. Nutrition is essential for the crew by providing nutrients and energy through calories. Adequate nutritional content of the food for up to five years, will ensure crew performance and protects the body from deficiencies that may causes disease. Food acceptability, using sensory analysis, measures texture, appearance, flavor, aroma and temperature of a food item. Acceptable food for up to five years encourages consumption and boosts crew morale by alleviating boredom and stress, and promotes unity amongst the crew during meal time. Inefficient use of resources such as mass, volume, power, crew time and waste disposal capacity affect mission success. All of these elements influence the safety and quality of flight. Operational Relevance The paramount importance of the food system in a long duration manned exploration mission cannot be underestimated. The food system provides not only the nutrients needed for the survival and health of the astronauts, but it also enhances the psychological well being of the crew by being a familiar element in an unfamiliar and hostile environment. Inadequacy of a food system can be influenced by four criteria: safety, nutrition, acceptability and an imbalance of vehicle resources such as mass, volume and crewtime. Since quality loss, which includes the critical components of nutrition and acceptability, will occur over the shelf life of the food, additional research is needed to improve the understanding of the nutritional content of the food when consumed and how much variety, acceptability, and ease of use is required for different duration missions. Research areas may include: shelf life studies including the effects of time, temperature and radiation; im provement in food preservation; improvement in food packaging, and evaluating the effect of the space environment and length of mission on food acceptability, variety, and ease of use. Research is also required for the food systems necessary to HRP -47065 REV B 534 support EVA and contingency suited operations. The research will consider requirements to comply with the mission resources such as mass, volume, power, and crew time. There is considerable overlap between the food system, nutrition requirements, and crew behavior and performance. The nutrition an astronaut receives is a function of both the nutritional content of the food and the amount of food that is actually consumed. Nutritional requirements are determined by looking at the physiological needs of the crew due t o microgravity, space radiation, or stress, as examples. The food system delivers nutrition in the food. Any nutritional losses in the food due to shelf life, exposure to the outside environment, or through processing, need to be taken into account. The acceptability of the food system is closely related to crew performance since higher acceptability or variety of the food will improve the well being of the crewmember. Crewmembers tend to reduce food consumption when confronted with a lack of variety or unacceptable foods. Mitigation Strategy The approach the AFT Project has taken is to determine the technology gaps for a given mission. It may be that for missions of short duration there is no need for mitigation. Another type of mitigation is one base d on less available upmass and volume allowed for food. Once the risk for the specific mission has been identified, then the AFT Project determines whether there are commercially available technologies that can mitigate the risk. If that is the case, then the project further evaluates the technology to determine whether the technology must be modified to approve the technology for flight. If there is not a commercially available technology, then the AFT Project must develop the technology by initially determining the requirements of the new technology. Once the requirements are identified, the AFT Project determines whether to develop the technology internally in the Space Food Systems Laboratory, partner with other HRP Projects, or through a contract with external researchers. An alternative approach, which leverages Human Research Program funding by partnering with the Department of Defense Combat Feeding Directorate (DoD CFD), uses a Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) between the AFT Pr oject and DoD CFD. Gaps AFT1: How can the food system deliver the required level of nutrition throughout the mission ? The nutrition requirements, determined by the EVA Physiology, Systems, and Performance (EPSP) and Non -Exercise Physiological Countermea sures (NxPCM) Projects of the Human Health and Countermeasures Element (HHC), are delivered via the food system and through supplementation. There are requirements for nominal operations and contingency operations, as well as Extravehicular Activities (EVA). Packaged foods, rehydratables, thermostabilized, and irradiated products, are processed, which can reduce the nutritional content. In addition, extended storage of these foods and exposure to a variety of environmental conditions such as heat, oxygen, and space radiation will often affect the stability of the vitamins. HRP -47065 REV B 535 Task: Suited Contingency Ops Food Short Title: Contingency Food Responsible Organization: SHFH/AFT Supporting Organization: Funding Source: Directed Other gaps supported by this tas k: N/A The Suited Contingency Food System should provide the nutrient composition specified in HS6062 per the Constellation Program Human Systems Integration Requirements (HSIR) document No: CxP 70024, section 3.10.3.1.2, In-Suit Nutrition during Unpressurized Vehicle Survival. The nutrition consumption capability would be needed during limited-duration pressurized survival, Intra -Vehicular Activity (IVA) or contingency Extra -Vehicular Activity (EVA), and extended duration pressurized survival for up to 144 hours. When unplanned cabin pressure reduction occurs and during long duration pressurized suited operations, the crew will need to consume nutrition to maintain enough strength to perform vehicle survival tasks. The specific aims of this evaluation are: 1. To coordinate interface options with suit team including the nutrition delivery system 2. To identify nutritional requirements during contingency events 3. To identify potential commercial items 4. To develop new food products if insufficient commercial items meeting the criteria are available. Initially, the project will interface with the Extravehicular Activity Technology Research and Development (EVA R&D) to understand the feeding system design limitations, requirements, relevant parameters and guidelines. In addition, AFT will receive energy requirements from EPSP and nutritional requirements from HHC (Nutritional Biochemistry Laboratory). After the estimation of the nutrition requirements has been set up, the limitations of in -suit feeding have been defined, and mission duration assumptions have been made, an evaluation system will be developed to rate commercial food items on nutrition, compatibility with system, shelf life, and human factors. If no commercial item is appropriate, product development wil l ensue to develop contingency food. At the conclusion, the project will provide a requirements framework for contingency food and identify a suitable food to meet those requirements. The project will ensure that nutrition is delivered in contingency oper ations - a partial fulfillment of the gap. Other mission scenarios would still need to be addressed. Deliverables: Requirements_Flight Rule/MRID/Practice Guidelines; Technology_Prototype Hardware This study enables fulfillment of the HSIR requirement for Contingency operations nutrition including the requirements framework for contingency food, identification of a suitable food to meet those requirements, and the packaging system to deliver the contingency food. Required Delivery Milestone: Requirements for the food delivery system are needed by the EVA Suit Configuration-1Critical Design Review Systems Requirement Review; the food for nutrition delivery and the delivery system is required for the EVA Suit Configuration-1Critical Design Review. Required Platforms: Ground HRP -47065 REV B 536 Task: Effects of Processing and Subsequent Storage on Nutrition Short Title: Nutrition and Processing Responsible Organization: SHFH/AFT Supporting Organization: Funding Source: Directed Other gaps supported by this task: HHC/NxPCM Gap N1 The nutritional content of the flight food items is not measured for NASA's flight food. The actual macronutrients and some minerals are determined analytically. However, the other nutrients, such as vitamins, are determined through a computer program which calculates the combined nutritional content based on the food products formulation. The computer program does not take into account the loss of nutrients during processing or storage. The specific aims of this evaluation are: 1. To determine the effect of processing on representative Space Food Systems Laboratory (SFSL) food products by comparing the calculated nutrition with the actual nutrition one month after processing. 2. To determine the effect of subsequent storage on nutrition by comparing the one month chemical analysis results with results at one year and three years. 3. To determine the capability of the current food system to provide adequate nutrition for long duration missions. Genesis R&D, a software product of ESHA Research, will be util ized to estimate the food product nutritional profiles. As food products are produced for flight provisioning, 3 product samples per food item will be sent to Covance Laboratories for full nutritional profiling and six will be placed into ambient storage (20.5\u00b0C). At the one -year and three-year anniversaries of production, 3 more samples will be submitted for nutritional analysis. The estimated and analytical data will be aggregated within a database for analysis and file sharing. At the conclusion, the project will provide perspective on the nutritional delivery of the current food system and enable decisions on the necessity of nutritional countermeasures for deep space missions. The project will not close the gap but will provide status as to the size of the nutrition gap for deep space missions such that future work can be scoped and prioritized appropriately. Deliverables: Risk Characterization/Quantification_ Evidence This study determines the current risk to nutrition if the current food system is used for a deep space mission by analyzing the actual nutritional content of each of NASA's flight foods. Required Delivery Milestone: FY2015 - Required for integration into the food system solution to ensure requirements for missions beyond low earth or bit are met. However, if information is available prior to FY2015, the data could be used to influence the food system for the ISS. Required Platforms: Ground Task: Understanding Kinetics of Nutrient Degradation in Supporting task: N/A A knowledge of nutrient kinetics enables estimations of the nutrient content of a food over its shelf life without conducting an ac tual shelf life study. Nutrients may include but are not limited to vitamin A, vitamin C, folic acid, and thiamin. Vitamin degradation is known to depend on environmental factors such as pH, oxygen availability, and percent moisture as well as processing history. Therefore, the proposals should focus on illuminating the rate of loss as a function of not only temperature and time but also the stated environmental considerations. The suggested aims of this evaluation are: 1. To determine the rates of vitam in degradation as a function of time and temperature 2. To determine the rates of vitamin degradation as a function of the surrounding food matrix 3. To determine any interacting factors that significantly influence nutrient degradation 4. To develop predictive models for nutrient level as a function of temperature, time, and specified environmental factors 5. To verify models with published empirical data as well as NASA space food data The nutrient kinetics should be studied in a simple food system. The food system variables should be clearly defined and monitored along the course of the study. The nutrient analysis should follow AOAC methodology and follow degradation for at least one year. At the conclusion, the project will provide models to predict the nutrient content of any food given that the model inputs are known. The project will not close the gap but will be used to status the size of the nutrition gap for deep space missions such that future work can be scoped and prioritized appropriately. Deliverables: Technology or Tool_ Computational Models This study creates a model for more accurate prediction of nutrient profile in packaged space food. Required Delivery Milestone: FY2016 - To supplement results of Effects of Processing and Subsequent Storage on Nutrition study such that total food system nutrition is known. Results will be provided to the DoD Collaboration task to improve formulation efforts. Required for integration into the food system solution to ensure requirements for missions beyond low earth orbit are met. However, if information is available prior to FY2015, the data could be used to influence the food system for the ISS. Required Platforms: Ground AFT2: How can the nutrition and acceptability of the food system be maintained throughout the mission ? HRP -47065 REV B 538 Nutrition and acceptability are related. The literature suggests that food quality (color, texture, etc.) may provide a general indication of nutritional loss of the food. The activities in this gap are those that measure both nutrit ion and acceptability. If the food is not acceptable to the crew, the crew will not eat an adequate amount of the food and will be compromised nutritionally. Freeze - dried, thermostabilized, and irradiated foods are processed, which can reduce the quality including acceptability and nutritional content. In addition, extended storage of these foods and exposure to a variety of environmental conditions such as heat, oxygen, and space radiation will often affect the quality of the products. Task: DoD Coll aboration Short Title: /AFT Supporting Organization: Funding Source: Directed Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Both NASA and Department of Defense (DoD) require long shelf life, shelf stable food items with high barrier packaging, and minimal packaging in their food systems. The DoD Combat Feeding Directorate (CFD), when conducting their research, uses collaborations of subject matter experts from industry, government, and academia experts. Currently, the DoD has an on -going packaging research program as well as a program to investigate emerging preservation technologies. These preservation technologies has resulted in Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of pressure assisted thermal sterilization and microwave sterilization for shelf stable products. Both processes have a high potential for long duration space flight missions. The specific aims of this evaluation are: 1. To substantiate the immediate quality and shelf life benefits of products produced with pressure assisted thermal sterilization and microwave sterilization 2. To evaluate new and existing packaging as associated with these processing technologies 3. To recommend advanced food packaging and preservation technologies for shelf stable foods Rese archers at the DoD will test pressure assisted thermal sterilization and microwave sterilization on compatible products as appropriate for military needs. Additionally, DoD researchers will evaluate packaging technologies that may be compatible with the processing technologies. Samples and data will be provided to NASA for further analysis and evaluation. Results will be received from the Integration of Product, Package Process, and Environment task to improve formulation efforts. At the conclusion, the feasibility and advantages of emerging food stabilization technologies for the space food system should be identified. The project has high potential to partially fill the gap of a highly nutritious and acceptable food system. The project will not address those food items incompatible with the two described technologies. Additionally, the products may not be applicable to all missions due to shelf life limitations without additional technology. Deliverables: Technology or Tool_ Systems Solutions/Prototype hardware This study evaluates the applicability of technology for the space program. Additionally, the technology HRP -47065 REV B 539 potentially allows for the production of food as a countermeasure to inadequate nutrition and acceptability. Required Delivery Milestone: FY2017 - Required for integration into the food system solution to ensure requirements for missions beyond low earth orbit are met. If information is available prior to this, it could be applied to the ISS food system if it would positively impact its long-term nutrient stability or reduce food logistics. Required Platforms: Ground Task: Integration of Product, Package Process, and Environment Short Title: Integrated Food System Responsible Organization: AFT Supporting Organization: SHFH Funding So urce: Directed Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Prepackaged foods have not been shown to have the shelf life necessary to support extended -duration, deep space missions. To support these missions, food system improvements involving integration of recipe formulation, processing, packaging, and the environment are necessary. The specific aims of this evaluation are: 1. To summarize the state of the art packaged food technologies 2. To perform a risk -benefit analysis on using the space environment for food storage 3. To recommend food formulation changes, processes, packages, and environments to obtain a five - year shelf life 4. To identify outstanding technology needs to supplement proposed recommendation Data mining and a trade study, as appropriate, will be completed to ascertain the state of packaged food technologies. Similarly, data mining and simulated storage studies will be used to evaluate potential advantages and drawbacks to using the space environment for product storage. The current food items will be analyzed by food type to determine how best to extend the shelf life while protecting food quality. The culmination of the work will be a matrix identifying the process, package, and environmental pairing to achieve a five -year shelf life for the various food types. At the conclusion, a recommendation to move the food system to a five -year shelf life will be presented to mission leadership. Included in those recommendations could be a set of processing, packaging, formulation, and environment requirements for each food type. The project will not close the gap but will identify a pathway to closing the gap such that future technology solutions work can be scoped and prioritized appropriately. Deliverables: Requirements_ Flight Rule/MRID/Practice Guid elines Required Delivery Milestone: FY2015 - Required for integration into the food system solution to ensure requirements for missions beyond low earth orbit are met. If information is available prior to this, it could be applied to the ISS food system if it would positively impact its long -term nutrient stability or HRP -47065 REV B 540 reduce food logistics. Required Platforms: Ground AFT3: How can the acceptability of the food system be maintained throughout the mission ? If the food is not acceptable to the crew, the crew will not eat an adequate amount of the food and will be compromised nutritionally. Anecdotal reports have suggested that the food does not taste the same in microgravity. Other reports indicate that the crew craves different foods on-orbit as compared to on-Earth. In addition, the crew has reported that they tire of certain foods over the 6-month ISS mission. Task: Effects of Retronasal Smelling, Variety, and Choice on Appetite and Satiety Short Title: Appetite in Space Responsible Organization: SHFH/AFT Supporting Organization: Funding Source: NRA Other gaps supported by this task: N/A The proposed work should mitigate the risk of an inadequate food system by providing evidence to base requirements for an acceptable food system. The specific aims of the study are: 1. To establish the relationship between nasal patency and smelling in microgravity and isolation/confinement (deep space habitat) 2. To determine the effect of orthonasal and retronasal smelling on appetite if under menu fatigue 3. To det ermine if crew-prepared foods mitigates menu fatigue and improves crew satisfaction 4. To provide ESM cost comparison of crew -prepared and prepackaged food systems Participants will be provided odorant samples to evaluate as part of a bed rest study at Univer sity of Texas, Medical Branch (UTMB) to simulate smelling in microgravity. Measurements of the cavity dimensions and nasal airway resistance will be combined with retronasal smelling for analysis. A second bed rest study will evaluate how a subject's observation and olfactory perception of a meal impacts appetite and desire to eat. This test will be repeated over time to stimulate menu fatigue. Finally, 5 volunteers will inhabit the Mars Desert Research Station analog site for 4 months, depending upon prepackaged food provisions and crew -prepared meals. The crew food intake and satisfaction will be tracked along with ESM factors, like crew time and water usage. At the conclusion, there will be quantitative data on how smell changes in space, the impact of smell on menu fatigue, and the impact of crew -prepared food on menu fatigue. The project has high potential to supply knowledge such that future menu improvements will partially fill the gap of an acceptable food system. Deliverables: Risk Characterization/Quantification_ Evidence HRP -47065 REV B 541 The deliverable will be passed on to the Understanding the Effects of Microgravity on Taste and Influencing Mood Through Dining Experience tasks. Required Delivery Milestone: FY2014 - Required for integration into the food system solution to ensure requirements for missions beyond low earth orbit are met. If this information is available prior to this, it could be applied to the ISS food system if it would positively impact its long -term nutrient stability or reduce food lo gistics. Required Platforms: Flight Task: Understanding the Effects of Microgravity on Taste Short Title: Taste in Microgravity Responsible Organization: SHFH/AFT Supporting Organization: Funding Source: Directed Other gaps supported by this task: N/A The proposed work should mitigate the risk of an inadequate food system by providing evidence to base requirements for an acceptable food system. The specific aims of the study are: 1. To determine if certain taste perceptions (salty, sweet, sour, bitter, umami) differ significantly when perceived in microgravity as compared to perception on Earth 2. To determine if spice heat intensity differs significantly when perceived in microgravity as compared to perception on Earth 3. To recommend recipe modifications and/or condiment additions to improve the acceptability of the food system in microgravity Crew members will be asked a series of general food preference questions to establish any flavor biases prior to testing. Then, crew members will be provided food- grade solutions preflight and during the mission to evaluate for acceptability and intensity (at least two hours after eating or drinking). The preflight and mission ratings will be analyzed to determine if a difference exists. Recommendations to impact the menu will be integrated with other results to optimize menu options for deep space and microgravity missions. At the conclusion, there will be quantitative confirmation or rebuttal of the commonly held notion that foods taste different in space with d irection on how to improve acceptability of menu items in space. The project has high potential to supply knowledge such that future menu improvements will partially fill the gap of an acceptable food system. Deliverables: Risk Characterization/Quantifi cation_ Evidence Required Delivery Milestone: FY2017 - Food system requirements definition needed for long duration missions. However, if information is available prior to this, it could be used to influence the food system for ISS. Required Platforms: Flight HRP -47065 REV B 542 # of Upmass (kg/subject) Downmass (hrs) >10 0 0.5 0.4 1.0 1.5 Task: Influencing Mood Through Dining Experience Short Title: Improving Mood Responsible Organ ization: SHFH/AFT Supporting Organization: SHFH by this task: BHP Gap3 The eating experience will increase in importance on longer missions as operations seeks pathways to ensure adequate nutritional intake and m inimal stress. AFT, in coordination with the BHP team, would seek to identify methods to enhance the eating experience on orbit. The proposed work will investigate how special meals and eating occasions as well as \"cooking\" on orbit can impact mood, stress, and behavior. The suggested aims of this evaluation are: 1. To identify \"trigger\" foods and occasions to define when mood evaluations will be taken 2. To determine the relative impact on mood when trigger foods are provided in varying initial mood states 3. To determine the effect of communal dining as compared to solo dining on mood state 4. To determine the role of food preparation on mood and stress 5. To recommend dining behaviors and practices that positively affect the mood, stress, and behavior of crew on extended missions Researchers will supply a mixture of \"trigger\" foods from holiday eating occasions, common comfort foods, and treats to International Space Station for the test subjects. A mood evaluation will be compiled and validated by the Behavior He alth and Performance Element. (BHP). At designated times, crew will self -evaluate their mood via questionnaire, eat a prescribed dish, and then re -evaluate mood. The crew will also be asked to evaluate before and after some communal and solo dining occasions as well. Finally, test subjects will be asked to \"cook\" a simple meal and complete the evaluation before and after preparation. The study will provide a quantitative assessment of the impact of food and dining on crew mood, stress, and behavior. The project will partially fill the gap of an acceptable food system in that it can provide guidelines on how to match the psychosocial benefits of food on Earth for the crew in space. Deliverables: Countermeasures_ Protocol The deliverable will be passed on to the Behavior Health and Performance Element. Required Delivery Milestone: FY2017 - Food system requirements definition needed for long-duration missions. However, if information is available prior to this, it could be used to influence the food system for ISS. HRP -47065 REV B 543 Required Platforms: Flight # of Initial Upmass technologies can be developed that will efficientl y balance appropriate vehicle resources such as mass, volume, and crew time during exploration missions with the safety, nutrition, and acceptability requirements ? The balancing of resources with nutrition and acceptability is dependent on the specific mi ssion. For example, shorter missions utilizing smaller vehicles will consider mission resource utilization of primary importance due to the small usable volume in the vehicle. Since the missions are shorter, nutrition and acceptability may not be as critical. Ineffective use of vehicle resources such as mass, waste, and crew time can jeopardize mission success. Mass of the packaged food system is based on mass of the food and the packaging surrounding the food. Food packaging produces a significant amount of waste. A bioregenerative food system, while providing the crew with fresh foods and using less packaged food, will require more crew time, power needs and water. Trade studies will be required to determine the best use of resource utilization while bal ancing the other food system requirements. Current preflight procedures and existing research plans incorporate good manufacturing processes (GMP) to insure food safety. However, with new processes future NASA missions, GMP will need to be developed to reduce the risk of food borne illness. Task: Comparative Packaging Study Short Title: Comparative Packaging Responsible Organization: SHFH/AFT Supporting Organization: SHFH Funding Source: Directed Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Currently the packaging used for freeze- dried foods and natural form foods does not have adequate oxygen and moisture barrier properties to allow for an 18-month shelf life for ISS. Therefore, those foods are over wrapped with a second foil -containing package which has h igher barrier properties. The proposed works seeks to identify the requirements of a single packaging material to replace the two -step packaging system . The specific aims of this evaluation are: 1. To determine the oxygen and moisture ingress into food item s packed in selected packaging materials 2. To determine sensory changes in foods packed in the selected packaging materials 3. To evaluate the potential of each packaging material based on qualitative and quantitative results. HRP -47065 REV B 544 Peanuts, toasted oat cereal, and cottonseed oil samples are packaged in three materials - Combitherm, Technipaq, and a Tolas material - and then stored at ambient temperature (72\u00b0F) and varying humidities (25%, 50%, and 75% RH). Control samples are frozen to maintain freshness for Degree-of - Difference sensory testing. The samples are evaluated every three months for moisture, headspace, hexanal, and organoleptic changes. At the conclusion, the adequacy of current packaging materials to perform independently as packaging for freeze -dried and natural form foods will be known. The project has potential to partially fill the gap of ineffective resource utilization by decreasing the upmass of the packaging system and reducing trash volumes. Deliverables: Technology or Tool_ System Solutions/Prototype Hardware Required Delivery Milestone: FY2017 - Required as a design solution to support the food system for operations for missions beyond low earth orbit. However, if information is available prior to this, it could be used to influence the food system for ISS. Required Platforms: Ground Task: Bulk Overwrap Packaging Short Title: Bulk Packaging Responsible Organization: SHFH/AFT Supporting Organization: Funding Source: Directed Other gaps supported by this task: N/A The current packaging system for freeze -dried and natural form foods uses a primary package for visual inspection and secondary overwrap for moisture and oxygen protection. Using a bulk overwrap system instead of individual package overwrap will save on mass and volume for longer duration missions. The overwrap can also be used as a flexible container to save on mass and volume in the shorter duration Orion missions. The specific aims of this evaluation are: 1. To design an outer overwrap bag that minimizes mass and vol ume but can be utilized for stowage of space food 2. To identify packaging materials (film, scavengers, etc.) that improve feasibility of bulk overwrap 3. To develop and process for stowing, vacuum flushing, and sealing the overwrap bag 4. To compare mass and volume of the bulk overwrap system to individual overwrap and to the current ISS rigid container Wooden boxes are constructed in varying dimensions to serve as molds for the bulk overwrap bag. Food is stowed into the bag while the bag is positioned in the mold. Configurations are changed to optimize both dimensions and stowage volume. Once stowed, scavengers are added to the bag, if indicated through testing, the bag is evacuated/flushed, and sealed. Food breakage as well headspace gas concentrations is det ermined for each bulk pack. Mass and volume for each pack is measured. The process is repeated for multiple categories of food containers. Packaging materials are evaluated to identify a suitable material for sealing, strength, and usability. HRP -47065 REV B 545 At the con clusion, the project will demonstrate whether a bulk overwrap alternative to individual overwraps and/or the rigid container is feasible. The project has potential to partially fill the gap of ineffective resource utilization by decreasing the upmass of the packaging system and reducing trash volumes. Deliverables: Technology or Tool_ System Solutions/Prototype Hardware Required Delivery Milestone: FY2015 - Required as a design solution to support the food system for operations for missions beyond low earth orbit.

Required Platforms: Ground Task: Flexible High-Barrier Polymers for ization: SHFH/AFT Supporting Other gaps supported by this task: N/A The development of a polymer laminate with water and oxygen barrier properties suitable for food packaging and preservation on 3-5 year manned space exploration missions is proposed. The laminate is a multilayer structure comprising polymer and inorganic dielectrics that will provide near -hermetic encapsulation of food items for the duration of these missions. In Phase I, flexible polymer barriers with an oxygen transport rate of <0.005 cc/m2 -day and water transport rate of <0.005 g/m2-day were developed. The barriers contain no metal foils, have an areal density of <34 g/m2 for a 40 micron thick film, and tolerate high temperature sterilization treatments. The polymer laminates are mechanically robust exhibiting a 165MPa yield strength, 550MPa tensile modulus, and 3% elongation to yield. In Phase II, we propose to optimize barrier properties to reduce weight, minimize ash on incineration, develop heat -sealing methods, and expand the testing to include heat sealed enclosures. The Phase II effort also includes a collaboration with a potential high -volume manufacturer of the barrier films for aerospace applications. The specific aims of this evaluation are: The overall objective of the Phase II effort is the development of a flexible barrier material with the following properties: \u00b7 Thickness range of 25- 40 mm. \u00b7 Areal density of < 45gm/m2. \u00b7 Preservation of barrier properties after retor t sterilization. \u00b7 Suitable for microwave sterilization. \u00b7 Barriers will be heat sealed with preservation of barrier properties after sealing and retort sterilization. \u00b7 Ash content after incineration < 4 g/m2 of barrier. \u00b7 Barriers will contain no halocarbons (Cl , F, Br). \u00b7 Barriers will be classed FDA Food Grade for solids and semi-solid food contact for 3-5 year exposure. HRP -47065 REV B 546 \u00b7 Barriers will have sufficient optical transmission to inspect food contents after sealing and sterilization. \u00b7 Barriers will have sufficient stren gth and puncture resistance to tolerate handling and to prevent damage from food items during vacuum sealing. To meet these performance goals, the following technical objectives have been identified for the Phase II effort. 1. To develop a high-barrier co ating containing no halocarbons, by a. Substitution of -N for Parylene -C. b. Substitution of Parylene -C with laminated face sheets of BOPP and related polyolefins. 2. To identify the minimum thickness and areal density that achieves the desired barrier and mechanical properties, without compromising ease of handling 3. To develop an edge sealing technology based on heat curing of crosslinkable coatings that has comparable barrier properties to the polymer film. 4. To conduct a detailed study of the barrier properties of edge -sealed enclosures subjected to, a. Retort sterilization b. Exposure to hydrophilic agents, pH 4 -10. c. Exposure to oils d. Accelerated testing of filled enclosures at 90oC and 110oC. 5. To investigate the use of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) as a lower cost, high transmittance alternative to polyimide 6. To conduct a GLP assessment of food contact safety with the objective of attaining FDA Food Grade certification . At the conclusion, the project will demonstrate whether a high barrier polymer packaging material is feasible. The project has potential to partially fill the gap of ineffective resource utilization by decreasing the upmass of the packaging system and reducing trash volumes.

Given those parameters, a beverage and bar will be formulated in the lab, sensory tested, and provided an estimated shelf life on chemical and ingredient properties. At the conclusion of the project, prototype beverages and bars will be available for inclusion into the space food system. The project has potential to partially fill the gap of ineffective resource utilization by decreasing the upmass of the food system and reducing packaging trash volumes .

In a bioregenerative food system, vegetables and fruit would be grown during surface missions and baseline crops such as soybeans, wheat, rice, peanuts, and dried beans would be grown or launched in bulk from Earth. The baseline crops would be processed into edible ingredients. The edible ingredients and freshly grown fruits and vegetables would be used in preparing meals in the galley. Some prepackaged food would likely be required. Further studies are required to determine the magnitude of mass savings and the effect on other mission resources such as power, crew time, and recycling of water used for food processing.

Lunar Validation Studies Prep System (SBIR)AFT HRP -47065 REV B 559 RISK OF ERROR DUE TO INADEQUATE INFORMATI ONCRITICALITY: LUNAR OUTPOST C, MARS A Risk Statement TBD Risk Context Information presentation, acquisition and processing significantly affect human task performance. Effective information availability directly impacts all aspects of communication, which is a vital element to all space missions. Task errors during human spaceflight missions could have significant consequences to performance of mission objectives as well as human safety. Therefore further research regarding proper information presentation will allow for opportunities to optimize presentation of information, its timeliness, the user's level of awareness of the information, modes of information presentation, proper information comprehension, training methods, and development of procedures Operational Relevance One of the most critical enablers of human presence in space has been ensuring that there are human systems standards in place that will provide for crew health as well as standards for habitability, environmental, and human factors. The Space Flight Human System Standards - SFHSS - (and the companion Human Integration Design Handbook - HIDH) require that each human spaceflight program derive program -specific, verifiable requirements to comply with the standards, and require that each human spaceflight program establish a human factors process involving health and human factors experts. This is to ensure that there will be identification of any standards in the SFHSS that are not applicable (or altered) and the rationale for non-applicability; that all program level health and human factors requirements are based on the HIDH, cited empirical evidence, or known best practices; and that end - items are in compliance with SFHSS, and agency and program level requirements and specifications. The activities cited reflect the need to work toward the mitigation of identified SHFE risks by continuing to inform the standards, by engagement in the development of the requirements that will implement the standards based upon the resulting products, as well as providing content to the HIDH that will serve as the implementation guide. In addition, products resulting from these activities may provide valuable information to spaceflight programs that can inform the requests for trade studies. To ensure ope rational relevance of the deliverables from the tasks, all tasks leaders will identify stakeholders who will work with them in framing the questions and approach. The stakeholders will participate by identifying specific issues requiring research or techno logy development, by reviewing progress, and by suggesting operational evaluations. Depending on the specific tasks, stakeholders may include engineers or operations personnel. Strategy for Mitigation The approach to mitigating this risk is to develop an understanding of the factors that contribute to this risk, identify gaps in our knowledge about these factors, and prioritize these gaps based on various criteria systematically applied. Then the highest priority gaps are addressed through directed or sol icited research depending on the time frame and the complexity and specificity of the gap. Where there is a disconnect between critical gaps requiring addressing and a lack of funding, efforts are made to re-examine the programmatic priorities to ensure those of highest concern are being investigated. The risk associated with error due to inadequate information focuses on identifying the causes of risk, for example, the lack of situational awareness that might be due to poorly designed interfaces or tasks, and HRP -47065 REV B 560 the subsequent development of information presentation standards for reducing operator errors in spaceflight through adequate understanding of the causes and mitigations of the errors. As the topic of inadequate information is comprehensive, the app roach to mitigating this risk is to focus on the display of information, the types of controls that interface between the human and the displays, and the procedures to accomplish tasks. It is not possible to separate the strategy for mitigating this risk f rom the strategy for dealing with the risk of Errors due to Poor Task Design. The information that is needed to perform a task at a given time depends substantially on the nature of the task and the crewmembers' roles and responsibilities. The work descr ibed under this risk presumes the task is well designed and focuses on the problems of ensuring the necessary information is presented in such a way as to enable timely, accurate performance. The specific selection choices of the highest priority gaps and tasks are based primarily on gap analyses. The SHFE project updates its gap analyses on an annual basis. This is necessary as research results and continual information drawn from crew debriefings has the potential of discovering additional gaps in knowl edge. These updates assist in the preparation for the annual Science Review Panel. The original analysis carried out in 2006 was published as NASA/TP-2007- 213739 (\"Space Human Factors Engineering Gap Analysis Project Final Report,\" C. Hudy and B. Woolford, 2007). An update was completed in spring 2007. The gaps are identified through reviews of the literature, of crew debrief summaries, and through interviews with more than a hundred users of human factors results, representing Engineering, Mission Ope rations, Flight Medicine, Training, the Crew Office, and others. We place particular emphasis on interviewing representatives from Constellation Program Office, the Human - System Integration Group, the Orion Project Office, the Cockpit Display Working Group, and other programmatic users of our products. The 'small' gaps or specific concerns identified from these sources are aggregated into more appropriate levels for which a specific task can be designed. For example, numerous users report gaps in design for workload: lack of consistency of definition; lack of easy to use methods to assess workload; lack of a way to verify that a requirement for workload has been met. These various individual -level concerns are captured in a gap, \"There is no standardized non-intrusive measure of workload.\" SHFE will scope the Agency's Space Technology Demonstration projects for research and technology gaps in FY11, in anticipation of initiating a Directed Research Project (DRP) in FY12 that will infuse SHFE subject matter expertise as appropriate. It has been our experience that the initiation of new Exploration activities invariably raises unforeseen SHFE issues and gaps (for example, the Thrust Oscillation associated with the Ares I launch profile raised the issue o f display readability under vibration). Generally, these point-design challenges are best addressed by internal, directed efforts. More fundamental SHFE issues will be addressed via competed research (e.g., an RFP call slated for FY 14). As part of the integrated Performance Change - Behavioral Health, SHFE anticipates funding two tasks related to the acquisition and analysis of task performance data onboard the ISS. The goal of these tasks is to provide robust, in situ space operations data for SHFE res earchers. One of the tasks will be a directed, in-house effort; its focus will be on the integration of data acquisition tools and the secure capture, storage, and redaction of performance data; this task has an anticipated start date of FY14. The second task will be a competed effort to develop robust analysis tools to develop and verify predictive models of performance; this task is also slated for an FY14 start. After all concerns are mapped to gaps, the gaps are prioritized according to a number of criteria. Key criteria are importance to Constellation Program and need date. When we identify 'TBRs' or 'TBDs' in the Human Systems Integration Requirements, for example, these are assigned a very high priority. Ratings are solicited from management representatives of the offices from which gaps were identified. After prioritization, the gaps that can be addressed within the budget are initiated through directed research or solicited through research announcements. Directed research is chosen for time critical results. Solicitations are used for gaps that are longer term and that can benefit from wider participation. HRP -47065 REV B 561 Gaps Gap #: HCI -1: What are the effects of vibration and acceleration on crew task performance and how can those effects be mitigated? Gap description: TBD Task: Robust Human-System Interfaces for Interface Design Responsible Organization: SHFH Supporting Organization: SHFE Funding Source : NSBRI Other gaps supported by this task: N/A In space, astronauts are in the relatively calm of microgravity. However, the trip to and from space is not a smooth, easy ride for crew members due to extreme vibrations and gravity levels that could reach as much four times normal gravity. These conditions can limit the ability of the crew members to do their jobs successfully. This research project will: 1. Measure, analyze and model human performance in display navigation and flight control tasks during periods of high vibration and altered gravity similar to w hat is expected to occur in NASAs new Crew Exploration Vehicle. 2. Collect performance measurements during simulated ascents and descents. 3. Identify and model human capabilities and limitations during these conditions in order to provide design guidelines for the development of displays and controls. The project's ultimate goal is to reduce mission risks and enhance safety by providing design guidelines for the development of displays and controls.

Gap description : TBD Task: Information Presentation - Displays Development (Visual and Auditory) Short Title : Info Pres Responsible Organization: SHFH Supporting Organization: SHFE Funding Source : Directed HRP -47065 REV B 562 Other gaps supported by this task: This task also addresses the Risk of Reduced Safety and Efficiency Due to an Inadequately Designed Vehicle, Environment, Tools, or Equipment and the Risk of Error D ue to Poor Task Design Optimal displays are critical to crew performance and vehicle operations. Displays must meet the crew's needs and be easy to use, particularly as Exploration mission operations venture farther from the Earth and real-time ground -based operational assistance becomes degraded or unavailable. The focus for visual displays is readability and usability of text, and effective display navigation. The focus of auditory displays is caution and warning system alarms. This is a requirements d evelopment activity, supplemented by some research or validation activities on the ground and in flight. This will result in the development of guidelines, requirements, and validation techniques for advanced information display solutions currently contemplated for the various Constellation Program spacecraft systems consistent with the smaller cockpit environments of the Orion CEV, the Lander, and surface rovers. These requirements and appropriate information will be provided to Orion, Constellation docume ntation (CxP70024 Human System Integration Requirements; Orion Display Standards) and the Space Flight Human System Standards Human Integration Design Handbook. The goal of the Information Presentation Directed Research Project (DRP) is to address design questions related to the presentation of information to the crew. This includes not only the issues of information formatting, style, and layout, but also methods of interacting with the information, use of information under the extreme environments encount ered in space travel, and refinement of human factors techniques, such as modeling, that will supplement traditional design techniques and help ensure that optimal information design is accomplished in the most cost -efficient manner. Defining, refining, an d validating the requirements for the proper display and use of information related to systems monitoring and vehicle control is critical for optimizing operational performance and minimizing operational risk. The products proposed in this DRP will result in the development of guidelines, requirements, and validation techniques for advanced user interfaces currently contemplated for the various spacecraft systems being designed and developed under the Constellation program. The major areas of work, or subtasks, within this DRP are: 1) Displays, 2) Controls, 3) Procedures and Fault Management, and 4) Human Performance Modeling. The Displays subtask addresses human - computer interaction with multi- monitor displays, text color, readability under vibration, visu al health and status indicators, auditory alarms, effects of vibration on speech intelligibility, and auditory displays. Optimal displays are critical to crew performance and vehicle operations. Displays must meet the crew's needs and be easy to use, since Exploration missions may face the greatest autonomy challenge to date. Two types of displays will be addressed within the Displays subtask: Visual displays and Auditory displays. Within Visual displays, the foci will be human -computer interaction with mu lti- monitor consoles, color coding, readability under vibration, and health and status displays. The Auditory displays task will focus on speech alarms and effects of alarm source, the effect of vibration on speech intelligibility, and spatial auditory dis plays. FY10 studies will address the following research areas within the Displays subtask: AIM A - HUMAN -COMPUTER INTERACTION WITH MULTI -MONITOR CONSOLES (JSC) Determine the optimal balance between number of display units and number of display formats for display format navigation.

Develop a testbed for testing of auditory display prototypes. 2. Perform laboratory testing, and iterate the design. 3. Document results in a report. The focus within each major subtask has been carefully selected to address either 1) a near -term identified need within ongoing Orion development work, or 2) a longer -term Exploration need that is sufficiently complex to warrant initiation of research. The research will assist in defining requirements f or display formats and defining standards that designers of information presentation hardware and software can employ to provide the situational awareness necessary to accomplish spaceflight or surface mission objectives. Deliverables: Requirements_ Vehicle/Suit Design Display design requirements Display design recommendations Assessment, selection, and test of display design enhancements that will maximize capability of Habitat Display requirements that may help determine Orion, and lunar rover and habitat display format configurations Display standards for color coding on Orion, and lunar rover and habitat display formats Supplemental data to other vibration data collected and will help confirm a font size recommendation for readability under vibration Supplemental data to other vibration data collected and will help develop standards for readability under vibration Decision aids about the best type of evaluation methods for assessing the impacts of vibration Candidate visual techniques for Orion, and ser ve as a foundation of future research in the area of health and status displays. New requirements for speech alarms New requirements for mitigating speech under vibration Information about the feasibility of a potential technology to be used for planetary exploration Required Delivery Milestone: FY09: Display requirements and to Orion to HSIR, HIDH, Orion CDR FY10:Information Ground: Mockups Task: Information Presentation - Controls Technology Survey and Testing Short Title : Info Pres Responsible Organization: SHFH Supporting Orga nization: SHFE Funding Source : Directed Other gaps supported by this task: This task also addresses the Risk of Reduced Safety and Efficiency Due to an Inadequately Designed Vehicle, Environment, Tools, or Equipment and the Risk of Error Due to Poor Task Design The development of proper controls is critical to preventing errors during human spaceflight. This becomes especially important when the majority of the controls will be software based. Crewmembers must be very aware of what they are manipulatin g on the screen, and must be able to do so under vibration and high-g, as well as in microgravity. They must be able to operate controls ungloved and with pressurized gloved hands. During launch and entry, crews will have no choice other than to use a remote cursor control device. If devices are inadequate for any of the above operational scenarios, crew safety will be compromised and risk loss of productivity. The goal of the Information Presentation Directed Research Project (DRP) is to address desig n questions related to the presentation of information to the crew. This includes not only the issues of HRP -47065 REV B 566 information formatting, style, and layout, but also methods of interacting with the information, use of information under the extreme environments encountered in space travel, and refinement of human factors techniques, such as modeling, that will supplement traditional design techniques and help ensure that optimal information design is accomplished in the most cost -efficient manner. Defining, refining, and validating the requirements for the proper display and use of information related to systems monitoring and vehicle control is critical for optimizing operational performance and minimizing operational risk. The products proposed in this DRP will result in the development of guidelines, requirements, and validation techniques for advanced user interfaces currently contemplated for the various spacecraft systems being designed and developed under the Constellation program. The major areas of work, or subtasks, within this DRP are: 1) Displays, 2) Controls, 3) Procedures and Fault Management, and 4) Human Performance Modeling. The Controls subtask concentrates on cursor control functionality, design, and use under vibration, further enhancement of the Cursor Control Device Test Battery (developed in prior FY effort), and pressurized gloved dexterity. The Controls subtask has primarily focused on cursor control device performance across all funding years, as this has continued to be a primary area of concern for the Orion cockpit, and is now becoming a topic of interest for lunar vehicles. The challenge is designing a device that will provide cursor control during high vibration and g-levels, but also be usable in microgravity. FY10 work will explore the effects of vibration on cursor control performance, using the ARC Vibration Facility and some lunar field testing opportunities. The Cursor Control Device Test Battery will also be enhanced and finalized. FY10 studies will address the following research ar eas within the Controls subtask: Aim A - Cursor Control Device Performance Under Vibration (ARC/JSC) Determine characteristics of cursor control devices that perform well or are problematic under different levels of vibration. Use test battery (Aim B) as one of the test tasks. Test devices in a lunar field test (e.g., Desert RATS). Objective : \u00b7 Evaluate cursor control device performance issues in the ARC ISIS lab under vibration conditions representative of Orion vibration profiles. Examine several alternatives based on the results of the previous lab studies. Determine if any of the top candidates have design features which pose usability problems under vibration. The basic approach for these studies will be as follows: 1. Modify/reuse the software from FY08 and FY09 as much as practical. 2. Recruit a minimum of 10 non-crew as participants. Crew will be invited to participate. 3. Ask participants to perform a representative, vehicle/habitat display task using different cursor control functions under different vibra tion levels. Collect additional data with standard Cursor Control Device Test Battery tasks. 4. Collect data during vibration including response times, errors, and subjective comments and ratings. Aim B - Cursor Control Device Test Battery Enhancement (JSC) Enhance test battery developed in prior funded years to include discrete cursor tasks. Perform usability testing and complete a NASA technology transfer package for public release of the software. Objective : \u00b7 Enhance the cursor control device test battery code and conduct a field test for evaluation. The current version of the test battery has tasks that are appropriate for the evaluation of continuous cursor control devices. In FY10 we will add tasks that will be appropriate for discrete cursor control device evaluation. The approach for this effort will be as follows: 1. Enhance the test battery with several discrete cursor tasks. 2. Perform field testing with researchers to finalize the tool. 3. Refine user guide. 4. Develop new version of the cursor control device t est battery code and user interface. AIM C - Pressurized Gloved Dexterity (JSC) Complete a joint study with EVA to investigate pressurized, gloved dexterity required for HRP -47065 REV B 567 operating controls, including new candidate requirements/standards. Objective : \u00b7 Comp lete a joint study with EVA to investigate pressurized, gloved dexterity required for operating controls. The approach for this effort will be as follows: 1. Use approach similar to that used for suited study in FY09. 2. Conduct test in JSC High Pressure Glovebox. 3. Define 4 levels of glove pressure for testing, ranging from nominal (4.3psi) to contingency (8.1psi). 4. Ask participants to perform a cursor control device task with several devices, interact with a busy board containing knobs and controls, and potentially complete another 1 or 2 tasks in collaboration with the Food Lab (looking at packaging). Materials in the glovebox will be representative of candidate materials to be used in CxP. 5. Document results in a report. The focus within each major subtask has been carefully selected to address either 1) a near -term identified need within ongoing Orion development work, or 2) a longer -term Exploration need that is sufficiently complex to warrant initiation of research. The research will assist i n the definition of appropriate control design requirements that the designer will need to use for hardware to support the user under various environmental conditions e.g., vibration and pressurization. Deliverables: Requirements_Vehicle/Suit Design Contr ol design recommendations Assessment, selection, and test of control design enhancements that will maximize capability of Habitat Candidate requirements for selection of a cursor control device for use in vibration Second revision and completed test batter y Public release of test battery New requirements for gloved operations under high pressure Required Delivery Milestone: FY09 Control requirements and design recommendations for HSIR, HIDH, Orion CDR Ground: Mockups Task: Information Presentation - Electronic Procedures and Fa ult Management Short Title : Info Pres Responsible Organization: SHFH Supporting Organization: SHFE Funding Source : HRP/Directed Other gaps supported by this task: This task also addresses the Risk of Reduced Safety and Efficiency Due to an Inadequately Designed Vehicle, Environment, Tools, or Equipment and the Risk of Error Due to Poor Task Design Future vehicles will eventually operate beyond low-earth orbit, where a more autonomous concept for vehicle operations will be needed, compared to the shuttle. More autonomy means that more onboard operational capability will be required. In addition, next -generation spacecraft will have much smaller interior volumes than the shuttle, and a higher g and vibration profile during dynamic phases of flight. During dynamic flight phases, crewmembers' arms will be strapped to the armrests, necessitating a \"seated\" operations mode in which all crew-vehicle interactions are accomplished through one or more handheld devices. Last but not least, there will be considerably less electronic real estate available than in the shuttle cockpit, bringing pressure to consolidate information onto as few display formats as HRP -47065 REV B 568 possible. Combined, these factors, along with hard pressures on the allowable mass of the vehicles, are forcing fundamental changes to crew-vehicle interfaces. In turn, these changes are dictating new and different concepts of vehicle operations. Design pressures associated with the factors mentioned above are going to impact virtually all vehicle operations. Howev er, their influence is going to be particularly strong on off -nominal operations, such as real -time fault management, that include consulting C&W interfaces to diagnose the \"parent\" cause of a C&W event, and then performing and completing checklists of nominal and off -nominal procedures. For example, nominal and off -nominal procedure checklists will be stored electronically, rather than on paper the way they are today, and all checklists will be accessed and viewed on a customized electronic display format called an electronic procedures viewer (EPV). In this section, we describe Information Presentation work in support of developing, testing, and validating operational concepts (and associated user interfaces) for managing off -nominal situations in next-generation vehicle cockpits. The work encompasses human -in-the-loop simulations of nominal and off -nominal operations in order to evaluate user interfaces, not only with electronic procedures themselves, but with Advanced Caution and Warning systems that assist the crew with all aspects of fault detection, isolation, and recovery. The goal of the Information Presentation Directed Research Project (DRP) is to address design questions related to the presentation of information to the crew. This includes not onl y the issues of information formatting, style, and layout, but also methods of interacting with the information, use of information under the extreme environments encountered in space travel, and refinement of human factors techniques, such as modeling, that will supplement traditional design techniques and help ensure that optimal information design is accomplished in the most cost -efficient manner. Defining, refining, and validating the requirements for the proper display and use of information related to systems monitoring and vehicle control is critical for optimizing operational performance and minimizing operational risk. The products proposed in this DRP will result in the development of guidelines, requirements, and validation techniques for advanced user interfaces currently contemplated for the various spacecraft systems being designed and developed under the Constellation program. The major areas of work, or subtasks, within this DRP are: 1) Displays, 2) Controls, 3) Procedures and Fault Management, and 4) Human Performance Modeling. The Procedures and Fault Management subtask focuses on electronic procedures design and the development of collaborative human/machine operations concepts for off -nominal situation management on next -generation crewed vehicles. Aim A - Electronic procedures formatting Use past study data on electronic procedures use to characterize users' \"look forward\" and \"look back\" behaviors when working with a list of procedures. This will aid in the development of standards for electronic procedures lists and the location of the active line. Objective : \u00b7 Perform a post -hoc analysis of eye tracking data collected in an FY07 evaluation to quantify \"look ahead\" and \"look back\" behaviors. The approach for this study will be as follows: 1. Extract the eye tracker data from the previous experiment data. 2. Perform an analysis quantifying \"look ahead\" and \"look back\" behaviors. Identify any correlation between information acquisition patterns on the electronic procedure viewer and performanc e accuracy. 3. Form preliminary recommendations from this data to be tested in a future evaluation. Aim B - Develop enhanced understanding of viewer information acquisition strategies during off - nominal vehicle operations . Within the context of a fault mana gement scenario with an advanced caution and warning system, we will compare information acquisition strategies (sequences of fixations) and fault management performance across two display conditions. In one condition, the electronic procedure viewer and t he system summary display format which acts as the crew-vehicle interface for performing mode reconfigurations and checking systems parameters (i.e., the interface that supports procedure execution), will occupy separate regions of the multi -function displ ay unit, and will thus be avail able for simultaneous viewing. In the other condition, the electronic procedure viewer will share display real estate with the mode reconfiguration interface, forcing operates to view the two displays strictly sequentially. Effects on objective measures of fault management performance, such as checklist HRP -47065 REV B 569 completion time and accuracy, together with analyses of operators' information acquisition strategies (sequences of eye fixations), will provide a better understanding of how information acquisition and attentional allocation strategies are impacted by simultaneous versus sequential availability of fault - management display formats. Objective : \u00b7 Build on FY09 results to further understand operators' information acquisition behavi or while working systems malfunctions during high workload phases of flight . The approach for this study will be as follows: 1. Develop an empirical manipulation that meaningfully impacts operators' information acquisition strategies and attention allocation across display elements. The study will compare two conditions: one where the procedure viewer and system summary format occupy separate regions of the display unit, and another where these share display real estate. 2. Measure impact of empirical manipulation on operator's patterns of eye movements and associated decision- making activity. 3. Evaluate the impact of empirical manipulation on operator performance using Human Performance Model and compare model- based with actual performance. The foc us within each major subtask has been carefully selected to address either 1) a near -term identified need within ongoing Orion development work, or 2) a longer -term Exploration need that is sufficiently complex to warrant initiation of research. The research will result in the definition, refinement and validation of requirements necessary for the proper display and use of information related to systems monitoring and vehicle control. Deliverables: Requirements_Vehicle/Suit Design Evaluation of advanced concepts for electronic procedures formatting and fault management Summary report on impacts of serial versus parallel access to fault -management related display information on fault management performance. Report will include preliminary recommendations a nd guidelines for the size and content of the EPV window during ascent/entry operations. Development of procedure standards for display of electronic procedures Investigation and development of enhancements for current designs and capabilities Design guidance related to the number and location of procedure steps shown. Design guidance related to fault management Required Delivery Milestone: FY09: Procedure design recommendations for Orion HSIR Required Platforms: Laboratory Test beds Mockups Task: Information Presentation - Human Performance Modeling Short Title : Info Pres Responsible Organization: SHFH Supporting Organization: SHFE Funding Source : Directed Other gaps supported by this task: This task also addresses the Risk of Reduced Safety and Efficiency Due to an Inadequately Designed Vehicle, Environment, Tools, or Equipment and the Risk of Error Due to Poor Task Design In next -generation cockpits, there will be the capability to automate a wider spectrum of spacecraft operations that is the case today. When combined with the steady advances that are taking place in human- machine interface technologies, for any particular task or vehicle operation, the increasing options for human -machine functional allocation, and the increasing suite of interfaces that could HRP -47065 REV B 570 support those options, something close to a combinatorial explosion in the spac e of possible operational concepts and supporting interfaces is occurring. Both potential deficiencies with targeted designs, and optimal design solutions, could well be missed in a highly resource -limited development environment that targets only a small number of candidate designs for human-in -the-loop evaluation. Fully validated Human Performance Modeling tools could be used to more exhaustively explore and prune the design space for targeted operational concepts, particularly those that involve perfor mance shaping functions (such as vibration or sustained g) that render human-in -the-loop evaluations of more than a small handful of point solutions impractical. The goal of the Information Presentation Directed Research Project (DRP) is to address design questions related to the presentation of information to the crew. This includes not only the issues of information formatting, style, and layout, but also methods of interacting with the information, use of information under the extreme environments encountered in space travel, and refinement of human factors techniques, such as modeling, that will supplement traditional design techniques and help ensure that optimal information design is accomplished in the most cost -efficient manner.

The products proposed in this DRP will result in the development of guidelines, requirements, and validation techniques for advanced user interfaces currently contemplated for the various spacecraft systems being designed and developed under the Constellation program. The major areas of work, or subtasks, within this DRP are: 1) Displays, 2) Controls, 3) Procedures and Fault Management, and 4) Human Performance Modeling. The Human Performance Modeling subtask focuses on enhancement of a computational model (developed in prior FY effort) to simulate and predict human interaction with advanced information displays supporting next -generation vehicle operations concepts. Aim A. Enhance modeling and simulation capabilities of ARC Human Oculomotor Performance (HOP) Model. Continue enhancement of the hum an performance model to more accurately simulate fault management behavior by human operators . Objective: \u00b7 Continue enhancing capabilities of the HOP model to simulate human operator variability in task finishing times for fault management in a high-workloa d, dynamic phase -of-flight environment. Compare model -based performance against operator performance to refine model parameters and determine \"next -steps\" for model development and maturation. These activities are important \"way -points\" on the path to development of a validated predictive tool that can automate and streamline the process of designing, testing, evaluating, and verifying operational concepts for next -generation spacecraft. The approach for this activity will be as follows: 1. Systematically v ary HOP model parameters to generate sequences of information- acquisition events (eye fixations) and associated task -completion times that replicate the full range of variability in fault management task -finishing times obtained with human operators. 2. Extract and characterize sequences of information acquisition events from eye-movement recordings obtained during FY 07 human-in -the-loop evaluation of ACAWS concepts. 3. Compare model -based sequences to operator sequences to determine deltas (if any). Translate deltas into requirements for new model capabilities . The focus within each major subtask has been carefully selected to address either 1) a near -term identified need within ongoing Orion development work, or 2) a longer -term Exploration need that is sufficiently complex to warrant initiation of research. The research will offer enhancements to a computational model to simulate and predict human interaction with advanced information displays for future vehicle operations concepts Deliverables: Tool or Technology_Computational Models Capability to model effects of crewmember and vehicle vibration on fault management performance.

Perform human factors evaluations of off -nominal situation management with integrated interface display suite. Analyses of oculomotor behavior f rom Activity A to extend the stochastic capabilities of the ARC human performance model to the point where the model can accept, as input, a targeted spacecraft operational concept (such as fault detection, isolation, and recovery from an onboard systems malfunction) and generate the sequence of information acquisition activities (behavioral primitives) associated with performing the task. Also, initiate the process of expanding the model's capabilities to generate predictions of operational impacts of performance shaping functions such as cabin vibration. Validation and maturation of HOP model Comparison of HOP model to real human performance Required Delivery Milestone: FY09: Info to HIDH to update information on human performance modeling FY10: Info to HIDH to update information on human performance modeling Required Platforms: Ground: Laboratory Test beds Ground: Mockups SHFE 3.1.1.a: How can we develop objective training measures to determine operator proficiency during and after ground training ? Gap description : TBD Task: Spaceflight Resource Management Training Short Title : Training - SFRM Responsible Organization: SHFH Supporting Organization: SHFE Funding Source : Directed Other gaps supported by this task: N/A This proposal focuses on the final year of the current training research effort. Given that this effort has been the first of its kind, this first stage has seen the exploration of relevant issues and specific application domains within National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) space operations. The research area is large indeed and had to be narrowed down in order to be able to provide tangible results and implementable deliverables that could contribute to future space exploration missions. Thus, investing the fir st stage of this research effort in narrowly defining operational application domains and potentially useful research directions has been necessary. The coming final year which this proposal addresses solidifies the relationships between the research team and the operational organizations in the selected domains, as well as clearly focuses the research efforts in the directions identified. Ground-based pre-flight training and in- space just-in -time training and task rehearsal will continue to be an important driver for exploration missions. Because long-duration missions preclude the possibility of easily providing new crew members from the ground who have been specially trained on specific emerging problems, new tasks and new scientific or mission operati ons, crew members will have to be able to address all known and emerging mission needs. To meet that challenge, on -board HRP -47065 REV B 572 training systems will have to enhance the autonomy and effectiveness of exploration crews. We will continue to depend on the deep knowledge astronauts acquire of the idiosyncrasies of the flight systems they live with and the tasks they have to perform. However, given the nature of the missions, onboard training opportunities for individuals and teams will be necessary, such as in reco nfigurable training and mission rehearsal systems. These systems will enable the crews to keep their skill levels up to par and to develop new skills or practice new procedures to resolve new challenges as they arise. Increasing communication delays between crews and ground support mean that astronauts need to be prepared to handle the unexpected on their own. As crews become more autonomous, their potential span of control and required expertise is much larger. It is not possible to train for every eventuality ahead of time on the ground or maintain such skills across long intervals of disuse. New training approaches must be skill -based rather than task -based, emphasizing the acquisition of general skills such as avionics trouble -shooting, or even broade r skills such as creative problem solving. Furthermore, a team of experts is not necessarily an expert team. Thus, team training will be particularly important, and especially so for multicultural and international crews on long -duration missions. Research in many other high-risk domains (e.g., aviation, the military, nuclear power and medicine) shows that effective teamwork can provide resilience in the face of challenging problems. The same is true for the people of Launch and Mission Control, particularl y as mission complexity increases and resources available for training decrease. The current length of crew and flight controllers training has been identified as a major issue in various crew reports and debriefs and it is predicted that future training will have to be more efficient. Leveraging from the investigation of existing training and the analysis of current training principles and approaches conducted under this Directed Research Project (DRP) so far, a forward plan is proposed for FY10. Specific ally, the proposal focuses on exploring some of the basics of learning and of skill acquisition and retention, as well as their practical implementation in two distinct target operations that provide a broad basis for principles and methodologies relevant for all aspects of NASA's Exploration mission: mission control, and medical operations. Because validating training implementations and particularly those aimed at the long-term retention of skills takes time, this research must maintain its timeline so as to have finalized products in time to meet Constellation Program (CxP) needs. What's more, intermediate products from this research effort benefit current missions and allow for iterative improvement cycles with continuous feedback from key stakeholders. The proposed Space Medical work will extend the work done in FY08 and FY09 to develop a prototype Flight Surgeon performance support tool. This tool is designed to support the performance of Flight Surgeons while on console at NASA's Mission Control Cente r (MCC), and especially in cases of emergency on board a space vehicle. Some existing International Space Station (ISS) electronic displays will also benefit from this work. In addition, the relevant Computer Based Training literature will be compared wit h existing NASA requirements and guidelines in order to propose additional requirements based if gaps are found. Specific Aims: AIM A. Determine the state-of -the-art in medical training technologies (ARC led). 1. This study will entail a review of current medical training technologies used by medical schools, hospitals, and medical training organizations. The review will include searches of the literature and the web, as well as direct contacts with leading medical schools, particularly those that use advanc ed technologies and distance learning. 2. An analysis will be done to determine state-of -the-art medical training technologies that might be relevant to NASA's mission. T his review will help in creating improved training programs which combine multiple train ing techniques. Such programs allow trainees to use multiple sensory modalities and to engage the material from different perspectives, thus ensuring an effective and stable knowledge acquisition and retention. 3. A report summarizing the results of this stu dy will be submitted to the SHFE Project by 6/30/2010 (Visibility). This study will feed into the Advanced Training Materials and Medical Procedures Integrated Control milestone to be delivered to the SD Customer by the end of the 4th HRP -47065 REV B 573 Quarter of FY10. AIM B. Determine correspondence between current Computer -Based Training (CBT) standards and NASA CBT guidelines (JSC led) . 1. This study will entail a review of current standards and specifications for CBT practiced in the industry and by public and private training and educational organizations. These standards and specifications will then be compared with existing NASA CBT guidelines. In particular, CBT practices will be evaluated in light of NASA's needs. An analysis of differences and similarities between the different standards will be done and recommendations for NASA CBT guidance will be developed. 2. A report summarizing the results of this study will be submitted to the SHFE Project by 3/31/2010 (Visibility). This study will feed into the Advanced Training Materials and Medical Procedures Integrated Control milestone to be delivered to the SD Customer by the end of the 4th Quarter of FY10. 5.2 AIM C. Determine the feasibility of a computer implementation of the paper prototype Flight Surgeon Performance S upport tool developed in FY09 (JSC led). 1. This study will extend the work done in FY08 and FY09 to develop a prototype Flight Surgeon performance support tool in the form of a one -pager to be used in emergency situations on board the ISS. The tool is designed to provide a single reference point for the flight Surgeon on console and includes immediate actions, the relevant Flight Rules, and information needed to be provided or requested. The current prototype uses Fire Onboard the ISS as a sample emergency , and has been developed in collaboration with our Medical Operations Stakeholder. The FY10 work will determine the feasibility of an electronic implementation of the current prototype to enable Flight Surgeons to carry the tool on their laptop computers which they bring with them to Mission Control Center (MCC) when they have console duties. 2. A report describing the methodology for an electronic implementation of the prototype Flight Surgeon performance support tool, as well as the requirements and speci fications will feed into the Advanced Training Materials and Medical Procedures Integrated Control milestone to be delivered to the SD Customer by the end of the 4th Quarter of FY10. AIM D. Determine the basic steps and processes involved in MCC Flight Co ntroller problem solving and decision making activities (ARC led). 1. This study will document current practices in ISS Flight Controller (FCer) problem solving and decision making process. Traditionally in MOD, these skills were not taught explicitly but expected to be developed through participation in simulations and by observing experienced FCers. With the desire to reduce the length of the training for newly hired FCers, and the need to reduce the number of simulations used in training, FCers would have fewer opportunities to observe and absorb effective strategies of problem solving and decision making in MCC. Thus, an effective method of explicitly training these skills is necessary. As a basis for developing such a method, current practices must be documented and analyzed. 2. The proposed study will utilize cognitive interviews with experienced FCers, observations during MCC operations and full mission simulations, and analysis of historical data from challenging situations during space operations. The result will be a prototype model of FCer's problem solving and decision making process. 3. The prototype model of FCer's problem solving and decision making process will be submitted as an SFRM Tool Control milestone to the MOD Customer by the end of the 4 th Quarter of FY10. HRP -47065 REV B 574 The approach taken in the proposal and the particular products pursued are the result of close collaboration with Mission Operations Directorate and Space Medicine training organizations. Significant progress has been made in the past 3 years. For FY10, products from this study will include prototype Mission Operations Directorate training protocols and tools, as well as recommendations for the design of Space Medicine medical training and checklists incorporating decision support functions. Deliverables: Technology or Tool/Tools Develop an MOD-specific non -technical (i.e., independent of spacecraft systems) framework (such as a game structure) that can be used to train SFRM skills (such as situation awareness, communication, and decision -making). Development of training events using the SFRM Paper Sim that could be used to reliably predict the likelihood of a trainee's success in acquiring good SFRM skills.

The proposed Space Medical work will extend the work done in FY08 and FY09 to develop a HRP -47065 REV B 576 prototype Flight Surgeon performance support tool. This tool is designed to support the performance of Flight Surgeons while on console at NASA's Mission Control Center (MCC), and e specially in cases of emergency on board a space vehicle. Some existing International Space Station (ISS) electronic displays will also benefit from this work. In addition, the relevant Computer Based Training literature will be compared with existing NASA requirements and guidelines in order to propose additional requirements based if gaps are found. For FY10, products from this study will include recommendations for the design of Space Medicine medical training and checklists incorporating decision support functions. The results from this research will provide a framework for \"just in time\" training tools that can be applied to increasingly autonomous flight operations for long duration missions.

Evaluation of the Flight Surgeon Performance Support Tool prototype - \"Flight Surgeon Response to ISS Emergencies.\" A detailed task analysis examining the role of the flight surgeon during an on-board emergency will be completed. The task analysis will contribute to updated design options. Computer implementation for Just -in-Time training - The paper prototype that will be evaluated in FY09 will be implemented in a computer program in FY10. This implementation will allow the Flight Surgeon to have access to the tool on their laptop computers, and will allow us to embed layer s of information providing further details beyond the necessary immediate actions. A training continuum spans a full range from initial training, to recurrent and refresher training, to just - in-time training. FY10 explores the issues relevant to refresher training.

When flying aircraft, pilots sometimes experience dangerous spatial disorientation (SD) issues including leans, Coriolis, and graveyard spiral illusions, and disparities between actual and perceived pitch attitude , roll rate or yaw rate. Originally developed for aeronautical use, work is being performed to extend SD mitigation software developed for use in the Shuttle, Crew Exploration Vehicle, Lunar Surface Access Module, and Mars exploration mission programs. HRP -47065 REV B 577 The goal of this industry -university research and development project is to extend Alions spatial disorientation mitigation software, originally developed for aeronautical use, to NASAs space applications including the Shuttle, Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) , Altair and Mars exploration missions. Alions spatial disorientation analysis tool (SDAT) is designed for post hoc analyses of aircraft trajectory data from U.S. Navy, Air Force and National Transportation Safety Board mishaps to determine the presence o r absence of vestibular spatial disorientation (SD). Spatial orientation aiding system (SOAS) is a real -time cockpit aid that has been evaluated in simulators with rated pilots. Both tools incorporate models of the vestibular system and assessor heuristics to predict the epoch and probability of an SD event such as leans, coriolis or graveyard spiral illusions, as well as any other significant disparities between actual and perceived pitch attitude (somatogravic), roll rate or yaw/heading rate. SOAS assesses multi-sensory workload to determine the types of countermeasures to trigger and when to trigger them. Project Aims 1. Enhance the utility of SDAT/SOAS by including appropriate mathematical models for vestibular and visual sensory cues, and CNS gravito -inertial force resolution into perceived tilt and translation estimates from Massachusetts Institute of Technologys (MIT) Observer model, and revalidating it using existing aeronautical data sets. 2. Extend the models to describe zero gravity, Shuttle, and Altair landing illusions, validating the models using Shuttle and Altair simulator data sets, current theories (e.g., rotation otolith tilt- translation reinterpretation (ROTTR) observer or Bayesian particle filter), as well as archived Apollo lunar module data , if available. 3. Extend SDAT/SOAS to consider multiple visual frames of reference, the effects of visual attention and sensory workload, and the cognitive costs of mental rotation and reorientation. The enhanced SDAT/SOAS from Aims 1 -3 will be validated via simulator and/or flight experiments. 4. SOAS will be tailored for a lunar landing, using multi-sensory workload to choose appropriate countermeasures and their timing. Countermeasures will include one or more of the following, as conditions warrant: control command displays; two -dimensional and perspective synthetic/enhanced vision displays; attitude indicator formats tailored for physically redirected, off velocity vector viewing; and auditory cues and commands. SDAT will also help human factors engineers analyze the following: past Shuttle landing incidents; Orion/CEV/Altair landing and ascent trajectory planning; Altair cockpit displays, and caution and warning system design; workload evaluation; and crew training and mission simulation. SDAT could assist flight surgeons with post -flight medical debriefings. Earth-based Applications of Research Project Over 15 percent of all aircraft accidents are attributable to spatial disorientation, with particularly high prevalence in night military and general aviation operations. Better understanding of the motion patterns leading to spatial disorientation (SD) and potential in -flight warnings and improved displays could reduce this danger. All lessons learned and enhancements to spatial disorientation analysis tool (SDAT) and spatial orientation aiding system (SOAS) from this project will be applied to aviation. In particular, the addition of otolith models to SDAT and SOAS will be useful in analyzing rotary wing SD events and devising appropriate countermeasure strategies within SOAS for this class of vehicles. The new frame of reference transformation tool is intended as a design aid for all vehicle control - display engineers. The tool will help designers objectively assess the costs of frame-of -reference transform ations in terms of increased workload, slower response times and more control reversal errors. Deliverables: Technology or Tools_Computational Models Enhance the utility of SDAT/SOAS by including comprehensive mathematical models for vestibular and visua l sensory cues, help translate CNS gravitoinertial force resolution into perceived tilt and translation estimates, and revalidate existing aeronautical data sets Extend the models to describe zero gravity and Shuttle/LSAM landing illusions, validating the models using Shuttle data sets and existing (e.g. ROTTR) theory Extend SDAT/SOAS to consider multiple visual frames of reference (inside and outside), panel and heads-up (HUD) orientation displays, the effects of visual attention and sensory workload, and the cognitive costs of mental rotation and reorientation.

Spatial disorientation occurs when a person has a perception of direction, position and size that do not agree with reality. Sense of such information can have serious consequences for the crew and mission operations. Astronauts will be susceptible spatial disorientation during lunar mission operations caused by reduced gravity and other factors. The goal of this project is to develop a Lunar Astronaut Spatial Orientation and Information System (LASOIS) that will enhance astronauts' spatial orientation capability and reduce sensorimotor risks during future manned lunar mission operations. Supported by LAS OIS, astronauts will be capable of overcoming disorientation in lunar surface operations caused by microgravity and the altered visual environment through spatial information provided by the Earth control center and collected by a coordinated group of sens ors from lunar orbit, descending path and ground. The developed spatial orientation strategy, system, and training will allow astronauts to have a systematic preparation for complex mission scenarios where spatial operations, efficient interactions and co mmunications are required among the Earth-based control center, lander(s), lunar vehicle(s), outposts and astronauts. This capability is extremely important for lunar operations that will have an extensive traversing region (around 100 km). Objectives 1. Investigate methods for removal and/or alleviation of astronaut disorientation during lunar surface operations by using integrated information technology, and psychological and cognitive research on spatial orientation and navigation. 2. Develop the LASOIS. 3. Train astronauts to enhance their spatial orientation capability in a LASOIS -supported simulated lunar environment. Supported by LASOIS, astronauts on the lunar surface will be capable of overcoming disorientation caused by microgravity and the altered visual environment through spatial information provided by the Earth control center and collected by a coordinated group of sensors from lunar orbit, descending path and ground. The developed spatial orientation strategy, system and training will allow astrona uts to have a systematic preparation for complex mission scenarios where spatial operations and efficient interactions and communications are required among the Earth -based control center, lander(s), lunar HRP -47065 REV B 579 vehicle(s), outposts and astronauts. This capabili ty is extremely important for lunar operations that will have an extensive traversing region. Earth-based Applications of Research Project The Lunar Astronaut Spatial Orientation and Information System (LASOIS) will greatly enhance an astronauts spatial -orientation capabilities, reduce or even eliminate disorientation problems, decrease sensorimotor risks and ultimately improve astronaut performance and safety while on the lunar surface. It will be the first time that such a spatial -orientation and informat ion system was developed and used to improve human performance and human-robotic interaction capabilities in manned missions. Valuable expertise and experience accumulated during the research and development process, especially, the analog field test of th e LASOIS system will significantly contribute to improvement of existing scientific strategies. The outputs of this project will provide NASA with data and knowledge supporting lunar surface science and lunar operations scenarios and will aid the understan ding and optimization of human performance capabilities to maximize scientific return in future lunar missions. With applications developed on the lunar surface, the system could be further extended to support Mars manned missions in the future. In addition, the developed technologies can also be used to support personal navigation on Earth. Other applications include environmental monitoring, military operations, and complex spatial sensor and sensor network research. Risks can be significantly reduced b y improving the spatial orientation capability through use of the proposed LASOIS system. This project directly supports the key sensorimotor risk by providing the advanced LASOIS to reduce/remove the disorientation risk. Deliverables: Technology or Tools_ Tools/Simulations To investigate methods for removal and/or alleviation of astronaut disorientation in a lunar surface operations setting by using integrated information technology, and psychological and cognitive research on spatial orientation and na vigation; To develop the LASOIS; and To train astronauts to enhance their spatial orientation capability in a LASOIS-supported simulated lunar environment.

It will be important for astronaut pilots to overcome sensorimotor diff iculties they may encounter should they switch from auto-pilot to manual control during lunar landing operations. The problems they may face include disorientation in the reduced gravity of the moon and difficulty in seeing and interpreting the moons terra in. Lunar landing depends on the selection and identification of an appropriate location that is level and free of hazards, along with a stable, controlled descent to the surface. During crewed landings, astronauts are expected to interact with automated systems, based upon improved terrain maps and sensor updates, to perform tasks such as manual re-designation of landing point, adjustment of descent trajectory or direct manual control. However, sensorimotor limitations, both vestibular and visual, are likely to interfere with performance and safety. This integrated project examines the nature of the anticipated spatial disorientation and terrain perception limits as they affect the transition from automatic to manual control and develops advanced display countermeasures to overcome these limitations. There are four specific aims investigated in this multi -institution effort: 1. Examine the nature of anticipated sensorimotor difficulties (e.g., spatial disorientation, limits on terrain perception) as they affect the transition from automatic to manual control; 2. Develop and evaluate advanced display countermeasures for enhancing situation and terrain awareness and for overcoming performance limitations caused by reduced visibility associated with lunar lighting, terrain reflectivity and the absence of atmosphere utilizing Draper Laboratory's fixed -base lunar lander cockpit simulator for full human-in -the-loop evaluation; 3. Evaluate the effectiveness of the cockpit displays during human-in -the-loop manual control i n the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) Tilt-Translation Sled (TTS) during \"critical\" and \"hover\" tasks testing the tilt -translation and tilt-gain illusions of altered acceleration sensitivity as it applies to lunar gravity following a period of weightlessne ss; and 4. Perform a series of evaluations of the displays using the U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratorys six -degree-of -freedom helicopter simulator as a lunar landing analog for replicating lunar lighting and the various parameters associated with dust \"brownout\" conditions. Earth-based Applications of Research Project Human rating requirements currently mandate the capability for a \"graceful reversion\" from automated to manual control for spaceflight control systems. Our goal is to determine the limits of human performance under likely landing conditions that may cause spatial disorientation. Appropriate roles can thereby be selected for humans and automated systems. This proposed project will contribute to a better understanding of visual and vestibul ar conditions contributing to spatial disorientation during landing and the resulting effects on human manual control. We will have demonstrated display and control system interfaces to reduce pilot workload, improve situation awareness and mitigate spatial disorientation to ensure a safe crewed lunar landing. Finally, the work may also have terrestrial applications in mitigating the risk of helicopter accidents by suggesting new techniques to address problems associated with brownout during landing. The research will be using results from these efforts to provide guidance toward requirements development.

Improved training methods provide a framework for designing future in-flight training procedures during long-duration missions. The project will demonstrate how individual differences affect performance of a critical operational skill and will provide initial designs of interfaces t o controls and displays, and procedures that better match the operators' cognitive skills with task demands. The goal is to improve the efficiency of robotic training through the modification of current procedures and development of new teaching tools. The long term objectives of this project are: 1. to develop tests of astronaut spatiomotor abilities that predict the need for remedial training or performance in final telerobotic qualification tests; 2. improve teleoperation training techniques and 3. develop new teleoperator interfaces that improve the efficiency of teleoperation training and flight operations. This research will begin to demonstrate the matching of individual operator cognitive skill with the task demands of teleoperation. This research will focus upon robotic systems. Many other task demands may be able to take advantage of the results, and future research will need to be defined. The long-term objectives of this four -year project address three specific aims related to human performance during space telerobotics training. We are collaborating with the Johnson Space Center Robotic Systems Training Group. The project is in its second year. Specific Aims 1. Our goal is to improve NASA teleoperation training efficiency by scientifically customizing remedial training based on the measured spatial abilities of individual astronauts. Astronaut robotics trainees vary significantly in their initial performance, ability, learning rate and level of mastery. Because the process of training astronauts to be qualified robotics operators is so long and expensive, NASA needs tools to predict robotics performance prior to training. NASAs existing Aptitude for Robotics Test (ART) had not been statistically validated, however this project is assessing and proposing updates to ART to improve its capabilities. Also, included as part of this aim is testing of the mental rotation and perspective taking spatial abilities of 40 active astronauts who had completed at least one robotics training course. Logistic regression models that predicted who would achieve the top score in qualification evaluations have been utilized and the model predictions appear reliable enough to be used to customize regular and remedial training but not to make career defining decisions. The models could not reliably predict who would completely fail because so few did. We have proposed improvements in GRT scoring methodology that should improve prediction reliability. Also being evaluated, is whether GRT scores could be used to predict performan ce in later training (e.g. Space Station Remote Manipulator), or under operational conditions on the International Space Station (ISS). HRP -47065 REV B 582 2. The second major objective is to perform experiments using a space telerobotics training simulator at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to quantify how a trainees individual spatial and manual control abilities, use of camera views and hand -controller reference frame impacts learning and final level of performance as both a primary and secondary robotics operator . We hypothesized that individual ability to manipulate the arm and integrate camera views correlates with three subcomponents of spatial intelligence: spatial visualization (SV), mental rotation (MR) and perspective taking (PT). In particular, PT (the ability to imagine an object from another viewpoint) was thought to be important for integrating camera views. 3. The third major goal is to identify and develop new interfaces and tools to support future in- space, lunar surface teleoperation and teleoperation training. The original 2007 plan was to develop an adjunct spatial situation display and a scheme for switching camera views using operator gestures. The year will focus on bimanual control skill assessment while acquiring the necessary tracking hardware and will address gesture control or spatial situation displays during Year 4. Earth-based Applications of Research Project Our goal is to improve the efficiency of robotic training via improvement of current pedagogies and development of new teaching tools. Improved training methods provide a framework for designing future in -flight training procedures during long-duration missions. The project will also demonstrate how individual differences in spatial and bimanual control skills affect performance of a cr itical operational skill and provide initial designs of controls, displays and procedures that better match the operator's cognitive skills with task demands. Deliverables: Standards_Update Scientifically customized remedial training based on the measur ed spatial abilities of individual astronauts. The research will have examined whether NASA JSC's current Aptitude for Robotics Test (ART) predicts the need for remedial work in Generic Robotic Training (GRT) and Shuttle manipulator training or whether additional psychometric tests will sharpen performance predictions. A series of experiments using the MIT Remote Manipulation System Simulator to quantify how a trainees individual spatial and manual control abilities, use of camera views and choice of hand controller reference frame impacts learning and final level of performance as a primary operator. Secondary operator performance in a clearance detection and estimation task is assessed using a signal detection/situation awareness probe paradigm.

A better system for creation of intelligent simulations will be needed to prepare future crews for the rigors ahead. The software syste m proposed will create a method for authoring intelligent 3D simulations for training and operations support without the need for high-level programming. An authoring tool of this type will allow NASA subject matter experts to capture their knowledge and build a simulation from it, or allow developers to create scenario -based simulations for troubleshooting and repair. This tool will also be more cost effective than hardware. A specific and immediate use will be for EVA training, particularly when a EVA or IVA task needs to designed during a mission and the simulation delivered just prior to execution. The wide range of tasks that must be performed by a very small crew calls for the ability to develop just in time training methods. Remote and more autonomous outposts will require the crew to operate more independently from ground support, and with 6 month missions will not be able to train for all possible tasks including contingency repairs. This task will focus on: 1. Establishing guidelines for determining what types of training are appropriate for on board training, 2. Establishing methods to develop and evaluate training materials. 3. Expansion of earlier work in efficiently authoring graphical training materials 4. Developing metrics for training materials Objectives and Deliverables: Fully functional NASA Astronaut training system. After a successful tool test is complete, training materials and user -guide documentation will be completed. This will allow PLANET LLC to train a number of NASA personnel on the system, and prepare the software for commercial release. This research and development will begin to frame the types of tools that can be used by crewmembers in the support of long duration missions. As mission durations are defined, and the full extent o f what the crew is expected to perform is identified, additional tools/methods/types can be developed. Deliverables: Technology or Tools_ Tools/Simulations Review of state of the art in training authoring tools Requirements and guidelines for use in developing training materials for use future missions Required Delivery Milestone: FY09: Delivery of application to SD for use in T2 installation FY10: Documentation on recommendations and guidelines for development of training materials for future space missions Required Platforms: Ground: Laboratory Testbeds Ground: Mockups Gap: HCI -3: design constraints for cockpits and workstations, what HCI guidelines (e.g., display configuration, screen -navigation) will enable the crew to perform tasks in a timely manner with minimal ergonomic problems, even when fatigued or deconditioned?

Recent cockpit design/prototyping efforts uncovered (but did not resolve) important i ssues that must be addressed for these types of vehicles - e.g., information architecture for limited display real estate; allocation of functions to hardware vs. software controls; intuitive ways to manage cursor control device, keypad, and cursor knob inputs; and cursor movement styles and paths. The task will develop: 1. A testbed of displays and controls will be developed that will contain approximately 40 displays demonstrating proposed design solutions for some of the challenges mentioned above. The testbed can be used for technology demonstrations, and be available to HRP researchers for investigating other human- system interaction issues such as electronic procedures; levels of automation; and crew situation awareness. 2. The result of this effort will b e empirically -based designs that provide safe, usable interfaces for the crew. These demonstrated designs can be developed into requirements for future vehicle cockpits. 3. As the testbed matures, it will also serve as a mechanism to identify additional knowledge gaps that must be addressed in the area of advanced spacecraft cockpit design. Existing hardware and software in the JSC/CB Rapid Prototyping Lab will be leveraged to jumpstart the effort. Heavy crew interest in this type of project means increased crew willingness to participate as subjects in the research, and crew advocacy for implementation of results in future programs. This task will begin to define the human -computer interaction guidelines necessary for the design of future spacecraft or vehic le cockpits.

Rather than draw a hard distinction between teleops and autonomous robots, we propose a graceful transition among the control modes. Validated interface guidelines are needed in time to support Lunar teleoperations Our research will employ perceptual -guided control modeling and human-in -the-loop testing to establish operators' tolerance for transmission lags under a variety of control paradigms and int erface augmentations. Our specific aims include: 1. develop a model characterizing latency tolerances of perceptual modalities for sets of control regimes; 2. use this model to develop and verify a taxonomy of control regimes; 3. develop preliminary guidelines for compensatory interfaces; 4. refine and validate guidelines for compensatory interfaces. The development of validated interface guidelines for teleoperations will greatly mitigate the impact of transmission delays where possible, and inform designers when these delays exceed compensatory mechanism and more outer -loop control paradigms are required.

This risk may relate to interaction between multiple crewmembers, to interactions between crew, robotics, and automation, and between crew and ground control. Understanding the characteristics of the elements involved, how each communicates, and establishing guidelines to adhere to during task design and procedure development are all essential to mission success. Operational Relevanc e and Risk Context One of the most critical enablers of human presence in space is human systems standards that provide for crew health as well as standards for habitability, environmental, and human factors. The Space Flight Human System Standards - SFHSS - (and the companion Human Integration Design Handbook - HIDH) require that each human spaceflight program derive program -specific, verifiable requirements to comply with the standards, and require that each human spaceflight program establish a human factors process involving health and human factors experts. This is to ensure identification of any standards in the SFHSS that are not applicable (or altered) and the rationale for non-applicability; that all program level health and human factors requireme nts are based on the HIDH, cited empirical evidence, or known best practices; and that end-items are in compliance with SFHSS, and agency and program level requirements and specifications. The activities cited reflect the need to work toward the mitigation of identified SHFE risks by continuing to inform the standards, by engagement in the development of the requirements that will implement the standards based upon the resulting products, as well as providing content to the HIDH that will serve as the implementation guide. In addition, products resulting from these activities may provide valuable information to spaceflight programs that can inform the requests for trade studies. To ensure operational relevance of the deliverables from the tasks, all tasks leaders will identify stakeholders who will work with them in framing the questions and approach. The stakeholders will participate by identifying specific issues requiring research or technology development, by reviewing progress, and by suggesting operat ional evaluations. Depending on the specific tasks, stakeholders may include engineers or operations personnel. Strategy for Mitigation The approach to mitigating this risk is to develop an understanding of the factors that contribute to this risk, identify gaps in our knowledge about these factors, and prioritize these gaps based on various criteria systematically applied. Then the highest priority gaps are addressed through directed or solicited research depending on the time frame and the complexity an d specificity of the gap. Where there is a disconnect between critical gaps that should be addressed and a lack of funding, efforts are made to re-examine the programmatic priorities to ensure those of highest concern are being investigated. The risk associated with designing tasks focuses specifically on the process of assigning roles and responsibilities to individual crewmembers, a group of crewmembers, automation, and ground support alone or in combination. The Behavioral Health and Performance Element has primary responsibility for addressing risks related to team dynamics. SHFE specifically studies issues in designing tasks to be performed jointly by humans and automation, or deciding how much responsibility to assign to an automated system. The approach to mitigating this risk is to develop and specify \"best practices\" for HRP -47065 REV B 594 human-automation function allocation; -crew-automation interface design, how to incorporate considerations of crew workload and situational awareness in mixed -initiative operations concept design, and determining methods to ensure effective levels of trust between the crew and automation while avoiding unacceptable levels of crew complacency. The strategy for addressing this risk is intertwined with the strategies for addressing the Risk of Reduced Safety and Efficiency Due to an Inadequately Designed Vehicle, Environment, Tools or Equipment, and the Risk of Errors due to Inadequate Information. The work described under this risk focuses on planning how a given task or mission objective will be accomplished. This risk addresses how to decide what skills, tools, equipment and information are needed to accomplish a task, and what amounts of automation or human involvement are required. The Risk Due to an Inadequately Designed Vehi cle, Environment, Tools, or Equipment captures the factors that lead to inappropriate human interfaces for the habitat and equipment. Work under the Risk of Errors due to Inadequate Information contributes to the crew having adequate knowledge, skills, and information at the time the task needs to be performed. The specific selection choices of the highest priority gaps and tasks are based primarily on gap analyses. The SHFE project updates its gap analyses on an annual basis. This is necessary as research results and continual information drawn from crew debriefings has the potential of discovering additional gaps in knowledge. These updates assist in the preparation for the annual Standing Review Panel. The original analysis carried out in 2006 was published as NASA/TP -2007- 213739 (\"Space Human Factors Engineering Gap Analysis Project Final Report,\" C. Hudy and B. Woolford, 2007). An update was completed in spring 2007. The gaps are identified through reviews of the literature, of crew debrief summaries, and through interviews with more than a hundred users of human factors standards and guidelines, representing Engineering, Mission Operations, Flight Medicine, Training, the Crew Office, and others. We place particular emphasis on interviewing repr esentatives from Constellation Program Office, the Human -System Integration Group, the Orion Project Office, the Cockpit Display Working Group, and other programmatic users of our products. The 'small' gaps or specific concerns identified from these sources are aggregated into more appropriate levels for which a specific task can be designed. For example, numerous users report gaps in design for workload: lack of consistency of definition; lack of easy to use methods to assess workload; lack of a way to verify that a requirement for workload has been met. These various individual -level concerns are captured in a gap, \"There is no standardized non - intrusive measure of workload.\" As part of the integrated Performance Change - Behavioral Health, SHFE anticipates funding two tasks related to the acquisition and analysis of task performance data onboard the ISS. The goal of these tasks is to provide robust, in situ space operations data for SHFE researchers. One of the tasks will be a directed, in-house ef fort; its focus will be on the integration of data acquisition tools and the secure capture, storage, and redaction of performance data; this task has an anticipated start date of FY14. The second task will be a competed effort to develop robust analysis tools to develop and verify predictive models of performance; this task is also slated for an FY14 start. After all concerns are mapped to gaps, the gaps are prioritized according to a number of criteria. Key criteria are importance to Constellation Progr am and need date. When we identify 'TBRs' or 'TBDs' in the Human Systems Integration Requirements, for example, these are assigned a very high priority. Ratings are solicited from management representatives of the offices from which gaps were identified. After prioritization, the gaps that can be addressed within the budget are initiated through directed research or solicited through research announcements. Directed research is chosen for time critical results. Solicitations are used for gaps that are longer term and that can benefit from wider participation. HRP -47065 REV B 595 Gaps Gap: SHFE 1.1.2.1.1: How can performance, efficiency and safety guidelines be developed for appropriate task automation and the effective allocation of tasks between humans and automation? Gap Description TBD Task: Automation Interface Design Tools Development Short Title : AIDTD Responsible Organization: SHFH Supporting Organization: SHFE Funding Source : HRP/Directed Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Traditional techniques for the design and evaluation of automation interfaces rely on subject -matter- experts, human -in-the-loop testing (i.e. usability testing), guidelines, heuristics and rules -of-thumb. Given the volume and time -line for the development of new automation required for space exploration, the time and cost required to perform manual design reviews by human factor experts will be prohibitive. State of the art cognitive science and Human -Automation Interaction (HAI) approaches may provide the type of analysis needed, but are not currently usable by designers without extensive cognitive science expertise. The automation design community needs methods that are usable by designers early in the design process to meet the demands for the development and testing of automation required for space exploration. The objective of this research project is to develop a set of methodologies and tools to support the design and evaluation of the human-computer interaction process. The research plan is to integrate existing foundational research results into HAI methods and tools usable by designers. This work is divided into three areas, with the ultimate goal of developing a suite of tools to support each area. It is important to note that the idea of the project is to develop and evaluate t he tools in actual design processes, and the level and type of support and evaluation will be dependent upon the scope and maturity of each design domain. The three areas are organized around the primary foci of the design process. 1. Analyze: The first set of methods and tools are intended to help designers to identify, describe and evaluate the different parts of the job. Depending on the stage of the design process, these methods are referred to as work domain analyses, task decompositions, task analyses, knowledge elicitation, and in the later stages, validation. 2. Formulate: The second set of methods and tools is intended to bridge the gap from the analysis of the work domain. Specifically, once the structure of the work domain and tasks has been determined , methods and tools are needed to link the task structures to corresponding interface structures that can later be refined and evaluated. 3. Build: This set of methods and tools are intended to enable rapid development and evaluation of automation, including the user-interface and the underlying automation behavior. The specific focus of this effort is to develop methods and tools that are usable by designers who are expert in the design domain, but aren't necessarily formally trained in computer programming, or human performance analysis. The outcomes of this research will be methods and tools for the automation of the design and evaluation of the automation interfaces. These tools will provide the means to: 1. meet the demand for analysis required for space exploration development time -line, 2. enable increased iterative human factors testing of automation prototypes early in the design process 3. reduce the cost of development by design and testing of proposed systems early in the development life -cycle 4. reduce the cost of training and the maintenance of proficiency 5. improve safety (and reduce the costs of inefficiency and unsafe operations) through significant reduction in failure to complete task metrics. Deliverables: Technology or Tool _Tools Documentation of Application Domain - To adequately model the process and perform the task HRP -47065 REV B 596 decomposition, researchers have to develop a deep knowledge of the domain, the process, and culture of the organization. This is vital to ensuring that the resulting method/toolset i s compatible with the end-users enterprise environment. Process Modeling and Metrics Instrumentation- To develop process information and metrics that adequately describe characteristics of Human Automation Interaction performance. Task Decomposition - Cont inue to develop and validate a usable task decomposition and analysis application Human Performance Modeling - A human performance analysis capability that does not require Human Automation Interaction expertise to use. The intention is that the required data for the tool will be generated by the task decomposition and analysis tool Tool Integration - Develop and validate an automation prototyping environment that is useful for Constellation. Integrate the methods that have been developed in the previous t asks into tool suites that are usable by designers without requiring extensive Human Computer Interaction expertise. Provide quantitative assessments of the performance of an automation design and its interface for a specific task on a given design. Demon stration & Testing - All of the studies are focused on delivering tools to help designers make better Human -Automation Interaction decisions early in the operations concept design process. Specifically, as described earlier, the first year of the task will focus on developing tools that are usable by the ISS Attitude Direction and Control team. Assessment of new technology and capabilities - Evaluation of new tools that can enhance developed tools to further aid users in allocation of tasks. Additionally, test and validate enhancements in simulated environments to determine efficacy and applicability.

They may also work in teams consisting of multiple crews and robots, requiring special strategies and interaction. Developing well - designed human-robot teams is essential to ensure safe and efficient operations, and lower lifecycle costs while achieving mission objectives. There is a need to develop tools for measuring usability and effectiveness of HRI, including standard techniques, metrics, and strategies in order to optimize human -robot team performance. These tools can be developed by understanding the variables that affect human-robot performance in existing operations, such as level of automation, team management, end-effect or manipulation, communications, interface design, and feedback. An integrated evaluation toolkit and guidelines for HRI can provide systematic ways to develop future human -robot teams and identify ways to increase the efficiency of existing teams. This directed task will: 1. Perform extensive review, evaluations, and integration of tools to understand and measure the variables that affect human -robot interaction (HRI) performance, usability, situational HRP -47065 REV B 597 awareness, workload, a nd the human's mental models accuracy. 2. A literature review will be used to identify the major variables that affect HRI. 3. Current tools used to evaluate HRI (e.g., performance metrics, workload measures, function allocation) will be assessed through exist ing human-robot teams. 4. The tools identified as effective for assessing such teams will be integrated and new tools, such as surveys, checklists, and scales will be developed to fill in gaps. A systematic manipulation of variables (e.g., level of automatio n, number of robots, feedback) will be used to validate tools and methods. 5. The final deliverable will be a unified toolkit of methods and guidelines to assess and develop human-robot teams for a range of applications. As longer duration missions will find the crew in an environment where dependence upon robots will become a normal part of executing mission objectives, this research will begin to provide tools necessary to build the appropriate allocation of tasks between multi -agent teams , Deliverables: Technology or Tools_ Tools/Simulations Evaluation toolkits, methods, and guidelines for assessing and developing human -robot teams Required Delivery Milestone : FY11: Investigation of existing agency -wide human -robot teamwork and training.

Required Platforms: Ground Task: Human - Automation Interactions and Performance Analysis of Lun ar Lander Supervisory Control (NSBRI) Short Title : Lunar Lander Responsible Organization: SHFH Supporting Organization: SHFE Funding Source : NSBRI Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Landing a spacecraft on the moon is a complex and challenging endeavor. Safe and precise lunar landing will require complex and seamless interactions between the astronauts and the vehicle automation. This level of involvement will change from lunar orbit through terminal descent to touchdown. Although the exact tasks f or the astronaut and the automation have yet to be specified, we can begin to define human -automation task allocation and model and predict supervisory control performance. This research will quantify the effects of both human and automation errors as they propagate through a supervisory control system, as well as the effects of information display on mission and pilot -vehicle system performance through dynamic modeling and experimentation. This project will investigate the effects of both automation errors and inappropriate human actions as they spread through a complex system, such as a lunar lander. Additionally, it also develop models that represent the human's interaction with these types of systems to understand the effects of the information displays on the ability of the pilot to control the vehicle. The end result of the project will be a design tool that can be used to identify the appropriate task allocation between the human and automated control, as well as the information displays that are required for safe and successful lunar landings. Specific Aims Perform a critical analysis of Apollo human -automation interactions and task allocation during terminal descent through touchdown, as well as the information requirements, decision making process and selection of action. 1. Develop a closed -loop pilot -vehicle model by integrating vehicle dynamics, human perception, decision making and action. It will be analyzed using reliability analysis techniques in HRP -47065 REV B 598 MATLAB/Simulink to quantify system performance. 2. Conduct experiments in the Draper Laboratory fixed-base lunar landing cockpit simulator to validate critical parameters within the integrated pilot -vehicle model and determine decrements in flight control performance and pilot workload during nominal and off-nominal scenarios. 3. Extend the dynamic model to include the effect of spatial orientation on system performance and conduct experiments on the NASA Ames Research Centers Vertical Motion Simulator to investigate the effects of motion cues on pilot perception, decision making and control during instrument failures or loss of visual references during terminal descent through touchdown. This project will produce an integrated human-system model that includes perception, decision making and action as an early-stage model -based simulation design tool to identify the appropriate human - automation task allocation and information requirements to enable safe and successful lunar landing. The end result of the project will be a design tool that can be used to identify the appropriate task allocation between the human and automated control, as well as the information displays that are required for safe and successful lunar landings.

Gap description - TBD Task: Space Human Factors and Habitability MIDAS-FAST: Development and Validation of a Tool to Support Function Allocation Short Title : MIDAS Fast Responsible Organization: SHFH Supporting Organization : SHFE Funding Source : NRA Other gaps supported by this task: list gap number or N/A This proposal describes a plan to develop and validate a computer -based tool to allow researchers to evaluate various function allocation strategies in space missions. The tool will leverage the Man-Machine Integration Design and Analysis System (MIDAS, developed for NASA Ames), and provide the MIDAS -FAST (Function Allocation Simulation Tool). In this project, the team will: 1. develop a research -based module of human-a utomation interaction. 2. develop human performance models of scenarios of interest. These models will be based on task analyses performed in cooperation with subject matter experts (SMEs). 3. perform various validation studies throughout this project. The tea m will validate the task analyses by talk -through sessions with SMEs. 4. validate human performance model and human-automation interaction module predictions, validated in empirical, human-in -the-loop studies. 5. refine the models using the results of the vali dations. One particular focus of the project is on developing a prototype tool that is both usable and useful for researchers, allowing them to easily modify scenarios and evaluate different potential automation HRP -47065 REV B 599 conditions. This tool will provide for data entry screens that guide the user through the process of building a scenario. It will allow the researchers to specify numerous relevant factors, e.g., operators, tasks, environmental conditions, and function allocation strategy. It will offer a visualization capability that provides a virtual video of the scenario, showing operators interacting with equipment and each other. The output of the model run will include, in addition to the video file, parameters of interest such as situation awareness, workload, time to initiate tasks, time to complete tasks, and task accuracy. The purpose of this tool is to enable researchers to evaluate novel human -automation systems early in the design process to conduct systematic task/needs analyses. Deliverables: Techno logy or Tool_ Tools/Simulations Computer -based tool, Man -machine Integration Design and Analysis System - Function Allocation Simulation Tool (MIDAS -FAST) to assist mission planners in selecting function allocation strategies.

This DRP task will develop guidelines and tools for automation system designer to determine the appropriate work allocation to ensure efficient and safe operations and procedures. Our approach entails the development of appropriate resource metrics for operational tasks and procedures. Next, these metrics will be empirically validated against specific operational tasks.

HRP -47065 REV B 600 Gap: SHFE 1.1.2.2.1: How can we develop standard measurement techniques and metrics for evaluating the quality of user interfaces with specific a ttention to the usability of an interface? Gap description TBD Task: Usability Evaluation Short Title : Usability Responsible Organization: SHFE Supporting Organization: SHFE Funding Source : Directed Other gaps supported by this task: These tasks also address the Risk of Error Due to Inadequate Information Usability refers to the quality of an interface or hardware. It can be represented by five quality components: learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors, and satisfaction (Nielsen, 2003). Learnab ility refers to the ease of accomplishing basic tasks when users encounter the design for the first time. Efficiency is the time needed to accomplish a task after users are already familiar with the design. Memorability can be measured by the change in performance following a period of not using the interface. Errors can be counted during task execution and rated based on severity. User satisfaction is a metric indicating how pleasant the design is to use. Some of these can be represented by objective measu res, while others are subjective. However, they provide a good picture of the overall usability of a system. Furthermore, they can provide evidence for any return on investment that may result from redesigns of a system, thus making usability and human fac tors quantifiable. The area of manned spaceflight requires usability metrics and methodologies that are different than those required by industry. First, the software and hardware used in space vehicles are unique. Second, the user group of software and ha rdware is also very different: highly educated, motivated, and trained. Third, the efficiency and effectiveness of software and hardware has to be very high to meet the very low risk requirements for space vehicles. For these reasons, new methods and metrics need to be developed and existing methods and metrics need to be tailored. This proposal addresses the need for research in the area of metrics and methodologies used in hardware and software usability testing in order to define quantifiable and verifiable requirements for space vehicles. A usability test is a human -in-the-loop evaluation where a participant works through a realistic set of representative tasks using the hardware/software under investigation. The purpose of this research is to define metrics and methodologies for measuring and verifying usability in the aerospace domain, with FY10 focus on legibility, consistency, and maneuverability, and usability metrics. Usability metrics must be predictive of the level of success with the interfaces, must be easy to obtain and/or calculate, and must meet the intent of current Human -Systems Integration Requirements (NASA, 2008). Methodologies must work within the constraints of the aerospace domain, be cost and time-efficient, and applicable without extensive specialized training. The key driver for this Directed Research Proposal is the desire to promote and facilitate the development of usable space vehicles and habitats. In past programs, usability has often been an afterthought - with human factors activities coming far too late in the development lifecycle to make a difference. The goal of this DRP is to provide research -based methodologies and metrics to impact development of space vehicles and refine associated requirements Once new methodologies and metrics are developed, they will be field tested in real -world design efforts, iterated based on results, and finally described in reports and guidelines manuals, along with their application to requirements. FY10 studies will address: Aim A. Develop legibility verification methodology for hardware labels Method and Procedure : A literature review will be conducted on common practices for the measurement of legibility of hardware labels. Following the literature review, a pilot study will be conducted using the candidate method(s) on representative labels for hardware (for example, cable wire labels or control panel labels). The purpose of the testing is to decide whether the candidate methods are easy and efficient to be used as a verification method on space vehicle hardware. The testing will consist of applying the proposed verification methodology or methodologies on HRP -47065 REV B 601 realistic hardware. Aim B . Develop consistency scale for a case study Method and Procedure: The case study will use space vehicle displays that meet a pre-determined set of criteria. A general and detailed approach will be applied to the rating of consistency of space vehicle displays. Based on a thorough inspection of candidate space vehicle displays, a list of interface elements and attributes of elements that can be checked and rated for consistency will be collected. After collecting these elements and attributes, a general and detailed rating scale specific to the displays will be developed that are appropriate for the display. Aim C. Field testing with consistency scale Method and Procedure : A set of space vehicle software displays will be identified for the evaluation of the consistency scale. The space vehicle displays will be rated using both the high level and the detailed Syste m Consistency Scale to see advantages and disadvantages of both, and also to estimate time required for their application. Feedback from the raters will help revise the scales after the evaluations. To evaluate the inter -rater reliability of the scale, the ratings provided by the raters will be compared for level of agreement. Any disagreement will be inspected for relevance and severity to see what items on the scale may not be reliable. Aim D . Field testing with legibility methodology Method and Proce dure: Legibility testing will be performed with a reasonable number of possible lighting conditions and viewing angles. Performance measures will be collected for all or the most relevant combinations of factors. The identified displays will be evaluated for legibility with 10 non-crew participants using the methodology proposed in FY09 for software legibility. The displays will be presented for 1 second with the element to be read highlighted. The elements will be selected to be representative of the displays: words, acronyms, numbers, and symbols. At least 10 types of each of these elements will be used and they will be called out at least 10 times during the study to obtain sufficient data for analysis. Subjects' task will be to identify information abo ut the cued elements. Aim E . Evaluation of factors affecting maneuverability Method and Procedure: An evaluation will be conducted to evaluate factors affecting maneuverability.

Based on the scale developed in FY09 and FY10, work with a software developer to develop the software version that allows easy data entry and calculates consistency indices. We will develop the user interface of the software and provide guidelines for the interaction design. Study C. Integrated usability evaluatio n Method and Procedure: Development of acceptance criteria for integrated usability evaluation metrics based on results from a human in the loop pilot study and supporting literature review. Study D. Maneuverability Assessment Scale Method and Procedure : The MAS will be used for two types of tasks, one that is estimated to have maneuverability and another type that is estimated to have poor maneuverability. The MAS for both tasks and reliability and validity measures will be calculated based on the HRP -47065 REV B 602 result s. The subjective ratings on the maneuverability scale will be compared to objective measures of maneuverability, such as shoulder flexion, arm swing forward/backward, and shoulder abduction (Schmidt, 2001) . Research results will provide requirements and standard usability techniques and metrics to evaluate user interface quality.

Gap Description TBD Task: Workloa d Tools and Guidelines Short Title : Workload Responsible Organization: SHFH Supporting Organization: SHFE Funding Source : Directed, Collaboration with HRP BHP research shows that the relationship between workload and performance is a nuanced one. Simple approaches that attempt to maintain overall workload at an intermediate value are unlikely to achieve the desired results. The successful managemen t or evaluation of workload must include a consideration of the nature of individual tasks that operators must perform, the combinations of tasks that are performed during a work period, priorities among tasks, and individual differences among operators. This task will look at the relationship between workload and performance with the goal of producing more effective methods for evaluating proposed designs and operating procedures for space HRP -47065 REV B 603 applications. This directed research project (DRP) is an iterative, multi-phased 2- year research effort that will culminate in four deliverables to address the needs of spaceflight application designers to unobtrusively measure workload, and to create appropriate levels of human -system workload through the allocation of work between human spaceflight crew and automated systems. The ultimate goal of the FY10 -11 DRP on Workload Measurement and Management is to develop a tool to assist in workload management across an entire integrated system. This will be accomplished by conducting five primary tasks: 1. Identifying Crewmembers' operational environment and workload considerations; 2. Identifying the commonalities between workload measured at the individual level and workload from the system level; 3. Hosting a scales and measurem ent workshop; 4. Conducting a Usability evaluation of the updated Primer's protocol section 5. Developing a meaningful measure of workload as applied to system performance and evaluation. These five tasks will result in identifying system related workload var iables and in developing a candidate workload algorithm for measuring system workload. Deliverables: Standards _ Update A review of all workload measurement techniques, simple task analysis techniques, and operator performance metrics. A simple-to -use guide offering practical guidance in using these techniques when evaluating designs and procedures for using automation systems. Preliminary development of an empirical evaluation of the guide/techniques that are produced. Ground validation and analysis of workload guide and techniques. Assessment of new workload allocation technology and design capabilities for application to Habitat. Primer and guidelines will support further tool development for the PC -BH campaign.

Task: Formal Meta -Analysis of Workload Measures as Predictors of Performance Short Title : Workload Meta -Analysis Responsible Organization: SHFH Supporting Organization: SHFE Funding EPSP Gap EVA9, EPSP Gap EVA8, BHP Sleep7 While there is widespread belief that it is critical to maintain nominal workload throughout missions , there has yet to be a broad, systematic analysis of the relationship between workload measures (subjective and objective) and task performance, especially among highly trained, highly motivated populations. This NRA will solicit proposals for formal meta-analyses of workload measures' ability to model and predict human task performance on tasks analogous to those performed by operators during space missions.

Gap description TBD Task: Automation Trust and Complacency Short Title : Automation Trust Responsible Organization: SHFH Supporting Organization: SHFE Funding Source: by this task: BHP Gap Team6 In order to field successful automation systems, it is crucial to ensure that the human operators maintain an appropriate level of trust in the automation technology. Thus, the operators should not overestimate the automation's capability (leading to a condition of automation complacency), nor should they constantly override the automation authority based on an underestimation of the system's capability or a miscomprehension of the automation's algorithms and functions. These RFPs will solicit research on critical gaps identified in human -automation integration to meet NASA- specific requirements and reflect operator behavior in space environments. Emphasis will be on ensuring the appropriate level of trust in automation systems, and avoiding automation complacency. The first RFP will be iss ued in FY11; the second solicitation will be made in FY15.

Gap description TBD Task: Information Visualization and Controls for HRI Short Title : Info Vis for HRI Responsible Organization: SHFH Supporting Organization: SHFE Funding Source : RFP Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Synthetic vision is a technology that using 3D imaging to provide operators with a clear and intuitive means of understanding their environment. Through the use of appropriate advanced human-robot interfaces such as displays, controls, and imagery with a synthetic overlay, operators can have increased situational awareness (SA) of terrain and obstacles using a GPS and inertial reference system. The goal is to evaluate displays, controls, and prototype synthetic vision (SV) display concepts that would apply to numerous NASA domains such as human-robot interfaces, space vehicles, and EVA. In addition to increasing SA, such a system can enhance communication, procedural reference, allocation of functions, decision support, information architecture, and automation decisions. Data collected during evaluations will include : 1. human and robot performance (task time, workload, errors), 2. display and control usability scores (usability of alternative designs and layouts), 3. environmental effects on performance (terrestrial and extraterrestrial). The data will establish verifiable results that would aid in human -robot interface requirement development, control and display design, and usability. Research results will assist in requirements development necessary to define the human -robot interface.

Any inadequacies in the design of the environment or architecture can restrict or prevent the user from surviving in such extreme conditions and may impact safety and performance. Factors that affect the habitability must be assessed and properly addressed to ensure all potential hazards are mitigated or monitored. If the workspace, equipment and tools are not designed to be usable by the full range of crewmembers, and are not properly laid out, the likelihood of errors or crew inability to complete a task in a timely manner increases. Inconsistent design among subsystems and vehicles leads to negative transfer of training and increased likelihood of errors. Operati onal Relevance One of the most critical components for human presence in space has been ensuring that there are human systems standards in place that will provide for crew health as well as standards for habitability, environmental, and human factors. The Space Flight Human System Standards - SFHSS - (and the companion Human Integration Design Handbook - HIDH) require that each human spaceflight program derive program -specific, verifiable requirements to comply with the standards, and require that each human spaceflight program establish a human factors process involving health and human factors experts. This is to ensure that there will be identification of any standards in the SFHSS that are not applicable (or altered) and the rationale for non-applicability; that all program level h ealth and human factors requirements are based on the HIDH, cited empirical evidence, or known best practices; and that end - items are in compliance with SFHSS, and agency and program level requirements and specifications. The activities cited reflect the need to work toward the mitigation of identified SHFE risks by continuing to inform the standards, by engagement in the development of the requirements that will implement the standards based upon the resulting products, as well as providing content to the HIDH that will serve as the implementation guide. In addition, products resulting from these activities may provide valuable information to spaceflight programs that can inform the requests for trade studies. To ensure operational relevance of the deliverables from the tasks, all tasks leaders will identify stakeholders who will work with them in framing the questions and approach. The stakeholders will participate by identifying specific issues requiring research or technology development, by reviewing progress, and by suggesting operational evaluations. Depending on the specific tasks, stakeholders may include engineers or operations personnel. Strategy for Mitigation The approach to mitigating this risk is to develop an understanding of the factors that contribute to this risk, identify gaps in our knowledge about these factors, and prioritize these gaps based on various criteria systematically applied. Then the highest priority gaps are addressed through directed or solicited research depending on the time frame and the complexity and specificity of the gap. Where there is a disconnect between critical gaps requiring addressing and a lack of funding, efforts are made to re-examine the programmatic priorities to ensure those of highest concern are being investigated. HRP -47065 REV B 614 The risk associated with reduced safety and efficiency due to inadequately designed vehicles, environments, tools or equipment focuses on the overall environment that the crew will live and work in. The focus can surround the developme nt of hardware and interfaces, and how those interfaces will facilitate human performance and efficiency. Displays, controls, and procedures need to be appropriately designed and developed to allow for safe and efficient execution of tasks. Specific studies investigate the environment surrounding the crew, namely the acoustic environment, which can impact both health and performance. Other studies focus upon the vibration, acceleration and microgravity environment, again all having potential to impact hu man health and performance. The approach to mitigating this risk is to develop a thorough understanding of the operational concepts, and determine methods, metrics and verification strategies to ensure that the hardware and environment are designed for human safety and productivity. The strategy for mitigating this risk is closely connected to the strategy for addressing the Risk of Errors Due to Poor Task Design. The work captured under this risk contributes to understanding the capabilities and limits o f human performance, which is essential to appropriate task design. When a task is designed, it is critical to determine if it can be accomplished by a single person or requires additional personnel, or assistance from robots or automation. When the spacecraft and equipment are designed, both the requirements of the task and the capabilities and limits of the crew have to be considered. The specific selection choices of the highest priority gaps and tasks are based primarily on gap analyses. The SHFE pro ject updates its gap analyses on an annual basis. This is necessary as research results and continual information drawn from crew debriefings has the potential of discovering additional gaps in knowledge. These updates assist in the preparation for the annual Science Review Panel. The original analysis carried out in 2006 was published as NASA/TP-2007- 213739 (\"Space Human Factors Engineering Gap Analysis Project Final Report,\" C. Hudy and B. Woolford, 2007). An update was completed in spring 2007. The gaps are identified through reviews of the literature, of crew debrief summaries, and through interviews with more than a hundred users of human factors results, representing Engineering, Mission Operations, Flight Medicine, Training, the Crew Office, and others. We place particular emphasis on interviewing representatives from Constellation Program Office, the Human - System Integration Group, the Orion Project Office, the Cockpit Display Working Group, and other programmatic users of our products. The 'sm all' gaps or specific concerns identified from these sources are aggregated into more appropriate levels for which a specific task can be designed. For example, numerous users report gaps in design for workload: lack of consistency of definition; lack of easy to use methods to assess workload; lack of a way to verify that a requirement for workload has been met. These various individual -level concerns are captured in a gap, \"There is no standardized non -intrusive measure of workload.\" As part of the integrated Performance Change - Behavioral Health, SHFE anticipates funding two tasks related to the acquisition and analysis of task performance data onboard the ISS. The goal of these tasks is to provide robust, in situ space operations data for SHFE researchers. One of the tasks will be a directed, in-house effort; its focus will be on the integration of data acquisition tools and the secure capture, storage, and redaction of performance data; this task has an anticipated start date of FY14. The second task will be a competed effort to develop robust analysis tools to develop and verify predictive models of performance; this task is also slated for an FY14 start. After all concerns are mapped to gaps, the gaps are prioritized according to a number of criteria. Key criteria are importance to Constellation Program and need date. When we identify 'TBRs' or 'TBDs' in the Human Systems Integration Requirements, for example, these are assigned a very high priority. Ratings are solicited from management representatives of the offices from which gaps were identified. After prioritization, the gaps that can be addressed within the budget are initiated through directed research or solicited through research announcements. Directed research is chosen for time critical results. Solicitations are used for gaps that are longer term and that can benefit from wider participation. HRP -47065 REV B 615 Gaps Gap: SHFE 2.3.a (SBIR): How can crews easily document human factors related issues that occur on orbit? Gap Description: TBD Task: Semantic Language and Tools for Reporting Human Factors Incidents Short Title: Reporting Incidents Responsible Organization: SHFH Supporting Organization: SHFE Funding Source: SBIR Other gaps supported by this task: What tools can be used to evaluate habitability concepts for on- orbit and planetary missions? Space human factors data currently come from crew debriefs. Such debriefs rely on retrospective recall, which could suffer delays of up to six months. Opportunities to discuss human factors iss ues in detail during these debriefs are limited. In particular, the Space Human Factors Engineering Project is interested in obtaining timely and context-specific human factors incident data. In general, the tool will be used to help detect areas where human factors can contribute to mission success, assess the effects of operational and hardware changes, and complement existing human factors data sources for operations. Specifically, the tool will be developed to provide: 1. The crew easy access to the tool at any time to eliminate the need for the crew to recall information retrospectively. 2. An easy -to-use data gathering protocol with the following functionalities: Allow data to be entered either as text, audio, and/or video inputs, 3. The ability for the tool to detect a system anomaly automatically and immediately record system status. At a minimum, however, the tool should provide an easily accessible event marker for the crew to mark the context and take a snapshot of the system and operator system stat us. 4. A user -friendly automated data search engine for extracting meaningful incident information from the raw data. Examples of desirable search schemes include natural language, spatial, temporal searches, etc. This research will provide the framework fo r an on -orbit tool with features not found in a reporting tool to date. Deliverables: Technology or Tool_ Tools/Simulations Phase 1 Report will include results of the evaluation/research/ or development of automated data mining technologies, definition of optimal data gathering protocol(s), and recommendations for optimal hardware/software design. Development of hardware and software algorithms highly desirable.

Required Delivery Milestone: FY11 Preliminary database tool FY13 Final tool delivery Required Platforms: Ground: Laboratory Test bed Gap: SHFE 2.1.8.1: How can we determine the effects of combined vibration and acceleration on task performance? Gap Description: TBD HRP -47065 REV B 616 Task: SDBI 1904 - Human Factors Assessment of Vibration Effects on Visual Performance During Launch Short Title : Visual Perf SDBI Responsible Organization: SHFH Supporting Organization: SHFE Funding Source : Directed Other gaps supported by this task: N/A Unmitigated Ares first stage thrust oscillation produces unacceptably high vibrations to the crew in the Orion command module. The health effects are well documented and requirements in CxP 70024, Human System Integration Requirements (HSIR) (Requirement HS3105), defines the ISO -weighted RMS values for allowable exposure. Vibration also affects crew performance, and impacts reading, reaction time, and fine motor control. Specific vibration performance requirements are not provided in HSIR. Performance under vibration also depends on crew interfaces, tasks, and other induced environments. This activity intends the following: 1. During launch, crewmembers are asked to scan each of the four displays during six predefined launch phases. 2. The crewmember is to choose the smallest usable size. 3. Each crewmember has a response card, on which they mark the minimum readable font size during each phase of interest on ascent. Materials/Methods: Participants : An informed consent briefing is conducted with both crews approximately six months prior to launch. In addition, a short training session is completed with the crew at approximately one month prior to launch. Two STS- 119 and three STS -128 crewmembers par ticipated. All participants are briefed and fully trained on the procedures for the study prior to flight. Materials: Placards containing printed displays modeled after Orion display concepts are placed on the lockers in front of the middeck crewmembers. Each placard contains four quadrants, with a display in each of the four quadrants. Each display quadrant contains a different font size from a set of proposed Orion font sizes (corrected to approximate a viewing distance of 20\" from the eye to the center of the display). Because each seat is a different distance from the lockers, font sizes are increased or decreased proportionately, based on visual angle of the display fonts, so that each crewmember perceives the same effective font size. In addition, grap hical information (e.g., flow diagrams, etc.) is sized proportionately with the font sizes. The placards (approximately 10.25\" X 15.75\" in size) are printed on heavy Shuttle - approved paper and attached with Velcro to the storage lockers. The placards have a non-glossy, matte finish similar to a flat panel display. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of vibration during launch on participants' ability to read and comprehend text and graphics of different sizes on a prototype spacecraft displa y. In addition, ratings are gathered on various display characteristics, such as color, font case, and numbers. This research will provide data on the effects of vibration on performance during launch of a particular spacecraft (namely the Shuttle). Other launch vehicles will have their particular vibration profiles and correlations, if any, between those vehicles and the Shuttle will need to be determined.

Gap description TBD Required Platforms: Ground: Laboratory Test beds Flight: Shuttle (SDBI 1904) - flight already complete Task: Spinal Elongation and its Effects on Seated Heights in a Microgravity Environment Short Title : Spinal Elongation Responsible Organization: SHFH Supporting Organization: SHFE Funding Source : Directed Other gaps supported by this task: N/A NASA can provide the designers with accurate requirements for suit designs and subsequently better requirements for the design of spacecraft that must accommodate suited crew. By providing information on the physiological response of the human body to micro-gravity, and any changes in the dimensioning of the body, suit designers can have a more appropriate expectation of what to accommodate and the impacts of the changes as applicable to the designs of spacesuits. The primary objective of this project is to provide information pertaining to changes in seated height due to spinal elongation in a microgravity environment. . Spinal elongation has been observed to occur in crewmembers during space flight; however, it has only previously been recorded in the standing position with a limited number of subj ects. Seated height data in microgravity is considered necessary to identify correctly the seated height projections of the crew in the Orion configuration. Correct projections of seated height should lead to a) proper positioning of the seats within the vehicle; b) maintaining adequate clearance for seat stroke in high acceleration impacts; c) providing proper fit in seats; d) proper placement of seats with respect to each other; and e) proper orientation to displays and controls. Additionally, data concerning the effects of spinal elongation on seated height would aid in the design of suit components as well as requirements for habitations and other vehicles. The proposed experiment aims to collect seated height data for subjects exposed to microgravity environments, provide information relating to seated height rate of change over time, and feed new information regarding the elongation of the spine forward into the design of Constellation and future Program systems. Historical data indicates that spinal elongation occurs when crewmembers are subjected to microgravity. In as little as two days, the typical crewmember will exhibit increases in stature of up to 3 percent. However, to date data has been collected only for crewmembers in standing postures, and a limited pool of subjects was available. Due to the criticality of seated height in the design of the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), a better understanding of the effects of microgravity on seated height is necessary. Small changes in seated height that may not have impacted crew accommodation in previous programs will have significant effects on crew accommodation due to the layout of seats in the CEV. Changes in seated height will critically impact the CEV design due to the seat layout, if there is not enough clearance for spinal growth between seats then there is a chance that the crewmember in the bottom seat will not be able to correctly and safely fit into his/her seat. If there not enough clearance allowed for spinal growth, the crewmember in the bottom seat may impact the seat above them during vehicle stroke which could lead HRP -47065 REV B 618 to injury of the crewmember. The amount of clearance needed between the seats will also affect crew complements and crew accommodation; depending on the size of the person in seats 1 and 2 depends on the size of the person that will be able to fit in seats below. This will lead to restrictions as to who can sit where within the CEV and the determination of mission assignment of crews based on their anthropometry which does not occur for Shuttle crew assignments. The proposed study will directly measure changes in seated height for crewmembers in the Shuttle cockpit. An anthropometer will be used to record measurements to the top of the head of a seated subject, and an orthogonal photograph will be taken in order to measure seated height based on scaling references of known sizes as well as verify the posture and positioning remained consistent throughout the study. This purpose of this activity is to accomplish the followi ng: 1. To collect spinal elongation induced seated height data for subjects exposed to microgravity environments. 2. To provide information relating to the seated height rate of change over time for astronauts subjected to microgravity. 3. To feed new information concerning seated height forward into the design of Constellation systems The benefits of documenting the changes in seated height due to microgravity will: 1. Permit proper positioning of seats within the vehicle 2. Enable maintenance of adequate clearance for seat stroke in high acceleration impacts 3. Allow proper fit in seats 4. Ensure proper placement of seats with respect to each other 5. Facilitate proper orientation to displays and controls 6. Provide information to designers concerning the accommodation of the full population range as specified in Human Systems Integration Requirements (CxP 70024) Changes in seated height due to spinal growth will be recorded during flights based on measurements with an anthropometer as well as the scaling of objects of known sizes in photographs of seated crewmembers. These methodologies, which have been tested in the laboratory and Shuttle cockpit trainer, were selected as the most accurate means available during flight. Seated height measurements will be collected during the three stages of a mission, pre-, in -, and post - flight. Pre -and post - flight measurements will be collected at the Shuttle Trainers at Johnson Space Center. Pre-flight measurements will be collected anytime after informed consent has been given, between launch -180 days and launch, and post -flight measurements will be collected at approximately return +20 days. In - flight measurements will be taken at pre-defined intervals during flight for each crewmember. A minimum of one session per crewmember is required, but three sessions are proposed per crewmember. The process will involve manual measurements as well as setting up a camera mount one time according to instructions, and then leaving the mount in place throughout flight. For each set of measurements, the crewm ember will restrain him/herself into the commander seat while another crewmember assists by measuring the distance from the top of the seat to the top of the subject's head and taking a photograph using pre -defined camera settings. Data gained from this study will provide better information to CEV and future space vehicle designers. Accurate measurements of crew seated height will be valuable for vehicle and habitation designers for future programs as well. Deliverables: Requirements_ Vehicle/Suit Design Spinal elongation induced seated height data for subjects exposed to microgravity environments.

Bench testing of isolated systems alone is not sufficient as the installation effects are often not known . Acoustic modeling will be used to determine installation effects, reverberation (room geometry) effects, and will be used to identify propagation paths and possible noise controls, as well as develop an understanding of the resulting acoustic levels in the composite environment. Finally, acoustic modeling will be used to assist with the development and implementation of spaceflight acoustic materials and to predict their effectiveness including sound containment, absorption and vibration isolation.

Through this project, acoustic modeling capability is being developed for application to new spaceflight vehicles to ensure compliance with acoustic requirements. The objective of this project will be to develop an acoustic modeling capability, based on off -the-shelf software. This modeling capability will be used as a tool for oversight during design and development of future crewed vehicles to ensure compliance with acoustic requirements and thus provide a safe and habitable acoustic environment for the crews. During FY'07, the project's first year, this project determined the acoustic modeling requirements for Constellation vehicles, an d chose an off -the-shelf software package that is well -suited for the modeling task. Also, in FY'07, a simple -geometry acoustic model was developed and validated using a physical mockup and acoustic measurements. Tools for modeling the effects of absorpt ive wall treatments and the resulting reverberation environment were developed as part of this work. Limitations of the modeling technique were also investigated and documented. During FY'08, the project built an acoustic model with the Orion CM interior shape, and made noise predictions based on input noise sources. A corresponding physical mockup was also built with an approximated Orion CM interior shape. Measurements were made inside this mockup and comparisons were made with the model and showed excellent agreement. Also in FY'08, an acoustic model of the actual Orion vehicle was developed, based on CM606 Revision C. This Orion model was used to predict sound pressure level and sound power level allocations to check against the allocations develope d for Orion. During FY'09, this project incrementally increased the fidelity of the mockup model by including a simple ventilation system. A ventilation system was also added to the physical mockup including two different types of fans. The airborne noise contribution of the fans was measured using a sound intensity technique, since the sound power levels were not known beforehand. Comparisons of the modeling result with the measurements in the mockup showed compliance of predicted with measured values. Also in FY'09, a mockup of the Environmental Control and Life Support ECLS closeout panel was designed and fabricated for installation into the mockup to increase the fidelity of the modeling technique with regard to acoustic insertion loss. The objectiv es for FY'10 and beyond will build upon the previous work and will include incrementally increasing the fidelity of the mockup with the addition of secondary structure and stowage mockups. The resulting reverberation and absorption contributions will be predicted and validated. Subsequent fidelity increases will then include modeling of vibration sources including structural propagation paths. The above modeling development and techniques will be applied to Orion, Altair and other vehicles to assist wi th oversight of design and development, analyze requirement allocations, predict the noise levels in the vehicles, and locate/propose solutions for potential noise issues. FY11 is the final year of this effort and will complete any updates to the acoustic model, develop a comprehensive final report and any accompanying documentation necessary for the utilization of the model. The acoustic modeling effort (which utilizes a commercial acoustic model) is applicable to any spaceflight vehicles as the ability to model acoustic noise sources and their impacts is a necessity for occupancy protection and the information obtained as part of this project will feed the NASA Standard 3001, HIDH, and Commercial HSIR as well as future acoustic research efforts. Aim A. Determine, mockup, and model the effects on the Orion CM noise environment of ECLS Wall closeout panel and stowage effects on airborne noise. ECLS wall studies will be extended to include evaluation of the gap around the wall (between the wall and the pre ssure shell), and will also assess effects of including acoustic absorption on the ECLS Wall. Understand the relationship between mockup and model. Increase model fidelity.

Understand the relationship between mockup (real fan vibration sources/geometry) and model. Increase model fidelity. Details of operations: Model and build physical mockup of portion of Orion CM secondary structure and evaluate the structural vibration paths and acoustic radiation in crew compartment. Accelerometers and shaker will be used along with microphones to determine appropriate transfer functions. For example, a representative structure will be built and a vibrating load will be applied using the shaker. The resulting vibrations will be measured using accelerometers, and the radiated acoustic noise will be measured using microphones. An analogue of this system will also be modeled in the VA1 acoustic model so t he structure-borne noise effects in the model can be validated using the mockup. An acceptable validation will result if agreement between model and experiment is plus or minus 3 dB (or less) for the applicable frequency range. 1. Orion CM Mockup Model 2.

Acoustic model can be used to assist with the development and implementation of spaceflight acoustic materials and to predict their effectiveness including sou nd containment, absorption and vibration isolation.

With the largest habitable facility in low-Earth orbit already 12 years old, and future locations for human exploration being decided, the International Space Station (ISS) needs to provide lessons as the designs of the future are d eveloped. Typically when terrestrial buildings are constructed here on Earth, at some point it is wise to evaluate those buildings to see if the needs of the occupants have been met. Insight from those evaluations can inform future design decisions with the goal of creating better buildings. Similar evaluations of ISS need to be conducted, and tools and methods applicable to habitable environments off -Earth are needed.

The tools to evaluate the existing habitable environment are one portion of the suite of tools needed. The other tools or methods required are those that can evaluate emerging designs as they are developed, looking at not only the piece -parts, but also how those piece-parts are integrated into the overall environment and configuration. Can a tool or method be developed, usable by all involved in the design process that can effectively assess design concepts against the three criteria listed above? And can this suite of tools be extended to look at an entire integrated set of \"assets\" (spacecraft, habitat, laboratories, and/or vehicles) which is applicable to any gravity field?

This risk may be influenced by other space flight factors including micrograv ity and environmental contaminants. A Mars mission will not be feasible unless improved physical and/or biological countermeasures are developed or transit time/mission duration is significantly decreased. Risk Context Near -term goals for cancer research focus on reducing the uncertainties in risk projections through the development of tissue specific models of cancer risks, understanding the underlying mechanisms of these models, and appropriate data collection at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL ). In the long- term, extensive validation of these models with mixed radiation fields is envisioned and research on biological countermeasures and biomarkers will be pursued if needed. Research on improving cancer projections has two major emphases: 1) v alidating the application of the National Council on Radiation Protection (NCRP) model and 2) reducing the uncertainties in the coefficients that enter into the cancer projection model. Validation of the NCRP model relies on studies at the NSRL observing qualitative differences in biological damage between HZE nuclei and gamma rays and the establishment of how these differences relate to cancer risk. There are distinct mechanisms of cancer induction across and within major tissue sites, and uncertainty re duction requires tissue specific risk estimates. NRA and NASA Specialized Center of Research (NSCOR) selections focus on these major sites: lung, breast, colon, stomach, esophagus, the blood system (leukemias), liver, bladder, skin, and brain. There are differences in radiation sensitivity based on genetic and epigenetic factors and research in these areas aids the development of tissue specific cancer models. The approach to uncertainty reduction is based on evaluations of the assumptions in the current model for projecting cancer incidence and mortality risks for space missions. The cancer rate is the key assumption in the evaluation; representing the probability at a given age and years since exposure of observing a cancer. The life-span study of the atomic-bomb survivors is the primary source for gamma -ray data, however more recently meta-analysis of patients exposed to radiation or reactor workers for several tissues has become available and is used to check or replace the Japanese data. Other assumptions in the model are made with regard to the transfer of risk across populations, the use of average rates for the US population, the age, and age -after exposure dependence of risk on radiation quality and dose -rate, etc. Collaborative research with the Department of Energy (DoE) Low Dose Research Program is a key component of the strategy. The DoE program focus is on low Linear Energy Transfer (LET) irradiation; however, collaborative grants are selected from proposals that contain one or more Specific Aims addressing NASA interests using the NSRL. This research augments Space Radiation research with a number of grants using state -of-the art approaches including genetics, proteomics, and transgenic animal models. The DoE research is an important co mponent in reaching the goal to identify biomarkers of cancer risk. Determining the shape of the dose-response model for cancer induction is a near -term focus that is enumerated in biological terms through various cancer Gaps. In the NCRP model, the dose -response is linear and the slope coefficient is modulated by radiation shielding. Non-targeted models of cancer risk describe processes where cells traversed by HZE nuclei or protons produce cancer phenotypes in regions of tissues not limited to the trav ersed cells. Non -targeted effects are the major mechanism that has been identified that is in disagreement with the NCRP model, and leads to a sub -linear dose response. The implications of a sub -linear dose response for cancer risk are large since such a model predicts a reduced HRP -47065 REV B 637 effectiveness for radiation shielding, and on the importance of mission length. Research in this area is a major focus of studies at NSRL. For some cancer sites and exposure conditions, e.g., proton exposures, the NCRP model may be adequate, and research here is focused on reducing the uncertainties in the model through the establishment of tissue specific models of human cancers, and collection of data at NSRL for a variety of ground -based analogs for Solar Particle Event (SPE) and Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR). Systems biology models provide a framework to integrate mechanistic studies of cancer risk across multiple levels of understanding (molecular, cellular, and tissues), and are the most likely approach to replace the NCRP model. Systems biology models are being developed by the Risk Assessment Project and several NSCOR's, and in conjunction with data collection will improve the descriptions of cancer risks and to lay a framework for future biological countermeasure evaluations and biomarker identification. Operational Relevance Permissible exposure limits (PEL) for Space Radiation limit the allowable mission and career exposure to the space radiation environment based on the projected risk of developing cancer. The PEL's are set such that the confidence level of staying within the allowed risk limit is 95%. The use of a median risk estimate could greatly over -estimate or under -estimate the actual risk to crews because the uncertainties in risk projection models are significant ([95% confidence level/50% confidence level]>4). Mission, vehicle, and crew selection requirements are outcomes of the Space Radiation PELs, including requirements on vehicle design, mission duration, and age, gender, or past mission history for crew selection. Current estimates of mission duration limits that result from cancer fatality risks alone are shown in Table 1, comparing estimates made in 2001 without the benefit of the most recent research knowledge, to current estimates.

INCREASING SAFE DAYS IN SPACE WITH REDUCTION IN UNC ERTAINTIES Research to reduce uncertainties in risk projection models are expected to increase NASA's ability to select crew, extend mission duration, and reduce cost through possible reductions in shielding requirements. Improved knowledge of dose -rate and radiation effects will allow for EVA time lines to be extended in deep space and on the lunar or Mars surface. Furthermore, research approaches that narrow HRP -47065 REV B 638 uncertainties in risk models will no -doubt evolve into countermeasure discovery and validation approaches that have large benefits on crewmembers. The NASA PEL's for fatal cancer risk may be exceeded for several lunar scenarios including a large SPE, cumulative career exposure, and mission length dependent on crew age and gender. The Operational relevance of these conditions is obviously critical and could delay, reduce the length of missions, or make the costs to prevent PEL violation far too excessive. Reducing the uncertainties in risk projections through NSRL research, which are part of the radiation PELs, could possibly alleviate cancer risk projections below PELs. Possible mitigation approaches such as parasitic radiation shielding are very costly for SPE's and may prove prohibitive for GCR. The final solution may be a combination of uncertainty reducti on, shielding, mission length, and crew selection with effective biological countermeasures. Biological countermeasures to mitigate the risk or improve treatment are in early stages of development and projections of their effectiveness highly uncertain. The NASA PELs for fatal cancer risk are projected to be violated under all possible Mars scenarios at this time making the radiation cancer risk critical as the mission cannot be undertaken without further breakthrough leading to uncertainty reduction in risk projection models or to the development of biological countermeasures. Dependent on new research results, the cumulative risk from CNS and Degenerative when combined with Cancer risks will likely have major negative impacts on mission design, costs, schedule, and crew selection. Thus risk projection model development and PELs will begin with Cancer Risks, but eventually incorporate projection capabilities for Acute, CNS, and Degenerative Tissue Risks. Strategy for Mitigation SRPE plans to conduct a p hased implementation approach to reduce the uncertainty associated with space radiation effects and develop countermeasure recommendations in support of Lunar and Mars vehicle and mission planning. A breakthrough research strategy is utilized because of the large scientific challenges needed to understand and mitigate human risks to space radiation. Examples of breakthroughs that have occurred in recent years are the hallmark molecular changes in cancer stem cells in cancer research. Breakthroughs create large perturbations in research plans and schedules, and have large benefits to achieving SPRE goals. Future breakthroughs are expected, albeit not possible to predict. Biological countermeasure research will be conducted at a low level in the near -term ; such research, however, will be increased after experimental (biological) models of human risks are established and uncertainties are significantly reduced. This is due to a need to understand the biological targets for countermeasures and to ensure the ability to assess properly their potential effectiveness. Similar phased approaches are followed for biomarker research. The SRPE established a scientific approach that follows a progression of activities designed to feed the development of an integrated risk model with acceptable uncertainty for exploration missions, followed by activities targeting risk mitigation and monitoring. These activities are not necessarily implemented in serial, but emphasis is placed on 1 to 3, the successful completion of which should facilitate model development to enable mission durations required for currently planned lunar missions. Successful completions of 4 to 7 are needed to enhance model development to enable Mars missions. Items 4 to 7 are being pursued at a mini mal level in the current program. As activities essential for lunar missions are completed, greater effort will be spent in activities essential for Mars missions. The activities required to develop the cancer risk projection model are as follows: 1) Esta blish Mechanisms of Cancer and CM Action 2) Develop Tissue and Risk Specific Experimental Models 3) Understand radiation quality effects on biological damage to quantify risk HRP -47065 REV B 639 4) Understand the dependence of risk on dose -rates in space 5) Extrapolation fro m experimental data to humans to quantify risk 6) Understand individual radiation-sensitivity to quantify risk 7) Develop countermeasures, technologies, and models for Risk Mitigation and Monitoring Figure 1 graphically illustrates components of the resear ch approach. Figure 1. Flow Chart of Components in the SRPE Research A pproach Overview of Research Approach Permissible Exposure Limits for career exposure to radiation is limited to not exceed 3% risk of exposure induced death (REID) for fatal cancer. NASA assures that this risk limit is not exceeded at a 95% confidence level using a statistical assessment of the uncertainties in the risk projection calculations to limit the cumulative effective dose received by an astronaut throughout his or her career. The approximate fold uncertainty is defined as the ratio of the upper 95% Confidence Level to the point risk projection. An acceptable fold uncertainty for mission classes (ISS, lunar, Mars and others beyond LEO) thus depends on the point risk projec tion for a specific mission as well as the magnitude of risk projection model uncertainties. As the point risk projection of %REID increases, the fold uncertainty must be reduced in order to remain below the acceptable level of mortality risk (3%) for e ach class of mission. Cancer point risk projections for 40- yr females on STS, ISS, and 180 -day lunar, and Mars missions are currently estimated at about 0.01, 0.35, 0.7, and 5%, respectively. Therefore, a much lower fold uncertainty can be accepted for lunar or Mars missions than missions in LEO to assure risk acceptance levels are not exceeded. More accurate and mechanistic models of risk must be developed for these missions, as well as, providing countermeasures to lower point risk projections for Mars class missions. This constraint leads to a major goal for research approaches followed by SRPE with uncertainties less than 2-fold needed for long-term lunar stays, and less than +50% for a Mars mission. See Figure 2 for the timeline for reducing uncert ainties.

HRP -47065 REV B 642 Biological Risk Research The large number of GCR nuclei type, energies, SPE doses, and dose-rates, in combination with the multiple tissue and cancer types makes the performance of large-scale animal or 3D human cell culture studies of cancer risk at NSRL prohibitive. Therefore, a mechanistic approach is needed and has been segmented into major mechanistic research areas (Gaps Can cer 1, 2, and 7-9). These areas may find synergy in the types and range of biological models employed however will differ in the complicated hypothesis questions being addressed. Ultimately, mechanistic studies must progress to determine quantitative data sets for estimating probabilities for increase risk of carcinogenesis that in conjunction with research on Risk Assessment models will be used to extrapolate risks from experimental model to risks in astronauts on specific exploration missions. There are distinct mechanisms of cancer induction across and within major tissue sites; thus uncertainty reduction requires tissue specific risk estimates (Gap Cancer 3 -5). NRA and NSCOR selections focus on current estimates of major sites for cancer risks, which include lung, breast, colon, stomach, esophagus, the blood system (leukemias), liver, bladder, skin, and brain. There are differences in radiation sensitivity based on genetic and epigenetic factors (Gaps Cancer 5) and research in these areas aids the dev elopment of tissue specific cancer models. Hypothesis directed studies to establish the underlying mechanisms for the risks, and the possibility of synergistic effects with SPE's or other flight factors may also be considered. NRA, NSCOR, or joint DoE -NASA studies in this area will use state-of -the art animal models (including transgenic mice) and genetically engineered human cell culture models to answer a variety of questions related to the Gaps in biological mechanisms. These studies are critical in establishing the level of proof that underlies NASA risk projection models. As research understanding is improved, extended duration validation studies with a finite number of animal or 3D human cell culture models using mixed fields representing GCR and S PE will be performed at NSRL using the existing exposure cave or potentially a new cave with improved capability for extended duration GCR simulations. The cancer risk related NSCOR studies are 5-year studies and allow for long -term animal or sequential mechanistic studies with multiple components. Risk Assessment The SRPE approach to uncertainty reduction is based on studying the current model NASA uses as recommended by the NCRP for projecting cancer incidence and mortality risks for space missions. Thi s model employs the double -detriment life table for calculating the risk of radiation induced cancers against the background of cancers in the general population and competing mortality risks. The cancer rate (Hazard function) is the key quantity in the evaluation; representing the probability at a given age and years since exposure of observing a cancer. The NCRP model assumes the cancer incidence or mortality rate is scalable to human epidemiology data for gamma rays using a linear -energy transfer depen dent radiation quality factor, Q(LET), and a dose and dose -rate reduction factor (DDREF). Other assumptions in the model are made with regard to the transfer of risk across populations, the use of average rates for the US population, the age, and age -after exposure dependence of risk on radiation quality and dose -rate, etc. These models will be updated as new data from biological mechanism and data are obtained as described by Gaps- Cancer 3 -7. Systems biology models provide a framework to integrate mecha nistic studies of cancer risk across multiple levels of understanding (molecular, cellular, and tissues), and are the most likely approach to replace the NCRP model. Systems biology models are being developed by the Risk Assessment Project and several NSCOR's, and in conjunction with data collection will improve the descriptions of cancer risk and to lay a framework for future biological counter -measure evaluations and biomarker identification (Gap Cancer 14). HRP -47065 REV B 643 Shielding Physics & Dosimetry The evaluation of radiation shielding effectiveness for GCR is currently hindered by data on radiation quality effects and the shape of the dose -response curve for cancer induction. However, controlling secondary neutron components through material selections and developing computer tools for shielding evaluations is a near -term focus for spacecraft design applications as carried out by the Design Tools project under Gap Cancer 13. A goal of the Design Tools project is to provide fast and reliable tools for optimization in support of engineering shielding designs. Radiation physics improvements will be developed in support of these analysis efforts (Gap Cancer 11). SRPE will also support tasks that integrate data from lunar or Martian robotic probes to improve analysis capabilities (Gap Cancer 12) Biological Countermeasures The long-term phase of research will likely involve research on biological countermeasure (BCM) evaluation. BCM is a lower criticality in the current phase of the program for three reasons: 1) the uncertainties in cancer projections prevent the evaluation of the need for BCM. 2) An improved understanding of the mechanisms of cancer risk is needed to be able to extrapolate results from BCM studies in experimental models to astronauts on exploration m issions, and 3) identify effective surrogate markers to perform testing of potential BCMs. Research related to Gap Cancer 8 will evolve from new knowledge gained from biological mechanisms and risk assessment research. Current NRA studies with anti-oxidants and related agents may be expanded to target specific molecular pathways and tissues, which make the largest contribution to cancer risks. Cell and animal models and appropriate endpoints will be identified and combined with new systems biology tools to obtain quantitative projections of BCM effectiveness for astronauts in specific exploration missions. Gaps The following gaps are a culmination of research questions identified through the Bioastronautics Roadmap Development, National Academy of Science - Institute of Medicine Review, National Council for Radiation Protection Reviews, Recommendations and Reports, Radiation Discipline Working Group advisory panel recommendations, annual Radiation PI workshops, and the Sept '06 Discipline Review. More re cently the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Institute Of Engineering has reported on approaches to Manage Lunar radiation risks (NAS, 2008), and the NAS Institute of Medicine (IOM) has reviewed the Evidence based review of the four major risks and associated Gaps. Based on the above recommendations, a total of 14 Gaps have been re-formulated for the Risk of Radiation Carcinogenesis from Space Radiation. Due to the reliance on NRA and NSCOR research, many tasks address several Gaps, making it difficult to list each task under each gap. The SPRE has chosen to provide a table of Gaps followed by a table of current tasks identifying whether it is solicited, directed, or NSCOR (which are all solicited) and the gaps addressed by that research.

The design tools methods will specifically address the limitations associated with simplified geometry description (equivalent aluminum, three -layer transport interpolation, random orientation) and straight ahead transport. The design tools increases fidelity by incorporating common spacecraft and user specified materials in the geometry description with ray -by-ray transport to minimize t he uncertainties due to range -scaling of material thicknesses and material ordering. Ray -by ray transport also establishes the basis to calculate the forward/backward neutron generation within vehicle/lunar surface geometries. The back -scattered neutron environment will be calculated from the opposite sides of the vehicle for a crew member's specific orientation at specific tissue locations. This will increase our ability to evaluate the effectiveness of shielding systems.

Radiation and synergistic effects of radiation with other space flight factors may affect neural tissues, which in turn may lead to changes in function or behavior. Data specific to the spaceflight environment must be compiled to quantify the magnitude of this risk. If this is identified as a risk of high enough magnitude then appropriate protection strategies should be employed. Risk Context A critical question for the current phase of research is to understand whether there is a significant risk of CNS effects and establish possible threshold doses for specific CNS risks. Central Nervous System (CNS) risks from GCR are a concern due to the possibility of single HZE nuclei traversals causing tissue damage, as evidenced by the light -flash phenomenon first observed during the Apollo missions. As survival prognosis for patients irradiated for brain tumor treatment has improved, patients have show n persistent CNS changes at long times after treatment with gamma rays suggesting a possible CNS risk for a large SPE. Furthermore, animal studies of behavior and performance with HZE radiation suggest detrimental changes may occur during long-term GCR exp osures. Currently, there is no projection model for CNS risks of concern to NASA. Research at NSRL is using a variety of animal and cellular models to study the dose and radiation quality dependence of CNS risks. The extrapolation of model data to astronau ts will be the major focus of CNS research in the immediate future. The values of possible thresholds for CNS risks and knowledge on how to extrapolate possible thresholds to individual astronauts is a key milestone in the long -term research plan to allow development of a CNS -specific risk projection model. Operational Relevance The NASA PELs for CNS risk was developed based on existing animal data from heavy ion exposures. Although animal data and brain cancer irradiation evidence suggests CNS structu ral and functional impacts from radiation exposure, additional research is required to fully understand and quantify this risk. This risk has considerable uncertainty associated with it and no acceptable model for projecting CNS risk is currently availabl e. The PEL could be violated under possible scenarios, including following a large SPE or long -term GCR exposure, however, without a clear understanding of the CNS risk, it has been rated Important for both the lunar and Mars missions. Ongoing research i n this area is intended to quantify this risk to determine criticality for both extended duration missions. New research results could lead to cumulative risk from CNS and Degenerative tissue Disease which when combined with Cancer risks have major negative impacts on mission design, costs, schedule, and crew selection. Strategy For Mitigation As discussed in the Risk of Radiation Carcinogenesis from Space Radiation, SRPE plans to conduct a phased implementation approach to address the CNS risk. The same breakthrough research strategy is utilized due to the large scientific challenges needed to understand and mitigate CNS risks from space radiation. An example of a breakthrough that has occurred in recent years with regard to CNS is the discovery of neurogenesis in CNS research. Breakthroughs create large perturbations in research plans and schedules, and have large benefits to achieving SPRE goals. Future breakthroughs are expected, albeit not possible to predict. HRP -47065 REV B 662 Biological countermeasure research will be conducted at a low level in the near -term, however will be increased after experimental (biological) models of human risks are established and uncertainties are significantly reduced. The SRPE approach that follows a progression of activities designed to feed the development of an integrated risk model with acceptable uncertainty for exploration missions, followed by activities targeting risk mitigation and monitoring is also used for the CNS risk. These activities are not necessarily implemented in serial, but emphasis is placed on 1 to 3, the successful completion of which should facilitate model development to enable mission durations required for currently planned lunar missions. Successful completions of 4 to 7 are needed to enhance model development to enable Mars missions. Items 4 to 7 are being pursued at a minimal level in the current program. As activities essential for Lunar missions are completed, greater effort will be spent in activities essential for Mars missions. The activities required to develop the CNS risk projection model are as follows: 1) Establish Mechanisms of CNS and CM Action 2) Develop Tissue and Risk Specific Experimental Models 3) Understand radiation quality effects on biological damage to quantify risk 4) Understand the dependence of risk on dose -rates in space 5) Extrapolation from experimental data to humans to quantify risk 6) Understand individual radiation-sensitivity to quantify risk 7) Develop countermeasures, technologies, and models for Risk Mitigation and Monito ring Figure 1 graphically illustrates components of the research approach.

It is likely that although acute CNS risks occur only above a dose threshold (Gap CNS -1) and that the lifetime risks for CNS diseases, such as Alzheimer's, will have distinct dose dependence with the additional questions re lated to latency to disease of primary interest (Gap CNS-2). The values of possible thresholds for CNS risks and knowledge on how to extrapolate possible thresholds to individual astronauts will be a key milestone in the long -term research plan. An impor tant component of this research is to factor in the variation of CNS risk with genotype or other CNS injury (Gap CNS -3). A variety of mechanisms must be understood including the roles of neurodegeneration, inflammation, microvasculature damage, and changes to specific neuron -chemical pathways. These research areas will have overlaps in usage of NSRL, and potential animal or cellular models employed, however individual NRA or NSCOR projects will pursue distinct hypothesis driven research questions leading to distinct endpoints and biological assays. Hypothesis directed studies to establish the underlying mechanisms for the risks (Gap CNS 1 -3, 5, 6), and the possibility of synergistic effects with SPE's or other flight factors will also be considered (Gap C NS-8). The CNS risk related NSCOR study is a 5 -year study allowing for long-term animal or sequential mechanistic studies with multiple components. Risk Assessment Research approaches are establishing the biochemistry of CNS impacts by HZE nuclei. Since p rojection based on scaling to human data as done for cancer risk is not possible, a systems biology approach for individual CNS risks may be needed to form a basis for animal to human extrapolation, and will rely on understanding of biochemical changes in the CNS caused by space radiation (Gaps CNS 5, 6). Because of the large number of GCR nuclei types and energies, comprehensive studies under mixed -field SPE or GCR simulation conditions for extended time periods (hours to a few weeks) may be needed at NSR L. Extended duration studies will be useful in addressing SRPE gaps in synergistic risks from other spaceflight factors and radiation damage to the CNS. Biological Countermeasures Biological countermeasure and biomarker research for CNS risks is a lower priority in the near -term research strategy until the nature and magnitude of the CNS risk is more firmly established. Several studies on oxidative damage and anti -oxidants are supported; however, this is not a significant emphasis of SRPE's approach. Th e future need for BCM research will be driven by the levels of risk determined by current research and may transition to become a major long-term focus. It is expected that the mechanistic understanding acquired from near -term research will set the course for effective countermeasures approaches in the future as needed (Gap CNS -4). Shielding Physics The development of new biological understanding of CNS risks will determine if shielding protection for CNS is distinct from other shielding approaches to othe r radiation risks. Preliminary assessments suggest HZE nuclei with Z>10 or slow neutrons may be a higher relative concern for CNS than other risks, and may place more emphasis on shielding these components (Gap CNS -7). Gaps The following gaps are a culmination of research questions identified through the Bioastronautics Roadmap Development, National Academy of Science - Institute of Medicine Review, National Council HRP -47065 REV B 664 for Radiation Protection Reviews, Recommendations and Reports, Radiation Discipline Working Group advisory panel recommendations, annual Radiation PI workshops, and the Sept '06 Discipline Review. More recently the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Institute Of Engineering has reported on approaches to Manage Lunar radiation risks (NAS, 2008), and the NAS Institute of Medicine (IOM) has reviewed the Evidence based review of the four major risks and associated Gaps. Based on the above recommendations, a total of 8 Gaps have been formulated for the Risk of Acute or Late Central Nervous System Affects from Radiation Exposure . As with carcinogenesis, the SPRE relies heavily on NRA and NSCOR research, making it difficult to list each task under each gap. The SPRE has chosen to provide a table of Gaps followed by a table of current tasks identifyi ng whether it is solicited, directed, or NSCOR (which are all solicited) and the gaps addressed by that research. CNS - 1: Is there a significant probability that space radiation would lead to immediate or acute functional changes in the CNS during a long-term space mission and if so what are the mechanisms of change? Are there threshold doses for these effects? CNS - 2: Is there a significant probability that space radiation exposures would lead to long-term or late degenerative CNS risks if so what are the mechanisms of change? CNS - 3: How does individual susceptibility including hereditary pre -disposition (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, apoE) and prior CNS injury (concussion or other) alter significant CNS risks? Does individual susceptibility modify poss ible threshold doses for these risks in a significant way? CNS - 4: What are the most effective biomedical or dietary countermeasures to mitigate CNS risks? By what mechanisms are the countermeasures likely to work? CNS - 5: How can new knowledge and da ta from molecular, cellular, tissue and animal models of acute CNS risks or clinical human data, including altered motor and cognitive function and behavioral changes be used to estimate acute CNS risks to astronauts from GCR and SPE? CNS - 6: How can new knowledge and data from molecular, cellular, tissue and animal models of late CNS risks or clinical human date be used to estimate late CNS risks to astronauts from GCR and SPE? CNS - 7: What are the best shielding approaches to protect against CNS risks, and are shielding approaches for CNS and cancer risks synergistic? CNS - 8: Are there significant CNS risks from combined space radiation and other physiological or space flight factors (e.g., sleep deprivation, psychological, microgravity, immune -endocrine systems or other)?

The purpose of these Project is fourfold: (1) evaluate the extent to which ongoing research leads to reduction in the uncertainty of risk assessments and provide, as a metric of program progress, the number of days in space during which the radiation exposure of astronauts remains below NASA limits within a 95% confidence interval (\"safe days in space\"); (2) perform mission planning studies to predict the number of safe days for any mission; (3) assess the radiation risk to astronauts for ongoing missions in real time; and, (4) provide recommendations for research directions most likely to reduce risk or improve the accuracy of risk predictions. The Project utilizes new approaches to develop models of risk assessment based on mechanistic space radiobiology research funded by the Space Radiation Program, leading to incremental uncertainty reduction based on new experimental data. To accomplish these goals, new molecular based models of risk will be established. The molecular pathways that are the hallmarks of genomic instability and cancer, and the perturbation of these pathways by radiation will be described using systems biology approaches and Monte -Carlo simulation. Descriptive models of such pathways utilizing track structure models of biomolecular damage, and deterministic and stochastic kinetic models of dominant molecular pathways causative of BR radiation risks will be developed. These simulations will make maximum use of results from mechanistic space radiobiology, and will replace traditional hazard functions and their inherent uncertainties due to reliance on epidemiological or phenomenological approaches. Project specific aims include: \u00b7 Specific Aim A : To facilitate the integration of space radiobiology research results into improved models of BR radiation risk projections. \u00b7 Specific Aim B: To complete the cancer risk uncertainty analysis factors to be used for near - term mission planning (trade studies), and to update these as new radiobiological data sets become available. \u00b7 Specific Aim C : To develop descriptive and predictive models of modifications to biochemical pathways known likely to be causative of cancer risk. \u00b7 Specific Aim D: To integrate or develop new data and models of DNA damage, transmissible chromosomal aberration including translocation, insertions, terminal deletion inc luding telomere loss, and other aberrations related to chromosomal instability or cancer initiation, incorporating applications to the simulations in Specific Aim C. \u00b7 Specific Aim E : To perform a comprehensive assessment of available acute radiation risk projection models, and to develop simulation software of acute risk for mission design assessments. Accomplishment of these specific aims supporting closing gaps listed above and oversight of ALL gaps.

Deliverables and access to the Integrated Radiation Design Tools fills identified gaps documented in the HRP Integrated Research Plan (HRP-47065, Rev. A) to support the evaluation of effective shielding options by the engineering community: \u00b7 Cancer - 11: What are the most effective shielding approaches to mitigate cancer risks? \u00b7 Cancer - 13: What are the most effective approaches to integrate radiation shielding analysis codes with collaborative engineering design environments used by spacecraft and planetary habitat design efforts? \u00b7 Acute - 6: What are the most effective shielding approaches to mitigate acute radiation risks, how do we know, and implement? \u00b7 CNS -7: What are the best shielding approaches to protect against CNS risks, and are shielding approaches for CNS and cancer risks synergistic? The design tools methods will specifically address the limitations associated with simplified geometry description (equivalent aluminum, three -layer transport interpolation, random ori entation) and straight ahead transport. The design tools increases fidelity by incorporating common spacecraft and user specified materials in the geometry description with ray -by-ray transport to minimize the uncertainties due to range -scaling of material thicknesses and material ordering. Ray -by ray transport also establishes the basis to calculate the forward/backward neutron generation within vehicle/lunar surface geometries. The back -scattered neutron environment will be calculated from the opposit e sides of the vehicle for a crew member's specific orientation at specific tissue locations. This will increase our ability to evaluate the effectiveness of shielding systems.

Radiation and synergistic effects of radiation cause increased DNA strand and tissue degeneration, which may lead to acute or chronic disease of susceptible organ tissues. Data specific to the spaceflight environment must be compiled to quantify the magnitude of this risk to determine if additional protection is required. Risk Context Cataracts have long been a research focus of NASA. More recently, however, several epidemiological studies, including results from the atomic -bomb survivors and nuclear reactor workers, have identified a significant risk of stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD) for low LET radiation at doses comparable to those of an extended lunar mission or a Mars mission, or a short -duration lunar mission with a large SPE. An increased risk of cataracts associated with low dose space radiation from past NASA Missions has been reported and is being followed up with a cl inical study of cataract progression rates in current or retired astronauts. Several NSRL studies of cataract risks are supported to improve the understanding of how proton and HZE nuclei induce cataracts, and to identify possible countermeasure approache s. Since the risk of heart disease is a recent finding, preliminary studies in these areas are seeking to establish possible distinctions in mechanisms for this risk between protons and HZE nuclei and gamma rays. Furthermore, the SRPE will take advantage of studies supported by the European Union in this area, which is supporting large -scale mouse studies of CHD. These studies should present new insights into the nature of the low LET (gamma -ray) risk at low dose-rates is comparable to space conditions, and identify appropriate mouse strains to be used in future SR studies. Operational Relevance The NASA PELs for cataract and heart risks are based on existing human epidemiology data. Although animal and clinical astronaut data show a significant increase in cataracts following exposure and a reassessment of atomic bomb data suggests an increase in CHD from radiation exposure, additional research is required to fully understand and quantify this risk. This risk has considerable uncertainty associated with it and no acceptable model for projecting degenerative tissue risk is currently available. The PEL could be violated under possible scenarios, including following a large SPE or long- term GCR exposure, however, without a clear understanding of the risk, it has been rated Important for both the lunar and Mars missions. Ongoing research in this area is intended to quantify this risk to determine criticality for both extended duration missions. New research results could lead to cumulative risk from CNS and Degenerative Tissue Disease which when combined with Cancer risks have major negative impacts on mission design, costs, schedule, and crew selection. Strategy For Mitigation As discussed in the Risk of Radiation Carcinogenesis from Space Radiation, S RPE plans to conduct a phased implementation approach to address the degenerative tissue risk. The same breakthrough research strategy is utilized due to the large scientific challenges needed to understand and mitigate degenerative tissue risks from space radiation. Breakthroughs create large perturbations in research plans and schedules, and have large benefits to achieving SPRE goals. Future breakthroughs are expected, albeit not possible to predict. HRP -47065 REV B 673 Biological countermeasure research will be conducted at a low level in the near -term, however will be increased after experimental (biological) models of human risks are established and uncertainties are significantly reduced.

Cell or animal models of degenerative risks will be developed and applied to determine the mechanisms for degenerative risks and to determine appropriate risk assessment data for models including relative biological effectiveness and dose-rate dependencies for different space radiation ions at NSRL (Gaps Degen 1 -4). In the near -term, NRA research will support a small number of studies on heart and lens risks. A long term -focus will be to support an NSCOR in this area in 2014 and beyond. As mission duration increases, there could be degenerative risks to other tissues related to digestive diseases and pulmonary changes that become a concern. A long-term goal will be to consider such possible changes in animal validation studies made at a possible extended duration GCR facility developed at NSRL in the future. The NASA Study of Cataracts in Astronauts (NASCA) is collecting data on the incidence and progression rates of cataracts in over 230 current or retired astronauts. The possibility of synergistic risks with other flight factors must also be considered (Gap Degen -7) Risk Assessment An increased risk of cataracts associated with low dose space radiation from past NASA Missions has been reported and is being followed up with a clinical study (NASCA) of cataract progression rates in current or retired astronauts. Several NSRL studies of cataract risks are supported to improve the understanding of how proton and HZE nuclei induce cataracts, and to identify possible countermeasure approaches. The NASCA study and NSRL research will be used by the Risk Assessment Project to project cataract risks for specific space missions. Risk assessment models for cataract risk will be developed (Gap Degen 5) through biophysical models of new or existing radiobiology data. New models for other degenerative risks will be developed after studies of biological mechanisms have matured. Biologic al Countermeasures Research on BCMs (Gap Degen 6) for other degenerative risks is envisioned after studies of biological mechanisms have matured. Timelines to begin research on BCM for the Degenerative Risks are dependent on progress in Cancer and CNS res earch within the current SRPE research prioritization plans, and perhaps based on the findings of the initial biological mechanisms research phase of the research plan. Gaps The following gaps are a culmination of research questions identified through the Bioastronautics Roadmap Development, National Academy of Science - Institute of Medicine Review, National Council for Radiation Protection Reviews, Recommendations and Reports, Radiation Discipline Working Group advisory panel recommendations, annual Radiation PI workshops, and the Sept '06 Discipline Review. More recently the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Institute Of Engineering has reported on approaches to Manage Lunar radiation risks (NAS, 2008), and the NAS Institute of Medicine (IOM) has reviewed the Evidence based review of the four major risks and associated Gaps. Based on the above recommendations, a total of 7 Gaps have been formulated for the Risk of Degenerative Tissue or Other Health Effects from Radiation Exposure. As with carcinogenesis, the SPRE relies heavily on NRA research, making it difficult to list each task under each gap. The SPRE has chosen to provide a table of Gaps followed by a table of current tasks identifying whether it is solicited, or directed, and the gaps addressed by that research.

The purpose of these Project is fourfold: (1) evaluate the extent to which ongoing research leads to reduction in the uncertainty of risk assessments and provide, as a metric of program progress, the number of days in space during which the radiation exposure of astronauts remains below NASA limits within a 95% confidence interval ( \"safe days in space\" ); (2) perform mission planning studies to predict the number of safe days for any mission; (3) assess the radiation risk to astronauts for ongoing missions in real time; and, (4) provide recommendations for research directions most likely to reduce risk or improve the accuracy of risk predictions. The Project utilizes new approaches to develop models of risk assessment based on mechanistic space radiobiology research funded by the Space Radiation Program, leading to incremental uncertainty reduction based on new experimental data. To accomplish these goals, new molecular based models of risk will be established. The molecular pathways that are the hallmarks of genomic instability and cancer, and the perturbation of these pathways by radiation will be described using systems biology approaches and Monte -Carlo simulation. Descriptive models of such pathways utilizing track structure models of bio molecular damage, and deterministic and stochastic kinetic models of dominant molecular pathways causative of BR radiation risks will be developed. These simulations will make maximum use of results from mechanistic space radiobiology, and will replace traditional hazard functions and their inherent uncertainties due to reliance on epidemiological or phenomenological approaches. Project specific aims include: \u00b7 Specific Aim A: To facilitate the integration of space radiobiology research results into impr oved models of BR radiation risk projections. \u00b7 Specific Aim B: To complete the cancer risk uncertainty analysis factors to be used for near - term mission planning (trade studies), and to update these as new radiobiological data sets become available. \u00b7 Specific Aim C: To develop descriptive and predictive models of modifications to biochemical pathways known likely to be causative of cancer risk. \u00b7 Specific Aim D: To integrate or develop new data and models of DNA damage, transmissible chromosomal aberration including translocation, insertions, terminal deletion including telomere loss, and other aberrations related to chromosomal instability or cancer initiation, incorporating applications to the simulations in Specific Aim C. \u00b7 Specific Aim E: To perform a comprehensive assessment of available acute radiation risk projection models, and to develop simulation software of acute risk for mission design assessments. Accomplishment of these specific aims supporting closing gaps listed above and oversight of ALL gaps.

Risk Context Radiation and synergistic effects of radiation may place the crew at significant risk for ARS from a major solar event such that the mission or crew survival may be placed in jeopardy. Crew health and performance may be impacted by acute solar events. Beyond Low Earth Orbit, the protection of the Earth's magnetosphere is no longer available, such that increased shielding and protective mechanisms are necessary to prevent acute radiation sickness and impacts to mission success or crew survival. The primary data available at present are derived from analysis of medical patients and persons accidentally exposed to high doses of radiation. Data more specific to the spaceflight environment must be compiled to quantify the magnitude of increase of this risk and to develop appropriate protection strategies. Operational Relevance There is a variety of acute radiation syndromes of concern following a large SPE exposure. Through careful evaluation of SPE frequency and size probabilities, dose-rates, likely shielding conditions, and dose distribution at specific organs, the SRPE Risk Assessment Project has determined that the likelihood of acute risks IVA is extremely small. There are scenarios, however, during lunar, trans-lunar, or Mars EVAs where acute radiation sickness may occur. Radiation sicknesses, i.e., the prodromal risks, include the risks of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue. These effects are manifested at about 4 to 24 hours post-exposure for exposures at sub-lethal doses with a latency time inversely correlated with dose. Furthermore, albeit the possibility of acute death through the collapse of the blood forming organs (BFO) is negligible, there is a reasonable concern of a compromised immune system due to high skin doses from a SPE leading to burns, which could increase the risk to the BFO. Because the mechanisms of acute risks from SPE's will not differ substantially from X -rays and gamma-rays where experimental models have already been developed, research on acute risks is largely a data collection activity with appropriate proton energies, doses, and dose -rates to represent major SPEs. In the long-term, the SRPE will consider research on fertil ity, sterility, and hereditary risks from space radiation. Acute radiation risks are averted through radiation shielding inside most shielding habitats or lunar transfer vehicles; however , radiation exposure limits could be exceeded during deep space tra nsit, including Venus swing-by (<0.5 AU) or extensive lunar surface EVAs, making this risk important for NASA's goals. Disruptions include reducing EVA times by several hours or requiring excessive radiation shielding. EVA programs will have to be significantly reduced if risk assessment not improved and countermeasures developed. Strategy for Mitigation As discussed in the Risk of Radiation Carcinogenesis from Space Radiation, SRPE plans to conduct a phased implementation approach to address the acute radiation risk. HRP -47065 REV B 683 Biological countermeasure research will be conducted at a low level in the near -term, however will be increased after experimental (biological) models of human risks are validated. The SRPE approach that follows a progression of activities d esigned to feed the development of an integrated risk model with acceptable uncertainty for exploration missions, followed by activities targeting risk mitigation and monitoring is used for the acute risk. These activities are not necessarily implemented in serial, but since the knowledge associated with acute risk is much further along than other risks, emphasis is placed on 1 to 6, the successful completion of which should facilitate model validation to enable mission durations required for currently pla nned lunar and Mars missions. The activities required to validate the Acute Radiation Syndromes risk projection model are as follows: 1) Establish Mechanisms of radiation-induced acute radiation syndrome and CM Action 2) Understand radiation quality effects on biological damage to quantify risk 3) Understand the dependence of risk on dose -rates in space 4) Extrapolation from experimental data to humans to quantify risk 5) Understand individual radiation-sensitivity to quantify risk 6) Develop countermeasur es, technologies, and models for Risk Mitigation and Monitoring Figure 1 graphically illustrates components of the research approach. Figure 1. Flow Chart of Components in the SRPE Research A pproach Biological Risk Research Research on acute risks relat ed to EVA conditions must factor in the role of dose -rate over an EVA time course, the additional exposure IVA for a terminated EVA, and other spaceflight factors that could modify expected dose response models for acute risks. Animal and cell culture models appropriate for these acute risks will be used in the research to study protons effects at various doses, dose-rates, and proton energies including simulation of solar particle event spectra (Gap Acute 1). A research emphasis on the role of the immune system and possible synergistic effects on acute risks are needed (Gap Acute Mechanistic StudiesAnimal/Tissue Models Of Specific RisksRisk ModelingBasis for Knowledge of Modifying Factors: Quality, Dose -rate, Individual Sensitivity, Countermeasures Risk Projections, PELs, Requirements, Other Outputs, DeliverablesEpidemiology Updates, Shielding, Physics, Dosimetry Other Outside InputsComponents of Research Approach CountermeasuresHRP -47065 REV B 684 3). This area is under review by the NCRP. Because acute risks are manifested soon after exposure and there is an existing data based on gamma-ray induced risks, the research is expected to be completed in about a 5- year period by the NSBRI team. Risk Assessment The Risk Assessment Project has developed acute radiation risk models using a logistic scoring approach and is modifying these models to account for proton and secondary radiation biological effectiveness data. These models will be updated with results from the proposed NSBRI research team when available. A graphical user interface (GUI) of the resulting model will be developed and tested for use in an operational setti ng (Gap Acute 2). Probabilistic models of SPE are being developed by the Risk Assessment project and in coordination with new results from SMD (Gap Acute 5). Shielding Physics & Dosimetry Optimization of radiation shielding (Gap Acute 6), dosimetry, and a lert approaches (Gap Acute 5) is supported with operational research in these areas by both SRPE (Design Tools and Risk Assessment Projects) and the NSBRI and in collaboration with Space Mission Directorate (SMD) Living with the Star Program (Gap Acute 5). The Design Tools project will develop tools to minimize shielding mass during vehicle design, and the Risk Assessment project will develop probabilistic models appropriate for acute risk protection for mission planning purposes. The development of relia ble, lightweight EVA dosimetry is a goal of the research. Biological Countermeasures The important distinctions in the types of biological models, possible BCMs, and exposure conditions between acute, and the risks of cancer, CNS, and degenerative risks suggests a unique approach. Therefore, the SRPE has requested the NSBRI form a focus team in this area (Gap Acute 7). This team will pursue research on the mechanisms of acute radiation risks and possible BCM development. Studies from radiation oncology of anti -nausea drugs will be considered as well as existing drugs used in spaceflight. The role of synergisms of radiation and other space related insults will be an important thrust of this research. Gaps The following gaps are a culmination of research questions identified through the Bioastronautics Roadmap Development, National Academy of Science - Institute of Medicine Review, National Council for Radiation Protection Reviews, Recommendations and Reports, Radiation Discipline Working Group advisory panel recommendations, annual Radiation PI workshops, and the Sept '06 Discipline Review. More recently the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Institute Of Engineering has reported on approaches to Manage Lunar radiation risks (NAS, 2008), and the NAS Institute of Medicine (IOM) has reviewed the Evidence based review of the four major risks and associated Gaps. Based on the above recommendations, a total of 8 Gaps have been formulated for the Risk Acute Radiation Syndromes Due to Solar Particle Events . As with other, the SPRE relies heavily on NRA and NSCOR research, making it difficult to list each task under each gap. The SPRE has chosen to provide a table of Gaps followed by a table of current tasks identifying whether it is solicited, directed, or NSCO R (solicited) and the gaps addressed by that research. The NSBRI has formed the Center for Acute Radiation Research similar in function to an NSCOR, thus this task will be identified as an NSCOR.

The design tools methods will specifically address the limitations associated with simplified geometry description (equivalent aluminum, th ree-layer transport interpolation, random orientation) and straight ahead transport. The design tools increases fidelity by incorporating common spacecraft and user specified materials in the geometry description with ray -by-ray transport to minimize the uncertainties due to range -scaling of material thicknesses and material ordering. Ray -by ray transport also establishes the basis to calculate the forward/backward neutron generation within vehicle/lunar surface geometries. The back -scattered neutron en vironment will be calculated from the opposite sides of the vehicle for a crew member's specific orientation at specific tissue locations. This will increase our ability to evaluate the effectiveness of shielding systems.
