I'm a Licensed Acupuncturist (L.Ac) by the PA State Board of Medicine and am a nationally certified Diplomate of Acupuncture by the NCCAOM. Before becoming an acupuncturist, I obtained my B.A in Spanish and Master of Education from the University of Pittsburgh. I taught Spanish at North Catholic HS and English as a Second Language at The University of Pittsburgh. Coming from a family of teachers, (mom a Nursing professor and dad a Biology professor) I grew up with a strong love for teaching and an interest in health, science, and medicine. I also had a strong interest in foreign languages and cultures. In 2008, I began practicing Tai Chi and Kung Fu which sparked my interest in Eastern medicine and acupuncture\u2014a perfect combination of all of my interests! I first received acupuncture for a knee injury and quickly discovered it treated much more than pain. I had more energy, my mood lifted, and my anxiety and stress melted away. I was so amazed by the incredible benefits I got from acupuncture treatment that I was compelled to learn to perform this wonderful medicine in order to educate others and help them regain and maintain their health through this safe, natural, and effective practice. I am very serious about creating the best treatments for you to the best of my abilities, continuing my education, and educating patients and the public about the benefits of acupuncture. I also enjoy humor and laughter and strive to keep the atmosphere of the clinic warm and peaceful. Many patients have commented on how tranquil and relaxed they feel in the treatment space and send their friends and family to experience it for themselves! I look forward to working with you. -Sarah Heiber, L.Ac PA Medical License #AK001109 Sarah specializes in Five Element Style Acupuncture, Dr. Tan's Balance Method, Motorpoint Acupuncture, and Mei Zen Cosmetic Acupuncture.
