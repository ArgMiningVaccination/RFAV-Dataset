Highly recommended for anyone who feels stuck in life and can't get to where they want to be in all aspects. Grateful to have crossed paths with you. K. Farah I was struggling with weight loss for more than 7 years, on and off with yo-yo diets. Until I came across Mind-body balance with the health coach Reem. It was amazing the way she handled my thoughts and understood my needs. Using proper assessment to analyze what I really need and how I can maintain my health in the long run, not just for a short period of time. She made me comprehend the wheel of health and adjust my state of mind into new healthy habits of eating and exercising. I am into my third month now and it's been great so far. I highly recommend this place. M. Natalia I've known Reem for 16 years on a personal level and and can recommend her as a person full of integrity, trustworthy, and passionate about the work she does. "}
