Presented by Sylvain Cazalet [American Homeopathy was started in Bath.] [The First German Medical School.] [Dr. Helffrich, Johannes. (1795-1852)] American Homeopathy was started in Bath. SCHOOL GAVE DEGREES Wesselhoeft Home, Built in 1828, Still Standing, Was First Hospital. The Borough of Bath, which will celebrate the Bi-Centennial of its founding August 22-26, has as one of its very old houses the Wesselhoeft home, which served as the first hospital and school of homeopathic medicine in America. In the year 1771 at Bath, Rev. Johannes Helffrich served communion to the German settlers. In 1820 his son, Rev. Johan Helffrich, established at his home the Weisenberg Academy, where, with the aid of six German teachers, he educated his two sons and many other young men who afterward became prominent In the arts and professions. In 1824 there came as a teacher from Germany Dr. William Wesselhoeft, who had studied under Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, father of the homeopathic school of medicine. Homeopathy, as established by Dr. Hahnemann, is the art of curing founded on resemblances. Dr. Hahnemann held that disease is cured by remedies which produce on the healthy person effects similar to the symptoms of the complaint of the patient. His remedies were administered in minute-doses. Carrying his enthusiasm for the homeopathic arts over into the new world, Dr. Wesselhoeft made every effort to encourage their practice. He made frequent trips into the wilds above Bath in search of new world herbs for his potions. Dr. Johan Helffrich caught this enthusiasm for homeopathy and established a botanical garden, hothouse and laboratory at his parsonage. Here he and Wesselhoeft, experimented until the year 1828. By that time the fame of the two practitioners had spread so far that the facilities of Rev. Helffrich's house were inadequate to handle the crowds. To alleviate conditions, Rev. Helffrich set up Weiss in the practice of homeopathy and built the house which stands today as the first homeopathic hospital in the United States. A school was operated in conjunction with the hospital. Rev. Helffrich and a hostler at the old Bath Hotel were among the first to receive degrees. After a while the paths of Dr. Wesselhoeft and Rev. Helffrich parted but the old Wesselhoeft home still stands in Bath, only a few doors away from the home of Rev. Reginald Helffrich, a descendant of the original Johannes. Dr. Wesselhoeft later went to Philadelphia and there founded the Hahnemann Hospital and Medical School. Rev. Helffrich continued his interest in homeopathy and education in general. He was one of the founders of the Allentown Academy and received one of the first degres. His medical effects are now in the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, where they constitue a valuable record of the inception and growth of homeopathy in America. Source : Borough of Bath.

Beautifully nestled among the hills, at the head of the Monocacy Valley, which takes its name from the creek bearing the same name, and in the heart of a rich agricultural region and thriving economic area, lies the traditional town of Bath Borough. It is one hundred miles distant from New York, sixty from Philadelphia, eight from Bethlehem and eleven from Easton, the county seat. It is a beautiful town, with its advantage of pure air, beautiful surroundings and charming scenery. No stranger ever visits this locality without being charmed with its hills and valleys. If we ascend \"Siegfried's Hill\", west of town, an unobstructed view of the Monocacy and Lehigh Valleys is had for miles, affording a panoramic scene that seems to dissolve in the haze of the distant mountains. To the north and west, stretches the Kittatiny or \"Endless Mountains'\" and as the eye ranges along its summit, it notes the singular clefts in the range known as the Lehigh and Delaware Water Gaps and the Wind Gap. To the east are visible the lofty church spires of the Moravian town of Nazareth, five miles distant. To our south, lie the South or Lehigh mountains and the City of Bethlehem, with the distinguished seat of learning, Lehigh University, while to the west is clearly seen parts of the City of Allentown, Catasauqua and Northampton. Bath is in reality a part of the Scotch-Irish Settlement which was established in 1728, being the first settlement by white people within the Forks of the Delaware. Bath was laid out by the Scotch-Irish prior to the Revolution. It takes its name from Bath, England, through Margaret DeLancey, a native of that place, who sold tracts of land in this locality to some of the earliest settlers. Mrs. DeLancey was the daughter of William Allen, who served as a lieutenant colonel in the Continental army, but raised a regiment of loyalists in 1778. Bath can authenticate the first white settler's purchase of a parcel of land within the boundaries as it stands today, to the year 1737 when 247 acres of land were purchased and surveyed for Daniel Craig. The lands we talk about are situated along Chestnut Street and to the north of Northampton Street. The lands to the east of the Monocacy, upon which the greater part of Bath lies, remained in William Allen's ownership. In 1776 he conveyed this to his son, Andrew. In 1776, Andrew Allen made an agreement to sell 150 acres to John Lattimore. Andrew Allen also owned the lands on the western bank of the Monocacy. These were confiscated in 1778 and sold to John Sterling, who in turn, sold acres to the Ralston, Berger, Siegfried, and Hirst families. The Siegfried home is a genuine log cabin, standing faithful to its forbearers on West Main Street. Source : Borough of Bath. Thanks to Cathy Kichline - Borough Manager The Allentown Academy : America's First German Medical School. by Ned D. Heindel and Natalie I. Foster The residents of eastern Pennsylvania in the early 19th century were faced with a wide variety of medical alternatives in times of illness. Orthodox physicians with degrees from established medical schools practiced side by side with Pennsylvania Dutch pow-wow doctors with their incantations and charms, Thomsonian herbalists with their patented botanical therapy systems and hydropaths with their beliefs in the curative powers of water. During this time Pennsylvania's German-speaking area proved to be a fertile seed-bed for homeopathy, the leading unorthodox medical system in early America. The Northampton and Lehigh County region became the site of the first homeopathic medical society, medical journal and medical teaching college in America. The medical journal was primarily a German language publication, the language of instruction at the college was exclusively German and the professors were drawn from the Pennsylvania German immigrants in the region. To understand why this unusual medical system germinated and grew in the Lehigh Valley, one must examine the European roots of homeopathic theory and the medical and social climate in this region of Pennsylvania in the early 1800's. The diploma of the North American Academy of Homeopathia was printed in three parts with the wording in English, German and Latin. Homeopathy was the creation of Samuel Christian Hahnemann (1755-1843), a German physician trained at the Universities of Leipzig, Vienna and Erlangen. Hahnemann became disenchanted with the so-called heroic medical practices of the day (bleeding, blistering, purging, leeching) because of the suffering these methods inflicted upon patients. In homeopathy, he espoused a benign therapy regimen concentrating on diet, pure air and a revolutionary concept of medication known as the law of similars. \"Similia similibus curantur\" (let likes be cured by likes) was the central credo of homeopathy. Strictly speaking, this idea was not new with Hahnemann, for Hippocrates had stated in the 4th century BC that \"medicines cure diseases similar to those they produce.\" Hahnemann believed that a medicinal agent could be characterized or \"proven\" by the set of symptoms it caused in a healthy person. The physiological manifestations after dosing with a substance would show the vital powers of the organism that the drug was capable of mobilizing. When an ill person displayed the saure set of symptoms as a result of disease, that disease could be cured by taking the similar - the drug chat produced those same symptoms. In the homeopathic view, the symptoms were really the body's natural defense processes at work fighting the disease, not the disease itself. Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843) formulated the basic law of his new homeopathic medical system (\"similia similibus curantur\" or \"let likes be cured by likes\") in the early 19th century. His first major medical text, The Organon, appeared in 1810 and helped to popularize homeopathy in the New World. Hahnemann also prescribed that homeopathic medicines (extracts and tinctures of plants, minerals, elements and even some animal exudates) be administered in high dilutions. He believed that the potency of a drug was inversely proportional to its concentration: the less one took, the greater the effect for, in fact, the drug was merely stimulating the body's recuperative powers. These two unique theories concerning how medicinal agents functioned and what quantity of a substance should be administered as treatment constituted the main differences between homeopathic and established medicine in the 19th century. The traditional allopaths promoted no unified theory of drug action. They administered large quantities of unpleasant and often downright poisonous substances in an effort to drive illness from a patient. Indeed the idea that medicine had to taste bad to be effective was popularized during this period. Homeopaths relied exlusively on the law of similars to match symptoms with treatments. They usually administered analytically insignificant amounts of medicinal agents to their patients. At least their medicaments did not make a patient feel worse than he already felt. One unwritten law of homeopatily was \"Above all, do not harm.\" The spread of homeopathy was aided by the fact that Hahnemann was a prolific writer. His treatise, Die Organon der homopatischen Heilkunde, originally published in 1810, saw no fewer than five subsequent editions. Numerous other books and medical articles by Hahnemann introduced homeopathy to German-speaking intellectuals in Switzerland, Austria, the German states and among German emigrants. The latter consequently accounted for the entrance of homeopathy into Pennsylvania. With its blend of herbal cures familiar to the folk-medicine practitioners in the area and the German language which was well established in the region due to the presence of a sizeable Pennsylvania Dutch community, the new medical system found a rich and receptive base on which to grow. Its introduction to the new world was due primarily to the influence of four key physicians who converted to homeopathy with an almost messianic zeal. William Wesselhoeft emigrated to the United States from Switzerland early in the 19th century and established a medical practice in Bath, Pennsylvania, several miles northeast of Allentown. He read and studied the Organon, sent to him by his father in 1824, but remained unconvinced of the basic homeopathic philosophy. In addition to founding a busy general practice, Wesselhoeft soon became a very successful and renowned eye surgeon. In 1828 he was confronted by a patient with a fetid polypus of the nose that had been uncurable by allopathic means. He finally tried one of the homeopathic remedies sent to him four years earlier and effected a cure in three months. Fascinated by this development, Wesselhoeft reduced his medical practice drastically and engaged in fulltime study of the new medical system. Wesselhoeft's father supplied him with homeopathic information sent from Europe, as did a friend of his father, Dr. Stapf in Germany. Stapf was a diligent author and provided Wesselhoeft with a complete set of the Archiv Fur die hombopatische Heilkunst, an early German homeopathic journal begun by Stapf in 1821. Wesselhoeft was also shipped homeopathic medicines through the generosity of a college colleague, Dr. Siegrist, of Basel, Switzerland. Dr Henry Detwiller Henry Detweiler arrived in Philadelphia from Basel in 1817. He had studied medicine at the University of Freiburg, Germany, and emigrated just prior to receiving his diploma. After serving as an assistant in the office of Dr. Charles H. Martin in Allentown, he opened his own office in 1818 in Hellertown, twelve miles south of Bath. He did not, in fact, hold an M.D. but degrees were not required at that time for medical practice. Sometime in the mid-1820's, Wesselhoeft and Detweiler became close personal friends and began a series of-informal medical meetings. One of their meeting places was the Moravian Pharmacy at 420 Main Street in Bethlehem. The pharmacist-physician in Bethlehem at that time was Dr. John Eberhard Freitag (17641846), also a German immigrant with a background similar to those of Wesselhoeft and Detweiler. Freitag had been a respected apothecary and lay physician in the Moravian community for many years and had even written a popular treatise on veterinary medicine entitled Der Deutsche Pferde-Arzt. Soon after the commencement of the meetings, Freitag abandoned traditional practice and became a homeopath. Shortly after Freitag's conversion, Dr. John Romig of Allentown joined the group. Romig was a young allopathic physician with a successful practice and an enviable popularity among patients and colleagues alike. The original assembly site for Pennsylvania homeopaths in 1828 was the home of William Wesselhoeft on Chestnut Street in Bath. An informal \"school\" for student homeopaths was held here until about, 1834. These four successful and respected physicians organized in an effort to spread the tenets of the homeopathic system throughout the area. Out of their association grew an informal school of homeopathy in Bath, Pennsylvania. Although the school in Bath never gained official degree-granting status, from 1829 to 1835 it trained many individuals in the homeopathic healing art. Early in the 1830's, however, the group began to explore ways to convert their informal program into a formal degree-granting institution. Dr Constantine Hering (1800-1880) By December, 1833, the four decided they needed a homeopath of considerable eminence to head their school. Dr. Constantine Hering (1800-1880), who had just moved from his missionary post in Paramaribo, Surinam, to Philadelphia, was just such a figure. Although only 33 years old, Dr. Hering was already an internationally known and well-respected homeopathic physician. Hering was to be the spiritual and intellectual cornerstone upon which the homeopathic teaching college was built. On January 1, 1834, the plan for the college to be located in Allentown with Dr. Hering as President and principle instructor was proposed and adopted at a meeting at Dr. Hering's Philadelphia home. Financial backing and legal incorporation were arranged that year and die Nord-Amerikanische Akademie der homo-patischen Heilkunst was officially founded on April 10, 1835. In between the planning and founding of the Academy, the four physicians also established die Northhampton Gesellschaft homopatischer Aerzte (Northhampton Society of Homeopathic Physicians) on August 23, 1834. Six other Lehigh Valley physicians and two clergymen were charter members of this society, the object of which was to advance the practice of homeopathy by interchange of experience and for mutual improvement and encouragement in the study of the healing art. Constantine Hering served as President of the first American homeopathic medical school and as editor of its official journal. After financial failure of the initial efforts in Allentown, Hering and a small group of Philadelphia physicians including Drs. Jacob Jeanes and Walter Williamson, began efforts to recreate a homeopathic school in the Delaware Valley. The Pennsylvania legislature granted a charter on April 8, 1848 to an institution later to become Hahnemann Medical College. Hahnemann Medical College was not the first homeopathic institution, The North American Academy in Allentown bears that distinction. On May 27, 1835 the cornerstone was laid for the main building of the Academy in a festive ceremony featuring an inaugural address by Dr. Hering himself. Two three-story wings of the main building were erected south of Hamilton Street and east of Fourth Street in Allentown; a second building somewhat remote from these was planned to house the chemical laboratory and anatomical and dissecting rooms. The Pennsylvania State Legislature granted the institution a charter of incorporation on June 16, 1836. Instruction commenced immediately thereafter. The faculty consisted of Drs. Hering, Wesselhoeft, Detweiler, Freitag, Romig and J. H. Pulte. Pulte was one of the students at the informal school in Bath. He would go on later to found the Pulte Medical College in Cincinnati, Ohio, and to be named United States ambassador to Austria. That the faculty aspired to high standards of comprehensive education was evidenced in the Constitution and By-Laws of the Academy. This publication was among the first documents issued by the school and was printed in both English and German. The following branches of study were considered indispensible to the complete education of a homeopathic physician: clinical instruction, examination of the sick, pharmacodynamics and materia medica, pharmaceutics and medical botany, dietetics, surgery and obstetrics, medical jurisprudence, general therapeutics, symptomatology and human pathology, anatomy and physiology, zoology, phytology, mineralogy, chemistry, physics, geology, astronomy, mathematics, history of medicine and history of natural science. As preparatory studies, Greek, Latin and German were considered essential for all courses were taught in German, and most of the homeopathic source materials were available in the German language only. The homeopathic medical school which housed the North American Academy was located in Allentown near the intersection of Penn and Hamilton Streets. Constructed in 1835 it was sold by the trustees of the bankrupt Academy in 1843 and passed through successive ownership until its present use as an administration building by the Allentown Public Schools. Prior to their matriculation at the institution, students had to pass preliminary examinations before a committee. Diploma candidates were obligated to pass a colloquium and present curriculum vitae and dissertations on medical subjects. Only those students who had attended a full roster of courses and passed examinations in anatomy, physiology, pathology, Materia Medica homeopathia, homeopathic therapeutics, surgery and obstetrics were entitled to a diploma. The official journal of the Academy was published with articles in either German or English and was edited for most of its brief two-year existence by the President of the Academy, Constantine Hering. An early concern expressed by Romig was that the homeopathic materia medica be presented in a learnable form for the students and that English translations of German sources be prepared. During the first year of instruction, the faculty translated Hahnemann's Organon and Jahr's Manual, a compilation of medicaments and their symptoms. Both translations featured prefaces written by Hering in which he updated information and touted the new school. Romig found the Manual pedagogically unsatisfactory and felt that some source should be provided that collated the properties of well-known drugs and medical case histories of their use. Some of Romig's concerns were answered by the establishment of a journal by the Academy, Correspondenzblatt der Homoeopatischen Aerzte, and its affiliate publication, the Archivzettel. The publication, as its name implied, was a true corresponding journal. Physicians practicing in the community could submit case notes of cures effected homeopathically, questions about medicaments and observations about the utility of new remedies applied homeopathically. Hering served as editor of the journal and frequently commented directly about physicians' submissions, answered questions personally and occasionally wrote extensive editorials on medical issues. This journal appears to be the first American publication devoted exclusively to medicine as opposed to matters of general scientific and scholarly interest. It pre-dated the Journal of the American Medical Association by more than a decade. Most of the articles were published in German, but those received in English were printed in English. Business matters related to the school were often in English, as were announcements regarding the regular meetings of the Homeopathic society. Perhaps this constituted an attempt to reach a wider audience of non-German speaking allopathic physicians and thereby interest them in homeopathy. The main content of the journal consisted of reports on drug provings. \"Proving\" is the homeopathic method of evaluating the efficacy of candidate medicinal agents. Homeopathic physicians would administer small doses of substances to themselves and to healthy, intelligent associates and volunteers and then pain-, stakingly record all signs of the drug's influence. The early history of the drug proving process in America and the results of many provings done in the Lehigh Valley are recorded in the Correspondenzblatt. In a further attempt to collate the known homeopathic materia medica and order new information on provings sent in by numerous physicans, the faculty of the Academy established an archive and appointed an archivist to manage it. The archivist was charged with systematically ordering the results of provings and publishing the results. The archive of the Academy contained: (1) the original hand-written case histories and practical experiences of the homeopathic physicians; (2) a summary of all case histories previously published ordered both by medicament used and symptom treated; (3) an ordered collection of all the disorganized medical signs reported in homeopathic and allopathic writings, and (4) new symptoms of medicaments resulting from provings in progress. The results of this task assumed physical form in the Archivzettel. These pages were published as inserts in the Correspondenzblatt and Hering gave explicit instructions regarding their use. Every subscriber received two copies of each page of the Archivzettel. The pages contained columnar listings of symptoms by key word followed by brief descriptive elaborations. The symptoms were set in Gothic type on the left side of each column and were matched with medicaments set in Roman type listed on the right side of each column. Hering suggested that physicians and students cut the columns into small slips (Zettel), each slip containing a symptom-remedy pair. Because they had two copies of each page, they could then assemble the slips in two different notebooks: one arranged alphabetically by symptom, the other alphabetically by drug. Every physician and student could thereby establish his own private archive of symptoms and medicaments. Segments from the Archivzettel, published as an optional insert in the Corresondenzblatt, and designed to enable its user to establish his own personal archive of homeopathic symptoms and remedies. One of the founders of the Pennsylvania homeopathic movement was Dr. Henry Detweiler. When the Academy closed in 1839, he built an extensive practice in Easton, PA. His home and office occupied a portion of this building he owned there at Third and Northampton Streets, on the central square of the growing city of Easton. Unfortunately, the Correspondenzblatt and Archivzettel had a very short run. Only fourteen issues of the journal appeared at somewhat irregular intervals between October 22, 1835 and February 8, 1837. All of these issues did not contain Archivzettel inserts. The Academy not only officially sponsored the journal but also supplied it with articles and loaned it money. Although no reason is given for the cessation of publication in the final issue, one might conclude that severe financial loss was the cause. Several pleas for prompt payment of subscription fees and additional fees for receipt of the Archivzettel were made in the last few issues. The Academy itself did not last long beyond its journal. The medical school had deposited its funds in an Allentown bank which folded in the financial panic of the late 1830's. Formal instruction terminated in 1839 and although numerous attempts were made to re-fund the institution, a terminal board meeting was convened on June 14, 1843. The termination at this point was merely a formality, as the school had ceased operations four years earlier. The four key physicians and their mentor had long since moved on: Hering to private practice in Philadelphia, Wesselhoeft to Boston, and Freitag, Detweiler and Romig to private practices in Bethlehem, Hellertown and Allentown, respectively. Although the school had been short-lived, the homeopaths associated with it continued to practice and the movement flourished. The translations of homeopathic texts done by Hering and the faculty spread homeopathy outside the German-speaking medical community and the curriculum and organizational structure of the Academy served as a model for the Homeopathic Medical College of Pennsylvania (later to become Hahnemann Medical College) which opened in Philadelphia in 1848. Locally, the physicians who served as the nucleus for the Academy planned and gained control of the Allentown State Hospital, imposing a requirement, removed only in recent years, that its superintendent be a trained homeopath. Homeopathy, with its ideals of benign, patientoriented treatment, was to modify the mainstream of establishment medicine. Consequently, the role played by the homeopathic pioneers in Eastern Pennsylvania during the 19th century deserves an important place in the history of American medicine. The Allentown Medical School, despite its short time of operation, also deserves recognition as a leader in medical education, academic organization, and information dissemination through its publications.

Presented by Sylvain Cazalet Dr John HELFFRICH (1795-1852) Photo : collection Sylvain Cazalet. The following interesting sketch was written expressly for this book by the Dr. Helffrich, a grandson of the old pioneer, and through the courtesy of Dr. F. J. Slough, of Allentown : Johannes Helffrich, an eminent American divine, was born in Weisenberg, Lehigh county, Pa., January 1, 1795. He was a son of the Rev. John Henry Helffrich, of Mosbach, a village in Hesse near Frankfurt on-the-Main, who, after completing his theological studies in the University of Heidelberg, was sent as a missionary to America, by the Synod of Holland in 1774. Soon after his arrival he went to Weisenberg and took charge of the Ziegel's Charge. Here he married, on the 3d of November, 1773, Miss Magdalena Sassamanhaumn and became permanently located. Of the six sons of these parents Johannes Helffrich was the second youngest. When none of these, agreeable to the wish of their father, could make up their minds to enter the ministry, he, as early as his twelfth year, solemnly engaged to realize his father's desire in regard to himself, and was accordingly from that time forth diligently directed in his preparatory studies by his father. In his seventeenth year, after having obtained a thorough preliminary education through private instructors, he went to Philadelphia, with company with Rev. John Zlich, where he pursued his studies for five years under Rev. Dr. Samuel Helfenstine. In the spring of 1816. while young Mr. Helffrich was yet in Philadelphia pursuing his theological studies, he received a call from the Ziegel's Charge, which had become vacant by the death of his father. He accepted the call, and in the autumn of this year he made application to the Synod for examination and licensure, laying at the same time his call before Synod. He was examined, licensed and obtained permission to accept the call. Three years later he received ordination at the Synod of Lancaster. He served this charge to end of his life. His youngest son became his successor, and after the death of his son the grandchild, who still fills the pulpit. Thus the charge continued in service of one family for one hundred and twenty-five years. On the 19th of April, 1818, he was married to Miss Salome Schantz, an accomplished daughter of a prominent family in Lehigh. As that with his wife, so his union with his congregation, he regarded sacred and indissoluable, and consequently to the end of his life he continued to labor in the same field. Mr. Helffrich was very conscientious in the fulfilment of his duties. He was naturally talented and his talent well- developed. He had many commendable characteristics. He was exceedingly firm and decisive in his ways. He wrote out in fall all his sermons, adhering to this practice even in his last years. No one could have persuaded him to enter the pulpit without previous close study. He left behind a vast number of sermons and other productions, which prove the profundity of his scholarship. He was much beloved by his people, and although very decided in carrying out his plans, he never lost the love and respect of his members. Three years after Mr. Helffrich's marriage he purchased a home within a mile from where his father had resided. This home became an attraction in the surrounding community, and until his death he resided in this home. He was a warm friend of the Germans, and consequently his house became a hospitable home for many immigrants. Until his two sons were grown to manhood he kept, at different times, six very able German teachers, who were well versed in the sciences. At this time his home was recognized all over the county as the Weisenberg Academy. He was the means of educating many talented young men who in the community attended this academy mid afterwards became professional and influential men. Thus being associated with thee men of science, it afforded him a good opportunity for developing his ideas in Homoeopathy, of which he was a firm advocate. Among these German professors in the academy was a certain Dr, William, Wesselhoeft, who was educated at a European university. Wesselhoeft was a disciple of Homoeopathy, in later years became a practicing physician in Bath, Northampton county, Pa., and one the founders of Homoeopathy in Lehigh county. Mr. Helffrich being associated with Dr. Wesselhoeft, can attribute the medical training of his mind to this friend, whose medical works he perused and in whose company he made many botanical experiments in order to add new remedies. Also, Dr. Hering, the most prominent homoeopathic physician in Philadelphia, with whom Mr. Helffrich was intimately associated, had great influence upon him and inspired him in his enthusiasm for Homoeopathy. For a number of years Mr. Helffrich, in connection with his pastoral labor, was in the habit of prescribing homoeopathic remedies for the bodily ailments of his members. But this new sphere of practice became burdensome, and finding this strength and health failing through the increase of work, in attempting to carry on both professions, he determined to cease doing any outside practice, and demanded of all patients to call at his home. His home was soon filled with invalids and took the form of a hospital more than an educational institution. In the fall of the year 1830, Mr. Helffrich arranged his work so as to devote two days of the week to medical treatment. On these days as high as twenty to thirty patients were regularly present and the new healing system of Homoeopathy as put to a practical test. Dr Wesselhoeft, who was at this time established in Bath, would make weekly visits to this Weisenberg hospital at Helffrich's home and assist in the treatment of the sick, as well as impart further knowledge to Helffrich in the medical science. Joseph Pulte The result of this clinic and dispensary were very encouraging, and these meetings were kept up until August 23, 1834. On this day was organized a medical society called the Homoeopathic Society of Northampton and Adjacent Counties. The members from Lehigh (at that time Northampton) were Rev. Helffrich, Dr. Roming, Dr. Joseph Pulte and Dr. Adolph Batter. Pulte practiced in Troxlertown, and Bauer in Lyn township. This society held regular meetings at Bethlehem, Allentown and at the residences of its members. Its object was the advancement of Homoeopathy among the profession, interchange of experience and mutual improvement. The result of these meetings was the establishment of a homoeopathic school at Allentown, called the \"North American Academy of the Homoeopathic Healing Art.'' This was the first homoeopathic college in the world. It was founded on the 10th of April, 1835, the eightieth anniversary of the birth of Dr. Hahnemann, the celebrated founder of the homoeopathic system. Dr. Hering, of Philadelphia, was requested to come to Allentown and take charge of the presidency of the nets college. He accepted the call and became the leading spirit of the new institution. The faculty consisted of Drs. Hering, Wesselhoeft, Freytag, Romig, Pulte and Detwiller. In this institution Rev. Helffrich who was one of its founders, received one of the first diploma given. He was not, fully established in the medical art, and instead of a decrease of work at his home and community. He was constantly approached from all sides by applicants for a number of years. His work was growing daily more tedious and burdensome and in order to relieve himself from this continually increasing work, Mr. Helffrich had his eldest son educated in Philadelphia as a physician. His son, John Henry, graduated in 1846, and established himself at the home of his father in Weisenberg. At present he is practicing in Allentown, and is the oldest practicing physician in the county. There are also three grandchildren of the reverend father who are practicing physicians in this county. In 1849 Mr. Helffrich published a German work on homoeopathic veterinary practice. This was the first book on this subject published in this country. Photo : Collection Sylvain Cazalet William Augustus Helffrich (1827-1894) As his eldest son succeeded hint in his medical profession, so his youngest son, Will. A. Helfrich, succeeded him in his ministerial work and perpetuated the honor of his name. Mr. Helffrich enjoyed good health until within about a year of his death, when in consequence of an attack of apoplexy he was unable to preach. On God Friday evening he retired cheerful, and at 11 o'clock in the night he was taken with a second apoplectic attack, when immediately he lost all consciousness. On the following morning, April 8, 1852, he breathed his last, aged 57 years, 2 months and twenty-one days. On the 11 th his funeral took place at the Ziegels Church. During his ministry Mr. Helffrich baptized four thousand live hundred and ninety children ; confirmed between two and three thousand marriages ; solemnized over one thousand burried about fifteen hundred.
