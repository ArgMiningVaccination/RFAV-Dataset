Prior to joining OHSU in 2012, I held academic appointments at INSERM (Paris, France), King's College London (Institute of Psychiatry, London, UK), McGill University (Montreal, Canada) where I developed clinical and research programs. In addition to conducting my own research on the epidemiology of psychiatric disorders in children with special reference to autism, I spend time disseminating scientifically valid information to different professional and non-professional audiences. I was actively involved in the scientific and legal controversy linking autism to childhood vaccines and am still engaged in various academic activities in order to debung that myth. I created and taught in several training programs on autism research in various countries. I have devoted significant time to international efforts to develop advocacy for autism and boost local research and clinical capacity in under-resourced/developing countries including Mexico, China, Oman, Qatar, Kazakhstan, Morocco and Brazil. I am one Editor of the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry. I also enjoy activities with my family, including cooking, reading and playing music. I have four boys and like to hike and ski.
