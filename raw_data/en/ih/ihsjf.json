NOTE regarding the coronavirus: Sunbridge, along with all our Threefold Educational Center neighbors, takes all necessary precautions as recommended by the CDC and mandated by Rockland County to help ensure the health and safety of visitors to our campus. To this end, our cleaning staff is diligently cleaning and disinfecting all door handles, light switches, rest rooms, and general surfaces in our dorms, dining rooms, and classroom buildings. Each guest room at Holder House and Orchard House is cleaned and disinfected when guests check out, and sanitizing and disinfecting materials are available in classrooms and bathrooms.

Dormitory Accommodations Holder House, located just behind the Main House, is the dormitory serving students and visitors to our \"Threefold Community\" campus. Built in 1991 through a partnership of Sunbridge and the Threefold Educational Center, Holder House houses guests from Sunbridge, the Pfeiffer Center, the Seminary of the Christian Community, and Eurythmy Spring Valley. Residents of the 40 guest rooms share the use of four kitchens, thirteen bathrooms, and a coin-operated laundry facility. Reserving a Room Room reservations for Holder House are handled directly through the Threefold Educational Center. Reservations are accepted on a first-come, first-served basis, according to opening dates as specified on the Threefold website, and must be accompanied by a code provided by the affiliated Threefold institution.
