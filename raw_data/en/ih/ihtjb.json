This happens because there is a decrease in the secretion of hormones, oestrogen and progesterone by the ovaries. However, early menopause is noted in Indian women at child bearing age i.e. 24-34 years. Menopause can be distressing when it is accompanied by irregular periods or heavy bleeding, hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings, anxiety, anger, irritability and sleep disturbances. Other symptoms the patient could experience include headaches, dryness of the vagina, Urinary Tract Infections, Low Libido, Poor concentration or memory, bloating or less control over urination. Homoeopathy in Menopause Homeopathy is a truly holistic medicine. If a woman consults a homeopath with menopausal problems - say hot flushes only - the homeopath will still look at the person as a whole, and not just prescribe a remedy for the hot flushes. This is called a constitutional remedy. If we prescribe in this way, the overall imbalance will be treated, the woman's hot flushes will go and her overall health will be improved. Sometimes, we come across women who have no other problems in their life, who just present with some specific menopausal symptoms; in these cases, prescribing on those symptoms alone will solve the problem. HRT (hormone replacement therapy) have known side-effects like bloating, breast tenderness or swelling, leg cramps, headaches and vaginal bleeding. Homeopathy is free from any side-effects. It is preferable to be treated by an experienced homeopath. Homoeopathy is a mind-body medicine. Homoeopathy treats not only the physical complaints, but also targets the mind and gently restores mind-body equilibrium- thus it treats the patient as a whole. Follow these tips to keep yourself healthy and strong during menopause. 1. De-stress Yourself It is important to keep your stress levels in check to prevent a hormonal imbalance. Reduced estrogen production can affect your brain and cause mood swings, anxiety, and depression. However, doing yoga and other breathing relaxation methods are especially effective in fighting menopausal symptoms. Exercising regularly can also help reduce stress. 2. Exercise Daily Exercise is a key component of a healthy lifestyle. You'll feel stronger and happier once you incorporate exercise into your daily routine. It also helps prevent some of the other symptoms of menopause, including mood swings, weight gain, and insomnia. All of these factors are important for maintaining hormonal balance, which promotes healthy hair growth. Choose a form of exercise that works for you. You may want to consider taking a walk with a friend, joining a gym, going for a run, yoga or meditation. 3. Eat a Well Balanced Diet Eating a balanced, low-fat diet is your best defense against hormonal disturbances. Make sure you include an adequate amount of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables in every meal. It's also important to incorporate mono-saturated oils, such as olive oil and sesame oil, into your diet. Essential fatty acids also play a crucial role in maintaining hair health. Your body needs to be hydrated in order to function properly. Load up on water all day long. The amount of water needed varies from person to person and depends on various factors, including overall health and exercise intensity. As a general rule, however, you should aim to have eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day. "}
