However, Traditional Chinese Medicine views this chronic disease as curable over time, with the proper use of herbal medicines and dietary therapy. The onset of ulcerative colitis is often on the left side of the abdomen, and then gradually extends to the entire colon. The cause of the disease is not always immediately clear, but TCM doctors consider \"damp-heat toxicity\" in the large intestine as the primary irritant that leads to Ulcerative Colitis (UC) symptoms. Ulcerative colitis is no ordinary inflammatory disease. The main clinical symptoms of ulcerative colitis are: pain; diarrhea; increased stool frequency (more than four times a day) alternating between dry and thin; blood in the stool; pus; similar symptoms to dysentery; and varying severity of symptoms. These pains tend to be localized in the left lower quadrant of the body. Chinese medical theory believes that ulcerative colitis is caused by the stagnation of damp-heat in the stomach, and further developments of the disease are caused by the stagnation of qi and blood. In TCM understanding, the problem is closely associated with organ dysfunction, in particular the spleen, that causes a failure to self regulate the intestinal environment. TCM specialists generally agree that constitutional weakness, invasion of exogenous pathogens, an unbalanced diet and emotional factors all contribute to the development of the problem. Finally, it appears in spleen and kidney yin and yang deficiency. Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's disease Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are both inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) characterized by recurrent intestinal ulcers, diarrhea, bloody mucus, and abdominal pain. Crohn's affects various parts of the digestive tract (such as the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon), while the impact of ulcerative colitis is often confined to the large intestine. The two diseases' symptoms are very similar, so sometimes even doctors have difficulty making a clear diagnosis. The age of onset for ulcerative colitis is generally from 20 to 50, but it can also be found in children and the elderly. There is no significant difference in incidence between male and female. The most inconvenient aspect of Ulcerative Colitis is that patients can experience sudden onset of the disease symptoms, such as after eating they might need to have a bowel movement instantly. With serious cases, there can be long-term bleeding and anemia, and even shock from blood loss. The symptoms of ulcerative colitis are persistent, and cause great inconvenience as the person is afraid to travel or to go out as they must always stay close to a bathroom. TCM Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis Ulcerative colitis, whether it is treated by Western or Chinese medicine, has been a major problem for decades. Although Western medicine has had some success with vitamin enemas, it is difficult to cure. Therefore, that treatment approach is not ideal. My team and I have researched this difficult disease for 15 years, and in accordance with traditional Chinese herbal formulas, traditional Chinese medicine theory, and modern technology, we have developed a new method for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis. This is a comprehensive treatment of the symptoms which activates blood circulation which dissipates blood stasis, removes rot, cures ulcers, thereby treating both the manifestation and the root cause of the disease. Many ulcerative colitis patients have been healed with this method developed by our team. In 139 cases, 72 were clinically cured, 39 were almost relieved, there was partial remission in 25 cases, and three cases were ineffective. The total effective rate was 97.8%. This is a miraculous method! Typical Ulcerative Colitis Case Patient: Charles, male, 51 years old; chief complaint - suffering from ulcerative colitis. Six years ago, Charles suffered from sudden abdominal pain, diarrhea, and abdominal distension. This was misdiagnosed as appendicitis. Then, in 2008, he had a colonoscopy and was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. Since then, when he became cold he immediately had diarrhea or stool with blood and pus, sometimes 10 times a day. He did not dare go on long journeys as he constantly felt the need for a bowel movement. The disease was agonizing. Charles sought medical attention with us, and subsequently had comprehensive treatment involving multiple visits over the course of seven days. It took approximately seven days for him to heal. Today, his defecation is normal, once a day, with normal stool shape. The abdominal pain and diarrhea have disappeared and it has been nearly two years for Charles without recurrence of the disease. Though the Western colonoscopy was negative, the festering wound has healed. The North American International TCM Treatment Centre (N.A.I. TCM) uses Dr Zhang's natural traditional herbal remedies and professional treatment for ulcerative colitis without surgery, pain, or bleeding, and can work wonders!
